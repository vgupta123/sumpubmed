BACKGROUND
monoterpenes , naturally occurring hydrocarbons, are the main constituents of essential oils and belong to the diverse group of terpenoids, of which more than  <dig> structures are known to date  <cit> . they are produced as secondary plant metabolites and serve diverse functions like signaling, attraction/repellence of pollinators and insects, thermotolerance and are involved in allelopathy  <cit> . atmospheric monoterpene emission from plants was estimated to be  <dig> tg c yr− <dig>  <cit> , with half-lives of minutes to hours in the atmosphere due to their susceptibility to chemical and photooxidative reactions. monoterpenes enter soils by precipitation from the atmosphere, excretion from roots and by leaf fall . the hydrophobic character of monoterpenes causes cell toxicity, mainly by accumulation into and destabilization of the cell membranes  <cit> . below toxic concentrations, microorganisms can use monoterpenes as carbon and energy source for growth. several bacteria have been described to transform monoterpenes in the presence of oxygen as a cosubstrate applying mono- and dioxygenases  <cit> , but also other biotransformations are described  <cit> . linalool, a tertiary monoterpene alcohol , is the main component of essential oils in lavender and coriander. its chemical structure prevents a direct oxidation of the hydroxyl group. hence, another functionalization or isomerization is the initial biological degradation reaction. linalool is oxidized to 8-hydroxylinalool under aerobic conditions  <cit> . in the absence of oxygen, the primary alcohol geraniol is formed in linalool-grown cultures of thauera linaloolentis 47lol   <cit> . this betaproteobacterium was isolated on linalool as sole carbon end energy source under denitrifying conditions  <cit> . a  <dig> -hydroxyl-Δ1-Δ2-mutase was proposed as novel enzymatic function initializing the mineralization of linalool  <cit> .fig.  <dig> linalool isomerase catalyzes the reversible reaction from linalool to geraniol



a similar reaction was described for the bifunctional enzyme linalool dehydratase/isomerase from castellaniella defragrans 65phen. the enzyme catalyzes the reversible hydration of β-myrcene to -linalool and its isomerization to geraniol. it is an oxygen-sensitive, periplasmatic protein of 43 kda including a signal peptide for export  <cit> . the tertiary alcohol 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol  may also be transformed by enzyme-catalyzed isomerization reactions. 232-mb is a metabolite in bacterial degradation of fuel oxygenates. its mineralization may proceed via an initial isomerization to 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol  in aquincola tertiaricarbonis l <dig> and methylibium petroleiphilum pm <dig>  <cit>  as well as in pseudomonas putida mb- <dig>  <cit> . the later was isolated on 232-mb as sole carbon source  <cit> . however, the corresponding enzymes were so far not characterized. for intramolecular hydroxyl-group transfer , only seven different enzyme activities are described:  benzene mutase , isochorismate synthase , 3- phenol mutase , geraniol isomerase ,  <dig> -octadecadienoate 8-hydroperoxide 8r-isomerase ,  <dig> -octadecadienoate 8-hydroperoxide 8s-isomerase  and hydroxyperoxy icosatetraenoate isomerase .

we report the enrichment of the linalool isomerase activity in protein fractions of thauera linaloolentis 47lol and the kinetic properties of the enzyme. a corresponding gene was identified in the draft genome. we suggest to place the linalool isomerase of thauera linaloolentis 47lol as a new member in the enzyme family of intramolecular hydroxyl group transferases  with the ec number  <dig> . <dig>  next to the geraniol isomerase function of the linalool dehydratase/isomerase from castellaniella defragrans 65phen.

RESULTS
identification of a candidate protein for linalool isomerase
the linalool dehydratase/isomerase  was used in similarity searches to identify a putative linalool isomerase protein in a draft genome of t. linaloolentis 47lol. one protein showed a considerable similarity with an overall amino acid identity of 20 % . the corresponding gene is isolated from the adjacent genes  and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, an isoelectric point of  <dig>  and a hydrophobicity of − <dig>    <cit> . no signal peptide was predicted by the signalp software. for the n-terminus, four transmembrane domains within the first  <dig> amino acids were predicted together with a localization in the inner membrane with the c-terminal protein fold in the cytoplasm. conserved domains as described in pfam were not present. the specific hydrophobicity values  were  <dig>  and − <dig>  for the n- and c-terminal parts of the protein . the similarity to the ldi was restricted to the c-terminal domain. such a location at the cytoplasmic site of the inner membrane seems to be ideal for a catabolic enzyme acting on a hydrophobic substrate. this may maximize the contact with the substrate and reduces the intracellular concentration, but also produces geraniol for the next catabolic enzymes that likely depend on cytoplasmatic nad+ as electron acceptor. in contrast, the periplasmatic location of ldi is optimal for a defense enzyme. myrcene is less toxic than the alcohols and can diffuse into the environment of the cell, thus keeping the damage at the inner membrane to a minimum.

enrichment of the linalool isomerase activity 
lis activity was determined as geraniol isomerase activity and was detected in crude cell-free protein extracts also containing membrane fragments after application of high pressure cell disruption. cell disintegration by osmosis or ultra sonification retained the activity in the membrane fraction. due to the large cytoplasmatic domain of the candidate protein, we attempted the isolation as soluble enzyme from dialyzed crude extracts. the ph was increased to  <dig>  to eventually increase the anionic character of the enzyme. the enzyme activity did not bind to a deae column. after ammonium sulfate addition , the enzyme activity was retained on a phenyl-sepharose column and eluted with pure water. a strong binding to hydrophobic columns has also been observed for ldi  <cit>  and other monoterpene-transforming enzymes  <cit> . a size determination of the eluted fraction on a size-exclusion column yielded a molecular weight of over 600 kda, as native protein in phosphate buffer as well as in the presence of urea as denaturant. visualization of the proteins on sds-page revealed the presence of many proteins, including abundant proteins between  <dig> and 70 kda and around 33 kda .

the large size together with the predicted membrane association of the lis candidate gene suggested an alternative purification approach, a subcellular fractionation including a sucrose-gradient centrifugation for the identification of membrane-associated proteins. first, the outer membrane and periplasmatic proteins were removed by spheroplast formation. after disintegration by high pressure release, the inner membrane  fraction was separated from the cytosolic soluble protein  fraction by ultracentrifugation . total lis activity was five times higher in the membrane fraction than in the soluble fraction  . both fractions were separated on sucrose gradients. the lis activity of the membrane fraction  was concentrated in two fractions with a sucrose density between  <dig>  and  <dig>  g ml− <dig> . for the soluble protein fraction , lis activity was also concentrated in the fractions with the aforementioned sucrose content . protein gels revealed an enrichment of proteins with a molecular size between  <dig> and 70 kda and around 32 kda for the active fractions from im and sp. lis activity was deposited from the active fractions  by decrease of the sucrose concentration and ultracentrifugation. sds-page characterized the dissolved pellet as containing an approx. 60 kda protein as most abundant protein . this purification stage was used for enzyme kinetics.table  <dig> enrichment of lis activity from spheroplasts of t. linaloolentis 47lol

particles with a svedberg constant of above 158 s were separated from the soluble fraction. high pressure cell disintegration produces a number of small membrane fragments and vesicles. small vesicles  settle with a sedimentation coefficient between  <dig> and 10000 s  <cit> . we conclude from our observations that the lis activity is located on a protein associated with the inner membrane. only a minor fraction of the total enzyme activity, present as small membrane-protein aggregates, was enriched in the fraction that is traditionally considered to contain only cytosolic proteins.

the protein gels showed consistently protein between  <dig> and 70 kda in fractions with lis activity. maldi-tof mass spectroscopy identified the protein band at approx. 60 kda from several gels as ncbi:eno <dig>  the protein that was predicted to be a candidate for the linalool isomerase. the discrepancy between the calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and the observed weight of between  <dig> and 70 kda is likely a result of the hydrophobic nature of the protein. hydrophobic proteins, including membrane proteins tend to bind more sds and show a faster migration in denaturing gel electrophoreses  <cit> .

further purification of the lis activity was not successful, as a detergent-mediated release of the protein from the membrane was impaired by irreversible inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity. detergents aid solubility of membrane proteins but also have an adverse effect on stability and functionality of proteins  <cit> . terpenoid synthases were shown to have a rather hydrophobic core shielding the catalytic center from surrounding bulk solvent  <cit> . also the lis may have a hydrophobic protein domain sensitive to detergents that change the conformation into a non-active state.

heterologous gene expression
expression of the native lis gene in e.coli bl <dig> yielded an induced protein band around 60 kda . no inclusion bodies were observed. the expressed protein was located in the membrane fraction, but lis activity was not observed in crude cell extracts or in cell-free protein fractions. expression of a n-terminally truncated version of the linalool isomerase, representing the cytosolic part of the enzyme only, yielded a soluble protein that also did not show activity. the lis gene did not have rare codons. the folding in e.coli may have been incorrect.fig.  <dig> sds-page of heterologous expression of the lis gene in e. coli bl <dig> pet42-lis.  cells from induced culture,  crude protein extract after cell disintegration and  soluble protein fraction after ultracentrifugation



characterization of linalool isomerase activity
the lis activity was enriched without a chemical reductant in the buffer and enzymatically inactive. activity was restored by addition of a reducing agent and under anoxic conditions in the enzyme assay. the activation could be initiated by cationic , neutral  or anionic  compounds. however, maximum activity was measured with 4 mm dithionite . a large excess of reductant caused a decrease in activity, e.g. 10 mm dithionite or 8 mm dtt were less suitable for activation . lis activity was determined in the thermodynamically favorable direction from geraniol to linalool  <cit>  and was observed between ph  <dig> and  <dig> , with an optimum around ph  <dig>  the temperature optimum was 35 °c and the activation energy was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kj mol− <dig>  for comparison, the ph and temperature optimum of the ldi enzyme were at ph  <dig> and 35 °c, respectively, and the activation energy was  <dig>  kj mol− <dig>  <cit> . geraniol formation from linalool was detected within 4 h of incubation . kinetic parameters were determined with the most enriched sample in duplicates for the geraniol isomerization to linalool. the enzyme followed michaelis-menten-kinetics with an apparent km-value of 455 ± 124 μm and a vmax of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nkat * mg protein− <dig> . a similar substrate affinity was determined for the linalool dehydratase/isomerase . maximal velocity was higher for the ldi  than for the lis, however, the purification level for lis was lower, and we do not know whether part of the enzyme is in an inactive state. lis did not show a stereospecificity towards linalool isomers: both  and -linalool were formed . in contrast, the ldi accepts only -linalool as a substrate  <cit> .table  <dig> influence of different reducing agents on lis activity

earlier studies already showed the regiospecific formation of geraniol from linalool without nerol formation  <cit> . to confirm the regioselectivity, lis activity was tested with nerol or citronellol and in combination with geraniol. no activity was measured with nerol or citronellol alone. linalool isomerase activity dropped to approx. 50 % in the presence of nerol. activity in the presence of citronellol and geraniol was barely detectable. thus, the enzyme is regioselective and seems to bind nerol with a similar affinity as geraniol, whereas citronellol which lacks the c2-c <dig> double bond is stronger bound than geraniol.

uv-vis spectroscopy in a range of 200–800 nm did not provide evidence for the presence of cofactors. cofactor-independent enzymes are known for allylic rearrangements that are catalyzed by acid-base mechanisms  <cit> . the isomerization of geraniol to linalool requires a protonation of the hydroxyl group to leave as water, and a shift in electron density leading to a tertiary carbocation intermediate which may be attacked by water or a hydroxyl ion, resulting in the formation of linalool.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a linalool isomerase in t. linaloolentis 47lol by partial protein purification. the gene encodes a two-domain protein with a n-terminal anchor in the inner membrane that is characterized by four transmembrane helices and a c-terminal cytosolic domain which showed considerable similarity to the linalool dehydratase/isomerase from c. defragrans 65phen. the enzyme is active in the reduced state and sensitive towards detergents. it expands the enzyme class of intramolecular hydroxyl group transferases as a new member, linalool isomerase .
