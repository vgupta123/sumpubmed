BACKGROUND
zinc finger proteins, a large family in eukaryotes, make tandem contacts with their target molecules, such as the metal ion zinc, dna, rna, proteins and lipids, through their zinc finger  motifs  <cit> . their binding properties depend on the znf domain’s sequence, the number of znf domains and the protein’s higher-order structures  <cit> . the ccchs, a unique subfamily of znf proteins, feature a characteristic motif comprising of three cys and one his residues  <cit> . the number of ccch proteins varies across diploid plant species, from  <dig> in medicago truncatula  <cit>  to  <dig> in poplar tree   <cit> . so far, most identified ccch proteins in plant species have one to six ccch motifs  <cit> . the consensus sequence of the ccch motif can be further classified according to the number of amino acid between the cys and his residues in the ccch motif, and most ccch motifs contains c-x4–15-c-x4–6-c-x3–4-h sequence   <cit> .

in planta, ccch genes play pivotal roles in cell fate specification and hormone-regulated stress responses. till now, most reported plant ccch genes were identified through differential expression analyses  or forward genetics approaches . for example, atpei <dig>  an embryo-specific ccch gene that is indispensable for heart-stage embryo formation, was first isolated using a virtual subtraction method from the cdna library of arabidopsis embryos  <cit> . using a differential hybridization screening, a cotton ccch gene, ghzfp <dig>  was isolated, which functions through interacting with a dehydration protein and a pathogenesis-related protein to positively regulate both salt tolerance and disease resistance  <cit> . through microarray studies, attzf <dig>  <cit>  and osdos  <cit>  were identified as differentially expressed genes to sugar response or during pollination, respectively. overexpressing attzf <dig> resulted in compact statured plants, late flowering and higher stress-tolerance through positively regulating abscisic acid /sugar responses and negatively regulates gibberellic acid  responses  <cit> ; while overexpressing osdos in rice produced a marked delay of leaf senescence primarily through negatively regulating the jasmonic acid  pathway  <cit> . through the screening of developmental or salt-sensitive mutants and a map-based cloning approach , arabidopsis genes athua <dig> and atszf1/ <dig> were identified and cloned  <cit> . athua <dig> acts in floral morphogenesis by specifically processing agamous pre-mrnas  <cit> ; while atszf <dig> and atszf <dig> negatively regulate the expression of many salt-responsive genes and positively modulate the tolerance of arabidopsis to salt stress  <cit> .

homologous gene analysis is another useful method to discover important genetic components. for example, ccch genes ostzf <dig> and attzf2/3/4/5/ <dig> were identified in this way. ostzf <dig> was isolated as the rice ortholog to attzf <dig>  <cit> . expression of ostzf <dig> is induced by drought, salt, hydrogen peroxide, as well as aba, ja and salicylic acid   <cit> . overexpression of ostzf <dig> in transgenic rice has delayed seed germination, delayed leaf senescence, and enhanced tolerances to drought and salt stress, through regulating the downstream genes’ pre-mrna stability by directly binding to u-rich regions in the 3’ -utrs  <cit> . arabidopsis genes, attzf2/3/4/5/ <dig>  were studied as close paralogous genes to attzf <dig>  <cit> . the expression patterns of attzf2/ <dig> are similar to attzf <dig> and transcripts of these two genes can be found in various vegetative tissues and in flowers. similar to ostzf <dig>  overexpression of attzf2/ <dig> caused delayed senescence, enhanced longevity, and larger plants at the mature stage  <cit> . unlike those of attzf1/2/ <dig>  expression of attzf4/5/ <dig> are specific to seeds  <cit> . the expression levels of attzf4/5/ <dig> decline during seed imbibition, and are up-regulated by aba and down-regulated by ga. mutant analysis showed that attzf4/5/ <dig> are negative regulators for light- and ga-mediated seed germination responses by controlling genes critical for aba and ga responses  <cit> .

switchgrass  is a warm-season c <dig> perennial grass used for bioenergy and animal feedstock  <cit> . to avoid competing with food crops for arable field, a large proportion of switchgrass fields will be located on marginal lands where various abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought, and extreme temperatures, limit plant growth. translating the knowledge gained from the study of model plant species, such as arabidopsis, into crop species has contributed to improving important agronomic problems in major food crops  <cit> . for example, an arabidopsis gene, sodium proton exchanger  <dig> , was identified as a key regulator of salt tolerance in arabidopsis. when atnhx <dig> was overexpressed in brassica napus, tomato, and rice, all of the transgenic plants acquired a significant improvement in salt tolerance  <cit> .

ccch genes have great potential for plant genetic improvement. mutant selection, differential gene expression, and homologous gene analyses are three classical approaches to identify important ccch genes as described previously. however, since switchgrass is a self-incompatible grass with a complex allotetraploid genome, it is difficult to pinpoint important genes/loci in switchgrass using forward genetic tools . comprehensive gene family analysis combined with translational genomics provides an unprecedented opportunity to predict potential functions of ccch genes. for example, wang et al. predicted that certain subfamilies of the ccch proteins in arabidopsis were involved in stress tolerances, and showed that the subfamily ix gene members responded to salt, aba, drought, and cold stresses  <cit> . also, peng et al. showed that ccch subfamily i genes in maize were responsive to aba and drought stimuli  <cit> . it is rational to adopt this strategy to conduct genome-wide comprehensive analysis on switchgrass ccch genes as well.

the latest version of the switchgrass genome database  includes 15× sequence coverage of the genome with about  <dig> × from long linear reads  <cit> ; in addition, over 93% of the protein-coding genes have been annotated  <cit> . this genomic dataset together with the transcriptomic databases   <cit>  provide us with a quality framework to address questions of biological significance from the perspective of genetic components. here we make use of the publicly available switchgrass genomic  <cit>  and transcriptomic  <cit>  databases to systematically analyze ccch gene family and to identify candidate genes contributing to plant development and stress tolerance in switchgrass.

RESULTS
identification of ccch proteins in switchgrass
the newly released genome database of “panicum virgatum v <dig> , doe-jgi”  <cit>  was used in this study. after extensive searches of the database with the hidden markov model  file pf <dig> and manual analysis to remove the false positive and redundant genes, a total of  <dig> switchgrass ccch genes were identified and designated as pvc3h <dig> to pvc3h <dig> . the complex allotetraploid genetic background of lowland switchgrass makes it a great challenge to assemble the two sets of heterozygous genomes and reach chromosome-scale contiguity  <cit> . in this study, we obtained complete sequences of  <dig> pvc3hs from the genome database  and another  <dig> full length pvc3hs from the transcriptome data   <cit>  by aligning and joining overlapping transcripts. three pvc3hs’ sequences were incomplete . the deduced full lengths of pvc3h proteins ranged from 121aa to 1358aa, among which only two were more than 1000aa in length .

the number of ccch motifs in pvc3h proteins was calculated using the pfam and smart programs. as shown in figure  <dig>  there were a total of  <dig> ccch motifs in pvc3h proteins, which was comparable to that of maize  and higher than rice  and arabidopsis  . the pvc3h proteins had one to six ccch motifs per protein . notably, the number of pvc3hs with only one ccch motif  was much higher than that of arabidopsis , rice  and maize .figure  <dig>

the classical ccch motif was defined as c-x4–15-c-x4–6-c-x3-h  <cit> . according to the spacer numbers in-between the cys residues, the ccch motif could be classified into different patterns. in switchgrass and the other three plant species, the most common ccch motifs had patterns of c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h and c-x7-c-x5-c-x3-h. rare ccch motif patterns were also found among pvc3hs: two had motifs of c-x16-c-x5-c-x3-h, six had c-x17-c-x4-c-x3-h, one had c-x17-c-x5-c-x3-h, and one had c-x17-c-x6-c-x3-h . notably, the motif pattern of c-x17-c-x4–6-c-x3-h was only found once in a maize ccch protein, zmc3h <dig>  <cit> .

the sequence logos of the four most common types of ccch motifs were compared between switchgrass, maize, rice and arabidopsis. as illustrated in additional file  <dig>  the two most common ccch motif patterns had different sequence logos. within each motif pattern, sequence logos were found to be similar across the four plant species, and the degree of similarity between the four plant species was consistent with their phylogenetic relationships .

phylogenetic and structural analyses
we constructed neighbor-joining  phylogenetic trees to illustrate the evolutionary relationships between the pvc3hs  and between all identified ccch proteins in switchgrass, maize, rice and arabidopsis . we determined the relationships  between proteins and identified a total of  <dig> clades including  <dig> pvc3hs with the rest nine pvc3hs as singletons based on bootstrap value > <dig> . pvc3hs within the same clade shared similar exon-intron structures of their encoding genes  and similar numbers and distributions of functional motifs . despite the variable lengths and sequences of introns, the number of introns and the lengths of individual exons were highly similar across the pvc3hs within the same clade. conserved exon-intron structures and motif distribution orders across the pvc3hs in each clade strongly supported the reliability of the phylogenetic tree. taking clade-xx & -xxi pvc3hs as examples, proteins in clade-xx had one rna-recognition motif  near to the n- terminal and two ccch motifs after the rrm; while most clade-xxi proteins had two ccch motifs and one rrm in-between.figure  <dig>

ccch proteins have been found to regulate post-transcriptional modification of downstream target pre-mrnas  <cit> , interacting with different proteins   <cit> , or transcriptionally activating/repressing target genes   <cit> . functional motifs found among pvc3hs include rrms and k homolog domains  that are involved in rna processing, and ankyrin repeats , wd <dig> repeats  and ring motifs that are involved in protein-protein interactions or multi-protein complex assembly . specifically, pvc3hs in clades-xvii, −xx, and -xxi had one or two rrm motifs  suggesting pvc3hs within these three clades could have conserved roles through processing downstream target mrnas.

the ccch families in arabidopsis, rice, maize and switchgrass were further compared . most ccch genes were clustered with their paralogs in the same species. except for a few species-specific genes, most rice and maize ccch genes had one or a pair of orthologs in switchgrass . we attempted to find pvc3hs which were orthologous to functionally-annotated arabidopsis and rice ccch proteins, and found that aba- or stress-responsive ccch genes, such as ostzf <dig>  <cit> , osdos  <cit> , attzf1/2/ <dig>  <cit> , and atszf1/ <dig>  <cit>  were orthologous to the clade-xiv pvc3h genes, osc3h <dig>  <cit>  was orthologous to pvc3h38/ <dig> in clade-i, athua <dig>  <cit>  was orthologous to pvc3h35/ <dig> in clade i, and oslic  <cit>  was orthologous to pvc3h27/ <dig> in clade-ix .figure  <dig>

chromosomal locations and duplications in homeologous chromosomes
according to okada et al.  <cit> , allotetraploid switchgrass had two subgenomes, designated as a and b. in this study, chromosomal  localizations of  <dig> pvc3hs were found in the two subgenomes which were unevenly distributed on  <dig> chromosomes of nine homeologous pairs. according to the phylogenetic tree , we linked the paralogous pairs of pvc3hs, and found a total of  <dig> pairs of paralogous pvc3hs with defined chr. locations . most of these  <dig> pairs were in homeologous chromosomes with only one exception . tandem gene duplication was defined as paralogous genes physically linked in tandem with less than five gene loci in-between. with that definition, three tandem duplications were found: pvc3h5/ <dig> on chr1a, pvc3h32/ <dig> on chr5a, and pvc3h41/ <dig> on chr5b. among maize ccch proteins, two tandem duplications were also found   <cit> . we checked whether these tandem gene duplications were within large microsyntenous regions between switchgrass and maize. as illustrated in the additional file  <dig>  pvc3h29/32/ <dig> on switchgrass chr5a and zmc3h12/13/ <dig> on maize chr <dig>  and pvc3h41/42/ <dig> on switchgrass chr5b and zmc3h46/47/ <dig> on maize chr <dig> were two syntenic gene sets. the conservation and micro-colinearity of ccch genes suggest a common origin of these genes.figure  <dig>

s. for those with unknown chr locations, we listed them on the right side of the figure. duplications caused by allotetraploidy were connected by dashed red lines  or blue lines. tandem duplications were marked by red bars.



fixation of advantageous mutations usually leads to evolutionary innovations and species divergences , while the removal of deleterious alleles or mutations maintains the natural fitness of species . here, we adopted phylogenetic comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates to tell the selection mode between pvc3h paralogous genes . a total of  <dig> paralogous pairs  of pvc3hs with defined chr locations were compared, among which  <dig> pairs were caused by allotetraploidy , and  <dig> pairs of tandem duplicated genes. according to the ka/ks ratio,  <dig> %  ccch gene pairs were under diversifying selection. this percentage is much higher than that found in maize   <cit> . furthermore, homeologous genes’ divergence time was estimated to be 3– <dig>  million years ago ; three tandem duplicated genes diverged  <dig> - <dig>  mya; while the pair  on non-homeologous chromosomes diverged  <dig>  mya. it was estimated that the two diploid progenitors of tetraploid switchgrass diverged ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . therefore, the tandem duplicated pairs happened before the divergence of the progenitors. according to blanc and wolfe young duplicates  would be more prone to recombine and disappear  <cit> . therefore the unusual age profile of paralogous genes in tandem or in non-homeologous chromosomes indicates that their corresponding duplicated homeologous genes might have been deleted during the evolution. in short, duplications by allotetraploidy remained as the primary cause for the high number of ccch genes in switchgrass and a high percentage of ccch genes were under diversifying selection.table  <dig>

organ/tissue-level pvc3hs expression atlas discovered genes potentially involved in development of highly lignified cells and florets
the expression patterns of  <dig> pvc3hs in  <dig> different organs, tissues and developmental stages were analyzed using data mined from the switchgrass gene expression atlas   <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  genes  and samples were clustered according to their corresponding expression patterns. samples from vegetative organs/tissues and from reproductive organs were separated into two clusters. notably, most probes detected relatively high transcripts levels with non-specific probes cross-hybridizing with a set of sequences  and mixed probe sets  containing at least one probe that cross-hybridized with other sequences. gene-specific probes  detected that only seven pvc3h genes  had relatively high expression levels in most organs/tissues. the gene expression atlas of  <dig> pairs of paralogous pvc3hs were also compared . for the  <dig> pairs of ccch genes under purifying selection,  <dig> pairs have similar organ/tissue-level expression patterns ; while for the rest of the  <dig> pairs under diversifying selection, only two pairs were similar  .figure  <dig>

the organ/tissue-level gene expression atlas is useful for predicting the functions of pvc3hs, especially for those potentially involved in plant development. for example, the pvc3h36-specific probe detected the gene only had high expression levels in lignified organs/tissues , but not in less lignified tissues , suggesting the potential role of pvc3h <dig> in the identity of lignified cells. another interesting gene, pvc3h <dig>  had expression levels in vascular bundles > nodes/internodes > leaf sheath > leaf blade, suggesting that this gene could be vascular cell-specific .

in another case, gene-specific probes detected that five genes  had higher expression levels in florets and inflorescence meristems, suggesting that these five genes could be involved in switchgrass flower development. interestingly, pvc3h <dig> and − <dig> were homologous to athua <dig> , reiterating their potential roles in regulating switchgrass flower development.

promoter and qrt-pcr analyses highlighted clade-xiv pvc3h genes as aba- and stress-responsive
we found that pvc3hs in clade-xiv were homologous to aba- or stress-responsive ccch genes in arabidopsis and rice . we first performed a promoter analysis with six pvc3hs in clade-xiv whose promoter sequences  were available in the switchgrass genome database  <cit>  . cis-elements, such as aba responsive element , dehydration-responsive element , c-repeat binding factors , and low temperature responsive element  of clade-xiv genes’ promoters were shown in figure  <dig>  all six pvc3hs in clade-xiv had multiple abre elements, and four pvc3hs had multiple dres or cbfhvs/ltres in their − <dig>  kb promoter regions. the promoter analysis suggested that clade-xiv genes should be responsive to aba and stresses.figure  <dig>

s. stress-related cis-elements of the − <dig> kb 5′ upstream region of six pvc3hs were shown. cis-elements in the sense-strand were indicated above the line, and those in the complementary-strand below the line.



to validate this hypothesis, we carried out qrt-pcr with eight pvc3hs in clade-xiv to see whether or not these genes were responsive to aba and various stresses. meanwhile, another two pvc3hs  with fewer abres and dres in their promoters were picked as controls in the qrt-pcr experiment. using the cut-off value of 2-fold change, we found that the transcript levels of all eight pvc3hs in clade-xiv but not pvc3h <dig> & - <dig>  were dramatically induced under one or more stress treatments . in particular, the expression levels of pvc3h <dig> and pvc3h <dig>  orthologs to osdos , were drastically induced by cold treatment . pvc3h <dig> and pvc3h <dig>  orthologs to ostzf <dig> , remarkably responded to aba treatment . the transcript level of pvc3h <dig> increased to 9-fold after 24 hrs salt treatment and the transcript levels of pvc3h12/62/ <dig> increased to more than 5-fold after one or more of the stress treatments within 48 hrs.figure  <dig>

discussion
large number of ccch genes and higher percentage of them under diversifying selection reflect recent allopolyploidization event in tetraploid switchgrass
the estimated genome size of tetraploid switchgrass is ~ <dig>  mb  <cit> , which is smaller than that of maize   <cit> , but much bigger than that of rice   <cit> . the gene density in switchgrass was ~ <dig>  kb per gene  <cit> , similar to rice   <cit> , but lower than maize   <cit> . counting the genome size and average gene density, we can conclude that the number of genes in tetraploid switchgrass is ~ <dig>  times and ~ <dig>  times the number of genes in maize and rice, respectively. consistently, the number of ccch genes in switchgrass  is ~ <dig>  times that in maize . yet, inconsistent with the above calculation, the number of ccch genes in maize  and rice  are nearly the same.

the poaceae family experienced a process of paleopolyploidization which happened around  <dig> mya  <cit>  and a subsequent “diploidization” process ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . rice and the common ancestor of maize and sorghum diverged ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . although maize genome went through additional whole-genome duplication ~5- <dig> mya, at least 50% of its duplicated genes lost one or both member over the past  <dig> million years  <cit> . more likely, the maize ccch genes have undergone extensive gene loss or diversification process after the whole-genome duplication event, which ultimately lead to the current number of ccch genes in maize.

the tribes paniceae  and maydeae  diverged ~  <dig> mya  <cit> . it was proposed that the two sets of subgenomes of switchgrass originated from two closely related diploid progenitors which diverged less than  <dig> mya, and the polyploidization events less than  <dig> mya through comparing nucleotide substitution of the acetyl-coa carboxylase genes in homeologous chromosomes  <cit> . this estimation for the divergence time by huang et al.  <cit>  was largely consistent with our finding with ccch genes that a large number of pvc3h gene pairs between homeologous chromosomes diverged ~ <dig> mya . meanwhile,  <dig> out of  <dig> pairs of paralogous pvc3hs with defined chr. locations were on corresponding homeologous chromosomes, accounting for  <dig> % of the gene duplication event, which confirms that the two sets of subgenomes were originated from closely-related diploid grasses. after the allotetraploidization event in switchgrass, we would expect a similar gene loss process which occurred during maize evolution. yet, the short time window  after polyploidization allowed the existence of redundant homeologous ccch genes, even though a large percentage of them  are under diversifying selection. taken together, the recent divergence of switchgrass diploid progenitors and the polyploidization event sufficiently account for the higher number of ccch genes in the tetraploid switchgrass genome. a flowchart was drawn for better illustration of the above reasoning .figure  <dig> 
flow chart illustration of comparative evolutionary events in switchgrass and maize.




polyploidy is an important route for fast evolution in flowering plants  <cit> . switchgrass is a self-incompatible out-crossing ployploid grass. according to its native growth habitats and phenotypic features, switchgrass was classified into lowland and upland ecotypes  <cit> . the lowland ecotypes were mainly tetraploid , while the upland varied from tetraploid, hexaploid  to octoploid   <cit> . associated with the allopolyploid genome arising from combinations of divergent diploids, the tetraploid switchgrass is disomic inheritance  <cit> . in contrast to polysomic inheritance, disomic inheritance in polyploids presents opportunities for duplicated genes to diverge and evolve new functions  <cit> . consistent with this theory, we found  <dig> % ccch gene pairs were under diversifying selection in this study. a total of  <dig> pvc3hs were potentially panicum-specific , for which no ortholog  was found among maize, rice and arabidopsis ccch genes . this result suggests that these newly evolved genes and genes under diversifying selection could have different functions which ultimately allowed the successful adaptation of switchgrass across a wide geographical area in the north america.

ccch gene family analysis facilitated functional gene discovery
ccch type znf proteins share an ancient origin which now can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. plant ccch genes play important roles in plant development, and abiotic and biotic stress responses. the order and logo of ccch motifs, exon-intron structures, and presence and distribution of other functional domains in each clade were highly conserved, implying that genes in the same clade could have conserved or similar functions across di- and monocotyledonous plant species. using the blast2go program  <cit> , we listed the estimated functions of all pvc3h genes in additional file  <dig> 

based on the phylogenetic analysis, uniform gene structure, conserved domains and genomic contexts, we established orthologous relationship between  <dig> well-characterized ccch genes in model plants and switchgrass . most characterized arabidopsis, rice and cotton ccch genes are homologous to clade-xiv pvc3hs which were aba- and stress-responsive. over-expressing atoxs <dig>  atszf1/ <dig>  ostzf <dig>  attzf1/ <dig>  and ghzfp <dig> all lead to improved stress tolerance  <cit> . overexpressing ostzf <dig> and osdos also delayed leaf senescence in rice  <cit> . attzf4/5/ <dig> and osgzf <dig> encoded functional proteins regulating embryo maturity and/or seed germination  <cit> . it is still unknown whether or not over-expressing attzf4/5/ <dig> and osgzf <dig> could improve plant stress tolerance, but gene expression data showed that at least attzf4/5/ <dig> were aba responsive  <cit> . therefore, it is safe to hypothesize that most pvc3hs in clade-xiv were aba- and/or stress-responsive and potentially involved in plant stress signaling pathways. this hypothesis was further supported by the promoter and gene expression analyses.

we were able to find switchgrass orthologs to osc3h <dig>  athua <dig> and oslic. osc3h <dig> quantitatively contribute to defense against bacterial pathogens in rice likely through the ja-dependent pathway  <cit> . osc3h <dig> was homologous to clade-i pvc3hs with the distinct feature of five ccch motifs with three at the n-terminal and two at the c-terminal. for switchgrass, pathogenic diseases  are a potential threat if the bioenergy plant were grown in large scales. identifying quantitative trait loci for disease resistance would be important for breeding switchgrass cultivars with long-term disease resistant trait.

two switchgrass orthologs  to oslic were found, which could be involved in the establishment of grass architecture. overexpressing oslic in rice induced the ‘erect-leaf’ phenotype through reducing the leaf angle against the stem  <cit> . small leaf angles  greatly contributed to a high leaf area index  to increase light perception for photosynthesis, especially in dense planting field  <cit> . switchgrass is a bunch-type grass with robust tillers but no rhizome or stolon. therefore, reducing shading effect of the upper leaves through adjusting leaf angles should be a promising way to improve its biomass yield per unit of land area, and pvc3h27/ <dig> would be good candidate genes to work with for such purposes.

two functional-annotated genes  found no orthologs in switchgrass. osehd <dig> encoded an oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiod flowering in rice, which could be a rare ccch gene resulted from diversifying selection. atfes <dig>  an arabidopsis gene, was essential for the winter-annual habit of the herb by genetically suppressing fri-mediated vernalization. therefore, it was not surprising to see that the perennial grass switchgrass had no orthologs to atfes <dig>  this result was consistent with the gene duplication and divergence analysis. on the other hand, it would be interesting to see whether and how switchgrass-specific ccch genes  benefited the plants and shaped its unique plant statue and ecological fitness.

the functionality of the abovementioned pvc3h genes, particularly those orthologous to known functional rice and arabidopsis ccch genes, can be further confirmed through transgenic approaches. these pvc3hs can be used in genetic engineering or as molecular markers in marker-assisted breeding to improve switchgrass agronomic traits, e.g., stress tolerance and delayed senescence.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide study of switchgrass ccch genes determined phylogenetic classification, evolution, tissue/organ level gene expression, and potential functions of these genes. the large number of ccch genes and high percentage of them under diversifying selection reflect the recent evolution events of allotetraploid switchgrass. the clade-xivpvc3hs were highlighted in this study for their responses to different abiotic stresses at transcriptional levels and for their potential regulatory roles in stress-tolerances. manipulating the expression level of ccch genes through biotechnological approaches could be an effective way to further improve the agronomic traits of switchgrass.
