BACKGROUND
vibrio anguillarum is the causative agent of vibriosis, one of the major bacterial diseases affecting fish, bivalves, and crustaceans  <cit> . vibriosis has been a major problem for the aquaculture industry around the world. large economic losses due to this fish pathogen are sustained by the fish farming industry. annual losses of cultured fish species in japan alone exceed $ <dig> million  <cit> . vibriosis in fish is observed as a hemorrhagic septicemia. infected fish display skin discoloration and erythema around the base of the fins, vent, and mouth. necrotic lesions form in the abdominal muscle. mortalities within affected fish farm stocks range from 30–100%  <cit> .

extracellular metalloproteases are important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria including vibrio cholerae  <cit>  and vibrio vulnificus  <cit> . the empa metalloprotease genes of v. anguillarum strains nb <dig> and m93sm have been cloned and sequenced by milton et al  <cit>  and denkin and nelson  <cit> , respectively. the empa metalloprotease of v. anguillarum shares significant sequence homology with other known proteases. although the role of the empa metalloprotease is not completely understood, we showed previously that v. anguillarum empa mutants are either avirulent or attenuated for virulence in atlantic salmon depending on the route of inoculation  <cit> . it can be hypothesized that empa causes tissue damage during pathogenesis.

recently, the vibrio harveyi luxr  homologue in v. anguillarum, vant, was cloned, sequenced, and shown to be required for protease activity  <cit> . luxrvh dependent regulation of luminescence in v. harveyi occurs at the promoter of the lux operon  <cit> . while the amino acid sequence of luxrvh in v. harveyi is not similar to the luxrvf protein in v. fischeri which also regulates luminescence  <cit> , it is thought that luxrvh binds to the lux box and activates the expression of the luciferase genes. since luxrvh functions as a transcriptional activator in v. harveyi and vant is required for protease expression in v. anguillarum, we wanted to determine whether any proteins bind to the regulatory regions  immediately upstream of empa.

we have previously shown that v. anguillarum cells grow rapidly in atlantic salmon intestinal mucus  <cit>  and that empa is strongly induced when cells are incubated at high density in mucus  <cit> . further, we have demonstrated that empa transcription is rpos-dependent  <cit> . our findings also suggest that quorum sensing and undescribed autoinducer help to regulate the expression of empa in v. anguillarum  <cit> . additionally, milton et al  <cit>  previously identified a lux box-like element about  <dig> bp upstream of the translational start of empa, which we subsequently showed to span the transcriptional start site  <cit> . in this study, we examine, compare, and contrast the expression of metalloprotease encoded by empa in two strains of v. anguillarum . differences in empa expression were investigated with regards to various growth conditions, the presence or absence of dna-binding proteins, and putative regulatory proteins.

RESULTS
gel shift analysis of the empa promoter
the possibility of dna-binding proteins interacting with regulatory sequences of empa, were examined using a digoxigenin  labeled oligomer containing the lux box-like element and empa promoter region. the location of double stranded oligomer relative to the promoter and coding sequences is shown in fig.  <dig>  protein extracts from v. anguillarum m93sm and nb <dig> cells incubated in lb <dig> and nssm were mixed with the dig-labeled oligomer . nb <dig> and m93sm cells were incubated in lb <dig> and nssm for  <dig> h and protein extracts from cells at  <dig> and  <dig> h were prepared. dna binding was observed in protein extracts from nb <dig> incubated in lb <dig> and nssm  at both  <dig> and  <dig> h. a  <dig> -fold increase  in the amount of dna binding was observed by  <dig> h in extracts from nssm-grown nb <dig> cells . an additional  <dig> -fold increase in dna binding was observed when the amount of protein was increased from  <dig> μg to  <dig>  μg . although only a minor change in the amount of dna binding  was detectable by  <dig> h in nb <dig> extract from lb20-grown cells, a  <dig> -fold decrease  in free dig-labeled oligomer was observed . in addition, a  <dig> -fold decrease in free dig-labeled oligomer was detected when  <dig>  μg protein was added . specificity of protein binding to the dig-labeled oligomer was tested by competitive inhibition of binding by the addition of excess amounts of an identical unlabeled oligomer. when excess unlabeled lux box-empa promoter oligomer was added to protein extracts from lb20- and nssm-grown nb <dig> cells binding to the dig-labeled oligomer was abolished. further, the addition of unlabeled oct2a  to protein extracts did not affect the gel mobility shift of the dig-labeled oligomer caused by protein extracts from nb <dig> cells incubated either in lb <dig> or nssm. in contrast to protein extracts from nb <dig> cells grown in lb <dig> or nssm causing a gel shift, protein extracts from m93sm cells incubated in either condition did not show any binding to the dig-labeled oligomer . even when  <dig>  μg of protein was used, a band shift was not observed. in a separate experiment, protein extracts from nb <dig> cells incubated in 3m or starved in nss also caused a similar gel mobility shift for the dig-labeled oligomer . additionally, even when  <dig> μg of protein extract from exponentially growing nb <dig> cells in lb <dig> was added to the dig-labeled oligomer, a band shift was observed. further, in this gel shift experiment, m93sm protein extract was added as a negative control to the labeled dig-labeled oligomer and no shift was observed.

protease activity in lb <dig>  nssm, 3m, and nss
expression of empa in nb <dig> occurs in both lb <dig> and nssm, while m93sm exhibits empa expression only in nssm  <cit> . since a gel mobility shift was observed in nb <dig> protein extracts in all conditions of growth and during starvation, these cells were tested for protease activity in 3m and nss in addition to lb <dig> and nssm . protease activity was detected in nb <dig> cells after  <dig> and  <dig> h of incubation in nssm or lb <dig>  respectively . maximum protease activity was observed at  <dig> h for both conditions of incubation. in addition, protease activity was observed in nb <dig> cells incubated in 3m or starved in nss after  <dig> h and continued to increase during the next hour of the  <dig> h experiment. throughout the incubation, nb <dig> cells in 3m produced 3– <dig> fold greater amounts of protease activity than cells in nss. the amount of protease measured in nss at  <dig> h was only  <dig> and 17% of the amount produced in lb <dig> and nssm, respectively. in contrast, protease activity was observed in m93sm cells only when incubated in nssm . m93sm cells did not produce protease activity in any of the other conditions examined.

effects of vant mutations on protease activity and gel mobility shift
since vant of v. anguillarum nb <dig> was cloned, sequenced and shown to be required for protease activity  <cit> , vant mutants of both m93sm and nb <dig> were created by site directed mutagenesis and tested for protease activity in lb <dig> and nssm. when the mutants  were incubated in nssm for  <dig> h, a small amount of protease activity was detected  . no protease activity was observed in m93sm, m <dig>  or nb <dig> incubated in lb <dig> 

the vant mutant strains  and their parental wild-types  were also examined for vant transcription by rt-pcr . neither vant mutant produced vant transcripts. interestingly, both wild-type strains produced vant mrna in both lb <dig> and nssm.

to determine if vant was binding to the lux box-empa promoter, protein extracts from nb <dig> were tested in the gel shift assay . protein extracts from nb <dig> cells incubated in nssm and lb <dig> exhibited binding to the dig-labeled oligomer similar to that observed with protein extracts from wild-type nb <dig> cells . these data show that vant was not responsible for the gel mobility shift of the lux box – empa promoter oligomer.

discussion
it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional activator, luxrvf, in vibrio fischeri, activates expression of the lux operon via interaction with the lux box  <cit> . although there is incomplete understanding of luxrvf interaction with the lux box, good evidence is available that shows a specific lux box sequence required for efficient luxrvf binding  <cit> . luxrvh from v. harveyi and luxrvf from v. fischeri are not the same transcriptional activator proteins  <cit> . these proteins differ in their activation of the lux operon. in v. fischeri, luxrvf interacts with an acylhomoserine lactone autoinducer and then binds to the lux box to activate transcription of the lux genes  <cit> . in v. harveyi, the regulation of luminescence occurs via a phosphorelay signal transduction system, which involves luxrvh binding to the lux box independent of an autoinducer  <cit> . additionally, a central response regulator, luxo, has been shown to regulate the expression of luxr  <cit>  in v. harveyi. recently, the luxrvh homologue of v. fischeri was identified as litr  <cit> . however, it is not known if v. fischeri uses a phosphorelay cascade to control litr interaction with the lux operon.

in this study, two strains of v. anguillarum  were examined for a empa promoter region binding protein. in all conditions, incubation with nb <dig> protein extracts resulted in a gel mobility shift to the dig-labeled oligomer. in contrast, m93sm extracts did not show any protein binding to the labeled dna in any conditions tested. this was interesting because nb <dig> protease production occurs in all conditions, while m93sm protease activity is detected only when the cells are incubated in mucus. recently, vant, the luxrvh homolog in v. anguillarum, was identified by milton et al  <cit>  and shown to positively regulate empa metalloprotease and biofilm production. we created vant mutants in both m93sm and nb <dig> and tested them for vant expression, protease activity, and dna binding. these two mutants, m <dig> and nb <dig>  did not produce detectable vant mrna. however, both exhibited low levels of protease activity in mucus - about 5% and 13% of wild type activity in mucus, respectively. for nb <dig>  no protease activity in lb <dig> was observed. these results demonstrate that vant is required for protease activity in a non-mucus containing medium , confirming the result reported by milton et al  <cit> . our results also show that in nssm, vant mutants still exhibit some protease activity, but vant is required for full protease activity in both m <dig> and nb <dig> cells.

we tested a vant mutant of v. anguillarum for the possibility of vant binding to and activation of empa expression. since the v. anguillarum nb <dig> strain expresses empa during stationary phase in all conditions tested and protein extracts from these conditions show dna binding to the empa promoter region, it was hypothesized that vant binds to this region. the vant mutant, nb <dig>  was analyzed for gel shift using protein extracts from cells incubated in lb <dig> and nssm. protein extracts from nb <dig> cells incubated in each condition still caused a band shift. this result suggests that vant, the luxrvh homolog in v. anguillarum, either does not bind to the empa promoter region containing the lux box-like element or perhaps vant binds to a second protein that binds to this dna sequence. the former possibility is more likely since the gel shift observed in nb <dig> is identical to that observed in nb <dig> extracts. further, since the m93sm vant mutant, m <dig> still exhibits about 13% of the wild type protease activity in nssm and does not exhibit protein binding in the gel shift analysis, it is probable that vant does not bind to the empa promoter-lux box region. however, croxatto et al.  <cit>  demonstrated recently that purified vant protein binds to the v. anguillarum nb <dig> promoter regions for empa, vanou, and vant. examination of their data shows that vant binds more strongly to the promoters for vanou and vant  than to the empa promoter . it should be noted that in our study only  <dig> μg of total protein extract was used in the gel shift analysis. that binding to the empa promoter is still observed in vant mutants strongly suggests that an unidentified protein binds to the promoter-lux box region.

previously, we have shown that empa in v. anguillarum m93sm is positively regulated by at least two components of salmon gastrointestinal mucus  <cit> . in this study we show that nb <dig> cells exhibit protease activity under all nutritional conditions including starvation in nss when at high density, whereas m93sm only induces protease activity in mucus. rpos is required for expression of empa in both m93sm and nb <dig>  <cit> . this was demonstrated by the observation that rpos mutants of m93sm  and nb <dig>  exhibit no protease activity when cells are incubated in either lb <dig> or mucus during stationary phase. extracellular factors present in conditioned media showed both positive and negative effects on empa expression  <cit> . lb <dig> conditioned supernatants from m93sm cause a more rapid and increased production of protease activity . however, conditioned lb <dig> from the luxs mutant, m01added to wild-type cells results in a more rapid induction of protease activity, which suggests that ai- <dig> may act as a negative regulator of empa.

in this study we confirmed that vant is required for empa expression in nb <dig> when incubated in lb20; however, when nb <dig> or m93sm cells are incubated in nssm, a small percentage of protease activity remains in the vant mutants. our data support the observation by croxatto et al  <cit>  that vant positively regulates empa expression. further, the role of vant as a transcriptional activator of empa via the lux box-like element has not been established. our data show that vant does not bind to the empa promoter lux box-like region, but is required for maximum protease activity. in addition, we show that in nb <dig> an unknown protein binds to the empa promoter-lux box region that may increase protease activity in all conditions. in contrast, m93sm protein binding to this region is not observed and protease activity is detected only when cells are incubated in mucus. in conclusion, the expression of the empa virulence gene in v. anguillarum is regulated transcriptionally by the alternative σ-factor rpos  and the transcriptional activator vant . additionally, an unknown dna binding protein binds specifically to the empa promoter lux box-like region in nb <dig> cells, but not in m93sm cells. we hypothesize that this protein permits empa expression in the absence of the inducing factors in fish gastrointestinal mucus. a better understanding of how and why these two wild-type strains of v. anguillarum exhibit different levels of empa expression will further reveal how virulence genes are regulated in this fish pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
differences in empa expression between the two strains of v. anguillarum, m93sm and nb <dig>  correspond with the production of an unknown regulatory protein that binds to a  <dig> bp oligomer identical to the promoter-lux box region of empa. for nb <dig>  protein binding to the oligomer correlated with the expression of empa in all incubation conditions. however, m93sm, which expresses empa only in mucus, did not exhibit protein binding in this condition. additionally, a null mutation in vant  results in severely decreased or no empa expression, but does not abolish protein binding  to the oligomer. our data suggest that while empa expression in both v. anguillarum m93sm and nb <dig> is dependent upon rpos and vant, the two strains differ in production of an unknown protein that binds to the promoter-lux box-like region of empa. we also hypothesize that the presence of this dna binding protein permits nb <dig> cells to express empa in the absence of fish gastrointestinal mucus.
