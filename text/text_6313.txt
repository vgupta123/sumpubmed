BACKGROUND
replication of the bacterial chromosome is a complex process requiring the interaction of a variety of essential enzymes including primase, helicase, and dna polymerases i and iii  <cit> . it is hypothesized that bacteria co-regulate the expression of these unlinked genes to ensure the necessary proteins are available during chromosomal replication. to better understand these processes, the transcriptional regulation of the macromolecular synthesis operon   <cit> , which contains dnag , was studied in staphylococcus epidermidis.

the mmso was originally identified in escherichia coli where it was found to consist of three genes with seemingly divergent functions; rpsu, dnag, and rpod  <cit> . the first open reading frame , rpsu, encodes an essential s <dig> ribosomal protein whereas the second  encodes primase, an enzyme required to synthesize rna primers during dna replication. the third orf  encodes the primary sigma factor  responsible for promoter recognition by rna polymerase  <cit> . investigations of other bacteria determined that the structure and composition of the mmso was conserved in multiple gram-negative species and rpod  and dnag are linked  <cit> . the most well characterized gram-positive mmso is that of bacillus subtilis which closely resembles the e. coli mmso. the only exception is the 5' end where an uncharacterized gene, yqxd, is found instead of an rpsu ortholog  <cit> . within the b. subtilis mmso, there are seven known promoters; two σa-dependent, two σh-dependent, one σb-dependent, and two promoters for which the sigma factor involved is unknown  <cit> . since s. epidermidis is a non-spore forming bacteria, contains only four known sigma factors   <cit> , and has a divergent genetic organization upstream of dnag, we hypothesized that the transcriptional regulation of the s. epidermidis mmso would differ from b. subtilis. our study found the s. epidermidis mmso consists of four genes  and is regulated by at least three distinct promoters. in addition, it was determined that two promoters, one of which is σb-dependent, regulate siga transcription suggesting that the staphylococcal σb response is tempered by the enhancement of siga transcription. finally, functional studies demonstrated that serp <dig> was an atp/gtp binding protein.

RESULTS
genetic organization of the s. epidermidis mmso and other gram-positive bacterial mmsos
examination of the s. epidermidis rp62a  and atcc  <dig>  genomes revealed that both dnag and siga were linked as previously described, however, structural differences were also apparent in comparison with b. subtilis str.  <dig>  . the presence of potential new orfs within the s. epidermidis mmso led us to investigate the degree of conservation of the mmso region within  <dig> other gram-positive genomes, listeria monocytogenes str. 4b f <dig>  and streptococcus pyogenes mgas <dig>  . several observations were noted when comparing these genomes. first, the siga and dnag genes were linked in all four genomes suggesting the presence of an mmso. in addition, the genes surrounding the mmso  were moderately conserved between s. epidermidis, l. monocytogenes, and b. subtilis; however, in comparison, the region surrounding dnag and siga in s. pyogenes was completely divergent. it was noted that the 5' gene in the e. coli mmso, rpsu, is at most ~ <dig> kb upstream of each gram-positive mmso suggesting a linkage between rpsu, dnag, and siga in gram-positive and gram-negative species. of the genes immediately upstream of dnag, it was found that s. epidermidis does not have a yqxd orthologue as found in b. subtilis and l. monocytogenes . yqxd and lmof2365_ <dig> share 48% amino acid identity  <cit> . just upstream of dnag in s. epidermidis were two orfs, serp <dig> and serp <dig>  an ortholog of serp <dig> is found upstream of yqxd and lmof2365_ <dig> in b. subtilis  and l. monocytogenes , respectively. only b. subtilis has a serp <dig> ortholog . bioinformatic analyses of serp <dig>  annotated as a hypothetical protein, shared 59% and 47% amino acid identity with yqfl  and lmof2365_ <dig> , respectively. in addition, serp <dig>  annotated as a hypothetical protein containing a cbs domain, shared 59% amino acid identity with b. subtilis yqzb. these results suggest a strong conservation of the linkage between dnag and siga among the gram-positive genomes; however, the presence of a serp <dig> ortholog upstream of dnag in three of the four species appeared equally significant.

transcriptional analysis of the s. epidermidis mmso
a series of northern blots were performed to determine the number of transcripts and genes associated with the mmso of s. epidermidis. s. epidermidis  <dig> was grown over a 18-hour period  and aliquots were taken at two-hour intervals for rna extraction. the siga dna probe hybridized to five bands  of sizes  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>  kb ,  <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb . bands a, c-f were detected through six hours of growth  using a siga probe; however, the largest transcript  was not detected after six hours of growth. bands e and f were detected again at  <dig> hours of growth . bands c and d were variably expressed throughout the growth phase. the lack of detection of bands a, e and f in hours 8- <dig> corresponds to the shift from exponential to post-exponential phase growth . a similar banding pattern was observed when dnag was used as a probe . transcripts correlating to band a were not detected with the dnag probe after four hours of growth, whereas both mrnas correlating to bands e and f were again detected in post-exponential growth . however, bands c and d  were not detected using dnag as a probe, suggesting that both of these transcripts were comprised of siga alone. a series of rt-pcr reactions were performed to determine the 5' and 3' orf's encompassed within the s. epidermidis mmso . appropriately sized products were amplified from s. epidermidis mrna isolated during exponential phase when the following primer pairs were used:  <dig> and 673;  <dig> and 760; and  <dig> and  <dig> . however, no amplicon was detected using primers 674/ <dig> and 673/ <dig>  these data demonstrated siga comprised the 3' end gene of the s. epidermidis mmso whereas serp <dig> was located at the 5' end.

to evaluate the transcriptional regulation of the 5' genes in the mmso during s. epidermidis growth, serp <dig> and serp <dig> were used as probes in northern blot analyses . both of these probes hybridized to mrna in a similar manner and identified four bands . bands a, e, and f were  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb in size, respectively, and corresponded to the same bands of similar size when both siga and dnag were used as probes . a unique  <dig>  kb band  was detected with both probes. since the length of serp <dig> and serp <dig> combined is  <dig> bp, these data suggested that both serp <dig> and serp <dig> were encoded on one mrna transcript. the transcripts associated with bands a and b were detected only in aliquots taken during the exponential growth phase.

collectively, these data suggested the following: 1) the  <dig>  kb  transcript encompasses all four orf's  and this transcript is detectable only when the cells are in exponential phase; 2) siga is encoded within two unique transcripts  that are highly expressed throughout the growth phase ; 3) serp <dig> and serp <dig> are encoded on a separate transcript  that is expressed only in exponential phase; and 4) based on the size of transcripts e and f , the size of the entire mmso operon , and the fact that all four probes hybridized to bands e and f, we could not determine the most probable location of these transcripts.

identification of transcriptional start sites
primer extension was performed to confirm the results of the northern blot analyses and to detect the transcriptional start site of the predicted transcripts shown in figure 3c. using mrna collected after two hours of growth and primers  <dig> and  <dig> , it was determined that the + <dig> site of transcript a was an adenine  <dig> bp upstream from the serp <dig> orf  and was labeled as p <dig> in figure 5d. no other additional transcript was detected in this 5' region of the mmso suggesting that transcript b represents a prematurely terminated transcript a. next, rna isolated from aliquots taken during post-exponential phase  was used to determine the + <dig> sites of transcripts c and d proximal to siga. using primers  <dig> and  <dig> , two separate transcripts were identified. one + <dig> site  corresponded to a thymine  <dig> bp upstream from the siga start codon , while the second + <dig> site  originated at a thymine  <dig> bp upstream of siga .

since the location of the + <dig> sites for transcripts e and f within the mmso could not be predicted by northern blot analysis, several different primers were used in primer extension and race analysis. although five primers were tested in primer extension analysis  and four primers  were utilized in 5' race analysis with rna isolated from both exponential and stationary phase cultures, the + <dig> transcriptional start sites for the transcripts that corresponded to bands e or f could not be determined. to investigate whether transcripts e and f represented anti-sense rna , both sense and anti-sense siga rna probes were constructed. using rna isolated at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, northern blot analyses demonstrated that the siga anti-sense rna probe detected the same transcripts as the dna probe including transcripts a, b, c, d, e, and f . however, the sense siga rna probe only hybridized weakly to the 16s and 23s rrna bands . therefore, since all four probes  did not consistently detect transcripts e and f throughout the growth phase , transcripts e and f most likely represent processed or degraded forms of transcript a .

transcription of siga occurs from both σa- and σb-dependent promoters
previous studies of the e. coli mmso have shown the presence of a heat shock inducible promoter located directly upstream of the siga orf inside of the dnag coding sequence  <cit> . a similar promoter has been identified within the b. subtilis mmso  <cit> . to determine whether transcripts in the s. epidermidis mmso originated from a σb promoter, rna extracts from both wild type  <dig> and  <dig> sigb::dhfr were probed with siga and serp <dig>  the northern analysis demonstrated no difference between  <dig> and  <dig> sigb::dhfr rna when probed with serp <dig> . however, transcript d was not detected in the  <dig> sigb::dhfr rna when siga was used as a probe  suggesting siga, the gene encoding the primary sigma factor used in staphylococci, is also transcribed from a σbpromoter. to confirm this northern blot result, a series of primer extension reactions were performed. results showed that a p <dig> + <dig> site was not detected in rna isolated from  <dig> sigb::dhfr , whereas the p <dig> + <dig> site was detected in both  <dig> and  <dig> sigb::dhfr . putative - <dig> and - <dig> regions and the transcriptional start site of each promoter p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> are shown in figures 5e, f and 5g. the σb-consensus sequence gtttww-12-15-gggwaw was used to identify the putative σb-p <dig> promoter sequence  <cit> .

expression of serp <dig> in s. epidermidis 1457
since serp <dig> was contained within the s. epidermidis mmso and conserved in three of the four gram-positive genomes analyzed, expression and functional studies were performed. anti-serp <dig> antibody was used in western blot studies to determine if serp <dig> was maximally produced during exponential growth as predicted by transcriptional analysis. total protein samples from s. epidermidis  <dig> were taken every two hours from 2- <dig> hours of growth. these data demonstrated that serp <dig> was expressed at low levels at  <dig> hours and increased to the maximum level at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, and began to decrease at  <dig> hours with no serp <dig> being detected at the  <dig> or  <dig> hour time point . these data demonstrate that serp <dig> transcript was translated, and that serp <dig> was only expressed in the exponential phase of growth as predicted by the previous northern blot analyses.

serp <dig> is an atp/gtp binding protein
the potential functional role of serp <dig> in s. epidermidis was further investigated as bioinformatic analyses indicated that serp <dig> shared 54% amino acid identity with b. thuringiensis atcc  <dig> rbth_ <dig>  a protein annotated as having an atp/gtp binding motif. recombinant serp <dig> was tested for the ability to bind atp or gtp, and found both nucleotide analogs were able to bind serp <dig> . adding  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μm of unlabeled atp to the reaction mixture evaluated the specificity of atp binding to recombinant serp <dig>  the addition of  <dig> μm unlabeled atp decreased the binding of labeled atp to serp <dig>  while no band was detected when  <dig> μm unlabeled atp was added . these data suggest that the unlabeled atp was able to compete for the same binding site within serp <dig>  a similar pattern was observed when gtp binding reactions were performed, however, less gtp was bound by serp <dig> as compared to atp. a coomassie blue stained gel was loaded with an equivalent amount of protein used in the experiment and is shown as a loading control . these results indicate that serp <dig> has an ability to bind both atp and gtp but has a higher affinity for atp.

discussion
s. epidermidis is a component of the normal skin flora of humans and yet is a significant cause of catheter and other biomaterial-related infections. this opportunistic pathogen is typically resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics. new targets, including those factors involved in dna replication , are needed for development of next generation antimicrobials. in the studies described here, s. epidermidis was used as a model organism to ascertain the transcriptional regulation of genes pertinent to dna replication. since it had not been previously described, it was necessary to characterize in detail the transcriptional regulation of the mmso  in s. epidermidis.

several important differences were identified between the mmso of s. epidermidis and the previously well characterized b. subtilis mmso  <cit> . the s. epidermidis mmso contained two genes not previously recognized as part of a mmso; serp <dig> and serp <dig>  both genes encode for proteins with unknown functions. bioinformatic analysis of the amino acid sequence of serp <dig> demonstrated that it possessed an atp or atp-derivative binding motif while serp <dig> contained a cbs  domain, a motif frequently identified in human proteins  <cit> . second, the b. subtilis mmso is known to have  <dig> distinct transcription initiation sites, whereas only three transcriptional start sites and six transcripts were detected in the s. epidermidis mmso  <cit> . although speculative, the greater complexity of the transcriptional regulation of the mmso in b. subtilis in comparison to s. epidermidis may be due to the regulation of the sporulation cascade  <cit> . one transcription initiation site was identified at the 5' end of the mmso and two were identified at the 3' end initiating siga transcription. it is probable that both transcripts a and b originate from the same transcription initiation site at the 5' end of the mmso and that transcript b is prematurely terminated at the 3' end of serp <dig> , especially since a rho-independent termination site exists between rpsu and dnag in a large number of gram-negative mmsos  <cit> . western blot analysis demonstrated that serp <dig> was maximally detected in exponential phase growth, in agreement with the transcriptional analysis of the serp <dig> expression.

our study found that the primary sigma factor of s. epidermidis, siga,  <cit>  is transcribed from two promoters, one of which is σb-dependent. currently, the model for bacterial sigma factor exchange does not account for transcriptional differences between each sigma factor. the model only examines competition between the free sigma factor pool for rna polymerase  <cit> . therefore, the sigma factor pool that is in excess will bind to rna polymerase resulting in the transcription of a subset of genes  <cit> . however, within b. subtilis, σb has a 60-fold lower affinity for rna polymerase than σa suggesting other layers of regulation may exist to ensure sigma factor exchange  <cit> . therefore, transcriptional regulation of sigma factor genes may act as a second layer of sigma factor regulation which functions to fine-tune the free sigma factor pool, ultimately affecting sigma factor exchange with rna polymerase. we hypothesize that the presence of a σb-dependent promoter upstream of siga ensures that relevant concentrations of σa are present under all metabolic conditions to interact with rna polymerase, even under conditions of cellular stress . in addition, σb regulation of siga may also be important for the return of the bacterium from a stress response to a normal transcriptional pattern. in support of this concept, recent studies in synechocystis pcc <dig> demonstrated that induction of one sigma factor altered the transcription of the remaining sigma factors suggesting a transcriptional cross-talk within the sigma factor system  <cit> .

in addition to transcripts a , b , c  and d , two transcripts e and f were detected using all four probes. however, a transcriptional initiation site for transcripts e and f was not identified using two separate methodologies, specifically primer extension and 5' race. therefore, we propose that transcripts e and f are processed/degraded products of the larger  <dig>  kb transcript a. it is known that the mmso of e. coli is selectively cleaved by rnasee  <cit> ; providing additional evidence that transcripts e and f could represent a regulated, processed form of transcript a. it is possible, although their sizes are indistinguishable, that transcripts e and f detected in exponential phase are unique from that detected in late exponential or stationary phase . however, a potential + <dig> site for transcripts e and f was not detected using total rna isolated from both exponential and stationary phase cultures. clearly, further experimentation is needed to determine the origin and function of transcripts e and f.

the conservation of serp <dig> orthologs in three gram-positive species led us to investigate the potential functional role of serp <dig>  atp and gtp binding assays showed that serp <dig> was capable of binding atp and gtp. studies of streptomyces nrdr have shown that the binding of atp or datp into a pocket within the protein affect its ability to bind and act as a transcriptional regulator of the ribonucleotide reductases genes  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether the ability of serp <dig> to bind atp or gtp functions in regulating transcription of the mmso during exponential growth.

serp <dig> may also play a pivotal role in sensing the energy status of the cell and regulation of replication proteins within s. epidermidis. cbs domains are necessary for the energy sensing mechanism in some proteins such as amp-activated protein kinase   <cit> . recent data from studies in bacteria have demonstrated that the cbs domain within yrbh of yersinia pestis negatively regulates the organisms ability to produce biofilm by responding to atp concentrations within the cell  <cit> . in addition, a cbs domain within lactococcus lactis opua is involved in sensing ionic strength  <cit> . it follows that a protein with the ability to sense environmental stress or the energy status of the cell could be a significant regulator of dna replication. our laboratory is currently investigating whether serp <dig> and serp <dig> are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the mmso and/or other replication genes.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrated that the s. epidermidis mmso contains two previously unidentified orfs  and that siga transcription is regulated by a σβ promoter. the transcriptional regulation of siga by σb suggests that the staphylococcal σb regulon is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. further assays demonstrated that serp <dig> is an atp/gtp binding protein; its connection to other functions found within genes encoded by the mmso is unknown. finally, although siga was actively transcribed in both the exponential and post-exponential phases of growth, serp <dig>  serp <dig> and dnag were most transcriptionally active during exponential growth. we are currently testing the hypothesis that genes involved in dna replication, including the mmso, are co-regulated in the exponential growth phase through a common regulator or metabolite.
