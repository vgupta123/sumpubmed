BACKGROUND
the main glycogen stores are confined to skeletal muscle and liver, although glycogen metabolizing machinery is present in many cell types. in the cell, glycogen is associated with protein complexes  <cit>  that include glycogen-metabolizing enzymes such as the synthesizing enzyme gs, the hydrolyzing enzyme glycogen phosphorylase , glycogenin, branching enzyme and debranching enzyme, and regulatory proteins, such as the protein phosphatase  <dig>  that directs the metabolism of the glycogen particle. these glycogen and protein complexes, in the form of particles or granules, were designated glycosomes  <cit> .

pp <dig> is the only known serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates gs and gp and changes its activation state  <cit> . the pp <dig> catalytic subunit  is targeted to the glycogen particles by glycogen-associated regulatory subunits, pp1-gtss. pp1-gtss constitute a family of proteins including ppp1r3a, ppp1r3b, ppp1r3c, ppp1r3d and ppp1r3e with low amino acid identity, which is characterized by its conserved pp1c binding motif   <cit> , a glycogen-binding domain  <cit>  and a pp1-substrate binding domain  <cit> . pp1-gtss display tissue- and specie-specific expression. in human skeletal muscle, several members of the pp1-gts gene family are expressed: the muscle-specific ppp1r3a/gm/pp1g/rgl  <cit> ; ppp1r3c/ptg/ppp1r <dig>  <cit>  and ppp1r3b/gl  <cit> , which are expressed mostly in muscle and liver; the relatively widespread isoform ppp1r3d/ppp1r <dig>  <cit> ; and ppp1r3e, most abundant in skeletal muscle and heart tissue in humans  <cit> . in contrast, in rodent skeletal muscle, the ppp1r3b  <cit>  and ppp1r3e  <cit>  genes are not significantly expressed.

the human ppp1r <dig> subunit was identified by armstrong et al.  <cit>  in the search for sequences related to the rat gl and human ppp1r <dig> proteins in an expressed sequence tag database. these authors demonstrated that the ppp1r <dig> protein specifically binds to purified pp <dig> and is associated with glycogen in the glycogen-sarcovesicle fraction from rabbit skeletal muscle. they detected ppp1r <dig> transcripts in all human tissues examined including brain, placenta, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas. the highest levels were found in skeletal muscle and heart. in a later study, the ppp1r <dig> gene transcript was detected in several human cancer cell lines, including small cell and non-small cell lung cancers, colorectal, gastric and ovarian cancers, and adult normal lung, colorectal and ovarian tissues, but not normal gastric tissue  <cit> . only one previous study has demonstrated a metabolic functional role of ppp1r <dig> in stimulating glycogen accumulation in chinese hamster ovary cells stably transformed with the insulin receptor  <cit> .

in contrast, the metabolic control role of gm and ptg in the muscle glycogen metabolism has been amply described. pp1g/rgl/gm regulates basal gs and gp activity ratio in skeletal muscle, as observed in gm/rgl knockout mice  <cit>  and is essential for gs activation in response to exercise  <cit> , but not necessary for activation of gs by insulin  <cit> . in cultured human myotubes, gm also regulates both gs and gp activities and the effect of activating gs is enhanced in glucose/glycogen-depleted cells  <cit> . ptg regulates basal gs activation, is not required for insulin stimulation of gs and does not affect gp activity in skeletal muscle of mice bearing a heterozygous deletion of the ptg gene  <cit> . in cultured human myotubes, ptg has a powerful activating effect on gs, which is not glucose-dependent, and on glycogenesis; whereas it does not affect gp activity  <cit> . in this cell system, the effects of gl have also been reported, i.e. that gl activates gs, regardless of glucose, and glycogenesis more powerfully than gm, and does not affect the gp activation state  <cit> .

even though pp1-gtss are presumed to contribute to organizing the glycogen particle  <cit> , the ability to target glycogen particles to a specific subcellular location has only been suggested for gm/rgl, as it contains a sarcoplasmic reticulum  binding domain  <cit>  and is found associated with non-junctional sr membranes, forming a complex with gs and pp1c in rabbit skeletal muscle  <cit> .

here we applied metabolic and glycogen cytochemical techniques to determine the glycogenic effect of ppp1r6; and used transmission electron microscopy to define the distribution and morphology of ppp1r6-formed glycogen particles in cultured skeletal muscle cells, in comparison with ptg and gm. we also provide information about the subcellular location of the ppp1r <dig> protein in cultured myotubes.

methods
muscle samples and culture
muscle samples and myogenic cells came from a cryopreserved collection of human skeletal muscle biopsies described in  <cit>  and obtained with written approval from the ethics committee of the hospital sant joan de déu  according to spanish legislation at that time. myotubes were derived from confluent myoblast cultures; immediately after the start of myoblast fusion, dmem/m- <dig> medium  with 10% fbs ,  <dig> μg/ml insulin,  <dig> mm glutamine,  <dig> ng/ml fibroblast growth factor and  <dig> ng/ml epidermal growth factor was replaced by dmem/m- <dig> medium  with 10% fbs and  <dig> μg/ml insulin, to further stimulate differentiation.

mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts and  <dig> cells were grown in dmem with 10% fbs. in confluent cultures, c2c <dig> cell fusion was stimulated by incubation in dmem medium with 10% hs . the c2c12-mtrfp cell line stably expressing the mitochondrial matrix-targeted  red fluorescent protein   <cit> , kindly provided by dr. a. zorzano , was cultured as the c2c <dig> cell line.

rna extraction, reverse transcription  and real-time pcr
total rna was extracted from tissue samples as described elsewhere  <cit> . total rna from cultured cells was extracted with the rneasy minikit . extracts were homogenized with a polytron . a  <dig>  μg portion of total rna was retrotranscribed with taqman rt reagents from applied biosystems  using random hexamers. real-time pcr was performed in the abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system or lightcycler  <dig> sw  <dig>  with the taqman universal pcr master mix or lightcycler  <dig> probes master, respectively, and probes for human ppp1r3d and rabbit ppp1r3a genes from applied biosystems. β2-microglobulin or 18s rrna gene was used as the endogenous control to normalize the threshold cycle  or crossing point  for each probe assay. relative gene expression was calculated as 2-Δct and gene fold change was calculated by the 2-ΔΔct or 2-ΔΔcp method. mean values ± sem are shown.

transduction with recombinant adenoviruses
myotubes were used,  <dig> days after differentiation-induction for cultured human myotubes; or  <dig> days after, for c2c <dig> myotubes. forty-eight hours before the experiments, human myotubes were depleted of insulin; and  <dig> h before, they were depleted of fbs. c2c <dig> cells were depleted of hs,  <dig> h before the experiments. myotubes were transduced with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of  <dig> for  <dig> h  or  <dig> h . the ad-gfp adenovirus encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of the cmv cytomegalovirus promoter, or the adenovirus ad-lacz, encoding the e. coli ß-galactosidase gene with a nuclear location signal  <cit> , were used as controls. an adenovirus containing the cdna of human ppp1r3d downstream of the cmv promoter was prepared. to do this, plasmid irakp961m1391q <dig> from rzpd , containing the cdna of human ppp1r3d inserted into the pbluescriptr vector, was digested with xhoi and bglii to elicit the ppp1r3d cdna band, which was ligated into the litmus 28i vector  cut with the same restriction enzymes. then, ppp1r3d cdna was excised with xbai and sali and ligated into the padcmvicpa vector  cut with the same restriction enzymes. five μg of resulting plasmid were cotransfected with  <dig> μg of pjm <dig> into  <dig> cells to generate the adenoviral construct ad-r <dig>  <cit> . ad-gm, encoding rabbit gm, and ad-ptg, encoding mouse ptg are described in  <cit> . ad-mgp encoding rabbit muscle gp is described in  <cit> .

enzyme activities and glycogen
to measure gs and gp activities,  <dig> μl of homogenization buffer consisting of  <dig> mm tris/hcl   <dig> mm kf,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm sucrose,  <dig> mm 2-mercaptoethanol,  <dig> μg/l leupeptin,  <dig> mm benzamidine and  <dig> mm pmsf was used in order to scrape the cell monolayers off the frozen plates prior to sonication. the resulting homogenates were used for the determination of enzyme activities. gp activity was determined by the incorporation of glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen in the absence or presence of the allosteric activator amp   <cit> . gs activity was measured in the absence or presence of  <dig> mm glucose 6-phosphate as described in  <cit> . an aliquot of the homogenates was used to measure protein concentration with the bio-rad protein assay .

to assess glycogen synthesis, cells were incubated with  <dig> mm glucose . to isolate glycogen, cell monolayers were scraped into  <dig> μl of 30% koh and homogenates were boiled for  <dig> min. an aliquot of the homogenates was used to measure protein concentration with the pierce bca protein assay kit . homogenates were spotted onto whatman  <dig> mm paper; and glycogen was precipitated by immersing the papers in ice-cold 66% ethanol. when appropriate, radioactivity in dried papers was counted in a beta-radiation counter or papers were incubated in  <dig>  m acetate buffer  with  <dig> units/ml alpha-amyloglucosidase  for  <dig> min at 37°c to hydrolyze glycogen. in the latter, glucose released was measured enzymatically with the glucose kit from biosystems .

glycogen was stained cytochemically with the periodic acid/salicyloyl hydrazide  method. briefly, c2c <dig> cells grown on coverslips were fixed with methanol at -20°c for  <dig> min. after rinsing three times with pbs and once with distilled water, half the samples were incubated with  <dig> % alpha-amylase  for  <dig> min at 30°c and the other half were not. then, glycogen was stained with pa-sh as described in  <cit> , except that they were not dehydrated and cleared in xylol. samples were mounted with vectashield  and analyzed with a leica tcs sp <dig> confocal microscope.

transmission electron microscopy
cells cultured on  <dig> cm-diameter dishes were fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate buffer   for  <dig> h and gently rocked at room temperature. cell monolayers were scraped into  <dig> ml of pb. then, they were washed with the same buffer and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer at 4°c for  <dig> h. the samples were dehydrated in acetone, infiltrated with epon resin for  <dig> days, embedded in the same resin and polymerized at 60°c for  <dig> h. ultrathin sections were obtained using a leica ultracut uct ultramicrotome and mounted on formvar-coated copper grids. they were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water and lead citrate. then, sections were examined by a jem- <dig> electron microscope . the diameter and number of glycogen particles were measured by analysis software .

western blotting
aliquots of myotube or  <dig> cell extracts prepared for enzyme activity measurement were added with loading buffer consisting of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm dithiothreitol, 2% sds,  <dig> % bromophenol blue and 10% glycerol. c2c <dig> and  <dig> cell extracts were prepared by scraping cell monolayers from  <dig> cm-diameter dishes into  <dig> μ <dig> of homogenization buffer consisting of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm pmsf,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig> mm na3vo <dig>   <dig> μg/μl benzamidine,  <dig> μg/μl leupeptin, 1% nonidet p <dig> and  <dig> mm dithiothreitol. lysates were then gently rocked for  <dig> min at 4°c. an aliquot of the total cell extracts was used to measure protein concentration with the pierce bca protein assay kit. protein was resolved by sds/10%-page, and immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against human pp1α, human ppp1r <dig> or mouse ptg , muscle gs or liver/muscle phospho-gs  , gfp  or human ppp1r3a .

fusion construct r6-egfp
a construct containing human ppp1r <dig> with an egfp tag at the c terminus was prepared. to do this, a  <dig> pb fragment of the ppp1r <dig> cdna was isolated from clone irakp961m1391q <dig> by performing pcr with pfu dna polymerase. the sequences 5'ccgcggtaccgttccgatgaagtggatccagctctcttc3'and 5'agagaagcttatgtccagaggcccgagctcc3' were used, as downstream and upstream oligonucleotides respectively. amplification conditions were  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at 65°c and  <dig> min at 72°c. a final extension was carried out at 72°c for  <dig> min. pcr products were purified by 1% agarose gel. the pcr-amplified fragment was 3' a-tailed by incubation with taq dna polymerase in a reaction mixture containing mgcl <dig> and datp, for  <dig> min at 70°c, and then cloned into the pgem-t vector  to generate pgem-t-r <dig>  finally, pr6-egfp was constructed by cloning the hindiii-kpni ppp1r <dig> cdna excised band from pgem-t-r <dig> into the dephosphorylated pegfp-n <dig> vector digested with the same restriction enzymes.

to cytolocate the r6-egfp construct with the mitochondrial network, we used c2c <dig> mtrfp cells. cells grown on coverslips were transfected with  <dig> μg of pr6-egfp with the aid of genejuice  and at  <dig> h post-transfection were fixed for  <dig> min with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs. to cytolocate the r6-egfp construct with the golgi complex, c2c <dig> cells were cotransfected with  <dig> μg pr6-egfp and  <dig> μg prfp1-n1-galt construct, which encodes rfp with the golgi targeting domain of β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase   <cit>  . pegfp-n <dig>  was used to express egfp. cell preparations were mounted with vectashield or prolong gold  and analyzed with a leica tcs sp <dig> confocal microscope.

statistical analysis
all data are given as means ± sem, and the significance of the difference was analyzed by the student's t test. values were considered significant at p <  <dig> . results for gene expression  were examined with rest .

RESULTS
relative expression of the ppp1r <dig> gene in human cultured myotubes and skeletal muscle tissue
the mrna levels of ppp1r <dig> were analyzed in human skeletal muscle biopsy samples and in myotubes isolated from biopsies. in muscle biopsies, relative ppp1r <dig> mrna levels  were lower than levels of the β2-microglobulin control gene . ppp1r <dig> gene expression in cultured myotubes  was  <dig>  times less  than in the biopsy tissue samples. in cultured myotubes, no differences were observed in ppp1r <dig> gene expression between cells cultured with glucose or  <dig> h glucose-deprived cells .

effect of ppp1r <dig> overexpression on gs and gp activities
cultured human myotubes were treated with the ad-r <dig> adenovirus to overexpress human ppp1r <dig>  human ppp1r <dig> transcript levels were increased by a 2-ΔΔcp factor of  <dig> ±  <dig>  in ad-r6-treated cells, as assessed by rt and real-time pcr, compared to cells treated with the ad-gfp virus and relative to the 18s rrna control gene. in an immunoblot analysis the antibody against human ppp1r <dig> protein detected a band in ad-r6-treated cells of about  <dig> kda , which was not shown in cells treated with the ad-gfp virus, presumably due to a much lower ppp1r <dig> protein content.

the activity of the active form of gs in cell extracts increased  <dig> times more in ppp1r6-overexpressing cells than in cells treated with ad-gfp, whereas total gs activity was unchanged . in contrast, no effects of ppp1r <dig> overexpression were observed on gp activity, either the active form or total activity . in the cultured myotubes the brain and liver isoforms of gp are greater contributors to gp activity, than the muscle gp isoform, as shown elsewhere  <cit> , due to the drop in pygm expression  <cit> . thus, we tested whether ppp1r <dig> affected the activity of the muscle isoform of gp activity by transducing cells with an adenovirus encoding the muscle isoform of gp . in ad-mgp-treated cells, the activity of the active form of gp and total gp activity increased  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively; neither of them was affected by ppp1r <dig> delivery .

differential regulating effects of ppp1r <dig>  ptg and gm on gs and glycogen synthesis
we further investigated the activating effect of ppp1r <dig> on gs and the impact on glycogen accumulation versus the pp1-gtss, ptg and gm. thus, cultured muscle cells were transduced with ad-ptg virus and ptg expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis showing an immunoreactive protein band  not detected in ad-gfp-transduced cells, as in  <cit>  . gm overexpression was achieved by transduction with the ad-gm virus, which increased the mrna level of rabbit gm by a factor of  <dig> ±  <dig>  over cells treated with ad-gfp and relative to the 18s rrna control gene, as assessed by rt real-time pcr. immunoblot analysis showed an immunoreactive protein band  not detected in ad-gfp-transduced cells, as in  <cit>  .

we analyzed the phospho-gs , total muscle gs and pp1α protein content in cell extracts . the phospho-gs  protein level was slightly reduced  by ppp1r <dig> overexpression, compared to the phosphorylation degree in ad-gfp-treated cells, whereas ptg caused a striking reduction  and gm caused a reduction that did not reach statistical significance. in accordance with these observations, an immunoblot analysis of muscle gs protein showed a downward shift in the electrophoretic mobility, indicating dephosphorylation of the enzyme, in response to ptg and ppp1r <dig>  total muscle gs protein content was increased by the pp1-gtss in the order of magnitude: ptg > ppp1r <dig> > gm. in consequence, the phospho-gs/total muscle gs protein ratio was significantly reduced by the three pp1-gtss . finally, the total protein content of pp1α, whose transcript in human tissues is most abundant in skeletal muscle and heart  <cit> , was also increased by ptg, ppp1r <dig> and gm in the same order of magnitude as total muscle gs protein was.

next we examined the glucose-dependence of activating effects on gs activity of the three pp1-gtss . delivery of ppp1r <dig> enhanced gs activity ratio in both glucose-replete  and -depleted  cells versus ad-gfp-cells, although the effect was stronger under glucose depletion. similar glucose dependence was observed for gm in accordance with our previous data  <cit> : 17% versus 44% in glucose-replete and -depleted cells, respectively. in contrast, ptg strongly activated gs, irrespective of glucose presence  or absence , as we showed elsewhere  <cit> .

the effect of ppp1r <dig> on glycogen synthesis rate was estimated by the incorporation of radioactively labeled glucose into glycogen after a period of glucose deprivation. a time-course study showed that, in cells treated with the control ad-gfp virus, glucose incorporation was steady over time, but that in cells overexpressing ppp1r <dig> there was progressive enhancement of glucose deposition into glycogen during the first  <dig> h, whereas at  <dig> h the increase was smaller . glycogen content, as assessed after koh-extraction, ethanol precipitation, hydrolysis with alpha-amyloglucosidase and quantification of released glucose, was increased by ppp1r <dig> overexpression   much less than glycogen accumulated in response to ptg overexpression , but more than it was by gm overexpression .

glycogen was then revealed cytochemically as blue fluorescent pa-sh stained material in fluorescence microscopy . in ppp1r6-overexpressing cells, diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed at a much higher intensity than in cells transduced with the control virus ad-lacz. fluorescent intensity was, however, much higher in cells transduced with ad-ptg, whereas a fainter signal was detected in cells transduced with ad-gm. the pa-sh fluorescently stained material was drastically removed by digestion with alpha-amylase in all pp1-gts-cells, indicating that it was due to glycogen presence.

glycogen granules were examined in myotube sections by transmission electron microscopy . in control ad-gfp-cells, glycogen was revealed as spherical dense particles  scattered through the cytosol . the number of particles counted in control cells was  <dig> ±  <dig> particles/μm <dig>  the mean diameter of particles was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and the majority of particles were within  <dig> to  <dig> nm although some of them reached more than  <dig> nm, as shown in figure  <dig>  in ppp1r6-overexpressing cells, there were many more dense round particles , whose mean diameter  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm  was smaller, while the range was from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. these ppp1r6-derived particles appeared as membrane-, vesicle- or organelle-associated granules. in ptg-cells a marked increment in the number of particles was also seen , but particles had a much larger diameter of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm  and sizes ranged from higher than  <dig> to more than  <dig> nm. these were located in the cytosol in large areas filled with glycogen particles, which appeared devoid of organelles and not surrounded by a membrane. finally, gm-overexpression caused a smaller rise in the number of glycogen particles , which were concentrated in clusters close to certain organelles, notably the endoplasmic reticulum, and the subsarcolemma. the average size of gm-derived glycogen granules was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and diameters ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nm.

intracellular location of the fusion protein r6-egfp
we analyzed by computational methods the possible intracellular location of ppp1r <dig>  the hum-mploc  <cit>  server that predicts subcellular location at multiple locations predicted golgi membrane location for ppp1r <dig>  while the golgi predictor  <cit>  server implemented for type ii transmembrane proteins gave a  <dig>  index  for golgi location. however, the targetp  <dig>   <cit>  server, which also predicts the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins, gave a  <dig>  probability that the sequence contains a mitochondrial targeting peptide, while the mitoprotii server  <cit> , which predicts mitochondrially-imported proteins, gave a  <dig>  probability that human ppp1r <dig> protein would be transported to mitochondria.

then, we constructed a fusion protein of ppp1r <dig> with a c-terminal egfp flag . expression of the fusion protein and its glycogenic activity was confirmed after transfection of the plasmid encoding r6-egfp into  <dig> cells. immunoblot analysis with anti-ppp1r <dig> antibody showed a band of about  <dig> kda molecular weight, higher than the endogenous ppp1r <dig>  in cells transfected with r6-egfp and not in those transfected with egfp . a band of this same size was also recognized by the anti-gfp antibody in r6-egfp cells, whereas a band of about  <dig> kda was revealed in egfp-cells . in  <dig> cells expressing the r6-egfp construct glycogen synthesis  was higher  than in egfp-cells .

to assess whether ppp1r <dig> was located at the golgi complex, we cotransfected r6-egfp and the golgi marker, rfp1-n1-galt, into c2c <dig> myoblasts incubated with and without glucose. as shown in figure 7b, in glucose-replete cells, r6-egfp appeared throughout the cytosol with a diffuse pattern and no colocation with rfp1-n1-galt was found. in glucose-depleted cells, r6-egfp showed a similar cytosol pattern plus a punctuated pattern clustered around the nucleus that was colocated with the golgi marker. the golgi marker rfp1-n1-galt displayed a compact structure in the perinuclear region mainly covering one of the nucleus poles in glucose-replete cells and appeared in punctuate structures surrounding the nucleus in glucose-depleted cells, according to the fact that atp depletion induces the golgi apparatus disassembly  <cit> . to examine whether ppp1r <dig> was located at the mitochondria, r6-egfp was delivered to c2c <dig> mtrfp myoblasts, which express a mitochondrial matrix-targeted rfp . no colocation of r6-egfp was observed with mt-rfp either in glucose-replete or -depleted cells. as a control, we transfected c2c <dig> and c2c <dig> mtrfp myoblasts with a plasmid encoding egfp and we observed that this protein was located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of glucose-replete or -depleted cells and that it was not colocated with either the mitochondrial matrix-targeted or golgi-targeted rfp .

discussion
ppp1r <dig> was originally described as a glycogen-associated pp <dig> regulatory subunit with wide tissue expression and most common in humans in skeletal muscle and heart  <cit> . here we report the lower expression of the ppp1r <dig> gene in human cultured myotubes than in skeletal muscle tissue. in this regard, ppp1r <dig> resembles ppp1r3c and differs from the ppp1r3b gene, whose expression is maintained in culture, and also from the muscle-specific ppp1r3a gene, whose expression is almost suppressed  <cit> . therefore, on the basis of our data from this and the earlier study  <cit> , the relative differential gene expression is ppp1r3c > ppp1r3a > ppp1r <dig> > ppp1r3b in human skeletal muscle tissue and ppp1r3c > ppp1r3b > ppp1r <dig> > ppp1r3a in cultured human myotubes.

in cultured myotubes, ppp1r <dig> activated gs and reduced its phosphorylation at ser-641/ <dig>  also referred to as site 3a, in a less powerful manner than ptg, but stronger than gm. gs may be phosphorylated at nine or more sites  <cit> , but the ser-641/ <dig> site is crucial for the regulation of gs activity and is extensively regulated by various effectors  <cit> . the selectivity of pp <dig> for the different sites of gs phosphorylation has not been established, but it has been proposed that pp1-gtss may confer such selectivity  <cit> . our data provide evidence that the degree of dephosphorylation of the ser-641/ <dig> site achieved in response to ppp1r <dig>  ptg or gm is tightly associated with that of gs activation, thereby suggesting a similar strong control of enzyme activity through the modulation of the phosphorylation of this site by these pp1-gtss. the activating effect of ppp1r <dig> on gs was enhanced by glucose/glycogen depletion, as also observed for gm  <cit>  but not ptg  <cit> . in fact, glycogen content is a strong regulator of gs and high glycogen content impairs insulin-stimulated activation of this enzyme, as reviewed in  <cit> . ppp1r <dig> did not exert any effect on the cultured myotube gp activity, either the endogenously expressed isoforms, which are predominantly the brain  and liver  isoforms  <cit> , or the overexpressed muscle  isoform. like ppp1r <dig>  neither does ptg affect endogenous myotube gp activity  <cit> , whereas gm inactivates gp  <cit> . as ppp1r <dig> markedly activated gs in myotubes, it exerted a potent glycogenic effect. this was seen by the increases in the rate of glycogen synthesis; by an increase in the net glycogen content, as quantified after koh extraction and ethanol precipitation; and cytochemically, by an increase in the glycogen stained as blue fluorescent pa-sh material.

glycogen accumulation in response to ppp1r <dig> was less than that achieved with ptg but higher than with gm. cellular glycogen is complexed with proteins, including glycogen metabolizing enzymes, pp <dig> and pp1-gtss  <cit> , in the form of particles or granules, also named glycosomes  <cit> . the morphology of these granules was originally defined by drochmans  <cit>  as α-, β- and γ-types. the α particles, commonly found in mammalian liver, are agglomerates of β-particles, have a rosette appearance and large diameters  <cit> , in the order of  <dig> nm  <cit> . single β-particles are found in most normal tissues, including skeletal muscle  <cit> , have a spheroid shape and diameters ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. the γ-particles are about  <dig> nm in diameter and are subunits of β- and α-particles  <cit> . glycogen particle sizes in skeletal muscle cells have been consistently shown to follow a continuous distribution pattern. in human skeletal muscle, diameters range from  <dig> to  <dig> nm and a mean value of  <dig> nm at rest  <cit>  and from  <dig> to  <dig> nm and a mean particle size of about  <dig> nm after exercise  <cit> . in cultured rat myotubes, these particles range from above  <dig> to above  <dig> nm  in glycogen-replete cells or from above  <dig> to below  <dig> nm  in glycogen-depleted ones  <cit> . strikingly, here we show that, despite being in a continuous range, the size distribution pattern of glycogen particles is determined by pp1-gts scaffolding, with average diameters in the order of ppp1r <dig> < gm < ptg. in control myotubes most glycogen particles corresponded to the β-type, with a mean diameter of  <dig>  nm. no particles smaller than about  <dig> nm were observed, but a few above  <dig> nm were found. notably, the detection limit for small glycogen granules is estimated to be 5- <dig> nm   <cit> , while the predicted maximum size limit of a granule is  <dig> nm, consisting of  <dig> tiers of carbohydrate  <cit> . ppp1r <dig> generated small granules, with a mean diameter of  <dig>  nm, with most of the granules falling below  <dig> nm and many between  <dig> and  <dig> nm. these granules resembled the γ-type in the formation of filamentous alignments  <cit> . gm-derived glycogen particles showed an intermediate mean diameter of  <dig>  nm and most were between  <dig> and  <dig> nm, which corresponds to the β-particle classification. ptg produced the largest particles, with a mean diameter of  <dig>  nm and values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. many of these particles looked like β-type ones, but we observed a few supramolecular clusters with a rosette-like shape that resembled α-particles. in fact, the larger α-type glycogen particles have not been observed in mammalian tissues other than liver  <cit> . since ptg is expressed abundantly in liver, in rats  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , we speculate that it induces the formation of α-particles in this tissue. in this regard, β particles are suggested to be covalently bonded to form α-particles through a hitherto unsuspected enzyme process operative in the liver  <cit> , which could be tissue-dependent.

the number of glycogen particles was increased by the three pp1-gtss tested. ppp1r <dig> and ptg induced the greatest increases in particle numbers and quantified glycogen accumulation. the rise in particle numbers per cell area for ppp1r <dig> was higher than with ptg, although quantification of extracted or cytochemically stained glycogen was not greater, probably because ptg-derived particles have bigger size and tend to form agglomerations of single β-particles. gm caused the smallest increase in the number of particles per cell area, which fits with glycogen quantification data. in fact, early muscle glycogen resynthesis has been shown to also rely on the synthesis of new particles. elsner et al.  <cit>  suggested that during early glycogen resynthesis in fasted cultured myotubes, new glycogen molecules are formed while there is a modest increase in glycogen particle diameter. graham and coworkers  <cit>  showed that, during recovery from prolonged exercise, resynthesis of muscle glycogen in humans is characterized initially by an increase in number and no change in particle size and later by an increase in particle size but not in number.

the subcellular distribution of glycogen-particles promoted by either pp1-gts has distinct patterns. in ppp1r6-myotubes, granules were closely associated with cellular components. in gm-myotubes, granules accumulated near the endoplasmic reticulum, which is consistent with gm association with sr via an sr-binding sequence in its c-terminal region  <cit> ; however, granules also appeared in other locations, preferentially subsarcolemmal ones. in fact, two forms of gm, an sr-associated form and a cytosolic glycogen-associated form, can be distinguished in rat skeletal muscle extracts  <cit> . in contrast, ptg caused the accumulation of glycogen granules in large clusters located in central areas of the cytosol devoid of cellular organelles. in control cells, glycogen granules were distributed throughout the cytosol. since in control myotubes the ppp1r3c gene is the most expressed gene  and ptg is strongly glycogenic, it can be argued that glycogen particles in these cells are mainly ptg-derived, which may explain their preferential cytosolic location. smaller granules were observed in control myotubes than in ptg-overexpressing cells, probably due to much lower glycogen accumulation in the former. we cannot rule out, however, a role for the still unstudied ppp1r3e protein. in the skeletal muscle tissue of humans  <cit>  and rats  <cit> , electron microscopy studies have shown compartmental distribution of glycogen particles in three main regions: subsarcolemmal, intermyofibrillar and intramyofibrillar. in the subsarcolemmal location, clustered accumulations are observed at the level of mitochondria and sr  <cit> , and nuclei and mitochondria  <cit> . aneurally cultured human myotubes are not fully differentiated, and likely this influences the pattern of cellular glycogen distribution. however, with ppp1r <dig> and gm we observed clustering of glycogen granules to the membrane of myotube organelles.

finally, here we applied computational scanning of the ppp1r <dig> protein sequence to gain insight into its potential subcellular distribution. these analyses revealed a high probability that ppp1r <dig> is located at the golgi complex or imported into the mitochondria. we thus analyzed the subcellular distribution of ppp1r <dig> tagged at the c-terminus with egfp. the tagged ppp1r <dig> showed a diffuse pattern in the cytosol in glucose-replete and -depleted cells and a punctuate pattern clustered around the nucleus in glucose-depleted cells only. since no colocation of tagged ppp1r <dig> with the mitochondrial-targeted rfp was observed, irrespective of glucose incubation, no support for the mitochondrial export premise was obtained. neither was colocation of the tagged ppp1r <dig> with the golgi-targeted rfp in glucose-replete c2c <dig> myoblasts. however, in glucose-depleted myoblasts the two proteins overlapped in the perinuclear region, according to the sequence-based prediction of ppp1r <dig> location in the golgi complex. therefore, our data suggest that ppp1r <dig> translocates in response to glucose from the golgi complex to a cytosolic location, where it is associated with glycogen. along this line of argument, ppp1r <dig> present in the glycogen/sarcovesicle fraction isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle is specifically associated with glycogen, since it is released by digestion of glycogen with α-amylase  <cit> . the role that ppp1r <dig>  or ppp1r6-targeted pp <dig>  may exert in the golgi apparatus in glucose-depleted myotubes is beyond the scope of this study. for instance, pp <dig> activity was previously reported to be essential in regulating vacuolar fusion and endoplasmic reticulum-to-golgi and endocytic vesicular trafficking in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . noteworthy, in muscle cells gs also shows differential intracellular distribution as a function of glycogen content. in skeletal muscle, gs translocates from a glycogen-enriched membrane fraction to the cytoskeleton as glycogen content is lowered  <cit>  or it is found associated with spherical structures formed by actin cytoskeleton rearrangement after glycogen-depletion  <cit> . in cultured c2c <dig> cells, muscle gs concentrates in the nucleus in the absence of glucose and translocates to the cytosol in response to glucose  <cit> . these data suggest that after cellular glycogen depletion, some glycogen-associated proteins, such as ppp1r <dig> and gs, may translocate to diverse cell compartments.

CONCLUSIONS
ppp1r <dig> gene expression has been described as highest in skeletal muscle and heart; however its relative transcript levels are much lower than those of other pp1-gtss in both human skeletal muscle tissue and primary cultured muscle. although ppp1r <dig> has low protein sequence homology with human gm and ppp1r <dig> proteins  <cit> , it exerts a powerful glycogenic effect in cultured muscle cells, more than gm and less than ptg. ppp1r <dig> translocates in response to glucose from the golgi complex to the cytosol, where it is presumably associated with glycogen. finally, we show that the pattern of size and subcellular distribution of glycogen particles is differentially determined by ppp1r <dig>  ptg or gm used as molecular scaffolding, which reveals that pp1-gtss confer glycogen granule regulation.
