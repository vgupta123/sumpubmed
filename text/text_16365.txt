BACKGROUND
developing a detailed knowledge of the developmental pathways involved in limb skeletogenesis is important for understanding skeletal abnormalities and disease processes, and for further unravelling the fundamental regulatory pathways that control development. the development of the vertebrate limb skeleton is initiated when multipotent mesenchymal cells in the limb bud aggregate to form mesenchymal condensations which prefigure the skeletal elements. cells within the pre-chondrogenic condensation up-regulate cell adhesion mechanisms and begin to synthesize specific extracellular matrix molecules, and the condensations expand through a combination of proliferation and recruitment of surrounding mesenchyme. the generation of these condensations creates an environment which is conducive to chondrogenic differentiation  <cit> . as the cells differentiate into chondrocytes, they synthesize a framework of cartilage matrix, known as an anlage, in the approximate shape of the future bone. chondrocytes in the centre of the anlage proceed through a series of discrete developmental stages that include proliferation, maturation and hypertrophy  <cit> . the hypertrophic cartilage is first calcified and then, following vascular invasion, replaced by primary bone that is subsequently remodelled to form secondary bone. this process radiates outwards from the centre of the anlage with the development of highly ordered growth plates that separate the cartilaginous epiphyses from the bony diaphysis. later in development, secondary centres of ossification develop within the epiphyses and, with subsequent fusion of the ossification centres during puberty, endochondral ossification and bone growth ceases.

the regulatory network that controls early chondrogenesis is incompletely understood although several key components have been characterized. prior to pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation in the developing vertebrate limb bud, bmp expression is upregulated in the mesenchyme flanking the anterior and posterior margins and in the presumptive interdigital mesenchyme, in a manner consistent with a role for these genes in limb patterning and in initiating chondrogenesis and skeletal development  <cit> . furthermore, viral misexpression of the bmp-antagonist, noggin, in the developing limb during embryogenesis  <cit>  and targeted over-expression of noggin in chondroprogenitor cells  <cit> , both result in complete blockage of mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis, proving the requirement for bmp signalling in the initiation of chondrogenesis. bmp signalling serves multiple purposes during the initiation of chondrogenesis; it may contribute to the recruitment of cells to the condensation, the proliferation of cells within the condensation, as well as regulating the expression of genes involved in driving the differentiation of condensed mesenchyme  <cit> . in addition to the roles of bmps in skeletal development per se, bmp, along with bmp antagonists  and members of the gdf  family are involved in controlling the cartilage condensations that develop into the synovial joint. the fgf family of growth factors and their receptors also play an important role in chondrocyte differentiation, possibly by limiting chondrocyte proliferation, since activating mutations in fgfr <dig> cause achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and fgfr3-deficient mice have an enlarged growth plate. a critical component of chondrocyte lineage specification is sox <dig> , which exerts its influence over chondrogenesis, in part, by regulating the expression of multiple cartilage-specific proteins including col2a <dig>  <cit> . the influence of sox <dig> on chondrogenesis is largely dependent upon sox <dig> and sox <dig>  with which it co-regulates the chondrogenic program  <cit> .

in addition to the signalling cascades, the extracellular matrix  plays a fundamental role in morphogenesis and development by regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, and migration, and by modulating growth factor bioavailability. mesenchymal condensations are characterized by the expression of a specific ecm, components of which include fibronectin  <cit> , tenascin c  <cit> , ng <dig> proteoglycan  <cit> , syndecan  <cit> , and chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycans  <cit> . the ecm has important roles in promoting the condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells  <cit> . as the cells differentiate into chondrocytes they express specific ecm components with unique functional and biological characteristics which are critical for cartilage structure and function  <cit> . the predominant, well-characterized cartilage matrix components are the proteoglycan, aggrecan, and members of the collagen protein family. collagen ii is a major homotrimeric collagen expressed throughout the cartilage that interacts specifically with other minor collagens such as ix and xi to modulate interfibrillar interactions between the heterotypic collagen fibrils  <cit> . mutations in many of these collagen genes have been identified in human chondrodysplasias and in mouse models  <cit> . collagen vi is a microfibrillar collagen which is found localized in the pericellular space around chondrocytes in epiphyseal cartilage.

cartilage contains many other proteins, some of which have been well-characterized and whose roles in cartilage structure and function have been elucidated  <cit> . some of the best characterized components are the small leucine-rich proteins , such as decorin, fibromodulin, lumican and biglycan which interact with collagen fibrils and influence collagen fibrillar architecture and function. these slrps have growth factor binding properties that may have profound influences on cartilage cell proliferation. cartilage oligomeric matrix protein also binds collagen fibrils and may also mediate cell-matrix interactions. other proteins include chondroadherin and thrombospondin which have cell-matrix binding properties; tenascins, osteonectin and members of the matrilin family, matrilins  <dig> and  <dig>  that are thought to form interacting assemblies integrating the collagen and proteoglycan networks.

while a number of the chondrogenesis genes have been extensively characterized, the full spectrum of components involved in regulating chondrogenesis during limb development has yet to be determined. however, with the advent of high quality whole genome microarrays we now have the unique opportunity to determine the comprehensive gene expression pattern of processes such as chondrogenesis, to define novel components and further unravel the complex developmental processes involved. the application of such expression profiling approaches to cartilage formation in vivo has thus far been restricted by the technical challenge of obtaining high quality rna from the target tissues. consequently, expression studies to date have been conducted on either whole mouse limbs  <cit>  or on in vitro models of chondrogenesis  <cit> . while these studies have been useful in identifying some chondrogenic genes, they suffer from the limitations of analysing heterogeneous tissues or the complex gene expression consequences that may result from in vitro culture.

in this study we report the first global gene expression profiling analysis of the transition of pre-condensed mesenchymal cells into mesenchymal condensations, and their subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes, using tissue microdissected from in vivo mouse limb buds. by comparison of the gene expression profiles of cartilage pre-condensation tissue at  <dig>  dpc, mesenchymal condensations at  <dig>  dpc, and differentiated cartilage tissue at  <dig>  dpc, we were able to identify the candidate gene cohorts involved in the initiation of chondrogenesis and in the early development of cartilage anlagen. as well as identifying novel genes that may be critical in the regulation and maintenance of chondrogenesis, our data allowed us to present the first comprehensive expression analysis of the known developmentally important gene families during in vivo chondrogenesis during mouse limb skeletal development. these data provide confirmation of the role of many members of these key gene families, and also implicate other members of these, and other gene families in chondrogenesis for the first time.

RESULTS
microdissected samples from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc encompass the initial developmental steps of chondrogenesis
prior to microarray analysis, the differential expression of selected key markers of mesenchymal condensation and chondrogenesis was assayed by semi-quantitative pcr to confirm the developmental stage represented by each microdissected tissue sample . the genes chosen for semi-quantitative pcr analysis were n-cadherin , aggrecan , collagen ii , cartilage oligomeric matrix protein , cartilage link protein  and the gene encoding s <dig> ribosomal rna, which was included as a loading standard. ncad is a cell-cell adhesion molecule whose role in mesenchymal condensation during limb development has been well characterized  <cit> . expression of aggrecan, collagen ii, comp and cartilage link protein is indicative of cartilage formation  <cit> .

semi-quantitative pcr demonstrated ncad transcripts were abundant at  <dig>  dpc, immediately prior to the commencement of mesenchymal condensation. a marked decrease in ncad transcription was observed by  <dig>  dpc and this low level of expression was maintained until  <dig>  dpc. agc <dig> and col2a <dig> were present at low levels in  <dig>  dpc embryos, well before the deposition of significant extracellular matrix. transcription of both these markers increased by  <dig>  dpc, and they became highly abundant by  <dig>  dpc. neither comp nor hapln <dig> transcripts were present at levels detectable by semi-quantitative rt-pcr at  <dig>  dpc. low-level transcription of comp and hapln <dig> was observed at  <dig>  dpc, and increased dramatically by  <dig>  dpc. these data provided clear evidence that the microdissected regions of the limb buds represented mesenchymal condensations undergoing the in vivo transition from undifferentiated chondroprogenitor cells to differentiated chondrocytes.

whole genome expression profiling
as an overall representation of the microarray hybridizations, m/a scatter plots were generated for each time point comparison in which the mean signal intensity  for each microarray probe was plotted against the relative fold difference for that probe . negative control probes, which are not complementary to any mouse mrna sequences, have been included on these microarrays by the manufacturer to gauge non-specific, background fluorescence. using these probes, it was determined that an average log <dig> intensity of less than or equal to six represented background fluorescence .

scatter plot comparisons were generated by subtracting the signal intensity of  <dig>  dpc from  <dig>  dpc ,  <dig>  dpc from  <dig>  dpc , and  <dig>  dpc from  <dig>  dpc . by plotting the data in this manner for each of the three comparisons, genes which were expressed in equal relative abundance between time points were plotted close to zero on the relative fold difference  axis. genes which were more highly expressed at the later time points were plotted on the positive scale of the relative fold difference axis . conversely, genes which were more highly expressed at the earlier time points were plotted on the negative scale of the relative fold difference axis . the data-points for selected markers of mesenchymal condensation , chondrogenesis , myogenesis , and chondrocyte hypertrophy , as well as a house keeping gene as an internal standard  have been highlighted in each scatter plot. it can be seen in each of the plots in figure  <dig> that the selected markers of chondrogenesis were found to be expressed more highly in the later time point, while markers of mesenchymal condensation were found to be expressed more highly at the earlier time point. consistently, the average log <dig> intensity for col10a <dig> was found to be below six, confirming that col10a <dig>  a marker of cartilage hypertrophy, was not expressed in any of the microdissected tissues and that the cartilage anlagen microdissected at  <dig>  dpc were pre-hypertrophic. for myod <dig>  the average log <dig> intensity was found to be very close to background level and the relative fold difference close to zero, indicating negligible myod <dig> expression in these tissues, and suggesting that there was no significant contamination of the microdissected tissues by myogenic precursors.

in order to generate global representations of biological processes driving chondrogenesis, the microarray data were mined using ontoexpress gene ontology software. genes up-regulated or down-regulated between  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc by at least three-fold, and for which an average log <dig> intensity > <dig> was detected, were classified according to biological process . by this method,  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes were identified –  <dig> down-regulated genes and  <dig> up-regulated genes. these genes are shown in additional file  <dig>  the full microarray dataset are available from the gene expression omnibus  database repository .

validation of microarray data
three approaches were taken to validate the microarray dataset generated in the present study – quantitative pcr , in situ hybridization, and an extensive comparison of the gene expression dataset generated in this study with expression and function data pertaining to the same genes in the scientific literature. to provide microarray validation over a wide range of gene expression levels we performed qpcr on genes expressed at high levels by chondrocytes, such as extracellular matrix components , and also those expressed at much lower levels, such as transcription factors . in addition, array validation was performed for representative genes from the developmentally important gene families; adhesion molecules, secreted signalling molecules, transcription factors and extracellular matrix molecules.

quantitative pcr
using unmodified crna samples amplified in parallel to those crna samples generated for the microarray analyses, qpcr was performed on selected genes as a technical validation for the microarray data. qpcr was performed on agc <dig> , bmp8a , col2a <dig> , fgfr <dig> , foxa <dig> , gdf <dig> , klf <dig> , klf <dig> , lepre <dig> , ncad , sox <dig> , and trpv <dig> . for each marker, a close correlation was observed between the pattern of differential gene expression determined using either technique, with highest expression for markers of mesenchymal condensation seen between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, and highest expression for markers of chondrogenesis seen at  <dig>  dpc.

in situ hybridization
in order to validate the microarray data further with independent, biological replicates, in situ hybridization was performed on sagittal sections from  <dig>  dpc,  <dig>  dpc, and  <dig>  dpc mouse hind limb buds using probes for sox <dig> , pcdh <dig> , lepre <dig> , and trpv <dig> . in each case, the gene expression detected by in situ hybridization corroborated the expression profiles generated by microarray and clarified the expression of these genes in the limb bud beyond the microdissected areas.

strong expression of sox <dig> was observed throughout the limb bud and also in the adjacent somites at  <dig>  dpc . at  <dig>  dpc, expression of sox <dig> was generally weaker than at  <dig>  dpc, and found to be most highly expressed in the interdigital mesenchyme distally, and localized to the tibial and fibular mesenchymal condensations, as well as the anterior and posterior margins of the limb bud proximally . at  <dig>  dpc, sox <dig> expression was very weak distally and absent from the tibia and fibula . this pattern of sox <dig> expression agrees with the expression profiles generated by microarray and qpcr, where sox <dig> was found to be down-regulated during development of the tibial and fibular cartilage anlagen. similarly, pcdh <dig> also exhibited declining expression levels from  <dig>  dpc– <dig>  dpc. at  <dig>  dpc, pcdh <dig> expression was detected in the precondensed tibial and fibular mesenchyme  but was absent from the distal limb at e <dig>  . in contrast, pcdh <dig> expression at e <dig>  was predominantly detected surrounding the femoral condensation  but became undetectable within the limb by e <dig>  . thus, as with the expression profile generated by microarray for pcdh <dig>  in situ hybridization confirmed that expression of pcdh <dig> is down-regulated in the areas of tibial and fibular development.

lepre <dig> expression was not detectable in the limb bud at  <dig>  dpc . by  <dig>  dpc, weak expression of lepre <dig> was observed in the femoral, tibial, and fibular prechondrogenic mesenchymal condensations . lepre <dig> was found to be highly expressed throughout the cartilage anlagen, though not in the perichondrium, at  <dig>  dpc . similar results were obtained for trpv <dig>  which was not detectable at either  <dig>  dpc  or  <dig>  dpc , but which was highly expressed throughout the cartilage anlagen at  <dig>  dpc .

the in situ hybridization data presented here for sox <dig>  pcdh <dig>  lepre <dig>  and trpv <dig> are consistent with the expression profiles generated for these genes in the present study by microarray analysis and qpcr. in so doing, they reinforce the utility of the present microarray dataset for providing accurate information about the expression profiles of developing chondrogenic tissues in vivo.

comparative literature analysis
as a third approach to validating the microarray data generated in the present study, an extensive survey of the scientific literature was carried out in order to compare our gene expression dataset with expression and function data pertaining to the same genes examined in previous studies . for the  <dig> genes surveyed, we found that our expression profiles were highly consistent with previously published data, emphasising the value of the present dataset as a tool for further understanding the dynamic gene expression environment controlling in vivo chondrogenesis.

differential expression of gene families during chondrogenesis
adhesion molecules
consistent with their roles in mediating cell-cell contacts, it was found that most protocadherins  and cadherins  were down-regulated from  <dig>  dpc – immediately prior to the commencement of mesenchymal condensation, to  <dig>  dpc – when cartilage anlagen have formed. the protocadherins are a family of type i membrane proteins belonging to the cadherin superfamily which are characterized by multiple extracellular cadherin domains and unique intracellular domains bridged by a single membrane-spanning segment  <cit> . the function of the protocadherins is unclear and while they may function in cell-cell adhesion, they are also likely to have a role in intercellular signalling. of the differentially regulated protocadherin  genes , the most highly down-regulated were pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig>  pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig> were also found to be significantly down-regulated, but more highly expressed than pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig>  none of the protocadherins were found to be significantly up-regulated during in vivo chondrogenesis. to date, none of the protocadherins have been implicated in chondrogenesis, and pcdh <dig> is the only protocadherin previously found to be expressed during limb development  <cit> .

the cadherin genes encode membrane-spanning proteins characterized by multiple cadherin domains which mediate calcium-dependent homophilic adhesion between neighbouring cells in a wide range of developmental processes  <cit> . among the cadherin  genes , cdh <dig> and cdh <dig> were found to exhibit the highest differential expression. notably, expression of both of these genes peaked during mesenchymal condensation at  <dig>  dpc, before being down-regulated in the cartilage anlagen at  <dig>  dpc. cdh <dig>  although not significantly differentially expressed, was found to be very highly expressed throughout in vivo chondrogenesis. cdh <dig> has recently been shown to be a discriminative factor between articular and growth plate cartilage chondrocytes  <cit> . n-cadherin  was found to be very highly expressed and was down-regulated by almost 3-fold from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc, consistent with its characterized role in condensation.

ncam was highly expressed throughout in vivo chondrogenesis, and marginally up-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. it is recognized that in the context of chondrogenesis, cell-cell adhesion is most likely mediated primarily by cdh <dig>  <cit>  and cdh <dig> – in conjunction with other factors such as ncam <dig>  <cit> . this view is supported by the findings presented here, in which ncam <dig>  along with cdh <dig> and cdh <dig> were highly expressed during the initiation of chondrogenesis, while other cadherins were expressed at a much lower level .

secreted signalling molecules
the relative differential expression of genes belonging to major families of signalling molecules secreted during in vivo chondrogenesis are shown . included in this category are the bone morphogenetic protein  family , the growth differentiation factor  family , the wingless-related mmtv integration site  family , and the fibroblast growth factor family . the chondroinductive potential of the bmp family has been extensively analysed, and it is known that chondrogenesis may be induced by the activity of bmp <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit> , and bmp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, expression of bmp8a in developing long bones has been demonstrated, and it is known to map to the mouse achondroplasia locus  <cit> , suggesting that it too may be an important regulator of chondrogenesis. consistent with these observations, bmp8a was found to be the most highly differentially expressed bmp gene, up-regulated over 50-fold between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> were also highly differentially expressed. bmp <dig> was more highly expressed than bmp8a, while overall expression of bmp <dig> was low. although not highly differentially expressed, bmp <dig> was found, like bmp <dig>  to be very highly expressed. expression of bmp <dig> was found to be absent from this assay of in vivo chondrogenesis.

it is known that the gdf family contributes to the regulation of chondrogenesis. gdf <dig> may induce chondrogenesis in vitro  <cit> , and it has been used to induce ectopic chondrogenesis in vivo, in part by stimulating expression of another marker of chondrogenesis, transcription factor barx <dig>  <cit> . moreover, single gene knock-outs of gdf <dig> and gdf <dig> resulted in defects in multiple elements of the appendicular and craniofacial skeletons, while a more severe skeletal phenotype was observed for the gdf5/gdf <dig> double knock-out mouse  <cit> . these findings are consistent with the extremely similar differential expression profiles determined for gdf <dig> and gdf <dig> in the present study, in which the expression of both genes peaked significantly at  <dig>  dpc . by contrast, little is known of the role of gdf <dig> in chondrogenesis. indeed, the only report to date in which gdf <dig> has been implicated in skeletal biology concerned its expression during bone repair in a model of fracture healing  <cit> . the steady up-regulation of gdf <dig> observed between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc in the present study however, suggests that gdf <dig> may play an important role in mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte maturation. overall, six gdf genes were expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis . gdf <dig> was found to be most highly differentially expressed, peaking at  <dig>  dpc, although overall expression of gdf <dig> was very low. both gdf <dig> and gdf <dig> were strongly expressed, and highly differentially expressed. gdf <dig>  although not highly differentially expressed, was found to be expressed strongly throughout in vivo chondrogenesis.

it is well established that wnt proteins mediate important signalling pathways at various stages of chondrogenesis. accordingly, wnt gene expression in vivo is found to be spatially and temporally restricted within the developing cartilage anlage. wnt <dig> expression is localized to the developing joints, wnt5a to the perichondrium, and wnt5b to the perichondrium and prehypertrophic chondrocytes  <cit> . moreover, functional work presented in the same studies demonstrated that wnt <dig> promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy, while wnt5a and wnt5b operate conversely, by impeding terminal chondrocyte differentiation. thus, while the data generated by microarray analysis here provides valuable information about relative expression levels, the authors recognise that it cannot provide information regarding the spatial distribution of transcripts within the microdissected tissues. among the wnt family, only wnt <dig> and wnt5b were strongly expressed, and only one wnt  was found to be highly differentially expressed and dramatically up-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc . conversely, frizzled-related protein , a wnt antagonist, was found to be strongly expressed, and down-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc .

despite their prominent role in controlling aspects of endochondral bone growth, little is known about the expression or function of fgf ligands and fgf receptors within mesenchymal condensations and subsequent cartilage anlagen  <cit> . recent work however points to a role for fgf <dig> in regulating chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy during the earliest stages of chondrogenesis  through interaction with fgfr <dig>  <cit> . our differential expression data  support and extend these findings by revealing significant up-regulation of both fgf <dig> and fgfr <dig> between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, and by clarifying the differential expression patterns of fgf ligands and fgf receptors within chondrogenic tissue in vivo. of considerable interest was the finding that fgfr <dig> expression is significantly up-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. fgfr <dig> has not previously been associated with chondrogenesis, although it is known to mediate early events in the signalling cascade regulating skeletal muscle development in the developing limb  <cit> . the fgfr <dig> differential expression data presented here imply that in addition to the role of fgf <dig> in myogenesis, it may also have a role in chondrogenesis.

transcription factors
the first families of transcription factors considered here are the homeo box  genes . a large group of genes comprised of four gene clusters, the hox genes were mostly found to be down-regulated from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc, although the opposite trend was observed for some hox genes. only three members  of the hoxa gene cluster were strongly expressed. the most highly differentially expressed of these was hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig> were more strongly expressed than hoxa <dig> however, although neither was significantly differentially expressed. four hoxb genes were weakly expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis, and none of them were highly differentially expressed. only one hoxc gene  was highly differentially expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis, down-regulated by almost 3-fold from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc. none of the other hoxc genes were significantly differentially expressed, although the expression level of hoxc <dig> was found to be very high throughout the time course. most of the hoxd gene cluster were very weakly expressed. the most highly down-regulated hoxd genes were generally the more 3' members of the cluster . while hox genes have established roles in pattern formation, they may play additional roles in chondrogenesis. the overall down-regulation of the more highly expressed members of the hox family suggests that hox gene silencing may be required for the progression of cartilage formation. transgenic mouse data showing that the persistent expression of hoxa <dig> in cells entering chondrogenesis impairs cartilage development and causes chondrodysplasia  <cit> , supports this inhibitory role for at least a subset of hox genes. a further early role for hox genes in regulating the expression of the key chondrogenic transcription factor, sox <dig>  has been shown in recent experiments  <cit> .

interestingly, while many hox genes were found to be down-regulated in chondrogenic tissue from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc in the present study, three hox genes  were up-regulated during this time by close to or greater than two-fold. this is the first time that vertebrate limb expression data has been published for hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig>  and hoxc <dig> 

eight t-box  genes were expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis . of these tbx <dig>  tbx <dig> and tbx <dig>  were all strongly expressed and highly down-regulated from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc.

expression of  <dig> sry-box  genes was detected during in vivo chondrogenesis . of these, four were found to be highly expressed although none of these four genes were significantly differentially expressed. among these genes were sox <dig> and sox <dig>  moderate expression levels were detected for five sox genes and of these, only sox <dig> was significantly differentially expressed, up-regulated by almost 4-fold between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. seven sox genes were found to be expressed weakly during in vivo chondrogenesis. expression data generated in the present study are consistent with the importance of sox <dig> throughout chondrogenesis  <cit> . sox <dig> was not highly differentially expressed from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc but its average log <dig> intensity was found to be extremely high, indicating ubiquitously high expression of sox <dig> throughout the transition from pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal cell to fully differentiated chondrocyte. it is known that sox <dig> exerts its influence over chondrogenesis, in part, by regulating the expression of multiple prominent components of the cartilage matrix including the quintessential chondrocyte marker, col2a <dig>  <cit> . this transcriptional activity was found to be largely dependent upon the combined activity of a long form of sox <dig> , and sox <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, sox <dig> expression closely resembles that of sox <dig> in that although it was not found to be highly differentially expressed throughout chondrogenesis, its absolute expression level  was found to be very high.

interestingly sox <dig> expression was quite low in the present study . it is possible that this result does not accurately reflect the abundance of sox <dig> transcripts because of technical limitations with array design. the single probe for sox <dig> on the microarray is located  <dig> bp upstream of the 3'-end of the mouse sox <dig> coding sequence, and since the amplified rna used to interrogate to array has an inherent 3' bias, it is likely that this results in an inability to hybridize efficiently.

our results also demonstrate that additional sox genes, sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig> participate in chondrogenesis in vivo. previous studies have shown sox <dig> expression localized to diaphyseal hypertrophic chondrocytes during the commencement of long bone ossification, and later in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the embryonic growth plate  <cit> , as well as along the posterior margin, and proximally on the anterior margin of chicken limb buds at a stage equivalent to mouse hindlimb  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . expression of sox <dig> and sox <dig> has also been noted previously in limb development, occurring, like that of sox <dig>  sox <dig>  and sox <dig>  in a manner which essentially prefigures the developing skeleton  <cit> . moreover, in the same study it was noted that each of these genes was up-regulated in ectopic cartilages in response to bmp <dig>  implying roles for sox <dig> and sox <dig> in chondrogenesis. the highly similar expression patterns detected for sox <dig> and sox <dig> here suggest that these genes may have overlapping functions in vivo. that sox <dig> and sox <dig> are most highly expressed at  <dig>  dpc points towards roles for these genes in vivo in chondrocyte maturation, or in preparing chondrocytes for subsequent hypertrophy. sox <dig> was up-regulated from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc, to a level at which it was maintained until  <dig>  dpc. the association of sox <dig> with limb bud development has recently been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry  <cit> .

another large transcription factor family of which multiple members were found to exhibit dynamic patterns of differential expression was the forkhead box  gene family . three fox genes were very highly expressed. notably, foxc <dig> was significantly up-regulated, almost 3-fold between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, and approximately  <dig>  fold by  <dig>  dpc. furthermore, foxo <dig> and foxp <dig> were both strongly expressed, and differentially expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis, although the expression patterns of these transcription factors differed markedly. whereas foxo <dig> expression was found to increase in a linear fashion by almost 5-fold between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, foxp <dig> expression peaked at  <dig>  dpc, before dropping by greater than 3-fold by  <dig>  dpc. a further four fox genes were moderately expressed. one of these genes, foxa <dig>  was dramatically up-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc, by over 20-fold. seven other fox genes were weakly expressed and of these, only foxd <dig> was differentially expressed, up-regulated more than 4-fold from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc.

only two fox genes however, have been implicated in skeletogenesis to date. foxa <dig> transcripts have been detected by in situ hybridization in the vertebrae and ribs of  <dig>  dpc mouse embryos  <cit> , while expression of foxc <dig> has been observed during axial and appendicular skeletogenesis in mouse. interestingly, in the developing limb, it was found that foxc <dig> transcripts localized to the periphery of the mesenchymal condensation at  <dig>  dpc, and the perichondrium of the cartilage anlagen at  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . the function of foxa <dig> and foxc <dig> during chondrogenesis remains unknown.

extracellular matrix molecules
chondrogenesis involves the secretion of a complex extracellular matrix rich in collagens and non-collagenous proteoglycans. thus, it was expected that many genes encoding components of cartilage extracellular matrix would be dramatically up-regulated during in vivo chondrogenesis. the results which follow include the differential expression patterns observed for prominent non-collagenous extracellular matrix proteins as well as for the collagen gene family and the integrin family, which encode extracellular matrix receptors.

as predicted, many genes encoding cartilage extracellular matrix molecules were highly up-regulated . it was found that cartilage link protein  was highly expressed, and by far the most highly up-regulated gene during in vivo chondrogenesis, its expression having increased approximately 200-fold between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. cartilage oligomeric matrix protein , aggrecan , matrilin  <dig> , and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan  <dig>  were also highly expressed and very highly up-regulated between  <dig>  dpc and  <dig>  dpc. matrilin  <dig>  and matrilin  <dig>  were also very highly up-regulated, although they were expressed only moderately. the most highly expressed of these genes were cspg <dig> and matn <dig>  although matn <dig> was not found to be differentially expressed. fibronectin  <dig>  was not differentially expressed, and its expression was moderate. versican  expression was down-regulated by over 10-fold from  <dig>  dpc to  <dig>  dpc while tenascin c  expression was moderate but was up-regulated by almost 8-fold. as with other components of the cartilage ecm, many collagen genes and integrins were differentially expressed during in vivo chondrogenesis .

ontology approaches identify a large cohort of novel genes expressed during chondrogenesis for further investigation
the importance of this study is realised by the utility of the microarray data as an invaluable resource for investigating the roles of novel genes during in vivo chondrogenesis. in order to identify such genes, ontological approaches were undertaken to classify differentially expressed genes according to biological process and thus identify those for which an association with ontologies relating to cartilage and skeletal development has yet to be made. accordingly, the  <dig> genes for which a differential expression of greater than three and a average log <dig> intensity of greater than or equal to six was observed between  <dig>  dpc –  <dig>  dpc  were interrogated by gostat software using the mgi go gene association database  in order to identify highly represented gene ontologies. as predicted, ontologies relating to cartilage and skeletal development were observed. among the down-regulated genes,  <dig> were classified under 'skeletal development' . among the up-regulated genes,  <dig> were classified under 'skeletal development' ,  <dig> under 'ossification' ,  <dig> under 'cartilage development' ,  <dig> under 'chondrocyte differentiation' , and  <dig> under 'cartilage condensation' . of these genes,  <dig> appeared under multiple classifications. therefore, a total of  <dig> genes were classified by gostat analysis as having previously been implicated in cartilage or skeletal development, leaving  <dig> novel genes for which an ontological association with chondrogenesis has yet to made. thus, this study has served to identify a large cohort of novel genes whose expression or function during in vivo chondrogenesis is uncharacterized and potentially represents important developmental regulators. this dataset is therefore an important reference for future gene discovery and stands as an invaluable resource for ongoing research into skeletal development and disease.

our studies are the first comprehensive attempt to identify genes which regulate the initiation of chondrogenesis in vivo. we have described the differential expression patterns observed for major gene families encoding adhesion molecules, transcription factors, and signalling molecules known to be important in many developmental processes, and have implicated members of these developmental gene families in chondrogenesis for the first time. in addition, we have identified many new candidate genes that may be involved in the initiation of chondrogenesis, on the basis of their differential expression patterns observed here, in combination with their known association with specific biological processes or known molecular function.

CONCLUSIONS
by conducting whole genome microarray analyses of rna derived specifically from tissues representative of key stages of in vivo limb bud chondrogenesis, we have generated and thoroughly validated expression profiles which for the first time define the suite of genes expressed by chondrogenic tissues in the formation of cartilage from pre-condensed mesenchyme during embryogenesis. in doing so, we have defined the expression profiles of known chondrogenically and developmentally important gene families expressed by chondrogenic tissues during cartilage formation, and have identified  <dig> genes significantly differentially expressed during this process, consisting of large gene cohorts particular to each stage of cartilage development – pre-condensed mesenchyme, mesenchymal condensations, and cartilage anlagen. it is anticipated that these data will be important in further unravelling the fundamental control networks which drive cartilage development, in investigating the molecular pathology of inherited skeletal diseases, and in exploring which properties of pre-skeletal limb bud mesenchymal cells predispose them to efficient chondrogenic differentiation, the understanding of which promises to aid research into therapeutic cartilage repair. thus, the data-set generated in this study stands as an important development for skeletal biology research.
