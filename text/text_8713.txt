BACKGROUND
litchi is one of the most important subtropical evergreen fruit trees in southern asia. a major factor determining litchi crop production is the competition between vegetative and reproductive growth during floral differentiation. floral initiation in litchi could be triggered by low temperatures and enhanced by droughts in autumn and winter  <cit> . in the following spring, the apical buds will break and elongate as the air temperature and soil moisture rise. next, the axillary or apical panicle primordia will emerge and become visible as “whitish millets”  <cit> . at this millet stage, floral buds are considered to be mixed buds containing axillary or apical panicle primordia, leaf primordia and rudimentary leaves. whether these mixed buds could develop into flowers are largely dependent on the environmental conditions. under normal climate conditions, the growth of panicle primordia will prevail and the rudimentary leaves will abscise. however, if the buds are exposed to high temperature, the rudimentary leaves could develop into fully expanded leaves and the panicle primordia will cease to develop and shrink  <cit> . suppressing the growth of the rudimentary leaves encourages panicle development. warm winter and hot spring potentially resulted from global warming present a major threat to litchi flowering. in order to develop a counter measure, it is important to understand the genetics behind litchi bud development, and the abortion of the rudimentary leaves.

we have previously shown that ethylene could promote abortion of rudimentary leaves. it is associated with an increase in h2o2
 <cit> , a type of reactive oxygen species . it is well known that environmental stresses stimulate ros production in plants  <cit> . they act as key signals in response to stresses  <cit> . in arabidopsis, h2o <dig> has been shown to be elevated in leaves at the time of floral transition  <cit> . it has been proposed that h2o <dig> bursts generate a signal in leaves associated with either the induction of flowering or leaf senescence  <cit> . the ethylene-induced h2o <dig> might act as a signal which induces abortion of rudimentary leaves in the panicle and promotes flowering in litchi. methyl viologen dichloride hydrate  is a ros producer in plants. it can generate superoxide by accepting an electron from psi to become a reduced free radical, which is immediately reoxidized by dioxygen, producing superoxide in chloroplast  <cit> . mv also induces the increase of superoxide production in mitochondria, where complexes i and iii are the major electron donors  <cit> . superoxide is then transformed to h2o <dig> by superoxide dismutase  <cit> . when the litchi leafy panicles were treated with mv, it was found that ros accumulated, the rudimentary leaves abscised and the numbers of flowers per panicle increased  <cit> . we have also shown that ros increased the expression of lclfy and lcap <dig> in panicles  <cit> . studies on arabidopsis and other plants indicated that lfy  is a transcription factor which determines the floral meristem identity and is strongly expressed in the flower buds  <cit> . constitutive expression of arabidopsis ap <dig>  has also been shown to promote flowering in citrus  <cit> . ap <dig> is involved in the transition from floral induction to flower formation and constitutes a hub in the corresponding network of regulatory genes  <cit> . beside a few ros responsive est clones derived from a suppression subtractive hybridization  library screen  <cit> , little is known about the transcriptional network controlling litchi flowering.

without a litchi reference genome, de novo transcriptome assembly using illumina short rna-seq reads is the most cost effective approach for generating a large collection of ests suitable for subsequent transcriptome analysis. this method has been successfully applied to chinese bayberry  and watermelon  matsum. & nakai var. lanatus) for fruit development and ripening studies  <cit> , pear  for bud dormancy analysis  <cit> , and litchi  and melon  for fruit abscission study  <cit> . though litchi fruit transcriptome sequencing data were published  <cit> , those of leaves are unknown. in this study, we have constructed a litchi reference transcriptome for rudimentary leaves using illumina rna sequencing . we also used digital gene expression assay to profile the transcriptome dynamics of ros treated rudimentary leaves, in order to elucidate genetic network of the ros-induced abortion.

RESULTS
mv induced abortion of rudimentary leaves
in our previous study, we found that an early sign of abortion of rudimentary leaves was downward growth of the leaves  <cit> . to confirm the effect of mv treatment, shoot cuttings were treated with water or mv in a growth chamber. the proximal angle  and the distal angle  of the third and the fourth mv-treated rudimentary leaves were measured . we used this experimental system for the easy control of light intensity and temperature. furthermore, in our preliminary study, it was confirmed that detached shoots could survive in water without wilting for at least  <dig> d. to avoid the immediate effect of the cutting from trees, treatments were carried out after the shoots were placed in water for 2 h. the results showed that proximal angle α had no significant change during the treatments, while the distal angle β significantly increased after the treatment . the ros-treated rudimentary leaves showed epinasty as characterized by downward curvature of leaves , presenting an early sign of abortion  <cit> .figure  <dig>

sequence, assembly and annotation of a litchi reference transcriptome
to obtain a reference litchi transcriptome for the rudimentary leaves, a rna-seq library has been constructed using rna from all leaf samples. as shown in table  <dig>  we have generated  <dig>  g of total nucleotides with a q <dig> percentage of  <dig> %. the trinity package assembled  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of 710 bp . the size distributions of these unigenes are shown in additional file  <dig>  58%  of unigenes could be annotated by blastx  using the ncbi nr database, while  <dig>  were annotated using the swiss-prot protein database. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes could be annotated according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and cluster of orthologous groups of protein  database, respectively. about 10%  unigenes could be assigned to a homolog in all four databases . based on the ncbi nr database,  <dig> % of the unigenes showed homology ,  <dig> % of those showed strong homology  and the remaining  <dig> % were very strong homology  to available plant sequences . as shown in figure 2c,  <dig>  unigenes were annotated to  <dig> top-hit species, including glycine max, arabidopsis thaliana, medicago truncatula and populus trichocarpa.  <dig>  unigenes could be classified into  <dig> gene ontology  categories: cellular component, biological process, and molecular function .  <dig>  unigenes of the rudimentary leaves in litchi were mapped into  <dig> kegg pathways . the maps with the highest unigene representation were ribosome pathway  with  <dig> ungenes counted, followed by protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum , starch and sucrose metabolism , rna transport , purine metabolism , spliceosome  and plant hormone signal transduction pathway .table  <dig>

identify differentially expressed genes using digital gene expression tag 
to identify differentially expressed genes in response to ros,  <dig> dge libraries have been generated from ros-treated rudimentary leaves at 0 h, 5 h and 10 h post treatment, with two biological replicates. the libraries produced over  <dig>  g of 49 nt single-end read data with a q <dig> percentage of about 98%. the percentage of unassigned base “n” is  <dig> % and the average gc content is around 45% . to assay the normality of the rna-seq data in the  <dig> dge libraries, we calculated the distribution of unique reads in each dge libraries. this value is the ratio of the number of bases in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to the total bases in that from our transcriptome reference database. the distribution over different reads abundance categories showed similar patterns among all six libraries. above 36% of the sequences have coverage more than 80% . next we calculated the unigene expression using the uniquely mapped dge reads and normalized the results to rpkm. results from the two biological replicates are highly similar, suggesting good reproducibility of the method . we performed a pairwise comparison using 0 h as the control, and 5 h, or 10 h as the treatments. we also identified differentially expressed unigenes with fdr  ≤  <dig>  and absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig>  as a result,  <dig>  unigenes were referred to as differentially expressed genes  and used for the subsequent analysis .

go-term analysis of differentially expressed genes
to examine the expression profile of the  <dig>  degs, the expression data υ  were normalized to  <dig>  log <dig> , log <dig> .  <dig>  degs could be clustered into  <dig> profiles by short time-series expression miner software , in which  <dig>  were clustered into  <dig> profiles , including two down-regulated patterns  and two up-regulated patterns  . profile  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig>  and  <dig> degs respectively, while profile  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig>  and  <dig> degs . next, the degs within the up- and down-regulated cluster groups were subjected to go-term analysis. they were classified into  <dig> main categories including cellular component, biological process, and molecular function. under the cellular component category, a large number of up-regulation, as well as down-regulation degs were categorized as cell part, cell and organelle. under biological process category, most of those were classified into cellular process and metabolic process. for molecular function category, catalytic activity and binding were the top abundant subcategories .figure  <dig>

in the auxin signal transduction pathway,  <dig> unigenes encoding auxin influx transport protein  were found to be differentially expressed, among which two were annotated to profile  <dig>  and one to profile  <dig> showing different pattern of up-regulation. it was found that  <dig> degs encode gretchenhagen- <dig>  or gh <dig> family protein. four of them were clustered to profile  <dig>  and  <dig> to profile  <dig> showing down-regulated trends. only  <dig> deg belonging to profile  <dig> was annotated to auxin-induced protein aux/iaa. in the auxin signal transduction pathway,  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs showed down-regulated trends, and  <dig> of those showed up-regulated trends, indicating that degs of the down-regulated trends in this pathway were more than those of up-regulated trends. similar results were found in the cytokinine, gibberellin, brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid signal transduction pathway. in the cytokinine signaling pathway,  <dig> unigenes encoding cytokinin receptor 1b or  <dig>  and  <dig> encoding type-a response regulator  showed down-regulated trends, while the unigene <dig> encoding histidine phosphotransfer protein  showed an up-regulated trend. in the gibberellin signal transduction pathway,  <dig> unigenes encoding gibberellic acid receptor or della protein were found to be differentially expressed, where  <dig> was identified as a down-regulated profile, and the other as up-regulated profiles. in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway,  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs showed down-regulated trends, while  <dig> showed as an up-regulated trend .figure  <dig>

in the abscisic acid signal transduction pathway,  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs were clustered to profile  <dig> or  <dig> showing up-regulated trends. they encode abscisic acid receptors pyr /pyl , type 2c protein phosphatase , snf <dig> related protein kinase  <dig> , and aba responsive element binding factor . only unigene <dig> encoding abscisic acid receptor showed a down-regulated trend. in the ethylene signal pathway,  <dig> out of  <dig> degs were also clustered to up-regulated profiles, including  <dig> unigenes encoding ethylene receptor ,  <dig> encoding ein3-binding f-box protein ,  <dig> encoding ethylene-insensitive 3b  and  <dig> encoding erf transcription factor erf1/ <dig>  only  <dig> unigenes  encoding mitogen activated protein kinase  showed down-regulated trends . these results showed that degs of the up-regulated trend in the abscisic acid and ethylene signaling pathway were much more than those of down-regulated trend, suggesting that most genes involved in these hormone signal transduction pathway were induced by ros.

expression levels of the candidate genes in response to ros
based on the kegg pathway enrichment analysis, it was found that most of the unigenes encoding the aba and ethylene signal transduction components were induced by ros. we then selected  <dig> candidate unigenes encoding these components and analyzed their expression levels during  <dig> to 10 h of ros treatment. primers of the candidate unigenes are shown in additional file  <dig>  the aba and ethylene signal transduction components are shown in additional file  <dig>  analysis of the gene expression revealed by qrt-pcr shows that genes encoding the aba signal transduction components, including the abscisic acid receptor pyr <dig>  protein phosphatase 2c, aba responsive element-binding protein  <dig> and serine/threonine-protein kinase srk2e-like isoform  <dig> increased while that of the pyl5-like decreased during  <dig> to 10 h of treatment. genes encoding the ethylene signal transduction components, including the ethylene response  <dig>  ein3-binding f-box protein  <dig>  ethylene-insensive 3b and erf transcription factor  <dig> increased while that of the mitogen-activated protein kinase decreased by the treatment .figure  <dig>

discussion
stresses induce flowering in evergreen woody fruit trees . ros act as stress signals and are recognized as important signaling components in a wide range of processes. they are generated in chloroplast and peroxisomes in the light, in mitochondria in the dark and in non-green tissues  <cit> . these signals are perceived specifically by diverse mechanisms, such as the direct redox modification of transcription factors and other proteins, resulting in the regulation of transcriptome  <cit> . our previous study showed that ros, induced by mv, promoted continuative development of panicle primordia and abortion of rudimentary leaves in leafy panicle in litchi  <cit> . to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying flowering in litchi, identifying ros responsive genes in rudimentary leaves is needed as well as those in panicle primordia. we had established an ssh library and had identified  <dig> ros responsive genes in the panicle primordia  <cit> . in the present study, we sought to identify the stress-responsive genes in the litchi rudimentary leaves. to overcome the lack of a reference litchi genome, we used rna-seq data to de novo assemble a reference transcriptome. in total, our assembly contains  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of 710 bp.  <dig>  unigenes were annotated to public protein databases. using the transcriptome as a reference, we performed deseq and identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes between un-treated  and ros-treated  rudimentary leaves.  <dig>  unigenes showed up-regulated trends and  <dig>  showed down-regulated trends from  <dig> to 10 h of treatments. compared to the  <dig> ros responsive genes identified by previous ssh experiment  <cit> , rna-seq has identified significantly more degs in the rudimentary leaf libraries.

plant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant, and occur in extremely low concentrations, but regulate a wide range of processes, including determining the formation of flowers, stems, leaves, the shedding of leaves, the development and ripening of fruit, and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. the plant hormone signals are perceived and transmitted to the nuclear by series signal transduction components to induce gene expression, resulting in a series of physiological processes. our kegg pathway enrichment analysis of the degs indicated that unigenes encoding the hormone signaling components were significantly enriched in the differentially expressed groups after mv treatment. these hormones included auxin, cytokinine, gibberellin, abscisic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroid, and jasmonic acid, suggesting that their signal components are responsive to ros. it is believed that ros signaling and redox balance is integrated with salicylic acid  signaling  <cit> . sa-signaling pathway has been proved to have a role in controlling gene expression during senescence  <cit> . though the sa-signaling pathway was not found to be significantly enriched in the ros-treated rudimentary leaves, some unigenes, such as npr <dig> and pad <dig> encoding sa-signaling components were found to be differentially expressed , suggesting that sa might also be involved in the ros-induced rudimentary leaf abortion.

abscisic acid  is an essential hormone to control plant growth, development and adaptation to environmental stresses  <cit> . we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> degs encoding abscisic acid signal components were up-regulated. the unigenes encoding pyr /pyl, pp2c, snrk <dig>  and abf were induced by mv-driven ros. our gene expression levels of the components determined by qrt-pcr were consistent with those by rna-seq, further confirming that the aba signal transduction components were ros responsive. aba is essential for abscission and senescence of aged organs. it is involved in shading-induced abscission of apple fruits  <cit> , and ethylene-associated abscission activation in citrus fruitlets  <cit> . in the present study, mv treatment induced downward growing of the rudimentary leaves, an early sign of abortion of the rudimentary leaves  <cit> . the cross-talk between aba and ros signaling is well known  <cit> , and ros is also involved in the aba-enhanced lcap <dig> expression in litchi  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in the gene expression of aba signaling components might play a role in the ros-induced abortion of litchi rudimentary leaves.

we have also identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes encoding ethylene signaling components, and  <dig> of them were up-regulated after mv-treatment. gene expression levels determined by qrt-pcr indicated that the unigenes encoding ethylene response  <dig>  ein3-binding f-box protein  <dig>  ethylene-insensive 3b and erf transcription factor  <dig> increased while that of the mitogen-activated protein kinase decreased by the ros treatment, consisting with those revealed by rna-seq. our present study suggested that the ethylene signaling transduction components were ros responsive. ethylene as a gaseous hormone is involved in a variety of plant developmental adaptations including seed germination, organ senescence, fruit ripening, abscission and stress responses  <cit> . in agricultural practice, growers often use ethephon as ethylene producer to control rudimentary leaf growth in panicles and promote continual panicle development. we found that ethylene could increase h2o <dig> levels in the rudimentary leaves  <cit> . we also showed that the petioles of rudimentary leaf displayed downward growing after mv-ros treatment , similarly to those of the ethylene-treated leaves, which is a phenomenon of epinasty, suggesting that the mv-ros could function through ethylene to induce abscission of litchi rudimentary leaves.

in arabidopsis thaliana, mv was used to study the influence of chloroplastic ros generation at the transcriptional level  <cit> . we compared our degs in response to mv with those identified by scarpeci et al.  <cit> . to our surprise, 84%  of their differentially expressed homology genes were found in our gegs data set, including genes encoding some plant hormone signaling transduction components. our study provided more information on the influence of mv generated-ros on plant transcriptome.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we reported a comprehensive litchi leaf est dataset generated by de novo assembly of next generation sequencing data. it is a valuable resource for future litchi genomic studies and will also benefit researches in other closely related species with significant agricultural importance. the differentially expressed genes dataset will also provide useful candidate genes for functional analysis of litchi flowering underlying the control of rudimentary leaf.
