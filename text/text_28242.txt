BACKGROUND
water supply limits crop productivity more than any other abiotic factor  <cit> , and the ability of plant roots to find and extract water in drying soil can determine plant reproductive success and survival. indeed, the adaptation of roots to counteract a limiting water supply is highlighted by the fact that root growth is often less sensitive to water deficit than shoot growth  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms that allow roots to grow at low water potentials  should reveal ways to manipulate drought responses and may ultimately improve tolerance.

progress in understanding the mechanisms that determine root growth at low Ψw has been made using a maize seedling system involving precise and reproducible imposition of water deficits  <cit> . root elongation rate under severe water deficit  was about 1/ <dig> the rate of growth at high Ψw   <cit> . kinematic analyses detected distinct responses of longitudinal expansion rate to low Ψw in different regions of the root growth zone  <dig> h after stress imposition when the root elongation rate was at steady state  <cit> . most striking was the complete maintenance of longitudinal expansion rate in the apical 3-mm region of roots growing at low compared to high Ψw. the adjacent, older, tissue of water-stressed roots decreased expansion rate compared to well-watered roots leading to a shortening of the growth zone.

the biophysical and biochemical bases for the altered growth rate profiles observed in water-stressed roots have been studied . progressive water deficit induces osmotic adjustment, cell wall loosening, increased aba accumulation, and membrane hyperpolarization. little is known about the genes that control these physiologically well documented processes and activities that are involved in the growth response of maize primary roots to severe water deficits. utilizing the established protocol for stress imposition, we explored the molecular responses to better understand the mechanisms which allowed growth to be maintained in the apical 3-mm but to be inhibited in adjacent older tissues. a maize oligonucleotide microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed transcripts that distinguished well-watered and water-stressed roots in different regions of the root tip in the hopes of delineating the genetic mechanisms responsible for the physiological changes that occur in water-stressed roots and identifying candidate genes that confer the varying growth responses of the different regions of the maize root elongation zone. the results extend some earlier measurements made of gene expression in this system using qrt-pcr by poroyko et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
kinematic analysis was performed on inbred line fr <dig> to ensure that the spatial profiles of longitudinal expansion rate in primary roots of seedlings growing at high and low Ψw were similar to those in the hybrid line used in earlier investigations, and, therefore, that fr <dig> could be used for genetic analysis in lieu of the hybrid. similar to the results with the hybrid, four regions of the root tip with distinctly different elongation characteristics were distinguished . in water-stressed roots, longitudinal expansion rates were the same as in well-watered roots in the apical  <dig> mm , decelerated in the subsequent  <dig> mm , and ceased in the following  <dig> mm , while in well-watered roots longitudinal expansion rates were maximal in region  <dig>  decelerated in region  <dig>  and did not cease until  <dig> mm from the apex .

three pair-wise comparisons were made of transcripts from water-stressed and well-watered tissues in the different root tip regions. in the first comparison , transcripts from region  <dig> of water-stressed seedlings were compared with those from region  <dig> of well-watered seedlings. the second comparison  was made between transcripts from region  <dig> of the two treatments. we expected a larger number of genes to be differentially expressed in region  <dig> because its elongation rate decreased greatly under water-stressed compared with well-watered conditions. to prioritize the differentially expressed genes revealed in this comparison, a distinction was made between those genes that are associated with growth inhibition in region  <dig> specifically as a response to water stress, and those genes that are involved in root cell maturation whether under stress or control conditions. a hypothetical example of the former might be genes involved in auxin response since water stress can increase maize root auxin content  <cit>  and application of exogenous auxin can shorten the root growth zone  <cit> . an example of the latter might involve genes for secondary wall synthesis  <cit> . to experimentally make this distinction a third pair-wise comparison  was included to compare expression of genes between water-stressed region  <dig> and well-watered region  <dig> as these are both regions of growth deceleration. genes differentially expressed in both c <dig> and c2/ <dig> are more likely to cause growth inhibition at low Ψw and are not likely to be part of the maturation program itself, whereas genes differentially expressed only in c <dig> are more likely related to maturation.

an overall view of expression was created for the three comparisons . using as cutoff the false discovery rate-adjusted p-value of  <dig> ,  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were identified. these represented  <dig> different ests, tentative contigs, or genomic sequences, as indicated in the gal file for the array. the transcripts were divided into either up-regulated  or down-regulated  categories except for two that changed category between comparisons. the number of affected transcripts was larger in c <dig>  than in c <dig>  , confirming earlier observations based on est libraries made from these tissues  <cit> . comparison of c <dig> and c <dig> shows that only a small minority of differentially expressed transcripts were in common:  <dig> up- and six down-regulated, totaling  <dig> % of the  <dig> transcripts in the two regions. thus, the response to water stress depended strongly on position within the root elongation zone. there was also only a small overlap between c <dig> and c2/3:  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were in common between the  <dig> up- and the  <dig> down-regulated, respectively. given our presupposition that only those genes differentially expressed in both c <dig> and c2/ <dig> are associated specifically with the stress response of region  <dig>  the majority of stress-responsive gene expression was in region  <dig>  the region that adapts to maintain elongation. accordingly, the majority of differentially expressed transcripts identified in c <dig> were likely to be involved in root maturation and not specifically in the water stress response: 75%  of the up-regulated and 80%  of the down-regulated. only  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed in all three comparisons, underscoring the fact that the response to low Ψw was largely region specific and not dominated by genes that are globally induced by water stress. real time pcr measurements confirmed the microarray results for all of  <dig> transcripts studied in region  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts studied in region  <dig> .

transcripts were divided into three groups according to their expression profiles across the three comparisons. the first group includes those transcripts that might have a primary role in the response of root growth to water stress. since elongation rates in region  <dig> were similar in well-watered and water-stressed roots, any differentially expressed transcripts in c <dig> could have a role in stress adaptation and were placed in the first group regardless of their response in c <dig> or c2/ <dig>  transcripts differentially expressed in both c <dig> and c2/ <dig> were also placed in this group. the second group includes those transcripts differentially expressed in c <dig> alone, which, as explained above, are thought to be part of the root cell maturation program. the third group includes those transcripts whose expression changed only in c2/ <dig> and these were not considered further. while they may be involved in stress response more experiments are needed to interpret their role.

at least  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially-expressed transcripts could be annotated and placed into functional categories . the distribution of expression patterns across functional categories is given in additional file  <dig>  of the functional categories identified for transcripts thought to be part of the primary stress response, reactive oxygen species  metabolism was the largest with  <dig> transcripts. this was followed by carbon metabolism , nitrogen metabolism , signaling molecules , membrane transport , transcription factors , and wall-loosening  . in each functional category these transcripts were more often up- rather than down-regulated in water-stressed compared to well-watered roots.

most differentially expressed transcripts  were found in c <dig> alone and hence are presumed to be involved in the maturation program . membrane transport  was the functional category with the greatest number and all of these were up-regulated in c <dig> . this was followed by signaling molecules , transcription factors , other dna-binding proteins , carbon metabolism , and lipid metabolism  . in each functional category in the maturation program, transcripts were more often up- rather than down-regulated under water stress.

the genes identified here have little in common with those found in an earlier study by bassani et al.  <cit>  of differentially-expressed genes in different regions of the maize primary root tip under water stress. only four of the genes found by bassani et al. had any similarity  to transcripts responding in either c <dig> or c <dig>  the differences in the two studies may be due to growth conditions; bassani et al. grew plants in the light and imposed a Ψw of - <dig>  mpa whereas plants were grown in the dark at - <dig>  mpa in our study. also, bassani et al. imposed low Ψw using a solution of polyethylene glycol  which is known to inhibit root growth by limiting oxygen supply in addition to the effects of low Ψw  <cit> .

differential expression in response to water deficit of a limited set of genes in seminal, lateral, and adventitious root tips was studied in rice by yang et al.  <cit> . while many of their reported genes had similar function to genes in our study none were orthologous to our gene set. analysis of gene expression in individual tissues has been performed previously  <cit>  in three longitudinal sections from the apex of well-watered arabidopsis roots that correspond approximately to the three segments we describe here. tentative arabidopsis orthologs  to our gene set are reported in additional file  <dig> 

in what follows selected transcripts from the group of primary stress response genes are first discussed by functional category, followed by consideration of the maturation-related genes, in order to relate their functions to known biochemical and physiological responses to water stress in the maize root tip.

ros metabolism
ros are reactive molecules that can accumulate to toxic levels with water deficit and other stresses. enzymes that metabolize ros are therefore important in preventing the damage that excess ros could cause. several transcripts for proteins that consume intracellular ros were up-regulated. a catalase  <dig> transcript was up-regulated in all three comparisons  whereas another  was up-regulated in c <dig> and c <dig>  confirming results using rtpcr  <cit> , and indicating a need to reduce excess hydrogen peroxide in both regions . several metallothionein-like transcripts were up-regulated in c <dig>  or in both c <dig> and c <dig> . metallothioneins possess superoxide-and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities  <cit> . thus, at least  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated whose proteins can decrease peroxide content of the cell interior.

legend. c <dig> refers to the region  <dig> comparison, c <dig> to the region  <dig> comparison, and c2/ <dig> to the comparison of region  <dig> of water-stressed roots with region  <dig> of well-watered roots.

some amount of ros production may be required for growth, however. for example, apoplastic ros  <cit>  and the enzymes that produce them  have been implicated in growth control via cell wall loosening. increased abundances of oxalate oxidase and peroxidase proteins, and increased levels of ros, have been detected in the apoplast of region  <dig> of the maize primary root under water-stressed conditions  <cit> . the increased expression by water stress of putative oxalate oxidase transcripts  in c <dig> and c <dig> may thus be involved in regulation of cell expansion. enhanced apoplastic peroxide content was reported in transgenic maize over-expressing a wheat oxalate oxidase  <cit> , although how the transgene affected growth in the root tip was not described. over-expression of class iii peroxidases in rice caused increased elongation of the root and root cortical cells presumably by generating peroxide  <cit> . it is unknown whether the up-regulated transcripts for class iii peroxidases in c <dig>  and in c <dig> and c2/ <dig>  also stimulate growth.

carbon metabolism
control of carbohydrate flow to the root tip is determined in part by the sucrose-hydrolyzing enzymes invertase and sucrose synthase. two distinct invertase transcripts  were down-regulated in c <dig> whereas a sucrose synthase  <dig>  transcript  was up-regulated in c <dig> and c <dig>  another susy <dig> transcript  was also up-regulated in c <dig>  susy <dig> was discovered in maize kernels deficient in the two other known sucrose synthases   <cit> , and this is the first indication of a role for this gene outside of the kernel and in a stress response. an advantage in atp consumption, phosphorous use efficiency, and in the creation of sink strength is provided by employing sucrose synthase over invertase in sucrose metabolism  <cit> .

glucose-1-phosphate  is a product of susy <dig> and is a substrate for adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , the first committed step in starch synthesis. transcripts for the large subunit of adgase  and for a putative starch synthase  were both up-regulated in c <dig> alone, suggesting increased starch synthesis which might promote carbon flow to the root tip. the tentatively orthologous rice transcript  to this adgase increased expression in response to the combination of aba and sugar  <cit> . aba also can greatly enhance the induction by sugar of the large subunit of adgase in arabidopsis  <cit> . birnbaum et al.  <cit>  reported that the tentative arabidopsis ortholog is most expressed in all tissues studied nearest the apex of the root .

transcripts coding for two activities that regulate inositol contents were differentially expressed in both c <dig> and c <dig>  transcripts for myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase  , which synthesizes myo-inositol, was up-regulated in c <dig> exclusively whereas transcripts for myo-inositol oxygenase , which catabolizes myo-inositol, were down-regulated in c <dig> and in c2/ <dig>  taken together, these results suggest a stress-induced increase in myo-inositol content which could be used for  conjugation of auxin,  as a compatible solute by itself or as a methyl ether,  in membrane lipid synthesis,  in raffinose synthesis,  in udp-sugar synthesis, and  in phytate and phosphoinositide synthesis  <cit> .

nitrogen metabolism
transcripts for a putative δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate  synthetase , which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in proline synthesis, were up-regulated in all three comparisons . transcripts for a putative proline oxidase  were down-regulated in all three comparisons . since altered metabolism in the root tip was not the main cause of proline accumulation with water stress  <cit> , these changes in expression likely act only to supplement the proline pool.

hormones
the accumulation of high concentrations of aba is required for the maintenance of elongation in water-stressed maize roots  <cit> , although these same high concentrations of aba inhibit root growth at high Ψw  <cit> . thus, the growth-inhibiting ability of aba must be diminished at low Ψw while permitting the growth-maintaining functions of aba to operate. accordingly, we hypothesized that some components of the aba response are attenuated by stress while others are not.

transcripts differentially expressed at low Ψw which may be part of the mechanism of aba action in maize root tips fell into three categories:  protein kinases,  protein phosphatase type 2c  proteins, and  transcription factors.

 a transcript  for a cipk3-like protein was down-regulated by stress in c <dig> alone . cipk <dig> is a ser/thr protein kinase involved with calcium sensing in the aba- and stress- responses of arabidopsis  <cit> , suggesting this part of the aba-signaling pathway might be suppressed in maize roots growing at low Ψw.

 three transcripts for protein phosphatase-like proteins known to restrict aba response in arabidopsis roots and other tissues were up-regulated in c <dig>  or also in c2/ <dig>  . in arabidopsis, pp2c-hab <dig>  <cit> , pp2c-hab <dig>  <cit> , and abi <dig>  <cit>  each act as negative regulators of aba response, and so perhaps attenuate root response to aba under water stress.

 two transcripts for bzip family transcription factors were up-regulated by stress. the first  represents trab <dig>  a transcription factor that interacts with the osvp <dig> protein to induce gene expression in rice  <cit> , which increased in c <dig> and in c2/ <dig>  rice trab <dig> is expressed in roots and is inducible by aba  <cit> .

the second transcript is for an arabidopsis aba-response element-binding protein  , which exhibited increased expression in c <dig>  rice plants over-expressing osdreb1a, a rice homolog of abf <dig>  displayed retarded growth and increased proline and sugar content when grown under normal conditions. they also demonstrated improved recovery from water deprivation  <cit> .

some potentially aba-inducible transcripts were already mentioned. in addition, a maize dehydrin up-regulated in c <dig> and c2/ <dig>  and a second up-regulated in c <dig> alone  were tentative orthologs of the rice lip <dig> dehydrin. lip <dig> was up-regulated in the osdreb1a over-expressing plants mentioned above  <cit>  and in response to aba and drought in rice  <cit> . dehydrins are expected to help protect cells from stress.

water-stress can increase auxin levels in maize root tips  <cit>  and exogenous auxin can shorten the elongation zone while promoting growth in the apical region of cereal roots  <cit> . this suggests that auxin may play a role in root growth at low Ψw. a transcript  for a putative sinat <dig>  a ubiquitin protein ligase, was up-regulated by stress in c <dig>  sinat <dig> expression is enhanced by auxin in root tips of arabidopsis  <cit>  and increased expression of sinat <dig> protein in transgenic arabidopsis promoted root elongation  <cit> . thus, the sinat5-like gene product may act to maintain cell elongation in region  <dig> of water-stressed maize primary roots.

the up-regulation in c <dig> of a transcript similar to a 23-kd jasmonate-induced thionin  suggests some action of jasmonates due to stress. thionins are involved in plant defenses to biotic factors  <cit> . jasmonates are also able to induce some genes of the jacalin family of lectins which are associated with defense responses. a transcript for a jacalin-like protein was up-regulated in c <dig> .

in previous studies, some of the response to endogenous aba in roots at low Ψw was attributed to its ability to prevent synthesis of excess ethylene, which otherwise would inhibit root elongation and promote radial swelling  <cit> . a transcript  for an ethylene-binding-like protein was down-regulated in c <dig>  reduced ability to bind ethylene should make the root less sensitive to ethylene, perhaps influencing root shape. it is noteworthy that maize primary roots are thinner at low compared to high Ψw  <cit> .

wall loosening proteins
the increased wall extensibility in region  <dig> of water-stressed roots  <cit>  may be due to increased activity of cell wall loosening proteins. increased activity of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase  was reported in region  <dig> of water-stressed roots, and was shown to be aba-dependent  <cit> . a transcript for xet  was up-regulated in c <dig>  but not in c <dig> where the enzyme activity increases  <cit> . this suggests that the increased enzyme activity in region  <dig> was due to post-transcriptional events.

expansins are also associated with increased wall-loosening in water-stressed maize root tips  <cit> . two transcripts for α-expansins  were up-regulated in c <dig>  while β-expansins  were up-regulated in c <dig> and c2/ <dig>  these data confirm previous measures of increased expression of α-expansin genes and expb <dig> in stressed maize root tips  <cit> . it is unclear what role β-expansins play in the regulation of growth in region  <dig> at low Ψw, in which elongation was inhibited, as they are able to loosen walls  <cit> .

the major hemicellulose class of the maize primary cell wall is composed of mixed linkage β-glucans which are believed to be cleaved by endo- <dig> ; <dig> -beta-d-glucanases to cause wall loosening  <cit> . a transcript for a putative endo- <dig> ; <dig> -beta-d-glucanase was up-regulated in c <dig>  and an endo- <dig> ; <dig> -beta-d-glucanase was identified in the maize primary root elongation zone in a cell wall proteomic study of well-watered roots  <cit> . more recently, however, a comprehensive study on root region specific cell wall protein profiles showed decreased abundance of two endo- <dig> ; <dig> -beta-d-glucanases in region  <dig> under water deficit conditions  <cit> . these observations suggest that changes at the transcript level for this particular member may not be reflected at the translational level, or that members of this gene family may have different subcellular localizations  <cit> .

membrane transport
ober and sharp  <cit>  reported that maize root tip cortical cell membranes are hyperpolarized by stress and that the hyperpolarization requires increased h+-atpase activity of the plasma membrane. potassium and chloride ions are also important for the hyperpolarization. when aba is prevented from accumulating the membrane becomes more hyperpolarized in the apical 2- to 3-mm, suggesting that aba acts on ion transport or transporters in the regulation of growth. we hypothesized that changes in expression of genes for such transporters occur in this region. two putative anion transporters were up-regulated in all three comparisons  and a third in c <dig> and c <dig>  which might serve this function .

two transcripts coding for proteins with similarity to mate efflux family proteins were increased in c <dig>  and a third in both c <dig> and c <dig> . the functions of only a few mate proteins are known  <cit>  although some respond to phosphate-  <cit>  or iron-deficiency  <cit> , conditions which may accompany water stress. a transcript for a putative amino acid transporter  was up-regulated in c <dig> and c <dig> as was one for a sugar transport family protein , possibly in response to enhanced nutritional requirements. a transcript for an oligopeptide transporter-like gene  was increased in c <dig>  although no functional characterization is available  <cit> .

root maturation-related genes
transcripts were indentified that were presumed to be related to tissue maturation in region  <dig> of stressed roots and in region  <dig> of control roots and not directly responsive to water stress. such genes might function in cell-wall thickening, vascular differentiation, and increased resistance to water and solute transport, among other processes. some pertinent transcripts are listed in table  <dig> 

legend. c <dig> refers to the region  <dig> comparison, c <dig> to the region  <dig> comparison, and c2/ <dig> to the comparison of region  <dig> of water-stressed roots with region  <dig> of well-watered roots.

inositol phosphates such as inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate   <cit>  and inositol hexakisphosphate   <cit>  have roles in intracellular signaling. inositol 5-phosphatase can decrease content of ip <dig> and in arabidopsis it is induced by aba  <cit> . phytase dephosphorylates phytate. phytate is synthesized in maize roots  <cit>  and phytase mrna and protein have been localized in the pericycle, endodermis, and rhizodermis of maize root tips  <cit> . transcripts for enzymes that could metabolize inositol phosphates, one for inositol 5-phosphatase  and two for phytase , were up-regulated by stress in c <dig>  little is known about the role of inositol phosphate signaling in root development or its response to water stress.

poroyko et al.  <cit>  found that transcripts for inorganic ion and water transport and metabolism were generally up-regulated in region  <dig>  we found some  <dig> transcripts whose functions are related to membrane transport were up-regulated in c <dig> alone. cells in the more mature region of the expanding root tip have decreased symplastic continuity with the phloem  <cit> . as a consequence solutes and water must traverse more membranes to be taken up by cells. many of these transporters may be part of that response. for example, it is expected that increased uptake from the apoplast of sugars and amino acids is required, and consistent with this idea several putative sugar and amino acid transporters were up-regulated. the differential regulation of several sulfate transporters was notable since sulfate content increases in the xylem of more mature maize plants of this genotype under water stress conditions  <cit> . transcripts for abc transporters were identified as well, belonging to the epd family that is not yet well described in plants  <cit> .

expression increased in c <dig> alone for three o-methyl transferase transcripts . these may be involved in creating phenylpropanoid precursors to lignin and suberin whose contents increase in mature roots  <cit> .

up-regulated transcripts for ga metabolism  and response  were identified in c <dig>  the arabidopsis tentative ortholog was also most expressed in tissues of this region of the root apex . a role for ga in root cell growth was previously indicated by the altered pattern of radial swelling observed in ga-deficient maize seedlings  <cit> .

promoter analysis
the regulatory mechanisms of genes are mostly controlled by the binding of transcription factors to the sites located upstream of coding regions. possible transcription factor binding sites  of the differentially expressed genes found in this study were sought. promoter regions were defined as the  <dig>  bases upstream of the coding regions of full sequence gene models for maize , or for tentatively orthologous rice and arabidopsis genes. cis elements were identified in the promoters of  <dig> maize genes or their tentative orthologs using the place database. while  <dig> classes of cis elements were detected  there was little difference in their distribution between sequences that belonged to the primary or maturation classes of transcripts, and hierarchical clustering techniques did not reveal any associations with specific expression patterns .

CONCLUSIONS
we explored gene expression in the maize primary root to identify causes for the changes observed in the spatial pattern of root elongation at low Ψw. the two regions of the root studied showed distinctly different transcript profiles underscoring the importance of spatial analysis. within region  <dig>  where longitudinal expansion rate is maintained during stress, all differentially expressed transcripts were considered to be part of the mechanism of adaptation to stress. within region  <dig>  the region where longitudinal expansion decreases from the maximal control rate to a progressively slower rate under stress, transcripts were divided into two groups: those that were part of the stress response that brought about early root cell maturation, and those that were part of maturation itself. region  <dig> contained a greater number of differentially expressed genes involved in the stress response than did region  <dig>  even though region  <dig> had the greater total number of differentially expressed genes. this result was expected given the maintenance of elongation in region  <dig> and its inhibition in region  <dig> of water-stressed roots.

our results support and add molecular details to the model of root growth maintenance under stress via increased wall loosening in region  <dig>  osmotic adjustment, regulation by aba, and changes in membrane transport. the data suggest a need for control of intracellular ros content by catalase and metallothioneins and for apoplastic hydrogen peroxide production by oxalate oxidase and other cell wall proteins to cause wall loosening. a transcript with similarity to a mixed linkage β-glucanase suggests a role for this enzyme in stress adaptation in the root growth zone. carbohydrate metabolism appears altered at the transcript level to involve roles for susy <dig> and enhanced starch synthesis. the mechanism of osmotic adjustment by proline accumulation was extended to include changes in expression of genes for proline metabolism. altered expression of transcripts similar to known members of the aba signaling pathway suggest some parts of the aba response network are attenuated while others are not, which may explain how the stressed root tolerates, and requires, high endogenous levels of this hormone. the stress-enhanced expression of a sinat5-like transcript may link auxin to growth maintenance in region  <dig>  change in an ethylene-binding like protein is suggested to help control the shape of the stressed root. evidence for jasmonate-induced gene expression was also indicated that is probably related to biotic stress defense. the up-regulated transcripts for membrane anion transport may bring about the known stress-induced changes in membrane potential. together the data show that the regulation of root growth at low water potentials involves region-specific changes in many different aspects of cell metabolism, signaling, and transport.
