BACKGROUND
the genus prosopis linnaeus emend burkart, a member of the subfamily mimosoideae within the family fabaceae, comprises  <dig> species divided into  <dig> sections: prosopis, anonychium, strombocarpa, monilicarpa and algarobia <cit> . this genus is spread around the world in arid and semiarid regions, including north and south america, north and central africa, near east and the caribbean region. the main center of diversity for prosopis genus is located in argentina  <cit>  with  <dig> species. of these species,  <dig> belonging to algarobia section  <cit> , which are distributed in the phytogeographic provinces of chaco, monte, and espinal  <cit> . they cover over one million square kilometers, which represents approximately one third of the total country area  <cit> .

one of the most important features of this genus is its natural capacity to produce fertile interspecific hybrids  <cit> . this generates a syngameon complex integrated by species and subspecies which form a continuum  <cit> . this complex includes six taxonomic species that play a significant role in argentina: p. alba, p. hassleri, p. nigra, p. ruscifolia, p. chilensis and p. flexuosa.

the members of this complex develop deep roots that give these plants several advantaged. for instance, these deep roots reduce competition for water with herbaceous species, improve water balance of the system, provide nutrients to the subsurface layers and in some cases make the plants fairly independent of rainfall  <cit> .

their fruits are pods and may contain large amounts of sugar and protein which offer optimal energy for its use as fodder and for human consumption. they can also be used for firewood and charcoal, as well as for other products   <cit> . also, “algarrobos” can be an alternative of livestock-forestry systems  <cit> .

within this group of “algarrobos”, p. alba known as "white algarrobo" displays the widest geographical distribution. this species grows in areas under average annual precipitations of  <dig> to  <dig> mm, which are summer dominant, with extreme temperatures between 48°c maximal absolute, up to −10°c absolute minimum  <cit> . p. alba comprises groups with different morphological characteristics, such as variations in leaves and fruits, and inhabits different ecological zones  <cit> . also, these morphological groups have distinct adaptation mechanisms to drought stress  <cit> .

in argentina, this native species is mainly used for saw timber  and the whole wood consumed comes from the native forests in “parque chaqueño”   <cit> .

besides, all “algarrobos”, including p. alba, may play a role on the recovery of degraded ecosystem  <cit> ; hence re-population with these species generates favourable conditions for natural recovery of the whole ecosystem.

up to date, few genomic data exist on prosopis genus. a total of  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  from prosopis juliflora has been deposited in the ncbi est database  <cit> . there are also a limited number of molecular markers published: six microsatellites isolated from prosopis chilensis <cit>  and  <dig> from a bulk sample of american algarrobos introduced to australia  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, here we report the largest contribution to sequence information of prosopis spp. generated through new generation sequencing technologies. the results from the assembly and functional annotation of p. alba leaf transcriptome are presented, along with ssr and snp motif mining. nuclear and chloroplast ssr and snp were discriminated in the analysis. finally, this work generated a collection of  <dig> nuclear-ssr primer pairs validated for its application to diversity studies in p. alba and another set of  <dig> nuclear polymorphic ssrs determined in silico, of which 50% have the probability of being effectively polymorphic. the overall workflow of the project is represented in the additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
an rna-seq from a leaf bulk sample of three different individuals was performed using  <dig> gs flx titanium technology . the use of rna-seq generated  <dig> mb of sequence data from  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of  <dig> bp, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the sequences were subjected to filtering for adaptors, primer sequences and low-quality sequences. after this filtering,  <dig>  reads were removed resulting in  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads . de novo transcriptome assembly was performed using newbler software v.  <dig>  . with this assembly,  <dig>  full length reads  and  <dig>  partial number of reads  were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs  with an average length of  <dig> bp, ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp and n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp . in addition, the isotigs originated from the same contig-graph were grouped into  <dig>  isogroups. these isogroups are equivalent to genomic loci  with an average of  <dig>  transcripts per locus, which potentially reflect multiple splicing variants. most of the isogroups  had only one isotig each. a total of  <dig>  reads  did not assemble into isotigs; therefore they were singletons. these singletons had an average length of  <dig> bp  and,  <dig>  of these singletons  were shorter than  <dig> bp. all singletons were clustered using cd-hit- <dig> algorithm to eliminate artificial duplicates. after clustering, we obtained  <dig>  unique singletons longer than  <dig> bp. then, all unigenes  were kept for further analysis . the average length of p. alba isotigs was larger than those assembled in other native tree species nothofagus nervosa, which had an average length of  <dig> bp  <cit> . the average length found in the present research was also larger than those of other non-model organisms ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <cit> . this can be explained because of the use of the new  <dig> gs flx titanium  run that probably allowed us to obtain better and longer reads. isotigs were integrated by different number of sub-contigs generated in the assembly process. these isotigs were integrated by  <dig> to  <dig> contigs with an average of  <dig> contigs assembled into each isotig. these results are similar to the average numbers obtained in the  <dig> n. nervosa transcriptome analyses   <cit>  and larger than other  <dig> transcriptome analyses , such as those of pinus contorta and microalgae dunaliella tertiolecta <cit> .

number and percentages of  <dig> sequences in the assembled isotigs, singletons and total unigenes  with significant matches against a viridiplantae protein database.

functional annotation
for assigning putative functions to the p. alba´s transcriptome, blastx searches  <cit>  were performed aligning the assembled sequences to the  <dig> , <dig> protein sequences from a custom-made viridiplantae database. a total of  <dig>  isotigs and  <dig>  singletons showed significant blastx matches  . a higher percentage of isotigs  than singletons  had blastx hits, probably due to the good quality of isotigs , short lengths of singletons and the high e-value cut-off applied. previous reports on de novo transcriptome assemblies of eukaryotes described lower percentage of isotigs, ranging from  <dig> to 40%, such as those described for lanville fritillary butterfly, a coral larval, lodgepole pine and microalgae  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  unique sequences had at least one blast hit in the search, while the  <dig>  remaining sequences   were orphans. however, these orphan sequences may still be informative for identifying putative biological functions which may be considered as p .alba specific.

after the analyses of seven completely sequenced genomes, the average number of genes encoded in a plant nuclear genome was estimated in approximately  <dig> thousands  <cit> . our annotated dataset with  <dig>  isogroups, which can be used to estimate the number of gene locus, and  <dig>  unique singletons most likely represent a good proportion of the p. alba gene catalogue.

blastx hits and top hits in terms of the total number of hits to all unigenes were mostly found with glycine max , vitis vinifera and medicago truncatula .

gene ontology  term annotation and metabolic pathway mapping
using a full local installation of blast2go  <cit>  and the interproscan suite  <cit> , we retrieved gene ontology  terms and enzyme commission numbers  for the p. alba unigenes .

from the blast2go and interproscan programs, a total of  <dig>  go terms were assigned to  <dig>  unigenes . among all the go terms extracted,  <dig>   belong to the biological process class,  <dig>   fit the molecular function class and  <dig>   belong to the cellular component class.

the “biological process”  go category comprises different types of metabolic processes, which in turn are the most represented subcategories. indeed, there are  <dig>  sequences associated with metabolic processes  and  <dig>  sequences related to cellular processes. these results may indicate that the analysed tissues were undergoing extensive metabolic activities  <cit> . these findings were expected, since the metabolic network in plants is very extensive compared to other organisms  <cit> . within the sequences associated with biological processes, we found go terms associated with primary and secondary metabolism. in this respect, the primary metabolites are known to be essential for plant survival and the secondary metabolites are described as playing roles in plant protection. several genes involved in other important biological processes were also identified . among these genes, we can mention the ones associated with cellular processes, establishment of localization, biological regulation, biogenesis, developmental processes and signalling, to name a few. another category worth mentioning is “response to stimulus” . we found  <dig>  sequences in association with this category, which includes candidate genes involved in the resistance to biotic and abiotic stimulus.

in terms of molecular function, the top three go terms found were related to the following categories: binding  <dig>  , catalytic activities,  <dig>   and transporters  <dig>   .

a detailed analysis  at the cellular component category sorted all transcripts from p. alba into  <dig> groups. of these groups, the most representative categories were: cell , organelle  and macromolecular complex component  .

of the  <dig>  sequences annotated with go terms,  <dig>  were assigned with ec numbers  .

figure  <dig> displays the most represented enzymes in all sequences: transferase activity , hydrolase activity  and oxidoreductase activity . the large number of annotated enzymes within these three groups suggests the presence of genes associated to pathways of secondary metabolite synthesis  <cit> .
p. alba 
unigenes.

to further enhance the annotation of the transcriptome dataset, all genes with go terms were mapped to metabolic pathways using kegg automatic annotation server   <cit> . from this analysis,  <dig> unique enzymes commission  numbers were assigned to  <dig>  genes, of which  <dig> unique enzymes were assigned to  <dig> metabolic pathways  .
p. alba


٭kegg: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.

this table shows the kegg metabolic pathways of plants that were well represented by unique sequences of prosopis alba. the numbers of unigenes involved are described.

regarding the analysis using kaas, we found  <dig> transcripts involved in purine metabolism. this metabolic pathway is of fundamental importance in the growth and development of plants  <cit> . for instance, purine is involved in building blocks for nucleic acid synthesis and is also an energy source, as well as a precursor for the synthesis of primary products and secondary products  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> genes associated with thiamine metabolism were detected. these genes are of particular interest to the prosopis genus since the thiamine metabolism is involved in abiotic stress response through the ca2+ salicylic acid and related signaling pathways  <cit> .

when the metabolic pathways from p. alba was compared with other tree species , we were able to observe  <dig> shared pathways. from these pathways,  <dig> were differential from prosopis and  <dig> from nothofagus .

assessment of leaf transcriptome assembly
for the assessment of the quality and completeness of the p alba transcriptome, a pair-wise reciprocal blastp was performed using the gene catalogues from m. truncatula, g. max and our p alba unigene dataset. all protein-coding loci were translated into their correct amino acid sequences and a blastp analysis was performed using the default parameters and an e-value cut-off of  <dig>  sequences that were the reciprocal best hits among all  <dig> species were considered as the orthologue set and, taking this into account,  <dig> prosopis unigenes fell in this category. for the following analysis, the same strategy was followed but the comparison was carried out just between two species. the comparisons were performed with two legumes that have a complete genome assembly, m. truncatula and g. max. the results of these comparisons showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from p. alba when compared to m. truncatula and g. max respectively. as test of the stringency of our strategy, we compared m. truncatula and g. max with each other and obtained a set of  <dig>  orthologues as approximately expected with this strategy. in addition, to evaluate the distribution of all the p. alba isotigs along the eight chromosomes of m. truncatula and the  <dig> chromosomes of g. max, a protein-protein analysis was performed with “promer”. this program translates all sequences into its six-open reading frames and makes an alignment  <cit> . the results of this analysis were plotted using a window size of 100kb through their genomic sequences . transposon and gene densities in each species were distributed along all chromosomes of m. truncatula and g. max. as expected, in g. max, sequences of genes were most distributed in chromosome regions with low density of transposons. genes belonging to p. alba distributed along all chromosomes in both species . however, sequences of genes were less represented in chromosome  <dig> of m. truncatula. this could also be seen in the central green lines  that show the distribution of the  <dig>  unigene homologous to g. max, p. alba and m. truncatula altogether.

again, chromosome  <dig> of m. truncatula had fewer mrna sequences homologous to g. max as well as with p. alba. when comparing m. truncatula genome with lotus japonica <cit> , similar results were obtained. these findings demonstrate the lack of marker-based synteny with pea  <cit>  and the abundance of nucleotide-binding site-leu-rich repeat genes  <cit> . the unusual high proportion of heterochromatin in this chromosome as it was previously reported  <cit>  may explain why we found less homologous mrna sequences in chromosome  <dig> of m. truncatula.

snp detection
single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified through the analysis of the multiple alignments produced during the assembly process. the criterion for this analysis was reducing the probability of false positive identification .

the analysis of  <dig>  isotigs resulted in the identification of  <dig>  putative snps. after applying filters, we obtained a total of  <dig>  high confidence snps from  <dig>  isotigs . of these snps,  <dig> belonged to  <dig> chloroplast isotig and  <dig> contig sequences . the  <dig>  isotigs that were mined for snps identification comprised  <dig>  kb of p. alba transcriptome, with  <dig> snp per  <dig>  bases on average. the snps density in “algarrobo” was similar to that found in capsicum annuum trancriptome   <cit> . in both cases the criteria to identified snps and the number of individual analysed were analogous. however, in oak  <cit>  and in eucalyptus grandis <cit>  the snp frequency was much higher than in p. alba, . these differences can mainly be attributed to the number of individuals that were sequenced in the other forest species . within the identified snps, transitions  were far more frequent than transversions  . a similar number of a/g and c/t transitions together with equivalent values of the four transversion categories  were found. these results are in accordance with the findings described in cucurbita pepo snps  <cit> .

class and number of transitions and transversions are shown for putative high quality single nucleotide polymorphism  identified in p. alba transcriptome.

single sequence repeats  detection
using the ssr webserver from the genome database for rosaceae , we identified and characterized several ssrs  motifs as potential molecular markers in the prosopis putative unigenes collection generated in this work.

the criterion used for the ssr selection was based on the minimum number of repeats . these settings resulted in the identification of  <dig>  nuclear ssrs within  <dig>  unigenes, i.e. ssr frequency of 11% taking into account multiple repeat occurrences in a same unique locus. this frequency was comparable to that reported in nothofagus   <cit>  and lower than in oak   <cit> . a total of  <dig>   nuclear unigenes contained at least one ssr, suggesting that they are distributed throughout the whole leaf transcriptome. additionally,  <dig>  ssrs  had sufficient flanking sequences to allow the design of appropriate unique primers to generate pcr products within the range of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. detailed information of the ssrs that were discovered in this research is described in additional file  <dig> 

as expected, the most frequent type of microsatellite corresponded to trimeric repeats , while much lower frequencies were found for dimeric motifs , tetra- , penta-  and hexanucleotide repeats  . similar results were found in nothofagus and oak  <cit> .

seventy two percent of the sequences had only one ssr  and  <dig> % had two. of the unique ssr, 44% were of trimeric motif followed by 28% of di- and 19% of tetranucleotide motifs. the ssrs were highly distributed over the sequences; which provides a useful tool for different genetic studies .

the topography of ssr distribution was analyzed for the presence of ssr within predicted utrs and coding sequence regions . about 44% of the ssr sequences were inside orf sequences, being most of them trinucleotide and hexanucleotides repeats . in the utrs, the dinucleotides motifs were more frequent  comparable to those reported in other trees such as oak   <cit> , nothofagus   <cit>  and pines   <cit> .

eighty one percent of the repeated sequences found in orf had a combination of length motif and repeat number multiple of three,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  3) which did not modify the reading frame, . this could be explained on the basis of the selective disadvantage of non-trimeric ssr variants in coding regions, possibly causing frame-shift mutations  <cit> .

finally, we also identified ssrs belonging to gene families associated with the production of cellulose, the lignin biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  and with transcription factors. as for the production of cellulose, we detected genes such as cellulose synthases , glycosyl transferases and sucrose synthase. the identified genes related to the lignin biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  were cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase as well as cinnamoyl reductase-like protein. from the genes associated with transcription factors, zinc finger proteins and some anti-oxidants  were identified. stress related sequences such as heat shock proteins and zeaxanthin epoxidase were also identified in the reference p. alba transcriptome, interestingly, zeaxanthin epoxidase is a precursor of abscisic acid  that is involved in response to abiotic stress, including tolerance to heavy metals.

validation of the predicted microsatellite markers
eighty seven microsatellites were selected according to their sequence length, gc content and functional annotation. as for functional annotation, we selected those related to the following categories: stress, calcium metabolism, peroxidases, myb and zinc finger proteins, among other putative functions . the  <dig> loci were tested for pcr amplification in six individuals. all of them  were effectively amplified validating the quality of the assembly and the utility of the ssrs herein identified. similar results were obtained in nothofagus by applying the same strategy for the assembly and the in silico searches for ssrs. similar research carried out using illumina sequencing technology in sesame showed that about 90% primer pairs successfully amplified dna fragments  <cit> . however, the rate of ssr validation was lower  when the marker mining was done using est produced by sanger technology  <cit> , possibly because of the low-quality of the est sequences. the lower rate could also be explained by the use of primer sequences derived from chimerical cdna clones.

about 15%  of the tested prosopis ssrs were polymorphic and showed at least one individual differing in allelic composition, belonging to  <dig> different loci positions ie: three ssrs belonged to the same isotig  <dig>  this relative low percentage of polymorphic loci could be due to the small sample size tested , the selected target loci  and their presence in predicted orf. the percentage was slightly lower than that of a similar study in nothofagus . furthermore, even higher percentages of polymorphism were identified in other reports: 30% in phoenix dactylifera l date palm   <cit> , 46% in e. globulus   <cit>  and 80% in sesame   <cit> . five of the polymorphic ssrs found in this work were located within predicted orf and showed repeat motifs multiple of three , therefore maintaining the coding region in frame  <cit> .
p. alba 
unigenes

the included data are: primer names, marker id names, motif and number of repeats, position in orf, forward and reverse primer sequences , amplicon length , blastx similarity matches .

polymorphic ssr predicted
from the  <dig>  nuclear ssrs detected in contigs/isotigs , a total of  <dig>   had defined primers for pcr reactions, belonging to  <dig>  different isogroups .

in order to predict nuclear polymorphic ssrs, we carried out in silico pcr for each of the sequences from the different contigs/isotigs. for this purpose, all  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads were used. to achieve a higher success rate, another set of primers was also were designed closer to the ssr motifs in order to capture short length reads included in contigs.

at least  <dig> nuclear polymorphic ssrs were detected by pcr in silico; which only includes isotigs integrated by three or more reads and whose product size generated by in silico pcr differed in at least two base length . an apparent underestimation of nuclear polymorphisms in silico was observed when considering that from the  <dig> clear polymorphic ssrs coming from isotigs , of which, only two of them  resulted polymorphic under the criteria used in silico. however, from the  <dig> ssrs that were amplified in vitro,  <dig> belonged to isotigs and only six had enough reads to be considered in this in silico analysis; which resulted in only three effectively polymorphic ssrs in silico . therefore, it can be predicted that  <dig> ssrs out of the  <dig> new ssrs that were detected in silico will be effectively polymorphic in vitro. this result could be an interesting survey of potential useful ssrs and could contribute significantly to the ssrs available in other reports  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> go terms were allocated to the  <dig> nuclear isogroups containing the polymorphic ssrs that were identified in silico in this research. they were assigned under the categories “biological process” , “molecular function” , and “cellular component” . the most represented subcategories assigned under “biological process” at third-level terms were: “primary metabolic process” , “cellular metabolic process”  and “macromolecule metabolic process” . in addition, many of the terms that classified as “molecular function” were represented by genes in the following subcategories: “hydrolase activity” , “nucleic binding” , “ion binding”  and “protein binding” . in addition, seven metabolic pathways were represented by at least one sequence, with its corresponding ec number. this makes these functional markers especially useful for population and evolution analyses of p. alba.

chloroplasts mining
we detected  <dig>  chloroplast reads through alignment analyses to related chloroplast  sequences. after an alignment analysis with the legume vigna radiata chloroplast genome,  <dig> contigs composed of  <dig>  bp were generated, spanning a total of  <dig>  bp that belong to the prosopis cp genome. the chloroplast reads of p. alba with  <dig>  bp represented ~ <dig> % of the total cp genome of v. radiata   <cit> . there were  <dig> intra scaffold gaps in p. alba cp genome with a mean sequence gap size of  <dig> bp.

a total of  <dig> isogroups harboring  <dig> ssrs were also found:  <dig> with designed primers,  <dig> with different blastx hits related to chloroplast metabolism  and four polymorphic in silico . chloroplast ssrs were previously described in several plants such as pinus radiata, oryza sativa, nicotiana <cit> . more recently several other organisms were also characterized for these ssrs: eucalyptus globulus, g. max, v. radiata, m. truncatula, v. vinifera among others. all of these chloroplast ssrs have been deposited in a data base http://www.mcr.org.in/chloromitossrdb/ <cit> . also, in rice around  <dig> % of the chloroplast genome has been covered by ssrs  <cit> .

methods
rna preparation and cdna library synthesis
total rna was extracted from leaves of seedling collected from natural populations of p.alba from different provinces of argentina: population  <dig> from campo durán , population  <dig> from isla cuba  and population  <dig> from chañar bajada 

the rna extraction method used in this research is the one described by chang el al,   <cit> . briefly, one gram of fresh tissue was ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen. then, after two extractions with chloroform, the rna was precipitated with licl <dig>  extracted again with chloroform and finally precipitated with ethanol. the resultant rna was resuspended in  <dig> μl of depc treated water. the rna was quantified using a nanodrop  <dig>  spectrophotometer and its quality was measured with a  <dig>  bioanalyzer . then, it was subjected to purification using the poly  purist kit  and its quality was once more assessed with the  <dig>  bioanalyzer. cdna was synthesized using cdna kit  and used to construct a shotgun library for pyrosequencing technology . the prosopis cdna library was subjected to a 1/ <dig> of plate production run on the 454-gs-flx sequencing instrument. this run was conducted at indear .

transcript assembly and analysis
the sequences were subjected to filtering for adaptors, primer sequences and low-quality sequences after removing the low quality sequences, the curated raw  <dig> read sequences were assembled into contigs, isotigs and isogroups using newbler assembler software  <dig> p <dig> . the reads identified like singletons  after assembly were subjected to cd-hit- <dig> clustering algorithm at 95% identity cutoff, which eliminates redundant sequences  <cit> .

blastx  searches were performed against a viridiplantae protein database first. then, the sequences with no hits were used to perform a successive blastx against the ncbi nr protein database in order to make an assessment of the putative identities of the sequences. unigenes  were deposited at the national centre for biotechnology information  transcriptome shotgun assembly  database under bioproject:  <dig> tsa- sub <dig> 

annotation and mapping routines were run with blast2go  <cit> , which assigns gene ontology  annotation, kegg maps  and an enzyme classification number  using a combination of similarity searches and statistical analysis  <cit> . in addition to blast2go, the full suite of interproscan was ran with default parameters. interproscan combines different protein signature recognition methods native to the interpro member databases into one resource that searches for the corresponding interpro and go annotations.

chloroplast assembly analysis was carried out using amoscmp  <cit> . to search for chloroplast sequences, blastn and tblastx  were performed. the analysis was based on similarity with and without translation to  <dig> chloroplast genomes .

comparative genomics
circos software tool  <cit>  was used to visualize p. alba sequences with m. truncatula and g. max´s genomes, through circular concentric ideograms layout to facilitate the display data as scatter, line and histogram plots for each different sample. promer analysis was performed and filtered by using a window size of 100kb through their genome sequences. homologous sequences for the three species were determined when reciprocal tblastx best hits were found for the three “genes” tested.

snp identification
in order to perform matching, alignment of dna sequences and searching for putative snps, the ssahasnp program  was used  <cit> . the criterion designed to reduce the probability of false positive identification was that the minority allele  should be found in at least  <dig> sequences and that at least the 10% of reads had an snp from total coverage, which should be at least 8x.

ssr identification
in order to identify ssrs for all possible combinations of dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide repeats, we performed a run using the ssr webserver  . this webserver uses the getorf algorithm  and selects the longest orf as the putative coding region. this webserver also uses primer  <dig>   <cit>  to design primer pairs. the criteria used for the ssr selection based on the minimum number of repeats was as follows: five for dinucleotide, four for trinucleotide, three for tetranucleotide and three for penta and hexanucleotide motives.

the presence of expressed repetitive dna was revealed using the blastn  searches against all viridiplantae repbase.

ssr validation
for validation of ssr primers, total dna was extracted from young leaves of six prosopis alba seedlings from three native populations described previously . for dna extraction, the dneasy plant mini kit  was used following the manufacturer´s instructions. regular primers were synthesized  and used for pcr  amplification. pcr reactions consisted of  <dig> ng of total dna,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> mm of mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm of each dntp, 1x of pcr buffer and  <dig> u of platinum taq polymerase . all pcrs were performed with the following conditions: a denaturation step of  <dig> min at 94°c, a regular touchdown pcr ranging from 60°c to 50°c with  <dig> cycles at the touchdown temperature of 50°c . the final extension step was of  <dig> min at 72°c and then the temperature conditions were adjusted for each particular microsatellite. samples were mixed with denaturing loading buffer, incubated for  <dig> min at 95°c, and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. amplification products were stained using the dna silver staining procedure of promega  following the manufacturer’s instructions. details of primers sequences, ssr location and amplicon sizes are described in table  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the p.alba transcriptome database obtained and characterized here represents a major contribution for prosopis sp. genomics and genetics. it will be useful for discovering genes of interest and genetic markers, which could allow to investigate functional diversity in natural populations. these tools will also lead to conduct comparative genomics studies with other prosopis species taking advantage of their remarkable ecophysiological differences. this work highlights the utility of transcriptome high performance sequencing as a fast and cost effective way for obtaining rapid information on the coding of genetic variation in prosopis genus. this study allowed us to:  obtain  <dig> , <dig> transcript raw reads and  <dig>  unigene sequences from p.alba,  identify putative function in  <dig>  unigenes for the genus,  identify  <dig> putative stress-response genes,  discover  <dig>  genomic ssrs with designed primers, validate  <dig> and detect  <dig> polymorphic ssrs, several of them related to response to stress,  identify probably  <dig> effectively polymorphic after in silico analysis, and  identify  <dig>  higher confidence nuclear snps, some of them related to the production of cellulose, together with the lignin biosynthetic pathway and with stress, among others.
