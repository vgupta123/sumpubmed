BACKGROUND
transposable elements   <cit>  are grouped into retrotransposons and dna transposons, depending upon whether or not rna intermediates are required for transposition. simple dna transposons such as insertion sequences  encode a transposase and have an inverted repeat of usually 9– <dig> bp at each end  <cit> . composite dna transposons found in bacteria such as tn <dig>  tn <dig>  and tn <dig> contain a middle region  flanked by two is elements. owing to these flanking is elements, the middle region of a composite dna transposon becomes mobile as well. retrotransposons can be divided further into two groups: one with a long terminal repeat  of a few hundred to over  <dig> kb long at each end  and the other without ltrs   <cit> . retroviruses and lines encode reverse transcriptases that are essential for their amplification in the genome. in most cases, insertion of either a dna transposon or a retrotransposon results in target site duplication  of usually 2– <dig> bp  <cit> . while composite dna transposons such as those in the tn family have been known for quite some time, a composite retrotransposon with a similar architecture has yet to be discovered.

the human genome contains significantly more recognizable retrotransposons  than dna transposons   <cit> . the already identified retrotransposons include ltr elements such as human endogenous retroviruses , as well as non-ltr elements such as lines  and short interspersed nuclear elements  . although hundreds of thousands of copies of individual tes have been identified  <cit> , only a small number of composite elements are reported for the human genome including sva that contains sine, vntr , and alu elements  <cit> . additional examples are the composite dna transposon ricksha, as well as harlequin and herv <dig> that have mostly simple repeats inserted into the relevant herv elements.

segmental duplications , another type of repeating dna which differs from the traditional tes described above, make up ~5% of the human genome  <cit> . sds are low copy number repeats, with a size of at least  <dig> kb and ≥ 90% sequence identity among the copies. although under extensive investigation in recent years, the origins and the duplication mechanisms of sds remain largely unclear  <cit> . no possible linkages between sds and retrotransposons had been reported until our recent discovery of two composite ltr-retrotransposon-like elements in the human genome  <cit> .

while characterizing a genome-wide sd in the human genome, we discovered two new composite ltr retrotransposon-like elements, which we named da and xiao, meaning big and small in chinese respectively. complete da/xiao copies were found to have an architecture resembling bacterial composite dna transposon tn <dig>  consisting of a middle region  flanked by two elements that are direct repeats of each other. the only exception to this is that the flanking element is a modified herv-e rather than a dna transposon  <cit> . however, barring this structural resemblance, there is no experimental evidence that could determine whether da and xiao are indeed composite ltr-retrotransposons. consequently, it is currently unclear whether they have propagated in the genome via retrotransposition or by other mechanisms.

xiao, with a core of  <dig> kb, was found to originate from a region of chromosome 19p encoding olfactory receptor 7e members  <cit> . da, with a core of ~ <dig> kb, appears to have evolved from a xiao that had an extra ltr5b element, which likely evolved from an ancestral xiao via insertion of a herv-k that later degenerated to a solo ltr  <cit> . the evolvement of da, according to our analyses  <cit> , was accomplished by insertion of ~ <dig> kb of chimeric sequence derived from chromosomes 16p and 21q into the xiao core, followed by insertion of  <dig> kb of tes and retrogenes. da or xiao elements were identified at  <dig> loci on  <dig> chromosomes, harboring a total of  <dig> copies of da and  <dig> copies of xiao  <cit> . based on our reconstructed human-mouse-rat ancestral genome  <cit>  and the rhesus macaque genome  <cit> , only das mediated intra-chromosomal rearrangements.

our previous bioinformatics analyses  <cit> , with the published human, chimp and rhesus macaque genomic sequences  <cit>  as well as the recently released orangutan and marmoset genomic contig sequences, indicated that da and xiao emerged in the genome after the human/apes diverged from old world monkeys ~ <dig> million years  ago  <cit> . in addition, structural analyses indicated three types of da existing in the genome: type i da is the most ancestral form ; type ii has an herv-e inserted into an existing herv-h, while type iii has a sequence duplication of ~ <dig> kb derived from chromosome 8p and is the most recently evolved   <cit> . to further refine this analysis, we conducted experiments to investigate the xiao/da orthologues in primates whose genomes have not yet been sequenced. this study greatly expanded the primate list under examination by including great apes, lesser apes, old world monkeys, new world monkeys, and a prosimian , covering an evolutionary span of  <dig> myr. the analyses led to a more accurate age determination of da and xiao, indicating that their amplification activity coincided with that of group i herv-e elements. it also illustrated an evolutionary path with stepwise structural changes for the elements. the study has shed more light on theses two intriguing and complex elements that have reshaped our genome.

RESULTS
age determination of xiao as well as type i, type ii and type iii das by examining their internal junctions
duplicon type-specific internal primers
as described previously  <cit> , four types of duplicons exist in the human genome: xiao, as well as type i, ii and iii das. based on their architecture, we designed primers that are specific to each type of duplicon for polymerase chain reaction  analyses. as shown in fig. 2a, "standalone xiaos"  do not have an ltr5b element . this is unlike the "insertion-ready xiao" which, based on our previous analyses  <cit> , is likely to have evolved from a "standalone xiao" by acquiring a herv-k insertion , due to the fact that the donor sequence has neither ltr5b nor herv-k at the corresponding position. we therefore used the pre-insertion site of ltr5b  to design primers that can only amplify the standalone xiaos but cannot amplify those xiao regions inside das. type i das appear to have evolved from a ltr5b-containing xiao via insertion of three sequence fragments derived from chromosomes 16p and 21q into the xiao core  <cit>  . consequently, we designed four pairs of primers flanking both insertion junctions, as well as the two 16p and 21q chimeric sequence fusion junctions , to amplify type i das in primate genomes. compared to type i das, type ii das have an extra herv-h/herv-e/herv-h element . thus, primers were designed flanking the right herv-e/herv-h junction, which we found to only exist inside das via comparison of the junction sequence with the entire human genome. finally, given that type iii das have an additional  <dig> kb sequence duplication derived from chromosome 8p, primers were designed to span the 16p/8p chimeric sequence fusion junction . we also ensured that each primer was not copy-specific and that its sequence was common  to nearly all copies of a duplicon type.

age of xiao and three types of da
with the primers described above, we performed pcr experiments with the primate species indicated in fig.  <dig>  with each experiment repeated multiple times. as shown in fig. 2b, xiao and type i da were amplified with the genomic dna of apes but not with that of old world monkeys, new world monkeys, or the lemur . however, type ii and type iii das could be amplified only with the human, chimp, bonobo and gorilla genomic dna but not with that of other primates. these results indicate that xiao and type i da first emerged in the genome between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago , whereas type ii and type iii das emerged between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago . this study further refines the previous bioinformatics analyses that compared the released human, chimp, orangutan, rhesus macaque, and marmoset genomic sequences and concluded that xiao and type i da emerged within the recent  <dig> myr  and type ii/iii da emerged within the recent  <dig> myr .

the 16p-21q junction primers amplified multiple bands with the human, chimp, bonobo, and gorilla  genomic dna but only a single band with that of the gibbon and the siamang . this implies that polymorphism of this junction is present in the human, chimp, bonobo, and gorilla genomes but absent in the gibbon and siamang genomes. partial confirmation of this fact was obtained through in-silico pcr analyses  with the published human and chimp genomic sequences, showing amplification of multiple pcr products of approximately  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb in size . the only other ape whose genome has been sequenced is the orangutan. unfortunately, however, the current orangutan release is a draft assembly from 6× whole genome shotgun sequences and contains gaps, which prevent accurate in-silico pcr results from being attained.

by examining the sequences of the in-silico pcr products, we found that the polymorphism is caused by either a  <dig> bp truncation of the chromosome 16p donor sequence at the fusion junction, or an aluy insertion . we also performed in-silico pcr analyses with other primers  and found that, overall, the in-silico results agreed with the experimental analyses , yielding a single-sized product for xiao and type ii and iii das but multiple-sized products for type i das for the human and chimp genomes .

age determination of xiao as well as type i, type ii and type iii das by examining insertion junctions of individual da/xiao locus
to determine when each of the  <dig> da/xiao loci identified in the human genome emerged during the course of evolution, we tried to amplify either the two insertion junctions or the pre-insertion junction for a given locus from the genomic dna of the  <dig> primate species  as illustrated in fig. 3a. we were able to design primers flanking the insertion sites for  <dig> of the  <dig> total loci . the remaining  <dig> loci were found to be located in repeat-rich regions  and, as a consequence, we could not find primer pairs whose sequences were sufficiently unique .

for loci that are not associated with large inversions , we performed three sets of pcr experiments to amplify the two insertion junctions and the pre-insertion junction as shown in fig.  <dig>  in contrast, for loci that are associated with large inversions , only the insertion junctions were examined. this is because it is not a straightforward task to pair the primers for amplification of the pre-insertion junction because at least two distinct loci were involved. also, it is important to note that the inversion might have caused sequence deletions/duplications/insertions, thus complicating the pre-insertion site amplification analysis.

each pcr experiment was repeated at least three times in order to confirm the results. in total, at least  <dig>  pcr experiments were performed. as summarized in table  <dig>  the majority of the pcr experiments were conclusive. this required that the results from at least two separate pcr experiments agree with each other for a given pcr reaction, and the results from at least two junctions  agree with each other for a given locus . this analysis supports conclusions obtained with internal primers as described above. in addition, the results indicate that the xiao amplification peak was between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago , whereas the da amplification peak was between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago  .

 <dig> loci not examined  included xiaos at 2q-95mb, 3q-113mb, 11p-17mb, 13q- <dig> mb and 13q-63mb, as well as the 11p-3mb da. bioinformatics analyses found all these loci in the chimp genome but not in the rhesus and marmoset genomes. except for 11p-3mb da as well as 13q- <dig> mb and  <dig> mb xiaos, the rest of the loci were found in the current orangutan genome release  <cit> .

 <dig> others include rhesus/pigtail/tamerin/spider monkeys and lemur. in a few cases, non-specific bands  were amplified with the old world monkeys, new world monkeys, and the lemur.

 <dig> "?" indicates that the pcr results were inconclusive , and further analyses are needed to confirm the existence or absence of the locus.

 <dig> this locus was found to be associated with a da in the published chimp genome.

 <dig> internal fissions occurred in these das and subsequent inversions dispatched broken pieces of da to several distinct loci  <cit> . all loci involved were examined by the pcr experiments.

 <dig> we did not find a herv-h/herv-e/herv-h element inside the 4p- <dig> mb and - <dig> mb das in the published human genome, but a previous study  <cit>  found this element at both loci.

 <dig> several das were found in the 8p 7– <dig> mb and 11– <dig> mb regions.

 <dig> we found a large internal deletion for this da in the chimp genome .

tsd identification
using the strategy indicated in fig.  <dig>  we sequenced the pcr product of the pre-insertion junction amplified from either the pigtail macaque or the rhesus macaque. we then compared the resulting sequences to sequences flanking each of the two relevant insertion junctions in the human genome, which were determined by aligning the duplicon under study with all other duplicons. for all three xiao loci that were sequenced, we successfully identified the tsds . this was consistent with our previous bioinformatics analyses which found tsds for a majority of xiao and unrearranged da loci  <cit> . these analyses suggest that da and xiao may, perhaps, be tes and that they could have spread throughout the genome via transposition.

structural polymorphisms of da elements between the human and the chimp
at least  <dig> of the  <dig> total da/xiao loci identified in the human genome were also found in the chimp genome. proof of this is given by the insertion junction amplification experiments described above  and the previous bioinformatics analyses  <cit> . this means that da and xiao have been largely quiet in the human lineage during the last  <dig> myr, after the human diverged from the chimp. however, we did find a few large structural variations present between these two apes by comparing the corresponding genomic sequences. for instance, we found that the human 11q-67mb da  was degenerated to ~ <dig> kb in the chimp genome, with  <dig> kb internal sequences deleted . on the other hand, the xiao/da locus at  <dig> mb of chromosome  <dig> was found to be  <dig> kb in the chimp genome, but have degenerated to  <dig> kb in the human genome due to a  <dig> kb internal deletion of the da copy . additionally, we could not find the chimp homologues of the human da/xiao copies at 11– <dig> mb of 8p in the current release of the chimp genome, but we did successfully amplify its external junctions with the chimp dna sample in our pcr analyses   <cit> . at this point, we do not know if this is due to large internal deletions of da/xiao in the chimp lineage, or to the incompleteness of the current chimp genome release.

discussion
using the knowledge gained by our previous bioinformatics analyses  <cit>  regarding the architecture and genomic locations of the recently discovered composite ltr-retrotransposon-like elements da and xiao, we designed experiments to investigate the homologues of the human da/xiao elements in primates whose genome has not yet been sequenced. the da/xiao pattern results, shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  seemed to divide the apes into three groups. the first group; including the human, the chimp, the bonobo, and the gorilla; possesses a majority of the xiao loci as well as da loci of all three types in their genome. the lesser apes, including the gibbon and the siamang, belong to another group whose genome harbors only a fraction of the xiao loci and type i da loci. the orangutan appears to be between the two groups, having most of the xiao loci but only type i das. the results indicate that da and xiao elements had been most active in great apes but seem to have been quiet in the human lineage during the past  <dig> myr . analysis of the released chimp genome, which did not yield chimp-specific da/xiao loci either, supports these results by indicating that da and xiao have been most likely quiet in the chimp lineage as well during the past  <dig> myr after the human-chimp divergence.

as this analysis only focused on the homologues of the human da/xiao loci, we do not know if da and xiao have also been quiet in other primate lineages or if they are still active today. to answer this question, it would be helpful to contrast closely related-primates such as the chimp and the bonobo on these elements. regardless of whether or not these elements are still active today, it will always be informative to search for nonhuman primate-specific da and xiao loci, as well as to search for other types of da and xiao  in primates besides the chimp and the human. we did analyze the current orangutan genome release, and did not find orangutan-specific da/xiao copies except for one possible xiao locus. however, this does not necessarily signify that no orangutan-specific da/xiao elements are present, because the current release of the orangutan genome is in draft state and some sequences could be missing . we will continue this study with newer releases once they become available. analyzing the gibbon and siamang genomes may provide interesting information, because da and xiao emerged immediately before these lesser apes diverged from the great apes. as an increased da/xiao activity was observed in the great ape lineages , it would be useful to find out if amplification of da/xiao also peaked in these lesser apes. this would likely yield gibbon/siamang-specific da/xiao loci and/or da/xiao structures . we hope that these future studies will shed more light on the nature, evolution, and function of these two intriguing elements.

despite their structural resemblance to composite dna transposon tn <dig> , we have no evidence demonstrating that da and xiao are indeed composite ltr-retrotransposons. however, considering the possibility of da/xiao being tes raised by identification of tsds at a majority of un-rearranged xiao/da loci , it may not be completely out of the question to hypothesize that da and xiao are composite ltr-retrotransposons. if so, we could also speculate that they have relied upon the retrotransposition machinery from active herv-e elements to move around in the genome in a way that is analogous to a defective virus carrying an oncogene that depends on a helper virus to propagate.

a previous study  <cit>  divided the > <dig> copies of herv-e in the human genome into two groups, and reported that group i amplification peaked between  <dig> and 6– <dig> myr ago . this amplification peak overlapped with those of da and xiao . in addition, similar to the da and xiao elements as well, no human-specific or chimp-specific copies of herv-e were found  <cit> , indicating that herv-e had stopped its activity before the human-chimp divergence. these observations are consistent with the hypothesis described above, stating that da and xiao had depended upon the herv-e machinery to proliferate in the genome. however, the enormous size of da and xiao  certainly raises questions regarding this hypothesis, as retroviruses including hervs are below  <dig> kb and the longest known rna viruses  are only ~ <dig> kb. even if the hypothesis is proven to indeed be true, some novel mechanisms which are different from that of hervs must have been used. this is especially so considering that tsds identified at the da/xiao loci ranged from 4– <dig> bp with most being  <dig> bp  <cit> , unlike those of hervs which are usually  <dig> bp. of course, only future studies can clarify these issues.

CONCLUSIONS
to better understand the evolution of the recently discovered composite ltr-retrotransposon-like elements da and xiao, we investigated their orthologues in non-human primates whose genomes have not yet been sequenced. these included great apes, lesser apes, old world monkeys, new world monkeys, and a prosimian. by examining various internal junctions of da and xiao in these primate genomes, we found that xiao and type i da first emerged between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago , whereas type ii and type iii das emerged between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago . after investigation of the orthologous sites of the  <dig> da/xiao loci in the human genome, we found that the xiao amplification peak was between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago, whereas the da amplification peak was between  <dig> and  <dig> myr ago. neither da nor xiao seemed to be active in the human and chimp genomes during last  <dig> myr. thus, the activity of da and xiao coincided with that of group i herv-es during the course of evolution.

the current study led to a more accurate determination of the age of the elements than our previous bioinformatics analyses comparing the released human, chimp, rhesus macaque, orangutan, and marmoset genomic sequences. this information illustrated an evolutionary path with stepwise structural changes for da and xiao during the past  <dig> myr, and has shed more light on these two intriguing elements.
