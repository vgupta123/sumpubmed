BACKGROUND
viral vectors, especially lentiviral vectors, are useful in transducing genes of interest in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. lentiviral vectors are promising tools for gene therapy because they can transduce postmitotic cells, allow long-lasting expression, and exhibit low toxicity and low oncogenic activity  <cit> . high-titer lentiviral vectors are required for efficient transduction and time- and cost-savings. lentiviral vectors are usually produced in 293t cells with the transfection of self-inactivating expression and helper plasmids  <cit> . because most lentiviral vectors contain ubiquitously active promoters, the proteins of interest are inevitably expressed in the viral-vector-producing cells, possibly affecting their vector-producing ability.

potassium  channels play pivotal roles in the regulation of cellular excitability and in ion transport in excitable and nonexcitable cells. abnormalities of the k+ channels result in epilepsy, arrhythmia, and disturbances of the immune system  <cit> . for instance, the loss-of-function mutation of strongly inwardly rectifying k+ channel  <dig>  , which is expressed in the heart, blood vessels, kidney, and brain, results in type i andersen–tawil syndrome  <cit> , and the kir <dig>  knockout phenotype is lethal in mice, indicating the physiological importance of the channel  <cit> . therefore, lentiviral vectors expressing k+ channels, including kir <dig> , may offer possible treatments for some diseases. studies have shown that the adenoviral expression of kir <dig>  effectively prevents hyperalgesia by suppressing the neuronal activity of dorsal root ganglion cells  <cit> . kir <dig>  has also been used to modulate the excitability of neural and cardiac cells in experimental animals  <cit> .

however, the overexpression of the renal outer medullary k+  channel resulted in neuronal degeneration  <cit> . in viral-vector-producing cells, their vector-producing capacity might be reduced by the expression of k+ channels. in this study, we report that the production of a lentiviral vector expressing kir <dig>  was increased by blocking the cellular kir <dig>  current during its production. blocking the channel also increased the viral titer when the neuron-specific synapsin i promoter was used. this method was partly applicable to lentiviral vectors expressing other k+ channels, depending on the currents in the resting state. this increase in viral titer correlated with the cellular membrane potential, whose major determinant is the k+ current, suggesting that the effectiveness of the blockade can be predicted from the membrane potential of k+-channel-expressing cells.

RESULTS
blocking the kir <dig>  current increases virus production
in our previous study, we prepared lentiviral vectors that bicistronically coexpress kir <dig>   or the dominant-negative form of kir <dig>   and green fluorescent protein   <cit>  . in these vectors, we used the chicken β-actin promoter because among all the promoters tested by okabe et al.  <cit> , it showed the most persistent and highest expression in hippocampal neurons. because the β-actin promoter is ubiquitously active, the kir <dig>  channels were inevitably expressed in 293t cells during viral production. to test whether their expression affects the viral-vector-producing capacity of the cells, we prepared these two viral vectors and compared their titers before  and after  centrifugal concentration. the titers of lv-kir <dig>  were significantly lower than those of lv-kir-dn in both the unconcentrated  and concentrated samples , suggesting that the kir <dig>  current had a negative effect on viral vector production.figure  <dig> schematic illustration of lentiviral vectors. structures of the lentiviral self-inactivating expression plasmids lv-kir <dig> , lv-kir-dn, lv-gfp, lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> , lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig> , lv-Δcmv-ltr-rre-cppt-synapsinp-kir <dig> , lv-kv <dig> , lv-trek, and lv-herg. the upstream cmv promoter was used to transcribe the viral genomic rna. cmv, cytomegalovirus promoter; ltr, long terminal repeat; ψ, rna packaging signal; rre, rev-responsive element; cppt, central polypurine tract; β-actin, promoter of chick β-actin gene; synapsin, human synapsin i promoter; gfp, green fluorescent protein gene; nls, nuclear localization signal; wpre, posttranscriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus; ∇, deletion in the u <dig> region of the 3′-ltr.



to confirm this negative effect, we added a selective kir <dig>  channel blocker, ba2+ , to the culture medium of the lv-kir <dig> -producing cells immediately after transfection. we then determined the titers of lv-kir <dig>  prepared in the presence or absence of ba2+ with the transduction to 293t cells. as expected, the addition of ba2+ significantly increased the lentiviral titers in both the unconcentrated  and concentrated samples . because we prepared the control and ba2+-treated samples concurrently using the same batches of 293t cells and plasmids, the efficacy of plasmid transfection should have been identical in both. to confirm that ba2+ increased the lentiviral titer by blocking the kir <dig>  channels, we prepared a lentiviral vector that only expressed gfp  in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm ba2+. the addition of ba2+ had no effect on the titer of the unconcentrated sample , suggesting that ba2+ acts on the kir <dig>  channel. interestingly, the titers of lv-gfp were higher than those of lv-kir <dig>  .figure  <dig> channel blockers increase titers of lv-kv <dig>  and lv-trek, but not those of lv-gfp and lv-herg.  ba2+ had no effect on the titer of lv-gfp. after 293t cells were transfected with lv-gfp and helper plasmids, they were incubated in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm bacl <dig> for 48 h. the titers in the unconcentrated aliquots were determined by measuring the number of gfp-positive cell clusters after the transduction to 293t cells .  increase in lv-kv <dig>  titer. the addition of 4-ap  significantly increased the titer of lv-kv <dig> . because the lentiviral vectors prepared in the presence or absence of blocker were prepared concurrently, the data were analyzed with a paired t test .  increase in lv-trek titer. similarly, the transfected 293t cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm bacl <dig>  and the titers were measured .  no increase in lv-herg titer. in contrast, the addition of e- <dig> did not increase the titer of lv-herg .



to exclude the possibility that ba2+ affects the infectious ability of the lv-kir <dig>  particle, we prepared lv-kir <dig>  without the addition of ba2+ and concentrated it. the infectious ability of the vector was then determined with transduction to 293t cells in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm bacl <dig>  the addition of bacl <dig> had no effect . next, to exclude the possibility that ba2+ affects the stability of the lentiviral particle, lv-kir <dig>  was incubated in medium with or without  <dig>  mm bacl <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 24 h at 37°c in a 96-well plate. we then measured the infectious ability of the particle by adding 293t cells to each well and counting the numbers of gfp-positive cell clusters after 48 h. the half-life of the transduction ability of the particles was estimated as the decline in the infectious units. the addition of ba2+ had no effect on the half-lives .

correlation between lv-kir <dig>  titer and kir <dig>  current
to confirm the negative correlation between the k+ current and lentiviral production, we examined the ba2+ concentration–response relationship for the lv-kir <dig>  titer and for kir <dig>  conductance, and compared them. to estimate the ba2+ concentration dependence on the titer, we prepared lv-kir <dig>  in medium containing varying concentrations of ba2+  and estimated the half-maximal effective concentration . we also measured the kir <dig>  conductance with varying concentrations of ba2+ with the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration  and estimated the half-maximal inhibitory concentration  of ba2+. the ec <dig> of the titer  was similar to the ic <dig> of the conductance . we then analyzed the correlation between the lv-kir <dig>  titer and kir <dig>  conductance at various concentrations of ba2+  and found a negative correlation .figure  <dig> correlation between lv-kir <dig>  titer and kir <dig>  current.  ba2+ concentration–lv-kir <dig>  titer relationship .  ba2+ concentration–kir <dig>  conductance relationship . these relationships were fitted to the hill equation .  correlation between kir <dig>  conductance and lentiviral titers at various concentrations of bacl <dig>  values were normalized to that of  <dig>  mm bacl <dig> and were fitted by linear regression .  changes in the membrane potential at higher extracellular k+ concentrations. tyrode’s solution, in which the k+ concentration was varied, was perfused sequentially.  extracellular-k+-concentration-dependent increase in the titer of lv-kir <dig> . lentiviral vectors were prepared with medium containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 29 mm kcl. we determined the lentiviral titers and found significant differences at different extracellular k+-concentrations .  correlation between membrane potential and the lv-kir <dig>  titer at various extracellular k+ concentrations. values are the means of four experiments and were fitted with linear regression .



to further verify that the k+ current decreased the lentiviral titer, we tested the effect of higher extracellular k+ concentrations, which reduced the k+ gradient. first, we examined the effect of the higher k+ concentrations on the whole-cell membrane potential of a kir <dig> -expressing cell with the whole-cell current-clamp method. the resting membrane potential was depolarized according to the extracellular k+ concentration . lv-kir <dig>  was then prepared in medium containing higher concentrations of k+. as expected, the titers of lv-kir <dig>  increased as the extracellular k+ concentration increased . the changes in the lentiviral titer correlated well with the membrane potential , supporting the negative effect on the production of lv-kir <dig> .

higher transduction to neurons in hippocampal slices
to test whether target neurons were more effectively transfected with ba2+-treated higher-titer lv-kir <dig>  than by the control vector, we examined the transduction ability to the hippocampal neurons. we injected concentrated lv-kir <dig>  vector, prepared in the presence or absence of ba2+, into the ca <dig> pyramidal layer of a hippocampal organotypic culture. the hippocampal slices were incubated for 7 days, and then fixed and counterstained with an antibody directed against neun, a marker protein of neurons . the number of gfp-positive cells was significantly higher in the ba2+-treated preparation than in the control .figure  <dig> higher transduction to the hippocampal neurons.  concentrated lv-kir <dig>  vector, prepared in the absence or presence of ba2+, was injected under the same conditions  into the extracellular space of the ca <dig> pyramidal layer in organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus. seven days after injection, the cultured slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with anti-neun antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated with alexa fluor  <dig>  the single-plane images were taken with a confocal microscope . bar, 50 μm.  differences in the numbers of gfp-positive cells. numbers of gfp-positive cells seen within the visual field described above were counted .



applicability to the vector of neuron-specific synapsin i promoter
we then tested whether this method is applicable to a vector that expresses kir <dig>  under the control of the synapsin i promoter, which is considered to act selectively in neuronal cells  <cit> . we constructed the plasmid lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> , in which the β-actin promoter was replaced with the human synapsin i promoter . we prepared the lentiviral vector in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm bacl <dig>  the titer of the synapsin-promoter-containing vector was determined with the transduction to pc <dig> cells because the synapsin i promoter activity is higher in pc <dig> cells than in 293t cells. interestingly, the addition of bacl <dig> increased the titer of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  in both the unconcentrated  and concentrated samples . however, the degree of increase  was smaller than that observed for lv-kir <dig>  . the titers of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  were lower than those of lv-kir <dig> , whose titers were determined in 293t cells, because titration using pc <dig> cells underestimated the titers. for instance, titration with pc <dig> cells underestimated the titers up to  <dig> -fold, even for lv-kir <dig>  .figure  <dig> blocking kir <dig>  current increased the titer of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> .  the titer of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  was increased by blocking the kir <dig>  current. the viral vector was prepared in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm bacl <dig>  the titers of unconcentrated  and concentrated  viral vectors were measured in host pc <dig> cells. the addition of ba2+ significantly increased the titers .



the increase in the titer of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  caused by ba2+ suggests that the kir <dig>  channels were moderately expressed in 293t cells. if this is the case, gfp should have also been expressed in the 293t cells because the lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  plasmid has a bicistronic expression element, the internal ribosomal entry site . we examined the gfp expression in 293t cells transfected with plasmid lv-kir <dig>  or lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> . as expected, the lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> -transfected cells expressed gfp 24 h after transfection , although the expression of gfp was lower than that in the lv-kir <dig> -transfected cells .figure  <dig> gfp expression from plasmids containing synapsin promoter.  expression of gfp with synapsin promoter plasmids. 293t cells were transfected with no plasmid , lv-kir <dig>  , lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  , lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  , or lv-Δcmv-ltr-rre-cppt-synapsinp-kir <dig>  . images were taken after 24 h under a microscope . bar, 50 μm.  summary of gfp expression analyzed with the imagej software. the whole-cell area of each cell was manually selected, and the average gray value  is presented as the fluorescence in arbitrary units  of the software . note the moderate gfp expression in the lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> -transfected cells  and its slight expression in the lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig> -  and lv-Δcmv-ltr-rre-cppt-synapsinp-kir <dig> -transfected cells . the gfp expression in the two Δcmv-plasmids-transfected cells was lower than that in the lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> -transfected cells . schematic illustrations show the difference in plasmid construction.



this finding raises the question: which promoter mediated the expression? there are two possibilities: synapsin promoter might be activated or the transcript derived from the upstream cmv promoter might be translated into kir <dig>  and gfp. to test these two possibilities, we constructed the plasmid lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig> , in which the upstream cmv promoter was deleted from lv-synapsinp-kir <dig> , and used it to transfect 293t cells. we observed slight expression of gfp in the cells 24 h after the transfection of the plasmid , which was clearly higher than that in the mock-transfected cells . this result suggests that the synapsin promoter was moderately activated in the 293t cells. furthermore, the expression of gfp from lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  was lower than that from lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  , suggesting that the transcript from the cmv promoter was also translated to some extent.

to eliminate the possibility of a promoter activity in the fragment containing the long terminal repeat , central polypurine tract , and between them, we deleted that fragment . the gfp expression from lv-Δcmv-ltr-rre-cppt-synapsinp-kir <dig>  was similar to that from lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  , indicating the lack of promoter activity in the ltr-rre-cppt fragment. the results are summarized in figure 7f.

partial applicability to other k+ channels
the k+ channel family consists of more than  <dig> subtypes and is the largest family of ion channels. we tested whether the blockade method evaluated here increased the titers of lentiviral vectors expressing other k+ channels. we constructed lentiviral vector plasmids that expressed the shaker-type k+ channel , twik-related k+ channel , and human ether-a-go-go related gene  channel . we prepared these lentiviral vectors in the presence or absence of a blocker of each channel and measured the lentiviral titers in unconcentrated aliquots. these viral titers, in samples prepared without a blocker, varied as follows: lv-kir <dig>  < < lv-kv <dig>  < lv-herg < lv-trek < lv-gfp . interestingly, the channel blockade increased the titers of lv-trek and lv-kv <dig> , but not that of lv-herg . the degree of increase caused by the addition of the blockers also varied among the channels , in the order: lv-kir <dig>  > > lv-trek ≥ lvkv <dig>  > lv-gfp ≥ lv-herg, which was almost opposite the order described above.figure  <dig> correlation between the resting membrane potential and lentiviral titer.  resting membrane potentials of k+-channel-expressing cells. 293t cells were transfected with plasmid lv-gfp, lv-herg, lv-kv <dig> , lv-trek, or lv-kir <dig> . the membrane potentials of these k+-channel-expressing cells were measured in the whole-cell current-clamp mode 24 h after transfection .  correlations between membrane potential and the titers of the lentiviral vectors. the titers of the unconcentrated lentiviral vectors encoding gfp, herg, kv <dig> , trek, and kir <dig> , prepared without blockers, tended to correlate with the membrane potentials of the 293t cells expressing these channels. linear regression was used to correlate the data .  correlation between membrane potential and the increase in the lentiviral vector titer. the membrane potentials of 293t cells expressing gfp, herg, kv <dig> , trek, or kir <dig>  correlated well with the percentage change in the lentiviral titer after the addition of the blockers .  reduction in atp level and its restoration by ba2+. the atp levels in 293t cells were measured 48 h after transfection, without harvesting the lentiviral vectors. the atp levels were normalized to that of the mock-transfected cells .



the lentiviral vector expressing kv <dig> , through which a transient outward k+ current  flows, was prepared in the absence or presence of a low concentration  of the ia channel blocker, 4-aminoprydine , because higher concentrations of 4-ap affected cell growth . as shown in figure 3b, the addition of 4-ap significantly increased the titer of the lentiviral vector to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the control value.

because the trek-1c channel is partially blocked by ba2+  <cit> , we added 1 mm bacl <dig> to the medium of lv-trek-producing cells. this addition increased the titer of lv-trek to 162 ±  <dig> % of the control value . we also used bupivacaine, which is a more potent blocker of trek- <dig>  <cit> , but unexpectedly, it decreased the lentiviral titer. this decrease was attributed to the toxicity of bupivacaine  <cit>  and confirmed by the morphological changes in the cells . we measured the extent of the blockade with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and found that 1 mm bacl <dig> blocked  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the bupivacaine -sensitive current expressed in 293t cells . we also tested the effect of a herg-specific blocker, e- <dig> , on the lv-herg titer, but its addition decreased the titer insignificantly .

correlation between lentiviral titer and membrane potential of cells expressing other k+ channels
to understand the variations in the lentiviral titers and their increase by channel blockers, we measured the membrane potentials of 293t cells expressing kir <dig> , gfp, kv <dig> , trek- <dig>  or herg. the voltage dependencies of these k+ channels differ. for instance, the kir <dig>  channel conducts current at resting and hyperpolarized potentials and is blocked during stronger depolarization. in contrast, the herg channel only opens during depolarization. therefore, the amplitude of the k+ current in the resting state should differ among these viral-vector-producing cells, and might cause variations in the lentiviral vectors’ titers and the degree of their increase by channel blockers. we measured the membrane potentials, which are largely determined by the k+ currents, of 293t cells transfected with these lv plasmids 24 h after transfection. the membrane potentials were significantly hyperpolarized in the kv <dig> -, trek-1-, and kir <dig> -expressing cells, in that order . however, the membrane potential of the herg-expressing cells was similar to that of the gfp-expressing control cells.

we then assessed the correlation between the membrane potentials of the expressing cells and the viral vector titers. the resting membrane potential tended to correlate with the titers of the lentiviral vectors prepared without blockers . we next assessed the relationship between these membrane potentials and the degree of increase in the lentiviral titer induced by the channel blockers . the degree of increase correlated negatively with the membrane potential, i.e., the more hyperpolarized the membrane, the larger the increase in the lentiviral titer, except that the rank order of kv <dig>  and trek- <dig> was reversed. therefore, the difference in the amplitude of the k+ current seemed to affect the viral titers and the effectiveness of the blockade.

reduced atp in lv-kir <dig> -producing cells
the cellular adenosine triphosphate  level is reportedly critical for virus production  <cit> . the overexpression of the kir <dig>  channel might accelerate atp consumption by na+/k+-atpase during the intake of k+, which is effluxed through the k+ channel, reducing the cellular atp. to clarify the mechanism underlying the changes in the production of lv-kir <dig> , we measured the cellular atp levels 48 h after the cells were transfected with the plasmids. the atp level in the lv-kir <dig> -producing cells was significantly lower  than that in the mock -transfected cells . the addition of  <dig>  mm ba2+ restored the atp concentration to  <dig> % of that in the mock-transfected cells. ba2+ did not affect the total cell number, which was estimated with microscopic counting and the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase  activity in living cells lysed with detergent .

discussion
in this study, several lines of evidence showed that the titers of lentiviruses expressing k+ channels were increased when the k+ current was blocked during preparation. this evidence is as follows.  the titer of lv-kir-dn was higher than the titer of lv-kir <dig> .  the addition of ba2+ increased the titer of lv-kir <dig> .  a higher extracellular k+ concentration increased the titer of lv-kir <dig> , which correlated with the membrane potential of the kir <dig> -expressing cells.  channel blockers increased the titers of lv-kv <dig>  and lv-trek, but not that of lv-herg. the degree of the lentiviral increase caused by the channel blockers correlated well with the cellular membrane potential.  the titers of the lentiviral vectors expressing these k+ channels, prepared without blockers, tended to correlate with the membrane potential of the cells expressing each channel. because the k+ current is the major determinant of membrane potential, these results consistently suggest that the viral-vector-producing ability is reduced by an excessive k+ current. therefore, it seems that larger k+ currents in the resting state caused lower lentiviral titers without blockers. in addition, the larger currents also resulted in higher degree of the increase in titers with blockers. membrane potential may be useful in predicting the effectiveness of channel blockers on the lentiviral titer. we anticipate that this method will also be effective for romk and epithelial na+ channels, which conduct currents in the resting state. the titers and membrane potentials of kv <dig>  and trek differed in their ranking, which is probably attributable to the incomplete blockade of the trek channel by bacl <dig> 

atp is reportedly a critical factor in the production of vaccinia virus  <cit>  and adenovirus  <cit> . burgenner et al.  <cit>  reported a sigmoidal relationship between cellular atp levels and reovirus production and suggested that there is an “atp threshold” for virus production. our data also suggest that reduced atp plays a causal role in the phenomenon described here. this is the most likely explanation because na+/k+-atpase consumes 55% of the energy in renal cells to maintain the appropriate ion balance  <cit> .

even when the synapsin i promoter was used, the addition of ba2+ increased the viral vector titer, whereas the degree was lower than that of β-actin promoter. this increase is attributed to both the moderate activation of the promoter and the translation of the transcript from the upstream cmv promoter in 293t cells. the activation of the synapsin i promoter was evident from the slight expression of gfp in the cells transfected with plasmid lv-Δcmv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  or lv-Δcmv-ltr-rre-cppt-synapsinp-kir <dig> , in which the upstream cmv promoter and flanking elements were deleted. the deletion of the cmv promoter also resulted in reduced gfp expression, suggesting that the transcript from the upstream cmv promoter was translated. for these reasons, the titer of lv-synapsinp-kir <dig>  was increased by the addition of ba2+. this would be the case even if a tissue-specific or inducible promoter were used for the expression of the gene of interest.

extensive efforts have been made to efficiently produce lentiviral vectors, including the development of packaging cell lines  <cit>  and the addition of sodium butyrate  <cit> , fructose  <cit> , a kinase inhibitor  <cit> , and caffeine  <cit> . this study provides another option for increasing the lentiviral titer with a simple method. such improvements in lentiviral preparation will facilitate basic neuroscience research and the development of clinical gene therapies for channelopathies in the future. indeed, hippocampal neurons are transduced more effectively with high-titer viral vectors prepared with k+ channel blockers.

CONCLUSIONS
blocking the kir <dig>  current increased the titer of lv-kir <dig>  without affecting the infectious ability or stability of the viral particles. hippocampal neurons are more effectively transfected with high-titer viruses than low-titer viruses. channel blockers also increased the titers of lentiviral vectors expressing some other k+ channels, and the extent of these increases correlated with the cell membrane potential. therefore, it may be possible to predict the effectiveness of channel blockers on lentiviral titers by measuring the membrane potential of the transfected cells. we anticipate that this method will be applicable to other ion channels and will facilitate basic and clinical neuroscience research.
