BACKGROUND
as the dialog between a host and bacterium requires the coordinated activity of many bacterial gene products in response to the host  <cit> , investigating the bacterial pathogenesis in a diverse set of pathogen-host interactions can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of bacterial virulence. there have been extensive studies on bacteria pathogenic to higher order hosts  <cit> , particularly the zebrafish and mouse which have emerged as model animals for the study of bacterial pathogenesis  <cit> . these studies have provided ample information on the virulence genes essential for pathogenesis, yet we know little about the origin and evolution of these genes. characterizing the bacterial genes expressed in hosts representing different evolutionary history may enable us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of bacterial virulence  <cit> . for example, the pathogenic interaction between the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and bacterium salmonella enterica has showed a remarkable overlap between salmonella virulence factors required for human and nematode pathogenesis  <cit> . while there are several reports of bacterial illness in snakes, tortoises, and reptiles  <cit> , little is known about bacteria-involved infections in a slug host  <cit> .

as lower order invertebrates, mollusks are proven to be excellent model systems for studies in neurophysiology, behavioral ecology and population genetics  <cit> . the slug deroceras reticulatum is one of the important mollusk invertebrates. moraxella osloensis is a gram-negative, oxidase positive, aerobic bacterium within the family moraxellaceae in the gamma subdivision of the purple bacteria. this bacterium has recently been identified as one of the natural symbionts of a bacteria-feeding nematode, phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita , which is a lethal endoparasite of slugs  <cit> , including the slug d. reticulatum  <cit> . in nature, bacteria colonize the gut of nematode infective juveniles  which represent a specialized stage of development adapted for survival in the unfavorable environment. the ijs seek out and enter the slug's shell cavity through the posterior mantle region. once inside the shell cavity, the bacteria are released, and the ijs resume growth, feeding on the multiplying bacteria  <cit> . the infected slugs die in 4– <dig> days, and the nematodes colonize the entire cadaver and produce next generation ijs which leave the cadaver to seek a new host  <cit> .

the lethality of these nematodes to slugs has been shown to correlate with the number of m. osloensis cells carried by ijs  <cit> . tan and grewal  <cit>  demonstrated that the  <dig> h old m. osloensis cultures inoculated into the shell cavity were highly pathogenic to the slug. they further reported that m. osloensis produced an endotoxin which was identified to be a rough type lipopolysaccharide  with a molecular weight of  <dig> kd, and the purified m. osloensis lps was toxic to the slug with an estimated 50% lethal dose of  <dig> μg when injected into the shell cavity  <cit> . although these studies laid the foundation for the bacteria-slug interaction, the virulence mechanisms of m. osloensis that result in pathogenesis and slug mortality are not established. the present study was designed to determine the molecular and genetic basis of m. osloensis virulence to the slug d. reticulatum.

several techniques have been developed to study bacterial genes that are expressed during infection or that are required for virulence in the host during infection. the most commonly used techniques include in vivo expression technology   <cit> , signature-tagged mutagenesis   <cit>  and differential fluorescence induction   <cit> . recently, the selective capture of transcribed sequences  technique has been developed to study bacterial gene expression specifically in macrophage  <cit> . this technique has been used to identify bacterial virulence factors, and has been demonstrated to be capable of identifying genes expressed in specific tissues of infected animals  <cit> . more recently, microarray analysis has also been applied in monitoring bacterial gene expression during host infection  <cit> . as the host and bacterial cdnas can be easily differentiated using scots, and this technique does not require prior genetic information of the pathogen, we applied scots to determine m. osloensis gene expression in the slug host d. reticulatum at two time points following infection. because important changes in gene expression can occur in bacteria during transition from active growth to stationary phase  <cit> , we also investigated differential gene expression of  <dig> h m. osloensis in the in vitro cultures  relative to  <dig> h cultures  to confirm the infection specificity of the in vivo expressed genes. mutational analyses  were also carried out to examine the roles of selected genes.

RESULTS
differentially in vivo expressed genes
to identify m. osloensis transcripts specifically expressed in d. reticulatum, we injected slugs with  <dig> ×  <dig> bacterial cells. we evaluated colonization by analyzing m. osloensis cell counts, and found that bacterial counts varied from  <dig> to  <dig> colony-forming units  per d. reticulatum  <dig> h or  <dig> h post-inoculation, indicating colonization and persistence of the injected bacteria in the slug. transcripts expressed by m. osloensis in the slug at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post inoculation were identified by subjecting the in vivo cdnas to three iterations of scots in the presence of the transcripts expressed by  <dig> h late log-phase m. osloensis in vitro cultured in the brain heart infusion   medium. the enriched cdnas were cloned into a ta vector. each individual clone was further screened by dot blot hybridization . the individual clones with signals stronger than or present on the blot hybridized to the in vivo cdnas compared to that with signals on the blot hybridized to in vitro cdnas were chosen for nucleotide sequencing and analysis. a total of  <dig> clones  were sequenced. these screened cdnas represented the differentially expressed genes within the slug but in lower abundance or absent in the  <dig> h in vitro cultures. a fraction of the identified sequences was further confirmed to be m. osloensis specific by pcr amplification of m. osloensis genomic dna with the designed primers based on identified sequences, and the results confirmed that m. osloensis transcripts were successfully isolated from the infected slugs using the scots technique. the identified sequences were analyzed using the non redundant algorithms of blast  <cit>  in the website of ncbi   <cit> . for each identified sequence, about two to five cdna clones were detected in the screened library, and these clones showed the same hits in the genbank. in this study, the identity of up-regulated sequences at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post infection was identical. we identified  <dig> distinct sequences  representing  <dig> up-regulated genes  which carry putative functions in cell structure integrity, energy metabolism, degradation, and translocation. three of these sequences, m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  have similarity with genes encoding hypothetical proteins, and further analysis by inverse pcr amplification and sequencing demonstrated that they were similar to the genes encoding preprotein translocase , acyl-coa synthetases , and acetyl-coa carboxylase . one of the sequences  did not exhibit similarity to any genes or gene products in current databases, and is possibly novel. m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> genes contain translated sequences of "gly-asp-pro-asp" repeats, and are similar to membrane proteins. sequence m <dig> shows similarity with the gene encoding protein-disulfide isomerase  in other bacteria. sequences m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> have similarity to genes that encode iron regulation related proteins in other bacteria; thus, the identification of these genes suggests that iron availability in slug host may be limited. the sequence m <dig> shares similarity to the gene encoding acetyltransferase  that functions in the energy metabolism and is often involved in antigen synthesis  <cit> . the sequence m <dig> has similarity with the predicted gene β-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase  which encodes enzymes participating in the conversion of protocatechuate to succinate and acetylcoenzyme a   <cit> .

differentially in vitro expressed genes at the stationary phase
in order to determine if the identified in vivo expressed genes are infection-specific, the differential expression of transcripts corresponding to  <dig> h m. osloensis cultures  relative to  <dig> h cultures  was examined by scots technique. nine sequences  were identified to be differentially expressed in  <dig> h relative to  <dig> h cultures . one sequence  did not show any similarity in current ncbi databases, and is thus possibly novel for m. osloensis. sequences mo <dig> and mo <dig> have similarity to transposases and integrase, mo <dig> is similar to topoisomerase, mo <dig> has high similarity to actin-like atpase, and mo <dig> is similar to atpase involved in dna replication. two sequences, mo <dig> and mo <dig> are similar to genes of ubis and acs that were also found to be differentially expressed under in vivo condition, suggesting that these two genes are not infection specific.

mutational analysis of identified genes
to investigate the role of up-regulated genes in m. osloensis in the slug, three mutants of selected genes were constructed using inverse pcr combined with insertional inactivation. the selected genes represent three distinct groups: cell surface protein  which has been previously reported as a virulence gene in pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , protein-disulfide isomerase  which has been recently identified as a virulence gene in pathogenic bacteria associated with higher order hosts  <cit> , and ubiquinone synthetase  which has been reported to be important for bacterial survival and was found to be up-regulated in vitro at the stationary phase  <cit> . as described in materials and methods, the inverse pcr was performed using primers with the engineered ape i and bma i sites. the 800-bp non-polar kanamycin resistance gene was inserted into the 50-bp internal deletion within the open reading frame  of spp, dsbc, or ubis. compared to the whole sequences of dsbc and ubis amplified in this study, the insertions were located  <dig> bp downstream from the atg codon of dsbc, and  <dig> bp downstream from the gtg start codon for ubis. after natural transformation and double recombination, the resulting isogenic mutants were obtained in vitro after  <dig> h incubation, and they were termed as m-spp, m-dsbc, and m-ubis, respectively. the virulence of wild type and mutants was determined by direct inoculation into the slug d. reticulatum and subsequent survival analysis. all three mutants demonstrated the level of virulence similar to the wild-type strain in the first two days  . however, at  <dig> days post infection, all three mutants produced significantly lower slug mortality relative to the wild-type parent strain .

we further complemented the constructed mutants. the full length and promoter region of dsbc and ubis were obtained by inverse pcr strategy with the aid of six pairs of primers  and six restriction enzymes .

amplification of the spp orf was not successful due to the presence of repetitive sequences, and thus was not used for further analysis. the orf of dsbc and ubis were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, and the blast searches confirmed that they were similar to protein-disulfide isomerase and ubiquinone synthesis genes, respectively. the sequence analysis revealed that dsbc gene had an n-terminal signal peptide, and contained thioredoxin-like domain with the characteristic cys-x-x-cys active site. the complemented mutants, termed as c-dsbc and c-ubis, were obtained by transferring intact dsbc and ubis genes borne in the plasmid into the respective m. osloensis mutant by electroporation. the level of virulence of complemented mutants in the slug was similar to wild-type strains .

growth rates of mutants
as reduced virulence of mutants may result from growth defect, the growth rates of dsbc and ubis mutants in the bhi medium were examined. compared to the wild-type m. osloensis, the dsbc mutant did not show any growth defect in vitro . however, the ubis mutant showed significant reduction in growth rate in vitro. the ubis mutant grew slower than the wild type and its viability  was about 12% lower relative to the wild-type strain after  <dig> h , and the growth defect became evident at the time of the late log phase entering into the stationary phase. in addition, the growth defect phenotype was fully complemented by the trans-complementation with the gene itself.

discussion
the current study is the first description of virulence genes expressed by a bacterium in a slug host. the scots analysis demonstrates that m. osloensis expressed  <dig> genes in the slug host when compared with log-phase bacteria growing in vitro in the bhi medium. comparison with differentially expressed genes by the  <dig> h relative to  <dig> h in vitro cultures revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes appeared infection specific. among these infection-specific genes, some genes likely play roles in energy metabolism, and may affect virulence indirectly by sustaining the basic cell functions during infection. for example, the pca gene identified here plays a role both in nutrition and detoxification in other bacteria  <cit> . gene abp identified in this study is similar to the genes encoding atp binding proteins that confer multiple resistance and ph adaptation. blast search reveals that abp also shares high similarity to the polysaccharide export protein gene. in case of pathogenic bacteria, polysaccharide is often secreted as an evolutionary adaptation to adhere to host surfaces and to escape from drying and host immune defense  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that abp gene product may play an important role in m. osloensis survival in the slug.

ubis gene exhibits sequence similarity to the gene encoding protein that functions in ubiquinone synthesis. ubiquinone is a central component of the electron transport chain under aerobic conditions and functions in the formation of disulfide bonds in periplasmic proteins by facilitating the reoxidation of protein-disulfide isomerase  <cit> . as ubis gene was also up-regulated in the stationary phase in m. osloensis, this gene may be important for bacterial survival during starvation and could be induced by the stress conditions. further examination of ubis mutant growth in vitro indicated that the reduced virulence of this mutant may be due to the reduced growth rate.

preproteins are exported primarily across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasm or the outer membrane by the sec system composed of the translocase secyeg  and seca  proteins  <cit> . seca interacts dynamically with the secyeg components to drive the transmembrane movement of newly synthesized preproteins  <cit> . tomkiewicz et al.  <cit>  showed that in escherichia coli seca drives a constant rate of preprotein translocation consistent with a stepping mechanism of translocation. further, the seca expression is subject to the translational control in response to the cellular activity of protein translocation  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of seca gene in vivo in m. osloensis suggests that the expression of seca is regulated by the infection process.

three of the identified genes, sclb, vspc, and spp, are similar to the genes encoding structural proteins of the outer membrane. outer membrane proteins are known to be critical for establishment of disease in the host by causing resistance to immune killing  <cit>  as demonstrated in a fish pathogenic bacterium, edwardsiella tarda  <cit> . virulence of spp mutant to the slug is significantly reduced indicating that surface membrane proteins are also important for m. osloensis infection in the slug.

genes ats, adh, acs and acc found to be up-regulated in vivo in m. osloensis are similar to the genes reported to be important for the virulence in other bacterial pathogens. ats gene is similar to the gene for acetyltransferase which has been known as an effector protein in bacterium yersinia  <cit> , and plays an important role in regulating biological signaling. ald gene is similar to the gene for aldehyde dehydrogenase . in vibrio cholerae, aldh gene has been found to be located in a pathogenicity island in epidemic and pandemic strains but absent from non-pathogenic strains  <cit> . gene acs shares sequence similarity with the gene of long chain fatty acid coa synthetase , an enzyme involved in lipid synthesis and whose expression may be important at various stages of infection  <cit> . fadd gene expression has been demonstrated to be important in virulence in a number of organisms, including xanthomonas campestris  <cit>  and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . in this study, acs gene was identified to be up-regulated both in vivo and in vitro stationary phase. thus, the expression of acs protein may be related to m. osloensis survival and virulence under in vivo conditions.

the gene dsbc belongs to the gene family dsb involved in disulfide bond exchange which catalyses the folding of various factors including virulence determinants such as the components of type iii secretory machinery and assembly of type ii secreted subunits into effector proteins in a number of bacteria  <cit> . various gram-negative bacterial pathogens use type ii or iii secretion system as a basic virulence mechanism  <cit> . dsb protein has been identified as a virulence factor in diverse bacterial pathogens associated with different higher order hosts. in pathogenic shigella flexneri, dsb gene is necessary for intracellular survival and cell-to-cell spread in the host  <cit> . in the fish pathogenic bacterium, flavobacterium psychrophilum, mutants of dsb-like protein gene exhibited reduced virulence and cytotoxicity  <cit> . dsb gene was also identified as a virulence factor by scots technique in the pig pathogenic bacterium actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  <cit> . mutation of dsbc in bordetella pertussis resulted in decreased toxin secretion  <cit> . in our study, the dsbc mutant showed significantly reduced virulence to the slug, but its normal growth rate in vitro confirms that dsbc serves as a virulence gene in m. osloensis in the slug host.

previous studies by tan and grewal  <cit>  showed that lipopolysaccharide  of m. osloensis alone was sufficient to cause slug mortality. compared to the virulence defects of dsbc and ubis mutant, it may be hypothesized that there is relationship between lps and dsbc or ubis despite the current lack of experimental evidence. the link between ubis and dsb has been reported in a study in escherichia coli which demonstrated that disulfide bond formation in exported proteins is catalyzed by dsb protein, and is directly coupled to the electron transport chain via reoxidation of dsb protein by either ubiquinone or menaquinone  <cit> . in addition, most animals possess agglutinating activity to recognize self or non-self particles, and the agglutinins are believed to be lectins in invertebrates. according to barker  <cit> , the land slug incilaria contains three lectins which show significant sequence similarity to other animals, having two disulphide bonds which may be related to lectin activity. since dsb gene family in prokaryotes has the ability to rearrange non-native disulfides to their native configuration  <cit> , it is proposed that dsbc functioning as a virulence factor in m. osloensis may be related to the host self/non-self recognition.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, no differences in m. osloensis gene expression between  <dig> h and  <dig> h post inoculation were observed indicating that the infection was established in  <dig> h. thirteen m. osloensis genes were up-regulated in the slug. most of these genes have been previously identified in other bacterial pathogens, suggesting the conserved nature of bacterial virulence genes. among the  <dig> up-regulated genes, acs and ubis were also expressed in the bacterial stationary phase in vitro, and ubis was further confirmed to be important for m. osloensis survival in the slug. the remaining  <dig> genes were infection specific. one of these genes, dsbc, belonging to dsb gene family, was confirmed to be a virulence gene in m. osloensis based on the mutagenesis study, growth rate and virulence bioassays. to our knowledge this is the first report on bacterial gene expression in a slug host interface.
