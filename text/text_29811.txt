BACKGROUND
patterning phenomena based on the activation of target genes in a
concentration-dependent manner by diffusive signaling molecules, so called morphogens,
are of great biological importance  <cit>  as shown, e.g., in drosophila  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . model-based approaches are often used to investigate the formation of
morphogen gradients and to analyze the sufficiency of the known regulatory mechanisms.
such models do not consider the cells individually but rather as a continuum and
describe the macroscopic  dynamics of the process. the emerging
macroscopic models are theoretically justified and have already been employed in various
biological contexts . an interesting process of such type is the patterning of the neural plate,
a precursor tissue, which gives rise to the vertebrate central nervous system .

shortly after gastrulation, the neural plate undergoes patterning along the
anteroposterior axis into four distinct regions. these regions are the presumptive
forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. this subdivision relies on a
well-defined and locally restricted expression of genes mediating the action of short
and long-range signaling centers, so-called secondary organizers  <cit> . of special interest is the isthmic organizer , the secondary organizer
located at the boundary between the prospective mid- and hindbrain. the iso is necessary
and sufficient for the development of the mid-hindbrain region   <cit>  and it is characterized by the localized expression of several transcription
and diffusive signaling molecules.

in the context of the iso, eight genes are of special interest: orthodenticle
homologue  <dig>  and gastrulation brain homeobox 2
, two transcription factors initially expressed in the anterior and
posterior, respectively, part of the developing embryo abutting each other, and whose
expression boundary determines the position of the future mid-hindbrain boundary ;
fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , which is necessary for the
patterning of the mhr, and wingless-type mmtv integration site family member 1
, required for the maintenance of the iso, two
“morphogens” secreted from the posterior and anterior, respectively, border
of the mhb; and the engrailed  as well as the
paired box  transcription factors acting
down- or upstream of fgf <dig> and wnt <dig> and mediating their patterning/maintenance function
at the mhb  <cit> . en <dig> and en <dig> are subsumed under the identifier en,
and pax <dig> and pax <dig> are subsumed under the identifier pax due
to their conserved biological function in mid-/hindbrain boundary  development. all
of these genes start to be expressed around mouse embryonic day   <dig>  of development.
various loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that at e <dig> , these genes
are interdependent and their expression patterns are maintained at least until e <dig> .
these genes build the basis of a gene regulatory network  that is necessary for the
sharpening and subsequent maintenance of the specific iso gene expression pattern  <cit> . one crucial aspect of the iso function is the spatio-temporally defined and
localized expression of its constituent genes, including the formation of sharp
boundaries between the gene expression domains .

experimental data obtained from in situ hybridization experiments have been employed to
determine the expression domains/patterns of the iso genes . these
data are semi-quantitative and capture the level of transcription relative to the
minimal and maximal transcription in the same tissue. based on those experiments the grn
schematically depicted in figure 1a was inferred  <cit> . using artificial thresholds wittmann et al.  <cit>  constructed the boolean model shown in figure 1b.
this boolean model has been shown to be able to generate and robustly maintain the
experimentally observed steady state pattern  <cit> . however, the usage of artificial thresholds results in the loss of
information. to exploit all information contained in the data, wittmann et al.  <cit>  derived a continuous spatio-temporal model using a discrete to continuous
transformation of the boolean network. therefore, the discrete boolean update functions
are replaced by hill-type functions  <cit> . the resulting macroscopic model describes the time evolution of
transcription factor activities. as these activities are confined to individual cells
there is no spatial evolution on this level. hence the equations can be treated as
ordinary differential equations  for a each point in space. the tissue scale
morphogen gradients and their dynamics are described using diffusion equations. both
models are coupled to account for secretion and uptake of morphogens, the interface
between the models, and the full system is shown in figure 1c. using this semi-quantitative spatial modeling approach, several interesting
aspects of the mhb formation can be assessed, which cannot be studied using boolean
models  <cit> .

the class of macroscopic models for two-scale processes provides the basis of the
following theoretical and numerical analysis of iso gene network and signaling proteins.
complementing previous work we address the existence, uniqueness, positivity of
solutions for the model. we extend previous studies and analyzed the induction of the
gene expression patterns at the mhb, especially, we focused on the formation of sharp
spatial patterns. therefore, we introduced theoretical and numerical tools for
semi-quantitative two-scale processes. using these tools we found that the model has to
be extended by a regulation of wnt <dig> expression to describe the sharp expression
pattern observed in vivo. based on this insight we analyzed, which regulation
mechanisms allows for the specific wnt <dig> expression pattern, focusing on
post-transcriptional regulation by mirnas. mirnas are short  non-coding rnas which post-transcriptionally regulate the gene  expression  <cit> . this is achieved by binding of the mirna to the mrna, repressing the
translation of the mrna into protein. furthermore, if the degree of mirna-mrna
complementarity is high mirnas induce the decay of the mrna  <cit> . mirnas play a critical role in diseases such as cancer  <cit>  and neuro-degeneration  <cit>  as well as embryonic development  <cit> .

RESULTS
macroscopic, semi-quantitative model of a two-scale process
the macroscopic spatio-temporal model used to describe the patterning process during
the mhb formation considers two biological scales. the single cell scale, on which a
semi-quantitative model for the transcription factor activation is employed, and the
tissue scale, on which morphogen concentrations and gradients are regarded. the state
of the individual cells is described by the activities of the four transcription
factors, otx <dig>  gbx <dig>  en and pax and the two
morphogen encoding genes fgf <dig>  wnt <dig>  which are described in the
background section, and the morphogens fgf <dig> and wnt <dig>  the interactions are
schematically displayed in figure 1a. the joint dynamics
of transcription factor activities
u = ,…,u6)t
and morphogen
v = ,v2)t
are described by an eight-dimensional system of partial differential equations 
on the spatial domain
x ∈ u = .
as the up- and down-regulation of transcription depends only on the concentration of
transcription factors within the individual cells and the local concentration of
morphogens, the time evolution of the transcription factor activity is governed by a
reaction equation, 

 ∂∂tui=αuibi,v)−βuiui,i= <dig> …, <dig>  

with production term αuibi,v) and degradation rate βui. while αui and βui are constant,
bi,v) is potentially a
nonlinear function of x, u and
v. bi represents the
hill-type regulation of transcription factor i by transcription factors and
morphogens . the initial conditions for the
transcription factor activity are given by the spatial functions
u0i,
i =  <dig> …, <dig>  which describe quantitatively the expression
pattern at e <dig>  . hence,

states show a sharpening of the en and pax domain marked by

we assumed that the morphogens are produced proportionally to the activation of the
corresponding transcription factor ui which resembles a
constant translation of mrna to protein. the dynamics of the morphogen concentration
is then governed by a reaction-diffusion equation, 

 ∂∂tvj=αvjui−βvjvj+dj∂2∂x2vj,j= <dig> , 

in which αvj, βvj, and dj, denote the
constant synthesis, degradation, and diffusion rate, respectively. in the following,
we consider the anterior-posterior direction of the neural tube, which is large in
comparison to the mhr and the expected diffusion length scale. hence, no morphogen
arrives at the border, i.e. we have zero morphogen concentration,
vj = vj =  <dig> 
the initial conditions are given by a two-dimensional vector of spatial functions
vj <dig>  j =  <dig> ,
corresponding to the pattern at e <dig> . hence, 

 vj=v0j,j= <dig> . 

as the pdes for v are linearly coupled with the odes
for u, we can conclude that solutions exist for all
time points t ∈ [ <dig> ∞)  <cit> . furthermore, the solution is unique, positive and in
c) if the initial condition vector
t is positive and
bounded  <cit> . this means that we obtain a solution which is continuous with respect to
time and a square integrable function with respect to space and we can consider the
asymptotic steady state of the system. furthermore, the insight that the solutions
are square integrable in x ensures the convergence of finite-difference
methods, which are described in “methods”. in the simulation, special
attention has to be paid to the non-differentiabilities occuring at least for
otx <dig> and gbx <dig> in the stationary limit  <cit> .

mhb model predicts stable steady state patterns
biologically, one important characteristic of the grn at the iso is the activation of
the genes in a precise spatio-temporal manner and the correct positioning of their
expression domains  <cit> . once the pattern is reached it has to be maintained even if the whole
system is slightly perturbed for example by transcription noise. this implies that
the model has to exhibit a stable stationary limit solution, which resembles the
steady state gene expression pattern that is observed at e <dig> .

due to the nonlinear coupling, the analytical calculation of the steady state is
infeasible for most components of the system. only for otx <dig> and
gbx <dig> an analytical calculation of the steady state solution is possible
because they form a simple genetic toggle-switch system independent of the other
components. this system is well studied and we knew that it exhibits separated
expression domains depending on the interaction strength of the two players  <cit> . for simplicity and because we lacked detailed knowledge of the
interaction parameters of otx <dig> and gbx <dig>  we assumed a symmetric
parameter setup, i.e. 

 ∂∂tu1=α1knkn+u2n−β1u1∂∂tu2=α2knkn+u1n−β2u <dig>  

with α1 = α <dig> and
β1 = β <dig>  here
u <dig> denotes the expression of
otx <dig> and u <dig> denotes the
expression of gbx <dig>  based on the analytical calculation of the steady state
we found that the parameter values for which we obtained a steady state with
separated expression domains have to satisfy β1α1>1+1/n/n. furthermore, the point x∗
where both expression domains abut each other in the stationary limit is determined
by the initial conditions of otx <dig>  denoted by
u <dig>  and gbx <dig>  denoted by
u <dig>  if
u01>u <dig> for
x<x∗ and
u01<u <dig> for
x>x∗ then the boundary is placed at
x∗.

in the following, the mhb is placed in the middle of the considered interval,
x∗ =  <dig>  furthermore, similar to  <cit> , we set n =  <dig>  k =  <dig> , and
αi = βi = 1
for i =  <dig> …, <dig>  the diffusion coefficients of fgf8
and wnt <dig> were reduced compared to previous publications to
d1 = d2 =  <dig> .
for the chosen diffusion parameters the values v <dig> and v <dig> are approximately zero, ensuring that the dirichlet
boundary conditions have no significant influence on the dynamics or the steady state
of the systems, as assumed in the modeling process. for this setup we performed an
extensive simulation study to determine the non-trivial steady states of the system
. if the initial transcription factor and
morphogen patters are unimodal, we find two stable, non-zero stationary limit
solutions. while the steady state  <dig>  shows a maximal width for the expression domain of en and
pax, for steady state  <dig>  this width is minimal. the panels in figure 2b show
exemplary trajectories leading to the steady states. the simulation study indicates,
that these are the only steady states reachable from initially unimodal expression
domains.

for initially multimodal expression domains, we observed more complex expression
pattern, e.g., single spots of en or pax expression. these arise as
en or pax locally exceed the threshold of their mutual
activation, yielding isolated point regions with maximal en or pax
expression, respectively. the spots are positioned in the region between the minimal
and maximal width expression domain given by the steady states mentioned above. we
did not consider the steady states with expression spots as they are not thought to
be of biological relevance, however this shows that the model is capable of producing
a whole spectrum of steady states. subsequently, we analyzed the stability of the two
non-trivial steady states to understand the temporal dynamics in their close
proximity. we found that both non-trivial steady states are stable. for both steady
states that we consider, the expression of otx <dig>  gbx <dig> and
wnt <dig> are the same, whereas for fgf <dig>  en and
pax we observe a difference in the width of the individual expression
domains.

predicted steady states coincide qualitatively with the experimental
observations
we compared our steady state solutions and their dependence on initial conditions and
parameters to experimentally validated expression patterns. in our model the only
factor which determines the position of the mhb is the initial expression pattern of
otx <dig> and gbx <dig>  this major role of otx <dig> and
gbx <dig> has already been shown in in vivo knock-out or knock-in
experiments, in which a change of gbx <dig> and otx <dig> expression domains
also led to a change in the position of the mhb  <cit> . furthermore, both steady states show a restriction of the en and
pax expression to the mhb region, which can also be observed in
vivo <cit> . the steady state with the more restricted initial pattern
 shows a tighter expression domain. this tighter domain is due to the
activating interaction between en and pax, whereas the other steady
state is dominated by the activating interaction of fgf <dig> and wnt1
with en.

concerning the expression domain of fgf <dig> we found that in steady state  <dig> the
expression is restricted in posterior direction due to the regulation of
fgf <dig> by en and pax. only in this steady state a sharp
boundary of the fgf <dig> expression domain in posterior direction occurs
. this
agrees with the experimental observations that the expression of fgf <dig> is
restricted to a ring at the caudal border of the mhb  <cit> . furthermore, we concluded that the interactions which are not necessary
to maintain the expression pattern according to  <cit> , are required to sharpen the expression domain of the morphogen
fgf <dig>  those interactions are the activation of en by
fgf <dig> and wnt <dig> and the activation of fgf <dig> by en
and pax, which were not considered in  <cit> .

finally, we considered the expression pattern of wnt <dig>  which is the same in
both steady states. the iso is a signaling center and one of its main tasks is to
generate a well-defined wnt <dig> gradient. the gradient results from the sharply
restricted and positioned expression domain of wnt <dig>  however, unfavorable
smooth interfaces of expression domains occur if expression is only regulated by a
morphogen in our case fgf <dig> <cit> . depending on the diffusion coefficient of fgf <dig> and the
activation of wnt <dig> with fgf <dig>  the expression domain of
wnt <dig> becomes increasingly smooth. this disagreement with the experimental
results where wnt <dig> is expressed in a narrow ring at the rostral border of
the mhb with a clearly visible boundary  <cit> . for a detailed illustration and semi-quantitative assessment of the
expression domain of wnt <dig> we refer to the emap emouse atlas project  <cit>  .

in the following section we will discuss possible post-transcriptional sharpening
mechanisms for the wnt <dig> expression profile. as the more restricted
fgf <dig> expression pattern in steady state  <dig> is closer to the experimental
observations  <cit> , we will use this steady state in the following analysis, however, the
results are similar if steady state  <dig> is used. in particular the wnt1
expression patterns are alike for both steady states.

sharpening of the wnt <dig> expression by mirna interactions
as our simulations showed no sharply delimited expression domain in the anterior
direction for the wnt <dig> expression domain , there has to exist an unknown mechanism enforcing the sharpening of
the wnt <dig> profile over time, which is not considered in the model. in this
work we consider post-transcriptional mirna regulation as recent studies proved that
mirnas regulation is particular active at low mrna copy numbers, which occur in our
model simulation at the wnt <dig> expression domain boundary, and can induce gene
expression thresholds  <cit> . this might results in a spatial sharpening of the target expression
domain in the overlapping region  <cit>  via one of the following mechanisms: 

i) the mirna binds transiently to the mrna and only the mrna is degraded
.

ii) the mrna-mirna complex is degraded .

iii) the mrna-mirna complex is degraded and unbound mirnas are actively
transported between neighboring cells  <cit> .

the scenarios are illustrated in figure 3a. it is also
observed that mirnas do not lead to a degradation but to a translational inhibition,
which would results in a complex accumulation and a low degradation rate in scenario
ii) and iii). mathematically, the model extensions are given by

here, m is the relative concentration of mirna,

βm is the degradation rate,
dm is the diffusion coefficient of the mirna and
αm is the space dependent production
profile. following the suggestions in  <cit>  we used a sigmoidal shaped function
αm = p1/p2) + p4)
to model the spatial dependence of the mirna synthesis. the interaction strength of
mirna and wnt <dig> mrna is given by the binding rate κ, the
degradation rate of the resulting mrna-mirna complex is λ, and the
degree of mirna recycling is denote by ξ.

given this general model, the three scenario can be described by different parameter
sets. for scenario i), the turn-over parameters of the mirna are set to zero
αm≡ <dig> and
βm =  <dig>  assuming time-independent
overall mirna level. furthermore, mirna is assumed to be completely recycled,

for this extended macroscopic model the existence, positivity and uniqueness is also
guaranteed if and only if αm is a
bounded, lipschitz continuous function. this is the case as we assumed
αm to be a production profile with
values in  <cit> . hence, we could conclude that unique, positive solutions exist for
the extended model and we can simulate the model with the proposed algorithm. it is
not surprising that an overlap of the mirna and wnt <dig> profile leads to a
sharpening of the wnt <dig> expression profile. however, we are especially
interested in the spatial shape an mirna expression domain must have to sharpen the
wnt <dig> boundary sufficiently as this can easily be compared to experimental
findings and will lead to predictions for possible regulating mirnas. in this context
we defined a sharpening as reduction of wnt <dig> in anterior direction and no
reduction at the mhb, i.e. an increase in the second derivative with respect to
x of the wnt <dig> transcription level for
x ∈ .

we simulated the three scenarios for different parameter sets

using the same initial conditions and parameters for the original model components
and the profile function
αm =  <dig> / <dig> ) + 1)
with varying l . a representative simulation result is shown in figure 3c). in addition, we studied the influence of the mirna expression
domain on the sharpening effect in the different scenarios. therefore we varied the
overlap of the domains by increasing the profile function parameter l from 0
 to  <dig> . the results are shown in
figure 3d. we found that for scenario i) and ii) the
mirna level and the wnt <dig> expression domain have to overlap in the region
where wnt <dig> shows intermediate expression, i.e.
l ∈ . for both scenarios a complete overlap of
both domains leads to a overall reduction of wnt <dig> and we see no specific
sharpening, especially for scenario i) a complete overlap led to a wnt1
knock-down state for the set of considered parameters. for scenario iii) the domains
must only slightly overlap due to diffusion, if the domains strongly overlap the
mirna diffusing from the posterior direction leads to a blurring of the wnt1
domain at the mhb. we conclude that this scenario is not suitable for the mhb model
if we have a strongly overlapping mirna domain. in the following, we focus on
scenario i) for a low and ii) for a high degree of mrna-mirna complementarity  <cit> .

mir- <dig> regulates wnt <dig> mrna expression in vitro
up to this point, hypotheses about a possible regulation of wnt <dig> by mirnas
was based on available knowledge about mirna-mrna interaction  <cit>  and simulation studies of the mhb model. to gain additional insight, a
search for experimental evidence of mirnas possibly regulating the wnt <dig> mrna
expression was conducted. therefore, we performed a mirna target prediction and
experimentally validated the predicted mirnas by determining their expression pattern
in the developing mouse embryo  and their ability to
target the wnt <dig> mrna  in vitro.

we identified potential mirnas targeting the wnt <dig> mrna using a combination
of several target prediction tools . to reduce the number
of false-positive predictions, we post-processed the resulting list using logic
filtering. therefore, we defined a logical state  table for the three mouse
embryonic stages, namely e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> , including wnt <dig> and the other
five iso genes. e <dig>  is considered as the iso gene expression pattern, which has
refined to its sharp domains at e <dig> , is still maintained at e <dig> . assuming that a
functional mirna targeting wnt <dig> changes the amount of produced wnt <dig> protein
and hence the expression state of genes downstream of wnt <dig>  we concluded that those
genes change its expression state during mirna expression. the target prediction was
filtered for those mirnas that target at minimum two “off genes” and no
“on genes” for each defined developmental stage. this resulted in a list
of four mirnas possibly regulating wnt <dig> mrna expression . from these possible candidate mirnas
 were selected by ranking the interactions
according to the prediction scores provided by the distinct prediction tools.

to establish whether these two predicted mirnas are expressed at the mhb in a pattern
that is consistent with the model assumptions, their transcriptional profile in e <dig> 
and e <dig>  wild-type mouse embryos was determined. therefore, we used a very sensitive
radioactive in situ hybridization method  to detect the expression profile of these mirnas along the
entire anterior-posterior extent of the mhr on sagittal sections of these
embryos.

in the e <dig>  mouse embryo, mir- <dig> is expressed only very weakly across the
mhb and in the midbrain and rostralmost hindbrain, whereas mir- <dig> is
expressed strongly and uniformly across the mhb and in the midbrain and rostral
hindbrain . such a profile would lead to an overall
reduction of wnt <dig> mrna in the model proposed but has no sharpening effect.
in the e <dig>  mouse embryo, by contrast, mir- <dig> was expressed strongly and
uniformly in the entire mhr, including the midbrain, mhb and rostral hindbrain.
however, we noted a graded expression of mir- <dig> across the mhb in the
ventral mhr  at this stage. transcription of
mir- <dig> at e <dig>  was highest in the midbrain, declined towards the mhb
and was lowest in the rostral hindbrain, the region of the hindbrain that is under
the influence of the iso . this graded
mir- <dig> expression profile became even more evident when we calculated
the grayscale profile of mir- <dig> expression across the mhr, i.e. from the
anterior end of the midbrain to the posterior end of the rostral hindbrain, as shown
in figure 4b .

following  <cit>  we used the mirna profile function
αm = p1/p2) + p3)
and in order to analyze the sharpening effect of this profile we estimated the
parameters
p = 
and l . we obtained a best-fit profile according to the grayscale profile
. the profile is in accordance
with the modeling assumptions and we assumed that the expression pattern of the iso
genes is already stably established at e <dig>  and this particular mirna profile is not
established before e <dig> . this is evidence that the mirna regulation of wnt1
in the model is not a regulatory interaction necessary to establish the pattern, but
rather acts as a fine tuning mechanism to reduce the range of cells which have an
intermediate wnt <dig> expression. to verify this effect the model was simulated
using the e <dig>  expression pattern as initial condition and the estimated profile for
mirna production. we used scenario ii) for the simulation , because scenario i) mostly affects the repression of
wnt <dig> translation and we only have evidence for degradation with the
performed experiments. we also neglect iii) as we had no experimental evidence for a
diffusion of mir- <dig> in the neural tube. in the simulations, a clearly
visible sharpening effect could be observed, especially if we increase the
fgf <dig> diffusion coefficient .

in contrast to mir- <dig>  did not show a refined and graded expression around
the ventral mhb in the e <dig>  mouse embryo . these results indicated that only mir- <dig> is
expressed within the mhr and around the mhb in a pattern as predicted by the model
and consistent with a possible regulatory function of mir- <dig> on
wnt <dig> expression at the mhb.

to determine whether mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> can indeed regulate the
expression of wnt <dig> in a cellular context, we used the so-called luciferase
“sensor assays”. in this experimental setup, a fragment of the wnt1
3’utr containing the predicted mir- <dig> and mir-705
binding sites  was cloned at the 3’ end of a sequence encoding the firefly
luciferase protein. this constitutes the so-called “sensor vector”. the
luciferase protein transfected with the sensor vector are indirectly measured by a
bioluminescence reaction resulting in the emission of light, and the intensity of the
emitted light is directly proportional to the luciferase protein concentration in the
cells. co-transduction of the cells with the wnt <dig> 3’utr sensor vector
and mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> should result in a reduction of luciferase
protein levels, relative to an “empty” control vector , if and only if these mirnas bind to
their target sites within the wnt <dig> 3’utr and post-transcriptionally
inhibit the expression of luciferase protein in these cells. indeed, co-transduction
of hek-293t cells with the wnt <dig> 3’utr sensor vector and
mir- <dig> resulted in an approx. 23% reduction of luciferase
bioluminiscence in these cells , whereas co-transduction of hek-293t cells with the wnt1
3’utr sensor vector and mir- <dig> had no significant effect . this result indicated that
mir- <dig>  but not mir- <dig>  indeed targets the
wnt13’utr. next, we determined whether the post-transcriptional
regulation of wnt <dig> expression by mir- <dig> is indeed mediated by the
predicted mir- <dig> bs within the wnt <dig> 3’utr. therefore, the
predicted bs sequences were changed such that they could not be bound anymore by
mir- <dig>  and
consequently the expression levels of luciferase protein should not be affected
relative to the control  sensor vector. mutagenesis of the two
predicted mir- <dig> bs within the wnt <dig> 3’utr in fact abolished
the negative regulation of luciferase expression from the sensor vector by
mir- <dig>  this result indicated that the negative post-transcriptional
regulation of the wnt <dig> mrna by mir- <dig> is in fact mediated by the
two predicted mir- <dig> bs within the wnt <dig> 3’utr.

discussion
two-scale models allow for the simulation and analysis of complex patterning
processes including discontinuities
as many biological processes involve different spatial scales, multi-scale models
become increasingly important in computational biology. however, the methods
available to simulate and analyze these models rigorously, are still limited. in this
work, we considered the two-scale processes responsible for the formation of the gene
expression pattern constituting the iso. this process involves highly nonlinear
dynamics given by the gene regulatory networks in the single cells, as well as the
diffusion of morphogens on the tissue scale. while the dynamics of the tissue scale
are defined by a typical morphogen based patterning process, which has been
extensively studied  <cit> , the single cell system considered here is capable of generating
discontinuous expression profiles. due to numerical diffusion, common numerical
methods fail to converge for this class of models  <cit> . to circumvent this problem, we used an algorithmic scheme which exploits
the structure of the model, namely the two-scale nature. it merely uses finite
differences in the spatial coordinates, which have been successfully applied to
reaction-diffusion type models  <cit> , and stiff, adaptive solvers for the time integration. beyond standard
patterning systems, based on mass-action kinetics, the method applied can solve
systems with highly nonlinear interaction terms. as lipschitz continuity and
boundedness of the activation function is the only prerequisite for the existence and
the boundedness of solution, the results are widely applicable.

the two-scale modeling approach and the tailored simulation scheme are used to
analyze the dynamics of mhb formation and the corresponding steady state expression
pattern. this problem has been approached previously, however, direct numerical
integration using common pde solvers merely allowed for the study of the short-term
response  <cit> . to study the systems in the stationary limit, spectral methods were
employed  <cit> . for the model published by wittmann et al.  <cit> , the spectral method determined four steady states, two of which were
biologically plausible. however, the spectral methods provided only an approximation
of the steady state distributions, as they were based on a reduced model and the
discontinuities had to be predefined. this approach indirectly constrained the state
space of the model and the simulation-based stability analysis we carried out
revealed that one of these steady states was unstable, while the other one was stable
and corresponds to the steady state shown in figure 2b in
the left lower panel, with diffusion coefficients set to  <dig> . however, the steady
state depicted in figure 2b in the right lower panel was
not approximated by spectral methods, illustrating their limitations.

spatio-temporal model of mhb formation predicts post-transcriptional mirna
regulation
to determine the plausibility of the existing models, the computed steady state
profiles were compared to the experimentally observed expression profiles. while
simulation results and experimental observations agree qualitatively, the model fails
to describe the wnt <dig> profile adequately. the obtained expression domain had
a smooth gradient like form which contrasts the experimental findings where the
expression domain is a sharply delimited ring around the mhb  <cit> .

the sharpening of the wnt <dig> profile could be caused by different mechanisms,
ranging from additional transcriptional regulation to post-transcriptional
regulation. in this work, we focused on mirna-mediated regulation as mirna have
proven to be essential in embryonic patterning processes including morphogens, e.g.
in zebrafish  <cit> . furthermore, we already established the importance of mirnas in general
brain development . however, a role of mirnas in the formation of
the mhb and in the refinement of the wnt <dig> expression pattern at this
boundary has not been reported so far.

using our model, we could verify that different mirna-mediated regulation mechanisms
can cause a sharpening of the wnt <dig> expression domain at the mhb. this
sharpening can be induced by different mechanisms, for which we provided a
generalized mathematical model. in contrast to existing models for
post-transcriptional mirna regulation we thereby also considered the partial
recycling of the mirna and did not assume that the mrna-mirna complex is degraded
instantaneously, which is biologically often not plausible. given this theoretical
result, we performed a problem-tailored mirna target prediction. two candidate
mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were identified and analyzed
experimentally. the in situ hybridization  experiments showed a
promising qualitative expression profile for mir- <dig>  which is in line with
the predictions made by the model. however, it did not yield insight into the
detailed interactions or the necessity of mir- <dig> for mhb development, which
would require the establishment of a knock-out, knock-down and/or over-expression
mouse model for mir- <dig> 

beyond the complete verification of the mirna-based regulation of wnt1
expression in vivo, another question that arises about the mechanism behind
the formation of the observed gradient of mir- <dig> expression across the mhb.
possible mechanisms include the regulation of mir- <dig> expression by external
factors or by a direct feedback regulated by fgf <dig> or other factors involved
in the formation of the mhb. the latter could give rise to positive feedback and
further sharpening not yet considered in the model.

apart from a post-transcriptional regulation of wnt <dig> mrna expression by
mirnas, additional regulatory mechanisms might also influence the formation of sharp
wnt <dig> expression boundaries at the mhb. an example is the transcription
factor lmx1b, which is known to maintain wnt <dig> expression  <cit>  at the mhb at e <dig> . as this factor is expressed only in a ring around the
mhb, it might contribute to the sharpening of the domain. other signaling and
additional cell-cell communication processes can also not be ruled out. additional
studies are necessary to unravel or exclude further mechanisms involved in the fine
tuning of the iso gene expression profiles during mouse  embryonic
development.

CONCLUSIONS
to understand complex patterning processes quantitatively, spatial-temporal modeling has
been proven to be essential, for example in drosophila. in this contribution, we
illustrated how even a model using only a semi-quantitative description of the gene
regulatory network acting on a tissue scale can help to guide the discovery of novel
regulation mechanisms, in our case gene expression boundary sharpening induced by
post-transcriptional feedback mechanisms. as spatially resolved data increases quickly,
methods employing also spatial information will become more and more important.
