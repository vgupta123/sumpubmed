BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, currently afflicting about  <dig> million people worldwide, with increasing prevalence in an ageing society  <cit> . ad is characterized by large extracellular deposits of senile plaques in the brain, consisting of aggregated, fibrillar amyloid β-peptide   <cit> . extensive evidence supports a critical role of soluble intermediary aβ oligomers in the induction of synapse dysfunction and neurodegeneration  <cit> . aβ originates from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein   <cit> . app is cleaved by the membrane associated β- and γ-secretases that generate a number of differently sized peptides, of which aβ and aβ are most abundant. aβ is considerably more neurotoxic than aβ, in agreement with its increased hydrophobicity and tendency to aggregate. mutations within aβ are associated with familial ad and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. one example is the arctic  mutation, which entails enhanced aβ protofibril formation and fibrillation and causes typical ad neuropathology  <cit> .

despite the fact that much effort has been put into aβ-related research, many questions still need to be answered. most importantly, the precise mechanisms of aβ toxicity remain to be understood  <cit> . in this context, an inventory of oligomeric and protofibrillar aβ species would be desirable, detailing their biophysical properties and contributions to neurodegeneration. the extension and refinement of existing structural data on aβ oligomers and fibrils  <cit>  would help to derive structure-toxicity relationships and thus support ad drug discovery efforts. the accessibility of large amounts of aβ peptide is a prerequisite for these studies.

the majority of research using aβ peptides within the areas of biochemistry, biophysics and cell biology is conducted with synthetic peptides. an alternative to chemical synthesis is recombinant expression in escherichia coli, which is advantageous because of its low cost, the fast growth to high expression levels and the availability of established cloning and expression protocols  <cit> . recombinant expression is particularly attractive for structural biology projects, as it enables the production of milligram quantities of isotope or seleno-methionine labeled peptide for structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography at reasonable cost.

prokaryotic expression and purification of highly amyloidogenic peptides such as aβ has proven difficult due to their small size, their tendency to aggregate and the toxicity of the formed aggregates  <cit> . protein fusions, which might protect from proteolysis and enhance solubility, are typically used to tackle these problems  <cit> . the expression of aβ or aβ fused to segments of a surface protein from the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum  <cit> , maltose binding protein  <cit> , ubiquitin  <cit> , groes-ubiquitin  <cit> , trigger factor-ubiquitin  <cit> , and hen egg white lysozyme  <cit>  has been reported. in order to obtain aβ unaffected by the tag, its removal by site specific proteolysis is an inevitable additional purification step in all of these cases. the proteolytic cleavage reaction is cost-intensive, requires time-consuming optimization and necessitates post-reaction clean-up, which further reduces the attainable yield.

an alternative method to increase the yield of troublesome target proteins is coexpression with proteins that stabilize the target, assist with its folding, or prevent its aggregation  <cit> . this technique has permitted heterologous expression of macromolecular complexes, whose components could not be obtained individually  <cit> . co-overexpression of molecular chaperones can increase the yield of targets to varying extents  <cit> .

here we present a novel approach to the recombinant production of amyloidogenic aβ peptides. aβ is obtained by coexpression with an engineered binding protein that specifically binds and stabilizes the monomeric peptide. the binding protein, termed zaβ <dig>  belongs to the class of affibody affinity ligands  <cit> . affibody proteins have found applications in biotechnology, biochemical assays, disease diagnosis and therapy  <cit> . they are selected by phage display from libraries based on the  <dig> amino acid three-helix bundle scaffold of the z domain derived from staphylococcal protein a  <cit> . zaβ <dig> is a disulfide-linked homodimer of affibody subunits that binds monomeric aβ with nanomolar affinity  <cit>  . in contrast to the majority of aβ-antibodies  <cit> , zaβ <dig> targets the highly amyloidogenic central and c-terminal part of aβ . this region adopts a β-hairpin conformation upon binding and is buried within a hydrophobic tunnel-like cavity formed by zaβ <dig>  consequently, aβ oligomerization and fibrillation are inhibited by stoichiometric concentrations of zaβ <dig>  <cit> .

the concept of producing aβ by recombinant coexpression with zaβ <dig> offers several potential advantages:  binding of the coexpressed zaβ <dig> to the amyloidogenic sequence region of aβ could retain the peptide in a monomeric state during expression and the initial purification steps, thereby preventing any cell toxicity exerted by aggregates and facilitating purification.  aβ is largely unfolded in its unbound monomeric state  <cit> , and the complex might therefore protect the peptide from degradation.  both coexpression of auxiliary proteins and protein fusions impose additional metabolic burden on host cells, but the small size of the affibody scaffold limits this burden, which is especially important when short peptides such as aβ are to be expressed.

in the present implementation of the aβ:zaβ <dig> coexpression system, aβ is expressed tag-less, offering a particularly facile route to obtain pure peptide. as a consequence, a methionine resulting from the obligatory translation start codon is obtained n-terminal of aβ. the resulting peptide will thus be referred to as maβ below.

we report the expression and purification of 15n-labeled maβ, maβ and maβe22g by zaβ <dig> coexpression. the method yields pure, fibrillation-competent, monomeric peptides with conformational properties and aggregation propensities indistinguishable from those of the respective aβ peptides.

RESULTS
expression and purification of maβ peptides
a double cistronic coexpression vector based on the bacterial expression vector pacycduet- <dig>  was constructed. the coexpression vector contains the genes for maβ  and 6-tagged zaβ <dig> in the following order: t <dig> promoter- <dig> – maβ – t7promoter- <dig> – 6zaβ <dig> – t <dig> terminator. maβ is effectively overexpressed and obtained in the soluble fraction of cell lysates, indicating that its complex with the disulfide-linked zaβ <dig> dimer is formed and stable in the e. coli cytosol .

in the present system, the auxiliary protein zaβ <dig> is 6-tagged but not the target peptide, permitting the purification of tag-free maβ without a cleavage reaction. maβ is captured in complex with zaβ <dig> by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography  , demonstrating that the maβ:zaβ <dig> complex remains stable during the initial purification steps. resonances in the 15n heteronuclear single quantum correlation  nmr spectrum of the coexpressed maβ:zaβ <dig> complex coincide with those of the native aβ:zaβ <dig> complex, indicating that their structures are identical . maβ is not detected in the imac wash fraction . dissociation of the complex during imac is consequently not limiting the peptide yield.

separation of the maβ:zaβ <dig> complex is achieved by imac under denaturing conditions. pure monomeric maβ is subsequently obtained by application of the denatured peptide to size exclusion chromatography  using native running buffer, e.g.,  <dig> mm sodium phosphate,  <dig> mm sodium chloride, ph  <dig> .

sds-page shows a single band corresponding to the monomeric peptide in the case of purified maβ, whereas two additional bands at higher molecular weight, approximately at  <dig> and  <dig> kda, are observed for maβ . these bands have been observed before and have been attributed to the sds-induced formation of aβ oligomers  <cit> . mass spectrometry confirmed that the bands consist of maβ.

the peptide yield from a  <dig> l culture was  <dig> mg of maβ or  <dig> mg of maβ. purification of zaβ <dig> from an maβ coexpression culture gave  <dig> mg of the dimeric protein per  <dig> l of culture, indicating that ~60% of the expressed zaβ <dig> was in complex with maβ, whereas the rest remained unbound.

comparison of maβ with aβ
several different techniques were used to establish that maβ and aβ possess identical conformational properties and aggregation propensities. maβ and aβ are indistinguishable by sds-page . the extent of sds-induced oligomer formation of maβ is the same as for aβ and increases with temperature.

in sec, which separates molecules based on their hydrodynamic volume, very similar elution volumes are obtained for maβ and aβ . the elution volumes correspond to a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda on a scale calibrated with globular protein standards, in agreement with previous sec studies  <cit> . the high apparent molecular weight  is expected for a peptide that is disordered and consequently has a larger hydrodynamic volume than a globular protein of the same molecular weight.

the secondary structure content was analyzed by circular dichroism  spectroscopy . far-uv cd spectra of maβ conformed to those of aβ, featuring a minimum at ~ <dig> nm that is characteristic of the predominantly random coil conformation detected in non-aggregated aβ peptides  <cit> .

the 15n hsqc nmr spectra of maβ and maβ strongly resemble those of aβ and aβ, respectively . the large majority of aβ backbone amide resonances are recovered at identical positions in the maβ spectra. differences in chemical shifts are only observed for residues n-terminal of arg <dig>  such local shift changes are a mandatory consequence of the modification of the peptide sequence, in this case with the n-terminal methionine, and reflect local changes in the electronic environment. however, the chemical shift differences do not demonstrate any change in peptide conformation. the 15n hsqc spectra prove that met <dig> is unoxidized, by comparison with reference spectra for aβ and aβ  <cit> , in agreement with the mass spectrometry results.

the enhanced fluorescence emission of the dye thioflavin t upon binding to amyloid fibrils is frequently used to monitor fibrillation  <cit> . the fibrillation kinetics of aβ and maβ are identical within the error of the experiment . the presence of amyloid fibrils in the final steady-state of fibrillation was confirmed by electron microscopy .

production and characterization of maβe22g
the arctic mutant of aβ is a particularly interesting variant inasmuch as it links an increased tendency for protofibril formation and fibrillation to early onset familial ad  <cit> . to our knowledge, no protocol for the recombinant production of aβe22g has been reported to date, possibly due to the extreme aggregation propensity of this peptide variant. coexpression of zaβ <dig> permitted the production of maβe22g with a yield of  <dig> mg from a  <dig> l culture. sds-page demonstrates increased oligomerization of maβe22g compared to maβ . the major fraction of purified maβe22g is present in monomeric form as evidenced by sec, which gives an elution volume of ~ <dig> ml , similar to that of monomeric maβ and maβ . recombinant maβe22g can be employed, e.g., for nmr spectroscopy. the 15n hsqc nmr spectrum of maβe22g is displayed in figure 6c. as expected, the resonances of backbone amides in the vicinity of residue  <dig> are affected by the e22g mutation due to the removal of one negative charge. however, the changes are not large and the e22g mutant is also disordered in its monomeric state.

discussion
we have shown that coexpression of the zaβ <dig> affibody protein enables recombinant production of maβ peptides. zaβ <dig> binds to the amyloidogenic, hydrophobic central and c-terminal region of aβ and thus prevents peptide aggregation and potential detrimental effects on cellular homeostasis. maβ is released from zaβ <dig> only after an initial purification of the complex has been achieved, limiting the potential for adverse effects during peptide preparation.

coexpression is particularly profitable for the production of unstructured proteins that exhibit folding coupled to binding to the coexpressed partner  <cit> . the aβ:zaβ <dig> interaction is characterized by extensive coupled folding and binding of both binding partners  <cit> . in addition to increasing the thermodynamic stability of the complex's constituents, coupled folding-binding presumably also reduces their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation.

just as protein fusion tags preferably should be short, coexpression systems profit from a small size of the auxiliary protein, as this limits the metabolic burden. the affibody scaffold used for engineering zaβ <dig> is particularly small and a large fraction of the surface area is involved in the interaction with the target  <cit> . affibody ligands therefore represent promising auxiliary proteins for the development of coexpression systems, as exemplified in this study.

in contrast to previously published methods for recombinant expression of aβ  <cit> , the present system does not require a cleavage reaction. the reported cleavage reactions are time-consuming and/or expose the peptide to elevated temperature , which is detrimental to the production of aggregation-prone peptides  <cit> . all of these methods moreover include a reverse phase chromatography step, which necessitates thorough subsequent disaggregation of aβ peptides  <cit> . the coexpression system avoids acidic ph and organic solvents, and non-aggregated maβ in buffered aqueous solution is obtained directly from size exclusion chromatography. some of the expression methods previously reported have further specific disadvantages compared to the present system: the cleavage reaction causes microheterogeneities  <cit> , met <dig> is oxidized  <cit> , the peptide yield is lower  <cit> , or the peptide contains additional residues at the n-terminus  <cit> . in the case of the maltose binding protein fusion, a far greater peptide yield has been achieved  <cit> . this can in part be explained by the use of a fermentation system, which allows higher cell densities to be reached, frequently resulting in >10-fold the amount of purified protein in comparison to shake flask cultures  <cit> . the maltose binding protein fusion has only been used for production of the less aggregation-prone variant aβ and provides peptide that aggregates into predominantly non-fibrillar structures  <cit> .

the maβ peptides contain a methionine n-terminal of the aβ sequence, originating from the translation start codon. however, according to the biochemical and biophysical analysis of the peptides by sds-page, sec, nmr and cd spectroscopy, and to their aggregation propensity and aggregate morphology, the maβ peptides faithfully recapitulate the properties of aβ. the present coexpression system could be adapted to provide the peptide free of the additional n-terminal methionine by expressing a suitably tagged aβ peptide that can be cleaved to yield the native n-terminus. this would however delimit the ease and cost-effectiveness of the method. alternatively, secretion signal sequences could be added to both aβ and affibody. these would be expected to be proteolyzed upon secretion and aβ would thereby obtain its native n-terminus.

the 15n hsqc nmr spectra of maβ and aβ presented here superimpose on those reported previously in studies that thoroughly characterized aβ as largely monomeric under the applied experimental conditions  <cit> . this is in agreement with the observation that purified maβ and aβ adopt a predominantly random coil conformation . we conclude that maβ is purified in non-aggregated, monomeric form and applicable as starting material for the investigation of fibril  and oligomer formation. the potential to obtain labeled peptide makes maβ suitable for structural studies by, e.g., nmr spectroscopy. the coexpression system is compatible with the overexpression of the highly aggregation prone arctic mutant of maβ and can therefore be utilized to analyze the structural consequences of this and presumably other disease-related mutations of full-length aβ. previous systematic nmr studies on clinically relevant amino acid substitutions have pointed to a connection between monomer folding and oligomerization propensity, but were limited to decapeptide segments of aβ  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a recombinant expression system that provides facile access to both major isoforms of the highly amyloidogenic aβ peptide by coexpression of an engineered aggregation-inhibiting binding protein. the method also allows for the production of the particularly oligomerization and fibrillation-prone arctic  mutant of aβ. the peptides are obtained in non-aggregated, monomeric form and can be favorably applied for the investigation of aβ oligomerization and fibrillation, inclusive of structural biology studies.
