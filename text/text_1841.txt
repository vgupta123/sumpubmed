BACKGROUND
gene silencing is a powerful tool with which to study protein function. gene inactivations in mice have revolutionised the way we study both basic biology and a plethora of disease types  <cit> . gene silencing in human cells has, until recently, proven difficult to achieve  <cit> . research with plants, flies and worms recently uncovered a mechanism by which eukaryotic cells target mrnas, and perhaps even genetic loci, for specific gene silencing. this process is termed rna interference . rnai can also be induced in mammalian cells using double-stranded rnas , and has become the method of choice for targeted knock-down of gene expression in mammalian cells  <cit> . the apparent specificity of rnai also enables allele-specific gene targeting  <cit> . initial studies using rnai in mammalian cells centred around transient knock-down of target gene expression, either using direct transfection of synthetic short interfering rna   <cit> , transfection of in vitro transcribed sirna  <cit>  or transient expression of short dsrna via transfection of plasmid dna bearing rna polymerase iii promoter-driven expression cassettes  <cit> . short dsrnas of  <dig> to  <dig> base-paired nucleotides, complementary to the target mrna, were expressed as  <dig> complementary rnas or as a hairpin structure , and resulted in knock-down of the target message. while these initial rnai methods gave a rapid phenotypic read-out in vitro, stable knock-down of gene expression is required for monitoring long-term effects on cell function, for example, in developing tumors in vivo or in cell-based gene therapy approaches. efficient delivery of rnai-inducing dsrna or expression cassettes is required for effective transient and long-term studies. transfer of functional shrnas using lentiviral vectors appears to be a valid approach for effective, stable construct delivery to both cell lines  <cit>  and primary cells  <cit> . more recently, using several different expression systems and target cells, reports have highlighted the utility and specificity of the rnai approach  <cit> .

maintaining rnai-inducing dsrna below  <dig> nucleotides in length was thought to avoid activation of the interferon-induced anti-viral response. pkr is a key anti-viral regulator and its expression can be induced by the interferon response  <cit> . pkr is activated when bound to dsrna longer than  <dig> nucleotides, despite interacting with shorter dsrna molecules  <cit> . four recent reports have pointed towards limitations to using rnai as a tool in mammalian cells. the first demonstrated off-target gene silencing  <cit> , highlighting the redundancy of short nucleotide sequences in the human transcriptome. the second characterised the expression profile of genes as a result of lentiviral vector-mediated rnai. interferon regulated gene expression was increased even with dsrnas as short as  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . the third report demonstrated similar interferon response gene up-regulation, after transfection of cell lines with synthetic sirnas as short as  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . finally, scacheri et al documented significant sirna sequence-dependent changes in the expression of non-targeted proteins  <cit> .

in this work we used a simple approach for gene silencing in human tumor cell lines, using lentiviral vectors for stable delivery of shrnas. we aimed to study the effects of targeting the plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>  mrna on cell survival in the presence of pro-apoptotic stimuli. in addition to its inhibitory activity on the urokinase plasminogen activator, pai- <dig> is thought to have anti-apoptotic properties  <cit> . its molecular targets in this respect are unknown. a recent report demonstrated a functional interaction between pai- <dig> and the retinoblastoma protein cell cycle regulator  <cit> .

using lentiviral vectors for delivery of rnai-inducing expression cassettes we achieved potent pai- <dig> gene silencing, accompanied by a rapid cytotoxic effect. the degree of cytotoxicity was proportional to shrna length and induction of an interferon response gene could be detected when shrna of  <dig> complementary base pairs or more was expressed. the phenotype was not target gene specific, as pai- <dig> overexpression failed to rescue cytotoxicity and control hairpins were also cytotoxic. using lower vector titre, reduced shrna expression and interferon response induction was measured without compromising gene silencing. using a  <dig> complementary base pair shrna expression vector, which reduced pai- <dig> expression and induced no initial cytotoxicity or interferon response, transduced cell marker gene expression was maintained but gene silencing lost in long-term cell culture. our results highlight the need for careful controls to monitor specificity and maintenance of gene silencing when using rnai for stable loss-of-function studies in mammalian cells.

RESULTS
efficient transfer of rnai-inducing cassettes using lentiviral vectors
lentiviral vectors were generated which deliver an expression cassette for human u <dig> promoter-driven expression of short hairpin rna , with exact homology to the human pai- <dig> mrna. the vector expression cassette also bears the enhanced green fluorescent protein  gene under the control of the ef-1α promoter, and an internal ribosome entry site  sequence . this cassette allows permanent expression of gfp in transduced cells, and the possibility of concomitant overexpression of a further cdna, between the ef-1α promoter and ires sequences, not used here. the shrna sequences were chosen from the pai- <dig> mrna to include a 5' guanosine at the u <dig> promoter transcriptional start site, to exclude the 5' and 3'  <dig> nucleotides of the pai- <dig> open reading frame, and to be between  <dig> and  <dig> % guanosine/cytidine rich. as controls, we have used a vector leading to expression of gfp alone , a vector with the u <dig> promoter and transcriptional termination signals but lacking a hairpin encoding sequence , and vectors leading to expression of scrambled sequences of certain hairpins. figure  <dig> demonstrates the efficient transduction of isreco- <dig>  human colorectal carcinoma cells with one such pai- <dig> targeting vector . sh <dig> is designed for expression of a shrna with a  <dig> nucleotide double-stranded stretch  to target the pai- <dig> mrna. as controls, we used u6pt and a scrambled sequence  vector. four days after transduction, each cell population expressed high levels of gfp, as a marker for transduction . compared to non-transduced cells, or cells transduced with the u6pt control vector, we measured a clear knock-down of endogenous pai- <dig> protein and mrna in cells transduced with the sh <dig> vector .

however, the control vector with a scrambled sequence  also reduced pai- <dig> mrna and protein levels. equal sample loading for immunoblots was confirmed by ponceau s staining of nitrocellulose membranes  and the presence of equal amounts of a pai- <dig> monoclonal antibody-reactive non-specific band in each blot .

rapid cytotoxic effect of rnai vectors
many of the initial loss-of-function studies using rnai have measured the phenotypic effect of gene silencing in the immediate time frame after introduction of the sirna or rnai-inducing expression vector. as seen in figure  <dig>  four days after transduction with our vectors appears to be sufficient for efficient target gene silencing. transduction with lentiviral vectors leads to stable long-term integration of the desired transgene cassette, a key advantage in their use compared to other transient or less stable expression systems. thus we reasoned that transduction with rnai-inducing cassettes, using lentiviral vectors, would also be stable unless the reduction in target gene expression gave transduced cells a significant growth disadvantage or cytotoxic phenotype. four to five days after transduction, is- <dig> cells bearing the sh <dig> construct or cells transduced with a scrambled sh <dig> sequence rapidly changed morphology, compared to u6pt-transduced control cells. sh325-transduced cells began to disintegrate into small particles and detach from cell culture dishes. after  <dig> days most of the sh325-transduced cells were dead while the u6pt-transduced cells were growing like the parent cell line. the scrambled hairpin vector-transduced cells gave a weaker cytotoxic phenotype, with deteriorating cell morphology and some detachment of transduced cells. figure 2a shows the morphology of is- <dig> cells  <dig> days after transduction. to understand further this cytotoxic effect, we performed quantitative rt-pcr  on rna isolated from is- <dig> cells,  <dig> days after transduction with the same vectors, in order to measure the levels of the 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase- <dig>  mrna after transduction with each vector. the oas <dig> gene is recognised as an interferon response gene and has also been monitored elsewhere when using rnai  <cit> . we measured increases in oas <dig> expression in both sh <dig> and scrambled sh <dig> vector-transduced cells, whereas control-transduced cells  had equal oas <dig> levels to non-transduced cells .

 <dig> mer shrnas induce less cytotoxicity than longer hairpins and do not increase oas <dig> expression
as both the target gene-specific and the scrambled sequence  <dig> mer shrnas, sh <dig> and sh325scr, induced the oas <dig> interferon response gene, we generated further vectors for delivery of shrnas with reduced hairpin length. we reduced the length of sh <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides and named the novel vectors sh <dig>  sh <dig> and sh <dig>  respectively. the truncations were made at the 3' end of the  <dig> nucleotide sense strand and therefore the 5' of its complementary anti-sense sequence . each vector was used to transduce is- <dig> cells and the growth of gfp positive cells monitored at  <dig> and  <dig> days after transduction, compared to u6pt control-transduced cells . targeting of the pai- <dig> mrna and protein was monitored, four days after transduction, by qrt-pcr and immunoblotting of cell lysates . while each pai- <dig> targeted vector successfully reduced pai- <dig> mrna and protein four days after transduction, a strong negative selection was seen for shrna-expressing cells after a further six days of culture. this selective pressure on transduced cells was stronger with the  <dig> mer,  <dig> mer and  <dig> mer shrnas than with the shorter sh319-derived  <dig> mer . oas <dig> mrna levels were measured by qrt-pcr of transduced cell cdna four days after transduction . the cells transduced with the  <dig> mer,  <dig> mer and  <dig> mer shrnas showed induction of oas <dig> mrna, however, contrary to our expectations, highest oas <dig> levels were obtained with the  <dig> mer shrna. loss of gfp positive cells over time was comparable for  <dig> mer,  <dig> mer and  <dig> mer hairpin constructs.

to determine whether the lack of oas <dig> induction was specific to sh <dig> or common to other  <dig> mer shrnas, further transductions and qrt-pcr analysis were performed on mrna from is- <dig> cells transduced with sh <dig>  sh <dig> and sh319scr vectors. sh319scr encodes a shrna with a scrambled sh <dig> sequence. this analysis also confirms the specificity of the pai- <dig> silencing, by comparing sh <dig> to sh319scr. figure 3d shows that no induction of oas <dig> was measured using sh <dig> or sh319scr vectors and sh319scr had no effect on the pai- <dig> mrna level.

cytotoxicity is not target gene specific
to determine if all or part of the cytotoxic effect seen with our shrnas was due to down-regulation of pai- <dig>  we generated an is- <dig> cell line which overexpresses functional pai- <dig>  a lentiviral vector was produced which delivers the wild type pai- <dig> cdna, and used to transduce is- <dig> cells. this resulted in a homogeneous population of cells which overexpress pai- <dig> . using immunoblotting of pai-2/u-pa complexes, formed by mixing is- <dig> pai- <dig> cell lysates with low molecular weight u-pa, we demonstrated that this overexpressed protein was functional . we transduced these cells with the series of shrna-delivering vectors described in figure  <dig> , to test whether functional pai- <dig> overexpression could reverse the cytotoxic phenotype. as even endogenous pai- <dig> is not completely silenced using these vectors we reasoned that the rnai they deliver would not be capable of functionally silencing overexpressed pai- <dig>  as predicted, our pai- <dig> targeting shrnas were unable to completely reduce the overexpressed pai- <dig> protein levels . however, the cytotoxic effect seen with the parent is- <dig> cell line was also clearly apparent in the pai- <dig> overexpressing cells. we monitored the loss of gfp positive cells in the transduced pai- <dig> overexpressing cell populations and saw almost identical kinetics, compared to the parent cell line . these data show that the cytotoxic effect is not target gene specific. we also measured the level of pai- <dig> mrna in this experiment, by qrt-pcr. despite a several-fold decrease in overexpressed pai- <dig> protein level  we were unable to detect knock-down of the overexpressed mrna . in a similar manner to the is- <dig> parent cell line, transduction of pai- <dig> overexpressing cells with sh <dig>  sh <dig>  sh <dig>  but not the sh <dig> vector, induced the oas <dig> interferon response gene . to exclude is- <dig> cell-specific effects of our vectors we transduced is- <dig> cells and hela cells with a gfp control, the sh <dig> and the sh <dig> scrambled sequence  vectors. we monitored the percentage of gfp positive cells at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after transduction and observed similar selective loss of gfp positive cells for the sh <dig> and sh319scr vectors, in both cell lines .

reducing lentiviral vector titre can reduce shrna expression level and oas <dig> induction, while maintaining gene silencing
to understand whether lentiviral vector titre and resulting shrna expression levels influence the non-specific effects described, is- <dig> cells were transduced with the u6pt, sh <dig> and sh <dig> vectors as described above and also using a 10-fold reduction in vector titre . both sh <dig> and sh <dig> vectors effectively down-regulate pai- <dig>  but only the sh <dig> vector induces oas <dig> expression . using 10-fold lower vector titre had little impact on pai- <dig> mrna silencing, as seen using qrt-pcr , and resulted in a small decrease in oas <dig> mrna induction  in sh321-transduced cells. to assess whether lower vector titre resulted in lower shrna expression, total rna from cells transduced with different titres of sh <dig> vector was subjected to rnase digestion after hybridization with a 32-p labelled rna probe, designed to protect the first  <dig> nucleotides of the sh <dig> shrna. upon hybridization, this "sh3" probe should protect short rna expressed in sh <dig> vector-transduced cells from rnase digestion. as negative controls, rna from u6pt-transduced cells was subjected to the rnase protection procedure, and the sh <dig> probe was treated with rnase without target rna. as a positive control a probe for the mir- <dig> mirna was constructed and used to detect endogenous mir- <dig> mirna in u6pt-transduced cells using the same protocol . sh <dig> probe-protected rna was detected in sh321-transduced cells. reducing the viral titre clearly reduced the expression of shrna and this correlated with reduced oas <dig> induction. sh <dig> probe-protected rna was not detected in control-transduced cells and the sh <dig> probe was completely digested in the absence of target rna . this data demonstrates that vector-derived shrna expression can be reduced without impacting gene silencing and that lower expression correlates with a reduced interferon response.

loss of long-term gene silencing despite persistent transduction marker gene expression
in an attempt to generate a cell line with stable pai- <dig> mrna silencing without interferon response induction, we generated additional vectors which deliver  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide shrnas targeting different regions of the pai- <dig> mrna. of these, the sh <dig> construct reduced pai- <dig> expression, did not induce oas <dig> and had no effect on cell morphology one week after transduction . in parallel, we transduced is- <dig> cells with the sh <dig> vector or a gfp control vector. we achieved high percentage transduction rates which were monitored for over two weeks . gfp positive cells, from control- and sh119-transduced populations were sorted twice, using flow cytometry, to further enrich the gfp positive population of each . sh119-transduced cells showed pai- <dig> gene silencing  <dig> days after transduction but not after one month of cell culture . gfp marker gene expression was maintained in both sorted cell populations. during the prolonged culture period we noticed that, while the percentage of gfp positive cells remained stable, the intensity of gfp detected was reduced in the sh119-transduced cells, compared to gfp alone controls . this was accompanied by a significant reduction in integrated vector copies . thus, although the marker protein was maintained at a reduced expression level, the prolonged culture period selected against cells with effective gene silencing. this suggests the presence of subtle cytotoxic effects of short dsrna expression which are not apparent in the initial post transduction period and are in the absence of interferon response gene induction. overexpression of pai- <dig> in the is- <dig> cells did not reduce the long-term selective effect on transduced cells or gfp expression levels in sh119-transduced cells .

discussion
here we report the use of lentiviral vectors for the delivery of expression cassettes designed for rnai-induced stable knock-down of gene expression. we undertook this approach because of the promise of rnai to easily create cell lines that are specifically deficient in one protein component. by using lentiviral vectors for shrna expression, high transduction efficiencies can be achieved, avoiding effects due to clonal selection of phenotypically different cells.

we successfully targeted the pai- <dig> mrna with the aim of studying the effects of reducing pai- <dig> activity on cell sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing stimuli. pai- <dig> activity has previously been implicated in protection from apoptosis  <cit> . the cytotoxic effect we observed, in cells transduced with rnai-inducing vectors, appeared to correlate well with the reduction in pai- <dig> protein levels. however, rapid selective growth pressure on cells bearing shrna constructs with scrambled sequences, having no complementarity to the pai- <dig> mrna, suggested non-specific effects rather than a pai-2-related phenotype. using gfp as a marker gene, delivered by all vectors, enabled very sensitive detection of selective effects on transduced cells even when initial cell culture suggested stable transduction and cell growth.

we were able to detect increased expression of an interferon response gene, oas <dig>  in cells transduced with all hairpins of  <dig> or more base-paired nucleotides. a  <dig> mer hairpin induced the most potent oas <dig> induction. these results, and those of others  <cit> , suggest that dsrnas of less than  <dig> nucleotides can induce an interferon response, even if they cannot directly activate protein kinase r  <cit> . the absence of oas <dig> induction in cells transduced with  <dig> mer shrnas implies that the search for appropriate hairpin sequences should be limited to stretches of this length or less.

overexpression of functional pai- <dig> did not rescue the cytotoxic effects or oas <dig> induction observed in cells transduced with a series of vectors for expression of different length shrnas. this result, the cytotoxicity associated with scrambled sequence hairpin-encoding constructs, and the same selective pressure seen on the growth of transduced hela cells, which do not express detectable pai- <dig> mrna or protein , lead us to conclude that the phenotype we have seen in is- <dig> cells is not pai-2-specific. without the ability to track transduced cells, via gfp expression, this conclusion would have been more difficult to obtain. in cells engineered to overexpress functional pai- <dig>  our rnai-inducing vectors clearly reduced pai- <dig> protein levels but did not significantly reduce the overexpressed pai- <dig> mrna. this suggests that in the presence of high concentrations of targeted mrna, the machinery necessary for rnai-induced mrna cleavage is saturated and mrna down-regulation undetectable. as protein levels are nevertheless reduced, the shrna may be functioning post-transcriptionally, perhaps in a similar manner to natural mirna. this phenomenon has been described elsewhere for sirnas  <cit> .

is- <dig> cell transduction, using one pai- <dig> targeting vector , initially appeared stable, compared to control-transduced cells. pai- <dig> protein levels were clearly reduced  <dig> days after transduction and selective pressure on cell growth appeared to be minimal, as the percentage of sh <dig> gfp positive cells was apparently stable at about  <dig> %,  <dig> days after transduction. however, after cell sorting of gfp positive cells and prolonged cell culture of over one month after transduction, the pai- <dig> antigen measured in sh119s  cells was restored to control-transduced cell levels. despite maintenance of transduction marker expression, gene silencing was absent. the gfp expression levels in selected sh119s cells was reduced after one month of growth, compared to cells monitored three days after transduction. it is possible that we selected cells with a greatly reduced, non-cytotoxic shrna expression level, as we have detected a reduced number of integrated vector copies. the negative selective effect on cells transduced with the sh <dig> vector was not due to the suppression of pai- <dig> expression, as pai- <dig> overexpressing cells showed the same negative selection.

in all experiments in which a selective pressure on growth was apparent on shrna-expressing cells, reduced percentage gfp positive cells and reduced gfp expression in transduced cells was measured over time. we hypothesised that very high expression levels of the various shrnas is cytotoxic. this could occur via high numbers of transcriptionally active vector integration events or integration at transcriptionally active chromosomal regions. both might be controlled using a tightly regulatable expression system, which has been described  <cit> , but may require careful dosage in a gene- and cell-specific manner.

our data demonstrate the importance of appropriate controls for using rnai, as proposed in a recent editorial  <cit> . these include suppression of the rnai phenotype by target gene overexpression, use of scrambled dsrnas, and monitoring of non-specific gene expression in particular of interferon-responsive genes such as oas <dig>  also, if considering the use of stable rnai, it is imperative that stable knock-down is demonstrated as well as stable marker gene expression. in the cell culture system we used, conclusions drawn from experiments several days after rnai delivery mask effects which are only apparent days later by monitoring the percentage of transduced cells. such effects are likely be present in experiments using regulatable rnai systems or using exogenously added dsrna, where the experimental data linked to gene targeting may be collected before other effects are seen. the molecular events which lead to the long-term effect we have documented may well be underway during this experimental period.

in the light of our own data and other recent reports  <cit> , solutions for the induced cytotoxic effects we describe here include testing a series of target sequences, using dsrna of no more than  <dig> nucleotides at low effective vector doses, and careful monitoring of transduced cell phenotype with and without functional target gene overexpression. long-term monitoring of gene silencing appears to be necessary in stable systems, even in the presence of marker gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates vector-derived rnai in tumor cell lines and points towards the necessity of careful, but clearly feasible, controls when using rnai for stable gene suppression in short- and long-term experiments.
