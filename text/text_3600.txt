BACKGROUND
citrus canker, caused by the gram-negative plant pathogenic bacterium xanthomonas citri subsp. citri    <cit> , is one of the most important diseases of citrus crop worldwide  <cit> . citrus canker is widely distributed in wet subtropical citrus growing areas and affects most commercial citrus varieties  <cit> . the canker symptom is characterized by raised necrotic lesions on leaves, stems and fruit of infected trees; and in severe cases, defoliation, twig dieback, general tree decline, blemished fruit and premature fruit drop can occur  <cit> . wind-blown rain is the primary short- to medium-distance spread mechanism for citrus canker and long-distance dissemination is usually caused by transportation of infected citrus fruits and plant materials  <cit> . the decrease of yield and less value or entirely unmarketable of infected fruit are responsible for serious economic losses  <cit> . moreover, this disease has a significant impact on commerce due to restrictions to national and international fruit trade from canker-affected areas  <cit> . economic losses are also resulting from costly eradication programs and heave use of chemical treatments such as copper-based bactericides for prevention from and control of citrus canker disease  <cit> .

several members of the genus xanthomonas, including xac, have been extensively studied as model organisms to dissect the mechanisms of bacterium-plant interactions, including the molecular basis of pathogenesis and plant disease resistance  <cit> . xac is considered to be a hemibiotrophic pathogen because it is able to obtain nutrients from living host cells, multiply in the apoplast  and then infect neighbouring tissues, after invading citrus host directly through natural openings, such as stomata, and through wounds  <cit> . the apoplast is a nutrient-limited environment that is guarded by plant defenses  <cit> . xac, like many other plant pathogenic bacteria, has evolved several strategies to adapt to and successfully colonize this in planta niche by overcoming the plant defense and creating a favourable environment for bacterial growth, which include, among others, the type iii secretion system  and its effectors, cell wall degrading enzymes, and bacterial polysaccharides  <cit> . bacterial polysaccharides of plant pathogenic bacteria, including extracellular polysaccharides , lipopolysaccharides  and capsular polysaccharides , have been shown to play a role in a number of different diseases. they collectively or individually contribute to the bacterial growth and survival in planta, and also are involved in the bacterium-plant interaction  <cit> .

progress has been made in elucidating the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides over the decades  <cit> . the biosynthesis of bacterial polysaccharides occurs in successive steps. firstly, nucleotide sugars are produced, which provide specifically activated monosaccharides as precursors for the subsequent synthesis steps. secondly, monosaccharide moieties from the nucleotide sugar precursors are sequentially transferred by highly specific glycosyltransferases  to sugar or nonsugar acceptors, resulting in the formation of saccharide repeating units. finally, the repeating units are polymerized and the polymer is exported from the cell. bacterial gts have been reported to be involved not only in the biosynthesis of eps, lps, cps, peptidoglycans, and glycolipids, but also in protein and lipid glycosylation, showing enormous diversity of biological functions and substrates  <cit> .

much effort has been made to identify genes that encode gts, their enzymatic functions, and the structures of these enzymes. currently, there are more than  <dig> gt families in the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database  based on amino acid sequence similarities  <cit> . two main three-dimensional folds, named gt-a and gt-b, have been observed for structures of nucleotide sugar-dependent gts  <cit> . there is high sequence variability, although the relatively low structural variety and it is not yet possible to reliably predict the precise function of a given gt.

mutations in gts encoding genes have profound biological effects in a variety of bacteria. for example, mutation in spsa of bacillus subtilis resulted in an altered spore coat  <cit> . in escherichia coli strain  <dig> , an aah-deletion mutant was attenuated in adherence to host cells  <cit> , and the pgac mutant of e. coli k- <dig> was impaired in surface binding, intercellular adhesion, and biofilm formation  <cit> . mutation of orfn in pseudomonas aeruginosa pak affected the flagellin glycosylation  <cit> . in x. campestris pv. campestris strain  <dig>  mutation of xagb  led to decreased eps production, abolished biofilm formation and attenuated bacterial resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> , and the xc_ <dig> mutant was significantly reduced both in eps production and virulence on host plants  <cit> ; while the rfbc mutation in xac strain  <dig> resulted in altered o-antigen of lps, reduced biofilm formation and attenuated bacterial resistance to environmental stresses  <cit> .

in our previous work, an ez-tn <dig> transposon mutant of xac strain  <dig> with an insertion in the xac <dig> locus was isolated in a screening that aimed at identifying genes involved in biofilm formation. the xac <dig> locus was named as bdp <dig> for biofilm-defective phenotype and the mutant was observed to be affected in eps and lps biosynthesis, cell motility and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces  <cit> . due to the nature of our previous study in genome-wide identification of biofilm related genes, we focused on big picture rather than individual genes. it is necessary to further characterize the novel genes identified in our previous study and provide conclusive genetic evidence in complementation. in this study, we further characterized the bdp <dig>  gene  that encodes a putative glycosyltransferase using genetic complementation assays. the data obtained confirmed that the novel gene gpsx plays a role in eps and lps biosynthesis, cell motility, biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces and host leaves, stress tolerance, growth in planta, and host virulence of the citrus canker bacterium. these findings suggest that the gpsx gene contributes to the adaptation of xac to the host microenvironments at early stage of infection and thus is required for full virulence on host plants.

RESULTS
the gpsx gene encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis in x. citri subsp. citri
the xac <dig> locus was identified as a biofilm formation-related gene of bdp <dig> that may be involved in eps and lps biosynthesis, following screening a transposon insertion mutant library of xac strain  <dig> in our earlier work  <cit> . the xac <dig> open reading frame  is  <dig> bp in length and located in the genome sequence at position 3655217- <dig> . xac <dig> consists of a single transcriptional unit, whereas the adjacent upstream and downstream genes were transcribed separately from this orf in reverse orientation  <cit> . xac <dig> was annotated as a  <dig> aa glycosyltransferase  <cit> . the predicted pi and molecular weight  of the putative enzyme are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd , respectively. the predicted protein contained a glycosyltransferase family  <dig> domain   at the n-terminal and a udp-glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase superfamily domain   at the c-terminal . in addition, psi-blast analysis revealed that the xac <dig> belongs to glycosyltransferase family ii  in the pfam protein family database  <cit> . the predicted xac <dig> protein processes several conserved catalytic residues of glycosyltransferases including the dxd motif  for the divalent metal ion binding in glycosyltransferases with a common gt-a structural fold  <cit>  . database search revealed that xac <dig> are highly conserved in other sequenced xanthomonas species, including x. oryzae, x. campestris, x. fuscans, x. perforans, x. vesicatoria, x. gardneri, and x. albilineans, with over 70% amino acid identity . all these homologues are putative glycosyltransferases with unknown functions. their homologues with about 35-70% identity are also present in acetobacter aceti, clostridium spp., xylella fastidiosa, chlorobium phaeobacteroides, saccharopolyspora erythraea, thiorhodococcus drewsii, rhodospirillum centenum, stenotrophomonas spp., and burkholderia spp.; among which, several are putative gt- <dig> proteins . these findings strongly suggested that xac <dig> may be a member of gt- <dig>  collectively, given the role in polysaccharide production , the bdp <dig>  gene was renamed as gpsx .

to exclude the possibility of multiple ez-tn <dig> insertions in the genome of the gpsx mutant  <dig> g <dig>  , complementation assays were performed for this mutant. the complementary plasmid pju <dig> with intact gpsx  was transformed into the mutant  <dig> g <dig> , and the complemented strain c223g <dig>  was assayed for eps and lps production. the results showed that the total eps production of the gpsx mutant in nb containing 2% glucose at  <dig> hours post inoculation could be restored to the wild-type level by the plasmid pju <dig>  but not by the empty vector pufr <dig> . both the mutant strains  <dig> g <dig>  and 223g4v  produced significantly less eps than the wild-type strain  <dig>  the complemented strain c223g <dig>  had a similar level of eps production to the wild-type strain. sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis showed that lps of the gpsx mutant was different from that of the wild-type strain  <dig> . two bands corresponding to the o-antigen containing lps were completely lost in the gpsx mutant, compared to wild type strain  <dig>  the lps pattern of the complemented gpsx mutant was similar with that of the wild-type strain  <dig>  the empty vector pufr <dig> did not complement lps biosynthesis in the gpsx mutant . these findings indicated that the transposon insertion mutation in gpsx could be complemented by the wild type orf in trans and, the gpsx locus is involved in polysaccharides biosynthesis in x. citri subsp. citri.

to further confirm the role of gpsx in polysaccharides biosynthesis, the eps production of the mutants grown in xvm <dig> liquid medium supplemented with 2% of various carbohydrates was quantitatively estimated. as summarized in table  <dig>  the gpsx mutant produced about 30-50% less eps than the wild-type strain  <dig> when cultured in fructose-, galactose-, glucose-, maltose-, mannose-, or sucrose-containing medium; while the eps yield of the complemented mutant strains showed no significant difference from that of the wild-type. in contrast, no significant difference in capsule staining was observed between the gpsx mutant strain and the wild-type strain  <dig> in capsule assays .

a strains were cultured in xvm <dig> liquid medium supplemented with various carbon sources. data presented are means and standard errors of three replicates from one representative experiment and similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments. different letters in each data column indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  .

gpsx was required for full virulence and growth of x. citri subsp. citri in host plants
since both eps and lps have been demonstrated to contribute to host virulence of x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> , we were interested in determining whether the gpsx gene is associated with pathogenicity of the canker bacterium. the virulence of the gpsx mutant was assessed on the host plant grapefruit using two inoculation methods: pressure infiltration and spray. upon infiltration at a concentration  <dig> colony-forming units /ml, no disease symptom was observed on the gpsx mutant or wild type strain inoculated leaves at  <dig> days post inoculation ; however, the gpsx mutant induced less canker lesions than the wild-type strain  <dig> at  <dig> dpi . when infiltrated at a higher concentration , the gpsx mutant induced significantly less lesions than wild type at  <dig> dpi, but caused similar disease symptoms as wild type at  <dig> dpi. in both cases, the complemented mutant strain with the intact gpsx cloned in pufr <dig> showed no difference from the wild type strain . plant inoculation by spray, a method that mimics the natural infection, showed that the gpsx mutant was reduced in virulence on grapefruit compared with the wild-type strain  <dig>  after  <dig> days post inoculation the number of canker lesions on leaves infected with the gpsx mutant was significantly less than that inoculated with wild type strain. symptom induction by the gpsx mutant could be restored to the wild-type level by complementary plasmid pju <dig>  but not by the empty vector .

although there were no differences between the wild type and the gpsx mutant strains in the ability to grow in xvm <dig> medium , the growth of gpsx mutant  <dig> g <dig>  was significantly reduced in planta compared to the growth of the wild-type strain. after inoculation by infiltration at  <dig> cfu/ml, the bacterial population of the gpsx mutant moderately reduced in planta, and between  <dig> and  <dig> h, the bacterial population began to increase; whereas the bacterial population of the wild type strain  <dig> continued to increase after inoculation . the bacterial population of the gpsx mutant recovered from the infected leaves was approximately  <dig> to 100-fold lower than that of the wild-type strain at each of the test points . similar differences in growth of the wild type and mutant strains were observed following infiltration at  <dig> cfu/ml . the bacterial population of the complemented strain was similar to that of the wild-type at each test point . the populations of the gpsx mutant compared to wild type strain were also analyzed after inoculation via spraying and significant differences were observed. as shown in figure 5c, after inoculation, the population of the wild type strain remained approximately constant until  <dig> dpi, whereas the population of the gpsx mutant declined significantly. at  <dig> dpi, the population size of the gpsx mutant was nearly  <dig> times lower than for the wild type strain. from that point forward, the population sizes of the gpsx mutant began to increase slowly, whereas growth of the wild type strain continued after inoculation, so that, at  <dig> dpi, the difference in population size was one to two orders of magnitude. the affected growth of the gpsx mutant was restored to wild type levels by complementation with the cloned gpsx gene . overall, these findings suggest that gpsx is required for x. citri subsp. citri to proliferate well and to achieve full virulence in host plants.

mutation in gpsx affected biofilm formation of x. citri subsp. citri on abiotic surfaces and host leaves
biofilm has been well characterized as a virulence trait in many plant pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . our earlier study indicated that gpsx is related to biofilm formation  <cit> . in order to confirm the role of gpsx in biofilm formation in x. citri subsp. citri, biofilm formation of the gpsx mutant was examined on three different kinds of surfaces: polystyrene, glass and host leaves. the gpsx mutant  <dig> g <dig>  exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm formation both on polystyrene surface and in glass tubes compared to that of the wild-type, where the level of biofilm formation were approximately 30% and 40% of the wild-type level, respectively; and the complemented c223g <dig>  strains were restored to levels similar to that of the wild-type strain . similar to the observations on polystyrene surface and in glass tubes, the gpsx mutant showed declined biofilm formation on citrus leaf surfaces and, the complemented c223g <dig>  strains were restored the wild-type levels , suggesting that the gpsx gene is involved in biofilm formation of x. citri subsp. citri cells on citrus leaves. these findings confirmed that the gpsx gene is involved in biofilm formation in x. citri subsp. citri.

mutation of gpsx caused impairment in cell motility but no impact on flagellar formation
several studies have indicated that both eps and lps are associated with the flagella-independent motility in a couple of bacteria including x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . to verify whether a mutation in gpsx has any effect on the cell motility of x. citri subsp. citri, the gpsx mutant was evaluated for the mobile ability on swimming and swarming plates, respectively. the results showed that a significant reduction  both in swimming and swarming motility was observed in the gpsx mutant  <dig> g <dig> , compared with the wild-type strain . on the tested plates, the diameter of the growth zones resulting from migration away from the inoculation points on the agar surface were about  <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  cm  for the gpsx mutant, and  <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  cm  for the wild type. the diameter of the complemented strain and the wild-type strain were not significantly different, indicating that the mobility of the mutant could be restored to wild-type levels by gpsx in trans. flagellum visualization assays using transmission electron microscope  showed that both the wild-type and the gpsx mutant strains formed a polar flagellum at the cell surface , suggesting that mutation of gpsx has no impact on flagellar formation in xac. these results indicated that the gpsx is implicated in bacterial motility in x. citri subsp. citri.

gpsx contributed to stress tolerance of x. citri subsp. citri
the decrease in bacterial population in planta of the gpsx mutant immediately after inoculation  suggested that the gpsx gene might play a role in the adaptation of x. citri subsp. citri to the conditions of the host microenvironments. to test this hypothesis, the survival of the gpsx mutant was investigated under various stresses that would be likely experienced at the early stage of infection when the bacteria has to attach to the leaf surface and later when the bacteria has to survive inside the host plant, including uv radiation, heat shock, saline stress, osmotic challenge, desiccation stress, sds exposure and the h2o <dig> oxidative stress. these assays revealed that the gpsx mutant  <dig> g <dig>  was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to uv radiation, heat shock, desiccation stress, sds exposure, and h2o <dig> . after  <dig> min of exposure to uv radiation, there were greater numbers of surviving cells of the wild-type strain than that of the gpsx mutant. following  <dig> min of exposure of bacteria to heat , viable cells of the gpsx mutant declined more rapidly than the wild-type. when exposed to air and dried for  <dig> min, the gpsx mutant showed significantly decreased survival compared with the wild-type strain. after treatment with sds  for  <dig> min, the survival rate of the gpsx mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild-type strain. the gpsx mutant also showed higher sensitivity than the wild type strain to hydrogen peroxide . the levels of stress tolerance of the complemented strain were similar to those of the wild type , indicating that the affected stress tolerance of the gpsx mutant could be restored by gpsx in trans. there were no differences between the gpsx mutant and wild type strain in survival under saline stress or osmotic challenge.

abacterial cell viability was estimated by plating on na agar before  and after  the treatment. percentage survival was calculated as the ratio of viable cell counts at t <dig> to that at t <dig>  the treatments were applied as follows: for uv radiation, overnight bacterial culture was exposed to short-wave uv irradiation  for  <dig> min; for heat-shock, bacterial culture was incubated at 50°c for  <dig> min; for desiccation stress, bacterial culture was placed on glass coverslips and air dried in a laminar flow apparatus for  <dig> min and then resuspended in  <dig> % nacl and plated; for sds exposure, bacterial culture was treated with  <dig> % sds for  <dig> min; for sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, bacterial culture was exposed to  <dig> % h2o <dig> for  <dig> min; for osmotic stress, bacterial culture was treated with 40% d-sorbitol for  <dig> min; for saline stress, bacterial culture was treated with  <dig>  m nacl for  <dig> min. bacterial cells were serially diluted with nb medium and colony-forming units  were counted after being cultured on na plates at 28°c for  <dig> h. each test, plated in triplicate, was repeated three times with similar results. b data shown are means and standard errors of three replicates from one representative experiment. different letters in each data column indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  .

mutation of gpsx has no impact on expression of virulence-related genes
reduced virulence could result from down-regulation of key virulence genes. in order to test whether mutation of the gpsx gene affected the expression of virulence-related genes, quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  assays were performed to monitor the expression profiles of six genes which were selected based on the alternated mutant phenotypes mentioned above. for total rna preparation, the gpsx mutant and wild type strains were cultured to exponential phase in xvm <dig> medium that has been reported to mimic the environment of plant intercellular spaces  <cit> . the six target genes included one eps biosynthesis gene , one lps synthesis gene , one catalase gene , one ttss component gene , one ttss regulator genes hrpx, and one ttss effector gene . the results showed that none of the six genes was significantly differently expressed in the mutant  <dig> g <dig>  compared with wild-type strains when grown in xvm <dig> medium , based on a student's t-test . specifically, the primer set used for ptha is present in ptha <dig> and its homologues ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  and ptha <dig>  but not in any other genes. thus we refer it as ptha rather than differentiating them. the qrt-pcr result based on this primer should detect the expression of ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  and ptha <dig>  it is very likely that ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  and ptha <dig> have similar gene expression pattern due to the same promoter sequences. the sequences are 100% identical in the  <dig> bp upstream of ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  and ptha <dig> including the predicated promoter region . consequently, the qrt-pcr result will represent the relative fold change in gene expression for ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  and/or ptha <dig> since it is relative fold change and not absolute expression value.

a both 16s rrna and gyra genes were used as endogenous controls in the qrt-pcr experiments and similar results were obtained when the data were normalized against the two genes respectively. only the data obtained with 16s rrna gene as control were shown.

discussion
in this work we have extended the characterization of the xac <dig> gene locus, previously identified and named bdp <dig> for involvement in xac biofilm formation  <cit> . we conclude from several independent lines of evidence that this gene is required for eps and lps biosynthesis, and consequently required for biofilm formation and full virulence of xac on host plants. for this reason, we have changed the name of this gene to gpsx, for glycosyltransferase for polysaccharide synthesis in xac, to reflect the apparent multiple function of the gene product.

several lines of evidence indicate that the gpsx locus is involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. first, gpsx contains a glycosyltransferase family  <dig> domain and shares the conserved catalytic residues of glycosyltransferases . second, mutation of gpsx resulted in decreased production of eps  and altered lps synthesis , consistent with the general role of glycosyltransferases in polysaccharide biosynthesis  <cit> . third, similar genes associated with polysaccharide biosynthesis have been identified in other bacterial pathogens . homologues of gpsx widely occur in the genomes of related phytopathogenic bacteria of xanthomonas . the biochemical characteristics and physiological roles of these homologous proteins remain unknown.

some glycosyltransferase genes have already been identified in xanthomonas spp. for example, as mentioned previously, the rfbc gene encodes a glycosyltransferase, which serves as a truncated o-antigen biosynthesis protein involved in lps production in x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . both the orfs xc_ <dig> and xc_ <dig>  in x. campestris pv. campestris are implicated in eps production, but not lps production  <cit> . in addition, the gumdmhki genes encode different glycosyltransferases that direct the biosynthesis of the xanthan eps in x. campestris pv. campestris  <cit> . however, these enzymes in xanthomonas are mono-functional, i.e., involved either in eps or lps production. our data showed that the gpsx gene is involved in both eps and lps production . the low similarities between gpsx and these proteins  may suggest the differences in substrates and products.

bacterial polysaccharides are usually synthesized from intracellular nucleotide sugar precursors and, most bacterial polysaccharides contain polymerized saccharide repeating units, the assembly of which involves glycosyltransferases that sequentially link monosaccharide moieties from nucleotide sugars to the growing sugar chain   <cit> . different classes of bacterial polysaccharides can be distinguished on basis of their biosynthesis mechanisms and the precursors required. however, it is worth mentioning that, in some instances, mutation of single genes simultaneously affected biosynthesis of different polysaccharides, similar with the observation in this work. for example, in x. campestris pv. citrumelo, the mutation in opsx, a homologue of waaf  which codes for a heptosyltransferase for lps synthesis in e. coli, affected biosynthesis of lps and eps  <cit> . in addition, mutants in xana and xanb, involved in udp-glucose and gdp-mannose biosynthesis in x. campestris pv. campestris, respectively, showed a decrease in eps production and an altered lps  <cit> . mutants in gale, encoding a udp-galactose epimerase in erwinia amylovora, were deficient in eps production and produced a lps with an altered side chain structure  <cit> . the dual effect of certain genes on eps and lps may be due to the shared pathways for eps and lps synthesis in these bacteria. as discovered in salmonella, the same precursor molecule, udp-glucose, is used for lps o-antigen polysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide  <cit> . the major eps produced by xanthomonads, xanthan, composed of polymerized pentasaccharide repeating units, consisting of glucose, mannose and glucuronic acid  <cit> . most recently, glucose and mannose were found to be components of lps in x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . given the altered o-antigen containing lps profile of the gpsx mutant and its decreased level of eps production, it was likely that the gpsx-encoded glycosyltransferase was involved in the formation of saccharide repeating units that might be found in x. citri subsp. citri eps and lps, by transferring the glucose and/or mannose monosaccharide moiety from certain nucleotide sugar precursors to corresponding acceptors. however, biochemical evidence for this proposed function of gpsx is needed.

interestingly, the gpsx gene is located outside of the lps gene cluster even though it is involved in the o-antigen biosynthesis. the lps cluster is responsible for synthesis of o-antigen polysaccharide. the locus presents a size of  <dig>  kb and contains  <dig> orf  <cit> . the lps cluster contains three glycosyltransferases, i.e. xac <dig> , orf <dig>  and xac <dig>  rfbc was annotated as a 614-amino-acid truncated o-antigen biosynthesis protein containing two separate glycosyltransferase family  <dig>  domains. the involvement of rfbc in o-antigen biosynthesis has been confirmed in our previous study  <cit> . the orf <dig> has been annotated to encode a putative glycosyltransferase  <cit> , whereas xac <dig> shows significant homology to the glycosyltransferase a  family  <cit> . it remains to be determined how gpsx and other glycosyltransferases are involved in o-antigen biosynthesis in xac.

the attenuation in virulence and growth in planta of the gpsx mutant both in epiphytic  and wound  inoculations  may result, at least partially if not completely, from the reduction in eps production  and the alteration of lps profile , and consequently impaired cell motility  and biofilm formation , rather than from an effect on the virulence genes . eps has been shown to act as an important virulence factor that contributes to epiphytic survival and/or bacterial in planta growth and disease symptom formation in several xanthomonas spp. including x. campestris pv. campestris, x. oryzae pv. oryzae, and x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . eps can suppress plant basal defense responses by chelating divalent calcium that are require for the activation of plant defense responses  <cit> . it also contributes to biofilm formation  <cit> , which promotes bacterial resistance to environment stresses  <cit> . lps has also been shown to be an important virulence factor in various plant pathogenic bacteria including several xanthomonas spp.  <cit> , erwinia amylovora  <cit>  and pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . it can serve as a physical barrier protecting bacteria from plant defense responses  <cit> . it may also contribute to biofilm formation  <cit> . in addition, both eps and lps are related to cell motility in a couple of bacteria including x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . in certain phytopathogenic bacteria, e.g., e. amylovora, p. syringae, and ralstonia solanacearum, motility has been suggested to contribute to bacterial virulence in the early stages such as invasion and colonization  <cit> . x. citri subsp. citri is an intercellular space-colonizing pathogen that invades host plants via stomata or wounds, and multiplies in the apoplasts  <cit> . before entering the host, the pathogen persists as epiphytes on the plant surface and has to confront environment stresses. once entering the host, the pathogen needs to tolerate preformed defense molecules to establish a successful infection. therefore, the alteration of lps of the gpsx mutant and the reduction in its ability to produce eps and to form biofilm formation may attenuate its adaptation to the conditions of the host microenvironment, which result in its growth deficiency, and consequently reduced virulence. consistent with this, it has been demonstrated that both eps and lps biosyntheses are required for growth and survival on leaf surfaces and full virulence in x. citri subsp. citri  <cit> . finally, gpsx may aid bacterial survival at early stage of infection when the bacterium attaches to the leaf surface and later survives inside the plant tissue. consistent with the hypothesis, the gpsx mutant was attenuated in resistance against various stresses including oxidative stress , which is one of the early plant defense responses triggered by bacterial infections  <cit> .

in summary, in this work we expanded the knowledge about the function of the novel glycosyltransferase encoding gene gpsx from x. citri subsp. citri. based on its apparently unique function in polysaccharide synthesis and the widely conserved occurrence in sequenced strains of xanthomonas, this enzyme may represent a novel virulence-related factor of phytopathogenic xanthomonas including x. citri subsp. citri. additional study of this gene and its protein product should yield new insights into the biochemistry and physiological roles of bacterial glycosyltransferase of the citrus canker bacterium x. citri subsp. citri.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we characterized the novel gpsx gene in x. citri subsp. citri. we demonstrated that the gpsx mutant is affected in eps and lps production, cell motility, biofilm formation, stress tolerance, growth in planta, and virulence on host plants and that the genetic complementation with the wild type gpsx gene, fully restored the affected phenotypes of the gpsx mutant to wild-type levels. in conclusion, the gpsx gene is important for polysaccharide synthesis and biofilm formation and thus, plays an important role in the adaptation of x. citri subsp. citri to the host microenvironments at early stage of infection and required for full virulence on host plants.
