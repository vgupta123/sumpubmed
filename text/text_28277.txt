BACKGROUND
the developing cerebral cortex is highly compartmentalized and involves precise regulation of cell proliferation, migration and differentiation
 <cit> . the behaviour of cells undergoing these neurodevelopmental processes is governed by spatiotemporal changes in gene expression
 <cit> . translation and intracellular traffic of these transcripts is influenced by small non-coding mirna that function as molecular guide sequences for ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in targeted mrna degradation or translational repression . by regulating mrnas post-transcriptional fate, mirna subsequently play a significant role in organizing complex patterns of gene activity. thus these small rna molecules also display distinct expression profiles
, and exhibit both temporal and spatial specificity
. for example, mir- <dig> has been demonstrated to play a role in controlling neurogenesis timing via targeting of progenitor-promoting and cell-cycle exit-promoting genes
 <cit> . accordingly, its expression has been shown to increase during neurodevelopment, but not in the postnatal period
 <cit> , and to be regionally restricted to telencephalic, diencephalic and tectal periventricular proliferative zones
 <cit> .

analysis of mirna and their target mrna expression in neuronal cell cultures supports a regulatory role for mirnas in neuronal development
. consistent with this role, a number of neural-specific or neural-enriched mirnas have been identified
 <cit>  and are thought to be involved in regulating early brain development . for example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> regulate neuronal maturation through the modulation of their target mrna. the brain-specific mir- <dig> regulates dendritic spine development by repressing the translation of an mrna encoding a protein kinase, limk <dig>  that controls spine development
 <cit> , while the brain-enriched mir- <dig> has a significant role in neuronal maturation and dendritic morphogenesis via direct targeting of mib <dig>  a ubiquitin ligase important for neurogenesis and neurodevelopment
 <cit> . this supports existing evidence for the role of mirnas in neurogenesis
 <cit> , morphogenesis
 <cit> , neuronal cell specification
 <cit>  and oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination
 <cit> .

in the current study we wanted to determine if mirna and their predicted targets are altered in accordance with their developmental stage and neurodevelopmental regionalization. more specifically we compare developmental mirna and gene expression in the caudal regions including the mesencephalon and metencephalon that develop relatively early, with more rostral areas such as the telencephalon and diencephalon which develop later
 <cit> , as we hypothesize that mirna are the subject of related spatiotemporal regulation. by matching mirnas with their inversely-regulated mrna targets, we suggest that mirna’s post-transcriptional regulatory influence changes throughout neurodevelopment, with a pattern of expression in the developing telencephalon occurring after that of the mesencephalon in accordance with their respective cytoarchitectural and synaptic maturity.

it is critical for the development and use of rodents as animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders that we have a good understanding of the nature and timing of regional differentiation in the rodent brain. predicting neurodevelopmental events and recognizing differing windows of vulnerability to environmental insults will help develop clinically relevant experimental models.

RESULTS
temporal dynamics of mirna expression in the telencephalon and mesencephalon between e <dig> and p0
mirna expression was analysed in the telencephalon and mesencephalon of embryonic   and newborn  day 0) rats using genechip mirna array matrices . data analysis revealed  <dig> mirna in the telencephalon and  <dig> in the mesencephalon with differential expression during brain development. mirna expression displayed greater variation in the telencephalon  compared to the mesencephalon  throughout development , with  <dig> mirna in the telencephalon having substantive temporal variance  across development as compared to  <dig> mirna in the mesencephalon. there were also a number of mirna with altered expression specific to the telencephalon. this occurred at e <dig>  and e <dig>  only. in contrast the mesencephalon had no region-specific mirna expression at any time during the developmental timepoints examined. furthermore we also observed stage-associated expression in the telencephalon-specific mirna, with  <dig> and  <dig> expressed only at e <dig> or e <dig> respectively . to gain an appreciation of the biological implications of these telencephalon-specific mirna during early telencephalon development, putative target genes of the  <dig> mirna specific to the telencephalon at e <dig> and the  <dig> mirna specific to the telencephalon at e <dig> were assessed for kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment using the gene annotation tool to help explain relationships  online database. for the telencephalon-specific mirna at e <dig> this revealed a number of significantly enriched pathways with relevance to neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity, such as focal adhesion; adherens junction; oxidative phosphorylation; regulation of actin cytoskeleton and ecm-receptor signalling. similarly, the telencephalon-specific mirna at e <dig> were predicted to be enriched in the mitogen-activated protein  kinase signalling pathway and wingless/int  signalling pathway . further analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis  software  revealed roles in important neurodevelopmental processes including: the differentiation of dopamine neurons; neuron and neuroglia differentiation; myelination; synaptogenesis; and axonogenesis .figure  <dig>

to determine those mirna that were differentially regulated with respect to developmental age, all mirna were ranked based on their temporal expression variance through e <dig> to p <dig>  mirna undergoing substantial changes throughout development  were selected for downstream analysis . the  <dig> mirna identified were found to have significantly lower expression  in the telencephalon compared to the mesencephalon at embryonic day  <dig> . supervised hierarchical clustering of these mirna was characterized by distinct expression clusters, two of which showed significantly lower expression  in the telencephalon compared to the mesencephalon at embryonic day  <dig> . prominent among this group were mirnas that are enriched in neurons and associated with developmental regulation , cell cycle regulation  and neural activity . bioinformatic analysis of these  <dig> mirna through ipa  identified  <dig> putative mirna target genes. gene ontology  function and kegg pathway enrichments were performed by mapping the predicted target genes from the developmentally regulated mirnas using the gather online database. for these mirnas and their predicted targets,  <dig> go functions and  <dig> kegg pathways were significant . the top ontologies included: regulation of cell cycle; development; morphogenesis; regulation of transcription; and neurogenesis .figure  <dig>

in summary, while we observed substantial overlap between mirna expressed in the telencephalon and mesencephalon, there was a number of functionally significant mirna expressed exclusively in the telencephalon. from longitudinal analysis in each brain region, it was also apparent that telencephalon mirna expression was subject to more temporal variation compared to the mesencephalon. genes predicted to respond to this developmental variation in telencephalon cortical mirna expression were enriched in pathways associated with neural development and function.

mrna expression was analysed in the telencephalon and mesencephalon of embryonic  and newborn  rats using ratref- <dig> expression beadchips . data analysis revealed a total of  <dig>  genes with differential expression during neural development , comprised of  <dig>  genes in the telencephalon and  <dig>  genes in the mesencephalon. to determine those genes that were differentially regulated with respect to developmental age, all mrna were ranked based on their temporal expression variance between e <dig> to p <dig>  those that demonstrated the greatest variation throughout development  were selected for bioinformatic evaluation . these  <dig> genes with high temporal expression dynamics were further assessed for their involvement in biological pathways. go function and kegg pathway enrichment of these genes revealed  <dig> significant  go functions and  <dig> kegg pathway . network analysis using ipa  for predicting potential interactions between the differentially expressed genes generated three networks with the highest ipa analysis scores  including cell-to-cell signalling and interaction; nervous system development and function; cellular growth and proliferation; and cellular development . while these biological processes accorded well with those predicted by the developmentally regulated mirna, we wanted to explore the possibility that these  <dig> dynamically expressed genes were most likely responding to changes in mirna expression and driving developmentally significant changes in cell morphology and physiology, by bioinformatically associating the putative interactions with observed changes in predicted relationships or mirna-mrna interactions.table  <dig>

mirna-mrna interactions
given that mirnas predominantly function to negatively regulate gene expression, we examined the biological significance of inverse expression patterns between differentially expressed mirna and differentially expressed genes in the telencephalon during development. we used ingenuity’s mirna target filter® to analyze all possible mirna and target-gene interactions from the mirna and gene expression array data sets. the results were filtered based on the confidence of interaction and an inverse mirna to target mrna relationship. these gene sets were then functionally annotated using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery bioinformatics resources  <dig>   online database, revealing significant over-representation in neural pathways throughout development. this included axon guidance, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, map kinase signalling, wnt signalling, long-term depression and calcium signalling .

we further investigated the putative roles of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the development of the telencephalon. all three mirna were determined to be dynamically regulated with more than a three-fold increase in telencephalon expression between e <dig> and e <dig>  these neuronally important mirnas have critical roles in neurodevelopment and are associated with neuropathology . concordantly, their predicted gene targets were also highly significant in our study. validation of microarray expression for these three mirna using quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr   confirmed significantly lower expression in the telencephalon compared to the mesencephalon at e <dig>  to further investigate their biological relevance, ipa software was used to identify putative differentially expressed target genes of these dynamically regulated mirna. analysis of this gene dataset using the david online database revealed significant  over-representation of neurodevelopmental functions in the mammalian forebrain cortex, including axonogenesis; neuron projection development; synaptic transmission; forebrain development; regionalization; and learning and behaviour .figure  <dig>

target gene silencing in vitro
our expression analysis of mirna and their cognate mrna targets suggested that there are a tremendous number of interactions that underlie the spatiotemporal segmentation in mammalian brain development. however, to further support the functional association between neural development-associated target genes and altered expression in this group of mirnas, the respective mirna recognition elements  from a selection of six functionally significant target genes, clasp <dig>  rab <dig>  cbll <dig>  wnt7a, gpr <dig> and plxnb <dig>  were cloned into the 3’ untranslated region  of a luciferase reporter gene construct and co-transfected into a recipient cell line with synthetic mirna mimics corresponding to those altered in vivo. the degree of reporter gene activity and the impact of mirnas were then ascertained by measuring the relative luciferase activity . mirnas interact with their respective mres in the 3’utr of transcripts and each gene may contain binding sites for multiple mirna. therefore observing mirna-mediated effects using a reporter gene construct allows subtle changes in gene expression to be observed. most of the reporter constructs behaved in accordance with expectation and were repressed 8-25%  in the presence of synthetic mirna in comparison to a scrambled-duplex co-transfected control. these data indicate that transfected mirnas bound to their target mres and repressed the expression of luciferase, with the most responsive targets derived from the 3’-utr of wnt7a and gpr <dig>  these were both targeted by mir- <dig>  which appeared to have the greatest overall effect, whereas mir- <dig> had the least effect on these target gene constructs. the only exception was the plxnb <dig> construct, which displayed increased expression in the presence of synthetic mir- <dig>  collectively, these reporter assays supported the existence of relationships between genes reported to be associated with neural development and developmentally regulated mirnas.figure  <dig>

discussion
mirna and post-transcriptional regulation of neurodevelopment
the trajectory of human brain development closely mirrors that seen in the rodent
 <cit>  and as such the rat offers an excellent model to investigate the coordination and timing of mirna expression across fetal development. in the current study we examined the expression profiles of mirna within the mesencephalon and telencephalon from e <dig> until birth. we hypothesized that the developing telencephalon would exhibit a significantly different temporal mirna profile in relation to the mesencephalon and this was supported by the observation that 87% of expressed mirna underwent significant change across development, with clear differences in patterning between the two regions. the highest level of change in mirna expression occurred early in development  and plateaued thereafter, with differences between the telencephalon and mesencephalon decreasing noticeably during that time period. in accordance with our hypothesis, telencephalon mirna expression was significantly lower than the mesencephalon at e <dig> and consistent with the delayed development of this region. we also observed  <dig> mirna with predicted function in neurodevelopmental processes, exclusively expressed in the telencephalon during early brain development .

we then employed a bioinformatics approach to further understand the differential developmental trajectories of these two brain regions. temporally regulated mirnas and genes were examined using a combination of mirna and gene expression profiling and computational target prediction. hierarchical clustering of mirna during telencephalon development revealed two distinct clusters of mirna. these clusters had significantly higher expression in the mesencephalon at e <dig> whilst expression in the telencephalon remained significantly lower . the mirna contained in these clusters are predicted to target temporally-regulated genes involved in brain signalling pathways important for neurodevelopment and neuronal functioning including: dopamine receptor signalling; gaba receptor signalling; glutamate receptor signalling and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. as expression of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions pathway is demonstrated to correlate with synaptic maturity
 <cit> , this data is consistent both with the telencephalon being less differentiated at this time point and more importantly implicates a critical role for mirna in this process. this also indicates that at such an early timepoint, the developing telencephalon may be largely unaffected by environmental insults compared to the mesencephalon. this may be particularly relevant for certain developmental animal models of disease. for instance the widely used maternal immune activation model of schizophrenia employs the artificial viral construct poly i:c which induces a strictly time-limited inflammatory response of approximately two days in the maternal animal
 <cit> . this may be why when it is commonly administered at e <dig> in mice , the downstream effects may be restricted to the developing mesencephalon rather than later maturing regions such as the telencephalon
 <cit> .

mirna-mrna interactions
while there are some exceptions, mirna function is usually associated with repression of target gene expression, such that when a mirna is expressed at high levels, its target mrna is reduced
. indeed, several reports have identified inverse expression patterns between differentially expressed mirna and differentially expressed mrna during development
 <cit> . in this study we found the putative down-regulated gene targets of up-regulated mirna in the telencephalon between e <dig> and e <dig> are predicted to be involved in many important brain signalling pathways including axon guidance, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signalling and long-term depression.

altered expression of mirs- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> was particularly noteworthy, as these three neuronally important mirnas were much more abundant in developing mesencephalon than telencephalon at the earliest embryonic age showing more than a three-fold increase in telencephalon expression between e <dig> and e <dig>  all three mirna have critical roles in neurodevelopment and are associated with neurological disorders such as alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. we confirmed a functional link between these three mirna and suppression of expressed target genes by cloning the mres from clasp <dig>  rab <dig>  cbll <dig>  wnt7a, gpr <dig> and plxnb <dig> downstream of a luciferase reporter gene. these reporter constructs were then co-transfected with synthetic analogues of their cognate mirna into a recipient cell line, such that the extent of reporter gene expression and therefore the influence of mirna could be ascertained through the measurement of relative luciferase activity . most of these constructs were significantly repressed in the presence of synthetic mirna. in particular, regulation of 3’-utr elements from wnt7a  and gpr <dig>  was particularly strong and, along with clasp <dig>  and rab <dig>  provides support for the role of post-transcriptional regulation in axon and dendritic growth, maturation and function
. pathway analysis of these target genes indicated that these mirna may exert significant influence during neurodevelopment through the regulation of pathways including: axon guidance; neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction; wnt; erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog ; and map kinase signalling.

in the telencephalon, expression levels of mir- <dig> increased over four-fold between e <dig> and e <dig>  a similar finding to that of sempere and colleagues
 <cit> , who found mir- <dig> expression levels progressively accumulated upon neuronal differentiation in both mouse and human embryonic carcinoma cells. experiments by thomson and colleagues
 <cit>  similarly found levels of mir- <dig> were significantly increased in mice at e <dig>  compared to levels in embryonic stem cells. mir- <dig> is a member of the let- <dig> family, highly conserved across species in sequence and function and involved in the developmental timing of cell fates . in support of a role for mir- <dig> in telencephalon development, mir- <dig> overexpression was found to significantly decrease the activity of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the cytoplasmic linker associated protein  <dig>  3’-utr. clasp <dig> plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation during mitosis
 <cit>  and is a key regulator of neuronal morphogenesis, neuronal polarity and synapse formation and activity
 <cit> .

similarly, the results suggest a role for mir- <dig> in brain development with expression levels increased more than four-fold in the telencephalon between e <dig> and birth. mir- <dig> arises from the mir-212/ <dig> cluster, which is highly conserved in vertebrates. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are tandem mirnas with similar target specificity due to their identical seed sequences. in the brain, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> play vital roles in the formation and plasticity of neuronal connections, and long-term synapse activation . dysregulation of mir- <dig> is associated with drug addiction
 <cit> , neuropathological disorders
 <cit>  and schizophrenia
 <cit> . our luciferase reporter assays support mir- <dig> involvement in neurodevelopment via regulation of rab <dig>  member ras oncogene family  and cbl proto-oncogene-like  <dig>  e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase . rab <dig> belongs to the rab family of low molecular weight  gtp-binding proteins, crucial in ensuring the spatiotemporal regulation of membrane traffic
 <cit> . rab <dig> is enriched in neural tissue and plays a role in regulating neurotransmitter release
 <cit> . cbll <dig> is a ring finger type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and an important regulator of cell proliferation
 <cit> . in drosophila, cbll <dig> is required for proper function of cell surface proteins and for endoderm and mesoderm morphogenesis
 <cit> . consistent with the increase of mir- <dig> expression between e <dig> and e <dig>  cbll <dig> function is demonstrated to be most vital in the early stages of embryogenesis, with its contribution declining in later stages
 <cit> .

another developmentally regulated mirna is mir- <dig>  with expression levels increasing more than four-fold in the telencephalon between e <dig> and e <dig>  mir- <dig> is enriched in neurons and involved in neuronal maturation, regulation of dendritic development and phenotypic maturation of new neurons
 <cit> . recent studies demonstrate increasing expression of mir- <dig> during neuronal differentiation, leading to reduced neural stem cell proliferation, accelerated neural differentiation and decreased dendritic development
 <cit> . dysregulation of mir- <dig> has been associated with intellectual disability and alzheimer’s disease
 <cit>  and the mir <dig> gene has also recently found to be highly associated with schizophrenia in a genome wide screen and associated with cognitive function in patients with the disorder
 <cit> . this study confirmed the potency of mir- <dig> to down-regulate g-protein coupled receptor  <dig>  and wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 7a  using a reporter gene strategy. gpr <dig> is a brain-enriched g protein–coupled receptor with a role in modulating the striatal dopaminergic system
 <cit>  and in regulating medium spiny neuron excitability
 <cit> . wnt7a signalling is critical to regulate dendritic spine growth and synaptic strength
 <cit> , mediating synapse density and numbers, and hippocampal network structure
 <cit> . during development wnt signalling is required for cell proliferation and differentiation, cell polarity generation and embryonic patterning.

as various brain regions develop at different times there is likely to be differing windows of vulnerability to environmental insults. appropriate spatiotemporal expression of mirna is vital during brain development and dysregulation during sensitive stages is likely to have a profound impact on the coordinated expression of developmentally significant genes associated with the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. this is supported by the alterations of mirna expression observed in the neuropathology of alzheimer’s disease
 <cit> , huntington’s disease
 <cit> , parkinson’s disease
 and schizophrenia
 <cit> . understanding the role of mirna in brain ontogeny could identify critical windows of developmental significance that are susceptible to environmental insults which contribute to the development of neurobehavioural or neuropsychiatric syndromes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first global characterization of both mirna and mrna expression between the telencephalon and mesencephalon at various stages during development in rodent brain. comparing the telencephalon and mesencephalon affords a molecular basis for understanding the nature and timing of regional differentiation. although these results may have been hypothesised based on current evidence suggesting that the mesencephalon develops earlier than the telencephalon, the present data now provide direct molecular support that differential regional and temporal mirna expression within the brain is part of this process. knowledge of the temporal and spatial expression profiles of mirna and their target genes is an important initial step in elucidating their functions. together these results show that mirna expression is frequently region- and time-specific with an important influence in functionally relevant pathways in the developing brain.
