BACKGROUND
the neisseria genus, of gram-negative betaproteobacteria, contains two closely related human pathogens, n. meningitidis, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia and n. gonorrhoeae, that causes the sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhoea  <cit> . survival of bacteria like neisseria depends upon an effective response to oxidative challenges from the host environment, for example, reactive oxygen species , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide  produced by phagocytes. to protect cellular components, including proteins and dna, bacteria produce a range of enzymes, including catalases, peroxidases, oxidoreductases, and superoxide dismutases, whose expression is frequently controlled by redox-sensing transcription factors.

oxyr, widely known as a mediator of hydrogen peroxide-induced gene expression, is a redox-sensitive lysr-type transcription factor. increased cellular hydrogen peroxide levels result in the oxidation of a pair of conserved cysteine residues present in the regulatory domain of oxyr  <cit>  which leads in turn to the activation of transcription. in e. coli, oxyr regulates in excess of ten genes, including the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying enzyme catalase , glutathione reductase , glutaredoxin  <dig>  and thioredoxin  <dig>   <cit> . the neisserial oxyr which shares 37% amino acid sequence identity with its e. coli orthologue appears to control expression of a smaller regulon comprising the genes encoding catalase , glutathione oxidoreductase  and peroxiredoxin oxidoreductase   <cit> . the oxyr regulon appears to have an important role in pathogenesis since n. gonorrhoeae strains lacking either oxyr, prx or gor are deficient in both biofilm formation and show reduced survival in cervical epithelial models  <cit> . in fact, there are now several reports of oxyr being important for biofilm formation in other bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa and tannerella forsythia  <cit> .

crystal structures of the regulatory domains of wild type and a c199s mutant of e. coli oxyr have been reported. these structures, corresponding to oxidised and 'pseudo' reduced forms respectively, indicated that oxidation of oxyr leads to a local rearrangement of the c-terminal regulatory domain of the protein and formation of an intramolecular disulphide bridge between c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> . kim et al.  <cit>  raised the possibility that the thiol group of the cysteine residues of oxyr may form other stable adducts in vivo including s-no and s-sg, through s-nitrosylation and s-glutathionylation respectively  <cit> . in contrast, lee et al.  <cit>  detected no such adducts and their experiments indicated that activation of oxyr via formation of an intramolecular disulphide follows a two-step mechanism. initially, c <dig> is oxidised to a sulphenic acid that is relatively unstable and rapidly reacts with c <dig> to form an intramolecular bond  <cit> .

biochemical analyses have indicated that e. coli oxyr is tetrameric fitting the archetype for lysr regulators  <cit>  and is believed to interact with dna as a dimer of dimers whose spacing/orientation are dependent upon the oxidation state of the protein  <cit> . modelling of reduced and oxidised oxyr dimers indicates that the spacing of dna binding domains in each dimer is unlikely to be altered by oxidation. this suggests that oxidation modulates dna binding by modulating the dimer-dimer interaction  <cit> .

in n. meningitidis, oxyr appears to both repress basal catalase activity and control enzyme induction in response to hydrogen peroxide. thus, oxyr knock-out cells showed higher basal catalase levels than wild type cells and appeared less sensitive to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the single c199s n. meningitidis oxyr mutant strain behaved like the null mutant in both killing assays and primer extension analysis, in that it had neither the ability to repress or activate transcription of catalase. however, the c208a oxyr mutant strain showed an 'intermediate' phenotype; in killing assays, it was similar to wild type cells, suggesting that catalase production was repressed but in contrast to wild type cells, it was impaired in its response to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the physiological relevance of this is unclear, though it may indicate a functional role for a partially reduced form of the protein as proposed by ieva et al  <cit> .

as part of an investigation of the relationship between oxyr structure and its function in n. meningitidis, we have determined the crystal structure of the regulatory domain of the protein, in its authentically reduced form. the overall fold of the reduced neisserial oxyr shows a high degree of similarity to the structure of the c199s mutant oxyr  from e. coli, which cannot form the redox sensitive disulphide.

by comparing the structure with those of the regulatory domains in three full length lysr structures, we have obtained some insight into how oxidation of the redox responsive disulphide may affect the quaternary structure of oxyr tetramers.

RESULTS
oxyr protein production and oxidation state analysis of the cysteine residues
selenomethionine labelled protein, corresponding to the regulatory domain of oxyr , was produced in e. coli for crystallization . crystal screening experiments were set up in both the presence and absence of the reducing agent tris  phosphine  . crystals only grew from the protein containing tcep. following this observation, we compared the oxidation state of the cysteine residues  in oxyr either treated with tcep or untreated. the mass of the two protein samples was measured before and after addition of the alkylating agent, iodoacetamide . prior to alkylation, the mass spectra of the untreated rd-oxyr shown in panel  contained two predominant peaks, with the main peak  fitting with the predicted mass  for selenomethionine labelled protein. the small, additional peak observed at m/z  <dig>   corresponds to a sodium adduct of rd-oxyr. no peaks consistent with any other cysteine adducts were observed. after alkylation , the main peak occurred at m/z  <dig>  an increase of  <dig> da compared to the control sample consistent with the addition of one acetamide group  to one of the cysteine residues. a secondary peak was observed at m/z  <dig>  corresponding to the alkylation of all three cysteine residues. the alkylation of cysteine residues is dependent on the oxidation state, and accessibility, of the reactive thiol group. when the rd-oxyr was pre-treated with tcep prior to alkylation two additional peaks were observed . the peak at m/z  <dig> corresponded to alkylation of  <dig> cysteine residues and the peak at m/z  <dig> corresponded to unmodified rd-oxyr. the presence of these two peaks suggests that the alkylation reaction had not gone to completion in this sample.

a the data are essentially complete to  <dig>  Å resolution.

b rwork and rfree are defined by r = Σhkl||fobs|-|fcalc||/Σhkl|fobs|, where h,k,l are the indices of the reflections , fobs and fcalc are the structure factors, deduced from measured intensities and calculated from the model, respectively.

overall, the results showed that the rd-oxyr protein produced in e. coli contained a mixed population of proteins with cysteine residues in both reduced and oxidised forms. although the specific proportions of each species cannot be determined from the mass spectra obtained, due to potential differences in the ionization properties of the different redox forms, the results indicate that the oxyr protein was predominantly in the oxidised state with only one cysteine available for alkylation in the absence of reduction. given that c <dig> is located at the c-terminus of the protein on the opposite face of the protein to c <dig> and c <dig> , it seems most likely that this is the un-paired cysteine. it follows that c <dig> and c <dig> are disulphide-linked in a significant proportion of the recombinant rd-oxyr, supporting the results for "air oxidised" e. coli oxyr, reported by lee et al.  <cit>  which contradicted earlier data of kim et al.  <cit>  who found no evidence of a c199-c <dig> disulphide.

description of the oxyr structure
the n. meningitidis rd-oxyr structure was determined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method using a selenomethionine-substituted protein. as expected from the requirement for tcep during crystallization, the protein was in the reduced form with no disulphide between c <dig> and c <dig>  we observed no evidence for partial reduction of c <dig> in the electron density . the asymmetric unit contained a dimer arranged in the classical head-to-tail orientation, typical for regulatory domain structures of lysr transcription factors  which was first observed in the structure of the regulatory domain of e. coli cysb  <cit> .

each oxyr chain comprises two sub-domains, rd-i  and rd-ii  which contains the redox centre . there are three residues missing from both the n- and c-termini in the final model of the first monomer, . rd-i, which is more structurally conserved within the lysr family compared to rd-ii, contains secondary structural elements of topology β1-α1-β2-α3-β3-t-β <dig> from the n-termini and β9-t-α6-β <dig> from the c-termini. the β <dig> and β <dig> strands cross-over between the two sub-domains. rd-ii contains a central core of  <dig> β strands  surrounded by a series of  <dig>  and α helices  . the two redox sensitive cysteines  are separated by  <dig>  Å and are located either end of helix α <dig> . residues a212-q <dig> form a second helix  which extends out of rd-ii, at an angle of ~75° relative to α <dig> . chain b is missing  <dig> residues in total  largely from rd-ii. disorder within this region of the regulatory domain was observed in both chains of the structure of the e. coli c199s oxyr mutant  <cit> .

comparison of the e. coli and n. meningitidis oxyr regulatory domain structures
the structure of reduced n. meningitidis oxyr  was compared to that of the c199s oxyr mutant from e. coli  which represents a 'pseudo reduced' form of the protein. overall, the two structures proved to be very similar, superimposing with a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> equivalent cα atoms. in the overlay shown in figure 4a, residue s <dig> of the 'pseudo reduced' e. coli structure and the corresponding c <dig> residue of neisserial oxyr are in almost exactly the same position. the side-chains of both residues are directed towards the interior of the protein, though c <dig> is more exposed to solvent, with a calculated accessible surface area  of  <dig> Å <dig> compared to  <dig> Å <dig> for s <dig>  choi et al propose that in the reduced state, c <dig> in e. coli oxyr is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions involving l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> and proximity to r <dig> which could form a charge interaction with an ionised c <dig>  <cit> . the corresponding residues  are structurally conserved within neisserial oxyr, indicating that they are likely to have the same stabilising affect in this protein. by contrast, the side-chains of c <dig> are pointing in different directions in the two structures, with c <dig> buried in neisserial oxyr with an asa of  <dig> Å <dig> compared to  <dig> Å <dig> for the surface exposed c <dig> in e. coli oxyr. reactivity of c <dig> with peroxide is believed to initiate the redox switch in oxyr with oxidation to a sulphenic acid  <cit> . formation of the disulphide with c <dig> requires significant local rearrangement of the polypeptide chain. in the structure of oxidised e. coli oxyr , the helix equivalent to the α <dig> helix in the neisserial structure  is unwound adopting a random coil type arrangement. presumably, a similar conformational change would occur on oxidation of the n. meningitidis oxyr. interestingly, residues that follow on from α <dig> helix in the reduced n. meningitidis oxyr structure  form an alpha helix , whereas the equivalent residues in the e. coli c199s structure are disordered . in the n. meningitidis oxyr sequence there is an insertion following the α <dig> helix which is absent from the e. coli sequence and may account for the structural differences in this region . in the structure of oxidised e. coli oxyr, residues corresponding to helix α <dig> in the neisserial structure adopt a different secondary structure namely a short beta strand  . whether helix α <dig> in neisserial oxyr would be preserved following formation of the c199-c <dig> disulphide is uncertain, though examination of the reduced n. meningitidis oxyr structure suggests that helix α <dig> could be re-positioned without loss of secondary structure.

modelling the full length oxyr
biophysical characterization of full-length e. coli oxyr indicates that it is tetrameric in solution  <cit> . furthermore, a c199s mutant that models the reduced state of the protein also behaves predominantly as a tetramer according to size exclusion chromatography  <cit> . thus, oxyr appears to be typical of lysr family regulators which are generally observed to form tetramers . an exception to this is the crga regulator, also from n. meningitidis, which we have previously shown to be octameric in solution and in the crystal structure  <cit> . cluster analysis of all known lysr sequences has shown that crga belongs to a sub-group that is distinct from the majority of lysr including oxyr  <cit> .

to visualise how the reduced form of neisserial rd-oxyr might be arranged in the full length protein, we superimposed the structure onto that of three lysr tetramers whose crystal structures have been determined. these were cbnr from ralstonia eutropha nh <dig> which regulates catechol metabolism  and two putative lysr transcription factors from pseudomonas aeruginosa . although each tetramer consists of a dimer of dimers, the arrangement of the dimers in each tetrameric assembly is significantly different. this in turn determines the relative positions of the n-terminal dna binding domains. the oxyr regulatory domain superimposed well on each structure, with a rmsd of ~ <dig>  Å for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  equivalent cα atoms  and corresponding sequence identities of  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  respectively from a visual inspection of the overlayed structures, it is possible to see how formation of the c199- <dig> on oxidation of oxyr could affect the quaternary arrangement of the protein. as described below, the situation is different for each form of tetrameric assembly represented by the three structures. in the cbnr structure, each dimer, formed between chains a & q, or b & p, contains one monomer in a compact form  and one in an extended conformation . the only contact between the regulatory domains of the two dimers is found in the core of the tetramer, at the interface formed primarily between the c-terminal α helices of the two rd-ii sub-domains of chains a & p . the overlay with reduced oxyr shows that the helices, α <dig> and α <dig> which are located either side of c <dig> would contribute to the dimer-dimer interface in this model of oxyr . therefore, the formation of the c199-c <dig> disulphide bridge which involves a disruption of the α <dig> helix  would be expected to alter the dimer-dimer interface and hence the quaternary structure of the oxyr tetramer. in the pa <dig> tetramer, the regulatory domains also contribute to the dimer-dimer interface, but in this case the domains of all four subunits are involved . in a "head-to-tail" arrangement of the regulatory domains of the two dimers, the α <dig> and α <dig> helices of the overlayed reduced oxyr still form part of the dimer-dimer interface  packing onto residues h153-i <dig>  in rdi of the adjacent dimer. again, formation of the disulphide would be anticipated to alter the dimer-dimer packing. the pa <dig> presents a very different tetrameric arrangement compared to the other two lysr structures in that there is no contact between the regulatory domains of the two dimers  rather the dimer-dimer interfaces are formed by the dna binding domains and interdomain linker helices. in this case, superimposition of the reduced oxyr regulatory domain indicates that the α <dig> and α <dig> helices contribute to the interface between adjacent subunit monomers packing onto the second helix of the dna binding domain .

in the absence of a full length oxyr structure we do not know which  of the three structures we have considered provides the best model of the oxyr tetramer. it may well be that oxyr can adopt all the configurations represented by the three structures. however in two of the three possible models  the redox sensitive disulphide is located at a dimer-dimer interface. this provides a plausible explanation of how formation of the disulphide in response to oxidative challenge, may modulate the arrangement of subunits in the tetrameric assembly. this in turn would affect the relative positions of the dna binding domains and hence account for the changes in the interaction with target promoters that has been observed experimentally. the oxidation of c199-c <dig> would have a more direct effect on the position or orientation of the dna binding domains if oxyr adopted the tetrameric configuration of pa <dig> .

discussion
as reviewed by paget and buttner in  <dig>  <cit>  two different mechanisms for oxyr regulation have been proposed by the stamler and storz research groups respectively. the storz group suggest that oxyr functions as an on-off switch, converting between oxidised, with an intramolecular disulphide, and reduced forms; whereas the stamler group, who detected no disulphide bond, suggest that oxyr has a graded response with c <dig> being subject to different modifications  producing different transcriptional outcomes  <cit> . consistent with the results of storz et al., our mass spectrometry data indicated that the nessierial oxyr contains a disulphide presumably the result of air oxidation during purification; no cysteine adducts were detected. this favours an activation mechanism based on the reversible oxidation of the conserved cysteine pair . molecular modelling with the reduced and oxidised oxyr structures indicated that formation of such an intramolecular disulphide bond would affect the dimer-dimer interface of the neisserial oxyr tetramer. a small movement at this pivot point, in the centre of the tetramer, could potentially translate into a much larger movement of the heads of the dna binding domains . an indication that oxidation of oxyr is associated with a change in dna binding comes from studies of e. coli oxyr. wild type and c199s oxyr mutant were compared in gel shift and foot printing experiments and shown to differ in their dna binding properties  <cit> . in the case of its own promoter, the results showed that the oxidised form of the protein contacted the oxyr promoter at four consecutive major grooves consistent with a tetrameric assembly. by contrast the c199s mutant protected a more extended region containing two binding sites, each comprising two major grooves separated by one helical turn. this indicates that the oxidised form of e. coli oxyr adopts a more compact structure, with the dna binding pairs closer together, compared to the reduced form  <cit> . although the n. meningiditis oxyr structure provides some clues as to how oxidation of oxyr could alter its interaction with dna, it does not readily explain the phenotypic differences between the single c199s and c208a mutant neisserial strains reported by ieva et al.  <cit> . the c199s mutant does not appear to be functionally active  whereas the c208a is able to repress but not activate catalase expression. formation of the c199-c <dig> disulphide bond is presumably required for activation of the kat promoter since this is blocked by mutation of either cysteine residue. however, repression of the kat promoter only requires c <dig> since the c208a mutant retains repressive activity whereas the c199s is inactive. to ascertain whether this reflects conformational differences between the two proteins will require further structural studies and comparison with the authentically reduced protein reported here. intriguingly, an oxyr homologue from deinococcus radiodurans has recently been reported that contains only one of the conserved cysteines , corresponding to the c <dig> of e. coli and n. meningitidis oxyr   <cit> . deinococcus strains in which the oxyr gene had been either deleted or substituted with a c210a mutant gene, showed increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide challenge and no increase in catalase activity compared to wild type bacteria. c <dig> residue was also shown to be oxidised to a sulphenic acid in vitro under conditions of oxidative stress  <cit> . it would be very interesting to compare the structure of the deinococcus oxyr with those of n. meningitidis and e. coli in order to understand better the role of the individual cysteines in the functional responses of these proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the regulatory domain of n. meningitidis oxyr represents the first determined for a wildtype oxyr protein in its reduced form. although there are subtle differences, overall, the structures of neisserial and e. coli oxyr are very similar and hence the mechanism of activation of these regulators is likely to be similar in both species. modelling of an n. meningitidis oxyr tetramer suggested that the redox active cysteines, c <dig> and c <dig>  are located at the interface of the two dimers that form the lysr tetramer. this location suggests that formation of the c199-c <dig> disulphide would affect the relative disposition of the two dimers within the tetramer which in turn may alter the spacing/orientation of the dna binding domains and hence the interaction of oxyr with its dna binding sites.
