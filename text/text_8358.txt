BACKGROUND
the development of human diseases is often accompanied by changes in the gene expression landscape. regulated mainly at the transcription level, gene expression is tightly controlled by transcription factors  that bind not only promoters proximal to transcription start sites , but also distal cis-regulatory elements  that are far removed from tss  <cit> . genome-wide profiling studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing  have identified thousands of functional/active enhancers that are either bound by the transcriptional co-activator p <dig>  or characterized by their association with high levels of h <dig> k <dig> acetylation  . these enhancers often carry binding sites for more than one tf, which interact with the basal transcription machinery associated with core promoters to regulate gene transcription  <cit> . very often, tfs also recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes to convert the chromatin to a state permissive for transcription. pioneer transcription factors , for example, are often the first to engage in a regulatory chromatin region upon stimulation, and enhance transcription by remodeling the local chromatin to make it competent for other tfs to bind  <cit> . while global profiling of genomic sites competent for tf binding is imperative for the understanding of tf functions, such work has also become increasingly important for defining disease etiologies, as mutations in cis-regulatory elements are frequently found to be associated with human diseases  by whole-genome sequencing studies  <cit> .

activating transcription factor  <dig>  is a member of the atf/creb family of transcription factors involving in many important human diseases including cancer , atherosclerosis  <cit> , infections  <cit> , cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> , and hypospadias  <cit> . the contributions of atf <dig> to these diseases are often owing to its rapid induction by a wide-range of cellular stresses  stress), leading to activation of cellular signaling required for the maintenance of cell homeostasis. indeed, while it binds and activates the tumor suppressor p <dig> in response to oncogenic challenges   <cit> , atf <dig> also engages in the immune response by interacting with nf-κb and repressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the toll-like receptor  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, atf <dig> induced by reactive oxygen species causes high susceptibility to secondary infections by repressing interleukin  <dig>  expression during sepsis-associated immunosuppression  <cit> . like other atf/creb transcription factors, atf <dig> regulates transcription by binding the canonical atf/cre cis-regulatory element  or the similar ap- <dig> site tca-3’) via its basic region-leucine zipper domain   <cit> . although an over-simplified model suggests that atf <dig> homodimers and heterodimers  repress and induce gene expression, respectively  <cit> , the mechanism by which atf <dig> regulates transcription remains largely unknown. interestingly, although the structures of the bzip domains are highly similar allowing the largely diversified atf/creb proteins to bind the same cis-regulatory elements, the genes regulated by atf <dig> are distinct from those controlled by its family members. atf <dig> and atf <dig>  for instance, regulate expression of proapoptotic genes and genes involved in protein folding and er quality control upon er stress, respectively  <cit> . as recent evidence supports that atf <dig> engages in a complex protein-protein interaction network involving many tfs and transcription co-regulators  <cit> , it is likely that the interactions with other nuclear proteins define the genomic sites where atf <dig> binds and the transcription programs that atf <dig> regulates. characterization of genome-wide atf <dig> binding sites would thus lead to further elucidation of the atf <dig> interaction network and a better understanding of how atf <dig> regulates expression of disease-associated genes.

in this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of atf <dig> binding profiles in the human genome. we show that atf <dig> bound a large portion of active enhancers characterized by p <dig> binding and enriched with k <dig> acetylated histone h <dig>  under the basal condition where atf <dig> was expressed at a very low level. while the expression of genes proximal to these enhancers tended to be regulated by atf <dig>  atf <dig> was co-localized with p <dig> and regulated p53-target gene expression in response to dna damage. our results thus suggest that atf <dig> likely bookmarks genes for transcriptional regulation under basal and stressed conditions.

RESULTS
genome-wide mapping of atf <dig> binding sites using isogenic cell lines
to profile global atf3-binding sites, we first employed a genome-editing approach based on recombinant adenoassociated viruses  to generate a cell line in which atf <dig> expression was knocked out. towards this end, we constructed an aav targeting vector containing left  and right homology arms  flanking the exon  <dig> of the atf <dig> gene, and introduced the vector into hct <dig> human colon cancer cells via raav infections  <cit> . homologous recombination between the homology arms and the atf <dig> fragments resulted in the insertion of a selection gene  into an atf <dig> allele. a small deletion  in the exon  <dig> was subsequently generated by cre-mediated excision of the selection gene . the same strategy was employed to target the second atf <dig> allele, generating a cell line  in which atf <dig> expression was disrupted. we confirmed that atf <dig> was not expressed and atf <dig> expression was not induced by camptothecin  - a dna-damaging agent - in the knockout cells .fig.  <dig> atf <dig> binding profiling using isogenic hct <dig> cells. a raav-mediated genome editing was applied to generate atf3-knocked out hct <dig> cells. raav-mediated homologous recombination led to insertion of the aav targeting vector into atf <dig> exon  <dig>  a deletion of 22 bp was generated in one atf <dig> allele after cre-mediated excision of the neo selection gene. la and ra, left and right homology arms; itr, inverted terminal repeat; ko, knockout. b atf <dig> expression was completely abolished in atf3-ko cells. indicated cells were treated with  <dig>  μm of cpt and subjected to western blotting. c venn diagram showing atf3-binding peaks in atf <dig> wild-type  and knockout  cells. d heatmap and intensity plots showing atf <dig> peaks in atf <dig> wt and ko cells. e representative genome browser views of atf <dig> peaks. atf <dig> peaks near atf <dig>  stk <dig>  hyi, spry <dig>  and utp <dig> were shown for both atf3-wt and ko cells. f, g chip-qpcr was used to validate atf <dig> binding to representative genome sites that were referred to as the names of their annotated genes. nr, no-binding control region. error bars represent sd for three replicate measurements. h the binding intensity determined by independent chip-qpcr assays was correlated with chip-seq scores of peaks tested in  and 



we thus subjected the wild-type  cells and the knockout cells to chromatin immunoprecipitation using an atf <dig> antibody. precipitated dnas were then labeled and subjected to next-generation sequencing and sequencing reads were mapped to human genome and analyzed for enrichment. although atf <dig> was expressed at a low level , we identified  <dig>  high-confident atf3-binding peaks in the sample derived from atf3-wt cells . out of them, a majority of peaks  were atf <dig> specific, as they were not found in the atf3-ko cells . a few examples of atf <dig> peaks were shown in fig. 1e. of note, like a majority of identified sites, these atf <dig> peaks were found only in the atf3-wt sample but not in the atf3-ko sample . consistent with an early result that atf <dig> represses its own expression  <cit> , we found that atf <dig> strongly bound its own promoter . using quantitative pcr  to examine samples from an independent chip experiment, we confirmed that atf <dig> bound to all of the tested genomic sites identified by chip-seq . again, atf <dig> bound to its own promoter in the atf3-wt cells but not in the knockout cells . the strengths of atf <dig> binding to these sites measured by chip-qpcr were well correlated with the chip-seq scores , demonstrating high reproducibility and reliability of our chip-seq data.

global atf3-binding profile and motif analysis
the  <dig>  atf3-specific peaks were annotated to  <dig>  unique genes. we analyzed the distribution of these binding sites relative to tss in the human genome. consistent with the atf3’s role as a transcription factor, about one fifth  of the atf <dig> peaks were localized in promoters, which was defined as regions that were ±2 kb surrounding tss . given that only a small portion of dna in the whole genome can be defined as promoters, these results indicate that atf <dig> were enriched in promoters. however, atf <dig> also bound genomic regions far removed from tss , suggesting that atf <dig> also likely regulates transcription via long-range interactions. gene ontology  analysis of the top  <dig> annotated genes with high binding scores revealed that atf <dig> preferably bound to regulatory elements for genes involving in biological processes such as cellular response to stress, cell cycle arrest and intracellular signaling cascade, as well as pathways such as p <dig> signaling pathway . interestingly, “cellular response to stress” and “p <dig> signaling pathway” turned out to be the top go terms for the atf3-bound genes, consistent with the well-established roles that atf <dig> plays in regulating cellular stress responses and the p <dig> pathway  <cit> .fig.  <dig> global atf3-binding profile under the basal condition. a a pie chart showing distribution of atf <dig> binding sites relative to annotated genes. b  <dig> annotated genes with top peak scores were used for david go analysis. go biological process  terms and kegg pathway terms are shown. c top motifs identified in the atf <dig> binding sites. d schematic showing relative abundance and overlaps of the three known atf <dig> binding motifs. the numbers are peak numbers. e the binding of atf <dig> to the atf/cre motif appeared to be stronger than the ap- <dig> motif. student t-test. f a table showing top motifs after combining motifs with same/similar sequences. g venn diagram showing overlaps of ctcf, gata <dig>  and tead motifs with the atf <dig> motif



we also searched the atf <dig> binding sites for known tf binding motifs using the homer de novo motif discovery software. a total of  <dig> motifs were identified with a p value smaller than  <dig> . with only one exception , the top  <dig> identified motifs contained either the canonical atf/cre sequence  or the ap- <dig> sequence  . as c/ebp harbors a bzip domain that can mediate dimerization with other bzip proteins including atf <dig>  <cit> , it might be that atf <dig> bound the cebp:ap <dig> motif through dimerization with c/ebp. overall,  <dig>  % of atf <dig> binding sites contain an element predicted to be bound by atf <dig> - collectively referred to as the atf <dig> motif hereafter  - suggesting that atf <dig> directly binds genomic dna in most cases. interestingly, although more atf <dig> peaks contained the ap- <dig> motif , the binding affinity of atf <dig> to the canonical atf/cre element appeared to be higher than that for atf <dig> binding to the ap- <dig> element . in addition to these known atf <dig> binding motifs, other top atf <dig> binding motifs  include gata <dig>  ctcf, tead, and sp <dig>  which was presented in  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of atf <dig> peaks, respectively . although these atf3-binding peaks often contain a known atf <dig> motif , atf <dig> might also bind these motifs through interacting with corresponding tfs. indeed, atf <dig> has been shown to interact with sp <dig>  <cit> .

atf <dig> globally binds active enhancers enriched with p <dig> and h3k27ac
as atf <dig> bound genomic sites far removed from tss, we sought to determine whether these sites are coincided with active enhancers that are often marked by p <dig> binding and flanked with high levels of h3k27ac . towards this end, we acquired p <dig>  h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me3a chip-seq data  from the gene expression omnibus  database gse <dig> and gse <dig>  <cit> . we first examined the atf <dig> peaks in the genome browser, and found that atf <dig> bound to many sites that were also bound by p <dig> and flanked by regions with high levels of h3k27ac , suggesting that atf <dig> bound to active enhancers. indeed, unbiased statistics analysis revealed that up to  <dig>  % of atf <dig> peaks were overlapped with p <dig> peaks, and 37 % of p <dig> peaks were bound by atf <dig> . intensity plots also show that p <dig> was globally co-localized with atf <dig> and that the h3k27ac histone marker surrounded the atf3/p <dig> peaks as expected . we segregated the atf <dig> peaks into proximal sites  and distal sites  based on their distances to tss, representing h3k4me3-enriched promoters and h3k4me1-enriched enhancers, respectively . the intensity plots revealed that it was the distal sites, but not the proximal sites, that were coincided with p <dig> binding events . using qpcr, we validated that p <dig> bound to all of the tested atf <dig> binding sites in an independent chip experiment . similarly, the enrichment of h3k27ac in these atf <dig> sites was also validated . of note, as p <dig> is not the only enzyme that can acetylate h <dig> at the k <dig> site, the h3k27ac level was not strictly correlated with the p <dig> level in some genome sites. taken together, our results have revealed that a large portion of atf <dig> bound active enhancers.fig.  <dig> atf <dig> globally binds genomic sites enriched with p <dig> and h3k27ac. a genome browser views showing co-localization of atf <dig> with p <dig> and h3k27ac in several representative genomic sites. b venn diagram showing overlaps between atf <dig> peaks and p <dig> peaks. c intensity plot showing co-localization of atf <dig> with p <dig> and h3k27ac. d venn diagram showing overlaps between p <dig> distal peaks  and atf <dig> peaks. e chip-qpcr validation of p <dig> binding to the atf <dig> binding sites. hct <dig> cells were subjected to chip using a p <dig> antibody. precipitated dna was quantitated using qpcr. f h3k27ac was enriched in the atf3-binding sites. chip-qpcr was carried out to determine h3k27ac levels in the atf3-binding sites



atf3-regulated gene expression correlates with atf <dig> enhancer binding
an interesting question surfaced as to how atf <dig> binding to genomic sites regulates gene expression. to address this question, we subjected the atf3-wildtype and knockout cells to cdna microarray assays. although atf <dig> bound to  <dig>  genes, only  <dig>  unique genes, including several known atf <dig> targets   <cit> , were differentially expressed between the wt and ko cells . among these genes,  <dig>  were bound by atf <dig> and thus more likely to be directly regulated by atf <dig> . roughly equal numbers of genes was either activated or repressed by atf <dig> , suggesting that atf <dig> can function as both a transcription repressor and a transcription activator. in line with the reported tumor suppressor role in colon cancer  <cit> , atf <dig> appeared to induce expression of genes involving in mitosis and stress responses while repressing genes regulating vasculature development, migration, and apoptosis . we validated  <dig> differentially-expressed genes by quantitative rt-pcr  and their binding by atf <dig> by independent chip-qpcr assays . interestingly, although atf <dig> were often reported to regulate gene expression by binding to a atf <dig> motif localized in promoters, only 15 %  of the atf3-regulated genes identified herein were bound by atf <dig> exclusively at their promoters  . the rest of genes either were bound by atf <dig> exclusively at distal regions , or at both promoters and distal regions  . these results suggest that atf <dig> could regulate gene expression by binding to distal cis-regulatory elements localized in active enhancers. indeed, except mal <dig>  all other validated atf3-target genes were bound by atf <dig> at distal regions overlapped with p <dig> peaks . of the  <dig> genes containing distal atf3-binding sites,  <dig>  were associated with active enhancers enriched with p <dig> and bound by atf <dig> . interestingly, atf3-repressed genes appeared to be more likely to harbor distal atf <dig> regulatory elements than atf3-activated genes , although the tf motifs contained in the atf3-binding sites in these two groups of genes were similar .fig.  <dig> binding of atf <dig> to active enhancers correlates with atf3-regulated gene expression. a heatmaps showing atf3-regulated genes, and their binding by atf <dig> and p <dig>  b qrt-pcr validation of genes differentially expressed between atf3-wildtype and knockout cells identified by microarray. c, d validation of atf <dig> binding to differentially-expressed genes by chip-qpcr. e atf <dig> was localized in regions distal to tss  of differentially-expressed genes. f representative genome browser views of co-localization of atf <dig> and p <dig> in atf3-regulatd genes. g atf <dig> was localized in active enhancers of atf3-regulated genes. error bars represents sd



dna damage alters the atf3-binding landscape for gene regulation
as a common stress sensor, atf <dig> may regulate cellular stress responses by altering the gene expression landscape. to understand how cellular stresses alter genome-wide atf <dig> binding profile for transcriptional regulation, we subjected hct <dig> cells treated with cpt for chip-seq assays. as cpt could increase the atf <dig> expression level   <cit> , it was not surprising that the dna-damaging treatment increased the number of atf3-binding sites to  <dig>   – one fold more than that under the basal condition. however, we found that a large number of sites  bound by atf <dig> under the basal condition were not detected after the cpt treatment . atf <dig> bound these sites more weakly than the remained sites . of the “shared” peaks, dna damage increased atf <dig> binding to  <dig>  sites but decreased its binding to the rest  <dig>  sites . interestingly, while the cpt-increased sites appeared to be bound by atf <dig> more strongly than the cpt-decreased sites under the basal condition , the increased sites were also often bound by p <dig>  or enriched with h3k4me <dig>  suggesting that dna damage promoted atf <dig> to bind to active enhancers . in contrast, cpt tended to decrease atf <dig> binding to those sites localized in promoters and thus often flanked by a high level of h3k4me <dig>  <cit>  . consistent with these observations, although dna damage did not significantly change the overall genome distribution and motif composition of the atf <dig> binding sites , it promoted atf <dig> to bind to the sites distal to tss . similarly, dna damage increased the number of sites bound by both atf <dig> and p <dig>  and the number of these atf3-bound active enhancers was increased from 37 % under the basal condition to  <dig>  % upon stress . interestingly, the new sites bound by atf <dig> after dna damage  had weaker atf3-binding affinities than the sites bound by atf <dig> under the basal condition , but had stronger affinities than those lost peaks . our results thus suggest that atf <dig> not only increased its level, but also altered its genome binding in response to dna damage.fig.  <dig> dna damage alters the atf3-binding landscape for transcriptional regulation. a venn diagram showing overlap of atf3-binding peaks between the basal  and the cpt-treated  conditions. b heatmaps and intensity plots showing alterations in the atf3-binding profile caused by dna damage. c intensity plots showing different enrichments of atf <dig>  p <dig>  and histone markers between cpt-induced and decreased peaks. d distribution of atf3-binding sites under basal  and stressed  conditions. e venn diagram showing overlaps of atf <dig> peaks and p <dig> peaks under the cpt-treatment condition. f heatmaps showing cpt-regulated genes. g heatmaps of atf3-binding sites associated with cpt-regulated genes showing that atf <dig> was pre-loaded on most of these genes before stress. h intensity plot showing that atf <dig> binding to cpt-regulated genes was increased by the cpt treatment. i heatmap showing atf3-regulated genes under the dna damage condition were pre-bound by atf <dig>  j intensity plot showing that dna damage increased atf <dig> binding to atf3-regulated genes



we next addressed the question as to what changes in gene expression the altered atf3-binding would cause under the dna damage condition. treating hct <dig> cells with cpt for 4 h resulted in an increase in expression of  <dig> genes and a decrease in expression of  <dig> genes  .  <dig>   of these altered genes were bound by atf <dig> after dna damage , and thus were more likely regulated by atf <dig>  interestingly,  <dig>  % of atf3-bound, cpt-regulated genes were also bound by atf <dig> before the cells were treated with cpt , suggesting that atf <dig> were pre-loaded on the genomic sites for gene regulation under stressed conditions. however, stressed atf <dig> appeared to bind these sites more strongly than the quiescent protein . given that cpt equally increased or decreased atf <dig> binding on the “shared” sites , these results indicate that dna damage selectively promoted atf <dig> to bind to genomic sites associated with regulated genes.

to further determine the relationship between atf <dig> binding and gene regulation under the stressed condition, we analyzed the gene expression data for atf <dig> knockout cells, and generated a curated list of  <dig> genes that were judged, with high confidence, as atf3-regulated genes in response to dna damage , based on  that fold changes before and after the cpt treatment were significantly different  between atf3-wildtype and -knockout cells,  that the genes bound by atf <dig> with a small binding score  and thus more likely to be derived from experimental errors were excluded. once again, while  <dig>  of these genes had already been bound by atf <dig> under the basal condition, cpt further increased atf <dig> binding to these regulated genes, regardless whether their expression was induced or repressed by cpt . interestingly, about a half  of these genes contained one or more active enhancers that were bound by both p <dig> and atf <dig> , consistent with our previous conclusion that atf <dig> can bind to active enhancers to regulate gene expression.

atf <dig> collaborates with p <dig> in regulating target gene expression
p <dig> is a master transcription factor that transactivates genes  essential for driving cellular responses  to dna damage  <cit> . as atf <dig> can bind p <dig>  <cit>  and we also found that atf3-bound genes engage in the p <dig> signaling pathway , we sought to determine how atf <dig> interacts with p <dig> at genomic sites to regulate gene expression in response to cpt-induced dna damage. we first profiled global p <dig> binding by subjecting cpt-treated hct <dig> cells to chip-seq analysis. we identified  <dig>  p53-binding peaks , a number which was low but within the same range  as other reports . these identified binding sites included  <dig> previously-characterized p53-binding sites in the cdkn1a enhancer and promoter regions    <cit> , and sites localized in the promoters of well-characterized p <dig> target genes mdm <dig>  bbc <dig> and bax . these p53-binding sites were validated by independent chip-qpcr assays . consistent with the notion that atf <dig> is a p <dig> regulator  <cit> , we found that atf <dig> bound to  <dig>  %  of p53-binding sites , including the cdkn1a site a , and the sites associated with gadd45a, mdm <dig> and igfl <dig> . using re-chip assays, we confirmed that atf <dig> was co-localized with p <dig> at site a, but not site c, of cdkn1a, and other tested genomic sites associated with gadd45a, mdm <dig>  igfl <dig>  gsn, and bbc <dig> . of these atf3/p <dig> co-localized sites,  <dig> only carried a p <dig> motif,  <dig> only carried an atf <dig> motif, and  <dig> harbored both motifs . given that atf <dig> can directly bind p <dig>  <cit> , co-localization of atf <dig> with p <dig> at genomic sites might be owing to p53-mediated recruitment of atf <dig> to sites containing the p <dig> motif, and/or atf3-mediated recruitment of p <dig> to sites harboring the atf <dig> motif. indeed, we found a strong correlation between the atf3-binding score and the p <dig> peak score at these genomic sites . moreover, p <dig> depletion dramatically impaired atf <dig> binding to  <dig> out of  <dig> tested p53-motif-only sites . of note, although p <dig> was previously shown to be required for atf <dig> induction by dna damage caused by γ-irradiation  <cit> , we did not see decreased atf <dig> expression in p53-knockout cells under our experimental condition . the reason why p <dig> knockout did not decrease atf <dig> binding to the cdkn1a site a and the gdf <dig> p53-binding site that lacked the atf <dig> motif was unclear, but other tfs might recruit atf <dig> to these sites. interestingly, p <dig> binding to the sites containing only the atf <dig> motif was significantly decreased by atf <dig> knockout as well , suggesting that atf <dig> could also recruit p <dig> to genomic sites that do not contain a p <dig> motif. thus, the atf3-p <dig> interaction might expand the list of genes that can be regulated by p <dig>  interestingly,  <dig>  %  of the atf3/p <dig> co-localized sites, including the site associated with cdkn1a, bbc <dig> and gdf <dig>  were also enriched with p <dig>  suggesting that many of these sites were active enhancers and thus the atf3-p <dig> interaction on genomic sites were likely functional. indeed, we demonstrated that knockout of atf <dig> expression impaired cpt-induced cdkn1a, bbc <dig>  and gdf <dig> expression . therefore, our results indicate that atf <dig> could interact with p <dig> at genomic sites thereby regulating gene expression in the dna damage response.fig.  <dig> co-localization of atf <dig> and p <dig> in genomic sites regulates gene expression in

discussion
it is often shown that atf <dig> binds the atf/cre cis-acting element localized in gene promoters and regulate expression of genes associated with human diseases . we carried out this study in light of the fact that a genome-wide atf3-binding profile in the human genome was lacking. employing engineered atf3-knockout cells as the specificity control, we identified  <dig>  specific atf3-binding sites across the human genome under the basal condition. although this number was surprisingly large given that the basal atf <dig> expression level was low, it was comparable to  <dig>  sites identified in mouse dendritic cells  <cit> . as  <dig>  % of the atf3-binding sites contained a known atf <dig> motif   <cit> , atf <dig> might directly bind a majority of these sites. it was thus likely that the low level of constitutively-expressed atf <dig> was sufficient to bind most of available sites in the genome. interestingly, atf <dig>  a family member sharing the same binding motif with atf <dig>  binds only  <dig>  sites in the mouse genome  <cit> . while this difference might be owing to different dna-binding affinity, interactions with other transcription regulators could poise atf <dig> for a higher level of genome binding. the latter possibility is supported by the fact that atf <dig> differs from atf <dig> in its ability of interacting with other proteins  <cit> . it is worth noting that the atf <dig> genome-occupancy level is lower than that of pioneer factors, which often bind more than  <dig>  genomic sites  <cit> , but significantly higher than that of most of gene-specific tfs  that generally occupy a few thousands of genomic sites . it is thus tempting to hypothesize that atf <dig> serves as a molecular beacon, or “primer factor”, that binds genomic sites subsequent to binding of pioneer factors, and directs other tfs or transcription co-regulators to appropriate genomic sites upon stimulation  <cit> . this hypothesis was partly supported by the findings that atf <dig> directly interacts with many tfs   <cit>  and histone modifying enzymes   <cit> . importantly, while the go analysis revealed that the atf3-bound genes were associated with cellular response to stress under the basal condition , we found that the genes whose expression was regulated by dna damage were often pre-bound by atf <dig> . thus, like the transcription factor p <dig>  <cit> , atf <dig> might bookmark genes for transcriptional regulation. in this regard, it is likely that atf <dig> recruits diverse sets of tfs to genomic sites pre-bound by atf <dig> upon varying stimuli, thereby regulating gene expression and mounting rapid, appropriate responses to varying cellular stresses. however, dna damage-induced changes in atf <dig> binding were more dynamic than what the “primer-factor” hypothesis suggests  <cit> . dna damage not only increased the number of atf <dig> binding sites by  <dig> fold, but abolished up to one-fifth of the basal binding events . in addition, cpt increased atf <dig> binding to some genomic sites but decreased its binding to almost equal numbers of other sites. while stress-induced loss of genomic binding has also been reported for other stress-inducible tfs   <cit> , the decrease in atf <dig> binding to a substantial number of genomic sites argues against the notion that the dynamic changes in atf <dig> binding was a mere consequence of elevated atf <dig> expression induced by dna. as dna damage can alter chromatin structure , it might allow access of some genomic sites to, while shielding other sites from, atf <dig>  interestingly, the cpt treatment appeared to promote atf <dig> to bind to sites distal to tss . while the exact mechanism remains elusive, it might be that the epigenetic environments where the distal sites reside are favorable for tf binding. indeed, these distal sites often coincide with p300/h3k27ac-enriched active enhancers , which are known to have lower nucleosomal density  <cit> .

like other tfs  <cit> , binding of atf <dig> to the regulatory region of a gene did not always result in a change in gene expression. indeed, although atf <dig> bound more than  <dig>  genes, a complete loss of atf <dig> expression only altered expression of a small number of genes under both the quiescent and the stressed condition. while rna-based assays  may not serve as accurate measurements of transcription activity  <cit> , other tfs capable of binding the same motifs   <cit>  might compensate for atf <dig> loss. interestingly, the atf3-binding sites often contained motifs of other tfs in addition to the atf <dig> motif , suggesting that atf <dig> might act in concert with other tfs to regulate gene expression. our results also indicate that atf <dig> can activate or repress gene expression depending on gene context. while the location and motif composition of the atf3-binding site did not appear to determine whether atf <dig> activates or represses gene expression , it is very likely that the epigenetic environment surrounding the atf3-binding sites determine the availability of transcription co-activators , or transcription co-repressors , which consequently transactivate or repress expression of atf3-bound genes. thus, the early notion that atf <dig> homodimers and heterodimers respectively repress and activate transcription appears oversimplified and misleading.

an important finding from this study is that atf <dig> bound to 37 % of genomic sites that were bound by p <dig> and characterized by high levels of h3k27ac under the basal condition . these genomic sites are defined as active enhancers and have been shown to contain functional regulatory elements that drive proximal gene expression during embryonic development  <cit> . interestingly, dna damage increased the percentage of active enhancers bound by atf <dig> to  <dig>  %. moreover, although atf <dig> binding alone was not sufficient to regulate transcription, most of genes regulated by atf <dig> appeared localized proximal to atf3-bound active enhancers . this strong correlation between tf binding to active enhancers and the regulation of gene expression was not without precedent. the transcription factor p <dig>  for instance, was recently shown to bind h3k27ac-enriched active enhancers, and the binding correlates with dynamic gene expression regulated by p <dig> during epidermal differentiation  <cit> . as active enhancers often contain a cluster of motifs allowing for binding by multiple tfs, it is likely that these tfs collaboratively interact with the basal transcription machinery in core promoters to regulate gene expression. therefore, the observed correlation between enhancer binding and transcriptional regulation is consistent with our notion that atf <dig> needs to cooperate with other tfs to regulate gene expression.

the tumor suppressor p <dig> drives a transcription program for eliciting diverse cellular responses to dna damage. previously, we reported that atf <dig> can activate p <dig> by binding and directly blocking its ubiquitination  <cit> . we also found that atf <dig> can induce p <dig> activation by promoting the activity of a histone acetyltransferase tip <dig> and the subsequent activation of atm  <cit> . in this study, we revealed an additional mechanism by which atf <dig> regulates p <dig>  i.e., co-localization with p <dig> at genomic sites. indeed, we found that atf <dig> was co-localized with p <dig> at more than 20 % of p53-binding sites identified by chip-seq . as atf <dig> can interact with p <dig>  <cit> , such co-localization might be a consequence of p53-mediated atf <dig> recruiting , or vice versa . on the other hand, some co-localized genomic sites contained both the p <dig> and the atf <dig> motif, and thus could be bound by p <dig> and atf <dig> simultaneously. regardless, close proximity between atf <dig> and p <dig> at genomic sites might directly alter p <dig> conformation thereby regulating the p <dig> transcriptional activity . our results are supported by a recent report, which carried out atf <dig> chip-chip assays and shows binding of atf <dig> to promoters of many known p <dig> target genes  <cit> . however, our study indicates that a large number of co-localized sites were far beyond promoter regions  <cit>  and were also often bound by p <dig>  therefore, the genomic co-localization of atf <dig> and p <dig> serves as an additional mechanism for fine tuning p <dig> activity in the dna damage response.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that atf <dig> likely preoccupies genomic sites regulatory for genes involved in the cellular stress response, and thus bookmarks these sites for transcriptional regulation under basal and stressed conditions.
