BACKGROUND
trypanosoma brucei subspecies are unicellular pathogens that infect humans, as well as domestic and wild animals. the infections of humans are fatal without treatment, and the treatments are suboptimal due to resistance, toxicity, and cost. furthermore, no vaccine is available due to rampant antigenic variation in which hundreds of variant surface glycoproteins  are sequentially displayed on the parasite surface  <cit> . additionally, this group of organisms, along with their relatives trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax, have hampered the development of sub-saharan africa by their severe effects on cattle and draft animals.

in both the mammalian host and the insect vector , t. brucei undergoes multiple developmental changes that are reflected by changes in morphology, surface proteins, cell division, and metabolism, although all stages are extracellular and motile, courtesy of a single flagellum. when first injected into the mammalian host by the bite of a tsetse fly, the stationary metacyclic phase parasites re-enter the cell cycle as rapidly dividing slender bloodstream forms . this stage relies on glycolysis for the generation of atp, and has a single tubular mitochondrion. after several days, short stumpy forms appear. these forms are arrested in g0/g <dig> and still express vsg, but show modest metabolic changes that appear to presage the next stage of parasite development  <cit> . when taken up by the fly, they readily transform into procyclic forms  that multiply in the insect midgut. this stage of the parasite expresses a different surface coat, made up of a small family of proteins termed procyclins  <cit> . glycolysis is down-regulated, amino acid metabolism is induced, and the mitochondrion enlarges and more elaborate cristae develop. after one to two weeks, the pfs journey to the salivary glands where they transform into epimastigotes and then into mammalian-infective metacyclic forms  <cit> . while t. brucei slender bfs and pfs are routinely cultured in vitro, epimastigotes and metacyclic forms are not readily available.

in contrast to most other organisms, trypanosomatids do not regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, except for the major surface antigens of african trypanosomes such as t. brucei  <cit> . almost all genes are transcribed as large polycistronic clusters, but adjacent genes may show widely differing levels of mrna, and these levels may vary during the parasite life cycle. this developmental regulation of mrna abundance is largely attained via changes in decay rate, predominantly attributed to sequences within the 3' untranslated region   <cit> . early studies of changes in gene expression between slender bf and pf suggested that only about 2% of probes showed significant changes in signal between stages  <cit> . however, these initial studies relied on arrays that utilized relatively large anonymous fragments of the genome as probes , and used a cutoff of  <dig> -fold change between minimum and maximum signal. the elucidation of the complete genome of t. brucei strain  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit>  affords the opportunity to examine global changes in mrna expression using a gene-specific approach. a recent study examined a subset of about  <dig> genes for their expression in bf as compared to pf parasites  <cit> . the genes were selected on the basis of their potential for regulation, based on analysis of the literature, and many were found to be stage-regulated. more recently, microarrays have been used to search for changes in gene expression following knockdown or knockout of genes encoding rna binding proteins  <cit> .

until now, the microarray studies performed on t. brucei have been either sub-genomic or have utilized a single probe for each gene. in this study, we have used nimblegen microarrays that employed eight probes per gene to assess gene expression in t. brucei  <dig>  examining the stages which are readily obtained in the laboratory. those stages included in vitro cultured slender bf , as well as slender and stumpy bf harvested from infected rats. we also studied both log and stationary phase pfs . our results revealed that mrna expression in cbf was little different from that seen in the slender bfs harvested from rats. a modest number  of changes were seen in stumpy bf. as expected, many changes were observed when cbf and pf-log parasites were compared, with several hundred genes showing at least a 2-fold change in mrna abundance. surprisingly, comparison of pf-log and pf-stat parasites showed an even larger number of changes. the arrays not only allowed us to compare differences between stages, but also to examine expression levels of various genes within a sample. about half of genes ranked in the top 10% of signals in cbf were also expressed to high levels in all other stages. a significant fraction of these highly expressed genes encoded hypothetical proteins. very few genes showed no evidence of expression.

RESULTS
this study reports our findings on changes in gene expression between those stages of t. brucei that can be readily studied in the laboratory. during natural infections in the vertebrate host, t. brucei progresses from the actively dividing slender bf to the non-dividing stumpy bf. this form is primed for differentiation to procyclic forms in the insect host. we examined the expression level of nearly all predicted protein-coding genes of strain  <dig> t. brucei, as well as many rna genes, in five different parasite populations. most of the analyses reported here are restricted to nuclearly encoded transcripts, although some findings for mitochondrially derived transcripts are noted. three biological replicates were used for each test condition. three of the five sets were derived from in vitro culture under highly standardized conditions: log-phase cultured bloodstream forms , log-phase cultured procyclic forms , and stationary-phase procyclic forms  . the remaining two samples, slender bf and stumpy bf, were derived from infected rats and were likely to show more inter-sample variability, since they were grown for varying times in rats, and the animals became progressively less healthy after irradiation and infection. since the stumpy bf populations were the last to be harvested and each contained a variable proportion of intermediately differentiated forms, these populations were the most biologically variable. they ranged from 76% to 93% morphologically stumpy and 68% to 88% of cells expressed the pf marker ep procyclin upon appropriate stimulation . the slender bf populations showed less than 5% intermediate or stumpy forms and less than 1% expressed procyclin after stimulation.

the nimblegen arrays that were hybridized with cdna prepared from each parasite population contained multiple probes per gene , and three copies of these probe-sets per chip. after normalization to allow for cross-chip comparisons, we calculated a single value for each set of triplicate probes using tukey's biweight formula. we then obtained a single gene level value using the tukey biweight of the signals for the probes corresponding to each gene . in most cases, this value represented the "average" of  <dig> data points collected for every protein-coding gene  in each of the five growth conditions. thus, as detailed in methods, we were able to utilize robust statistical analyses that increase our confidence in the findings of the comparisons reported below.

gene expression levels
the normalized expression values from the  <dig> probe-sets corresponding to nuclear genes were hierarchically clustered using the tmev software package and are shown graphically as a heat map in figure 1a. a small number of genes  showed no or very low expression under any condition, and a similar number  showed high expression levels in some  or all  conditions. however, the large majority of the genes showed low  or moderate  expression levels. each biological sample set showed a similar distribution of signal intensities obtained for the  <dig> probe-sets corresponding to nuclear protein-coding genes, with the curves obtained from cbf and pf-stat  shown figure 1b. this figure also depicts the signals obtained for the  <dig> probe-sets that map to multicopy cdss. this curve was skewed dramatically to the right, as compared to the total sample of probe-sets, confirming gene amplification as a clear strategy for increasing gene expression in t. brucei. indeed,  <dig> of the  <dig> probe-sets detecting the highest signals map to two or more genes . however, the signals did not follow in rank order of number of genes detected by the probe-sets.

anumber of genes detected by probe set

basterisk indicates gene is regulated at least two-fold between highest and lowest sample sets.

for the total probe-sets, there is a large peak centered at ~ <dig> for the pf-stat and ~ <dig> for cbf. in both cases, the peak moves sharply down towards lower values, with a small shoulder at ~ <dig>  when the same arrays were probed with rna derived from a different strain, this shoulder was more pronounced, and a corresponding increase in probe-sets with signal intensities less than  <dig> was observed . since many of these probe-sets mapped to vsgs, most of which are not conserved between strains, a signal level of ~ <dig> can be taken as a generous estimate of background for non-transcribed regions. however, almost all regions of the t. brucei genome are thought to be constitutively transcribed, and hence even those genes whose mrnas are unstable would likely show a signal higher than this background. the number of probe-sets that failed to show a signal level of less than four times the "non-transcribed background" signal  in least one of the five different biological conditions was small . even then, vsg genes, which are subject to clonal variations in expression, accounted for all but  <dig> of this set. the majority  of the remaining genes have unknown function, with most of these  found only in t. brucei, raising the possibility that they do not represent authentic genes. in addition, almost all of these low-expressing genes are located in sub-telomeric clusters of vsgs or expression site associated genes  or are immediately adjacent to convergent strand-switch regions where transcription terminates  <cit> . even when considering only cbf parasites, only  <dig> predicted non-vsg protein-coding genes had a signal < <dig>  and of these only  <dig> had annotated function. notably, most of these genes were expressed to higher levels in at least one other stage, and those that were low in all stages were located in a sub-telomeric or convergent strand-switch region context.

the protein-coding genes were ranked according to their maximal expression level in any stage, and broadly categorized according to their annotated function . as suggested above, vsg genes and t. brucei-specific genes of unknown function accounted for most of the genes showing the lowest expression . conversely, genes which are more highly expressed tend to have some type of functional annotation; indeed many of these have been studied experimentally.

we identified the nuclear cdss with the top 10% of signals for each biological condition. the genes were individually examined and placed into categories based on their annotation and/or their proteomic detection in specific sub-cellular fractions. figure 2a shows the distribution of these genes into broad categories as in figure 1c, while figure 2b shows the distribution of genes with ascribed function  according to various categories of biological function or location for the each of the five different biological conditions. as indicated in figure 1c, above, genes with unknown function were under-represented in the highly expressed category, as compared to the whole genome, and this was most striking in the pf-log cells . overall, the categories with the largest numbers of highly expressed genes were translation, metabolism, or cytoskeleton, with the majority  of the genes in the translation category encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. genes involved in mitochondrial function were highly represented in the top expressors in the pf stages, but more modestly represented in bf stages. as expected, significantly higher proportions of esags or genes related to them  were expressed at high levels in all bf stages than in the pf stages. in general, relatively similar proportion of genes were found in each category in all biological stages, although the number of genes involved in metabolism was increased in pf-log and genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins decreased in stumpy bf. however, this does not mean that the same genes are expressed to high levels in all stages. for example, 13% of mrnas highly expressed in cbf were more than 2-fold up-regulated as compared to pf and similarly 12% of mrnas highly expressed in pf were more than 2-fold up-regulated as compared to cbf .

among the  <dig> most highly expressed nuclear cdss in cbf,  <dig> were highly expressed in every condition examined. surprisingly,  <dig> of these had unknown function. thus, there is a large set of highly expressed t. brucei-specific  or conserved  genes that have not been ascribed a function; including nine of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in cbf . some of the "hypothetical" proteins encoded by these nine genes have been shown to exist by proteomic analyses  or other studies . conversely, two other "hypothetical genes" lie in intergenic regions between coding regions that are highly expressed, raising the possibility that these are not separate genes, but rather simply sequences within 3' utrs of the neighboring genes. the first, as represented by tb <dig> . <dig>  is one of a set of seven almost identical putative genes  that are interspersed between the histone h <dig> genes. the second, as represented by tb <dig> . <dig>  corresponds to a set of genes that are interspersed between the highly expressed cfb <dig> genes. tb <dig>  encodes a putative protein which is composed of  <dig> repeats of  <dig> amino acids and is represented on the microarray by a single probe corresponding to a unique sequence at the c-terminus. tb <dig> . <dig> specifies a  <dig> kda protein with a signal sequence and three transmembrane domains. it is expressed to a much higher level than the flanking genes, indicating it is a distinct mrna. the last of these nine genes, tb <dig> . <dig>  encodes a  <dig> kda protein that is also expressed much more highly than the adjacent genes.

differential gene expression
comparison of the tukey mean maximum and minimum signal levels for all probe-sets corresponding to nuclear genes revealed  <dig> genes that showed a greater than 10-fold change between two or more of the five biological conditions tested. of these,  <dig> were vsg, vsg-related  genes, or esag/gresags, many of which are associated with antigenic variation. a total of  <dig> genes  showed more than 4-fold variation, while at the 2-fold level,  <dig> genes  showed a statistically supported difference in expression. thus, over one-fourth of all of the genes assessed on the microarray were differentially expressed ) between at least two conditions. this dataset was further reduced to those showing a >2-fold deviation from the mean of all five conditions in at least one sample, and by excluding all genes encoding vsg/vrs and esag/gresags . these  <dig> probe-sets were k-median clustered using settings indicated in the methods to yield nine clusters which contained between  <dig> and  <dig> genes . each of these clusters represents a distinct pattern of gene expression, although some are similar. overall, these highly regulated genes are enriched in those involved in metabolism, proteolysis, translation and t. brucei-specific unknown functions, but under-represented in those genes that are conserved but have unknown function. however, individual clusters show differential enrichment in particular functional gene categories.

clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show different patterns of up-regulation with respect to the two pf biological conditions. cluster  <dig> contains genes that are up-regulated in pf-log, but not in pf-stat. for some genes this change in expression begins in stumpy bfs. the genes in this cluster are over-represented for those encoding proteins involved in interaction, metabolism, rna processing, transcription, translation and cytoskeleton function. their reduced expression in pf-stat is consistent with cessation of growth functions upon entry into stationary phase. indeed we observed a significant accumulation of rrna precursors in the pf-stat samples upon analysis on the agilent bioanalyzer . conversely, cluster  <dig> contains genes that are up-regulated only in pf-stat and mostly have unknown function, including eight that are t. brucei-specific. it is possible that some of these gene products are involved in preparation for differentiation into epimastigotes, the next stage in the parasite life cycle. finally, cluster  <dig> contains genes with higher expression levels in both pf-log and pf-stat and is enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism, proteolysis, or with unknown function but located on the cell surface or mitochondrion. as discussed in more detail below, this is consistent with the switch to mitochondrial pathways for energy generation in procyclics.

cluster  <dig> contains the largest number of genes, with  <dig> members. the expression of these genes is lower in pf-stat , but the genes are expressed at higher levels in cbf and slender bf than seen in cluster  <dig>  these genes are over-represented in those involved in metabolism, dna replication/repair, protein folding, proteolysis and translation, consistent with their down-regulation in stationary-phase cells. cluster  <dig>  with  <dig> members, is the smallest cluster. the pattern of gene regulation is similar to cluster  <dig>  but with some up-regulation in pf-log. like cluster  <dig>  this cluster is enriched in genes involved in dna replication/repair.

the existence of these varied expression patterns implies a complex set of regulatory mechanisms operating at the rna level to control the abundance of transcripts encoded by nuclear genes. the specific proteins involved in these processes are only beginning to be examined .

in contrast to the analyses above that examined the transcripts showing the most variation in abundance, we also looked at the transcripts that showed the least variation. genes such as these would provide excellent controls for studies of developmental changes in gene expression. we identified  <dig> genes with a maximum variation in expression between the five stages of <25% . as expected, genes encoding proteins involved in known stage-regulated processes such as glycolysis and electron transport are significantly under-represented. however, the group is slightly enriched for genes of unknown function. genes encoding proteins involved in lipid or fatty acid metabolism are also over-represented, comprising 28% of the metabolic enzymes that showed little variation as opposed to 11% of all metabolic enzymes. similarly, genes encoding proteins of the ubiquitin pathway represent 40% of all protease-related genes, but 85% of the subset of protease-related genes that showed little variation. genes involved in histone acetylation or chromatin structure, such as tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig>  also tended to maintain similar mrna levels between life cycle stages.

comparison of cbf and log phase pf forms
in order to identify differences in gene expression between specific conditions, we conducted pair-wise comparisons of specific datasets  using sam, setting the q-value to <5% and the fold-change to > <dig> . because vsg expression is both clonal and highly variable, vsgs are excluded from the gene tallies below, unless otherwise noted.

comparing the signals between cbf and pf-log,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed. when the stringency of the sam analysis was reduced to a  <dig> -fold change,  <dig> genes were detected. a further reduction to  <dig> -fold identified  <dig> genes--approximately 19% of the genome. thus, a relatively large fraction of the genome encodes mrnas that differ in abundance between these two stages. figure 4a shows a comparison of the functional categories of the genes showing >2-fold regulation; these are individually listed  in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig> itemizes those genes upregulated in cbf that have predicted functions .

aesags, gresags, vsgs are not included. a complete list of the genes is found in additional file  <dig> 

bbold: gene was upregulated in all bf vs all pf conditions. probe-sets detecting > <dig> gene indicated by "+", plus number of additional genes.

as can be seen in figure 4a, categories of genes where cbf show higher expression than pf-log cells include esags and gresags, uncharacterized proteins bearing interaction motifs , and known surface and secreted proteins . however, it is also interesting that a larger number of genes upregulated in cbf encode proteins with hypothetical status  that have signal sequences. this fits well with the finding that the secretory and endocytic systems are more active in bf than pf  <cit> . however, unlike koumandou et al.  <cit> , we did not find that mrnas specifying proteins involved in secretory traffic were highly up-regulated in bf.

categories with more representatives up-regulated in pf-log cells include those encoding mitochondrial proteins, metabolic proteins, and translation. it is known that the metabolism of pf  is more complex than bf   <cit> , presumably accounting for the more diverse set of metabolic genes up-regulated in pf-log cells. in pf, the mitochondrion becomes enlarged with more fully developed cristae and the respiratory chain is active  <cit> . these changes are reflected in the increased expression of a large number of genes  encoding products associated with the mitochondrion, including  <dig> that are of unknown function. in contrast, a single gene known to encode a mitochondrial protein is upregulated in cbf: the alternative oxidase. this oxidase is required for the glycerophosphate shuttle that allows glycolysis to continue  <cit> .

the comparison of mrna abundance between these two stages led to the identification of several groups of interesting genes. these include those encoding nucleoside transporters nt2-nt <dig> which reside in an array immediately adjacent to the sub-telomeric vsg cluster at the "right" end of chromosome  <dig>  there they alternate with a set of iron-ascorbate oxidoreductase genes  that have not been functionally characterized to our knowledge. the nt genes were reported to be more highly expressed in bf than pf forms, a finding which we also observe  <cit> . interestingly, all of these oxidoreductase genes are also significantly more highly expressed in cbf than pf-log . three additional iron/ascorbate oxidoreductase genes are found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> -- these are each expressed to similar levels in cbf and pf-log. thus, the chromosome  <dig> region represents a rare cluster of genes encoding similarly regulated mrnas. another interesting case is that of vsp <dig>  an acidocalcisomal pyrophosphatase encoded by two tandemly linked genes  with almost identical coding regions  <cit> . the array data show that the two genes are reciprocally regulated, which may potentially be traced to their divergent 3' utrs.

comparison of gene expression in bf under different conditions
we compared the expression of all nuclear genes in slender bf isolated from infected animals with the expression in slender bf obtained by in vitro culture  and the expression in stumpy bf from animals. in comparison of cbf and slender bf, other than a few vsg genes, no gene showed a difference in expression that met our criteria of a 2-fold change and q-value < 5%. additional file  <dig> lists those genes that showed more moderate  or less well-supported changes . however, two isg <dig> genes  showed a slightly lower , but high-confidence increase in signal in slender bf. a few other genes showed similar  changes in expression, but had somewhat lower confidence . these included a camk group protein kinase , a nucleoside phosphorylase , a tryparedoxin  and two proteins with unknown function that had higher signals in cbf, and a gresag <dig> that had a higher signal in slender bf. these data contrast with a previous microarray study examining  <dig> genes that found  <dig> were upregulated in cbf and  <dig> were upregulated in slender bf  <cit> . none of those  <dig> genes correspond to the few genes that we identified above. two sets of genes that we identified as modestly upregulated were on the previous array, but these were not observed to be upregulated in that analysis. the lack of consistency between the two studies in this regard could arise from differences in the strains or conditions . nonetheless both studies do suggest that in vitro cultivation provides a reasonable model for analysis of most mrnas in slender bf.

a comparison of the rapidly dividing slender bf with the non-dividing stumpy bf showed a total of  <dig> genes with at least a 2-fold change in signal in the arrays, not including vsgs. about twice as many genes were up-regulated in slender forms  as were up-regulated in stumpy forms . the most prominent categories of genes showing increased signals in slender forms are those that are related to the cytoskeleton, including the flagellum . many of these genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins, but they were detected in the flagellar proteome  <cit> . non-dividing forms do not build new flagella or cytoskeleton. additionally, several metabolic enzymes were up-regulated, predominantly those which are localized to the glycosome  or are involved in glycolysis. conversely, the entire set of eight esag <dig> genes in the  <dig> strain were upregulated in stumpy bf , as were two genes that are related to esag <dig>  the function of esag <dig> is not known; it was originally described as a gene found in a vsg expression site  in the closely related parasite trypanosoma equiperdum  <cit> . at that time, the authors noted that a related esag <dig> was transcribed independently of the vsg es. seven of the eight annotated esag <dig> genes encode proteins with a predicted signal sequence, but none of these contain predicted transmembrane domains, suggesting the esag9s could encode a family of secreted proteins. the metabolic enzymes encoded by genes with higher mrna levels in stumpy bf were predominantly mitochondrial, consistent with pre-adaptation for differentiation into insect forms. we also noted the increased mrna for the pad <dig> and pad <dig> genes, which encode citrate transporters and were previously shown to be upregulated in stumpy forms of t. brucei strain eatro  <dig>  <cit> .

a fold-change as calculated by sam analysis are shown; some genes showed 2-fold difference in tukey means.

comparison of gene expression of pf in different conditions
unlike cbf, in vitro cultured pf can be grown to stationary phase where they can persist for several days as viable cultures. thus, we could directly compare the abundance of mrnas in actively replicating  and non-dividing  cells. a total of  <dig> genes showed differential expression , many more than the  <dig> genes differentially regulated between with the slender  versus stumpy  bf. about three times as many genes were up-regulated in pf-log as compared to pf-stat. as shown in figure 4c, this increase was reflected across almost all categories of genes, except for proteins categorized as unknown . the most skewed group was genes annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins  that have predicted transmembrane domains -- many more such genes were upregulated in stationary phase than in log phase. for proteins with ascribed function, those associated with protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation were enriched in stationary phase. as discussed above, some of changes in pf-stat may reflect the decrease in cellular growth functions, or perhaps preparation for development to epimastigotes. it is also possible that some transcripts with higher signals in pf-stat are simply those that decay most slowly.

genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome
several genes on the mitochondrial maxicircle genome are extensively remodeled by rna editing to yield transcripts encoding components of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. only  <dig> mitochondrial probe-sets could be designed . four corresponded to both edited and unedited sequences, and six to never-edited sequences, including the two rrnas. three corresponded to edited sequences, two of which had corresponding unedited probe-sets. from this limited set, a few trends could be observed, which were compatible with prior literature  <cit> . for example, 12s and 9s rrna, cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase subunit i, and cytochrome oxidase subunit ii  transcripts all increased in stumpy bf and further increased in pf-log, although some did not reach statistical significance until pf-log phase. somewhat surprisingly, atp synthase subunit  <dig> , nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  and nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  all showed increased mrna levels in stumpy bf, but decreased in pf-log. unexpectedly, many of the signals reached their maximum in pf-stat. this could reflect a potential differential stability as compared to the nuclearly-encoded transcripts under conditions of growth arrest, and would be highlighted by the normalization procedure.

gene families
we noted several tandem arrays of gene families containing non-identical genes that were differentially regulated. three families encoding proteins with multiple transmembrane domains are depicted in figure  <dig>  the first cluster  of genes are those in the recently described pad array of carboxylate transporters  <cit> . in contrast to pad <dig> and pad <dig>  which are induced in stumpy bf  <cit> , the other members of this gene family are either constitutively expressed at the mrna level or more highly expressed in pf. pad <dig> and pad <dig> show an increase in expression from stumpy forms to pf-log and even higher expression in pf-stat. pad <dig> showed similar expression in all conditions except in pf-stat, which was ~ <dig> -fold increased over pf-log . figure 5b shows an unrelated gene family on chromosome  <dig> that also encodes major facilitator proteins. these four genes show a high level of conservation with one another, with long stretches of amino acid identity. two are most highly expressed in bf, whereas the other two show a more complex pattern of regulation. the final set of genes  encodes a set of related proteins predicted to have four to five transmembrane domains, four of these genes are tandemly arrayed on chromosome  <dig>  here the mrna abundances of the three most closely related genes are higher in the bf samples. in contrast, the first gene in the array and another more divergent, unlinked gene on chromosome  <dig> do not show this pattern, and have similar or higher expression in pf.

vsgs and esags
the t. brucei strain  <dig> genome contains approximately  <dig> vsg genes , but each bf trypanosome expresses only a single vsg, which covers the surface of the parasite in a dense coat. although t. brucei possesses ~ <dig> vsg ess   <cit> , the expressed vsg gene encoding the surface coat protein is located in the sole active es. in bf, transcription initiates in all ess, but attenuates rapidly in the inactive ess, never reaching the downstream genes including the resident vsg  <cit> . similarly, transcription of ess initiates in pf, but transcript elongation is minimal  <cit> . a relatively small number of apparently functional vsg genes exist on the  <dig> megabase-sized chromosomes in t. brucei. the minichromosomes also contain a reservoir of apparently functional vsg genes, but only a few have been sequenced. in contrast, most vsg genes reside in sub-telomeric arrays that are comprised of pseudogenes  and atypical vsg genes, which encode proteins that are neither clearly pseudogenes nor clearly functional  <cit> . the pseudogenes provide the fuel for generating novel vsg genes by mosaic gene conversion during antigenic variation, particularly later in infection  <cit> . the vsg-related vr genes are located not in the telomeric ess or sub-telomeric arrays, but rather typically reside in chromosome-internal strand-switch regions and lack the 70-bp repeats typically found upstream of vsg genes  <cit> . the telomeric ess and sub-telomeric vsg arrays also contain hundreds of esags, many of which are pseudogenes. however, a number of genes related to esags  have chromosomal-internal location .

the microarray design used in this study, contained probes for  <dig> vsgs,  <dig> atypical vsgs, and  <dig> vsgs that were unclassified on vsgdb  <cit> ;  <dig> sub-telomeric esags,  <dig> chromosome-internal esags and gresags, as well as  <dig> esags from three t. brucei strain  <dig> ess . this vsg and esag subset of genes was represented by a total of  <dig> probe-sets. even though individual parasites express only one es  at a time, since the parasites have been maintained without regard for antigenic type, we expected that there would be diverse set of vsg genes showing some expression at the population level. in addition, we expected that expression of these vsgs and esags would vary between biological replicates, and indeed, a subset of vsg and esags showed considerable variation in bf, but not pf , probably reflecting antigenic variation within these populations. thus, subsequent analyses were carried out on the  <dig> individual samples rather than on the mean of the biological conditions .

hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> probe-sets  allowed us to define four distinct patterns of vsg gene and esag expression . interestingly, the distribution of vsg genes and esags from different genomic locations within each group differed markedly . group a contained a large number  of vsgs not expressed in any sample, or only at low levels in some bf samples, exemplified by gene  <dig> in figure 6d. all these genes were located within sub-telomeric clusters and were likely not transcribed at any stages, except when translocated to the active expression site in small sub-populations of bfs. this group also included five esags from t. brucei  <dig> ess that presumably either reside in inactive expression sites or are not present in t. brucei  <dig> 

a second group  contained  <dig> vsg genes and  <dig> esags, which were expressed at substantially higher  levels in bf and generally low levels in pf. many of these showed variable expression levels in different biological replicates of the bf samples, indicative of expression from active ess in sub-populations of bf. this group contained vsg and vr genes from sub-telomeric clusters , as well as from chromosomal-internal locations . it also contained esags and gresags from the  <dig> es, sub-telomeric clusters and chromosomal-internal loci. of particular interest are several esag <dig> genes that are up-regulated only in stumpy bf . while this group of genes has many of the hallmarks of canonical vsg/esag expression from ess, it should be noted that in many cases their signal levels in pf were substantially above background; suggesting that the genes are actively transcribed in pf, but the mrnas are less stable than in bf.

unexpectedly, a group  of  <dig> sub-telomeric vsg and nine esag genes showed variable expression levels in both bf and pf. the function of these vsg genes is unclear, since they appear to encode both typical and atypical vsgs. in particular, one group of four tandemly-linked vsg genes from an allele-specific region of chromosome  <dig> showed highest expression in pf-log cells . group c contains both sub-telomeric and internal genes encoding esags  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  interestingly, several esag11-related genes and a vr are located in a tandem array on chromosome  <dig>  where they are interspersed with genes encoding hypothetical proteins. since the hypothetical proteins show very similar expression patterns to the adjacent esag11-related genes, at least some may simply represent 3' utrs of the neighboring genes. interestingly, this cluster is located between rrna and trna gene clusters, and would not be expected to be transcribed, since it appears to lack the modified chromatin found at typical rna polymerase ii transcription initiation sites  <cit> . the signal levels for all these genes is modest , and are lowest in stationary phase, suggesting that they may merely represent increased "background" transcription due their proximity to the actively transcribed rna genes. however, this does not rule out functionality of this set of putative genes.

the final group  of vsg and esag genes were expressed in all life cycle stages. all nine vsg/vr genes in this group are located in chromosomal-internal loci: four are annotated as vrs, four are atypical vsgs and one is uncategorized. mrna for several of the vr genes has previously been detected in pf using pcr  <cit> . one of the vrs shows highest expression in pf-stat . three of the atypical vsg genes show similar expression in all stages . these genes, tb <dig> . <dig>  tb <dig> . <dig> and tb <dig> . <dig>  along with a 4th gene identical to tb <dig> . <dig>  are tandemly-linked to form a small cluster just 5'  to the sub-telomeric vsg cluster at the "right" end of chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, this cluster of genes is immediately downstream of a convergent strand-switch region that appears to contain an rna polymerase transcription initiation site in both bf and pf  <cit> . a large number of esags are also expressed in all life cycle stages; of these most are chromosomal-internal gresag <dig> genes that have been shown previously to be expressed in pf  <cit> . however, two esag4s and an esag <dig> from the  <dig> es show this expression pattern, as do six sub-telomeric esags . the functional significance of their expression in pf is unknown.

of the  <dig> vsg genes examined,  <dig> showed expression levels above the bottom quartile  of all genes in at least one bf sample. these included  <dig> classified as encoding functional vsgs, and eight that were unclassified, but also included eight encoding atypical vsgs and  <dig> vrs. from these data it is apparent that at least some atypical vsgs are expressed and hence likely to be functional. indeed a query on genedb for vsgs annotated as being detected in proteomic analysis of bf  <cit>  yielded seven genes, two of which are atypical vsgs. only nine of the  <dig> vsg genes noted above were expressed below the 5th percentile  in pf. these included five encoding typical vsgs , but one gene encoded an atypical vsg, and one vr gene also had this expression pattern. thus, these data suggest that the functional diversity of vsg and vr genes is likely more complex that currently appreciated.

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in our study for genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in bf versus pf, including those used as controls in a previous microarray analysis  <cit> , allow us to critically assess the validity of our analysis. as expected, mrnas corresponding to pyruvate kinase  <dig>  metacaspase  <dig>  isoforms of isg <dig>  isg <dig>  and isg <dig>  vsg glycophosphatidyl inositol phospholipase, major surface protease msp  isoforms a and c, hexokinase i and phosphoglycerate kinase isoform c all showed increased levels in cbf; while ep <dig> and ep-3- <dig> procyclins, a trans-sialidase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, cysteine-rich acidic integral membrane protein , a flagellar adhesion protein, corset protein  <dig>  and cap <dig>   <cit>  all showed increased signal in pf-log samples, although the changes generally were less dramatic than those seen on northern blots and in the previous microarray analyses. seven genes previously used as differentially expressed controls in  <cit>  showed changes less than 2-fold in our hands. four showed more modest changes and one  did not change between cbf and pf-log, although it was down-regulated in pf-stat. finally, recent data suggest that two of those genes may not be regulated between these stages  <cit> . thus, there is good agreement between the current results and previous work. since eight probes were used for most genes in our study, it is likely that any changes we see are highly reliable. the somewhat muted differences could be due to a lower sensitivity of the microarrays or to strain variations  <cit> .

the data we obtained shows that despite the lack of transcriptional control for most genes, gene expression is finely tuned during t. brucei development. while most of changes in mrna abundance were relatively modest, some varied by 10- to 100-fold, and over one-fourth changed at least 2-fold between the different conditions. many of these changes were easy to reconcile with known changes in parasite biology: the transition from dividing to non-dividing forms affects genetic functions such as transcription and translation and the transition from mammalian to insect stages affects metabolism, surface proteins and transporters. a moderate number of genes encoding proteins with functions associated with rna were differentially expressed, perhaps reflecting the important role these play in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. it is perhaps surprising that relatively few genes encoding protein or lipid kinases and phosphatases were highly regulated, although this may reflect a predominant use of phosphorylation pathways to modulate the activities of these enzymes themselves.

a recently published set of analyses of the transcriptomes of the four developmental stages of trypanosoma cruzi indicated that up to 50% of genes show a statistically significant difference in mrna levels during parasite development  <cit> , a proportion considerably higher than that which we observed in t. brucei. it is likely that as other stages of the t. brucei life cycle are examined, the proportion of genes determined to show significant regulation during development will rise. our findings can also be compared to studies in related parasite leishmania where ~3-10% of the genes showed changes of at least 2-fold between rapidly-growing procyclic promastigotes, non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes, and the more slowly-growing amastigote forms  <cit> . while the studies in leishmania identified a heterogeneous, but overlapping, set of mrnas showing regulation in abundance, several similarities with the present study emerge. these include down-regulation of genes encoding translational machinery  in slower growing stages, as well as substantial changes in mrna levels for many metabolic enzymes.

interestingly, our results show very little difference between cultured and animal-derived t. brucei bf. other studies using stresses such as exposure to tunicamycin or reducing agents, reduced serum or genetic manipulation of specific genes showed few changes in rna abundances, suggesting that bf parasites have little ability to alter their transcriptome following unexpected environmental changes  <cit> . this contrasts with some reports of substantial differences between axenic and animal-derived amastigotes of leishmania  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether this difference is due to the extracellular nature of t. brucei, methodological difficulties of extracting amastigotes from macrophages, or novel environmental cues detected by the leishmania parasites.

use of the nimblegen arrays also allowed us to provide an assessment of the relative abundance of transcripts within a biological condition, over at least two orders of magnitude. while many of the highly expressed transcripts encode well-characterized proteins, there still remain many that have received little or no attention. the data presented here provide an important foundation for researchers interested in elucidating the unusual biology of the parasite or developing new interventions to combat the lethal disease they cause. it is now important to further understand the mechanisms involving regulation of translation, protein activity, and protein turnover to realize the full extent of developmental regulation in t. brucei. this is underscored by recent work comparing changes in the transcriptome and proteome during leishmania differentiation, which suggests that there is a relatively poor correlation between the two and that translation and protein stability play important roles in regulation of gene expression in trypanosomatids  <cit> . however, work in t. cruzi suggests a more robust relationship  <cit> , perhaps pointing to different modes of gene regulation between the leishmania and trypanosoma genera.
