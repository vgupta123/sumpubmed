BACKGROUND
many gram-positive bacteria produce anti-bacterial peptides and small proteins, called bacteriocins. there are three main classes produced by gram-positive lactic acid bacteria : class i bacteriocins are the lantibiotics, small , post-translationally modified peptides containing unusual amino acids such as lanthionine; class ii are small, unmodified, heat-stable bacteriocins ; class iii include larger  heat-labile proteins, such as murein hydrolases  <cit> . most bacteriocins are synthesized as precursors, which are matured and secreted, then target a specific bacterium and kill it by increasing its membrane permeability to various small molecules. class ii bacteriocins are subdivided into iia, pediocin-like unmodified bacteriocins, iib, two-peptide unmodified bacteriocins, iic, formerly class v, where the n- and c-termini are covalently linked resulting in a cyclic structure, and class iid, non-pediocin, single, linear peptides  <cit> . the genetics and biosynthesis of class iia bacteriocins have been well studied  <cit> , and these constitute one of the most important groups of antimicrobial peptides, due to their useful antibacterial properties. all known iia bacteriocins are described as being active against listeria and some have already been tested as food preservatives for controlling food-borne pathogens  <cit> . structurally, class iia bacteriocins are related to each other being unstructured in aqueous solution, but with a central amphiphilic alpha-helical region when in lipid micelles or tfe  <cit> ; they contain the characteristic conserved n-terminal ygngvxcxxxxc sequence, though usually not the gxxxg motif characteristic of iib and iic bacteriocins  <cit> .

the class iib two-peptide unmodified bacteriocins, for example plantaricin e/f  <cit> , need the complementary action of both peptides to be active  <cit> . these bacteriocins contain long amphiphilic alpha-helical stretches, and the two complementary peptides interact when exposed to membrane-like entities. the gxxxg motif is conserved in many two-peptide bacteriocins, and it is postulated that the two complementary peptides dimerize via a helix-helix interaction that involves this motif, to form the functionally active heterodimer  <cit> . the dimer functions by creating a pore within the membrane through which small molecules leak out, and, typically, the genes encoding the two peptides are found adjacent to each other on the same operon  <cit> .

the cyclic class iic bacteriocins are characterized by being tryptophan-rich and lacking any gg, gxxxg or ygngvxcxxxxc motifs,  <cit> ; the class iid bacteriocins have none of these features but some have recently been found also to be circular, rather than linear, with conserved axxhhn and ahhw/f motifs  <cit> .

in order to neutralize the toxic effect of the peptide on the "producing" cell the genes encoding bacteriocins are generally co-transcribed with a cognate immunity protein. these small proteins  interact very tightly with a specific bacteriocin or pair of bacteriocins and protect the "producing" microbe from the toxic effect of its own bacteriocin  <cit> . the immunity proteins usually show high specificity for their cognate bacteriocins  <cit> . for each class iia bacteriocin encoded in a genome there is a one to one relationship between bacteriocin and cognate immunity protein; whereas, in contrast, for each pair of class iib two-peptide bacteriocins there is a single cognate immunity protein encoded in a genome  <cit> . structures of five immunity proteins have already been solved: imb <dig>  <cit> , enta-im  <cit> , pedb  <cit> , pisi  <cit> , and mun-im  <cit> , all protective against iia bacteriocins. as yet, no structures for immunity proteins protective against iib or iic bacteriocins have been solved.

the sequencing of bacterial genomes, including those from human pathogens, has revealed a number of genes which might potentially code for new bacteriocins and immunity proteins, suggesting that the use of these antimicrobial peptides is more widespread than previously thought and that bacteria might be targeting several different bacterial species using these toxins. understanding which specific immunity protein neutralizes which bacteriocin toxin is important if these peptides are to be used as antimicrobials.

the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, closely related to lab, is one of the most common human pathogens. it causes a wide range of both minor diseases such as pharyngitis, erysipelas and pyodermas, that are readily controlled by antibiotics, as well as major, often lethal, conditions such as acute rheumatic fever, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, in developing countries and in the western world  <cit> . the search for new antibacterial agents effective against this species is thus urgent.

other streptococcal species have been shown to secrete bacteriocin-like toxins, as there are reports of s. salivarius producing a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances showing in vitro inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes, including salivaricin a  <cit> . such observations suggest that antibacterial toxins are playing a very important role in controlling the level of the s. pyogenes population in human microbiomes. bacteriocin-like toxins and antitoxins may well have an impact on the development of new antibacterial strategies and treatments. a thorough understanding of the biology of the bacteriocins in combination with their immunity proteins is important for any possible therapeutic use of bacteriocins. the full sequences of lab genomes provide opportunities to scan for the presence of toxins and their corresponding immunity proteins. however, the sequence alone may not be sufficient to identify these proteins.

here we present the first structure of the protein from locus spy_ <dig> , named pyogenecin immunity protein sp-pip, determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. we provide structural and sequence analyses, and identify the putative corresponding bacteriocin-like toxins in the s. pyogenes genome, which are found to belong to the class iib two-peptide bacteriocins.

RESULTS
structure determination
we have expressed the pyogenecin immunity protein from s. pyogenes in escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity. the crystal structure of sp-pip was solved by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction  method using selenomethionine -substituted protein. the model was refined to  <dig>  Å with an r-factor of  <dig> % and an r-free of  <dig> %. the crystal asymmetric unit contains  <dig>  well ordered residues and  <dig> water molecules. the first methionine and the  <dig> c-terminal residues are disordered and cannot be identified in the electron density maps. the structure is high quality; all non-glycine and non-proline residues of the model lie either in the most favorable region  or in the additionally allowed region  of the ramachandran plot. detailed refinement statistics and crystallographic data are shown in table  <dig>  the crystal structure of sp-pip, shown in figure  <dig>  is a typical anti-parallel four-helix bundle. the four long helices  pack tightly together around a well-defined hydrophobic core. one additional short helix  connects helices h <dig> and h <dig>  all long helices are between  <dig> and  <dig> residues in length. helix-pairs h1/h <dig> and h2/h <dig> are parallel to each other and helix-pairs h1/h <dig> and h3/h <dig> cross over each other at an angle of approximately 30°. in the structure, the n- and c-termini are very close together . overall, the protein is slightly acidic  with two large acidic patches near each end of the bundle and one large positively charged patch near the n- and c-termini.

structural analysis
structural comparisons, using the dali server  <cit> , reveal that the structure of sp-pip matches a range of proteins all having a four helix bundle topology, with a z-score of  <dig>  or less. in this range of z-scores, it is not clear whether the matches are due to homology or simply to structural similarity. however, structural homology combined with sequence analysis, enabled us to relate this protein to structures that ranked 2nd , 10th  and 23rd  in the list of dali matches, and the results are shown in table  <dig>  these homologous proteins are all pediocin-like immunity proteins. sp-pip shares a rmsd of  <dig>  Å with imb <dig>  1tdp, over  <dig> residues, and, using the structure comparison service ssm at european bioinformatics institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm <cit> , the rmsd is found to be  <dig>  Å.

sequence analysis
guided by the structure of sp-pip, whose sequence had not been assigned to any known protein family, we sought to expand our knowledge of its sequence relatives using the pfam database  <cit> . having identified that it was structurally similar to known members of the pfam enta_immun family  we carried out an analysis with profile hidden markov models  to determine whether sp-pip should also belong to this family or not. taking the enta_immun family from pfam release  <dig>  as a starting point we carried out iterative searches using the hmmer package . after multiple rounds of searching of the hmm against the sequence database  using an e-value threshold of  <dig>  along with careful manual inspection of the resulting matches we were able to detect  <dig> sequences compared to the  <dig> sequences found in pfam release  <dig> . the family has been updated in the current release of pfam -  <dig>  - and the alignment is now available on the pfam web-site at: http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk//family/pf <dig> 

domain analysis
we investigated whether any other protein domains were to be found on any immunity proteins in the enta_immun family. some members of the family do also carry associated domains. one protein contains an n-terminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator , and a group of methionine sulfoxide reductases from enterococcus faecium  and closely related species carry a c-terminal pmsr domain - peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase  - as well as the n-terminal immunity protein domain.

proteome analysis
sp-pip belongs to a large family of putative bacteriocin immunity proteins. to investigate the possible targets of the presumed immunity protein we carried out an analysis of the proteomes of several strains of s. pyogenes, including m <dig> gas, mgas <dig>  and mgas <dig>  to try to identify any complementary bacteriocins and immunity proteins. we searched the proteomes with hmms of both the known class i, antibacterial <dig> , and class ii bacteriocins, bacteriocin_ii , bacteriocin_iic  as well as with the enta_immun families, from the pfam database . we have identified a small genomic region containing four genes encoding putative bacteriocin proteins of class iib , and have called the proteins pyogenecin  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the organization of this region is shown in figure 2a. we have also identified two separate gene loci encoding immunity proteins in the s. pyogenes genome: spy_ <dig>  and spy_ <dig>  both encoded proteins were found in all the s. pyogenes strains examined, and are identified as belonging to the enta_immun family , a family which contains nearly  <dig> different members from lab and closely related species.

discussion
the four-helix bundle structure of sp-pip was found to be most closely related to those of a number of pediocin-like iia immunity proteins. three subgroups of pediocin-like iia immunity proteins have been defined on the basis of common sequence motifs and phylogenetic analysis  <cit> , being denoted as groups a, b and c, as shown in figure 3:

• group a: enta-im, the enterocin a immunity protein,  <cit> ; pdb id:2bl8

• group b: pisi, the piscicolin  <dig> immunity protein  <cit> ; pdb id: 2k19

• group c: imb <dig>  the carnobacteriocin b <dig> immunity protein  <cit> ; pdb id:1tdp

the structural comparison results suggest that sp-pip is most closely related to imb <dig>  from subgroup c. these results suggest that sp-pip is highly likely to function as a bacteriocin immunity protein with similarities to proteins from group c.

sequence analysis reveals that sp-pip belongs to the now expanded pfam family of immunity proteins enta_immun that also includes pediocin-like immunity proteins from groups a, b and c as detailed above, thus confirming its evolutionary link to known bacteriocin immunity proteins. a search for other immunity proteins of a similar nature in the s. pyogenes genome identified another gene locus encoding a protein matching the enta_immun family. both of these loci were seen in all strains examined. unlike the case in many other species, in s. pyogenes these bacteriocin immunity proteins were not found closely linked to their bacteriocins, a condition that might be explained by the remnants of a transposon identified between them.

functions for proteins may often be inferred through consideration of the combinations of the functional domains found on them. a number of domain-pairings were identified on some of the immunity family members, such as an n-terminal helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator on one protein, which might be suggestive of immunity proteins acting as transcriptional regulators or of interacting with transcription regulators and modulating their function. a group of methionine sulfoxide reductases are found to carry both a c-terminal pmsr domain and the immunity domain. the pmsr domain is involved in reversing protein inactivation by oxidation of methionine residues. however, it is not clear what, if any, functional significance these domain-pairings might have.

the search for potential bacteriocin targets for this putative immunity protein took in classes i, ii and iii. our analyses identified that s. pyogenes contains a class i lantibiotic system composed of one unique lantibiotic type a sequence called srta and just one unique immunity protein srti. these two genes are closely associated on the genome, but are separated from the proteins of the class ii system described below as well as from the presumed immunity proteins. this suggests that the sp-pip is unlikely to act as an immunity protein for class i bacteriocins. class ii bacteriocins are subdivided into classes iia, iib, iic and iid. we did not find any bacteriocins of class iia encoded by the s. pyogenes genome, which would have the well-conserved n-terminal ygngvxcxxxc motif  <cit> . searches were not made for bacteriocins of types iic or iid since the immunity proteins complementary for these two groups identified so far, gassericin a  <cit>  and circularin a,  <cit>  do not share sequence or size similarity with those of the pediocin-like immunity proteins. the four putative class iib proteins we identified from a short genomic region, and named pyogenecins 1- <dig>  are found as two tandem pairs of genes separated by a gene in the antisense orientation that encodes a transposase pseudogene. the presence of this pseudogene suggests that this region might once have been part of a mobile genetic element. finding bacteriocins in pairs is characteristic of the class iib bacteriocins  <cit> . as with other class iib bacteriocins, these pyogenecins have a conserved gg leader peptide, as well as the conserved gxxxg motif necessary for helix-helix interaction between the two proteins, as illustrated in figure 2b. all four putative pyogenecins are found to fall into the pfam bacteriocin_iic family , a family of bacteriocins secreted by streptococcal and other lab species.

based on the sequence similarity to other two-peptide bacteriocins, the genomic arrangement of the genes found, and the identification of two immunity proteins, we hypothesize that the putative pyogenecins  <dig> and  <dig> associate to form one active bacteriocin and pyogenecins  <dig> and  <dig> associate to form a second active bacteriocin possibly targeting a different bacterial species. these peptides need now to be synthesized to allow testing of their biological activity in a suitable bacteriocin-assay. given that we find two immunity proteins we suggest that each one is specific for one of the putative bacteriocin pairs, pyogenecin1/pyogenecin <dig> and pyogenecin3/pyogenecin <dig> 

there is also the possibility that one or both of these immunity proteins might be an orphan immunity protein  <cit> , so-called because no cognate bacteriocin in the genome has been identified; and it has been pointed out that most other immunity proteins so far determined for iia two-peptide bacteriocins are small trans-membrane proteins closely coupled transcriptionally with their bacteriocins  <cit> . however, it would appear that the sequences of only a handful of two-peptide immunity proteins have been deduced and neither are there defined structures for any of these nor are most of them more than putative immunity proteins, the designation being based only on the presence of predicted transmembrane helices  <cit> , so comparison with the system we propose here is difficult. the exact method by which immunity proteins protect their host cell or interact with the bacteriocins is also unclear, but it may be that the orphan immunity proteins do confer resistance to other bacteriocins in addition to their cognate bacteriocin  <cit> . it is possible of course that many more two-peptide-like systems remain still to be characterized, as there are a large number of additional lab peptides in the pfam family bacteriocin_iic pf <dig> which are "pairs" in the sense that they are expressed from closely adjacent genes and for which a cognate immunity protein has not yet been identified.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the putative immunity protein sp-pip protective against potential class iib two-peptide bacteriocins could be the first structural representative of this class. a combined structural, genomic and proteomic analyses has allowed the identification and in silico characterization of a new putative immunity protein from s. pyogenes. structurally similar proteins seem to provide immunity protection for single peptide iia class bacteriocins. further biological and biochemical studies are needed to verify the antibacterial activity of the putative pyogenecins and to determine the degree of resistance and cross-resistance provided by the proposed immunity protein.
