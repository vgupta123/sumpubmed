BACKGROUND
the collapse of the late bronze age societies of the eastern mediterranean  led to a cascade of initial demographic retrenchment then expansion, particularly among the phoenicians of the coastal levant and the greeks of the aegean sea  <cit> . both the greeks and phoenicians established a set of partitioned colonies along the coast of mediterranean europe and north africa and engaged in extensive trade of a variety of goods including tin and other minerals, wine and olive oil  <cit> . the greeks, at the beginning of the 1st millennium bce founded cities along the asia minor  coast, divided into the aeolian cities of northwest anatolia, the ionian cities of central western anatolia and the dorian cities of southwest anatolia  <cit> . although the greek colonies of magna graecia of southern italy and sicily were established from a mixture of predominantly dorian cities of the aegean, the peloponnesus and central greece, the historical attestation of the greek colonization of the western mediterranean coastal regions of provence, spain and corsica indicates a dominant influence from the ionian city of phokaia    <cit> . the phokaian greeks founded the city of massalia circa  <dig> bce at the location of the present city of marseille and alalie circa  <dig> bce on the eastern coast of corsica  <cit> . here the phokaians encountered and interacted with the indigenous celto-ligurian populations, as evidenced by large caches of wine amphora, which the local tribes distributed along the rhone river and the mediterranean coast  <cit> .

few genetic studies have explored the greek contribution to the modern populations of italy and france. a recent study of y-chromosome haplogroups in a sicilian population  <cit>  showed a major impact of presumptive greek immigration to the island estimated by admixture analysis to be about 37% using a localized balkan/greek marker e-v <dig>  this level of admixture was higher than that predicted by classical demographic studies. previous y-chromosome genetic studies of phoenician colonization have demonstrated that haplogroup j <dig> frequency was amplified in regions containing the phoenician colonies of iberia and north africa in comparison to areas not containing phoenician colonies  <cit> . however, these studies did not address the role of either greek colonization or early neolithic colonization of western europe.

y-chromosome studies have investigated the contribution of various y haplogroups to the spread of farming from the near east to europe  <cit> . haplogroup j <dig> frequency has been correlated with aspects of the symbolic material culture of the neolithic in europe and the near east   <cit>  and sub-haplogroups of j <dig> have also been associated with the neolithic colonization of mainland greece, crete and southern italy  <cit> . on the other hand, e-v <dig> appears to have originated in greece or the southern balkans  <cit>  and then spread to sicily at high frequencies with the greek colonization of the island. e-v <dig> is also found at low frequencies on the anatolian mainland  <cit>  and thus may be useful in teasing apart the relative contributions of greek colonization  from early neolithic colonization  to western europe. in this report, a sampling of individuals whose ancestry traces to the ionian greek city of phokaia will be compared through y-chromosome genotyping to samples from the aeolian/ionian city of smyrna and a set of samples from provence. these data will reveal genetic patterning characteristic of 1) the ionian foundation of phokaia versus the aeolian/ionian foundation of smyrna. 2) the relative y chromosome contributions of phokaian greeks and local anatolian/neolithic and/or central anatolian populations in these two asia minor greek city-states and 3) the contribution of greek and/or neolithic y-chromosomes to the demographic pattern of provence.

RESULTS
the phylogenetic relationships and haplogroup frequencies for the data from the two sites in asia minor: phokaia and smyrna, three mainland greek sites, the four regions from turkey and the neolithic sites in provence are given in figure  <dig>  phokaia and smyrna have just subtle differences in their haplogroup composition. the dominant haplogroups in both phokaia and smyrna are e-v <dig>  and r1b-m <dig>  respectfully. in addition, j2a is also common, attaining a frequency of  <dig> % in phokaia and  <dig> % in smyrna. this high frequency of haplogroup j2a-page <dig>  in smyrna is characteristic of non-greek anatolia. table  <dig> describes populations analyzed in this study. the amova  showed no significant distinction between phokaia and smyrna, whereas smyrna was significantly differentiated from central anatolia and phokaia from western anatolia. smyrna also differed from both the sesklo/dimini samples from thessaly and the lerna/franchthi cave samples from the peloponnese. the amova analysis demonstrated that both language/religion and geography discriminated the sample groups .

mds analyses show that both mainland greek and phokaia separate from the turkish samples while smyrna positions between mainland greeks and the turks . since the phokaian and smyrnian samples could not be distinguished from each other in terms of fst, they were aggregated for the subsequent admixture analyses.

the dominant haplogroup of provence is r1b-m <dig> at  <dig> % . also found in provence is haplogroup e-v <dig>  and j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> . all the v <dig> derived samples are from western provence along the rhone, while all the j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> are from var in eastern provence.

the admixture analysis  indicates a high level of indigenous basque admixture throughout provence . also detected is a 17% contribution of greek phokaia/smyrna and a 0% neolithic  contribution to the neolithic sites and surname based provence samples. investigating the apportionment of the pooled data from neolithic sites and surname based into eastern provence  and western provence  the data showed a 12% greek component and an 18% neolithic component to eastern provence, while attesting a 19% greek component and a 0% neolithic component to western provence. this does not exclude other sources of early neolithic demographic episodes to provence such as the radiation of r1b- <dig> sub lineages  <cit> . of the  <dig> y-chromosomes studied in corsica  <dig> % were derived at e-v <dig> in east corsica and  <dig> % in west corsica. the network plot of eight v <dig> ystrs for provence, corsica, smyrna and phokaia  showed haplotype sharing among the e-v <dig> representatives. coalescent times for e-v <dig> in corsica, greek anatolia and provence are presented in additional file 2: supplemental table s <dig>  the mean ages are oldest in greek anatolia consistent with it being a source population. the values should be viewed as upper bounds. the ages for corsica and provence exceed the founding dates from the archeological record of the greek colonies in the mediterranean. this discordance is most likely a consequence of multiple e-v <dig> founders inflating the variance.

discussion
this study presents the first genetic data on those greeks whose ancestry traces to western anatolia before the  <dig> exchange with turkey. the two sites: phokaia and smyrna have a long established historical record and represent somewhat different archaic greek dialects and regions. archaic smyrna, a small polis of approximately  <dig> hectares in size, perhaps containing  <dig> individuals, was initially aeolic with a subsequent immigration of ionic greeks from nearby kolophon  <cit> . phokaia was a larger ionic city-state , containing an estimated  <dig> individuals including its surrounding chora, its agricultural territory  <cit> . smyrna, on the other hand, being a smaller polis, may show evidence of indigenous anatolian admixture likely from neighbouring lydia  <cit>  with higher frequencies of j2a-page <dig> derived chromosomes.

the frequency of j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> in phokaia  is comparable to that of central anatolia . interestingly, the anatolian greek samples derived for j2a with dys <dig> =  <dig> have dys <dig> =  <dig> repeats, while samples from central anatolia and antalya in mediterranean anatolia and crete, either are equally mixed with dys <dig> = 9/ <dig> or dominated by j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> with dys <dig> =  <dig> or more repeats. the similar frequencies of j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> in the greek city-state and anatolia make the marker less useful for detecting a pure neolithic component in other regions; however, the separation by dys <dig> offers some utility in teasing apart the relevant components.

in france, massalia was the unique initial greek colony founded by the phokaians circa  <dig> bce  <cit> . the initial colony was small, likely  <dig> hectares in area, but rapidly expanded during the following century to  <dig> hectares  <cit> . thus, its initial population may have numbered  <dig> to  <dig> rapidly growing to  <dig> people including its small hinterland chora, later cultivated in large part with vineyards. in contrast, the departments of var, vaucluse and bouche-du-rhone contain an area of  <dig>  square kilometers. during the roman period, according to beloch  <cit>  who estimates a density of  <dig> individuals per square km in northern italy, the population might have numbered  <dig> . even with an earlier  <dig> bce reduction in population density around massalia, it is probable that the indigenous ligurians may have numbered at least  <dig> . this would have yielded a maximum of 10% greek input to provence, much lower than the estimated 20% y-chromosome input. however, this increase in y-chromosome admixture from greece is in accord with the recent results from sicily, which estimated a 37% greece input, in accordance with the demographic estimate of  <cit> . we acknowledge that population history of provence has been influenced by additional demographic events besides the neolithic and greek colonization events. one potential confound is the impact of the roman empire. however in other regions well known to have been settled by romans, e.g. england, southern spain, morocco and sardinia, the frequency of e-v <dig> ranges from zero to 1%  <cit> . the impact of phoenicians is minimal since the frequency of e-v <dig> in lebanon is zero out of  <dig> samples . thus the presence of e-v <dig> in the western mediterranean is most likely driven by greek colonists. interestingly the female input, estimated using mtdna data may be minimal in provence. one mtdna study of var, showed a negligible neolithic  component to the mtdna distribution of var  <cit> . results from a single locus like the y chromosome phylogeny must be interpreted cautiously since haplogroup designation and population are not absolutely equivalent. in addition founder effects, sex-biased reproduction, sexual selection can skew the interpretation of a population's history.

the greeks of massalia, between  <dig> bce and  <dig> bce, conquered a vast nearby area and set up satellite trading posts, settlements and forts. these sites included monoikos , nikaia , antipolis , olbia and tauroeis  <cit> . the greeks from massalia also engaged in a major trading network along the mediterranean coast and up the rhone evidenced by massaliote wine amphora and other ceramics  <cit> . our data are consistent with a male-mediated asymmetric gene flow into the indigenous celto-ligurian populations of iron age provence due to possibly differential mating practices, elite dominance or enslavement.

the island of corsica contains e-v <dig> y-chromosomes, particularly in the eastern portion of the island at a frequency of  <dig> %. eastern corsica was the site of a major phokaian colony, alalie, and the e-v <dig> network pattern suggests overlap among the regions studied. on the other hand, using j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig>  g-m <dig> and j2a-m <dig>  we detected a neolithic , impact on the demography of east provence. this may be a slight overestimate, since no j2a-m <dig> or g-m <dig> derived chromosomes were found in the provence samples. that said, the predominant region in which j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> lineages are present is var, situated near initial neolithic impressed ware sites  <cit> . west of var, j2a-dys <dig> =  <dig> frequency drops off precipitously suggesting the demographic impact of neolithic colonists from anatolia does exceed beyond this region. the western districts of vaucluse and bouches du rhônes contains mesolithic sites and later cardial neolithic package  <cit> . the high level of indigenous basque admixture in provence is consistent of a model of the cultural diffusion of agriculture. the lack of y-chromosome neolithic markers in west provence suggests that the subsequent cardial neolithic may reflect a cultural adoption of farming in this area.

CONCLUSIONS
the greeks from both mainland greece and anatolia made a major contribution to the development of western european culture through their mediterranean colonies  during the iron age. haplogroup e-v <dig> may trace the movement of the ionian greeks to key areas of france and corsica that introduced viniculture to western europe  <cit> . further studies will help elucidate the relative contribution of the greek and neolithic migrations in other areas of the western mediterranean.
