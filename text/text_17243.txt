BACKGROUND
there is currently an upsurge of interest in the search for renewable biomass to produce liquid transportation fuels such as bioethanol. this interest has been resulted from environmental concerns about toxic-gas emissions from burning petroleum fuels as well as a decrease in the available petroleum resources and fossil fuels. increased attention has been paid on bioethanol as a promising alternative energy source  <cit> . bioethanol is the most important biofuel today, which accounts for more than 90 % of total biofuel use  <cit> .

increasing attention is paid on ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials, especially low-cost waste materials  <cit> , due to the abundance of lignocellulosic materials among the renewable resources. fr is an industrial byproduct from corncobs-based furfural production  <cit> . furfural production process involves treating corncobs under heated and acidic conditions   <cit> . the resultant fr is composed mainly of cellulose and lignin  <cit> . cellulose and lignin in the cobs are relatively stable under furfural production conditions. therefore, fr could be a great candidate material for ethanol production after pretreatment. utilization of fr to produce ethanol would be effective in the dispose of waste products, while reducing environmental pollution.

it has been previously reported that the presence of lignin in biomass substrates might inhibit enzymatic hydrolysis  <cit> , as the interaction between the lignin and the enzyme would reduce the activity of cellulase. the conversion of fermentable sugars is a crucial process for bioethanol production  <cit> . therefore, biomass delignification is an efficient approach for ethanol production to increase the available surface area of cellulose, dissolve the lignin, and break the bonds between lignin and carbohydrate polymers, and finally dissolve the lignin. as for fr, alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment could effectively degrade the acidic lignin  <cit> .

green liquor , which is an alkaline mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide, can be used in alkaline pretreatment, and it has recently been developed for biomass applications  <cit> . this method could selectively remove lignin and recover cellulose efficiently  <cit> . the previous study showed that there was  <dig>  % lignin removal ratio using alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment  <cit> . in the present study, gl and hydrogen peroxide  were combined as a pretreatment for fr delignification with the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , which is a heavy metal ion chelate effective in reducing h2o <dig> degradation  <cit> .

cassava residues  are dry solid fibrous byproducts of the starch industry  <cit> , with an annual production of approximately  <dig> thousand tons in china  <cit> . cr is composed of starch , cellulose , and hemicellulose   <cit> . due to the low cellulose content and high starch content, cr might be considered as a cellulosic starch byproduct  <cit>  that could be easily processed using starch ethanol techniques into several valuable products. in addition, cr contains a certain amount of protein, which could provide the necessary nutrients for yeast fermentation. however, low ethanol yields have been reported with cr due to the poor accessibility of the cr slurry to cellulolytic enzymes  <cit> . it is more advantageous to combine cr with lignocellulosic material for use in ethanol production  <cit> .

with a high ethanol concentration in the fermentation broth, the energy consumption of distillation could be reduced. a higher sugar concentration can be achieved by using a higher substrate concentration during the process of lignocellulose enzymatic hydrolisis. however, this can also lead to a higher concentration of inhibitors and when the whole slurry is used it may lead to a decreased yield as a result of inhibition such as by glycerol and due to poor mass transfer  <cit> . recently, methods have been developed for efficient hydrolysis and fermentation of mixed fermentative microorganisms  <cit> . erdei et al.  <cit>  developed a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  process for wheat straw and wheat meal and illustrated that ssf of these mixed substrates could enhance ethanol production. using substrate mixtures is promising to increase final ethanol concentrations and to replace starch with lignocelluloses. one possibility to produce a high final yield in ssf of mixtures is the dilution of inhibitors. brandberg et al.  <cit>  showed that starch hydrolysates are potential supplements for ethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. in the present work, the ssf of fr, which was subjected to gl-h2o <dig> pretreatment , and cr, were carried out. the final ethanol concentration, yield, concentrations of byproducts, number of live yeast cells, and the dead yeast ratio were compared.

RESULTS
effects of h2o <dig> concentration on the chemical composition of pretreated fr
untreated fr contained  <dig>  % cellulose,  <dig>  % acid insoluble lignin, and  <dig>  % ash. the lignin content was higher than that of yu et al.  <cit>  because of the different batches of fr from factory. cellulose and lignin are the main components, accounting production step with the addition of acid  <cit> . fr was pretreated with various concentrations of h2o <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  with 9 ml gl/g-dry substrate for 3 h at 80 °c and ph  <dig> . after the gl-h2o <dig> pretreatment, the solid yield was reduced with increasing amounts of h2o <dig> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . likewise, the content of lignin decreased . approximately  <dig>  % of the lignin was removed using  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate, whereas  <dig>  % was removed using  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate. unlike the lignin,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of cellulose recovery were obtained from the substrate pretreated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate, respectively . alkaline solutions have classically been used to bleach wood pulp  <cit> , and the pretreatment’s efficacy due to alkali hydrogen peroxide is higher than alkaline alone for fr pretreatment  <cit> . under these conditions, lignin would be decomposed to a low molecular weight and soluble oxidation product. in addition, fe2+ present in the gl could react with hydrogen peroxide. in order to reduce the degradation of h2o <dig>  edta was added in the pretreatment to form a complex with fe2+. the pretreatment conditions were relatively mild for fr cellulose, with the mentioned sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide content, thus the cellulose was not significantly degraded during the gl-h2o <dig> pretreatment.fig.  <dig> the effects of hydrogen peroxide concentration on the chemical composition of gl-h2o <dig> pretreated fr. raw material represents untreated fr, while  <dig>  g/g h2o <dig> represents fr pretreated with high loading of  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate and 9 ml gl/g-substrate at 80 °c and  <dig>  g/g h2o <dig> represents fr pretreated with high loading of  <dig>  g h2o2/g-substrate and 9 ml gl/g-substrate at 80 °c



ethanol and glucose concentrations during ssf with various mixture ratios of pretreated fr and cr
the composition of gl-h2o2-pretreated fr is shown in fig.  <dig>  and cr contains  <dig>  % starch,  <dig>  % cellulose,  <dig>  % protein, and  <dig>  % acid insoluble lignin. the gl-h2o2-pretreated fr with two levels of h2o <dig> treatments was used for ssf in five different ratios with 12 % substrate loading. figure  <dig> shows the concentrations of glucose and ethanol as a function of time during ssf. different ratios of gl-h2o2-pretreated fr and cr exhibited similar trends for glucose release, but there was a gradual decline of glucose level with an increase in gl-h2o2-pretreated fr to cr ratios . as shown in fig.  <dig>  higher amounts of glucose were obtained at each sampling point for cr mixtures with gl-h2o2-pretreated fr with higher peroxide content  compared with mixtures of gl-h2o2-pretreated fr with lower peroxide content . however, glucose was almost completely consumed within 24 h, under the various conditions of ssf .fig.  <dig> concentrations of ethanol  and glucose  during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of pretreated furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different mixture ratios with 12 % substrate loading at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr



the mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr reached a concentration of over 30 g/l of ethanol in all five groups.  <dig>  g/l of ethanol concentration was obtained using a 1: <dig> ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr , which corresponds to an ethanol yield of approximately  <dig>  % of the theoretical yield . both ethanol concentration and yield decreased with increasing amounts of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr. a concentration of  <dig>  g/l of ethanol was achieved when the ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr was increased to 5: <dig> , and the ethanol yield was  <dig>  % of the theoretical yield . a significant increase in both ethanol concentration and yield occurred with the addition of cr. as mentioned above, cr contains  <dig>  % protein and can act as a source of nitrogen, which is a necessary nutrient for ethanol production. decreasing lignin had a positive impact on ethanol production in the experiment . this is potentially the result of decreasing the adsorbed effect of lignin on cellulase.fig.  <dig> ethanol yield of the theoretical during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of pretreated furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different mixture ratios with 12 % substrate loading at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr



as shown in fig. 2b, more than 25 g/l of ethanol was obtained using a mixture of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, and the highest ethanol concentration was  <dig>  g/l with an ethanol yield of  <dig>  % of the theoretical yield when the ratio was 1: <dig> . the lowest ethanol concentration occurred at a mixture ratio of 5: <dig> with an ethanol concentration of  <dig>  g/l and an ethanol yield of  <dig>  % of the theoretical yield.

there were similar results for ethanol concentration in ssf when the ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr was 5: <dig> and the  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr ratio was 3: <dig> . for untreated fr, the ethanol concentration could reach the similar level under the fr:cr ratio of 1: <dig>  . gl-h2o <dig> pretreatment has a positive impact on fr, as the proportion of fr in ssf of the cr and fr mixture was enhanced after pretreatment with gl-h2o <dig> compared with untreated fr  <cit> . thus, decreasing the content of lignin within fr using gl-h2o <dig> pretreatment improved the material usage. cr promotes fr by providing important nutrients for fermentative organisms, and in turn when ssf is performed with the substrate of fr as well as cr, it is necessary to add cellulase, and they hydrolyse the cellulosic fraction in cr for additional ethanol. tang et al.  <cit>  showed that ssf of fr alone with mineral-salt medium  exhibited ethanol yield lower than that with organic medium, and also lower than that of mixture substrates with corn kernels. the organic nutrients were crucial for ssf of fr.

table  <dig> shows the results of batch fermentations that are conducted at a pilot scale. the initial ethanol production was  <dig>  g⋅l−1⋅h− <dig> when the ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr was 1: <dig>  which decreased to  <dig>  g⋅l−1⋅h− <dig> with a ratio of 5: <dig>  in the initial phase of fermentation, the production rate of ethanol from  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr was higher than that from  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr. however, the ethanol production rate after 120 h of ssf showed the opposite trend. there could be more inhibitors released in the initial phase of ssf for  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr than for  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr. the addition of cr appeared to attenuate this effect. this was likely due to the dilution of the lignocellulosic stream, resulting in a lower concentration of inhibitors  <cit> . similar result has been reported previously  <cit> . the ethanol concentration was  <dig>  g/l and the ethanol yield was  <dig>  % of the theoretical yield with untreated fr plus cr at a ratio of 1: <dig>  the similar concentrations and lower ethanol yields with increasing amounts of fr were indicative of lignin inhibition of ethanol production  <cit> .table  <dig> the effects of substrate mixture ratios on final ethanol yield  and the initial rates of products before 4 h



byproducts in ssf of different mixture ratios of pretreated fr and cr
raw material costs are themselves considerable , and utilization of available biomass is important  <cit> . pretreated fr  was combined with cr at various ratios, and the ssf efficiencies were measured and compared with each other. figure 4a illustrates the byproducts produced by ssf carried out with mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, and fig. 4b is that of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr in combination with cr. the investigated concentration range of these chemicals was chosen to examine possible applications involving concentrated slurries.fig.  <dig> concentrations of byproducts during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of pretreated furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different mixture ratios with 12 % substrate concentration at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> represent the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> represent the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr



glycerol
in sample a , the highest glycerol concentration  was formed at 120 h with a ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr of 5: <dig>  while in sample b it reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l with the same ratio . glycerol acts as an inhibitor of ssf as it consumes at least 4 % of the carbon source for the fermentation  <cit> . there was a high concentration of glycerol at 24 h, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g/l, with an increase of the mixture substrate ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr from 1: <dig> to 5: <dig> ; however, it ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g/l for the mixture of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr . a decrease in glycerol concentration occurred at 48 h, which is likely the result of the conversion of glycerol into dihydroxyacetone  <cit> . when half pretreated fr  and half cr was used in a mixture, the highest glycerol concentrations were  <dig>  to  <dig>  g/l, while  <dig>  g/l was reached using untreated fr plus cr with the same ratio . these results indicate that delignification of the source material used for ssf could produce less glycerol byproducts under the same conditions. in addition, glycerol would be against the osmotic pressure and would reduce the oxidation-reduction potential  <cit> , which would result in the concentration fluctuation . yeast cells lack acetaldehyde as a hydrogen acceptor, which leads to increased nadh as concentration is increased. nad+ required for xylitol dehydrogenase , can be regenerated by reducing dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol  <cit> .

lactic acid 
the increase in the production of la would accompany a decrease in the final ethanol concentration  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that little la was produced during the first 8 h for both levels of h2o <dig> pretreated fr. for mixtures containing a ratio of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr to cr of 1: <dig>  la production occurred after 24 h. the production of la was delayed in  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr compared with  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr. this could be due to the high delignification that occurred with  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr leading to a lower concentration of la  <cit> . the overall trend of the la concentration was increasing with increasing proportion of pretreated fr. however, the final la concentration for the mixture ratios of 2: <dig> and 1: <dig> were quite similar. the reduced la concentration was observed when more cr was used in the substrate mixture. besides that, the absence of la with increased pretreatment of fr indicates that the degraded lignin in the pretreatment liquid inhibit la bacteria  <cit> . moreover, increased concentrations of cr provide more nutrients, which decrease the production of la in both cases  <cit> .

acetic acid
in ssf of mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, the acetic acid concentration at 24 h was  <dig>  g/l,  <dig>  g/l, and  <dig>  g/l for mixture have a ratio of 3: <dig>  4: <dig>  and 5: <dig>  respectively . however, in ssf with mixture having a ratio of 1: <dig> or 2: <dig>  there was no acetic acid production prior to 24 h. on the other hand,  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr mixtures with cr incurred higher concentrations of acetic acid . the addition of cr delayed the production of acetic acid; at 48 h, for mixtures with ratio of 1: <dig> and 2: <dig>  the acetic acid concentration was  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l, respectively. acetic acid concentrations more than 2 g/l would reduce ethanolic fermentation  <cit> . the acetic acid concentration of the mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr was twice that of the mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, indicating that fr delignification has a positive effect on lowering acetic acid production. the formation of acetic acid is a kind of metabolism emanation  <cit> . hanmilton considered that the inhibition of acetic acid growth was not only the release of proton but also the accumulation of the anion. the inhibition of acetic acid formation was the comprehensive results  <cit> .

the initial rate of byproduct production in ssf is shown in table  <dig>  both the concentration and initial production rate of glycerol and acetic acid were increased with increasing addition of pretreated fr or by reducing the pretreatment intensity , resulting in lower ethanol production. an additional benefit of substrate delignification for ethanol production is clearly reflected in the current study. when the pretreated substrate is added to the medium, it reduces the effect of the inhibitors.

ethanol and glucose concentrations of ssf with different substrate loadings
the ethanol concentration reached  <dig>  g/l for 20 % substrate loading with a mixture of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr , making for an ethanol yield of  <dig>  % . the trends of ethanol production in the presence of lignin degradation are similar to that discussed above with pretreated fr and cr at various ratios. for the entire range of concentrations explored, no glucose was detected after 24 h. in contrast, the ethanol concentration decreased to  <dig>  g/l for 20 % substrate loading with a mixture of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr , and the corresponding ethanol yield was of approximately  <dig>  %. there was an observed downward trend in the final ethanol concentration after 120 h with decreasing substrate concentration or fr pretreatment intensity. the ethanol concentration value increased during the first 48 h and then remained unchanged until after 72 h for both sample a and sample b . the ethanol yield decreased with increasing substrate concentration , likely the result of higher lignocellulosic substrate viscosity leading to higher concentrations of inhibitors  <cit> . delignification of the raw materials had clear effects on ssf for both ethanol concentration and ethanol yield. the ethanol concentration increased by  <dig>  % between  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and untreated fr at the same substrate concentration  <cit> .fig.  <dig> concentrations of ethanol  and glucose  during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different substrate loadings with an fr:cr ratio of 2: <dig> at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr



another potential explanation for the increase in ethanol production when using cr might be the supplemented nutrient content. it has been shown that wheat hydrolysate can sustain anaerobic cultivation of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . in addition, tang et al. illustrated that corn hydrolysate can be used for the replacement of the organic medium in ssf of fr, as it is a complex organic nutrient  <cit> . the additional benefits of the amount of cr in the medium is clearly reflected in the current study.

the number of live yeast cells and the dead yeast ratio during ssf of pretreated fr mixed with cr
the profile of yeast concentration is shown in fig.  <dig>  when fermentation was conducted with fr and cr at 6 % substrate loading, the exponential and stationary phases were prolonged with a low-level phase, which indicates that yeast cell metabolism and growth decreased at the 6 % substrate concentration . higher substrate concentrations would provide an increased source of carbon  <cit> , which affects the yeast growth rate  <cit> . tang et al.  <cit>  explained that temperature affects carbon uptake, indicating that yeast cell concentration can be influenced by different factors. the yeast cell concentration was increased in ssf of mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr . the maximum cell concentration achieved at the 20 % substrate concentration, which suggests that increasing nutrient concentration could give rise to the increased yeast concentration during ethanol fermentation at 20 % substrate concentration compared with the lower substrate concentrations.fig.  <dig> the number of live yeast cells during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different substrate loadings with an fr:cr ratio of 2: <dig> at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr



the dead cell ratio at  <dig> and 8 % substrate concentrations of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr was initially high, which explains the hysteretic stationary phase observed during fermentation with these mixtures . a similar dead cell ratio was observed at  <dig> and 8 % substrate concentration with mixtures of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr . our results indicate that the dead cell ratio at 20 % substrate concentration was the lowest, but it increased with fermentation time. a high dead cell ratio represented increased sugar loss due to mortality of the yeast cells  <cit> . ethanol fermentation occurs mainly in the first 17 h, during which the yeast cells grow and metabolize actively, generating a low dead yeast ratio. a higher dead cell ratio of 30 % was observed from  <dig> to 48 h due to a decreasing glucose concentration and increasing ethanol concentration. after 48 h, glucose was depleted and the ethanol concentration approached the maximum value, caused a massive die-off of yeast cells. delignification has an effect on yeast growth. the mixtures of untreated fr and cr had a large variation among the different substrate concentrations, and they exhibited a lower cell concentration and higher dead cell ratio during the first 17 h of ssf  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the number of dead yeast cells during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  of furfural residues  and cassava residues  of different substrate loadings with an fr:cr ratio of 2: <dig> at ph  <dig> and 38 °c. a represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr, b represents the mixed substrates of  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr and cr. 6 %, 8 %, 12 %, 20 % represent the substrate concentration, respectively



CONCLUSIONS
the results of this investigation indicated that using delignified fr combined with cr as a source of readily fermentable sugars represents an untapped source for ethanol biofuel production. our results suggested that the increase in h2o <dig> concentration intensified the delignification of fr by increasing oxidation. the efficiency of ethanol fermentation was improved when delignification increased.

high intensity of fr pretreatment increased the final ethanol concentration, resulting in a high ethanol yield and a downward trend in the production of byproducts compared with ssf of the mixture of untreated fr and cr. the combination of gl-h2o <dig> pretreated fr and cr provided sufficient organic nutrients from starch materials for ssf and the production of additional ethanol from cr is beneficial for the integration of cellulosic and starch material, which leads to a high ethanol yield in ssf. ethanol production from ssf of a high substrate concentration of gl-h2o <dig> pretreated fr and cr is therefore cost-efficient.

the ethanol concentration increased by  <dig>  % from untreated fr to  <dig>  g/g-h2o2-gl-pretreated fr under the same substrate loading conditions. the number of live yeast cells increased with increasing substrate concentration, while the dead yeast ratio decreased.

further investigation is necessary to balance the ratio of gl-h2o <dig> pretreated fr and cr at high substrate concentration to improve the final ethanol concentration.
