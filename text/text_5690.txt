BACKGROUND
climate change poses a multi-dimensional threat to food and agricultural systems by affecting plant and animal production systems, stability of food supplies, food quality and access to food  <cit> . in addition to the increase in mean temperature, there is a predicted increase in the frequency of extreme temperature days  <cit> . such volatile temperatures put animals at increased risk of thermal stress, thereby potentially affecting animal growth, development, health, and food product quality.

thermal stress can manifest as extremes of both hot and cold temperatures. in addition to the obvious welfare issues, the effects of hot temperatures have been of particular interest to poultry producers due to effects on muscle that reduce meat quality. specifically, in chickens, chronic heat exposure results in lower weight gain, lower ratio of breast muscle to body weight, and increased intramuscular fat deposition  <cit> . turkey meat in particular is valued for its low fat content, thus increased fat deposition can decrease meat quality. in contrast, relatively severe cold stress slightly before slaughter in chickens resulted in decreased meat quality via changes in ph, color, and drip loss  <cit> . moderate cold stress in young chickens has also been shown to cause damage to the heart and duodenum – with the severity of injury increasing with the length of exposure  <cit> . the nature and extent of the physiological response to thermal stress is a function of genetic background as well as the timing of the stress  <cit> . fast growing lines of poultry tend to be more sensitive to thermal stress than slower growing lines  <cit> .

in this study, we utilized cultured turkey satellite cells as a model system to study the effects of thermal stress on muscle growth and development. satellite cells are muscle stem cells located between the basement membrane and sarcolemma of skeletal muscle fibers  <cit> . in the early post-hatch period, avian satellite cells respond to mild heat stress with accelerated proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . evidence from cell culture studies suggest that satellite cells are multi-potential stem cells which can be induced to follow myogenic, osteogenic, or adipogenic cellular pathways  <cit> . satellite cells are highly active during the period of rapid growth after hatch  <cit>  and then become quiescent until they are needed for hypertrophy or repair  <cit> . the increased fat deposition noted above may be the result of transdifferentiation of muscle satellite cells into adipocytes.

this study seeks to characterize the transcriptional changes induced in satellite cells cultured under hot or cold thermal challenge to better define molecular mechanisms by which thermal stress alters turkey breast muscle ultrastructure and consequently food quality. here we compare gene expression between cultured satellite cells derived from both fast and slow-growing lines in the context of thermal challenge. we hypothesize that satellite cell activity, its ultimate fate as a muscle cell or adipocyte, and thus overall muscle development will be altered by temperature. determining the satellite cell-mediated mechanisms associated with the development of superior meat quality will allow development of effective breeding, nutritional, and management strategies to promote the production of consistent, high quality muscle food products.

methods
turkey myogenic satellite cells
satellite cells were isolated from the pectoralis major muscle of 7-weeks-old males from the randombred control  <dig>  and body weight-selected  turkey lines as previously described  <cit> . the rbc <dig> line is maintained at the poultry research center of the ohio agricultural research development center/the ohio state university wooster, oh without conscious selection for any trait  <cit> . the f line was derived from the rbc <dig> line and selected only for 16weeks body weight  <cit> . these larger and faster- growing turkeys have greater p. major muscle and body weights than the rbc <dig> line  <cit> .

turkey p. major satellite cells were plated at a density of  <dig>  cells per well in  <dig> % gelatin coated 24-well plates . after plating, cells were incubated in a 38 °c 95% air/5% co <dig> incubator  for 24 h in plating medium consisting of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium , 10% chicken serum , 5% horse serum , 1% antibiotics-antimycotics, and  <dig> % gentamicin. after 24 h the plating medium was removed and the cells were fed growth medium consisting of mccoy’s 5a , 10% chicken serum, 5% horse serum, 1% antibiotics-antimycotics, and  <dig> % gentamicin. cells were cultured in a 38 °c 95% air/5% co <dig> incubator  or in a 95% air/5% co <dig> incubator held at an experimental temperature  for 72 h. growth medium was changed every 24 h for the 72 h treatment. cell medium was removed and the plates were held at −80 °c until rna isolation. the control temperature of 38 °c is lower than the body temperature of mature turkeys  but is approximately that measured in newly hatched poults . growth characteristics of these cells are further detailed in clark et al.  <cit> .

rna isolation and sequencing
total rna was isolated from each sample by trizol extraction , dnase-treated , and stored at −80 °c. initial rna concentration and quality was assessed by spectrophotometry . rna samples were submitted for library preparation and sequencing at the university of minnesota genomics center. each sample was quantified by ribogreen assay  and rna integrity was confirmed on the  <dig> bioanalyzer . replicate samples were sequenced from each treatment group . each sample had clear 18s and 28s peak separation on the electropherograms and rna integrity number  between  <dig>  and  <dig> . indexed libraries were constructed with 1 μg of total rna/sample with the truseq rna sample preparation kit version  <dig>  and size selected for approximately 200 bp inserts. libraries were multiplexed, pooled and sequenced over  <dig> lanes on the hiseq  <dig> using v <dig> chemistry  to produce 101-bp paired-end reads.

rnaseq data analyses
sequence adapters were removed and low quality bases were trimmed using trimmomatic  <cit>  enabled with the optional “-q” option; 3 bp sliding-window trimming from 3’ end requiring minimum q <dig>  quality control checks on raw sequence data for each sample were performed with fastqc  <cit> . read mapping was performed via bowtie  using the turkey genome . read counts were normalized in clc genomics workbench  by dividing the total read counts by the group sample sum and the results expressed as reads per 16m. hierarchical clustering of samples  was performed in clcgwb using normalized reads counts. empirical analysis of differential gene expression and anova was performed in clcgwb on original expression values . principal component analysis  was performed in clcgwb to identify and quantify variability in the data. volcano plots and venn diagrams were used to visualize the expression data and the results of significance testing. pair-wise comparisons between treatment groups were made in the bioconductor  r package deseq <dig>  <cit>  following the standard workflow. in each pair-wise comparison, significant de genes were used to investigate affected gene pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis  . gene enrichment tests were performed using the panther overrepresentation test . go analysis utilized the reference gene set of the chicken  of which ~63% of the turkey loci  had id homologs.

RESULTS
total rna isolated from satellite cell cultures  was used for construction of individual barcoded libraries. sequencing of all libraries produced over 195m reads . the number of reads per library ranged from  <dig> m to  <dig> m  . after read trimming and filtering, median q score was consistently high and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . box-plots demonstrate that quality scores across base position in each corrected dataset were sufficiently high for reliable base calling . the number of reads per treatment group ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> m with an average of  <dig> m ±  <dig>  m reads. replicate libraries produced comparable results with an average difference between replicates of  <dig> m reads.table  <dig> summary of rnaseq data for proliferation experiment

gene expression
approximately 89% of the quality trimmed reads mapped uniquely to the annotated turkey gene set  with an estimated mean library insert of  <dig>  bp. this percentage was consistent across treatment groups. for all libraries, the percentage of aligned read pairs exceeded 87%  and the majority of reads  mapped concordantly to the gene set . a total of  <dig>  genes was detected  with an average of  <dig>  per treatment group . mean read depth was  <dig>  reads/gene . when limited by the average number of mapped reads , the mean number of expressed genes  was reduced  and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  within treatment groups .

principal component analysis  was used to visualize the variation among treatment groups based on normalized read counts . treatment groups generally clustered distinctly  within the first two principal components  irrespective of line. hierarchical clustering of groups by euclidean distance reiterated the relationships shown by pca . groups clustered by line and incubation temperature. all replicate treatment pairs occurred as nearest neighbors, supporting the pooling of replicates for expression analyses. differences in gene expression among groups are illustrated in the heat map which includes the co-expressed genes with the greatest experiment-wise differences in average expression.fig.  <dig> principal component analysis  of rnaseq data based on normalized read counts. sample to sample distances  are illustrated for each dataset on the first two principal components comprising approximately 98% of the variation. samples are plotted according to treatment




distribution of unique and shared expressed genes among treatment groups are illustrated in table  <dig>  on average  <dig>  genes were co-expressed between treatment groups, within temperature and  <dig>  genes were co-expressed between lines. this reflects an overall similarity in response of cultured satellite cells between the turkey lines. numbers of uniquely expressed genes were higher for the f-line at all incubation temperatures . in comparing treatment groups, the highest numbers of shared genes occurred between the 33 °c and 38 °c treatments for both lines .table  <dig> summary of gene expression and significant differential expression  in pair-wise comparisons of proliferating cells

characterization of the expressed genes in satellite cells under the control incubation temperature  provided a description of the common cellular processes of these cultured cells . at 72 h of proliferation, the majority of gene products  are characterized as nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins. plasma membrane and extracellular proteins comprise the other major groups . enzyme, transcription regulator, and transporter are the largest represented functional classes of proteins. however, the largest class of gene products  includes primarily structural proteins .fig.  <dig> go classification of genes expressed in cultured turkey p. major satellite cells after 72 h proliferation at 38 °c




of the turkey annotated gene set,  <dig>  ids mapped in the ipa database. normalized read counts for the  <dig>  genes with the highest average read count were used to conduct a comparison analysis between the rbc <dig> and f-line groups at 38 °c. the  <dig> most significant metabolic and signaling pathways identified in the expressed genes are summarized in additional file 4: table s <dig>  most significant in the metabolic category are trna charging  and the inositol phosphate compound superpathway . significant signaling pathways include protein ubiquitination  and eif <dig> signaling .

differential expression
gaussian-based anova found  <dig>  genes with significant  experiment-wise differential expression . seven two-way contrasts were generated based on temperature  and line . large numbers of significant differentially expressed  genes were identified in each contrast . a greater number of genes were significantly affected by cold  treatment than by hot  with more de genes identified in the f-line at both 33 °c and 43 °c compared to control . in the temperature comparisons, a greater proportion of de genes were up-regulated, except in the rbc <dig> 43 °c versus 38 °c comparison where the proportion of down-regulated genes was greater . the  <dig> significant de genes with the greatest expression change for each treatment comparison are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed genes during proliferation of cultured turkey p. major satellite cells. for each temperature comparison, the number of genes with fdr pval < <dig>  and |log2fc| >  <dig>  that were shared or unique to each line  are indicated in the venn diagram  <cit> . circle size is proportional to the number of genes




statistical overrepresentation tests  of genes differentially expressed between the 33 °c and 38 °c found greatest enrichment for the go biological processes of muscle system, synaptic transmission, and cell-signaling . greatest enrichment of go cellular components included sarcomere, ion channel complex and transmembrane transporter complex whereas calcium ion binding and signal transducer activity represented significantly enriched go molecular functions. in contrast, overrepresentation tests of genes differentially expressed between the 43 °c and 38 °c found significant enrichment for several go biological processes defining muscle development . seven of these go categories , regulation of myotube differentiation , regulation of striated muscle cell differentiation , muscle contraction , regulation of muscle contraction , regulation of muscle system process , and muscle system process ) showed greater than 5-fold enrichment. enrichment of go cellular components reflected the shift towards muscle structure as did molecular function.

although the ingenuity knowledge base of  is human-centric, it provides useful insight into non-mammalian biological systems. ipa analysis of the turkey de genes demonstrated several temperature-induced shifts in the satellite cell transcriptomes. consistent with ongoing cellular development, many of the statistically enriched pathways involved in cell signaling  and the top gene networks involved skeletal and muscle system development. cell signaling is an import aspect of satellite cells in regulating cell-to-cell interactions during development and homeostasis and in controlling self-renewal. the calcium and calmodulin activated gene nfatc <dig>  was common to several of these pathways. this gene has been shown in mammals to be critical for the fusion of myoblasts with nascent myotubes  <cit> . also important were ligands such as the wnt family of proteins, receptor and modulating molecules such as fzd  and dkk , and growth factors such as igf .

the skeletal and muscle system development network depicted in fig.  <dig> demonstrates the differential myogenic response in the turkey satellite cells at 33 °c versus 38 °c with several interacting muscle-associated genes being down regulated . included within this network are genes such as trim <dig>  and fam65b . in humans, the trim <dig> protein is involved in cell cycle regulatory processes of striated muscle cells  <cit> . fam65b is expressed both in myogenic and non-myogenic primary human cells and is upregulated during muscle cell differentiation  <cit> . in contrast, many of these same genes were up regulated in cells proliferated at the higher temperature  . the magnitude of expression change was greater in the f-line  that in rbc <dig> . this is especially evident for members of the troponin complex , but also includes genes such as unc45b  which plays a role in sarcomere formation during muscle cell development.fig.  <dig> example gene network identified from differentially expressed genes by ingenuity pathway analysis  showing differential response of p. major satellite cell transcriptome to temperature. depicted is the top scoring skeletal and muscle system development network identified by comparison analysis. a) rbc <dig> line, 33 °c versus 38 °c. b) f line, 33 °c versus 38 °c. c). rbc <dig> line, 43 °c versus 38 °c. d) f line, 43 °c versus 38 °c. in each panel the direction  and magnitude  of expression changes are indicate for each of the group comparisons. gray indicates molecule that were included in the dataset but did not meet the significance cutoff value. shapes within the networks correspond to genes, gene products, or small molecules and “double circle” symbols indicate gene complexes or groups




the majority of de genes were also unique to treatment groups  . however,  <dig> significant de genes were shared among all treatment comparisons, identifying a suite of genes that are jointly affected by deviation from the control incubation temperature. these included casq <dig>  a calcium binding protein that stores calcium for muscle function, efemp <dig>  which may play a role in cell adhesion and migration, and genes such as fat <dig> , and nkd <dig>  which help control and maintain planar cell polarity. others include igsf9b , ntsr <dig> , ptgs <dig> , rbm <dig> , tppp <dig>  and four model loci . these  <dig> genes fall into four categories: up-regulated in both cold and hot treatments relative to control , down-regulated in both treatments , up-regulated by cold but down-regulated by heat  and up-regulated by heat but down-regulated by cold .

effects of selection 
at the control temperature 38 °c,  <dig> genes showed significant de with |log2fc| >  <dig>  in comparisons between the f-line and rbc <dig> . of these,  <dig> were unique to the temperature comparison . the majority of the unique genes  were down regulated in the f-line. significantly enriched go biological processes involving these  <dig> genes were synaptic transmission  and system development. loci unique to 38 °c showing the greatest up regulation in the f-line were loc <dig> , drd <dig> , camkk <dig> , and those showing the greatest down regulation were meox <dig> , loc <dig> , and syt <dig> . broadly defined these genes function in regulating transcription, neuronal growth and development, exocytosis, and apoptosis.fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed genes between lines  during p. major satellite cell proliferation. for each temperature comparison, the number of genes with fdr pval < <dig>  and |log2fc| >  <dig>  that were shared or unique to each incubation temperature are indicated. the number and direction of expression change  for the genes included in each temperature group are listed outside the venn diagram. circle size is proportional to the number of genes




greater differences were observed between the genetic lines in the 33 °c and 43 °c thermal challenges. at 33 °c,  <dig> genes showed significant de and |log2fc| >  <dig> . of these,  <dig> were unique to the temperature comparison . at 43 °c, differential expression of  <dig> loci was significant  with  <dig> being unique. at 33 °c, 60% of the  <dig> de genes were down regulated in the f-line compared to rbc <dig>  significantly enriched go biological processes included nervous system development and cell communication. loci unique to 33 °c showing the greatest up regulation in the f line were gas <dig>  and loc <dig> , and those showing the greatest down regulation were kcnip <dig> , loc <dig> , and loc <dig>  chain-like) a fibrillar collagen. gas <dig> is a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid  domain-containing protein thought to be involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation  <cit> . p2y purinoceptor  <dig> belongs to the family of g-protein coupled receptors. binding of adp to the p2yr <dig> receptor is involved in calcium signaling  <cit> . kcnip <dig> encodes a member of the family of cytosolic voltage-gated potassium  channel-interacting proteins that regulate neuronal membrane excitability in response to intracellular calcium  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of wnt family gene expression observed in thermally challenged turkey muscle satellite cells

in contrast to the trend observed at 33 °c and 38 °c, at 43 °c the greatest proportion  of the  <dig> de genes  were up regulated in the f-line vs rbc <dig>  of these,  <dig> loci were uniquely significant to this temperature comparison. significantly enriched go biological processes included muscle contraction, mesoderm and system development, proliferation, differentiation and cell signaling. loci unique to 43 °c showing the greatest up regulation in the f line included ace , loc <dig> , lrrc <dig> , hck , fgf <dig> , dnase2b , ccdc <dig> , and txlnb . greatest down regulation was observed for loc <dig> . interestingly, in humans dach <dig> encodes a chromatin-associated transcription factor that acts to regulate cell fate determination during development  <cit> .

expression differences between the rbc <dig> and f line are further exemplified by the genes that are shared among the temperature treatments . for example,  <dig> genes showed significant  differential expression between the lines at all three temperatures. interestingly, all nine were down regulated in the f line. genes showing the greatest expression differences included tecrl  and loc <dig>  . although little is known about the function of tecrl, this protein with oxidoreductase activity is thought to be involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis and through the pathway regulation of lipid metabolism by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha  . histone deacetylase  <dig> is a member of the histone deacetylase family which acts in repression of gene transcription by affecting transcription factor access to dna  <cit> . ctnnd <dig> , delta 2) and gabra <dig>  a receptor, alpha 2) showed decreased expression with temperature elevation. both of these genes are described in humans as being active in the mammalian brain. ctnnd <dig> plays a role in cell adhesion and movement  <cit>  and gabra <dig> is associated with neurotransmitter inhibition but go annotations include chloride channel activity.

comparison of the de genes shared among the temperature pairs  found more genes shared between the 33 °c and 38 °c treatments  and a similar trend for reduced expression  in the f-line . greatest change was observed for loc <dig>  a fox-family transcription factor with average log2fc = - <dig>   in f versus rbc <dig> cells. genes shared between 38 °c and 43 °c showed a mixture of up and down regulation between the lines and genes shared by the two temperature extremes  were either mixed in response or upregulated in the f-line. an example of the former is loc <dig>  where the gene was down regulated in f-line cells at 33 °c  but up regulated  at 43 °c.

discussion
extreme temperature changes are of particular concern to the poultry industry because of the detrimental effects on muscle that ultimately impact meat quality. satellite cells are multipotential-stem cells located between the basement membrane and sarcolemma of myofibers  <cit> . as the only source of posthatch myonuclei, these cells are a self-renewing stem cell population responsible for all posthatch skeletal muscle growth  <cit> . during postnatal development, satellite cells provide myonuclei to promote skeletal muscle growth  <cit> . in adults, myonuclei promote homeostasis through repair, regeneration or hypertrophy. in poultry, satellite cells are most active the first week after hatch  <cit> .

the function and fate of satellite cells are influenced by the local microenvironment and expression of myogenic regulatory factors  <cit> . satellite cells are characterized by their expression of transcription factors  and through signaling, activate myogenic determination genes such as myf <dig> and myod  <cit> . quiescent cells are pax7+ but do not express myod or myogenin and most are myf <dig> positive  <cit> . both myf <dig> and myod are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors required for muscle differentiation. alternate expression of these proteins following proliferation influences cell fate  <cit> . proliferating and differentiating myoblasts express myod whereas myogenin expression occurs during differentiation.

as demonstrated in the thermal challenge of cultured turkey satellite cells, cold treatment resulted in an overrepresentation of genes involved in cell signaling/signal transduction and cell communication . in contrast, heat-treated cells showed greater tendency towards muscle system development and differentiation . satellite cell proliferation and differentiation is directly influenced by the cell niche including signaling molecules, hormones and innervation  <cit> . the activation and proliferation of satellite cells is modulated by signaling molecules  and growth factors . satellite cells derived from single muscle fibers quickly reenter the cell cycle, express myod, and given the necessary substrates, establish proliferative colonies and differentiate into myotubes  <cit> . in the chicken, proliferating satellite cells express pax <dig> and myod but not myogenin  <cit> . in vivo, signaling between vascular and satellite cells is required for satellite cell activation and extrinsic signaling molecules orchestrate myogenisis  <cit> . in the present study, myod <dig>  and several interacting genes were significantly upregulated in the heat exposed f-line cells .

myogenesis is controlled by signaling pathways that direct expression of the chief myogenic regulators. among these pathways are those activated by wnt ligands  <cit> . wnt ligands are critical signaling molecules controlling various aspects of both muscle development and regeneration. in humans,  <dig> wnt genes have been described  <cit> . chicken genome contains  <dig> wnt genes that are homologous to the corresponding human and mouse genes  <cit> . the turkey gene set includes  <dig> wnt loci of which three correspond to wnt <dig> . the only mammalian homolog missing in these galliformes is wnt10b. in the chicken, wnt3a and wnt7b encode alternative first exon isoforms. although the interplay among wnt pathways is still an area of investigation, it is clear that signaling through both the canonical wnt/β-catenin and non-canonical wnt pathways  are important in myogenesis and neuromuscular synaptogenesis. the wnt/ca + signaling pathway was among the top canonical pathways altered in the proliferating turkey satellite cells .

differentiation of mammalian adult satellite cells is controlled via wnt signaling which influences the expression of myogenic regulatory factors. wnt <dig>  3a and 5a induce proliferation whereas  <dig> and  <dig> are inhibitory  <cit> . canonical wnt signaling and activation of b-catenin/tcf transcriptional complexes regulate stem cell differentiation. non-canonical wnt-signaling mediates satellite cell renewal and myofiber growth through activation of pathways such as the akt/mtor pathway  <cit> . activation of wnt b-catenin signaling may also be important in modulating early regenerative processes following injury  <cit> . several members of the wnt family are up-regulated in myoblasts and myofibers of regenerating muscle  <cit> . during regeneration, wnt5a, 5b and 7a are upregulated early while wnt <dig> expression is down regulated. wnt7b and 3a are expressed later. wnt7a is important in the induction of satellite cells through pcp signaling and overexpression of wnt7a results in higher satellite cell numbers. overexpression of wnt <dig> in chicken embryos enhanced differentiation and increased muscle mass  <cit> .

significant de was observed for several of the turkey wnt genes in the challenged satellite cells. wnt <dig> and 5b were significantly down regulated at both challenge temperatures compared to control and in both lines and were down regulated in all comparisons. wnt2b, 3a, 9a and 10a were significantly up-regulated in cold-treated cells whereas wnt <dig> and 7a were significantly up-regulated in heat treated satellite cells . some of these genes had only minor expression changes; however, wnt3a,  <dig>  7b and 9a had log2fc >  <dig>  only one wnt gene  showed significant de between the rbc <dig> ad f-lines. at 43 °c, expression of wnt7a was significantly higher in the f-line . these findings support the importance of cell signaling during proliferation of these satellite cells and suggest targets for further research on the differential control of satellite cell proliferation.

studies of the self-renewal processes in muscle suggest that the satellite cell pool is heterogeneous; comprised of self-renewing stem cells and predestined myogenic precursors  <cit> . myogenic and adipogenic cells may represent separate satellite cell populations. several studies have reported the non-myogenic differentiation of satellite cells  <cit> . the capacity for non-myogenic differentiation may ultimately lie in the heterogeneous nature of the satellite cell population  <cit> . most satellite cells from myofibers cannot spontaneously differentiate into adipocytes  <cit> . however, they can be activated in culture to induce osteogenic and apidogenic pathways in addition to myogenesis. osteogenic differentiation is reportedly induced via bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  and adipogenic fate can be altered by wnt signaling. powell et al.  <cit>  found p. major satellite cells to express apidogenic genes when subjected to nutrient restriction. gene expression of cultured quiescent and regenerating myoblasts may differ significantly from in vivo satellite cells  <cit>  as satellite cell progeny in culture are distinct from cells newly isolated from muscle  <cit> .

there is debate regarding the ability of satellite cells to adopt a true osteogenic or apidogenic fate. for example, starkey et al.  <cit>  suggest that satellite cells accumulate lipid in culture but do not undergo apidogenic differentiation to adopt a new fate even under apidogenic-inducing conditions. in vivo results demonstrated both adipocyte formation in the connective tissue surrounding the muscle fiber bundles and within muscle fiber bundles  <cit> . as interpreted by smith and johnson  <cit> , adipocytes formed in the connective tissue between muscle bundles in poultry is similar to true marbling. deposition of adipocytes within muscle bundles in the avian p. major muscle is consistent with the conversion of muscle satellite cells to adipocytes.

signaling is important in determining cell fate as myocytes, apidocytes and osteocytes originate from the same embryonic precursor cells. wnt and notch signaling controls satellite cell fate. myoblasts from cultured myofibers only respond to wnt signaling late in differentiation, whereas notch signaling regulates proliferation, differentiation and determination of cell fate. low activity of wnt signaling early in proliferation may allow for sufficient myoblast expansion via notch signaling  <cit> . commitment to the myocyte lineage may require wnt signaling as disruption in vitro causes transdifferentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes.

temperature can alter satellite cell proliferation, differentiation and ultimately cell fate , which can impact skeletal muscle growth and meat quality  <cit> . immature poults have an inefficient thermoregulatory system and are sensitive to extreme temperatures. increased temperatures can affect lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression of satellite cells  <cit> . the increase in intramuscular fat accumulation may be mediated, at least in part, by satellite cells that transdifferentiate to an adipogenic lineage  <cit> . in mammals, key adipogenic genes are essential for the transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis and is controlled by a cascade of transcription factors led by the ccaat/enhancer-binding protein  β  <cit> .

very early in adipocyte differentiation, induction of cebpβ  results in the downstream expression of pparg  and cebpa  as cebpb directly binds to their promoters  <cit> . delayed transactivation of pparg and cebpa by cebpb appears necessary for mitotic clonal expansion and progression of terminal differentiation, a process required for adipogenesis  <cit> . preadipocytes are maintained in an undifferentiated state through inhibition of cebpb and pparg by signaling though wnt <dig>  however, decrease in wnt10b may be required for adipogenesis and this ligand may be an endogenous regulator  <cit> . interestingly, cebpb also suppresses canonical wnt-β catenin signaling through transcriptional inhibition of the wnt ligand  that inhibits apidogenesis  <cit> . as the wnt10b homolog is absent from the turkey genome, it is not known which of the wnt family members, or if any directly inhibit apidogenesis.

expression studies of adipogenic genes in poultry have resulted in mixed outcomes. harding et al.  <cit>  found satellite cells isolated from the p. major muscle of chickens to have a greater tendency to express adipogenic genes than those isolated from the biceps femoris muscle. within the p. major satellite cells, cebpb expression, as measured by qrt-pcr, increased with increasing temperature, while pparg expression decreased  <cit> . in the same satellite cell culture system used in the present study, we  <cit>  found expression of cebpb, pparg and stearoyl-coa desaturase , to decrease as temperature increased from 33 °c to 43 °c at 72 h of proliferation despite an observed increase in adiposity.

in the present study significant differences in cebpb, pparg and scd were observed among the temperature/group comparisons, but the degree of expression change in general was small . for example, cebpb expression significantly decreased in satellite cells from both the rbc <dig> and f-lines as temperature increased. expression of cebpb was significantly higher at 33 °c compared to 38 °c in cells from both lines but with low overall fold change . overall expression was slightly lower in f-line cells, but this difference was not significant at any temperature. expression of pparg was significantly higher at 33 °c compared to 38 °c in cells from both lines but with low overall fold change . expression of pparg at 43 °c was significantly higher in rbc <dig> cells but significantly lower in f-line cells compared to cells incubated at 38 °c. again in both comparisons the degree of change was small . as nuclear factors, small changes in genes like cebpb and pparg may have amplified downstream effects. expression of scd was higher in f-line cells at all temperatures and this difference was significant at 33 °c and 38 °c. the greatest difference occurred at 33 °c where expression in f-line cells was  <dig>  x higher. expression of scd was lowest in both lines at 38 °c but increased in both lines at 43 °c . these rnaseq results are consistent with our experiments  <cit>  that measured expression of these genes by qrt-pcr in the same satellite cell culture system.

as demonstrated in the present study, temperature significantly alters gene expression in turkey skeletal muscle satellite cells. numerous significant gene expression differences were observed between cells when incubated at higher  or lower  temperatures. it is also apparent that genetic selection for 16weeks body weight  has altered satellite cells gene expression. one hypothesis is that selection has altered the satellite cell niche through reduced innervation or limited vascularization. satellite cells isolated from f line turkeys have increased proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . clark et al.  <cit>  found satellite cells of the f line to be more sensitive to temperature changes during proliferation and differentiation. when incubated at temperatures above 38 °c, f line satellite cells also had less intracellular lipid accumulation compared to rbc <dig> cells. this suggested that growth selection has changed the proportion of resident satellite cells able to convert to an adipogenic lineage in response to thermal cues. although the ability of the cultured cells to adopt a true non-myogenic fate is unknown, a decrease in adipocyte-like properties could limit in vivo transdifferentiation of satellite cells to an adipogenic lineage  <cit> .

exposure of poultry to extreme temperatures, especially in the critical post-hatch time-frame, can seriously compromise the quality of meat. with climate change, the frequency and intensity of temperature extremes are expected to grow, thereby exacerbating problems with meat production. worldwide demand for lean, high-quality animal protein continues to expand, and the industry must develop birds that can withstand thermal variation while yielding high-quality meat. understanding the impact of thermal stress on satellite cells is critical to this effort. the results of this study provide important insights into the proliferation of turkey stem cells in response to thermal challenge.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that temperature significantly alters gene expression in satellite cells of turkey skeletal muscle. numerous gene expression differences were observed between cells incubated at both lower  and higher  temperatures as compared to control . enrichment analysis indicated a shift at 33 °c towards cell signaling whereas at 43 °c cells had gene expression profiles with a shift towards muscle development. for example, markers of cell proliferation such as myod <dig> and several interacting genes were significantly upregulated in the heat exposed cells. cell signaling is critical during satellite cell proliferation and differential expression of chief myogenic regulators and pathways activated by wnt ligands were observed. the wnt/ca + signaling pathway was among the canonical pathways significantly altered in the proliferating turkey satellite cells. transcriptome analysis found greater differences in gene expression for satellite cells from the growth selected f-line as compared to its random bred control. genes significantly altered by cold treatment tended to be down regulated in the f-line cells whereas genes significantly altered by heat treatment tended to be up regulated. this study provides important insights into the proliferation of turkey skeletal muscle stem cells in response to thermal challenge and identifies new targets for further research on the differential control of satellite cell proliferation in poultry.
