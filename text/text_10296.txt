BACKGROUND

neisseria gonorrhoeae colonizes the mucosal surfaces of the urogenital tract and causes gonorrhea, one of the most commonly reported sexually transmitted diseases. due to the high incidence of infections and a global rise in multi-drug resistance strains, both the cdc and who have designated n. gonorrhoeae as a “super bug”, due to the pan-resistant nature of some strains in the gonococcal population  <cit> . we and others have reported the importance of the fe-response regulon in infection and a wide range of cellular pathways including stress and oxidative responses . the central transcriptional regulatory protein controlling the fe regulon is the fur protein which binds to conserved fur box  sequences in the promoters of fe-responsive genes along with ferrous fe+ <dig> leading to transcriptional repression. as intracellular fe stores are depleted, the fur-fe+ <dig> complex dissociate and fur is released from the promoter allowing transcription. fur also has the capacity to induce gene transcription in response to fe levels through both direct and indirect mechanisms . indirect control of gene transcription is mediated through the action of secondary regulators including srnas  <cit> . in other bacteria, srnas control gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms during adaptation to environmental cues, including those provided by the host environment  <cit> . dependent on their targets, srnas can be classified into two broad categories. cis-acting srnas, varying in size from 100– <dig> nucleotides  are typically either riboswitches encoded in the 5′ utr of the regulatory target or are co-transcribed antisense to the target gene  <cit> . antisense srnas overlap all or part of the gene, or are located encoded on the 5′ or 3′ end of the protein-coding gene that they regulate. trans-acting, typically 50–500 nt in length  <cit>  most commonly target ribosomal binding sites near promoters, but may also exert regulatory control by binding to regulatory proteins and modifying their activity. where cis-acting srnas generally target their cognate protein-coding rna, trans-acting srnas bind targets on diverse mrnas through imperfect base pair matches. in many gram negative organisms, these trans-acting srnas often require the rna chaperone hfq  <cit> . srnas often contain a rho-independent terminator , an inverted repeat hairpin structure on the 3′ end that halts transcription of the srna.

deep sequencing of next generation directional libraries and computational models to predict srnas have each dramatically increased srna discovery in many organisms  <cit> . in n. gonorrhoeae, whole transcriptome rna-seq analysis of strain ms <dig> identified  <dig> potentially non-coding srnas of which  <dig> mapped to intergenic regions  <cit> . in another study,  <dig> potential srnas were identified from four different growth conditions  with seven confirmed by northern analysis in gonococcal strain f <dig>  <cit> . more recently, ngs analysis of a fur mutant in f <dig> identified  <dig> small rnas showing either increased or decreased expression compared to the wild type strain  in the presence of fe  <cit> .

in the present study, we took a slightly different approach by taking advantage of deep-sequencing directional libraries to enrich for srna discovery across the growth curve allowing us to assess both temporal- and fe regulation. we report  <dig> srnas regulated by fe, of which  <dig> were induced in late log through stationary phase, with an additional srna expressed in low fe conditions. eight were putative trans-acting srnas with the remaining seven putative cis-acting srnas. we previously proposed that the fe-repressible neisserial srna nrrf functions to buffer the effects of fur repression by fine-tuning mrna turnover  <cit> . we were therefore interested in whether nrrf may have a similar effect on the expression of these fe-regulated srnas. transcriptional analysis of the  <dig> fe-regulated small rnas in an nrrf mutant strain identified  <dig> putative trans-acting small rnas that appear to be regulated by nrrf.

RESULTS
rna-seq analysis of n. gonorrhoeae fa  <dig> fe regulated “srnaome”
size-selected directional libraries were sequenced from libraries prepared from the gonococcus grown in a defined medium under fe-replete and –deplete growth conditions through stationary phase  . 150 bp single reads were aligned to the fa  <dig> genome  and analyzed using rockhopper, a software designed for small rna and transcriptome analysis of bacterial rna-seq data  <cit>  . predicted srnas in the range > <dig> to <500 nt were examined for the presence of a promoter and rit by extracting 150 bp 5′ and 3′ of the reads, using bprom and arnold, respectively .

candidate srnas identified as potential coding sequences   <cit>  were subsequently omitted from the data set leaving a pool of  <dig> intergenic and  <dig> anti-sense srnas present in at least one time point during the growth curve . expression of fe-responsive genes and srnas such as nrrf in the gonococcus are directly regulated by fur binding to fb consensus sequences near promoters  <cit> , therefore; a computational approach was taken to predict fbs that may be associated with fe-regulated srnas. initially, using meme analysis of a training set of fa  <dig> sequences experimentally validated to bind fur by furta  and/or emsa   <cit> , an 18 bp direct repeat sequence was generated representing the fur dna-binding consensus sequence for fa  <dig> . hmm  and pwm  models were then built and each model was used to scan the entire fa  <dig> genome. the predicted fb sequences extracted from both models were merged and imported into artemis for visualization. the fe-starvation status of cells used in these experiments was verified by assessing nrrf expression, which was highly repressed at all time points by real time pcr . nrrf transcript size and transcriptional start site  are in agreement with previous studies   <cit> .fig.  <dig> transcriptional analysis of fe repressed srna nrrf. iron regulation was confirmed with real time pcr transcriptional analysis of rna samples isolated for rna-seq from cells collected  <dig> , <dig>  and 5 h. a the tss was resolved by primer extension using a fam labeled primer yielding a 123 bp fragment as analyzed with peak scanner b) and a transcript length of 154 bp as determined by northern blot analysis d). tss for nrrf is indicated by an ^ in the nrrf sequence in c), with red denoting the fb sequence and bold type the − <dig> promoter region. blue represents the rit, with the unlined portion of the sequence the location of the fam labeled primer used for the primer extension c)




rfam database search of known regulatory small rnas
comparison of our rna-seq data with the rfam  <dig>  database  <cit>  revealed known regulatory rnas including rnase p, tmrna and a thiamine pyrophosphate  riboswitch, two tandem glycine riboswitches and one sam riboswitch . of the known regulatory rnas, the sam riboswitch was fe-regulated . riboswitches are a class of srnas that are often cis-acting regulatory loci originating in the 5′ utr of the transcript they modulate by sensing metabolites and controlling genes involved in transport and synthesis of amino acids, metal ions, nucleotides and cofactors  <cit> . in fa  <dig>  the sam riboswitch is located in the 5′ utr of methionine adenosyltransferase gene  and cis to a hypothetical protein ngo_ <dig>  suggesting that this riboswitch also acts to regulate the expression of ngo_ <dig>  the sam riboswitch was not regulated by nrrf; as real time pcr transcriptional analysis showed no effect in the nrrf mutant . the tss and transcript length of 155 bp were determined by primer extension and northern blot analysis .fig.  <dig> fe regulation of fa  <dig> sam riboswitch. the sam riboswitch is located in the 5′ utr of the methionine adenosyltransferase gene ngo_ <dig> and anti-sense to hypothetical protein ngo_ <dig>  fb indicates the presence of a fur box consensus sequence. a real time pcr rna samples results from cells harvested at  <dig> , <dig>  and 5 h showing induction of sam riboswitch transcription in the presence of fe beginning at late log and increasing into stationary phase. each bar represents the mean fold change comparing fe replete to fe deplete growth conditions from three separate growth curves b). asterisks indicate a significant increase in fold change values 




as the effector molecule s-adenomethionine  reaches a threshold concentration, binding to the riboswitch inhibits the downstream message through formation of a terminator. in the absence of sam binding, an anti-terminator is formed and transcription of the downstream gene proceeds  <cit> . presumably, the gonococcal sam riboswitch functions in a similar manner by sensing sam levels and disrupting methionine adenosyltransferase transcription as the ligand binds to the riboswitch. the sam riboswitch in fa  <dig> is induced in the presence of fe with temporal transcriptional increases into stationary phase . the methionine adenosyltransferase transcript is also directly regulated by fur as evidenced by a predicted fb sequence in the promoter region . this is consistent with the finding of a fur chip-seq peak in the 5′ utr of ngo_ <dig> in fa  <dig> grown in fe replete conditions . transcriptional profiles as determined by real time pcr confirm repression of the methionine adenosyltransferase transcript beginning at late log through stationary phase . in this scenario, fur binding to the fb sequence when fe is present may exert a stronger regulatory effect on methionine adenosyltransferase transcription. if this is the case, studies in listeria monocytogenes may suggest additional roles for the sam riboswitch in the gonococcus. loh et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that terminated sam riboswitch transcripts were able to function as a trans-acting srna regulating expression of a distal target through binding to the 5′ utr of master virulence regulator prfa. whether the gonococcal sam riboswitch may function as a trans-acting srna potentially linking nutritional availability to the fe regulon will require additional studies.

srnas regulated temporally and by fe-availability
we designated srnas with equivalent fe regulation in wt and nrrf mutant strain lj <dig>  as nrf ; see table  <dig> for genetic designation and genomic location. eight srnas were induced beginning in late log to stationary phase with one srna  repressed in fe-deplete conditions . four fe-induced srnas previously have been reported in rna-seq studies for n. gonorrhoeae strains ms <dig> and/or f <dig>  <cit> . nrfa, nrfb, and nrfi  were highly expressed in ms <dig> in the presence of fe  <cit> . rna-seq reads aligning to nrfa and nrfe were present in f <dig> strain however; these transcripts were not fe regulated in the experimental conditions used in that study  <cit> . expression of srnas; nrfc, nrfd, nrff, nrfg and nrfh have not been reported in the gonococcus. several of these novel fe-regulated srnas merit further discussion.table  <dig> genomic location of fe regulated srnas

interestingly of the  <dig> srnas reported here nrfd was the only fe repressed srna and did not exhibit temporal regulation with a modest 2-fold change in expression through all time points tested as determined by real time pcr . the nrfd transcript is antisense to a 192 bp region of the protease domain in the iga gene , . iga protease, a known virulence factor in pathogenic neisseria is derived from a modular autotransporter protein directing the secretion of this serine protease to mucosal surfaces  <cit> . a genome-wide in silico analysis of fb locations in fa  <dig> of the fe-regulated srnas predicted a fb in the promoter region of nrfd. . although the regulatory role of intragenic fbs in controlling transcription is not fully understood, we have previously shown using emsas that fur binds to two discrete intragenic fb sequences in tbpa, the gonococcal transferrin receptor protein  <cit> . additionally, in a fur chip-seq study,  the intracellular fb sequence predicted near the promoter of nrfd bound fur as detected by the presence of a peak overlapping that region in fa  <dig>  suggesting direct regulation of nrfd by fur. pathogenic neisseria produce and secrete iga protease in order to cleave iga molecules, consequently interfering with the hosts’ innate mucosal immunity  <cit> . in addition, iga protease increases the degradation rate of host lamp <dig>  a major membrane protein in lysosomal vacuoles, thereby promoting enhanced intracellular survival  <cit> . although the mechanism whereby nrfd regulates the gonococcal iga protease is not known; we speculate this potential cis-acting srna could play an important role in modulation of the host’s immune response at the mucosal surface and survival within host cells in response to fe levels.

the nrff transcript spans a 192 bp region antisense to the 3′ end of ngo_ <dig>  harboring the proteolytic domain of lon protease  with transcription steadily increasing in the presence of fe beginning at late log through stationary phase . bacteria adapt to environmental stresses by changing the overall protein profile through transcriptional control, but also through protein degradation by proteases. one important serine protease is the lon protease, accounting for the majority of energy-dependent proteolytic activity in cells by targeting misfolded or damaged proteins for degradation during stress conditions as well as responding to dna damage  <cit> . lon protease and other atp-dependent proteases have been shown to be involved in stationary phase adaptation through several regulatory pathways . given that lon protease can exert a global effect, transcriptional regulation would be important to keep protein degradation in check. in fact, overexpression of lon protease in e. coli leads to lethality  <cit> . typically, cis-acting srnas modulate expression of their cognate rna through binding and promotion of message degradation. thus, a likely mechanism for nrff action would be to regulate lon protease expression post-transcriptionally in a similar manner. however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of nrff in the fe regulon and potential regulation of this important protease.

nrfg is oriented between membrane protein ngo_ <dig> and ngo_ <dig>  a hypothetical protein  of interest is a 106 bp correia repeat enclosed element  overlapping a region of the promoter of this fe-induced srna . cree are 69–151 bp regions flanked by terminal repeats and a conserved core structure found only in neisseria spp  <cit> . insertion of cree has been reported to inactivate genes  <cit> . alternatively, cree insertion adjacent to the 5′ end of a gene can create a promoter at either or both ends due to the presence of inverted repeats in the element  <cit> . a recent study investigated whether cree are found near predicted srnas in gonococcal strain nccp <dig>  <cit> . rna-seq data indicated the majority of cree present in nccp <dig> were near or overlapping srna transcripts, implying cree may be influencing srna expression  <cit> . of the  <dig> cree reported in fa  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> or roughly 30% were located at or near the 5′ end or overlapping the length of the srna .

nrrf regulated fe dependent srnas
we identified five potential trans-acting srnas as being regulated by fe availability and at least some component of fe-regulation appeared to be mediated by nrrf . these srnas were additionally subjected to temporal regulation across the growth curve . we designated these fe responsive srnas as nrs ; see table  <dig> for name designation and genomic location. for all determinations of srna transcriptional levels as determined by real time pcr, the complemented nrrf strain lj <dig> expressed levels similar to wt . three srnas have been reported in gonococcal strain ms <dig>  <cit> . nrsa  and nrsd  were found to be highly expressed in fe-replete growth conditions with transcript lengths of  <dig> and 191 bps respectively  <cit> . the transcript lengths estimated from northern blot analysis in fa  <dig> were similar, 243 bp for nrsa and 193 bp for nrsd . nrsb  was also highly expressed in ms <dig>  <cit>  with the 5′ end of this 404 bp transcript located antisense to a 98 bp region of the 3′ end of ngo_ <dig> in fa  <dig>  nrsb is a 145 bp transcript downstream of ngo_ <dig> with primer extension results corresponding to the tss suggested by rockhopper analysis . novel transcripts nrsc and nrse were 174 bp and 178 bp respectively as estimated by northern blot analysis .fig.  <dig> temporal expression of fe regulation in nrs srnas. the levels of expression of nrs srnas in fa  <dig> compared to the mutant strain beginning at 3 h for nrsa, nrsb, and nrsd; 4 h or 5 h for nrse, and nrsc. expression continued to increase at subsequent time points according to real time pcr fold change results a-e). values reported are means from three separate growth curves ± sem at  <dig> , <dig>  and 5 h. asterisks indicate a significant difference in fold change values of each nrs srna in fa  <dig> and in nrrf mutant strain

relative concentration of nrs srna transcriptional levels was assessed in the wt and mutant strain when fe was restricted. in the nrrf mutant there was a significant increase in transcription compared to wt in nrsb, nrsc, nrsd, and nrse  beginning at early stationary phase. increased expression of nrsa in absence of nrrf was seen as early as 2 h . these data indicate that reduced expression of nrs transcripts was relieved during fe restriction in the nrrf mutant. intarna analysis of rna-rna interactions  <cit>  using nrrf as the query and nrs srnas to determine potential targets, suggested regions of complementary sequence between nrrf and each nrs srna that were energetically favorable . using rnafold  <cit>  to predict the secondary structure of these regulatory srnas suggested that the base-pairing of nrrf with each nrs srna was within an accessible region .fig.  <dig> relative expression of nrrf regulated fe dependent nrs srnas. the relative concentration of nrs srnas was assessed by real time pcr in wt strain fa  <dig> and nrrf mutant strain lj <dig> in fe restricted growth conditions. values reported are means from three separate growth curves ± sem at  <dig> , <dig>  and 5 h. relative concentration significantly increased in the mutant strain compared to wt for nrs srnas, with increased levels at late log and as early as 2 h a-e). *difference in relative concentration between fa  <dig> and nrrf mutant were significant at 




regulation by nrrf may not fully explain the temporal regulation when fe is present and nrrf transcription levels are low. progressive increases in the transcription of nrs srnas began at late log and continued into stationary phase as evidenced by increasing fold change values as determined by real time pcr . moreover; the nrrf null mutant strain lj <dig> exhibited a significant reduction in fold change as was evident at  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 h for nrsa, nrsb, and nrsd  and beginning at 4 h and 5 h, respectively for nrsc and nrse . nrrf regulation of these fe-induced srnas through potential binding targets, or indirectly by additional regulators dependent on the availability of fe in the organisms remains to be determined.

conservation of iron-regulated srna in neisseriaceae
the neisseriaceae include commensal organisms commonly found on mammals as normal flora, in addition to the human pathogens n. gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis. to determine if the fe regulated srnas reported in this study were shared by members of this family, we used blastn to query  <dig> genomes comprising complete and draft genome sequences available at ncbi . sequences with a cut-off value of 85% length and 85% sequence identity for each fe-regulated srna query were retained, resulting in  <dig> neisseria sp. genomes with homology to one or more of the srnas . a heat map was constructed to cluster the fe-regulated srnas in the commensal and pathogenic neisseria sp. . red indicates the presence of the srna while black denotes the absence. a larger version of this heat map that can more clearly visualize strain names is provided in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  the  <dig> neisseria sp genomes could be grouped into  <dig> clusters using hierarchical clustering . nrs srnas and the majority of the nrf srnas were not found in cluster  <dig>  which included n. cinerea n. flavescens, n. macacae, n. mucosa, and n. sicca. the n. meningitidis genomes in cluster 3b appear to have a heterogeneous cluster pattern for the nrrf regulated nrsa srna and several srnas in the nrf srna group . n. lactamica and n. polysaccharea genomes present in cluster 3a were more similar to the srna content in n. meningitidis .fig.  <dig> heat map comparing fe regulated srnas in fa  <dig> to the neisseriaceae family. this heat map is color-coded: red representing the presence of the srna and black indicating the srna was absent. hierarchical clustering analysis of the  <dig> fe-regulated srna in  <dig> complete and draft genomes revealed four clusters. cluster a was a small group of draft commensal genomes with limited homology to nrf srnas. commensals in cluster 3a showed a similar pattern of srna expression as cluster 3b containing the bulk of the meningococcal genomes. gonococcal genomes were represented in cluster  <dig> with nrsd, nrse and nrfg found only in n. gonorrhoeae. a larger version of this figure is provided in additional file 10: figure s <dig> to visualize neissericeae genome names




compared to the diverse pattern seen in cluster  <dig>  all nrs and nrf srnas were present in n. gonorrhoeae complete reference genomes with a majority present in the draft genomes . two nrrf regulated nrs srnas, nrsd, nrse, and fe-regulated nrfg appear to be gonococcal specific . nrfd , nrfh, and nrsa are restricted to the pathogenic neisseria; with nrff, antisense to the protease subunit of the lon protease, conserved in commensal and pathogenic neisseria sp. .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, deep sequencing of directional srna libraries was utilized to assess srna expression relative to regulation by fe and temporally across the growth curve; identifying  <dig> srnas. of those candidate srnas; at least  <dig> including a sam riboswitch were differentially expressed by the availability of fe, with nrrf regulation of five. nrrf regulated fe-dependent nrs srnas nrsd and nrse; and fe-regulated nrfg were gonococcal specific .

strikingly, nrs srnas  and nrf srnas  were induced in the presence of fe beginning at late log and increasing well into stationary phase with the exception of fe-repressed srna, nrfd . in fact, for several of these fe-induced induced srnas it appears that transcription levels continue to increase to the 5 h time point . growth in stationary phase is tightly regulated as organisms must adapt quickly to survive in stressful conditions  <cit> . in addition to known regulatory mechanisms governing this process  <cit>  in e. coli, srnas have been implicated as regulators in stationary phase  <cit>  as well as biofilm control  <cit> . expression of srnas during stationary phase in other organisms has been reported . for example,  <dig> srna were expressed as the organism entered early stationary phase in salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . in e. coli, the majority of the  <dig> novel srnas identified were present in stationary phase with several reaching the highest expression going into late stationary phase  <cit> . analysis of an extensive tiling array study in n. meningitidis using seven different growth conditions and stresses revealed that the majority of differentially expressed putative srnas were found in stationary phase  <cit> . how potential regulatory strategies for n. gonorrhoeae fe-regulated srnas reported here may operate in the context of the fe-regulon and physiology of the organism transitioning into stationary phase will be of great interest.fig.  <dig> temporal control of fe regulated srnas. real time pcr fold change results for all fe-induced srnas were plotted against a representative example of an fa  <dig> growth curve showing o.d. values across the 5 h time point to demonstrate the temporal increases in nrs srna a) and nrf srnas b). nrfd is not presented here as this srna was fe-repressed and did not demonstrate temporal control
