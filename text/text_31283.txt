BACKGROUND
the complexities of promoter regions are slowly being revealed with help from a series of groundbreaking studies on vast collections of promoter sequences  <cit> . proximal promoter regions  typically contain the features necessary for basal levels of gene expression. within the proximal promoter region, core promoter elements  such as tata, ccaat, the initiator element , tfiib recognition element, downstream promoter element , represent distinct functional entities, along with cpg-islands, responsible for basal promoter activity. computational studies of large collections of promoters classify them by these components, either individually or in combination. thus far discrete functional mechanisms have not been fully elucidated for each class of promoter. however patterns of transcription initiation have been defined for cpg-islands, which are typically broad stretches of dna with numerous start sites, and for tata box motifs, which have single well-defined start sites  <cit> .

a relatively new category of promoters comprises bidirectional promoters. these regulatory regions fall between two genes and regulate transcription of the genes in opposite directions from the promoter region, i.e. the bidirectional nature contrasts that of a typical uni-directional promoter. these promoters represent a subclass of the larger gene of promoter sequences  <cit> . previous studies have shown that bidirectional promoters are enriched in the genome  <cit>  , tend to be co-expressed  <cit>  and bind ets proteins  <cit> . one approach to elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating bidirectional promoters is to map the content of cpes. since co-expression of both genes happens more frequently than random events  <cit> , an explanatory model would suggest symmetry of the promoter elements near the tsss. this manuscript addresses the distribution of cpes in the human bidirectional promoters using computational analyses of current large-scale experimental datasets as well as motif analyses. we address the issues of c+g content, patterns of transcription initiation and symmetry of cpes near the tsss.

RESULTS
core promoter elements
tata box
the earliest descriptions of functional promoter elements focused on the importance of a tata-motif to recruit the essential rna polymerase ii molecule to the transcription start site . we now understand that the tata-centric view of promoters represents only a minor proportion of promoters in eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

by scanning non-bidirectional and bidirectional promoters , we found that 29% of non-bidirectional promoters and 9% of bidirectional promoters contained a tata motif. this result was consistent with previous reports  <cit> , which suggested that the tata occurrence was depleted in bidirectional promoters compared to the genome average. the prevalence of tata motifs in non-bidirectional promoters was statistically significant over that expected by chance; however, in bidirectional promoters did not vary significantly from the rate expected by chance. reducing the range of the searchable window to a region  surrounding the - <dig> position, which is essential for proper tata-box function , we found that the occurrence of tata boxes decreased to  <dig> % for non-bidirectional promoters and  <dig> % for bidirectional promoters, respectively . the tata motifs peaked at the functional location  in both the non-bidirectional and bidirectional promoters. by this approach, the presence of the tata motif in both types of promoters was significantly larger than expected by random chance, which occurred at  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively. thus searching only the known functional position of the motif filtered out a majority of false positive predictions. although the tata motif in bidirectional promoters was lower than the genome-average, it was clearly present in a select group of bidirectional promoters. of these, the data showed a strong enrichment for histone genes. a p-value for enrichment was  <dig> e- <dig> compared to a random set of sequences.

downstream promoter element 
dpe is a downstream promoter element that is conserved from drosophila to human  <cit> . the dpe motif is usually located at the downstream position + <dig> relative to the transcription start site. we found that  <dig> % of bidirectional promoters and  <dig> % of non-bidirectional promoters contained this motif at the functional position . the presence of dpe in both type of promoters was significantly larger than expected by random chance, which was 15% and 16% , respectively.

inr element
the inr  <cit>  is a conserved sequence that encompasses the tss, which functions to direct accurate transcription initiation either by itself or in conjunction with tata or dpe. we found that  <dig> % of bidirectional promoters contain the inr motif while  <dig> % of non-bidirectional promoters contained this motif at the functional position . the presence of the inr in both type of promoters was significantly larger than the frequency expected by random chance, which was  <dig> %% and  <dig> %% , respectively.

tfllb recognition element 
the bre is located immediately upstream of tata box  <cit>  of some promoters containing tata. we found that  <dig> % of bidirectional and  <dig> % of non-bidirectional promoters contained this motif at the functional position . the presence of bre in both types of promoters was significantly larger than the frequency expected by random chance, which was  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively.

ccaat
the ccaat motif represents a consensus sequence that occurs upstream of the tss by 75â€“ <dig> bases. we found that  <dig> % of bidirectional promoters contain ccaat element while  <dig> % of non-bidirectional promoters contained this motif at the functional position . presence of ccaat in both types of promoters was significantly larger than frequency expected by random chance  <dig> % and  <dig> % .

c+g content and cpg-islands
promoters have high c+g contents compared to the other noncoding regions such as the intergenic regions between the 3' ends of genes i.e., tail_to_tail regions . the average percentage of c+g nucleotides in bidirectional promoters, non-bidirectional promoters and tail-to-tail regions was 64%, 55% and 45%, respectively. the c+g percentage of each category  showed that  <dig> % of bidirectional promoters had c+g content exceeding 60%, while only  <dig> % of tail-to-tail regions had c+g content exceeding 60%. consistent with a high c+g content, bidirectional promoters had a significant enrichment of cpg-islands . cpg-islands were present in 90% of bidirectional promoters compared to 45% of non-bidirectional promoters and only 9% of tail-to-tail regions.

the correspondence between cpg-islands and gene expression was measured for bidirectional promoters and non-bidirectional promoters . in  <dig> human tissues of blood-cell identity, 31% of genes with bidirectional, cpg-island promoters had higher expression than the median data from  <dig>  genes in  <dig> tissues. a slightly lower percentage of 24% was recorded for genes with non-bidirectional, cpg-island promoters . in contrast, only 14% of genes lacking cpg-islands showed expression above the median value  . the percentage of genes with lower than median expression values were 11%, 18% and 24% for bidirectional promoters and non-bidirectional promoters containing cpg-islands and non-bidirectional promoters lacking cpg-islands, respectively. thus the presence of a cpg-island corresponded to a trend toward higher gene expression from bidirectional promoters.

chip-seq data
increasingly, high-throughput experimental studies are providing a wealth of information that is useful for deducing biologically relevant themes. assays such as chip-chip or chip-seq are powerful investigative tools for revealing the presence of a protein bound to dna. the cost and labor involved with such studies are large; however the significance of these experimental results far exceeds any other method for obtaining binding information at this scale. for example, chip-chip data revealed the binding of rna polymerase ii at the collection of active promoters in the cell, providing a snapshot of the inner workings of the cell  <cit> . we used the chip-seq data of barski et al.  <cit>  for rna polymerase ii to determine which promoters were occupied by the transcription machinery.

these data showed that the occupancy of rna polymerase ii was over 2-fold greater at bidirectional promoters than at non-bidirectional promoters. this result is consistent with the idea of two active transcription forks in the bidirectional promoter region. moreover, the data suggested that these regions recruited rna pol ii efficiently. the higher proportion of expression values in cpg-island bidirectional promoters compared to noncpg-island promoters  was consistent with the higher recruitment of rna polii shown here by the chip-seq data . a slightly higher number of poill tags appeared at the negative strand genes than the positive strand genes in the bidirectional gene pairs. this observation prompted the analysis of core promoter elements  in both negative strand genes and positive strand genes . most elements were simultaneously represented at the left and right tsss. notably, nonbidirectional promoters contained a larger than expected proportion of promoters with no core promoter elements .

asymmetry of tata occurrence in bidirectional promoters
we mapped all bidirectional promoter regions for the presence of tata motifs with respect to the left and right tsss. only one regulatory region had a tata motif on the left and right sides at the correct positions . this result indicated an asymmetry of regulatory elements utilizing tata motifs in bidirectional promoters . furthermore, we looked the occurrence of other cpes at the tata-depleted tss . all forms of cpe elements were found at the tata depleted tsss; showing no balanced counterpart to the tata motif.

cage
recently sets of transcripts with precise initiation sites have been produced and mapped onto their positions in the genome. this experimental technique, known as cap-trapping or cage <cit> , precisely defines tsss by capturing all transcripts at their first nucleotide . this cap is "worn" at the beginning of the transcript, which corresponds to the "head" or beginning of the gene. data generated by cap-trapping assays promise to significantly advance our knowledge of the transcriptome in any given cell type, refine our knowledge of the start sites of genes, and, by inference, pave the way for promoter analyses  that examine the sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the captured tsss.

the bidirectional promoter dataset was validated by cage experimental evidence. the main peak of cage tags occurred at the mapped tsss for bidirectional promoters of negative and positive strand genes . additional short peaks in the cage  data indicated that a few minor initiation sites were present. in contrast to the characterized, broad patterns of initiation at cpg-island promoters  <cit> , bidirectional promoters have very distinct sites of initiation. mapping the number of paired  transcripts, we found evidence for  <dig> co-expressed genes out of  <dig>  gene pairs.

CONCLUSIONS
bidirectional promoters comprise a diverse set of core-promoter regulatory elements. a subset of these promoters contain tata motifs, with notable enrichment at histone promoters. we did not find a balanced representation of tata at both the left and right tsss of gene pairs, including the histone genes. this result indicated that bidirectional promoters can employ different methods of regulation within a pair of genes. furthermore, we found that 45% of genes were co-expressed â€“ by virtue of the cage tags. this approach excluded signals from downstream alternative promoters, which complicate measurements in microarray analyses; confirm that a large proportion of these promoters are co-expressed from the neighbouring tsss. bidirectional promoters coincided with cpg-islands more often than non-bidirectional promoters. this genomic feature may play a significant role in marking these regions as promoters as well as participating in pol ii recruitment.
