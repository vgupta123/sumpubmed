BACKGROUND
two principal mechanisms, with overlapping components, exist to protect plants from infection. pattern triggered immunity  involves the recognition of conserved, indispensible microbial structures, such as flagellin. these microbe associated molecular patterns  are recognised by pattern recognition receptors  such as fls <dig>  which recognizes flagellin, and stimulate a signalling network to elaborate an appropriate defence. in order to break free of this basal immune response adapted pathogens must produce and deliver effectors capable of disarming the plants surveillance and countermeasures. the second mechanism of protection therefore is effector triggered immunity  whereby plants monitor effectors or their targets with resistance  gene products. recognition of pathogen effectors again stimulates a signalling network with many elements common to that of pti but with typically more drastic consequences  <cit> . plant hormones play critical roles in the signalling following both pti and eti, with salicylic acid  central in mediating protection against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . salicylic acid accumulates both locally and systemically following infection and is essential for establishment of systemic acquired resistance  and the development of durable, broad spectrum resistance against normally virulent pathogens  <cit> .

for both eti and pti the accumulation and action of sa is dependent on several shared components. in arabidopsis thaliana the eds1/pad <dig> node lies upstream of sa biosynthesis, as the two interacting proteins are essential for activation of the sa signalling sector  <cit> . sid <dig> has been identified as a critical component in the biosynthesis of sa in response to biotic challenge; sid <dig> encodes an isochorismate synthase capable of catalysing the formation of the sa precursor isochorismate from chorismate  <cit> . also critical for the accumulation of sa is the mate transporter eds <dig>  which may be involved in the transport of a biosynthetic precursor of sa  <cit> . downstream of sa biosynthesis, npr <dig> is involved in the activation of sa-dependent gene expression. suitably high sa levels and appropriate redox conditions result in npr <dig> monomerisation allowing it to enter the nucleus and interact with transcription factors of the tga family  <cit> . recent studies have identified either npr <dig> or the paralogs npr <dig> and npr <dig> as sa receptors  <cit> . wu et al. showed that the interaction of sa and npr <dig> produced a conformational change allowing the npr <dig> btb/poz domain to interact with tga <dig>  while fu et al. did not observe sa binding by npr <dig> they showed that npr <dig> and npr <dig> could act as sa-dependent adapters for the proteasomal degradation of npr <dig> whose different affinity for sa subtly modulates the response to different sa concentrations.

with sid <dig> occupying a critical role in the transduction of defence signalling through sa, much effort has been made to understand its regulation. positive regulators of sid <dig> expression have been identified, such as wrky <dig> which has been shown to bind to the sid <dig> promoter and induce sid <dig> expression in transfection assays. electrophoretic mobility shift assays  revealed that wrky <dig> bound to a modified version of the consensus w-box motif that retains the tgac core  <cit> . negative regulators of sid <dig> expression have also been uncovered; ein <dig> has been shown to bind to the sid <dig> promoter and combined mutations of ein <dig> and its close homolog eil <dig> showed elevated sid <dig> expression, sa accumulation and increased resistance to bacterial infection  <cit> . similarly, three related nac transcription factors  were found to inhibit sid <dig> expression, sa accumulation and resistance to bacterial infection with anac <dig> shown to bind to the sid <dig> promoter  <cit> .

two further genes involved in the regulation of sid <dig> are cbp60g and sard <dig>  cbp60g is a member of a family of calmodulin  binding proteins that was identified as being strongly induced in response to mamps treatment. plants carrying cbp60g null mutations were compromised in the induction of sid <dig> and accumulation of sa  <cit> . cbp60g was shown to bind cam in a ca2+ dependent fashion; cbp60g transgenes with mutations in the cam binding domain that abolished the cam interaction were incapable of complementing the null mutant. independently, the closest homolog of cbp60g was identified in a screen for mutants defective in systemic acquired resistance and named sard <dig>  <cit> . sard <dig>  while more closely related to cbp60g than the rest of the cbp <dig> family, does not bind cam  <cit> . both cbp60g and sard <dig> were impaired in sar with the double mutant more strongly affected  <cit> . lines over-expressing sard <dig> accumulated more sa than wildtype plants  <cit>  while the double knockout mutant was severely compromised in sa accumulation in response to infection  <cit> . both cbp60g and sard <dig> were shown to bind to the promoter of sid <dig> and in emsa experiments a central dna binding domain of both proteins was found to bind to an oligomer with the sequence gaaattttgg selected from the sid <dig> promoter  <cit> . cbp60g and sard <dig> have partially redundant function in sa signalling with both mutants affecting sa accumulation and pathogen growth but the double mutant exhibiting a greater than additive effect  <cit> . while clearly overlapping in function there are a variety of distinctions in addition to the requirement of cam binding: cbp60g appears to have more influence over the early events in defence signalling with sard <dig> playing a more prominent role later; mamps triggered signalling is more greatly affected by the loss of cbp60g than the loss of sard <dig>  <cit> . at the transcriptomic level the expression fingerprint of cbp60g more closely resembles that of sid <dig> than sard <dig> does during mamps responses while the trend was reversed later time-points with virulent bacterial infection  <cit> .

while the cbp60g sard <dig> mutant drastically reduces sid <dig> expression and sa accumulation upon biotic challenge the double mutant is more susceptible to pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola es <dig>  than sid2- <dig> indicating a role for cbp60g and sard <dig> in sa-independent defence signalling  <cit> . potential targets for cbp60g sard <dig> regulation were identified using a custom microarray where  <dig> genes  including sid <dig> were down-regulated in the double mutant. analysis of the promoters of these genes found a significant enrichment of a gaaattt motif, a fragment of the oligomer used in zhang et al.’s emsa study. similarly zhang et al. noted an enrichment of aatttt motifs in genes up-regulated in other pti and eti studies.

with the advent of whole genome transcriptional profiling many studies have made use of the abundance of microarray data to identify new pathway components based on their co-expression with known elements. for example, additional enzymes involved in cellulose synthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis were uncovered based on their correlation with known genes across publicly available array data  <cit> . this type of analysis has also uncovered new regulatory elements controlling glucosinolate biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . in fact it was co-expression analysis that first uncovered the regulation of sid <dig> by wrky <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the correlation between sid <dig> and wrky <dig> was only observed when restricted to a subset of array experiments involving stress treatments. given the enrichment of putative cbp60g sard <dig> motifs within the sample of genes down-regulated in cbp60g sard <dig> plants we decided to use co-expression analysis to expand this subset and search for similar motif enrichment in order to identify additional potential targets for cbp60g sard <dig> control and additional components of the signalling network.

RESULTS
expression patterns of cbp60g, sard <dig>  and sid <dig> are correlated
our previous work suggested that cbp60g plays a greater role than sard <dig> during a mamp response, while the reverse is true during the response to pma es <dig>  to test for a similar effect in the relationship of the expression levels of cbp60g and sard <dig> to that of sid <dig>  we monitored expression of these three genes following infiltration of leaves with the flagellin fragment flg <dig> or pma es <dig>  sampling every hour for the first  <dig> h following infection followed by a final sampling at  <dig> h. figure  <dig> shows that following flg <dig> treatment, cbp60g induction precedes sard <dig> induction, with expression of cbp60g already significantly up-regulated at  <dig> h, and maintaining a stronger fold-induction throughout the time course. the expression profile of cbp60g is closely mirrored by that of sid <dig> with the slight difference that cbp60g induction is more rapidly activated. accordingly, the pearson’s correlation for the similarity between the cbp60g and sid <dig> expression patterns was high  compared to the sard1:sid <dig> correlation . a different pattern was observed following inoculation with pma es <dig>  while cbp60g is again faster to respond to infection, from 3h sard <dig> up-regulation matches that of cbp60g and then exceeds it from 8h onwards. the later elevation of sard <dig> transcription more closely matches that of sid <dig> than cbp60g. the correlation values are reversed relative to flg <dig> inoculation, at  <dig>  for cbp60g:sid <dig> and  <dig>  for sard1:sid <dig>  these results are consistent with the idea that cbp60g has a greater effect than sard <dig> on sid <dig> expression using a mamps response, while the reverse is true during response to pma es <dig> 

selection of data sets for defining the cbp60g/sard <dig> regulon
we hypothesized that genes under the control of cbp60g and sard <dig> could be identified by mining public gene expression data for genes co-expressed with the  <dig> genes whose expression was found to be suppressed in cbp60g, sard <dig> or cbp60g sard <dig> mutant plants using a small defence-related custom microarray . to do this, we wanted to select an appropriate set of data, as inclusion of many experiments in which defence genes are not induced is likely to increase the noise in the analysis. for example, the relationship between wrky <dig> and sid <dig> was only observed in a subset of the attedii co-expression database restricted to stress-associated profiling experiments and excluding other data  <cit> . we collected data from  <dig> expression profiling experiments conducted using the affymetrix ath <dig> arabidopsis array, with treatments related to pathogen infection, stress responses, hormone treatment or associated mutations, and developmental series. the experiments ranged in size from six to several hundred arrays. data from each experiment were processed identically; a conservative approach was taken to quality control with any outlying arrays being removed prior to batch normalization and summarization by rma. in each experiment, the spearman rank correlation coefficients for cbp60g:sid <dig> and sard1:sid <dig> were calculated along with the associated p-value for significance of correlation. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  in many experiments, both correlations are similarly strong, but there are also experiments in which only cbp60g or only sard <dig> is strongly correlated with sid <dig>  in several experiments where a mamps elicitor is applied the correlation between cbp60g and sid <dig> is greater than the correlation between sard <dig> and sid <dig>  for example in the experiment marked   seedlings were treated with flg <dig>  the bacterial protein hrpz, the fungal protein npp <dig> or a preparation of bacterial lipopolysacharrides, the cbp60g correlation is  <dig>  while the sard <dig> correlation is  <dig> . similarly in   with treatments of flg <dig> and the plant-derived danger signal oligogalacturonides the cbp60g correlation is  <dig>  while the sard <dig> correlation is  <dig> . however, not all mamp treatment experiments gave rise to the same discrimination, in   treatment with fungal-derived chitin fragments produce equally strong correlations for both cbp60g and sard <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. other experiments which exhibited stronger cbp60g sid <dig> correlation included experiments investigating plastid function. in   null mutations in the plastid biogenesis component sco <dig> produce a cbp60g correlation of  <dig>  while the sard <dig> correlation was  <dig> . the impact of excess light or application of an electron transport inhibitor in   also resulted in a specific cbp60g:sid <dig> correlation,  <dig>  compared with  <dig>  for sard <dig>  array experiments where a stronger sard1:sid <dig> correlation was observed included:  phytophthora parasitica infection of roots;  combined mutations in aba signalling and sa biosynthesis;  mutations in the exocycst component exo70a1;  comparisons of potassium starvation and caesium toxicity . while there are interesting trends in the specific, discriminatory associations between cbp60g or sard <dig> and sid <dig> there are not currently sufficient datasets to construct specific co-expression networks. in the majority of experiments where cbp60g or sard <dig> was strongly and significantly correlated with sid <dig> the homolog was also positively correlated, providing a sufficiently large dataset to form robust co-expression networks. based on these results, we decided to use the  <dig> experiments, comprising  <dig>  arrays, in which either cbp60g or sard <dig> showed a strong and significant correlation with sid <dig> of at least  <dig>  and a p-value of no more than  <dig> .

some clusters of genes co-expressed with cbp60g/sard1-dependent genes have promoters enriched with gaaatt motifs
we reasoned that by clustering genes with expression patterns similar to the  <dig> genes that showed reduced expression in cbp60g, sard <dig>  or cbp60g sard <dig> plants, we might identify additional defence genes whose expression levels are controlled by cbp60g and/or sard <dig>  prior to clustering, we explored different criteria for selection of co-expressed genes. we used spearman’s rank correlation as a measure of similarity, and determined the number of probesets obtained using different cut-off values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . for each set of genes obtained, we counted the numbers of gaaatt motifs in their promoters. previous promoter analysis of differentially expressed genes had scored gaaattt as the most significant sub-component of the cbp60g sard <dig> binding motif  <cit> . however, in pilot clustering analysis and in all subsequent analyses the shortened gaaatt motif was found to have greater statistical over-representation in clusters containing sid <dig> . hence we used the gaaatt motif rather than the longer gaaattt motif to evaluate the various thresholds and clustering metrics for analysis. the  <dig>  correlation cut-off was clearly too stringent, as it identified  <dig> probesets, only  <dig> more than the  <dig> used to begin the analysis. the  <dig>  cut-off identified  <dig> probesets, with  <dig>  motifs per gene. this seemed a reasonably stringent criterion, and we used these  <dig> probesets for one clustering analysis - experiment # <dig>  when the correlation cut-off was relaxed to  <dig> ,  <dig> probesets were identified, albeit with a lower average density of motifs per gene of  <dig> . however, these included many corresponding to genes with  <dig> or more motifs in their promoters, suggesting that the  <dig>  cut-off may exclude some potential targets for cbp60g sard <dig> regulation. we used this larger set for a second clustering analysis - experiment # <dig> 

for both clustering experiments, we used dpclus  <cit>  to identify densely interconnected nodes within the co-expression network with connections being defined as correlations of  <dig>  or greater for experiment # <dig> and  <dig>  or greater for experiment # <dig>  the generation of clusters was constrained by a threshold for the minimum density of connections within a cluster and a parameter controlling the periphery tracking of clusters such that sparsely connected nodes would be ejected from a cluster even if the average connection density passed the threshold. these two parameters affect the clustering resolution and the capacity to distinguish sub-networks within the co-expression network. overlapping clusters could be formed permitting one gene node to span multiple clusters while some sparsely connected genes could be excluded from all clusters. various parameters were tested and the cluster or clusters containing sid <dig> evaluated. in each instance the gaaatt motif was significantly over-represented in the sid <dig> cluster and parameters that gave rise to the maximum statistical significance observed were chosen for the final analysis – a minimum density value of  <dig>  and a cp threshold of  <dig> .

the sid <dig> clusters are enriched for gaaatt motifs and defence genes
as sid <dig> has been reported to be a direct target of cbp60g and sard <dig>  we studied the clusters containing sid <dig> more closely. in experiment # <dig>  sid <dig> is in cluster  <dig>  the internal structure of this cluster is shown in figure 4a. it includes five genes in addition to sid2: the density of connections for the cluster is  <dig> and the gene most strongly co-expressed with sid <dig> is cml <dig>  cml <dig> and cml <dig> are two members of a gene family encoding calmodulin-like proteins containing calcium binding ef-hand domains. they are phylogenetically closely related to a third family member not represented on the ath <dig> array, cml <dig> <cit> . sard <dig> is contained in this cluster  alongside a putative heavy-metal transporter and agp <dig>  of the five genes linked to sid <dig> only agp <dig> was present on the custom array used to seed this analysis. as shown in figure 4b, analysis of the gaaatt motif in the promoters of these genes by pobo shows that enrichment of this motif is highly significant   <cit> . qpcr confirmed that expression of all cluster members was induced in response to infection with pma es <dig>  this induction was significantly suppressed in the cbp60g sard <dig> mutant for agp <dig>  at5g <dig> and cml47; cml <dig> expression was lower in the double mutant but with a high p-value of  <dig>  . intriguingly, cml <dig>  the nearest homolog of cml <dig> and cml <dig>  is up-regulated in response to pma es <dig> and this induction is significantly enhanced in cbp60g sard <dig> plants .

in the expanded clustering of experiment # <dig> sid <dig> is also present in only one cluster – cluster  <dig>  figure 5a shows that the sid <dig> cluster from experiment # <dig> contains all the genes from the more stringent analysis but is much larger, comprising  <dig> probesets. the pobo analysis shown in figure 5b indicates that the enrichment of the gaaatt motif remains highly significant in this cluster. sid <dig> and cml <dig> are the cluster members with the highest gaaatt motif density with  <dig> motifs while arck <dig>  a receptor-like kinase involved in suppressing aba responses has  <dig>  <cit> . qpcr was used to investigate the impact of the cbp60g sard <dig> double mutation on two of the genes with gaaatt rich promoters not previously identified as being involved in defence, arck <dig> and the phospholipase at4g <dig> . in addition to both sard <dig> probesets and cbp60g, this cluster also includes many genes known to play important roles in plant defence because loss-of-function mutations compromise resistance. these include pad <dig> <cit> , eds <dig> <cit> , adr1-l <dig> <cit> , sobir <dig> <cit>  and wrky <dig> <cit> . the cluster was significantly enriched for genes with known or putative receptor kinase function and genes implicated in calcium signalling when compared to all the probesets on the array using the mapman over-representation tool . the heavy-metal transporter gene from the experiment # <dig> sid <dig> cluster was joined by a neighbouring close homolog. three genes in the cluster were predicted to contain ankyrin repeats.

all  <dig> members of the cluster tested by qpcr were found to be up-regulated in response to bacterial infection in a cbp60g sard <dig> dependent fashion except cml <dig> . while some cluster members may prove to be targets for cbp60g sard <dig> regulation, genetic analysis and transcriptome profiling has placed other components  upstream of cbp60g and sard <dig> in the immune signalling pathway, thus the co-expression network reveals multiple stages in the control of sa mediated defence signalling. both eds <dig> and pad <dig> have previously been characterised as sa inducible and their roles in the feed-forward loop amplifying sa signals may best explain their co-expression with sid <dig> <cit> .

other motifs were observed to be over-represented within this cluster in addition to gaaatt. a cct n <dig> tcc dyad was over-abundant while the cct or tcc submotifs or the dyad with any intervening length other than  <dig> were all under-represented . this motif was found in the sard <dig> promoter close to the transcription start site.  <dig> of the  <dig> cct n <dig> tcc motifs present in the cluster fall in the proximal  <dig> bp of the  <dig> bp promoter, a significant bias when compared with the genome distribution by fisher’s exact test  . no such bias was observed for gaaatt position or strand in any cluster. various permutations of the consensus wrky transcription factor binding site w-box and the w-like box described in  <cit>  were also observed to be enriched in the sid <dig> cluster .

genes in other clusters enriched for gaaatt motifs are suppressed, induced or unaffected by the cbp60g sard <dig> mutant
expanding the analysis to other clusters with a significant over-representation of the gaaatt motif  uniformly identified pathogen inducible gene expression . however, while some representative  genes from gaaatt-rich clusters, for example cluster  <dig>  were demonstrated to be cbp60g sard <dig> dependent for their full induction by qpcr  or already known to be so from the custom microarray study  other gaaatt rich cluster members, for example cngc <dig> from cluster  <dig>  were found to be induced in a cbp60g sard <dig> independent fashion. since gaaatt is a commonly occurring motif in arabidopsis promoters small clusters when repeatedly sampled with replacement by pobo may be unduly skewed by the presence of one or two genes with a large number of motifs.

one larger cluster, cluster  <dig> with  <dig> genes enriched with gaaatt motifs, was found to contain cbp60g alongside multiple vesicle trafficking components, including some shown to be important for sa homeostasis  <cit> . however, no cbp60g sard <dig> dependent expression was observed for syp <dig> or snap <dig> . w-boxes and another motif, aagtc, were both observed with significant over-representation in this cluster and may better explain potential co-regulation within the cluster . another cluster representing genes of clearly linked function was cluster  <dig>  containing the pathogen responsive genes pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pnp-a. however, while pr <dig> has previously been shown to require cbp60g and sard <dig> for full induction, pr <dig> was not significantly affected.

in some instances the gaaatt rich gene selected to monitor a given cluster was found to be up-regulated in the cbp60g sard <dig> double mutant relative to wildtype e.g. at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  this phenomenon was observed in several members of cluster  <dig> with pbp <dig> having a significantly enhanced response to infection in the double mutant while at5g <dig> and at2g <dig> were up-regulated in the mock inoculated mutants. intriguingly for mpk <dig>  which encodes a map kinase activated during pti  <cit> , both a significantly suppressed pathogen response and elevated basal expression were observed in the mutant.

wrky28:sid <dig> co-expression occurs in a subset of the conditions included in this analysis
prior co-expression analysis of biotic stress microarray data had uncovered the regulation of sid <dig> by wrky <dig> and the regulation of sa biosynthesis component pbs <dig> by wrky <dig> <cit> . while wrky <dig> clustered with sid <dig>  the proposed downstream target for wrky <dig>  pbs <dig> does not co-cluster with wrky <dig>  similarly, wrky <dig> was not found to be robustly co-expressed with sid <dig> in this study and was not included in the  <dig> genes selected for analysis in experiment # <dig>  in the selected dataset of  <dig> arrays wrky <dig> ranks as the1775th most closely correlated gene with sid <dig> with a spearman rank coefficient of  <dig> . the modified w-box motif identified through emsa as the binding site for wrky <dig> is enriched in cluster  <dig> but weakly in comparison with other motifs investigated . to identify conditions responsible for the previously reported wrky28:sid <dig> co-expression, microarray studies with a significant wrky28:sid <dig> correlation were plotted alongside cbp60g:sid <dig> and sard1:sid <dig> correlations in a heatmap . the association of wrky <dig> and sid <dig> comprised a subset of the studies with significant cbp60g or sard <dig> co-expression. however, analysis of the  <dig> experiments comprising  <dig> arrays where wrky28:sid <dig> expression is significant and greater than  <dig>  still resulted in a stronger association between cbp60g or sard <dig> and sid <dig> than wrky <dig> and sid <dig> with wrky <dig> only rising to become the 69th gene most closely correlated with sid <dig> 

discussion
the various strands of evidence pointing to the discriminatory action of the partially redundant cbp60g and sard <dig> in mediating different aspects of the immune response were reinforced when surveying the microarray datasets . as with the flg <dig> timecourse  a closer association of cbp60g and sid <dig> was observed in several mamps treatment studies and intriguingly, several experiments unrelated to defence. unfortunately, despite the abundance and variety of microarray experiments publicly available there are currently too few to build independent correlation networks for cbp60g and sard <dig>  aoki et al. reported that a minimum of  <dig> arrays is required for stability in the density of gene co-expression networks  <cit>  and the addition of several mamps specific experiments sampling at early time-points would be required to pass this threshold for a distinct cbp60g analysis. the presence of sard <dig> and absence of cbp60g in the sid <dig> cluster with the more stringent correlation threshold of experiment # <dig>  imply that the combined dataset may be weighted towards later timepoints in infection, understandably since these have higher probability of uncovering large scale differential expression in relatively costly gene expression profiling studies. cbp60g has recently been implicated in mediating responses to abiotic stress such as drought  <cit> . whilst many abiotic stress studies were included few passed the threshold for cbp60g or sard <dig> correlation with sid <dig>  closer inspection of two well-characterised studies of drought and osmotic stresses  revealed strong up-regulation of cbp60g in response to stress with only weak sid <dig> response and hence low correlation. a similar pattern was observed in several other experiments with an abiotic stress treatment. preliminary analysis revealed cbp60g to be co-expressed with a subset of the genes from the  <dig> used in experiment # <dig> with sard <dig> co-expressed with only one gene across this dataset . once more information has been uncovered concerning the role of cbp60g in mediating abiotic stress responses, revisiting such a co-expression analysis may prove fruitful.

potentially the most exciting finding from the co-expression analysis of cbp60g and/or sard <dig> and sid <dig> has been the two calmodulin-like genes in the core sid <dig> cluster from experiment # <dig>  their strength of correlation combined with the frequency of gaaatt motifs in both cml <dig> and cml <dig> promoters and their potential for physically interacting with cbp60g makes them ideal candidates for further investigation. while the pathogen associated induction of cml <dig> was dependent on cbp60g and sard <dig> there was but a weak and insignificant impact on cml <dig>  a further distinction between the two is that in the main analysis cbp60g and cml <dig> have a spearman correlation co-efficient of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the abiotic stress data set used in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  whereas between cbp60g and cml <dig> the value falls from  <dig>  to  <dig>  indicating a potential abiotic stress specific role for cml <dig>  the up-regulation of cml <dig>  in cbp60g sard <dig> mutants was also surprising and points to potentially complex interplay of feedback loops in controlling the expression of these putative cbp60g interactors.

zooming out of the core sid <dig> cluster by relaxing the co-expression threshold in experiment # <dig> revealed several more putative targets for cbp60g and sard <dig> regulation. signalling components such as the kinases in this cluster provide key targets for investigating pathogen susceptibility in knock-out mutants as these may lie upstream of key defence responses. cluster  <dig> already includes several genes known to confer resistance to infection. however, several of these  lie upstream of cbp60g and sard <dig> <cit>  and so while their presence in this cluster provides an interesting insight into the various feedback loops that govern their co-expression they will not explain the sid2-independent defence response. two genes affecting pathogen resistance that may be downstream of cbp60g and sard <dig> are sobir <dig> and adr1-l <dig>  sobir <dig> is a negative regulator of defence responses  <cit>  and so a poor candidate but the nb-lrr receptor adr1-l <dig> has been implicated as a positive regulator in the establishment of pti, eti and basal defence against virulent pathogens  <cit> .

outside the clusters containing sid <dig>  cluster  <dig> of experiment # <dig> contains the greatest density of observed cbp60g sard <dig> dependent genes with pbs <dig> and aig <dig>  known from the custom array study, and fmo <dig> and cml <dig> confirmed by qpcr  <cit> . fmo <dig> regulates eds1-dependent, sid2-independent defence signalling, a process inhibited by nudt <dig> the homolog of which, nudt <dig>  is present in this cluster  <cit> .

of the genes whose promoters have abundant gaaatt motifs and which cluster within gaaatt enriched regulons there are perhaps four ways to account for those whose expression are not cbp60g / sard <dig> dependent. firstly, since gaaatt is a relatively abundant sequence within the promoters of arabidopsis genes with an average of close to two motifs per  <dig> bp promoter the chance occurrence of two genes with several motifs within a small cluster of, say, five genes will easily produce false positives. it is however difficult to say how large a cluster should be to be worthy of investigation since at the higher stringency of experiment # <dig> clusters we know to be of interest can be relatively small. a second possibility is that, for cbp60g / sard <dig> function, binding to the gaaatt motif is necessary but not sufficient and additional transcription factors and their binding sites are required for cooperative activation. the heatmap in figure  <dig> implies that wrky <dig> is not essential for such activation. however, the sid <dig> cluster and several other gaaatt rich clusters are enriched with the consensus w-box element for wrky binding. third, for some clusters although gaaatt enrichment may accurately imply cbp60g sard <dig> binding, another transcription factor may exert dominant control over induction in response to biotic challenge. thus the influence of cbp60g and sard <dig> may only be observed when this factor is absent. finally, there are six other members of the cbp <dig> family with as yet no demonstrated dna binding potential but in some instances moderate induction in response to biotic stresses which may potentially interact with some motif similar to the one defined for cbp60g and sard <dig> 

the role of cbp60g and sard <dig> in repressing the expression of genes with multiple gaaatt motifs and co-expression with other gaaatt enriched genes was surprising given our previous finding of a significant under-representation of gaaattt motifs in the promoters of genes up-regulated in the cbp60g sard <dig> double mutant  <cit> . however, such complexity is not without precedence. the calmodulin-regulated transcription factor sr <dig> has been shown to positively regulate cbf <dig> but negatively regulate eds <dig> <cit> . the complexity of ca2+ mediated control over sa-mediated defence signalling is further underlined by the observation that sr <dig> inhibits expression of two important positive regulators upstream of sid <dig>  eds <dig> and ndr <dig>  but also inhibits the negative regulator of sid <dig> expression, ein <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, numerous clusters appear to be enriched for sr <dig> binding sites with some overlapping gaaatt enrichment . cluster  <dig> revealed several genes up-regulated in the absence of cbp60g and sard <dig> and multiple members of this cluster act as inhibitors of defence responses   <cit> . furthermore, pbp <dig> mediates auxin signalling, a potential inhibitor of sa-mediated defence signalling  <cit> . another important defence component in this cluster is mpk <dig>  while mpk <dig> is significantly down-regulated in cbp60g sard <dig> plants  <dig> hpi with pma es <dig>  it may be that the moderate increase in the mock inoculated or basal state is more important since mpk <dig> is activated within minutes of biotic challenge and steady-state transcript levels may be important  <cit> . another feature of this cluster is the significant over-abundance of calcium binding proteins including bon <dig>  bap <dig>  pbp <dig>  cml <dig> and at3g <dig>  along with the calmodulin dependent kinase cpk substrate czf  <cit> . these features combine to make this particular regulon an intriguing target for further investigation.

the process involved in the identification of wrky <dig> as a regulator of sid <dig> led us to expect wrky <dig> would form some part of the sid <dig> cluster. the clear evidence that wrky28’s association with sid <dig> exists as a subset of the conditions under which there is a strong and significant association between cbp60g and / or sard <dig> and sid <dig> implies some specific role for wrky <dig>  however, there was no clear trend in the conditions under which wrky <dig> was correlated with sid <dig>  one trend appearing to emerge from the conditions where sid <dig> was correlated with cbp60g and/or sard <dig> but not wrky <dig> were experiments in which the treatment was an exogenous application of sa or some analogue of sa such as benzothiadiazole ,  <dig> -dichloroanthranilic acid  or  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid . for example, in experiments with exogenous sa application, nascarrays <dig> and nascarrays <dig>  the wrky28:sid <dig> correlation is − <dig>  and  <dig>  while the sard1:sid <dig> correlation is  <dig>  and  <dig> . in experiments with bth application, gse <dig> and nascarrays <dig>  wrky28:sid <dig> correlation scores are − <dig>  and − <dig>  while sard1:sid <dig> scores  <dig>  and  <dig> . in experiment gse <dig>  <cit> , where dca and ina are applied, the scores are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. while these experiments are not sufficient to construct a stable co-expression matrix they suggest a role for sard <dig> in amplifying an existing sa-mediated signal through a feed-forward loop that is independent of wrky <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
co-expression analysis has facilitated the identification of an sa-mediated defence signalling regulon at two different degrees of resolution. the promoters of these genes are enriched for a fragment of an oligomer demonstrated to bind to cbp60g and sard <dig>  indicating that some members of these clusters are likely targets for regulation by cbp60g and sard <dig>  other putative targets have been identified in separate clusters and intriguingly some genes downstream of gaaatt-abundant promoters have been shown to be repressed by cbp60g and sard <dig>  indicating a potentially complex role in the control of defence gene expression responses. this co-expression analysis has also shed light on the relationship between wrky <dig> and sid <dig> which may allow fine-tuning of regulatory models.
