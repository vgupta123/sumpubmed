BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p <dig> aromatase  is a member of a large superfamily of enzymes named cytochrome p <dig>  which are involved in many physiological functions, such as steroid biosynthesis  <cit> . cyp <dig> is a steroidogenic enzyme which catalyses the aromatisation of androgens to estrogens. thus, aromatase activity is essential for maintaining a physiological balance between androgens and estrogens, a critical aspect in the reproductive function of vertebrates; in humans, a p <dig> aromatase mutation leads to sterility  <cit> . for many other vertebrate groups, it as been demonstrated that cyp <dig> plays a key role in sex differentiation  <cit> .

while several cyp <dig> genes are universally distributed, cyp <dig> is so far restricted to the vertebrate lineage. in mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , reptiles  <cit>  and cartilaginous fishes  <cit> , a single gene has been isolated. in most actinopterygii, however, two genes, cyp19a and cyp19b, encode two different transcripts expressed in the ovary and brain respectively  <cit> . linkage data from zebrafish clearly suggests that these two genes are most likely the result of a genome duplication in the ray-finned bony fish lineage  <cit> . despite intensive research, the ancestry of cyp <dig> genes is yet to be deciphered. no orthologue has been described from fully sequenced invertebrate genomes, like drosophila melanogaster, ciona intestinalis or caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . thus, it has been suggested that the cyp <dig> gene arose at the origin of vertebrates  <cit> . nevertheless, there is now strong evidence indicating that these model invertebrate species have experienced extensive gene loss  <cit> . significantly, the estrogen receptor which was thought to have emerged in vertebrate ancestry, has now been documented in the lophotrocozoan protostome aplysia californica  <cit> .

paralogy regions  consist of a series of linked genes  on one chromosome, many of which have linked homologues  on at least another chromosome   <cit> . two main scenarios have been put forward to account for their presence: evolutionary remnants of chromosomal "en bloc" duplications or genome duplication, followed by gene loss and inversions  <cit> ; or they reflect independent tandem duplications of each gene family followed by adaptive groupings of genes on different chromosomes  <cit> . the term "en bloc" duplication is used here in the context described by abi-rached et al.  <cit> . one of the best characterised examples of a paralogon includes the genes around the mhc complex on human chromosome  <dig>  with homologues on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  . despite other views  <cit> , the most recent findings indicate that an ancestral mhc-like region/chromosome duplicated "en bloc" twice in early vertebrate ancestry to yield a four-array paralogon   <cit> . accordingly, vertebrate genes within these regions should have multiple copies  equally related to single invertebrate orthologues  <cit> . however, this is not the case for a substantial proportion of gene families. gene loss, genomic rearrangements and insertions in both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes will obscure the correct evolutionary pattern of gene families within paralogons  <cit> . this is particularly evident for gene families which are vertebrate single copy. if a vertebrate one-member gene family maps to a paralogon and no orthologue is found in invertebrate model species what should we conclude regarding the ancestry of such a gene family? the human cyp <dig> gene follows this pattern. it maps to hsa15q, a region proposed to be part of the mhc-paralogon  <cit>  . this genomic location is highly suggestive for a invertebrate origin of cyp <dig>  nevertheless, since no paralogues are found in other chromosomal regions, it could well be the case of a genomic location with no evolutionary meaning.

phylogenetics, paralogy and comparative genomics can be a particularly powerful tool to address issues of gene ancestry. here, we analysed the evolutionary history of the genes in close physical proximity to the aromatase gene in several vertebrate species . through phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate that the cyp <dig> region was structured most likely by "en bloc" genomic duplication . most importantly, we also determine that this region has retained the same gene content and overall organisation  without any gene insertion in the three lineages. a single inversion of gene order has occurred in the mammalian clade. finally, we describe for the first time an invertebrate cyp <dig> partial sequence from branchiostoma floridae. we propose that the aromatase gene family is much older than previously hinted.

RESULTS
in this study, we sequentially addressed three questions. first, we determined the duplication pattern  of the gene families in close proximity to the human cyp <dig>  a further test analysed the ancestry of the human aromatase genomic location . finally, we investigated the presence of cyp <dig> in other invertebrate species , other than those previously explored.

phylogeny and paralogy
the human cyp <dig> maps to one of the proposed mhc-paralogon regions    <cit> . despite this proposal, no phylogenetic analysis has been performed to confirm that gene families at hsa15q are part of the mhc-paralogon. this strategy aimed at defining the presence/absence of invertebrate orthologues and the duplication timings of the selected gene families . therefore, we undertook the task of analysing the "genomic environment" surrounding the cyp <dig> human gene at hsa15q within a dna sequence of  <dig>  mb . besides the cyp <dig>  eight other orfs are annotated within this dna sequence, corresponding to the following genes: ap4e <dig>  flj <dig>  col, dmxl <dig>  scgiii, mgc <dig>  tmod <dig>  and tmod <dig> . this dna module is outflanked by members of the tropomodulin gene family, tmod <dig> and tmod <dig>  which have been proposed to support the vertebrate genome duplication hypothesis  <cit> . other members of the tmod gene family map to expected regions of mhc paralogy . furthermore, a single orthologue is found in invertebrate species .

we began by investigating the gene complement for each gene family in vertebrate and invertebrate species through blast search. phylogenetic analysis was then performed when no previous study was available to determine duplication timings .

ap4-e1
adaptor protein complexes function as vesicle coat components in different membrane traffic pathways  <cit> . ap4e <dig> is a recently described subunit of a 4th complex  <cit> . up to the present day the ap4e <dig> gene has been found solely in vertebrate genomes. through blast search we have found the first invertebrate sequence in the c. intestinalis genome . as shown in the phylogenetic tree, ciap4e <dig> is basal to the vertebrate genes with  <dig> of bootstrap support . no further homologues were uncovered in vertebrate genomes.

ssc-s2
the orf identified in ensembl as np_ <dig> , presents significant sequence similarity to three other genbank entries. one of those is a novel tumor necrosis factor-α inducible gene, ssc-s <dig>  <cit> , which maps to hsa <dig>  ssc-s <dig> contains a motif in the amino terminus that shows a significant similarity to death effector domain ii of cell death regulatory protein, fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein   <cit> . through phylogenetic analysis we showed these four sequences to be paralogues . the four genes were named as follows: ssc-s2a , ssc-s2b , ssc-s2c  and ssc-s2d . invertebrate orthologues were found in anopheles gambiae, d. melanogaster, c. elegans  and c. intestinalis . the duplication events date to early vertebrate origin, as indicated by the branching pattern of the tree . the invertebrate sequences are basal to the vertebrate genes with a significant bootstrap support . no homologue of ssc-s2a is found in actinopterygii, possibly due to gene loss. additionally, the human genes are all located in regions of mhc paralogy – hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> , as expected from two rounds of "en bloc" duplication in early vertebrate ancestry. however, the tree branching pattern is not of the  type, but sequential which is not in agreement with the "en bloc" scenario.

col
the ensembl annotation identifies this gene as collomin. this as been renamed to colmedin   <cit> . colmedin is a phylogenetically conserved type ii transmembrane protein with collagen repeats and a cysteine-rich olfactomedin domain, with members described in c. elegans , drosophila and vertebrates  <cit> . no orthologue was detected in c. intestinalis. colmedin has been found to be a single-copy gene in several vertebrate species. blast search to danio , fugu and tetraodon genomes uncovered a new colmedin gene, which we name col1b . col1b is a specific paralogue of actinopterygii. the genomic location of this new gene is explained most likely by an extra genome duplication .

dmxl
rab- <dig> is a  <dig> wd domain protein which binds both gdp/gtp exchange protein and gtpase-activating protein for rab <dig> small g protein family  <cit> . these domains are found in a variety of proteins and are likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . it shows a domain structure similar to that of dmxl <dig> which has  <dig> wd domains, and has been renamed dmxl <dig>  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis confirms that both genes are paralogues, with invertebrate sequences basal to vertebrate dmxl <dig> and dmxl <dig> . moreover, dmxl <dig> maps to an expected region of mhc-paralogon in hsa <dig> . thus, the duplication event which originated dmxl <dig> and dmxl <dig> resulted most likely from two rounds of "en bloc" duplications in early vertebrate ancestry.

scgiii
secretogranin iii  is a member of the granin protein family, that is a component of intracellular dense core vesicles. through blast we found this gene family to be restricted to vertebrates .

nm_699205-ppbp
the orf identified in ensembl as nm_ <dig> codes for the hypothetical protein mgc <dig>  sequence features  indicate that it might be involved in cell wall catabolism. the c. elegans orthologue has been named predicted peptidoglycan-binding protein . thus, we named the human gene ppbp <dig>  a second ppbp gene can be found in vertebrate genomes, which we designate ppbp <dig>  the phylogenetic tree indicates that both orfs are paralogues . the second ppbp gene is present in fugu , amphibians and mammals. the tree pattern indicates that a duplication of an ancestral ppbp gene occurred specifically in the vertebrate lineage. moreover, the second gene maps to an expected region of mhc paralogy in the human genome – hsa <dig> 

tmod <dig> and tmod3
popovici et al.  <cit>  proposed that the tmod gene family duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. however, no phylogenetic analysis was performed to support this assumption. in the human genome  <dig> tropomodulin genes have been annotated: tmod <dig> , tmod <dig> , tmod <dig>  and tmod <dig> . in invertebrates a single tropomodulin gene is observed. the phylogenetic analysis by almenar-queralt et al.  <cit>  suggests that tmod <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. nevertheless, the origin of tmod <dig> is still unclear. the genomic location of both tmod <dig> and  <dig> is highly suggestive for a tandem duplication. our phylogenetic analysis, supports this scenario . the duplication event post-dates the divergence of fish and amphibians, since a single tmod2/ <dig> is found in both fugu and tetraodon . on the contrary, xenopus, chicken, mouse and human have two distinct genes  . thus, we propose that a single tropomodulin gene existed in vertebrate ancestry. it duplicated to yield three tmod genes  as a result of "en bloc" duplication . later, a tandem duplication in the ancestor of xenopus, chicken and mammals, originated the tmod <dig> and tmod <dig> genes.

the phylogenetic analysis of the full set of gene families within the human aromatase dna segment, reveals that four of those have specifically duplicated in the vertebrate lineage. only the ssc-2s gene family shows four paralogues. the tree branching pattern is not of the  type  but sequential . this observation has been interpreted as evidence against an "en bloc" scenario  <cit> . thus, the phylogeny  per se does not support the "en bloc" duplications. in this context, the suggested duplicated regions could have resulted from a complex duplication, loss and rearrangement pattern, and not from "en bloc" duplications  <cit> . however, furlong and holland  <cit> , have recently disputed this assumption.

our analysis confirms the previous suggestion by popovici et al.  <cit>  that genes within hsa15q are part of the mhc-paralogon. we find that the paralogues for each gene family map to expected regions of mhc paralogy . that is the case of ssc-2s , dmxl , ppbp  and tmod . the physical proximity between these genes is also observed in other regions of paralogy besides hsa <dig>  for example, paralogues ssc-s2b, ppbp <dig> and tmod <dig> map closely in chromosome  <dig> , while dmxl <dig> and ssc-s2a are separated by just  <dig> kb in chromosome  <dig> . furthermore, of those genes which are found to be single copy in vertebrates, only for cyp <dig> and scgiii we have not found invertebrate orthologues .

comparative genomics
our phylogenetic analysis and paralogy study strongly suggests that the dna segment harbouring the human aromatase gene resulted from an ancestral "en bloc" duplication of the mhc-paralogon. however, the question remains regarding the ancestry of human cyp <dig> genomic location. it could well be case that the human cyp <dig> location is of no relevant evolutionary meaning. in order to explore these possibilities, we compared the gene content and organisation around cyp <dig> genes in three vertebrate species: h. sapiens, t. nigroviridis and x. tropicalis . the comparison indicates a striking pattern of conservation in both gene content and gene order in the three species . no gene insertion occurred since the divergence of these lineages. two genomic events took place: genomic inversion and tandem gene duplication . the dna module containing tmod <dig>  tmod <dig>  ppbp <dig> and scgiii is differently located in both fish/amphibian and humans . by comparing the gene order in the three clades it is possible to infer the ancestral configuration. given that both tetraodon and xenopus have an identical gene order, it is more parsimonious to conclude that the h. sapiens configuration is derived . the data indicates that prior to the divergence of these three lineages the aromatase gene was already at this precise location . in the case of tetraodon, this region has duplicated further onto chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  originating cyp19a and b, most likely as the result of a further genome duplication on the teleost lineage . later in evolution, a genomic inversion has taken place in the human lineage  .

cyp <dig> in amphioxus
the phylogenetic analysis, paralogy study and the conservation of gene organisation around aromatase in three vertebrate species suggest that cyp <dig>  was present in the invertebrate unduplicated mhc-paralogon prior to vertebrate radiation. however, they do not rule out the possibility that cyp <dig> emerged either just before or after the divergence of lamprey/hagfish and gnathostomes  . the exact timing of the proposed two rounds of genome duplications which structure the vertebrate genome is still contentious. however, the consensus points to one duplication prior to the divergence of lamprey/hagfish and gnathostomes, and the second after the divergence of these lineages  <cit>  . furthermore, in the genome sequence of the sea squirt despite the evidence of an mhc unduplicated paralogon  <cit> , no orthologue of aromatase has been found  <cit> . on the contrary, amphioxus has proved a more favourable model to address these issues  <cit> . in order to investigate the presence of cyp <dig> in b. floridae, a blast search to the trace archives of the whole genome sequence using the cyp <dig> sequence from the stingray  was performed. a single hit with a significant e-value was retrieved. this information was subsequently used to isolate a partial sequence  from dna extracted from a cdna 5– <dig> h embryo library. in figure 5a, we show the dna sequence and the predicted amino acid translation. when run on blast, it clearly emerges that it belongs to the cyp <dig> gene family. we designate this amphicyp <dig>  vertebrate aromatase genes display typical putative structural domains. these include the i-helix region, ozol's peptide region, aromatic region and heme-binding region  <cit>  . the alignment provided in figure 5b indicates the presence of similar motifs in the amphicyp <dig> sequence we now describe. the orthology of the retrieved sequence was determined through phylogeny. overall, this analysis strongly indicates that amphcyp <dig> is part of the aromatase evolutionary clade  . our result suggests that that a single cyp <dig> gene was present at the base of the chordate lineage. we propose that it has been independently lost in the urochordate c. intestinalis. we argue that the ancestral invertebrate chordate cyp <dig> gene underwent two rounds of "en bloc" duplication like many other gene families in the mhc-paralogon to yield four paralogues. three of these have been lost. however, we cannot rule out that no cyp <dig> duplications occurred in the vertebrate lineage, regardless of whether "en bloc" duplications occurred in other gene families. we favour the first scenario.

the present results imply a significant theoretical change regarding the ancestry of the cyp <dig> gene family. this investigation started with the observation that the human aromatase gene maps to the mhc-paralogon. nevertheless, two opposite scenarios could be draw from the phylogenetic analysis, paralogy and comparative genomics. either the cyp <dig> locus was present in the invertebrate chordate unduplicated mhc-paralogon, and the presence of a single paralogue resulted from gene loss; or cyp <dig> originated early on in vertebrate evolution in its present position in the mhc-paralogon . we went on to test these hypotheses. our results can be summarised as follows:  vertebrate cyp <dig> containing regions are indeed part of the mhc-paralogon as demonstrated by the phylogenetic analysis of the gene families in close proximity;  comparative genomics of the aromatase region between fish, amphibians and humans shows a striking pattern of conservation without any gene insertion;  following the previous analysis, we found that cyp <dig> is not restricted to the vertebrate clade, given the description of amphicyp <dig> 

our model determine the loss of three aromatase paralogues upon duplication of the ancestral mhc-paralogon. for the vast majority of paralogy regions it is difficult to precisely determine the amount of gene loss . in the case of the mhc-paralogon an estimate can be calculated, given the previous work of several authors  <cit> . the sequencing and mapping data of the mhc anchor genes in amphioxus, shows a significant proportion of gene families which are single-copy in both lineages   <cit> . thus, the return to a single copy status following the "en bloc" duplication was not a rare event upon the duplication of the mhc-paralogon. at the moment we do not known whether amphicyp <dig> maps along with the mhc anchor genes in a single chromosome, but this hypothesis can be tested in the future  <cit> .

finally, we speculate that the ancestry of cyp <dig> genes could be more ancient than invertebrate chordate origin. two reasons support this scenario. first, the sex steroid receptors  are older than previously proposed  <cit> . the estrogen receptor found in aplysia indicates that the duplication event from a sex steroid precursor receptor pre-dates the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes  <cit> . also, the phylogenetic analysis and paralogy studies of androgen, progesterone and corticoid receptors suggests that a single receptor was present in the ancestral urbilateria  <cit> . thus, the receptor gene kit for sex steroid hormones was already present in the primitive bilateria . the second reason comes from lophotrocozoan molluscs. these organisms respond to steroid hormones  during their reproductive cycle  <cit> . furthermore, biochemical analysis in mollusc tissue extracts reveals the presence of an aromatase-like activity  <cit> . in light of these findings and observations, we argue that the presence of cyp <dig> should be investigated in lophotrocozoan protostomes .

CONCLUSIONS
we present here a detailed study of the genomic region containing the aromatase gene in three vertebrate lineages. the gene families found in close proximity to cyp <dig> show a clear pattern of vertebrate specific duplication, as expected from a paralogon. a key prediction from paralogy regions is their unduplicated presence in pre-vertebrate genomes. significantly, we have also found that the genomic organisation of the human cyp <dig> genomic region mimics that of tetraodon and xenopus. overall our analysis suggested the existence of aromatase in invertebrates. in agreement with this hypothesis we have found a cyp <dig> orthologue in the invertebrate chordate amphioxus. contrary to previous suggestions, our data implies that cyp <dig> was present in the primitive chordate .
