BACKGROUND
alzheimer is a common disease that threatens the health of the elderly
. uncaria a member of the rubiaceae family, has long been used in traditional chinese medicine to treat hypertension, convulsions, tremor, and stroke
 <cit> . indole alkaloids present in aqueous solution have been shown to interfere with fiber formation of β-amyloid protein  and destabilize preformed aβ fibrils, a pathological marker of alzheimer’s disease
 <cit> . an ethanol extract of uncaria was found to improve the cognitive impairment of alzheimer’s disease caused by d-galactose in mice
 <cit> . rin and irn two major alkaloid chemicals that are synthesized in uncaria capsules, can inhibit the activation of microglia and reduce aβ-induced death in cell lines used to study neuronal differentiation 
 <cit> . also rin reduces aβ cytotoxicity by inhibiting intracellular calcium overloading and tau protein hyperphosphorylation
 <cit> . extracts from uncaria have the potential for delaying or alleviating the symptoms of alzheimer’s diseases that could significantly improve the quality of life of patients.

rin and irn belong to tias. tias are a diverse class of natural products that comprise over  <dig> members, many of which possess significant physiological activity. most tias are found in three dicotyledon plant families: apocynaceae, rubiaceae and loganiaceae, and are thought to be part of a plants chemical defense against pests
 <cit> . tias have a wide variety of different molecular structures and biological activities
 <cit> . notable tias include vincristine and vinblastine of catharanthus roseus that have anti-tumor activity. vinblastine is clinically used for the treatment of leukemia, hodgkin’s lymphoma and other cancers
. ajmaline of rauwolfia serpentina can block the sodium channel and resist arrhythmia
. whereas, yohimbine is antagonist of α-2-adrenoceptor and a potential drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction
 <cit> . camptothecin of ophiorrhiza pumila and camptotheca acuminata is a topoisomerase enzyme inhibitor, and has anti-cancer effect
 <cit> . quinine of cinchona species is a known anti-malarial drug
 <cit> . tias production in plants is generally low and difficult to synthesize chemically, limiting the utility of these therapeutic chemicals unless production is increased by metabolic engineering
 <cit> . however, metabolic engineering requires knowledge of the tias biosynthesis pathway which is only well understood for a few, such as vindoline and ajmaline.

tias biosynthesis involve multiple and complex metabolic pathways. all tias are derived from tryptophan and secologanin. tryptophan decarboxylase , a pyridoxal dependent enzyme converts tryptophan to tryptamine. isopentenyl diphosphate  the precursor for all terpenoids is produced by the triose phosphate/pyruvate or “non-mevalonate” pathway 
 <cit> . in the first committed step of iridoid terpene biosynthesis, geraniol, derived from ipp, is hydroxylated by geraniol-10-hydroxylase 
 <cit> . oxidation of the iridotrial aldehyde to the carboxylic acid is followed by esterification and glucosylationto, yield deoxyloganin; subsequent hydroxylation of deoxyloganin yields loganin. secologanin is then generated by oxidative cleavage of loganin by the enzyme secologanin synthase 
. biosynthesis of secologanin is thought to be potential rate-limiting step in tias biosynthesis. tryptamine of tryptophan metabolic pathway via strictosidine synthase  catalysis forms strictosidine
 <cit> , and then enters tias biosynthetic pathway
 <cit> . this part of the synthesis processes is the best characterized, and the genes encoding the enzymes are known. however each individual tias has a synthetic branch, which is started at strictosidine. through four variable precursors, , each active substance enters the branch path. from structural analysis of rin and irn, they may be transformed from stemmadenine . this speculation is according to the up-stream pathway of tias synthesis, which is the biosynthetic process of secologanin
 <cit> . stemmadenine synthesized rin and irn through the chemical reactions of oxidation and methyl transfer. this process requires three kinds of enzymes; oxidoreductases, methyltransferases and isomerases. the genes coding for oxidoreductases, methyltransferases and isomerases are defined as “late step genes” of rin and irn biosynthesis.figure  <dig>

next generation sequencing technologies have proved to be rapid and cost-effective means to analyze the genome and transcriptome in non-model species. in this study, knowledge of the rapid accumulation periods of rin and irn in uncaria was used to find potential candidates in the synthesis of these tias. using transcriptome sequencing, de novo assembly and dge analysis, candidate genes encoding putative enzymes responsible for late steps in rin and irn synthesis were identified. our results lay a foundation for construction of the rin and irn biosynthetic pathways that will in turn aid the study of the regulation and metabolic engineering of rin and irn biosynthesis.

RESULTS
de novotranscriptome sequencing of capsule
we compared rin and irn content throughout the development of uncaria’s capsule, from fallen petal  to maturity  . rin and irn content changed dramatically during the development of the uncaria capsule. the two tias accumulate in the capsules were detected in capsule  <dig> , until a maximum is reached at sample point  <dig>  20 days later, and then drops to its lowest levels at capsule maturity  after another 20 days . to obtain an overview of the uncaria capsule transcriptome in the process of rin and irn accumulation, a cdna library was generated from an equal mixture of rna isolated from capsule  <dig> , capsule  <dig> , and capsule  <dig> . the library was sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform.  <dig> million raw reads were obtained which had  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  , which were used for all subsequent analysis.figure  <dig>

with the increase of the sequencing length, sequencing error rates will rise
 <cit> , but the error rate does not exceed 1% . 6 bp random primers were used in reverse transcription. the incomplete binding of random primers and template could cause sequencing errors of the first six nucleotides position
 <cit>  . clean reads were spliced into transcripts by trinity software 
 <cit> , and  <dig>  transcripts were obtained. transcript length was an index which measured with splicing effect. to a certain extent, n <dig> can evaluate splicing integrity
 <cit> . the average length of transcript was  <dig>  bp, the longest transcript was  <dig>  bp, the shortest transcript was 201 bp . from these transcripts,  <dig>  unigenes were identified, with an average length of 717 bp, the longest unigene was  <dig>  bp, the shortest unigene 201 bp . the length statistics of spliced transcripts and unigenes were shown in additional file

open reading frame  was obtained by comparing annotation results of unigenes with the different databases, the unigenes were then determined using coding sequence  according to the standard codon table
 <cit> . if the results from different databases were contradictory, priority was given to nr, swiss-prot and kegg genes respectively. the unigenes that failed to match the database information the predicted protein cds was determined using estscan software
 <cit> . the cds of  <dig>  unigenes  could be predicted using the annotation databases whereas  <dig>  unigenes  cds predictions were made using estscan software.

genes involved in the biosynthesis of tias
tias biosynthesis involves three upstream metabolic pathways, including mep pathway, iridoid glycosides pathway and shikimate pathway
 <cit> . secologanin is a natural active substance and iridoid glycoside product of tias biosynthetic precursor, but its synthesis process is not yet understood. another precursor tryptamine; is generated by tryptophan using the shikimate pathway by catalysis with tdc. tdc is communication node between primary metabolism and secondary metabolism. unigenes annotated by comparison with the nr database comparison that could encode enzymes related the above pathways are listed in additional file
1: table s <dig>  all putative oxidoreductases that could represent genes involved in the late steps in rin and irn synthesis are listed in additional file
1: table s <dig> .

the mep pathway is branch of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis  and the iridoid glycosides pathway is branch of monoterpenoid biosynthesis , the product of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis  enters indole alkaloid biosynthesis  via tdc and str. putative unigenes associated with tias synthesis were annotated by ko database . the uncaria capsule transcriptome data contained all genes encoding every enzyme of the mep pathway and shikimate pathway. however, there are deficiencies associated with the databases as the monoterpenoid biosynthesis  in ko is only aligned to myrcene/ocimene synthase . in the kegg pathway, tdc belongs to indole alkaloid biosynthesis , which is only aligned to str, not aligned to the tdc. the reason may be few studies were conducted with tias biosynthesis, and reference data was insufficient.

capsule dge analysis at different periods
dge sequencing analysis of capsule  <dig>  capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig> was performed by illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing platforms, respectively. capsule  <dig> produced  <dig> , <dig> clean reads, capsule  <dig> produced  <dig> , <dig> clean reads, and capsule  <dig> produced  <dig> , <dig> clean reads. the clean reads of the samples were mapped to the reference sequence derived from our uncaria transcriptome data, and obtained from the annotation information of each sample using rsem software
 <cit> . total mapped reads were capsule  <dig>  <dig> , <dig> , capsule  <dig>  <dig> , <dig> , and capsule  <dig>  <dig> , <dig>  with approximately  <dig>  unigenes annotated in each sample. to estimate the level of gene expression the reads count were transformed into reads per kilo bases per million mapped reads 
 <cit> . rpkm is the number of reads per million reads from one gene per thousand bases, considering the effect of sequence length and depth of rna-seq process on the reads count. the size of rpkm value therefore reflects the abundance of the gene expression and we defined rpkm >  <dig>  as the threshold of significant gene expression. the density distribution of rpkm can test gene expression profiles of samples; comparison chart of gene expression profiles among three samples was showed in figure 
 <dig>  among them, the common genes of three samples reached  <dig> , characteristic genes of capsule  <dig> were  <dig> , characteristic genes of capsule  <dig> were  <dig>  and characteristic genes of capsule  <dig> were  <dig> .figure  <dig>

analysis of differentially expressed genes
read count data was used to analyze the difference of gene expression. since only one biological samples was sequenced, in order to avoid possible high false positive rates we first used trimmed mean of m values  to standardize data processing
 <cit> , then took advantage of degseq to analyze differentially expressed genes; the analysis conditions were qvalue < <dig>  & log <dig>  >1
. there were  <dig>  differentially expressed genes identified between capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig>  with  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated;  <dig>  differentially expressed genes between capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated;  <dig>  differentially expressed genes in capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig>  with  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. comparison between differentially expressed genes between the three samples is shown in figure 
 <dig>  capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> comparisons had the most specific differentially expressed genes. interestingly, capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> had  <dig> common differentially expressed genes, capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> had  <dig> common differentially expressed genes, the two were very close.figure  <dig>

differentially expressed genes of from the dge analysis were further analyzed using go and kegg enrichment in order to determine their potential function and within a metabolic pathway. go enrichment classification using goseq
 <cit> . go classification of differentially expressed genes between the different capsule stages is showed in additional file
2: figure s <dig> .  <dig> differentially expressed genes of capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> were classified into the biological process, and  <dig> genes were identified as involved in oxidation-reduction process .  <dig> genes were classified into cellular component.  <dig> genes were classified into molecular function,  <dig> genes involved in catalytic activity ,  <dig> genes involved in oxidoreductase activity .  <dig> genes among differentially expressed genes of capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> were classified into the biological process,  <dig> genes involved in oxidation-reduction process .  <dig> genes were classified into cellular component,  <dig> genes were classified into molecular function,  <dig> genes participated in oxidoreductase activity .  <dig> genes among differentially expressed genes of capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig> were classified into the biological process,  <dig> genes involved in oxidation-reduction process .  <dig> genes were classified into cellular component,  <dig> genes were classified into molecular function,  <dig> genes participated in oxidoreductase activity .

kegg enrichment classification  was used to identify significant enrichment pathways of differentially expressed genes between the different stages of uncaria capsule development using a false discovery rate  ≤ <dig> . flavonoid biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , phenylalanine metabolism  and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  were significantly enriched pathways among the differentially expressed genes between the capsule stages. indole alkaloid biosynthesis  was enriched in capsule  <dig> vs capsule  <dig>  but did not reach significant level  [in additional file
2: figure s <dig> ].

analysis of genes with homology to known genes involved in tia biosynthesis
there were  <dig> unigenes that may be involved in the tia biosynthesis due to their homology to genes known to be involved in tia from other species by ncbi nr comparisons
 <cit> . to narrow down this list we looked for genes that showed expression profiles consistent with changes in rin and irn content during capsule development. as previously mentioned rin and irn content is strongly elevated between capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig>  then decreased significantly between capsule  <dig> and capsule  <dig>  rin and irn content is also lower in capsule  <dig> than that present in capsule  <dig>   <dig> of the putative tias biosynthesis genes showed significantly up or down-regulated expression . however, only ten genes had expression profiles either similar or inverse to rin and irn accumulation in at least  <dig> stages. anthranilate synthase   and loganin acid methyltransferase   expression profiles matched of the direction of rin and irn content change, whereas sls  had the inverse expression profiles. the expression profiles of tdc , g10h  and str  had two phases consistent with rin and irn changes. a total of  <dig> unigenes of ko annotation involved in the synthesis of tias were based on enzymes of kegg pathway. dge analysis found that  <dig> unigenes showed significantly up/down-regulated expression changes . as  expression changes with direction of rin and irn content change was consistent. the up/down regulated expression changes of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase   and str  with direction of rin and irn content change, two phases were consistent.

analysis of putative genes involved in the late steps of rin and irn biosynthesis
enzymes classes putatively involved of biosynthesis of rin and irn include oxidoreductase, transferase, and isomerase. cyp <dig> is one of the oldest protein families, has catalytic oxidation function of carbon-carbon bond, alkyl hydroxylation and hydroxyl oxidation, and plays an important role in plant secondary metabolites synthesis process
. oxidoreductases involved in rin and irn synthesis are therefore likely to come from the cyp <dig> family. there are  <dig> varieties of methyltransferase but only o-methyl transferase is likely to be involved in rin and irn
 <cit> . isomerase are relatively unknown, however isomers conversion between rin and irn could be realized through enzyme catalysis, as natural transformation of the chemical equilibrium is likely to be small.

from the uncaria transcriptome data, a total of  <dig> cyp <dig>   <dig> methyltransferase and  <dig> isomerase unigenes were identified. dge analysis showed  <dig> cyp450s were significantly up/down-regulated during capsule development . only the expression of  <dig> unigene  matched changes in rin and irn content. the expression profiles of  <dig> unigenes  had similar to rin and irn content in two stages.  <dig> methyltransferase unigenes possessed significantly differential expression in the process of capsule development .  <dig> unigene  expression profile was consistent to rin and irn content. whereas, the expression profile of  <dig> unigenes  where similar to rin and irn content in two stages.  <dig> unigenes putatively encoding isomerases had significantly altered expression in the process of capsule rin and irn content change , with  <dig> unigenes  showing changes consistent with the tias rin and irn content in two stages.

str is a starting point and key enzyme of tias synthesis involved in the early part of tias synthesis. str expression will affect the metabolic activities of the downstream branch. the gene expression profiles of tias downstream branch are expected to be similar to the expression profiles of str. the gene expression profiles not only include up/down-regulated expression, but also include gene expression variation and amplitude from each stage of capsule 1 → capsule 2 → capsule  <dig>  expression profiles of cyp <dig>  methyltransferase and isomerase hierarchically clustered with that of str  . ten candidate genes were found to cluster closely with str . the candidate genes of cyp <dig> had  <dig> unigenes ; candidate genes of methyltransferase had  <dig> unigenes  and candidate genes of isomerase had  <dig> unigenes . through the alignment of transcriptome database, the candidate unigene sequences and amino acid sequences of “late step genes” of rin and irn biosynthesis were obtained and showed in additional file

quantitative pcr analysis of candidate tia biosynthesis genes
quantitative pcr analysis was performed on  <dig> selected genes from cyp <dig>  methyltransferase, isomerases and str functional categories putatively involved in tia biosynthesis of uncaria. the relative expression changes of the candidate genes are shown in figure 
 <dig>  generally during the developmental process of capsule  <dig> to capsule  <dig>  and capsule  <dig> to capsule  <dig> growth, the expression profiles of the genes assayed show highest gene expression at the capsule  <dig> stage, and lowest gene expression at capsule  <dig>  mirroring the measured rin and irn content profiles, and confirming the dge expression data. the str genes  however showed only marginal increases at capsule  <dig> stage. the relative expression of one of the cyp <dig> genes  was inverse to the expected expression, with lowest expression at capsule  <dig> and then increasing at capsule  <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
the medicinal parts of uncaria are its “stem and stem hook” and the effective pharmacological constituents are rin and irn. in uncaria plants, if a branch has a capsule, then there will be no stem hook. a branch with a stem hook growing on it, will not have flowers nor capsules next to it. in such case, there are two kinds of leaves and stems, one is the twig containing the capsule and the other is the twig containing a stem hook. “stem and stem hook”, leaf, stem and capsule of uncaria contain rin and irn, and different parts contain different content . however, the difference between the rin and irn content of the “stem and stem hook” and that of stem on the branch with capsule is not significant. in addition, the serious lignification of the stem influences the integrity of rna. by contrast, the difference between the rin and irn content of leaf on the branch with capsule and that of the leaf on the branch with stem hook is significant. no proteins related to the biosynthesis of the two tias have been found through dimensional electrophoresis analysis . among all the tissues and organs, the capsule has the highest rin and irn content and during the developmental process there is an increase and then decrease in the accumulation of the rin and irn. these changes in rin and irn content in the capsule reflect different rates of synthesis and provides a means for identifying candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of rin and irn through analyzing the gene expression profiles
 <cit> .

next generation sequencing technology  offers a shortcut for research on functional genomics, comparative genomics
 and genetic analysis
 <cit>  of non-model plants. with the progress of ngs, and the increase of sequencing throughput, improvements in accuracy, and decreased costs, enable this technology to be broadly applied to various research areas
 <cit> . there is little to no genome information of uncaria or the related species. therefore sequencing rna using ngs from a specific period of plant development or treatment provides the information necessary for de novo assembly of the transcriptome; generating a reference transcriptome sequence for non model plants that can provide the basis for finding genes associated with particular important functions
. dge can quickly and thoroughly analyze the gene expression under a variety of tissues and conditions
 <cit> . dge however requires a reference sequence to align the relative small read lengths. combining dge with an rna-sequencing generated reference transcriptome provides an excellent combination for analysis of non model plant species. confirmation of the expression profiles of a subset of genes identified dge using qpcr indicates the accuracy of this method for quickly identifying candidates based on expression profiles.

predicting the biosynthesis pathway of rin and irn lays the theoretical foundation for the regulation of the rin and irn accumulation as well as their metabolic engineering research
 <cit> . the formation of tias precursor involves the shikimate pathway of tryptophan metabolism and mep pathway which are the common pathways of terpene biosynthesis. during the comparison and annotation of tia like genes, we found all the encoding genes of the related enzymes in the two pathways in our cdna library. moreover, the encoding genes of str which include the cyp <dig>  methyltransferase and isomerase of later biosynthetic step in rin and irn biosynthesis were also found. by regulating the metabolic pathway, the accumulation of the rin and irn in the plant can be improved
 <cit> . this can be started from many aspects such as improving the tias biosynthesis pathway activity and upstream shunt volume of carbon skeleton. improvement of biosynthesis pathway activity can be fulfilled through improving the activity of the key enzyme in the pathway
 <cit> . the increase of carbon shunt volume needs to shunt more carbon from the glycometabolism to enter the target pathway. additionally, weaken or cutting off the carbon channel of non target pathways etc. the mep pathway exists in the plastid, the amount of which can be increased by employing the matrilineal inheritance feature of plastid. in this way, more carbon in the glycometabolism will enter the rin and irn biosynthesis pathway. alternatively, increase/enhance the transporter quantity/transport ability on the plastid membrane involved in the intermediate products of the mep pathway of rin and irn biosynthesis through transformation of the organelle. ultimately the substrate amount of iridoid pathway is increased. the auto-regulation mechanism of plant biosynthetic pathways is complex and strict. construction of the vitro rin and irn biosynthesis pathway using information from the related research on vinblastine and vincristine
 may provide a means of accelerating our knowledge of the pathways. the low yield of natural active substances is one of the factors limiting the development and utilization of chinese medicine resources. the use of engineering techniques to improve production of natural active substance is an effective way to solve the contradiction between supply and demand. this study presented the pathway of rin and irn biosynthesis, and laid the theoretical foundation for the medicinal potential development of rin and irn. if the yield issues of rin and irn are effectively solved then they will have a wider range of applications in the treatment of alzheimer’s disease.

CONCLUSIONS
a combination of de novo transcriptome sequencing and dge analysis based on the next generation sequencing technology was shown to be a powerful method for identifying candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of novel secondary metabolites in a non-model plant. through this method, biosynthetic encoding genes of uncaria tias biological precursor were found. cyp <dig>  methyltransferase and isomerase were selected as potential candidates involved in late biosynthesis of rin and irn. the transcriptome data from this study provides an important resource for understanding the formation of major bioactive constituents in the capsule extract from uncaria.
