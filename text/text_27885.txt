BACKGROUND
during the last years an increasing number of bacterial transcriptomes have been examined with tiling arrays and rna sequencing  technologies, revealing that a significant number of protein-coding genes are also transcribed from the reverse complementary strand in a wide range of bacterial species . overlapping transcription results in the generation of antisense rnas  with sizes ranging from tens to thousands of nucleotides . regulatory roles of asrnas were first reported more than 30 years ago in escherichia coli, where plasmid-encoded asrnas were found to negatively regulate plasmid copy number . since then bacterial asrnas were only occasionally detected and therefore considered to be rare, and as late as in  <dig> only about thirty bacterial asrnas had been identified . however, due to the use of tiling array and especially rna-seq the number of reported asrnas in bacterial transcriptomes is now rapidly growing. the characterization of the physiological function of individual asrnas is however lagging behind. asrnas are known to affect the expression of the target gene by different mechanisms . these include:  interference by convergent transcription, in which transcription from one promoter is suppressed by a second promoter located in the opposite strand,  transcription attenuation, in which base pairing of the asrna to the target mrna causes premature transcription termination,  changes in the target rna stability, where the asrna either promotes or blocks degradation or cleavage of the mrna by ribonucleases,  asrnas can directly block ribosome binding, and  might indirectly impact ribosome binding  by affecting the target rna structure. in addition, regulating the expression of the opposite gene is not the only function of certain asrnas. some asrnas encode small proteins  <cit> , and some have the potential to act on multiple targets in trans
.

in this work, we used rna-seq to identify asrnas in the human pathogen p. aeruginosa, which can cause severe infections, particularly in immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis  patients. the cf lung is an osmotically stressful environment, due to the viscous, dehydrated mucus, cellular debris and electrolytes competing for a limited supply of water  <cit> . a variety of studies have shown that p. aeruginosa encounters reactive oxygen species  in the lungs of cf patients due to the exaggerated, sustained and extended inflammatory response, characterized by influx of neutrophils and high concentrations of interleukin- <dig> . in addition, p. aeruginosa-infected cf patients are routinely treated with several types of antibiotics, because early and aggressive antipseudomonal treatment regimens are correlated with improved lung function and survival of cf patients  <cit> . recently, two independent studies identified antisense transcription in p. aeruginosa. one of the studies investigated strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> at early stationary growth phase and found  <dig> asrnas, of which  <dig> were expressed in strain pao <dig>  <cit> . the other study identified  <dig> antisense transcriptional start sites, but not full length asrnas, in p. aeruginosa pa <dig> grown at 28°c and at 37°c  <cit> . the expression of asrnas most likely occurs in a transient manner and is dependent on specific environmental cues. therefore, we chose to monitor the expression of asrnas in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> grown in several different conditions to ensure a comprehensive characterization of the p. aeruginosa asrna-ome. accordingly, exponentially growing populations of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> were exposed to osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress. the antibiotics used in this study were ß-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, colistin and tetracycline. all the antibiotics used, with the exception of tetracyclin, are routinely used against p. aeruginosa infections . finally, the expression of asrnas was also investigated during exponential and stationary growth.

recently, we showed that library preparation for rna-seq plays a fundamental role when aiming at identifying novel transcripts  <cit> . using three different rna-seq library protocols with different srna abundance, we identified over  <dig> novel intergenic srnas in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> . although the use of three different libraries increased the number of novel transcripts identified, there were significant differences in the subset of transcripts detected in each library. libraries that were prepared with a size-selected fraction of rna were more sensitive in the detection of intergenic srnas  <cit> . in the present study we report  <dig> novel asrnas that were identified using strand-specific rna-seq libraries that contain cdna originating from transcripts shorter than 500 nt  <cit> .

RESULTS

in total, we identified  <dig> novel asrnas longer than 50 nt, of which  <dig> are novel transcripts. the  <dig> asrnas already identified by other studies are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  additional file  <dig> lists the coordinates of the  <dig> asrnas, as well as the annotation of genes transcribed from the opposite strand. only asrnas longer than 50 nt were taken into consideration. the longest detected asrna is 581-nt long. the asrnas were categorized depending on their position with respect to the antisense gene as “start-span” , “internal” , or “end-span” . thirteen asrnas overlapped with two contiguous genes transcribed from the opposite strand. some genes have untranslated regions  either in the 5’ or the 3’ end which can contain regulatory elements for controlling gene expression. utrs sometimes extend into the neighboring genes, so we cannot rule out that some of the detected asrnas might actually be utrs from neighboring genes. to prevent mis-annotation of utrs as asrnas, we have not included asrnas that terminated less than 100 bp to the start of a flanking gene with the same direction as the asrna. however we cannot rule out that some of the novel asrnas identified in this study might be long utrs belonging to flanking genes, or even novel coding genes. it is also possible that some of the asrnas identified are the result of non-specific transcription and thus have no physiological functions.table  <dig>

next, we examined the distribution of antisense srnas in the genome and found the asrnas to be homogenously distributed throughout the genome of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> . a recent study by wurtzel et al. found that antisense srnas are more often found in some parts of the accessory genome of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit> . specifically, the authors identified  <dig> sites with overlapping transcription on the reverse strand, and found that the pathogenicity island papi- <dig> harbors 5-fold more asrna loci compared to the core genome. in this study we do not observe a similar enrichment of antisense transcripts in certain parts of the genome. there are two reasons that might explain the difference between this study and the one from wurtzel et al. . i) the strain used in the study is p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  while wurtzel et al.  used strain pa <dig>  the papi- <dig> island is found in strain pa <dig> but not in pao <dig>  though it can be transferred by a type iv pilus  <cit> . ii) wurtzel et al.  studied two conditions . in this study we sequenced samples from p. aeruginosa growing in  <dig> different conditions. studying more conditions might lead to finding antisense transcription sites in more genomic locations, and therefore avoiding enrichment of expression of asrnas associated to a specific condition.figure  <dig>

functional classification and differential expression of asrnas
figure 1b shows the classification of genes with asrnas transcribed from the reverse strand in our experiments according to their function. we found a significant overrepresentation of the classes ‘cell division’  and ‘cell wall / lps / capsule’ . this overrepresentation of genes involved in cell division and cell wall, lipopolysaccharide , and capsule biosynthesis most likely reflects the conditions used in this study. the conditions studied  greatly affect both the bacterial replication and cell wall synthesis, and therefore fast regulation of the genes involved in these processes is essential. indeed we observe significant changes in expression of cell division and lps genes after the antibiotic treatments , which is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . interestingly we have detected  <dig> asrnas  that are transcribed opposite to  <dig> genes of the wbp cluster  . the wbp cluster contains genes encoding proteins involved the b-band lps o-antigen biosynthesis in p. aeruginosa, including genes for enzymes involved in synthesis and transfer of sugar nucleotides and o-antigen processing  <cit> . wbpb, wbpe, and wbpd are the three central enzymes in this pathway  <cit> . cirz et al.  reported that the transcription of wbp genes were decreased by 2- to 6-fold after exposure to ciprofloxacin  <cit> . our sequencing results originating from libraries containing the full transcriptome show the same trend after ciprofloxacin and tobramycin exposure, with down-regulation of the wbp genes of 2- to 15-fold, and down-regulation of the asrnas as138-as <dig> of 2- to 10-fold. however further investigations are required to assess whether these asrnas affect the levels of the wbp genes encoded on the opposite strand.

figure 2a represents the number of asrnas whose expression is significantly changed during the conditions tested . a substantial number of asrnas significantly change their expression, indicating that their putative regulatory effects may be important during the conditions tested. a hierarchical cluster analysis of expression of the most differentially expressed asrnas illustrates how related conditions show similar patterns of asrna expression . the treatments with three of the β-lactams , whose modes of action are alike, are clustered together. the β-lactam not clustered in this group is meropenem, a carbapenem which displays a much faster time-kill curve than the other three β-lactams tested . additional file  <dig> lists the asrnas differentially transcribed in our conditions, as well as their fold-change in expression. we anticipate that these data will be important to understand the regulation of genes that show antisense transcription on the reverse strand. in most cases we do not observe a clear and significant correlation between the transcriptional levels of asrnas and their target genes. this makes it difficult to infer the mode of action of asrnas, and it might indicate that the role of most asrnas is to fine-tune the regulation of gene expression. this is known to be the case for some srnas in pseudomonas species  <cit> . in addition asrnas can regulate the translation of their target genes either positively or negatively, without affecting their transcriptional levels. thus the level of expression alone cannot explain the mechanism of action of asrnas, and more experiments will be needed in order to determine how asrnas regulate their target genes.figure  <dig>

comparison between asrnas detected in different studies
recently two independent studies used rna-seq to investigate transcription in p. aeruginosa and revealed novel asrnas. one of the studies investigated strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> grown aerobically in brain heart infusion  rich medium at 37°c and harvested at early stationary phase  <cit> . the authors found  <dig> asrnas. interestingly, a number of these asrnas were strain-specific or showed strain-specific expression:  <dig> asrnas were only expressed in strain pao <dig>   <dig> were only expressed in strain pa <dig>  and  <dig> were expressed in both strains. the other study investigated p. aeruginosa pa <dig> grown aerobically at 28°c and at 37°c in lb medium and harvested at early stationary phase  <cit> . the authors identified  <dig> transcription start sites with overlapping transcription on the reverse strand. however, due to their library preparation protocol, wurtzel et al.  could not determine the length of the asrnas, but only the antisense transcription start sites  <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> asrnas with lengths ranging from  <dig> to 581 nt. we did not take into consideration neither asrnas shorter than 50 nt, nor asrnas that might be suspected to be utrs of flanking genes. this might explain why we identify considerably fewer asrnas than wurtzel et al. . figure  <dig> represents the overlap between the asrnas detected in this study and the two previous ones. only a small partial overlap between studies is observed. the overlap between pairs of studies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> asrnas, and only four asrnas were detected in all three studies . these asrnas are transcribed antisense to the glutathione synthetase gene gshb, the nadh dehydrogenase i chain a gene nuoa, the ribosome biogenesis gtp-binding protein ysxc gene ysxc, and the penicillin-binding protein 1a gene pona. we have validated the expression of the latter asrna, from now on called aspona, using 5’- and 3’-race. the coordinates of aspona were very similar between the rna-seq data and the race experiments, with differences of up to 19 nt between the two techniques. aspona is upregulated upon aztreonam , piperacillin , and ciprofloxacin  exposure, and downregulated during meropenem , colistin , tobramycin , and tetracycline  exposure. aspona overlaps with the predicted - <dig> and - <dig> σ <dig> promoter elements of the pona gene . due to the location of aspona, we hypothesized that it probably belongs to the class of asrnas that prevent the transcription or translation of the opposite gene, either by transcription interference or by directly blocking ribosome binding. wurtzel et al.  and ferrara et al.  detected the expression of aspona in p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and pao <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the  <dig> asrnas detected in all  <dig> studies are shown in bold.

the lack of overlap between the reported asrnas may be caused by the different characteristics of each work, as  different growth conditions,  different p. aeruginosa strains, and  different methods to perform rna-seq were used in each of them.  the three studies investigated different p. aeruginosa strains  grown under different conditions, which may account for part of the differences in the asrnas detected. as previously mentioned, the level of expression of asrnas varies greatly that in the different conditions used in our experiments , and in consequence the asrnas that are detected by rna-seq in each condition.  the evolution of bacterial srnas appears to be rapid and, as a result, sequence similarities between srnas are limited, even between relatively closely related species  <cit> . in a previous study we showed that, out of  <dig> novel intergenic srnas detected in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the sequences of 88% of the srnas are not conserved outside p. aeruginosa, indicating that the extent of conservation in other pseudomonas species is limited  <cit> . ferrara et al.  have reported that even under the same growth conditions, different strains of p. aeruginosa  express different sets of both intergenic and antisense srnas  <cit> . however when comparing studies that investigated the same strain, the extent of the overlap is still small . we considered whether the expression of strain-specific asrnas was due to the existence of antisense promoters that were present in only one of the two strains. however, upon examination of strain-specific asrnas, we observed that the predicted antisense promoters were present in both strains even if antisense transcription was only detected in one of them.  we hypothesize that the main cause for the limited overlap between the studies may be the biases arising from the technical variation between the studies. these three studies used considerably different rna extraction methods, rna-seq library preparation protocols, sequencing platforms and bioinformatic analysis pipelines.

library preparation for rna-seq experiments requires multiple enzyme-catalyzed steps such as sequential oligonucleotide adapter ligations to the 5’and  <dig> ends of rnas, reverse transcription , and pcr. rna ligase preferences may contribute to the observed bias in srna detection , as well as the rt reaction and pcr . the biases in srna detection could even be caused by the use of different buffer compositions and additives that modify enzymatic activity. hafner et al.  investigated the biases associated to the adapter ligation steps involved rna-seq library preparation  <cit> . the biases found were mainly due to the sequences of rnas, and that secondary and tertiary structures of rnas affected the efficiency of 5’- and 3’-adapter ligation during library preparation. the sequences of 5’ and 3’ adapters were also found to affect the ligation yields  <cit> . in line with these results, another study also demonstrated that rna and rna-adapter secondary structures drastically influences rna ligation efficiencies  <cit> . another investigation reported that increased variability of adapter sequences helps to increase the diversity of rnas ligated  <cit> . recent systematic investigations have revealed method-dependent biases in mirna quantification  <cit> . based on identical starting material, these studies demonstrated that alternative library preparation methods resulted in entirely different mirna expression levels. it was observed that the detection of mirnas by rna-seq was strongly biased towards certain mirnas, preventing the accurate determination of absolute numbers of transcripts  <cit> . however the biases were found to be systematic and highly reproducible and differential expression results between samples obtained by qpcr and rna-seq were strongly correlated, showing that rna-seq is suited for determining relative expression differences between samples  <cit> . unexpectedly, the observed bias was mostly independent of the sequencing platform but strongly determined by the method used for library preparation. library replicates gave similar results, which indicates that the data bias was likely caused by differences inherent to the cdna preparation protocols  <cit> . in a previous study, we also generated different rna-seq libraries to identify bacterial srnas  <cit> . two libraries only included the rna fractions shorter than 500 nt and shorter than 200 nt, respectively. another library contained information on the full transcriptome. almost all previously known srnas and over  <dig> novel intergenic srnas were identified in p. aeruginosa with this approach. there were significant differences in the subset of transcripts detected in each library  <cit> , and the libraries that did not include larger transcripts were clearly superior in detecting srnas. all these investigations underscore the importance of library preparation strategy and relative srna abundance for successful srna detection, and show that in order to increase the number of srnas detected it is required to apply different parallel sequencing strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq was used to identify and quantify  <dig> asrnas in the opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa growing under in  <dig> different conditions, including osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress, and exponential and early stationary phase. due to our library preparation protocol, only asrnas ranging approximately from  <dig> to 500 nt were detected. thus the number of asrnas provided in this study is most likely an underestimate as longer asrnas have not been included. these data are important for the understanding of the regulation of genes that show antisense transcription on the reverse strand. however the large number of asrnas detected makes it difficult to unravel functionality and physiological impacts of antisense transcription, and this paper should therefore be read as a documentation of the potential asrna repertoire from which specific studies can be designed. in addition, we present data showing that in several cases growth conditions impact on the expression levels of asrna, which suggest that at least some of the asrnas may play roles in physiological adaptation to changing conditions. a significant number of asrnas were transcribed opposite to genes involved in cell division and in cell wall, lipopolysaccharide , and capsule biosynthesis. a substantial number of antisense srnas significantly changed their expression during early stationary phase and under osmotic, oxidative and antibiotic stress, suggesting that asrnas may play a regulatory role during these conditions.

finally, we compare our results with those obtained by others in order to document that detection of these new types of potential regulatory molecules is not trivial and that choice of detection and documentation methods is truly important. one of the challenges of performing genome-wide expression studies of srnas is to compare the extremely large data sets resulting from different rna-seq studies, as library preparation protocols, sequencing platforms, and thresholds for detecting transcripts differ from study to study. our comparison of three independent studies that used rna-seq to detect novel asrnas in p. aeruginosa shows that the extent of overlap between the results reported is very limited. it is necessary to address considerations like what is an appropriate threshold of reads for transcript detection, or how reproducibility should be reported in order to avoid misleading conclusions when comparing data generated by non-identical methods. in addition, public databases are already and will be needed for sharing, analyzing, and storing transcriptomic data. apart from sharing and comparing rna-seq data, the validation and functional characterization of the hundreds of novel srnas now being reported will also be a major challenge of current rna research.
