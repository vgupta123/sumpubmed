BACKGROUND
the origin of novel sex pheromone signaling systems may play an important role in insect speciation. insect sex pheromones are volatile compounds or mixtures of such compounds, used in many species for mate location, species recognition, and mate choice  <cit> . in many moths, females produce species-specific chemical cues, and males exhibit species-specific responses  that are important in mate finding. males may also produce pheromones that are used by females in exercising mate choice . these chemical cues are often blends of long-chain hydrocarbons with acetate, alcohol, or aldehyde functional groups. because pheromone biosynthetic pathways have been well characterized  <cit> , it is now possible to examine how changes at the level of protein sequence or gene expression affect pheromone phenotype, patterns of mating, and ultimately, the nature and origin of barriers to gene exchange.

pheromone signaling systems are described as "highly canalized" because changes in production or response are opposed by strong selection against novel phenotypes  <cit> . only if the same genes control signal and response , or if the genes controlling these traits are tightly linked, is coordinated evolution of signal and response thought to be likely. given the diversity of pheromone blends  within closely related groups, it is clear that novel signaling systems arise regularly; however, in moth mating systems studied to date, signal and response genes appear to be unlinked  <cit> . several models have been proposed to explain how novel sex pheromones could evolve without linkage or pleiotropy. in these models, pre-existing variation in either pheromone production or response increases the likelihood that novel pheromone blends or preferences will result in successful mating  <cit> .

moths in the genus ostrinia  have provided an important model system for examining the evolution of pheromone communication  <cit> . in this genus, female pheromone blends are known for many of the species, the biosynthesis of these components is well understood, and differences in pheromone blends between species or strains are consistent with determination by single major genetic factors  <cit> . the principal components of ostrinia female pheromones are unsaturated 14-carbon acetates -11-tetradecenyl or -12-tetradecenyl acetate), which are synthesized from 16c-acids through a series of enzymatic steps that result in chain shortening, desaturation, reduction, and acetylation  <cit> . not only do species differ in pheromone blend, but within the well-studied european corn borer , two distinct "pheromone strains"  occur  <cit> . in the e strain, females produce and males respond to a 99: <dig> mixture of the e and z isomers of d11-14:oac; in the z strain the proportions are reversed and females produce and males respond to a 3: <dig> mixture  <cit> . pheromone blends produced by male hairpencils also differ between strains and species in ostrinia <cit> . although differentiated with respect to pheromone communication, the e and z strains are otherwise difficult to distinguish, using either morphological traits  <cit>  or molecular characters  <cit> . most gene genealogies for ecb do not reveal the two strains to be exclusive groups; only at one locus  and surrounding chromosomal regions is there substantial differentiation .

recent studies of ostrinia pheromones have focused on the diversity of sex pheromone desaturases and their role in the specificity of pheromone production  <cit> . in the european and asian corn borers  the pheromone desaturases, together with desaturases involved in fatty acid metabolism, comprise a large multi-gene family. distinct subfamilies exist that differ in specificity and localization . in ecb, the Δ <dig> desaturase subfamily includes at least  <dig> members, about half of which are full-length copies; the remainder appear to be truncated and lack exon  <dig>  <cit> .

here we produce a Δ <dig> desaturase gene genealogy within ecb, based on sequence from the two putative functional genes found in xue et al.  <cit> . despite the presence of multiple Δ <dig> desaturase gene copies, previous studies of e and z pheromone gland extract suggest that the pheromone strains do not differ in Δ <dig> desaturase enzyme activity  <cit> . we use genealogical methods to confirm whether or not the e and z strains are differentiated at the Δ <dig> desaturase locus. we also examine whether the two functional Δ <dig> desaturase candidates represent gene duplicates or allelic variation at a single locus. finally, we use population genetic methods to ask what has been the history of the gene in ecb. we interpret our results in light of ecb demography and the recent demonstration of a dual function of Δ <dig> desaturase in both male and female pheromone biosynthesis  <cit> .

RESULTS
gene structure and polymorphism
we sequenced  <dig> bps of the Δ <dig> desaturase gene from cdna bps 415- <dig> in  <dig> corn borers . amplification and sequencing from genomic dna, using primers shown in table  <dig>  confirms the presence of two introns. the first, at base pair  <dig>  ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in length, while the second, at base pair  <dig>  ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bps in length . intron length varies due to the presence of multiple indels, some of which are large . figure  <dig> displays the intron length when all indels are coded as a single base. numbering of intron start positions is based on the entire mrna sequence, not coding dna.

mismatches between clade specific primers are in bold.

the amount of polymorphism within our ecb sample set is similar to that found at other ecb loci  <cit> . we find  <dig> polymorphic sites within the  <dig> ecb sequences,  <dig> indel polymorphisms and  <dig> single base substitutions .

analysis of gene genealogies
the Δ <dig> desaturase genealogy does not reveal the two ecb pheromone strains  to be exclusive  groups . there are no fixed nucleotide or fixed indel differences between pheromone strains. the estimated average pairwise distance between e and z populations  is  <dig>  .

the Δ <dig> desaturase maximum parsimony genealogy documents the presence of two major clades  that differ by six insertion/deletions, resulting in an  <dig> bp length difference. these clades do not separate e and z borers, nor do they sort moths based on geographic origins or life cycles . trees based on only intron or only exon sequences show the same deep divergence between the two clades , as do regional trees based on 5', middle and 3' regions of the desaturase gene  and the maximum likelihood genealogy . bootstrap analysis demonstrates that  <dig> % of genealogies include the branch separating the two clades .

the major clades  in the Δ <dig> desaturase genealogy correspond to the two full length Δ <dig> desaturase duplicates  discovered by xue et al  <cit> . alignments of intron  <dig> from clades a and b and from haplotypes s and l show the same pattern of six insertion/deletions, with clade b and haplotype l containing  <dig> additional nucleotides. we find that most  of the  <dig> nucleotide sites in intron  <dig> reported as fixed differences between the s and l sequences by xue et al.  <cit>  are segregating within clades a or b. this discrepancy is likely the result of the increased sample size of moths in our data set. xue et al.  <cit>  found that exon  <dig> was identical in the s and l haplotypes. in contrast, we find that exon sequences also differ between clades a and b. of  <dig> segregating sites in exon  <dig>   <dig> are fixed nucleotide differences between clades. at all  <dig> of these sites, our clade a exon matches the published ecb Δ <dig> desaturase sequence in genbank   <cit> . the exon  <dig> sequences from clade b match two published ecb Δ <dig> desaturase sequences from french populations   <cit> .

evidence for gene duplication?
we tested whether clades a and b represent gene duplicates or allelic variation at a single locus using clade specific pcr. we find that some moths have both a and b haplotypes , whereas other moths appear to have haplotypes that fall into only one clade  . thus, our data fail to show the fixed heterozygote pattern expected for duplicate genes . if we assume that the variation we see is allelic variation at a single locus, then the inferred numbers of genotypes are  <dig> moths homozygous for b,  <dig> homozygous for a, and  <dig> heterozygotes . these genotype frequencies do not include  <dig> of the  <dig> moths. these  <dig> moths were shown, by sequencing  or clade specific pcr , to carry at least one recombinant haplotype.

evidence for recombination
three ecb moths  fail to sort with either of the two major clades , and  are the only haplotypes for which position in the genealogy changes substantially in the three regional Δ <dig> desaturase genealogies . alignment of these sequences suggests that they are recombinant haplotypes,  . repeated amplification and sequencing of these three moths confirms that this is not pcr induced recombination. six additional moths were shown to carry at least one recombinant haplotype by clade specific pcr . for the complete panel of  <dig> moths ,  <dig> haplotypes are from clade b,  <dig> haplotypes are from clade a, with  <dig> presumed recombinant haplotypes. to quantify the amount of recombination indicated by our genealogy, we estimated the minimum number of recombination events  to be  <dig>  <cit>  and the number of crossover events to be  <dig> . we also use c  <cit>  and γ  <cit>  to estimate recombination per base pair, and find these values  to be lower than those estimated for a different ecb sample at the gene encoding pheromone binding protein   <cit> .

polymorphism and genetic distance between clades
despite evidence that clades a and b represent alleles at the same locus, and direct evidence of recombination at this locus, clades a and b retain many fixed differences and little shared polymorphism . only  <dig> of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  are polymorphic in both clades a and b. conversely,  <dig> of these snps segregate within one clade but are not polymorphic in the second clade . the final  <dig> single base substitutions represent fixed differences between the two major clades:  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions in intron  <dig> and  <dig> single nucleotide substitutions in exon  <dig> . of the  <dig> fixed differences in the exon,  <dig> represent fixed amino acid differences: m102i and m149l. these represent conservative changes, inter-conversions among the nonpolar, neutral residues methionine, isoleucine, and leucine. the total number of fixed differences between clades a and b is  <dig> . three additional snps  would be fixed differences if not for ncz <dig>  these may be evidence of a recombination event at the 3' end of ncz <dig> 

these counts do not include the three recombinant sequences; therefore, the total number of polymorphic sites is less than is shown in table  <dig> . also, this analysis omits any sequence position containing a gap and therefore does not include insertion deletion polymorphism. r = replacement substitution and s = silent substitution.

the desaturase gene genealogy is the fifth nuclear gene genealogy for ecb constructed using an almost identical panel of  <dig> moths  <cit> . nucleotide diversity in this genealogy  is within the range defined by previous estimates at the other four loci . the nucleotide diversity within either clade a or b is at the low end of this spectrum , whereas average pairwise distance between clades is at the high end  .

the two asian corn borer  Δ <dig> desaturase sequences fall into opposite clades of the ecb Δ <dig> desaturase genealogy. average pairwise distance between acb and ecb  is comparable to diversity within ecb . the other four ecb nuclear gene genealogies  <cit>  exhibit greater sequence divergence from the outgroup relative to π.

tests of neutrality
we estimated summary statistics to determine if patterns of substitution in the Δ <dig> desaturase genealogy deviate from equilibrium neutral expectations or from those observed at other ecb loci . estimates of tajima's d  <cit>  do not deviate significantly from the neutral expectation, although all estimates are negative, indicating a non-significant excess of low frequency polymorphisms. fu and li's d and f statistics  <cit>  are significantly less than zero  when we choose either of the acb sequences as an outgroup, indicating an excess of mutations on the external branches of the tree .

we compared expected and observed allele frequency spectra  to determine if our sample contains an excess of intermediate frequency alleles as might be expected given the two divergent clades. this analysis confirms the excess of intermediate frequency alleles, and also displays a greater than predicted number of low frequency alleles as suggested by fu and li's test. the Δ <dig> desaturase allele frequency spectrum has a two fold excess of singletons, and three consecutive excesses of intermediate frequency alleles, one of which is three fold greater than the expected allele frequency spectrum. we performed a coalescent simulation to determine whether neutral processes in a population of varying size can account for this bimodal allele frequency spectrum. specifically, a population bottleneck and subsequent expansion can cause estimates like tajima's d to rapidly change in sign and intensity  <cit> . in our coalescent simulation, we find that the incidence of allele frequency spectra that have a two fold excess of singletons and three consecutive excesses of intermediate frequency alleles is rare: with constant population size, only one genealogy in a thousand shows this pattern and for populations that experienced a recent bottleneck/expansion, at most 31/ <dig>  genealogies exhibit bimodality.

discussion
variation at Δ <dig> desaturase does not contribute to current reproductive isolation between e and z moths
at loci that contribute to reproductive isolation between the e and z pheromone strains  we expect to find fixed differences between the e and z strains. absence of differentiation between e and z pheromone strains in the Δ <dig> desaturase genealogy suggests that variation at Δ <dig> desaturase does not contribute to current reproductive isolation between e and z moths. failure of this locus to sort pheromone strains into exclusive groups may reflect shared ancestral polymorphism  <cit>  and/or ongoing hybridization between the pheromone strains. in north america, it is known that hybridization does occur in natural populations  <cit> , but the presence of both a and b haplotypes in acb suggests that the polymorphism has persisted since before the divergence of ecb and acb, which has been estimated to be  <dig> mya  <cit> .

explanations for the existence of discrete a and b clades
clade specific pcr demonstrates that clades a and b of our genealogy represent alleles at a single gene locus and highlights the potential difficulties in distinguishing between gene duplication and allelic variation. several mechanisms may result in the pattern of deep divergence we observe at Δ <dig> desaturase, including past or present balancing selection, population substructure, or changes in population size.

the excess of intermediate frequency alleles apparent in the allele frequency spectrum  is a signature of balancing selection. however, tajima's d and fu and li's d and f statistics do not detect this excess, perhaps because these statistics are counterbalanced by an excess of low frequency alleles or because they lack the power to detect this pattern. one potential explanation for the simultaneous excess of intermediate and low frequency alleles would be the concurrent action of balancing selection and population growth. both a host shift to maize in europe and the subsequent introduction of ecb into north america presumably involved brief population bottlenecks, followed by periods of population growth. another possibility is that selection alone resulted in an excess of low and intermediate frequency alleles; for example, balancing selection could maintain two distinct alleles in the population, both of which are under purifying selection. a third possibility is that the bimodal allele frequency spectrum resulted from neutral processes  in a population of fluctuating size. however, analysis of the allele frequency spectra from data simulated under various population histories shows that a bimodal allele frequency spectrum is rare.

the persistence of discrete clade a and b alleles, in spite of direct evidence for recombination, also suggests selection. using π as an estimate of 4nμ, we find that the number of recombination events per mutation event in the Δ <dig> desaturase gene is low  compared with values for the pbp locus   <cit>  and compared to several genes in d. melanogaster  <cit> . yet estimates of the minimum number of recombination events are the same for both ecb genes , and the  <dig> sequenced recombinant Δ <dig> desaturase alleles show multiple recombination breakpoints. this latter evidence of recombination is not consistent with the low rate of recombination per mutation at the Δ <dig> desaturase locus. instead, the apparent ineffectiveness of recombination may result from selection to maintain two distinct haplotypes. an alternate explanation for these data is that random sampling during a population bottleneck fortuitously increased the frequency of alleles at extreme ends of a polymorphic spectrum, while under-sampling from the "gradient" of haplotypes in between.

long-term balancing selection results in gene genealogies that exhibit trans-specific polymorphism  <cit> . this is the pattern we observe , but given the recent divergence and large ne of ecb and acb, it may be possible that ancestral polymorphisms at neutral sites persist in these sister species resulting in some loci that do not sort haplotypes along species boundaries.

in addition to balancing selection and changing population size, population substructure or recent admixture of isolated populations could also explain the two major clades observed in our genealogy. population substructure and recent admixture seem less likely given that mtdna and the four other nuclear gene loci for which data are available do not display any evidence of a similar deep divergence between two clades . furthermore, clades a and b do not reflect any known ecological or behavioral differences . our clade specific pcr analysis provides additional data confirming that clades a and b do not reflect any known ecological boundaries .

a possible scenario for balancing selection
the hypothesis that balancing selection drives differentiation at this locus, although only one of multiple possibilities, is particularly interesting because it implies a functional difference between the clade a and b Δ <dig> desaturase alleles that is under selection, but does not affect mating phenotype . we find two non-synonymous fixed amino acid differences between clades a and b, but both of these differences are conservative. however, amino acid position responsible for phenotypic differences between clades a and b may be in an exon that was not sequenced for this genealogy.

lassance and löfstedt  <cit>  identify a dual role for the Δ <dig> desaturase enzyme in female and male pheromone production. they suggest the sharing of an enzymatic pathway , but with different substrates in the two sexes. the requirement for a single enzyme to deal with multiple substrates might provide a mechanistic explanation for the maintenance of two different allelic classes in ostrinia populations over considerable evolutionary time. however, in male moths, only z strain males appear to rely on Δ <dig> desaturase for pheromone production  <cit> . in e strain ecb and in acb, males do not use this enzyme for pheromone production. the greater abundance of z strain moths and incomplete reproductive boundaries between the e and z strains may account for persistence of both Δ <dig> desaturase allelic classes in the e strain. however, the balancing selection hypothesis is difficult to rationalize in acb, where neither male nor female moths utilize Δ <dig> desaturase for pheromone production. presence of the two allelic classes in acb could represent ancestral polymorphism. alternatively, the Δ <dig> desaturase may have an additional function, not related to pheromone biosynthesis, which could explain the maintenance of polymorphism in both acb and ecb populations over evolutionary time.

evolution of pheromone mating systems
the presence of two divergent haplotypes at a locus involved in pheromone biosynthesis illustrates how genetic variation can exist in moth mating systems without directly affecting patterns of reproduction. standing variation is a key component in hypotheses about how novel pheromone mating systems evolve in the presence of strong stabilizing selection. for example, variation may exist in the form of rare males with broader pheromone preferences than the rest of the population, which enables them to respond to novel blends  <cit> . in another model, variation exists in the form of silent gene duplicates for which alternate activation may lead to shifts in pheromone biosynthesis  <cit> . in a third model, variation at upstream steps of a pheromone biosynthesis pathway is masked by the action of enzymes downstream in the pathway  <cit> . the Δ <dig> desaturase gene genealogy provides a specific example of another avenue by which variation may be present in pheromone mating systems, either as a result of neutral processes and/or maintainance by selection. the dual role of the Δ <dig> desaturase enzyme in male and female pheromone biosynthesis provides a mechanism by which two divergent haplotypes could be maintained at this locus, and raises the question of whether other enzymes involved in pheromone production also have dual functions and harbor divergent allelic types. most studies of enzymes involved in pheromone biosynthetic pathways in lepidoptera have focused on patterns of variation across species or higher taxa. our results emphasize the importance of also examining patterns of variation within populations or species.

CONCLUSIONS
the two pheromone strains of ostrinia nubilalis are not differentiated at the d <dig> desaturase locus, confirming that the encoded enzyme does not contribute to current reproductive isolation between the two strains. however, the genealogy is characterized by the presence of two divergent clades that differ by many fixed nucleotide substitutions and indels. historical demography cannot easily account for this pattern, and balancing selection may be acting to maintain two distinct allelic classes at this locus. the dual role of Δ <dig> desaturase in both the biosynthetic pathways of male and female pheromone provides a possible functional basis for the maintenance of allelic diversity.
