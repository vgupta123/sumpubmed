BACKGROUND
sialic acids  are negatively charged monosaccharides usually found at the non-reducing end of carbohydrate groups of animal glycoconjugates. sialic acids occur widely in the deuterostome lineage  and they occasionally are encountered in protostomes   <cit> . in vertebrates, sialic acids are either α <dig> - or α <dig> -linked to β-d-galactopyrannose , α <dig> -linked to β-d-n-acetylglucosamine  or β-d-n-acetylgalactosamine  or, α <dig> -linked to another sialic acid forming mono-, oligo- or poly-α <dig> -sialylated  chains . the α <dig> -linked polyneu5ac chain was first described in the polysialoglycoproteins  found in the cortical alveoli of unfertilized eggs of rainbow trout  <cit> . in mammals, psa chains are primarily linked to the n-glycans of the neuronal cell adhesion molecule  and control the early developmental stages of the vertebrate embryo and neurogenesis . more recently, guérardel et al.  <cit>  described a unique oligo- and poly-sialylation pattern on glycoconjugates of zebrafish embryos suggesting that fine tuning of the psa chain length is crucial for fertilization and development. in addition, several structural studies of glycoconjugates in a subset of sea urchin species demonstrated the presence of α <dig> -polysialic acid chains. these observations raised the question of how far back in evolution can the α <dig> -sialyltransferases be traced?

despite low overall sequence identity, all the animal sialyltransferases catalyzing the biosynthesis of sialoglycoconjugates belong to cazy glycosyltransferase-family  <dig>  <cit>  and share four conserved peptide motifs called sialylmotifs l , s , iii and vs   <cit> . these motifs are important for maintenance of the 3-d structure, substrate binding and catalysis  <cit> . moreover, recent studies have identified linkage-specific sequence motifs  in each of the four known sialyltransferase families , that are probably involved in determining linkage specificity and acceptor monosaccharide recognition  <cit> . previously, we reported specific conserved amino acid positions that defined each of the twenty known vertebrate sialyltransferase subfamilies  <cit> . the enzymes of the st8sia family, which mediate the transfer of neu5ac to other neu5ac moieties found in glycoproteins and glycolipids are well described in some deuterostome lineages  <cit> . partial redundancy of enzymatic activities among animal sialyltransferases suggests evolutionary flexibility allowing development of new animal lineages with new sialylated glycoconjugates with potentially new functions  <cit> .

since both uncharacterized sialyltransferases and new sialoglycoconjugates have been described in recent years, one of the major challenges facing glycobiologists is to determine the donor and acceptor specificities of each enzyme. our phylogenetic analysis of the st8sia family suggests the existence of a set of divergent genes found only in the invertebrate deuterostomes strongylocentrotus purpuratus and branchiostoma floridae that we have named st8sia ex. we show that the majority of these st8sia ex genes arose as a result of tandem duplications, from an ancestral st8sia ex gene in the amphioxus lineage that was apparently lost in vertebrates. among the remaining three groups of vertebrate st8sia genes, some subfamilies have emerged as a result of the whole genome duplications   <cit>  and some subfamilies might have disappeared after massive gene loss  <cit> . analysis of orthologous and paralogous relationships of these genes suggests that polysialylation initially appeared in the deuterostome lineage.

RESULTS
identification of st8sia sequences
in order to identify putative genes encoding proteins with significant similarity to st8sia, we carried out blast search using the known vertebrate st8sia sequences. the search was based on the fact that the highly conserved sialylmotif peptide consensus sequences   <cit>  are characteristic of all animal sialyltransferases and consequently serve as hallmarks for their identification. thirty-five vertebrate st8sia sequences and twenty-seven invertebrate st8sia sequences from strongylocentrotus purpuratus and branchiostoma floridae were identified for the first time and are reported in additional file  <dig>  however, due to very low sequence identity within the n-terminal region, the single transmembrane domain present in the vertebrate st8sia protein could not be identified in many of the invertebrate sequences. nevertheless, we could delineate a new st8sia specific family-motif that we named "c-term" . the cysteine residue of this motif forms a conserved intramolecular disulfide bridge with a second conserved cysteine residue located in sialylmotif l. this s-s bond is essential for correct folding and enzymatic activity of st8sia  <cit> . we assessed the orthology of vertebrate and invertebrate sequences by alignment with clustalw, g-blocks selection of informative positions and constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. we found that bony fishes such as zebrafish danio rerio, medaka oryzias latipes, 3-spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus, tetraodonte tetraodon nigroviridis and fugu takifugu rubripes have orthologs of the other mammalian st8sia subfamilies . moreover, two new subfamilies are present in a subset of bony fishes and are named st8sia iii-related  because of their clear sequence relationship to the st8sia iii subfamily and st8sia vii, respectively. two st8sia vii genes are found in a head to tail arrangement on the same chromosome in the zebrafish genome suggesting tandem duplication of these genes. consequently, we named these genes st8sia viia and st8sia viib.

because the greatest number of st8sia genes was found in zebrafish, we analyzed the expression patterns of the st8sia genes in some tissues of this species by rt-pcr . all the st8sia genes were differentially transcribed in various d. rerio adult tissues and in the  <dig> h embryo. however, we did not detect a st8sia viib transcript, which is in agreement with the fact that ests corresponding to this gene were not found in the databanks.

phylogenetic analysis
because of the high degree of similarity within each subfamily of the mammalian st8sia sequences, we used only the bos taurus and homo sapiens amino acid sequences for our initial phylogenetic analysis. moreover, in order to conserve the greatest number of amino acid positions selected by g-blocks  <cit>  some b. floridae and all the s. purpuratus sequences were discarded due to their high sequence divergence. the maximum likelihood tree comprises four main branches supported by bootstrap values greater than 50% .

the first branch, at the origin of the tree, grouped a series of sequences from the cephalochordate b. floridae  indicating that they might share a common ancestor. a second analysis including all the available st8sia sequences was performed with  <dig> g-blocks selected positions. the resulting phylogenetic tree gave the same topology . each of the main branches, except the group st8sia ii/st8sia iv, possesses at least one ortholog in s. purpuratus.

to determine the most probable root of the st8sia family, we rooted the tree with the human sialyltransferase sequences belonging to the st6galnac, st6gal and st3gal gene families . by multiple alignments, g-blocks selection of informative positions, and maximum likelihood tree construction, the topology always confirmed the basal position of the st8sia ex group within the st8sia family. consequently, it would appear that this st8sia ex group has evolved by multiple duplication events in the cephalochordate b. floridae and the echinoderm s. purpuratus, but has disappeared in vertebrates .

the second branch contained all the α <dig> -sialyltransferases, also termed polysialyltransferases, which include the st8sia ii and st8sia iv subfamilies and an additional branch containing the invertebrate sequences from b. floridae . these b. floridae sequences may represent orthologs to the common ancestor of the two st8sia ii and st8sia iv vertebrate subfamilies. from a comparison of the respective amino acid sequences, the invertebrate gene products could not be assigned to either the st8sia ii or st8sia iv subfamilies because they were approximately equally divergent . interestingly, st8sia iv is not found in neognathi genomes, raising the possibility of a gene loss particular to these fish species  <cit>  .

the third branch  contained the vertebrate st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r subfamilies, as well as a group of invertebrate sequences from b. floridae . these invertebrate sequences appear to be orthologues to the common ancestor of the subfamilies st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r that has disappeared in tetrapods. within fish genomes, st8sia iii-r is found only in the neognathi , but not in cyprinidae , nor in salmonidae . it is interesting to note that the species devoid of the st8sia iv gene have the st8sia iii-r gene .

the fourth branch grouped all the vertebrate α <dig> -sialyltransferases subfamilies , which catalyze the transfer of a single sialic acid residue and a new st8sia vii subfamily found in the fishes d. rerio and o. mykiss and the green lizard anolis carolinensis . it was noted that the amphioxus gene product bfl- <dig> branched out before the divergence of these vertebrate subfamilies suggesting that it could represent an ortholog to the common ancestor of the st8sia i, st8sia v, st8sia vi and st8sia vii subfamilies . the st8sia vii subfamily is absent in neognathi .

the st8sia subfamily motifs
as previously described  <cit> , the marine invertebrate st8sia amino acid sequences had intermediate values of subfamily-specific conserved amino acid positions in all the clustalro two by two alignments. in addition, they appeared at the roots of the st8sia ii/st8sia iv branch, the st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r branch and the st8sia i/st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii branch in the phylogenetic tree . we thus looked for peptide motifs that could uniquely represent each of these st8sia groups. we identified a specific motif characteristic of the st8sia ii/st8sia iv group in the b. floridae sequences  . this  motif located upstream of the sialylmotif s  contains the polysialyltransferase domain , a  <dig> amino acid sequence initially described by nakata et al.  <cit>  in the st8sia ii and st8sia iv sequences. the polybasic pstd motif appeared to be a functional motif involved in the elongation of linear chains of sialic acid. in addition, we identified a new specific peptide motif iii- <dig>  located upstream of sialylmotif l and, a new specific peptide motif iii- <dig>  located upstream of sialylmotif s in the amphioxus sequences bfl- <dig> and bfl- <dig> , the sea urchin sequence spu- <dig>  and in all the other members of the vertebrate st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r subfamilies. no peptide sequence motif specific for the mono-α <dig> -sialyltransferases could be identified in the vertebrate st8sia i, st8sia v, st8sia vi and st8sia vii subfamilies, nor in the corresponding b. floridae and s. purpuratus sequences. similarly, no distinguishing motif could be defined for the marine invertebrate sequences belonging to the st8sia ex group.

analysis of conserved gene synteny and orthology
in order to explain the appearance of the eight vertebrate st8sia subfamilies, we further analyzed the evolutionary history of st8sia in the context of the two rounds of whole genome duplications   <cit> , tandem duplication of genes, gene loss, synteny and datation. the same chromosomal location of st8sia iii and st8sia v on human chromosome 18q is indicative of a tandem duplication that dates back at least to the osteichthyan emergence, since this tandem position is also found in chicken  and in medaka . there is an overall conservation of syntenic organization around these two genes in these three organisms. in d. rerio and in t. rubripes, the syntenic region is spread over three different chromosomes or scaffolds . moreover, two copies of st8sia iii are included in two paralogons on o. latipes chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .

furthermore, scaffold  <dig> of b. floridae contains genes belonging to the st8sia ex group defined by phylogeny, orthologous sequences for st8sia ii/iv , for st8sia iii/iii-r  and for their neighboring genes . this denotes the common origin of these st8sia genes from an old conserved synteny and suggests a series of tandem duplications. however, scaffold  <dig> lacks the region around st8sia v. finally, we found statistically significant human paralogons  containing the st8sia ii and st8sia iv genes described by mclysaght et al.  <cit>  on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . these two st8sia genes share a conserved syntenic relationship from fish to mammals  <cit>  and our results suggest that they might have arisen from a common invertebrate ancestor .

time of gene duplication and evolutionary history of the st8sia family
in order to estimate the time of divergence of the vertebrate st8sia subfamilies, we reconstructed linearized trees for duplicate genes under the assumption of a molecular clock. the results are given in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  it appears that the equations fall into  <dig> groups. the first group contains the subfamilies st8sia ii and st8sia iv, the second contains the subfamilies st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r, and the third contains the subfamilies st8sia i, st8sia v, st8sia vi and st8sia vii. a comparison of the regression slopes between pairs of groups reveals that the st8sia i/st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii has a significantly lower slope than that of the st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r group  and slightly lower to that of st8sia ii/st8sia iv . however, branch-site test does not show a positive selection in any st8sia subfamily, even in the st8sia vi group, where the highest evolution rate is recorded . the earliest node datations refer to the duplications between st8sia i and st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii and between st8sia v and st8sia vi/st8sia vii, around  <dig> and  <dig> mya respectively . we estimate that the duplications between st8sia ii and st8sia iv and between st8sia vi and st8sia vii took place about  <dig> mya. the latest duplication event was estimated to be around  <dig> mya and corresponds to the divergence between st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r.

for the  <dig> genes belonging to the different subfamilies,  <dig> codons have been taken into account; κ corresponds to estimated transition over transversion ratio and ω to dn/ds;  branches of interest,  background branches.

discussion
model of divergent evolution with punctual areas of gene loss and birth
our investigations have established an orthologous relationship between the mammalian st8sia genes and their invertebrate deuterostome counterparts. to date, st8sia genes have been identified only in the deuterostome lineage, and no st8sia sequences have been identified in the roundworm c. elegans nor in insects such as honey bee, mosquito or fruit fly  <cit> . the current paradigm of wgd predicts a first round of duplication after the emergence of vertebrates but before the separation between agnathans and gnathostomes, followed by a second round of duplication after this divergence  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we propose a scenario that illustrates how the st8sia gene family might have evolved, that is consistent with their phylogenetic relationships, with synteny, with the paralogon analysis, and tandem duplication or wgd and gene loss  <cit> . since genes within the st8sia ex, st8sia ii/iv and st8sia iii/iii-r groups are located on the same scaffold  <dig> of amphioxus  , we hypothesize that they resulted from tandem duplications, which occurred before the separation of cephalochordates and vertebrates. the st8sia iii and st8sia v genes are on the same chromosome from fish to humans indicating that they originated from a second ancient tandem duplication . phylogenetic analyses revealed that the duplication order is st8sia ex > st8sia ii/st8sia iv > st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r > st8sia i/st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii. within this last group, successive duplications took place early in the vertebrate lineage leading to the emergence of st8sia i, st8sia v, st8sia vi and st8sia vii. based on the present vertebrate genome data, the chromosomal segment bearing the ancestor of st8sia ii/st8sia iv, st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r, st8sia vi/st8sia vii and st8sia i migrated to four different chromosomes early in the differentiation of the vertebrate phylum . unequivocal paralogons including the st8sia ii and st8sia iv genes were found between the human chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>  and we identified an ortholog to st8sia iv in the lamprey  suggesting that these genes result from a block duplication that occurred before the divergence between gnathostomes and agnathans. the association of this event with the first round of wgd is supported by the datation of around  <dig> mya, close to wgd r <dig>  <cit> . the duplication event within the st8sia vi/st8sia vii group dates back around  <dig> mya, but unfortunately, no paralogon around these genes could be identified making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the mechanism involved in the emergence of both genes. paralogons observed in medaka  and topology of the phylogenetic tree shown in fig.  <dig> indicates that st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r genes result from a block duplication, probably related to wgd r <dig>   <cit> , and not to the more recent wgd r <dig> , around  <dig> mya  <cit> . the two rounds of wgd should have generated twenty genes, but only eight of them remained in the living vertebrate species. notably, species specific tandem duplications have resulted in duplicated genes:  st8sia viia and st8sia viib in d. rerio and a. carolinensis, that are organized head to tail on the same chromosome  st8sia via and st8sia vib in t. rubripes and  st8sia iia and st8sia iib genes in o. mykiss  <cit> . considering the order of the successive duplications and the presence of genes orthologous to st8sia ex, st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r and st8sia i/st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii in the sea urchin , we deduced that these duplications date back to the common ancestor of sea urchin and vertebrates, early in the deuterostome lineage. in addition, the absence of an ortholog to st8sia ii/st8sia iv in s. purpuratus might result from a gene loss. similarly, the absence of the st8sia ex counterparts in vertebrates is certainly due to a gene loss in their common ancestor . moreover, the absence of any st8sia gene in the tunicate genomes  can be explained in the context of their probable ancestral colinearity by a single deletion of the st8sia cluster. in summary, a series of ancient gene duplications and the two wgds account for much of the st8sia gene diversity in vertebrates. in contrast, the expansion and subsequent divergence of the vertebrate fucosyltransferase genes appears to primarily be the consequence of wgd r <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> .

diversification of functions
the vertebrate enzymes of the st8sia family catalyze the transfer of sialic acid in an α <dig> -linkage to other sialic acid residues present in glycoproteins and glycolipids  <cit> . we describe here for the first time the st8sia ex family, a new group of genes restricted to the non-vertebrate marine deuterostomians bfl and spu. these putative gene products possess all the characteristic peptide motifs of the st8sia family  <cit> , including the new c-term motif, suggesting that they might have α <dig> -sialyltransferase activity. the presence in sea urchin of novel polysialylated structures such as α <dig> -linked polysialic acid chains  <cit>  or n sequences, where n ranges from  <dig> to more than  <dig>  <cit>  raises the question of the role played by st8sia ex gene products in their biosynthetic pathway. the region in the st8sia ex amino acid sequences corresponding to the pstd motif found in the polysialyltransferases st8sia ii/st8sia iv is quite different from the consensus pstd motif, suggesting that these enzymes might carry out a different form of sialylation . in addition, α <dig> -linked polysialylated structures were also described in mouse neuroblastoma cells  <cit> , but no ortholog to st8sia ex could be identified in the mouse genome suggesting that the st8sia ex genes might have evolved in invertebrate deuterostomes to achieve a novel sialylation.

the st8sia ii/st8sia iv group characterized by a pstd is found from cephalochordates to mammals. in vertebrates, st8sia ii and st8sia iv can assemble long, linear polysialic acid chains  on the n-glycans of the neural cell adhesion molecule n-cam and also on the polysialoglycoprotein  in fish eggs  <cit> . in spite of the lack of data on the presence of α <dig> -sialylation in the glycoconjugates of amphioxus, we predict that these polysialylated structures exist because several genes of b. floridae code for putative proteins possessing the pstd-like motif. yet, no such polysialylated structure has been found in sea urchin  glycoconjugates, a fact correlated with the absence of st8sia ii/st8sia iv genes in this genome. however, an α <dig> -polysialyltransferase activity has been demonstrated in another developmentally regulated sea urchin species , with a peak at the gastrula stage  <cit> . in this species, the enzyme activity is probably associated with the migration or movements of cells during gastrulation. this is comparable with the role that polysialylation serves in increasing neuronal plasticity and migration in embryonic vertebrates  <cit> , through the modification of n-cam. two enzymes, st8sia ii and st8sia iv that carry out the polysialylation of the n-glycans of n-cam are present in most vertebrates. for example, the temporal pattern of expression of the st8sia ii gene is restricted to the early development stages. in contrast, st8sia iv is expressed at lower levels from the later stages of development to adulthood  <cit> . this can be related to a weaker selective pressure on st8sia iv than on st8sia ii, as illustrated by longer branch lengths corresponding to higher mutation rates .

mammalian st8sia iii was shown to add α <dig> -linked sialic acid to terminal α <dig> -linked sialic acid of glycolipids and glycoproteins, resulting in mono- to oligo-α <dig> -sialylation of n-glycans of glycoproteins , with the notable exception of those of n-cam  <cit> . in addition, the human enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of short sialyl-oligomers  suggesting that st8sia iii is an oligosialyltransferase  <cit> . the protein sequences of the st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r group show the same evolutionary rate as those of the st8sia ii/st8sia iv group. in zebrafish, the st8sia iii gene is mainly expressed in the  <dig> h post fertilization embryo with a lower of expression in the adult brain . it also exhibits a restricted expression in mouse, notably in brain and testes  <cit> . interestingly, up to date, we described the st8sia iii-r gene in the neognathi bony fishes, animal species in which the st8sia iv gene is missing, which suggests that st8sia iii-r might replace st8sia iv activity . it can be excluded that both subfamilies are orthologous given the nearly 100% bootstrap value associated to the branch common to st8sia iii and st8sia iii-r.

phylogenetic analysis indicates that the genes of the st8sia i/st8sia v/st8sia vi/st8sia vii group evolved faster than the other st8sia genes because they form longer branches. among them, st8sia vi has the highest mutation rate, not associated with positive selection as indicated by a dn/ds ratio <  <dig>  and it shows a low level of basal expression in zebrafish tissues . the mammalian st8sia vi transfers only one sialic acid residue and synthesizes disialylated structures on o-glycans  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the st8sia vii gene is restricted to a subset of non-mammalian vertebrates, which include the lamprey , teleosteans , and the green lizard  and it exhibits remarkable tissue specific expression pattern in zebrafish, primarily in the ovary and intestine . the enzymatic activity of this enzyme is not known, but we hypothesize that it could be a mono-α <dig> -sialyltransferase responsible for the particular disialylated structures  recently described in d. rerio  <cit> . in this gene group, the two last members st8sia i and st8sia v have the same expression profile in zebrafish . both enzymes are involved in ganglioside biosynthesis. st8sia i transfers one sialic acid residue to the α <dig> -linked sialic acid residue of gm <dig> to make gd <dig>  <cit>  whereas st8sia v synthesizes gd1c, gt1a, gq1b and gt <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic analysis we have presented gives new insights into the events leading to a birth and death model for the evolution of the genes encoding α <dig> -sialyltransferases. much of the diversity is due to gene duplication events occurring early in the deuterostome lineage, most likely rapidly after the emergence of an ancestral st8sia gene. based on results from this study we propose that the newly identified, novel st8sia ex gene group in the invertebrate genomes is a candidate ancestral st8sia gene. the assembly of polysialic acid glycans on glycoconjugates took place very early in animal evolution , with the emergence of the st8sia ii/st8sia iv group early in the evolution of deuterostomes  followed by the emergence of the st8sia iii/st8sia iii-r group. the relative conservation of the pstd-like motif in these latter sequences  and the fact that st8sia iii may drive oligosialylation of glycoconjugates, further suggests that st8sia iii-r might also be involved in oligosialylation . in contrast, the group of mono α <dig> -sialyltransferases  underwent significant modifications in the pstd-like motif. the rapid mutation rate throughout these vertebrate sequences led to novel α <dig> -sialylation changes with respect to the length of the α <dig> -sialic acid chains assembled and their association with specific acceptor substrates, including o-glycans .
