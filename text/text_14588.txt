BACKGROUND
bone morphogenic proteins  are members of the transforming growth factor-β  family. mammalians encode and express more than a dozen bmps. two members, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  are in clinical use for the treatment of bone fractures providing evidence for the therapeutic application of bmps to regulate the viability and differentiation of osteoblasts  <cit> , which might be of strong interest for other human cell types; in particular for those in the nervous system. bmps play an important role during development of the nervous system  <cit> . in adults, they stimulate adult neurogenesis, exert a neuroprotective effect, and stimulate the regeneration of neurons  <cit> . in models of ischemic stroke bmp <dig> reduced the infarct size  <cit>  and improved functional recovery at delayed time points after stroke  <cit> . bmp <dig> also exerted neuroprotective effects in models of parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury  <cit> . in addition, bmp <dig> had neuroprotective properties in vitro <cit>  and stimulated angiogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and neurite outgrowth  <cit> . although bmp <dig> is upregulated after cerebral ischemia  <cit> , its function as an endogenous neuroprotectant is controversial since recombinant soluble noggin, an antagonist of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  demonstrates neuroprotective effects in models of stroke  <cit> .

a major obstacle for the therapeutic use of bmps is the short half-life of the peptides; in the case of bmp <dig> about  <dig> min  <cit> , precluding intravenous administration for chronic conditions. transplanted cells secreting bmps or noggin can be one option to solve this issue  <cit>  but viral gene therapy using lentiviruses or recombinant adeno-associated viruses  might open an attractive, well-defined alternative option for providing constant supply of recombinant bmp  <cit> .

in this study we used raavs to express bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and noggin in the brain of mice since raavs enable efficient gene delivery in the cns without inducing toxic or inflammatory responses  <cit> . for visual inspection of raav encoded gene transduction we expressed bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and noggin as fusion with a fluorescent protein  using the ribosomal skipping 2a peptide bridge from thosea asigna virus  <cit> . in contrast to conventional techniques, such as the internal ribosomal entry site , bidirectional and dual promoters, or co-infection of several viruses, the ribosomal skipping leads to nearly equimolar ratios of the 2a-linked proteins  <cit> .

in this study we demonstrate that bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  or the inhibitor noggin can be functionally expressed by raav encoded, 2a fused open reading frames together with fluorescent reporter proteins. when released from the 2a linked reporter proteins during protein translation, bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and noggin are secreted and are functionally active. we found that raav-delivered bmp <dig> exerted neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo suggesting that this might represent a new approach for long-term administration of bmp <dig> in neurological diseases.

RESULTS
expression of secreted morphogenic proteins and 2a-linked venus
to analyze whether bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin can be functionally expressed in raav encoded gene transfer experiments we generated several raav vectors by linking the secretory proteins bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin via the 2a peptide to the cytosolic fluorescent protein venus  <cit>  or to tdtomato   <cit>  in a single open reading frame .

for the functional analysis of the raav vectors in neurons we first infected primary neurons by raavs encoding the viral bmps  and viral noggin  . seven days post infection  cell culture medium  contained a major amount of mature v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig>  and v-noggin as revealed by immunoblots using an anti-2a antibody selective for  <dig> amino acids of 2a-peptides that remained at the c-terminus of v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin after successful ribosomal skipping . for noggin, three bands were visualized in immunoblots of cell lysates corresponding to the unmodified protein , the glycosylated protein , and the mature protein . in addition, in cell lysates the anti-2a antibody detected the bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> precursors, in the range of the predicted molecular weight  of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, respectively. the anti-2a antibody also detected a noggin-immunosignal at about  <dig> kda, which might indicate residual noggin-2a-venus fusion proteins that escaped the ribosomal skip. however, the anti-gfp antibody revealed only minor amounts  of bmp7-2a-venus and bmp2-2a-venus full-length proteins but no noggin-2a-venus fusion. this suggests that the 53-kda immunosignal for noggin in the supernatant represents noggin dimers that can be detected under low stringent reducing conditions during electrophoresis  <cit> . thus, the ribosomal skipping and the secretion of the target proteins encoded by the raavs were very efficient. the minor amount of mature factors that can be detected in the lysates of neurons is most likely due to the crude, one-step separation procedure of supernatants and lysates. in contrast to the almost complete secretion of bmps and noggin, the secreted venus  which contains the n-terminal signal sequence of noggin  was only partially secreted and equal amounts of svenus were found in the supernatant and cell lysate using the venus cross reactive anti-gfp antibody .

the immunocytology of raav-infected primary cortical neurons on dpi  <dig> was in accordance with the concept that 2a-tagged v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin entered the secretory pathway in raav transduced cells, since the 2a immunoreactivity for all three factors showed nuclear exclusion . the immunofluorescence was associated with cell membranes, whereas the signal in v-venus transduced neurons was localized mainly in the cytosol indicating that low expression of the virally transduced factors is not the reason for nuclear exclusion of their 2a immunoreactivity. a similar change in the distribution of the venus fluorescence was found when the fluorescence patterns of virally delivered svenus and venus  were compared . therefore, we conclude that the subcellular immunosignal distributions of 2a-linked secreted and cytosolic proteins indicate an efficient secretion of the secreted proteins in 2a based polycistrons.

efficient expression of 2a-linked secretory proteins in vivo
we aimed to use the raavs for the delivery of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin in the adult brain. therefore, we examined the efficiency of the 2a-mediated co-expression and ribosomal skipping of 2a-linked raav-encoded proteins in the brain in vivo. we injected raav-bmp7-2a-venus, raav-bmp2-2a-venus, raav-noggin-2a-venus, raav-venus and raav-svenus into the cortex  and hippocampus  of adult c57bl6/n mice. at dpi  <dig> we detected similar venus fluorescence intensity specifically in raav injected brain regions for all raavs . the immune-histological staining with anti-gfp and anti-2a antibodies showed cytosolic venus expression whereas v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin immunosignals were nuclear excluded and were associated with the cell membranes . a similar cellular distribution could be observed for v-svenus and v-venus in the hpc . this strongly suggests that the secretion of the raav expressed v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin is indicated by their membrane associations. the cellular resolution of v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin in the stratum radiatum revealed that glia as well as neurons express the raav delivered morphogenic factors . since the ubiquitous cag promoter controls the expression of the raav delivered 2a-linked morphogenic factors the astroglial expression was expected.

in crude hippocampal extracts mature v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin could be detected together with their v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> precursors and noggin dimer of v-nogin . as already noticed in virally transduced primary neurons , the electrophoretic mobility of the v-bmp <dig> precursor  is slower than expected . since this slower mobility of the v-bmp <dig> 45-kda precursor was consistently observed in different expression systems this might be an intrinsic property of the v-bmp <dig> precursor in our electrophoretic system.

2a-released secretory proteins are biologically active
to analyze whether 2a-tagged v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin expressed in brain cells are bioactive we analyzed v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin induced smad1/5/ <dig> phosphorylation, the neuroprotection afforded by v-bmp <dig> against h2o <dig> toxicity and the v-bmp <dig> activation of the bmp <dig> bre:gfp reporter gene in the bmp reporter mouse brains  <cit> .

first, we collected at different time point cell culture supernatants from pcn that express v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig>  and v-noggin and compared their immunoreactivity to commercially available morphogenic proteins. thus, anti-bmp <dig> detected r- and v-bmp <dig> and anti-noggin r- and v-noggin in immunoblots  whereas the anti-bmp <dig> could only be used in elisa for v-bmp <dig> detection  demonstrating immune-cross-reactivity of homologous recombinant and virally expressed morphogenic proteins. most of r-bmp <dig> and r-noggin were found in the fully reduced form with the expected molecular weights of  <dig>  and  <dig> kda, respectively. the cystines containing forms of bmp <dig> and noggin exhibit reduced sds-page electrophoretic mobility and are the dominant isoforms for v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin . substantial amounts of v-bmp <dig>  v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin b could be detected in pcn culture media when compared to the recombinant morphogenic proteins in the same immunoblot .

we treated pcn with conditioned supernatants of pcn cultures  since it was documented that bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> stimulate the phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig>  whereas noggin inhibits the formation of psmad  <cit> . as controls we applied recombinant r-bmp <dig>  r-bmp <dig>  r-noggin  and supernatant from non-transfected pcn. the smad1/5/ <dig> specific immunoblots showed that r-bmps and v-bmps increased the level of psmad  <dig> h after stimulation whereas supernatants from v-noggin or v-venus expressing cells and uninfected cells did not increase psmad1/5/ <dig> levels . the identical treatment of hela cells provided a similar result . in hela cells the v- and r-bmp <dig> stimulation induced higher psmad1/5/ <dig> levels than v- and r-bmp <dig>  the v- and r-noggin treated hela cells showed lower psmad1/5/ <dig> levels than hela cells stimulated with conditioned supernatants harvested from venus expressing or uninfected pcn . thus, the efficient stimulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> by v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> strongly suggested that the 2a-tagged v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> are secreted as bioactive proteins from raav infected pcn.

since our goal was the application of the virally delivered bmps for neuroprotection and since reactive oxygen species are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of several brain disorders, including stroke, we exposed primary cortical neurons to h2o <dig> investigating the protective activity of raav-delivered bmp <dig>  on day in vitro   <dig> we treated pcn with h2o <dig> and 24 h later we measured the cell toxicity indicator lactate dehydrogenase  in the supernatant of pcn cultures. as shown in figure 3d h2o <dig> exposure induced neuronal toxicity in a h2o <dig> concentration-dependent manner. for the subsequent experiments we used  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> that induced about 30 % of the global toxicity obtained by 1 m h2o <dig> exposure. treatment with r-bmp <dig> itself  did not affect ldh release . however, treatment of div  <dig> neurons with r-bmp <dig>  30 min before h2o <dig> exposure significantly reduced h2o2-induced ldh levels in the medium . interestingly, infection of pcn with raav-bmp7-2a-venus at div  <dig> also protected pcn from h2o2-induced exposure at div  <dig> . these results indicate that, given shortly before the noxious stimulus or chronically administered by raav delivery several days before h2o <dig> treatment, v-bmp <dig> has protective properties in primary neurons.

to provide additional evidence for the bioactive expression of v-bmps in the adult brain we injected raav-bmp2-2a-tdtomato into the hippocampus and cortex of bre:gfp reporter mice  <cit> . two weeks after raav delivery we detected the majority of gfp positive cells in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus  in addition to some sparse gfp immunopositive neurons and glia in the cortex at the injection site . the presence of the gfp immunopositive cells could not be observed in pbs-infected bre:gfp mice  suggesting that the virally delivered v-bmp <dig> is functionally active. the poor gfp expression by raav transduced v-bmp <dig> might reflect the low sensitivity of the bre:gfp reporter in brain tissue, since injection of r-bmp <dig> did lead to gfp positive cells  <dig> or 48 h after injection of rbmp <dig> . thus, in summary, our results collectively show that bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and can be expressed and secreted as native peptides in neuronal cultures and in adult brains as raav encoded 2a fusions.

virally expressed bmp <dig> has a neuroprotective effect in mcao
to study the neuroprotective effects of v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> in adult mice we aimed to analyze whether v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> can decrease the infarct size after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery  in adult mice. since the stereotactic delivery of raav in adult mice is restricted to the injection site of the virus  we injected raav into the lateral ventricle and the hippocampi of newborn  mice for robust virally mediated gene expression  <cit> . injected mice did not show behavioral abnormalities during adolescence and adulthood. in sagittal, immunhistological brain sections of p <dig> injected mice robust and widespread expression of nuclear excluded, membrane-attached v-bmp <dig> and v-bmp <dig> could be visualized 8 weeks after raav injection with strongest expression in neurons of the cortex and the hippocampus . in contrast to adult raav injected mice  the expression of the raav-encoded 2a-linked morphogenic factors was restricted to neurons with very few raav expressing astroglia .

in a second cohort of eight-week-old mice injected at p <dig> with raav-bmp7-2a-venus, raav-bmp2-2a-venus, raav-noggin-2a-venus and raav-venus mcao was performed. in this model of ischemic strokes, infarcts are mainly limited to the cortex. when cortical infarct volumes were quantified 48 h after mcao, raav-mediated overexpression of v-bmp <dig> v-bmp7), significantly reduced infarct volumes, whereas the raav mediated expression of v-venus, v-bmp <dig> and v-noggin did not alter infarct volumes . in another independent experimental group, we confirmed the protective effect of v-bmp <dig> in mcao v-bmp7) and showed in these mice that v-bmp <dig> did not affect the cerebral blood flow . to further investigate the protective properties of v-bmp <dig> in vivo, we analyzed neuronal apoptosis after mcao in eight-week-old p <dig> raav-bmp7-2a-venus injected animals. apoptosis was evaluated in the periphery of the ischemic area by tunel staining on coronal sections at the level of the anterior commissure. we detected significantly fewer tunel-positive cells in mice expressing v-bmp <dig> compared to raav-venus infected or naïve mice .

our results indicate that raav-induced neuronal overexpression of bmp <dig> is protective in mcao and that raav-mediated polycistronic gene transfer can be applied to study cerebral ischemia in vivo.

discussion
the morphogenic protein bmp <dig> has neuroprotective properties in vitro. however, in vivo administration is limited by the short half-life and the large amounts of biologically active bmp <dig> that need to be administered   <cit> , which might explain why recombinant bmp <dig> reduced the infarct volume in some, but not all experimental stroke studies  <cit> . using raav expressed bmp <dig> we observed a 2-fold reduction in the infarct size, suggesting that raav vectors represent a superior mode for the delivery of biological active bmp <dig>  previous work has revealed an anti-apoptotic effect of bmp <dig> in neurons in vitro <cit> . our work extends this finding, demonstrating that bmp <dig> reduces apoptotic cell death in vivo as raav expression of bmp <dig> significantly decreased the number of tunel-positive cells in the periphery of the ischemia.

in contrast to a previous study  <cit> , the viral expression of noggin, an extracellular inhibitor of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  had no effect on the infarct size although we verified that the raav expressed noggin was bioactive by decreasing the level of smad phosphorpylation of hela cells. besides the different time points for the analysis after mcao  a lower expression level of biological active noggin in our system cannot be excluded. similarly, low expression levels of v-bmp <dig> might be responsible for the lack of neuroprotection in our mcao experiments.

our study was not designed to analyze long-term effects of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin, but rather was designed to propose a convenient, reliable route for prolonged delivery of short-lived peptide hormones. future work will be required to explore the potential of bmps and bmp inhibitors in regenerative treatment of stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. similarly, a paracrine or autocrine neuroprotective activity of the v-bmp <dig> needs to be investigated in future studies, using neuron specific raav vectors.

our study illustrates that 2a-tagged bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin can be co-expressed in 2a-linked fusions with a reporter protein in neurons using raavs as gene transfer vectors. in cells of adult mouse brains the 2a induced ribosomal skip  <cit>  was very efficient and no full-length 2a-fusion protein composed of the secretory polypeptides, the 2a peptide linker and venus could be detected in adult mouse brains. after or during translation the n-terminal secretory protein precursors and the c-terminal reporter protein were differentially sorted as separated proteins into the cytosol or functionally assembled in secretory pathways indicating that the c-terminally attached 2a peptide did not inhibit the bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and noggin bioactivity and that v-bmp <dig> is similar active as r-bmp <dig> in vitro <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
polycistronic expression of 2a-linked peptide hormones and a reporter gene using raavs provide a convenient and promising gene therapeutic tool for the genetic delivery of neuroprotective factors.
