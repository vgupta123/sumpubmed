BACKGROUND
recent developments in genome-wide computational analyses have successfully identified causal interactions  <cit> , and showed promise in the identification of dysregulated genes in development and tumor progression pathways  <cit> . for example, a computational analysis procedure was applied to identify the mrs causally linked to the activation of a specific gene set, mesenchymal gene expression signature , in human malignant glioma  <cit> . indeed,  <dig> tfs were obtained by the aracne algorithm and the mges enrichment test, and among them, the top  <dig> tfs with the largest fraction of mges genes were experimentally controlled, as the mr candidates. finally,  <dig> of the top  <dig> tfs, stat <dig> and cebpb, were experimentally verified as mrs of mesenchymal transformation. unfortunately, the computational method employed in the previous work was unsophisticated and required further improvement. for example, it is unclear why the method selected the top  <dig> tfs from  <dig> tfs, rather than  <dig> or  <dig> tfs. although the coverage of the tfs for the mges genes was carefully considered, there was no rational criterion for the final selection of the mr candidates. furthermore, aracne considers the relationships between three genes for selecting mr candidates. however, there are some well known mathematical techniques that consider multiple relationships and have been applied to infer regulatory networks  <cit> .

we previously reported  <dig> candidates of active networks for diabetes progression in the goto-kakizaki rat , which were identified by network screening, in comparison with the wistar-kyoto  rat  <cit> . network screening is a procedure to extract the regulatory networks activated under particular conditions, based on the known regulatory networks  <cit> . the candidates were characterized by the known biological pathways that were consistent with the previous knowledge about diabetes. unfortunately, the plausibility of the active networks could not be verified experimentally. this was partly because the results were presented in a metaphysical form, and as the biological pathway, instead of the list of concrete target genes. actually, the active networks were composed of many genes that were not amenable to experimental verification.

to overcome these problems, we recently developed a procedure for identifying mr candidates, by a combination of network screening and network inference  <cit> . the network screening strongly depends on the previous knowledge of the regulatory networks. to compensate for the limitations of network screening, we introduced a network inference method, which is a version of a path consistency algorithm   <cit>  or a modified pc-a  <cit>  that applies pc-a to biological data with high redundancy. the performance of our procedure was tested for mrs in human malignant glioma, using the same data set in ref.  <cit> , and worked well  <cit> . in total,  <dig> tfs and  <dig> tfs were detected by the network screening and the network inference, respectively, and  <dig> tfs overlapped between them. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> tfs were stat <dig> and cebpb, which were verified experimentally as the master regulators in the previous report  <cit> .

in this paper, we sought to identify the candidates of master regulators for diabetes progression, using the spontaneous diabetic gk rat model. based on the networks specific to diabetes progression identified in our previous report  <cit>  and the networks inferred by the modified pc-a, we intended to narrow down the candidate molecules responsible for diabetes further, by identifying the master regulators that play a central role in diabetes progression in gk rats. furthermore, we improved our previous method  <cit>  to narrow down the candidates in a more reliable manner, by considering the coverage of a tf for its regulated genes in a statistical manner, in addition to the specificity of the tf to the target biological phenomena. as expected from the previous case of the computational identification of mrs in a human brain tumor  <cit>  and the present improvements, we identified a limited set of reliable mr candidates, and thus provided information for further experimental design for candidate verification.

RESULTS
overview of our computational procedure
in our computational procedure, we identified mr candidates by two approaches, which are schematically shown in figure  <dig>  one is a knowledge-based approach, which estimates the consistency of the network structures among the known networks with the measured data   <cit> . the other is a data-driven inference approach, which estimates the conditional independency between the genes by calculating the partial correlation coefficients   <cit> . in both cases, we further selected the mr candidates by considering the enrichment of the gene expression signature in the networks. finally, we refined the candidates by considering the tf specificity and the regulated-gene coverage. the details are described in the methods.

mr candidates detected by network screening
in our previous study  <cit> , we used network screening to identify  <dig> networks for gk and wky rats in three growth periods: 4w, from 8w to 12w, and from 16w to 20w, among the  <dig>  networks in the reference network set. based on these results, we further selected the mr candidates. from the  <dig> networks, in total, we extracted  <dig> binary relationships of tfs and their regulated genes, which were specifically found in the three periods for gk and wky rats, under the condition that the gene expression shows a difference with a false discovery rate  of less than  <dig> , between the two strains of rats for each period . the numbers of genes specifically found in each period in gk and wky rats are as follows:  <dig> genes at the period of 4w in gk;  <dig> at 8w and 12w in gk;  <dig> at 16w and 20w in gk;  <dig> at the period of 4w in wky;  <dig> at 8w and 12w in wky; and  <dig> at 16w and 20w in wky. note that some tf-gene relationships emerged iteratively for different periods in gk and wky rats.

among the tf-gene relationships selected above, the tfs were narrowed down in two ways. first, the tf-gene relationships were selected by the specificity, which means that the tfs emerge only in gk, but not in wky. as a result, we found a total of  <dig> tfs, as shown in table  <dig>  second, the tf-gene relationships were selected by the coverage, which means how many genes the tfs regulate, among the genes in the expression signature. the tfs thus selected were sorted according to the coverage, and then the mr candidates were further selected by a statistical test  for each period in gk and wky listed in table  <dig>  as seen in the table, most of the tfs emerged in both gk and wky, in terms of the coverage selection. we finally found  <dig> tfs  among the genes by the initial selection in table  <dig> 

all of the gene names are cited from the rat genome database http://rgd.mcw.edu/ in all of the tables, the figures, and the text.

tfs found in both gk and wky are indicated by bold letters.

mr candidates inferred by the modified path consistency algorithm
we first inferred six networks of all genes on the microarray for each of the three periods in gk and wky rats, by the modified path consistency algorithm  <cit> , and then the tf-gene relationships were extracted from each network. after the extraction, only the relationships that included the genes with a significant difference between gk and wky rats were further selected for the  <dig> sets of relationships.

using the same procedure as that described in the preceding subsection, the tfs were narrowed down. first, we chose the relationships in terms of the gene-emergence specificity. as a result,  <dig> tfs were identified as the mr candidates in table  <dig>  the number of candidates seems to be large, even in comparison with the candidate number,  <dig> tfs, in the previous case of the brain tumor  <cit> . while one network was considered to identify the candidates in the previous paper, three networks for the three periods in gk rats were surveyed to select the candidates in the present study. thus, the number of tfs extracted from one network,  <dig> tfs on average, is similar to that in the previous study. second, the tf-gene relationships were selected by the coverage. we chose the tf-gene relationships by a statistical test  for each period in gk and wky, as shown in table  <dig>  in contrast to the coverage selection in network screening, only a few tfs emerged in both gk and wky. indeed, among the  <dig> tfs in table  <dig>  only two tfs  emerged in both gk and wky. finally, we found  <dig> tfs as mr candidates.

tfs found in both gk and wky are indicated by bold letters.

mr selection by comparison of the tf sets detected by the two methods
we obtained the final mr candidates by selecting the overlapped tfs detected by the two methods in terms of two criteria , as shown in table  <dig>  indeed,  <dig> tfs detected by network screening in terms of specificity overlapped with only  <dig> tfs  and  <dig> tfs  by the modified path consistency algorithm by two criteria, respectively. in contrast,  <dig> tfs detected by network screening in terms of coverage showed no overlapped tfs by the path consistency algorithm by two criteria. this difference might reflect the restriction of the known tf-gene relationships in network screening.

as a result, we merged the mr candidates identified by the two methods, and  <dig> tfs were finally identified as the candidates of mrs for diabetes progression in gk rats. note that sp <dig> emerged in both the  <dig> tfs and  <dig> tfs. the  <dig> final mr candidates with their regulated genes, in total  <dig> genes, are listed in table  <dig> 

the genes in bold characters are included in known tf-gene relationships detected by network screening.

discussion
in this study, we have identified the candidates of master regulators based on our previous study  <cit> , by using an improved method for their identification  <cit> . the mr candidates were extracted from the active networks of many genes characterized by biological pathways, as the feasible gene candidates for experimental verification. from the methodological aspect, the method was improved by considering the coverage of tfs in a statistical manner, in addition to the specificity that was considered in the previous method. although the experiments are beyond the scope of the present study, we consider experimental verification studies of the present candidates as our future research topic. our study clearly illustrated a rational way to narrow down the genes of mr candidates, and is fundamentally different from metaphysical presentations, such as biological pathways or large network forms.

our study intended to identify the mr candidates, which are those genes with large impacts on phenotype changes, in a biological sense  <cit> . here, we logically identified mr candidates by the specificity of the tf appearance and the coverage of the regulated genes to the gene expression signature in the networks of gk and wky rats. apart from a biological sense, we further investigated the meaning of "master" from the viewpoint of the network structure. to do this, we revealed the hierarchical structures of the 8w-12w and 16w-20w networks by network screening, using a vertex sort algorithm  <cit> , and allocated the present  <dig> tfs into the hierarchical structures . as seen in the figures, all  <dig> tfs were allocated into the highest level. indeed, nr2f <dig> in the 8w-12w network and tcfap2b in the 16w-20w network were definitely allocated into the highest level of the hierarchical structures. in addition, the remaining tfs were allocated into the levels including the highest and middle levels, but not into the lowest level. furthermore, we investigated the hierarchical structure by another method, the bfs-level algorithm  <cit> . as shown in figure 2b, the positions of the mr candidates are similar to those in figure 2a. indeed, previous hierarchical analyses of the regulatory networks by the bsf method in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested that the mrs were in the middle of the hierarchy  <cit> . in general, the vertex sort algorithm reports a linear ordering of nodes that contains all feasible solutions, while the bsf-level algorithm reports just a single solution, as shown in figures 2a and 2b. subsequently, unlike the bfs-level algorithm, the ordering in the vertex sort algorithm permits nodes to span an entire interval of possible positions with any feasible ordering. despite this difference in the computational algorithms, the  <dig> tfs showed the common property as mrs. at any rate, although the verification experiments remain to be performed for the justification of the mrs in a biological sense, the  <dig> tfs may be regarded as the plausible mr candidates from the viewpoint of network structure.

a preliminary survey revealed that all  <dig> of the tfs have no reported causal relationship to diabetes. the  <dig> tfs are sequence-specific dna-binding proteins, and they function as both transcriptional activators and repressors of large numbers of genes that are closely related to the cell cycle and tumorigenesis. notably, the relationships of ets translocation variant  <dig>  and transcription factor ap- <dig> beta  to adipogenesis, which is strongly related to diabetes, have been reported, together with their association with the other pathways  <cit> . nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group f, member  <dig>  is a member of the steroid hormone receptor family, and has been shown to interact with estrogen receptor alpha   <cit> . there is a gender difference in the incidence of type  <dig> diabetes, which is largely due to the role of the sex hormone estrogen. the sp family proteins, containing the conserved dna-binding domain, are localized primarily within subnuclear foci associated with the nuclear matrix. recent unpublished data from our lab have shown that another sp family member, sp <dig>  has a major impact on the insulin signaling pathway. the sp <dig> transcription factor interacts with e2f <dig>  which mediates both cell proliferation and p53-dependent/independent apoptosis  <cit> . the recently discovered close relationships between diabetes and tumors in terms of these tfs are quite likely to play a crucial role in the control of diabetes. rna-binding protein  is able to bind dna, rna and protein  <cit> . the interactions between the fus recognition sites and tcfap <dig>  gcf, and sp <dig> were identified recently. thus, although direct evidence was not found in the previous knowledge, the  <dig> tfs are expected to be mr candidates, in consideration of the circumstantial evidence of their relationships to diseases, the hierarchical analysis of the  <dig> tfs, and the successful discovery of new mrs in brain tumor, by the previous version of the procedure. actually, our current information in terms of important diabetes-related genes includes mostly functional proteins, located at the lowest level of our hierarchical structure, while the mr is deeply hidden and therefore must be revealed by systems biology methods. thus, in addition to analyses of their regulated genes, some experimental verification of the mr candidates may be desirable to further examine their plausibility as mr candidates for diabetes progression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, using our new method, we identified the mr candidates for diabetes progression,  <dig> tfs and their regulated genes, in gk rats. this number of candidates is very small, and thus the results can be used as a basis for biological experiments for verification. furthermore, the recent availability of the next-gen sequencer may provide another way to confirm the effectiveness of our method, and to test its performance further with other datasets. indeed, rna-seq and chip-seq are useful for more accurate measurements of gene expression, and yield detailed information about the regulated genes. thus, the combined use of the two approaches may compensate for the pitfalls inherent in each method, and will provide important clues about the transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiological or pathological cellular states.
