BACKGROUND
tissue plasminogen activator  is currently the only approved medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke. its use is limited to the first 3- <dig>  hours after stroke onset due to an increased risk of complications beyond this time window such symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation   <cit> . factors predisposing to tpa related ht remain to be fully defined, though several features are associated with increase ht risk including time from stroke onset, hypo-attenuation on pretreatment ct, leukoaraiosis, nihss on admission, diabetes, high systolic blood pressure, age, and thrombocytopenia  <cit> . tpa acts by cleaving plasminogen into the active enzyme plasmin, which degrades fibrin-based clots. the half-life of tpa's proteolytic activity on plasminogen is 3- <dig> minutes. in addition to tpa's fibrinolytic activity, a number of non-fibrinolytic properties have been described for tpa, some of which predispose to ht, blood brain barrier  disruption, and neuronal injury  <cit> . in this study, we sought to better define tpa's effects in acute ischemic stroke, determine if there is a blood gene expression profile that correlates with tpa administration, and determine if this blood gene expression profile differs from the profile associated with ischemic stroke.

gene expression profiles are a useful tool to study complex diseases, including ischemic stroke, as shown in previous studies of blood gene expression in humans and animals  <cit> . the rationale for gene expression changes in the blood following ischemic stroke is largely based on the immune response to ischemic brain that is distinct from other neurological conditions  <cit> . gene expression is also affected by medications, as observed with aspirin in ischemic stroke and corticosteroids in duchenne muscular dystrophy  <cit> .

using a rat model of ischemic stroke, we performed gene expression analysis on whole blood samples to determine the expression profile for tpa. a difference in gene expression was observed between rats receiving tpa compared to rats not receiving tpa. some genes expressed following administration of tpa interacted with ischemic stroke, with a different gene expression profile for tpa in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion  followed by reperfusion compared to rats with permanent-mcao. despite the interaction between tpa and ischemic stroke, the majority of the genes regulated by tpa can be distinguished from genes regulated by ischemic stroke.

RESULTS
there were no significant differences in physiologic parameters between animals receiving tpa compared to those not receiving tpa . the median neurological deficit score was  <dig> for both reperfused-mcao groups, with no significant difference between rats treated with or without tpa . the median neurological deficit score was  <dig> for both permanent-mcao groups, with no significant different between rats treated with or without tpa .

analysis  <dig>  tpa and ischemic stroke
gene expression associated with tpa administration was examined in an anova model including tpa, ischemic stroke, anesthesia, and the interaction between tpa and ischemic stroke. tpa, ischemic stroke, and the interaction between tpa and ischemic stroke were found to affect gene expression.

tpa gene expression
there were  <dig> gene probes differentially regulated by tpa  . of these  <dig> gene probes,  <dig> were up regulated  and  <dig> were down regulated . functional analysis was performed using ipa. the  <dig> gene probes mapped to  <dig> annotated genes and generated a total of  <dig> network eligible genes. among the top functions were cell signaling, cellular assembly and organization, inflammatory response, and cell death. genes of interest include mmp <dig> , tlr <dig> , il1r <dig>  and camk <dig>  .

discussion
tpa administration was associated with differential expression of  <dig> gene probes in the blood of rats with ischemic stroke. the genes expressed by tpa differed depending on whether or not ischemic stroke was accompanied by reperfusion. most genes had functions related to modulation of immune cells. this data is important as it has potential implications for tpa treatment of ischemic stroke and understanding the pharmacogenomics of tpa.

tpa and the immune system
tpa modulated gene expression related to the immune system. this is not unexpected, given that immune cells are intimately involved in tpa related complications of bbb breakdown and ht of ischemic brain tissue  <cit> . moreover, tpa has previously been reported to act on a number of immune cells, including mast cells and neutrophils.

mast cells play various roles in ischemic stroke, including altering bbb permeability, hemorrhage formation, brain edema formation, and regulation of local neutrophil infiltration  <cit> . tpa promotes mast cell degranulation, thus enhancing release of vasoactive, proteolytic, and fibrinolytic substances. mast cell stabilization with cromoglycate reduces tpa related brain hemorrhage, brain edema and neutrophil infiltration  <cit> . in our study, we identified a number of genes differentially regulated by tpa that affect mast cells, including those involved in mast cell activation  and mast cell degranulation .

neutrophils are recruited and activated early on following ischemic stroke. tpa has been shown to promote neutrophil degranulation  <cit> . upon degranulation, neutrophils release preformed granules containing proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> , that facilitate migration of leukocytes across the bbb to ischemic brain tissue  <cit> . the mechanisms by which tpa acts on neutrophils to mediate these effects are unknown. however, products of tpa clot degradation may contribute in part to neutrophil activation and infiltration  <cit> . a number of the identified tpa regulated genes in our study are associated with neutrophils. in the reperfused-mcao group, tpa was associated with genes involved in neutrophil activation  and neutrophil migration . in the permanent-mcao group, genes involved in neutrophil attachment to endothelium  and genes involved in neutrophil recruitment  was observed. further study is required to delineate the effects of tpa on immune response in ischemic stroke, including determination of the specific immune cells and pathways affected by tpa. these potentially identify new targets to reduce tpa related complications in ischemic stroke and perhaps extend the therapeutic window of tpa.

tpa and immune-endothelial effects
endothelial cells form an integral part of the bbb along with the basal lamina and astrocytic foot processes. tpa can affect endothelial cells in both a direct and indirect manner. indirectly tpa modulates immune cells that interact with endothelium. tpa increases endothelial adhesion molecule expression including icam <dig>  p-selectin, and e-selectin  <cit> . direct effects of tpa on endothelial cells is mediated via the lipoprotein receptor protein- <dig> . binding of tpa to lrp- <dig> initiates a signal cascade that up regulates endothelial mmp- <dig> and disrupts the bbb  <cit> .

our study identified a number of differentially regulated genes involved in immune-endothelial signaling pathways, including genes involved in inflammatory cell adhesion, migration, and recruitment. in the reperfused-mcao group, genes involved in immune-endothelial interaction include icam <dig>  ceacam <dig>  id <dig>  and actn <dig>  notably, genes involved in immune-endothelial signaling were not as significantly affected by tpa in the permanent-mcao group. this suggests that further study of genes involved in immune-endothelial interaction may provide insight into the increased risk of tpa related ht in subjects with reperfusion compared to permanent occlusion.

tpa and mmp-9
mmp- <dig> has been studied in ischemic stroke at both the protein and rna level in blood and brain. mmp- <dig> is a protease that degrades extracellular matrix and promotes bbb breakdown. protein levels of mmp- <dig> increase in the blood early on after ischemic stroke onset, and this increase is enhanced by tpa  <cit> . in rats treated with tpa, the rise in blood mmp- <dig> peaks by  <dig> hours and return to baseline by  <dig> hours  <cit> . in human stroke patients treated with tpa, a similar rise blood mmp- <dig> occurs by  <dig> hours and with a return to baseline by  <dig> hours  <cit> . mmp- <dig> mrna expression in the blood following tpa treated ischemic stroke remains poorly studied. we found mmp- <dig> mrna to be reduced at  <dig> hours. this is consistent with an early rise of mmp- <dig> levels in the blood by 6- <dig> hours, followed by a reduction by  <dig> hours. this is in contrast to the pattern of mmp- <dig> expression in the brain, where levels remain elevated at the 24- <dig> hour time point  <cit> . further study is required to better delineate mmp- <dig> mrna expression patterns in blood, including the relationship with vascular reperfusion, duration of cerebral ischemia, treatment with tpa, and correlation with expression patterns of mmp- <dig> in cerebral tissue.

tpa and cerebral reperfusion
the genes regulated by tpa in the blood were different depending on the status of vascular reperfusion. rats reperfused after two hours of cerebral ischemia had a different tpa gene expression profile than rats with permanent-mcao. reperfusion of ischemic vasculature and cerebral tissue leads to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion  injury. this injury includes glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and necrotic or apoptotic cell death  <cit> . our study suggests that tpa modulates ir injury beyond the effects mediated by reperfusion alone. this modulation includes alteration of immune cells and immune-endothelial interaction. i/r injury is a complex process and its impact on clinical outcome in ischemic stroke is dependent on numerous factors including intensity and duration of ischemic insult, time to reperfusion, and the microcirculation  <cit> . further study of tpa's effects on reperfusion may aid in identifying targets to reduce the contribution of tpa to i/r injury.

tpa and ischemic stroke
blood gene expression profiling is a promising approach for diagnosing and understanding the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke  <cit> . in this study of rat ischemic stroke we were able to identify a gene expression profile associated with rat ischemic stroke. some of the ischemic stroke genes were also regulated by tpa, indicating an interaction between ischemic stroke and tpa. however, many genes associated with ischemic stroke are not affected by tpa including bcl <dig>  f <dig>  and ly <dig> which were previously found to be predictive of ischemic stroke in humans  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes previously identified in humans to be differentially regulated by ischemic stroke, only  <dig> overlapped with the  <dig> tpa genes we identified in this study of rats  <cit> . this suggests that although tpa affects the gene expression profile in whole blood and should be considered when evaluating gene expression profiles in acute ischemic stroke, it is possible to distinguish tpa effects from the effects of ischemic stroke on gene expression. a gene expression profile can also be used to identify exposure to drug treatment. we were able to correctly predict tpa use in  <dig> out  <dig> rats with  <dig> gene probes in the reperfused-mcao group and  <dig> gene probes in the permanent-mcao group.

a strength of our study is the measurement of all known genes in the blood to determine those altered by tpa in ischemic stroke. a limitation is the analysis of blood gene expression only. tpa is known to mediate effects on endothelium and brain, thus further study is required to correlate changes in the blood with changes in these tissues. additionally, we were only able to investigate a single dosage of tpa at a single time point. the equivalent dose for non-fibrinolytic effects of tpa in rats compared to humans remains unknown, therefore results need to be interpreted with this in mind. finally, anesthesia was used in the experimental model. although accounted for in the anova model, anesthesia may still have had some effect on gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
a gene expression profile for tpa was identified in our rat model of ischemic stroke. the changes of gene expression by tpa reflect modulation of the immune cells. the patterns of gene expression by tpa were dependent on the status of cerebrovascular reperfusion. the majority of genes modulated by tpa in blood are distinct from those modulated by ischemic stroke. this suggests that in the blood of humans it should be possible to monitor gene expression profiles that correspond both to ischemic stroke and to the pharmacological effects of tpa.
