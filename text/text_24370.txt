BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to be a major etiologic agent of destructive adult periodontitis, with a significant lifestyle component harbored within the complex multi-species biofilm  that develops along the gingival margins  <cit> . the bacterium expresses a number of potential virulence factors, such as long  and short  fimbriae, lipopolysaccharides , and proteases  <cit> . among these factors, a unique class of cysteine proteinases, termed gingipains, composed of arginine-specific  and lysine-specific  proteases, are implicated in a wide range of both pathological and physiological processes  <cit> . proteases can be post-translationally processed for retention on the cell surface or secretion into the extracellular milieu. rgp enzymes are glycosylated, with their carbohydrate domain containing phosphorylated branched mannans that can contribute to the anchoring of rgp on bacterial outer membrane  <cit> . in addition, this phosphorylated branched mannan constitutes an exopolysaccharide that is distinguishable from both lps and the serotypeable capsule polysaccharides of p. gingivalis  <cit> .

the cell-associated gingipains comprise the majority  of rgp and kgp activities, and are reported to be definitive virulence factors that degrade various host proteins, leading to impaired cellular integrity and function  <cit> . in addition, gingipains can mediate bacterial interactions with host components  <cit> . recent findings indicate that gingipains are also involved in biofilm development. polyphenolic inhibitors of gingipains can prevent not only homotypic  biofilm formation by p. gingivalis  <cit> , but also synergistic biofilm formation with fusobacterium nucleatum  <cit> . in addition, an rgpb-deficient mutant of p. gingivalis lost the ability to form synergistic biofilms with treponema denticola  <cit> . a low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase, ltp <dig>  was found to be involved in biofilm formation via suppression of exopolysaccharide production and luxs expression, as well as dephosphorylation of gingipains  <cit> . thus, gingipains and gingipain regulation may be related to exopolysaccharide accumulation. however, the exact role of gingipains in biofilm development remains to be elucidated.

two distinct fimbria types, long and short fimbriae, are present on the surface of p. gingivalis cells  <cit> . long fimbriae impact the host immune response by inducing human peripheral macrophages and neutrophils to overproduce several proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- <dig> , il- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor alpha, through coordinated interactions with pattern-recognition receptors  <cit> . long fimbriae were also reported to induce cross-talk between cxc chemokine receptor  <dig> and toll-like receptor  <dig> in human monocytes and thus undermine host defense  <cit> . furthermore, long fimbriae are prominent adhesins that mediate colonization in periodontal tissues and invasion of host cells as well as dysregulation of host cell cycle, which assists p. gingivalis in its persistence in periodontal tissues  <cit> . while, the role of short fimbriae in virulence is less well understood, they are necessary for the development of synergistic biofilms between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii via a specific interaction with the streptococcal sspb protein  <cit> . recently, these two distinct types of fimbriae were reported to function cooperatively in the development of homotypic biofilms of p. gingivalis  <cit> . it was proposed that the long fimbriae were responsible for bacterial attachment to the substrate as well as initiation of colonization, whereas short fimbriae were involved in the formation of microcolonies and biofilm maturation. in that study, it was also shown that short fimbriae promoted bacterial autoaggregation, which was suppressed by the long fimbriae. in contrast, another study showed opposite results, as deletion of short fimbriae enhanced autoaggregation and negligible autoaggregation occurred in the long fimbria mutants tested  <cit> . thus, the contextual roles of these fimbria types in biofilm development are unclear, and further study is necessary.

in the present study, we examined the roles of long and short fimbriae as well as arg-and lys-gingipains in homotypic biofilm formation by p. gingivalis using a series of deletion mutants of strain atcc <dig> 

RESULTS
microstructure of biofilms under nonproliferation condition
first, we evaluated the roles of long/short fimbriae and gingipains in initial attachment and organization of biofilms which is a crucial event in the early phase of biofilm formation  <cit> . when cultured in tsb as free-living cells, wild type and all mutant strains showed the similar growth rates, as reported in previous study  <cit> . in contrast, when incubated in pbs for  <dig> h, wild type and mutants lacking long and/or short fimbriae formed distinct biofilms . wild type strain  <dig> formed biofilms with a dense basal monolayer and dispersed microcolonies. compared with the wild type, the long fimbria mutant kdp <dig> formed patchy and sparser biofilms with a significantly greater distance between fewer peaks, although mean peak height was almost the same as that of the wild type strain. in contrast, the short fimbria mutant mpg <dig> developed cluster and channel-like biofilms consisting of significantly taller microcolonies compared to the wild type. similar to mpg <dig>  the mutant  lacking both types of fimbriae also formed thick biofilms with significantly taller microcolonies than the wild type. viability of the cells in biofilms of each strain was tested by colony count and confirmed at  <dig> h . these results suggest that the long fimbriae are involved in initial attachment and organization of biofilms by p. gingivalis, whereas the short fimbriae have a suppressive regulatory role for these steps.

the involvement of gingipains in biofilm formation was evaluated using a set of p. gingivalis mutants lacking kgp , rgpa/b , or both kgp and rgpa/b . these mutants lacked the proteolytic domains as well as the adhesion domains of gingipains  <cit> . in addition, both rgp mutants  lacked bacterial cell-surface structural components such as long and short fimbriae and hemagglutinins which are processed by rgp  <cit> . the kgp mutant kdp <dig> formed markedly thick biofilms containing large accumulations of which the mean height was significantly taller than the wild type . in addition, the efficiency of autoaggregation in kdp <dig> was significantly increased . these results suggest that kgp plays a negative role in biofilm development via suppressing autoaggregation and/or regulating dispersion, de-concentration, and/or detachment of microcolonies. the rgpa/b mutant kdp <dig> formed channel-like biofilms with fibrillar microcolonies , which featured significantly fewer peaks and longer distances between peaks, but increased height, as compared to those of the wild type and kgp mutant . although the features of kdp <dig> were likely attributable to the loss of multiple factors on the bacterial surface, rgp itself might be a bifunctional mediator promoting peak formation and shearing the fibrillar microcolonies of biofilms. interestingly, the biofilms formed by the gingipain null mutant  showed different features from both the kgp  and rgp  mutants. although the three mutants, kdp <dig>  kdp <dig> and mpg <dig>  resemble each other in terms of lack of expression of both types of fimbriae, their microstructures were divergent . these findings suggested that biofilm formation was affected not only by the post-translational regulation of the expression of cell surface components by rgp, but also by uncharacterized steps that were not altered by rgp. loss of all gingipain activities might result in downstream events which did not happen in kdp <dig> and kdp <dig>

quantitative analysis of biofilms in pbs
the biovolume of the biofilms was also altered by deletion of various bacterial factors . the deletion of long fimbriae significantly reduced the biovolume, whereas the mutant without short fimbriae developed extensive biofilms. the deletion of kgp also increased the biovolume, whereas no significant change was observed in the rgp mutants. these results support the above suggested roles; i.e., long fimbriae are a facilitator, short fimbriae and kpg are suppressors, whereas rgp has dual functions, promoting peak formation and shearing the fibrillar microcolonies, in the initial phase of biofilm formation by p. gingivalis.

microstructure under proliferation condition
next, the roles of the fimbriae and gingipains were examined in the early maturation phase of biofilms, which is associated with an increase in biovolume mainly due to cell division and exopolysaccharide accumulation. biofilm development was induced by culture in nutrient medium. figure  <dig> shows various features of biofilms of the mutants incubated in dtsb for  <dig> hours. the wild type strain formed biofilms with a dense basal monolayer with dispersed microcolonies, similar to the pbs condition, but with more and taller peaks . the long fimbria mutant kdp <dig> formed biofilms with a thicker monolayer and with a greater number of the fine, taller peaks compared to wild type, . those features suggested that long fimbriae have a role in suppression of the development of an thickened basal layer, but trigger protruding peak formation in early maturation phase. the short fimbria mutant mpg <dig> formed significantly clustered biofilms consisted of tall and wide microcolonies, suggesting that short fimbriae negatively control the morphology of microcolonies, as mentioned above. the mutant lacking both types of fimbriae  also formed markedly thick and dense biofilms containing various size of microcolonies, suggesting that both types of fimbriae negatively regulate biofilm formation in early maturation phase. the kgp mutant kdp <dig> formed large microcolonies which were well dispersed, whereas the rgp mutant kdp <dig> made the most thick biofilms with the tallest acicular microcolonies . these findings suggested that kgp suppresses microcolony expansion, whereas rgp mediates transverse enlargement and restrains the longitudinal extension. as with the result in pbs, biofilms with the gingipain null mutant kdp <dig> showed different features from both kdp <dig> and kdp <dig>

quantitative analysis of biofilms in dtsb
in the early maturation phase, the biovolumes of the biofilms were significantly increased in all of tested mutants as compared to the wild type . deletion of long fimbriae resulted in the opposite tendency from the initial attachment phase, suggesting that this molecule has distinct roles under the different phases.

exopolysaccharide production under proliferation conditions
as extracellular polysaccharide is important for the development of biofilm communities, we examined the influences of fimbriae and gingipains on the accumulation of exopolysaccharide in p. gingivalis biofilms. to visualize and quantify exopolysaccharide accumulation in biofilms under the proliferation condition, 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole -labeled p. gingivalis cells and fluorescein isothiocyanate -labeled exopolysaccharide were examined by confocal microscopy with digitally reconstructed image analysis. in all of the tested strains, dapi-labeled cells exhibited the same microstructures of biofilms composed of 5--carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester -labeled cells, as shown in figure  <dig>  thus validating the use of these live-staining methods . exopolysaccharide visualization enabled us to assess the accumulation pattern  and exopolysaccharide biovolume per base area . furthermore, the exopolysaccharide production was normalized to the levels of dapi-labeled p. gingivalis cells in the biofilms and expressed as the exopolysaccharide/cell ratio . interestingly, a unique pattern of exopolysaccharide accumulation was observed in the rgp mutant kdp <dig> in vertical sections  of biofilms . in contrast to the other strains, exopolysaccharide accumulated in the middle layer, and the biofilm surface was not covered with exopolysaccharide. it was also notable that the long fimbria mutant kdp <dig> developed a biofilm enriched with exopolysaccharide , reflecting a significantly higher exopolysaccharide/cell ratio . the gingipain null mutant kdp <dig> produced the most abundant exopolysaccharide per unit base area . the minor fimbria mutant mpg <dig>  long/short fimbriae mutant mpg <dig> and rgp mutant kdp <dig> also accumulated significantly larger amounts of exopolysaccharide than wild type; however, exopolysaccharide/cell ratio in kdp <dig> and mpg <dig> was significantly lower than wild type because biofilms of these strains consisted of larger numbers of cells .

autoaggregation
bacterial autoaggregation has been reported to play an important role in initial biofilm formation  <cit> , thus the autoaggregation efficiencies of the mutants were assessed . deletion of long fimbriae significantly reduced the autoaggregation efficiency, which agreed with the previous report that long fimbriae were required for autoaggregation  <cit> . the efficiency of autoaggregation was significantly increased in the kgp mutant kdp <dig>  short fimbria mutant mpg <dig> and long/short fimbriae deficient mutant mpg <dig>  suggesting that kgp and short fimbriae act to suppress autoaggregation. contrary to our prediction, the gingipain null mutant kdp <dig> and rgp mutant kdp <dig> showed different tendencies of autoaggregation from mpg <dig>  although all of these strains were considered to be long/short fimbriae deficient mutants. thus, not only fimbrial expression but also other factors, modified by gingipains, seem to be involved in autoaggregation. in addition, it was found that autoaggregation and biofilm parameters such as biovolume, number of peaks and peak height were not significantly correlated in every strain . this result suggests that autoaggregation is not the sole determinant of alteration in structure of p. gingivalis biofilms.

tenacity of biofilms
to analyze the influence of the molecules under investigation on vulnerability of biofilms, the physical strength of the biofilms against brief ultrasonication was compared . consistent with the results of image analysis described in figure  <dig> and figure 5a, the long/short fimbriae mutant mpg <dig> and rgp mutant kdp <dig> formed expansive biofilms with large numbers of cells in dtsb, however, their strength was found to be very fragile compared to the other strains, suggesting that these biofilms consisted of loosely connected microcolonies. in contrast, the biofilms of the long fimbria mutant kdp <dig> were resistant to sonic disruption, suggesting that long fimbriae are initial mediator of biofilm formation but are not required to maintain resistance against environmental shear force.

collectively, these results suggest that long fimbriae are required for initial formation of biofilms by p. gingivalis, but suppress the development of an exopolysaccharide-enriched basal layer that is related to the adhesive property of biofilms. in contrast, short fimbriae and kgp may have suppressive and regulatory roles for biofilm formation, with control over morphology of microcolonies, whereas rgp mediates microcolony formation and restrains the biovolume. in addition, other factors beside fimbriae and gingipains are likely involved in homotypic biofilm formation by p. gingivalis.

discussion
dental plaque, a precursor for periodontal disease, is also a well studied model of bacterial biofilms in general  <cit> . developing biofilm communities in the oral cavity are fundamental for the persistence of organisms such as p. gingivalis and continual exposure of the host to p. gingivalis can result in a dysfunctional immune response  <cit> . biofilm maturation proceeds through a series of developmental steps involving the attachment of cells to, and growth on, a surface, followed by detachment and dissemination to a new site to start the cycle again  <cit> . it is likely that much of biofilm-specific physiology is devoted to dynamic changes that both stimulate an increase in biovolume and limit or stabilize accumulation according to environmental constraints. therefore, multiple bacterial factors are thought to be required to regulate appropriate biofilm structure.

in the present study, the roles of long/short fimbriae and gingipains on the initiation and development of biofilms formed by p. gingivalis were examined. interestingly, those molecules were found to play distinct roles in the above-mentioned dynamic changes that stimulate, limit or stabilize the biofilm formation. long fimbriae were shown to be initial positive mediators of biofilm formation, however, these appendages also functioned to decrease the adhesive property of biofilms via repressing exopolysaccharide accumulation in basal layer. in addition, short fimbriae as well as kgp were found to be negative regulators of microcolony formation and of biovolume. rgp seems to play a bifunctional role in coordinating the integrity of the biofilm through mediating microcolony formation and restraining the biovolume. our results indicate that all of these interactions are likely to be coordinately essential for the initiation and development of appropriately structured biofilms. to our knowledge, this is the first report to evaluate the roles of long/short fimbriae as well as gingipains on p. gingivalis biofilm formation.

interestingly, the distinct fimbria types functioned differently in regard to biofilm formation. our findings agree with a recent report  <cit> , which suggested that long fimbriae are required for initial attachment and organization of biofilms. in that study, it was also shown that short fimbriae promoted bacterial autoaggregation, whereas long fimbriae suppressed it. other studies have shown that autoaggregation is attributable to long fimbriae on the cell surface  <cit> , and deletion of short fimbriae enhances autoaggregation  <cit> , more consistent with our present findings. however, it would appear that autoaggregation is context and assay dependent, and in any event not a good predictor of accumulation on abiotic surfaces.

recently, it was reported that clpxp, a proteolytic core and associated atpase unit of the bacterial stress response system, negatively regulated the surface exposure of short fimbriae, and a clpxp mutant showed elevated monospecies biofilm formation  <cit> . as we have shown here that the short fimbria mutant mpg <dig> developed greater biofilm accumulation than the wild type, it is likely that clpxp has numerous effects on cell surface molecules important in biofilm development.

the long/short fimbriae mutant mpg <dig> and rgpa/b mutant kdp <dig> developed biofilms with significantly large amounts of bacterial cells. in addition, the exopolysaccharide/cell ratio was significantly smaller than the other strains, and the biofilms of these strains were shown to be fragile . rgp is an enzyme that processes precursor proteins of bacterial surface components such as fimbriae  <cit> , therefore, rgp-null mutants exhibit defective surface protein presentation. thus not only mpg <dig> but also kdp <dig> do not have intact fimbrial protein on the cell surface, which might be related to imperfect anchoring of exopolysaccharide on the bacterial surfaces. the gingipains null mutant kdp <dig> did not show the same tendency in spite of the lack of both types of fimbriae, suggesting the presence of kgp was related to the unusual exopolysaccharide accumulation. in contrast, long fimbriae mutant kdp <dig> formed a tough and cohesive biofilm, and its exopolysaccharide/cell ratio was significantly higher than the other strains. together, these findings suggest that the exopolysaccharide/cell ratio seems to be related to the physical strength of p. gingivalis biofilms.

the specific role of kgp may involve regulation of biofilm formation by the dispersion, de-concentration, and/or detachment of microcolonies. rgp also seemed to coordinate the integrity of the biofilm in the developing phase as well as maturation phase. there are several reports which suggest that the present morphological changes in proteinase mutants were possibly due to loss of proteolytic activities. in staphylococcus aureus, increased levels of serine proteases were detected in detaching biofilm effluents, and a serine protease inhibitor suppressed the biofilm detachment  <cit> . in the same report, a double mutant in a metalloprotease and serine proteases, which displayed minimal extracellular protease activity, showed significantly enhanced biofilm formation and a strongly attenuated detachment phenotype. in streptococcus pneumoniae, trypsin or proteinase k was shown to inhibit biofilm development, and incubation of mature biofilms with proteinase k drastically diminished the number of biofilm-associated sessile cells  <cit> . since our data also showed that the mutation in gingipain genes resulted in enhanced biofilm formation as well as a strongly attenuated detachment phenotype, this suggests that proteinase domains of kgp and rgp are significantly involved in biofilm regulation  <cit> . in addition, the tyrosine phosphatase ltp <dig> reportedly dephosphorylated gingipains, resulting in suppression of biofilm formation  <cit> , which also supports the involvement of gingipains as shown in this study. furthermore, the present gingipain mutants lacked proteinase domains as well as c-terminal flanking segments coding for hemaglutinin/adhesin  domains  <cit> . higher concentrations of iron in the cultivation media can have a positive effect on the stability of the biofilms  <cit> , thus decreased hemin uptake due to the lack of ha domains might modulate the biofilm structures in dtsb.

autoaggregation driven by nonspecific hydrophobic mechanisms is thought to contribute to hetero- and homo-typic biofilm formation  <cit> . indeed, the significant change of autoaggregation efficiencies in kdp <dig>  kdp <dig>  mpg <dig> and mpg <dig> were found to be positively associated with alteration of biofilm structures under the non-proliferation condition. however, such an association was not observed in rgp-null mutant strains, kdp <dig> and kdp <dig>  and was not significant under the proliferation condition. our present results suggested that a biofilm-regulatory molecule rgp does not function through autoaggregation but rather through other mechanisms mediating intimate contact among p. gingivalis cells. recently kato et al. found that autoaggregation ability correlated poorly with the hydrophobicity in fima-substituted mutants  <cit> . in addition, the hydrophobicity was reported not to depend on the presence or absence of fima on the bacterial surface  <cit> . in-depth mathematical and physical examinations may be needed to explain the complicated roles of hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and cell surface structure on biofilm development.

besides fimbria and proteinases, our findings indicate that other molecules of p. gingivalis, which are not processed by gingipains, mediate homotypic biofilm formation. indeed several factors, including a putative glycosyltransferase , udp-galactose 4-epimerase , internalin j protein , a universal stress protein , and a low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase , have been reported to be required for homotypic biofilm formation by p. gingivalis  <cit> . autoinducer- <dig>  which regulates proteinase and hemagglutinin activities, hemin and iron acquisition pathways, and stress gene expression, is also considered to be involved in homotypic biofilm formation  <cit> . it is possible that these molecules also have effects in regard to biofilm structure alterations, in addition to fimbriae and gingipains. further work is necessary to understand the complete process of the biofilm formation by p. gingivalis.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results suggest distinct roles of long/short fimbriae and gingipains in homotypic biofilm development by p. gingivalis. long fimbriae are initial positive mediators of biofilm formation, and thereafter they decrease the expression of exopolysaccharide to regulate adhesive properties. short fimbriae as well as kgp are negative regulators of microcolony formation. rgp plays a bifunctional role to coordinate the integrity of the biofilm through mediating microcolony formation and restraining biovolume. collectively, these molecules seem to act coordinately to regulate the development of mature biofilms.
