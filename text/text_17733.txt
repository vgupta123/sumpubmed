BACKGROUND
abdominal ultrasound is routinely performed in animals with suspected renal disease or when increased creatinine and/or urea serum levels are detected. while disorders causing focal abnormalities such as renal cysts, nephroliths, dystrophic mineralizations, renal infarcts and solid masses are easily identified by means of b-mode ultrasound  <cit> , architectural modifications associated with diffused parenchymal renal diseases are more difficult to assess using ultrasound. the distinction between normal kidneys and kidneys with acute or chronic damage by means of b-mode ultrasound images is currently based on subjective criteria   <cit> .

cortical echogenicity is usually assessed in comparison to liver or spleen echogenicity. since the right kidney is recessed within the renal fossa of the caudate hepatic lobe, these two structures could be compared simultaneously; similar observations may be applied for the relationship between the spleen and left kidney  <cit> .

increased cortical or cortical and medullary echogenicity is reported to be one of the most common signs of chronic or acute kidney disease in veterinary medicine  <cit> . in human medicine, a high correlation between cortical echogenicity and glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and interstitial inflammation has been described  <cit> .

qualitative evaluation of the echogenicity of the renal cortex in human patients is reported to be subject to high inter- and intra-observer variation and is thus considered unreliable  <cit> . nevertheless, the results of a comparative study between renal cortex and liver echogenicity documented a substantial agreement between qualitative and quantitative observations in healthy dogs  <cit> .

different factors are reported to bias the operator-based analysis of the parenchymal echogenity: 1) a multi-focal disease simultaneously affecting more than one parenchymal organ; 2) the degree of fat deposition  that progressively increases parenchymal echogenicity; 3) the objective limited human capability to assess the actual echogenicity, as the human eye can only detect  <dig> to  <dig> shades of gray  <cit> .

to overcome the above described limitations, several papers discussing the use of computer-assisted image analysis software  to objectively assess the echogenicity of parenchymal organs have been published in human medicine  <cit> . by contrast, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, only a few papers describing the quantitative evaluation of renal echogenicity in healthy cats and dogs are available in the literature  <cit> , whereas no studies investigating the actual relationship between renal echogenicity and the degree of inflammatory or degenerative histological changes in the same pet species can be found.

it is the authors’ belief that at least  <dig> reasons for the scarce development of ultrasound quantitative analysis techniques in canine and feline medicine could be identified as: 1) the challenging standardization of an ultrasound-based analytical methodology in the variably-sized pet-animal patient; 2) the lack of literature regarding the correlation between caias data and the status of the scanned parenchyma as determined by histopathology.

the rationale behind this funded research project  was to investigate the feasibility and usefulness of quantitative ultrasound analysis in the veterinary medical imaging field and, as part of this project, the purpose of this work was to investigate, under standardized operative conditions, the influence of different histological lesions on the echogenicity of images deriving from scans of ex-vivo kidneys evaluated by means of mgv.

methods
specimens
the cadavers of  <dig> adult dogs  and  <dig> adult cats  that died or were euthanized due to humanitarian reasons at the veterinary teaching hospital, university of padua, italy, were the study population. written consent was obtained from the owners. patient history, including blood and urine analysis, was collected if available.

each cadaver underwent a complete necropsy to determine the cause of death; all necropsies were performed within 24 hours of death. right and left kidney tissue samples were collected from each cadaver. the kidney tissue samples consisted of half of the kidney dissected longitudinally.

ultrasonographic procedures
in order to standardize ultrasonographic procedures, each tissue sample was placed in an individual plastic bag containing 200 cc of tap water. the samples were scanned with a 6- to 10-mhz linear array transducer connected to a commercial sonographic scanner . the following ultrasonographic settings were maintained constant throughout the scans: depth 4 cm, frequency 10 mhz, gain 50; time-gain-compensation control settings were maintained in a neutral position. the samples were imaged longitudinally  and both cortex and medulla were included in the scans.

image analysis procedures
images were stored in a digital imaging and communications in medicine format  without compression. mgv was calculated by means of an open-source caias  in a manually selected polygonal region of interest . in each specimen the roi was selected in a way to include only the renal cortex. focal abnormalities of the renal cortex, such as mineralizations and cysts, were not included in the roi. mgv represents the average gray value within the selected areas. in 8-bit images the gray values range from  <dig> to  <dig> . this binary representation assumes that  <dig> is black and  <dig> is white.

histological analysis
the tissue samples were removed from the water-filled plastic bags and fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin immediately after the ultrasonographic procedures. for histopathology, renal tissue was processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin. serial 3-mm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-schiff, masson’s trichrome, acid fuchsine orange-g, and periodic acid methenamine silver  <cit> . congo red staining was used to confirm the presence of amyloid.

a complete histological examination was performed on each sample and lesions were classified as follows: glomerulosclerosis, interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis, tubular atrophy, tubular necrosis, fibrosis, glomerular lipidosis, tubular vacuolar degeneration, amyloidosis. samples revealing no significant abnormalities were classified as “no relevant findings”. histologically confirmed tumors were excluded from the study. a modification of the grading system used in our previous work  <cit>  was applied and all the lesions were assessed through a semi-quantitative method on a scale ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .

statistical analysis
all the statistical analyses were performed through commercial statistical software . the analysis was performed separately for dogs and cats. to test the effect of histological abnormalities on mgv, grouping of samples was based on the histological findings, but due to the reduced number of some histological lesions a dichotomic variable  was preferred for statistical analysis. differences between samples grouped by histological lesions and samples classified as “no relevant findings” were calculated. for normally distributed data, differences between groups were calculated using analysis of variance . for non-normally distributed data, the kruskal-wallis h test was used to investigate differences between groups. the relative contribution to echogenicity of histological parameters was evaluated through univariate analysis.

to correlate the mgv, histological lesions were included within two groups: 1) degeneration ; and 2) inflammation . the semi-quantitative grades previously assessed were maintained for the statistical analysis. the spearman rank-order correlation test was used to study the correlation between mgv and both degeneration and inflammation. for normally distributed data, differences between groups were calculated using anova. for non-normally distributed data, the kruskal-wallis h test was used to investigate differences between groups. the tukey-kramer method was used for multiple comparison tests.

lastly, the differentiation efficiency of mgv for normal  or pathological samples was analyzed by means of the receiver operating characteristic curve .

the variable mgv  was tested for normality using graphic methods  and the shapiro-wilk test. during all statistical analyses, two-tailed p-values of less than  <dig>  were considered to indicate statistically significant difference.

RESULTS
dog

discussion
technical and patient-related factors potentially biasing quantitative ultrasonography are mainly linked to roi depth , to the amount and type of tissue overlying the roi , and to the ultrasonographic settings   <cit> .

previous studies aimed at an objective evaluation of renal echogenicity in dogs and cats were performed exclusively on healthy animals and the echogenicity was evaluated in a comparative manner .

to obtain reliable data without the need for a phantom and/or comparison to other parenchymal organs and, at the same time, to avoid patient and technical related biases, we analyzed ex-vivo kidneys under standardized experimental conditions. furthermore, we correlated the mgvs, as measured through caias, not only to normal but also to pathological kidneys, as diagnosed by histopathology. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report in veterinary medicine correlating sonographic findings with renal histopathology and thus with the severity of degenerative and inflammatory changes.

in dogs only glomerulosclerosis was an independent determinant of echogenicity. in cats, all the considered parameters were correlated with echogenicity but only interstitial nephritis, fibrosis and tubular necrosis were independent determinants of echogenicity. moreover, histological lesions accounted for 23% of total variability in the feline samples, while histological lesions explained only 12% of variability in dogs. the remaining 77% of variability in cats and 88% in dogs could be related to an individual variation effect or to the type of image analysis performed. an in-vivo study in human medicine quantitatively assessing the influence of pathological changes  on the echogenicity of the kidney reported that only 20% of the total variability was explained by the histological parameters  <cit> .

individual differences in the amount of fat vacuoles in the renal tubular epithelium are described to substantially affect the echogenicity of kidneys in healthy cats  <cit> . since the different amount of fat vacuoles is considered a para-physiological variation, it was not reported within histological results. it is very likely, however, that such individual variations might account for part of the variability in the univariate analysis unexplained by the histological parameters. on the contrary, there is not, to the best of our knowledge, enough information reported in the literature to justify the low influence of histological lesions on canine mgvs.

statistical analysis of the degenerative and inflammatory changes evaluated in our semi-quantitative histological score system also revealed different results in dogs and cats. in dogs, kidney echogenicity rapidly increases with mild degenerative changes but decreases and becomes similar to that of normal kidneys in the presence of more severe lesions . furthermore, inflammatory changes did not yield any significant variation in renal echogenicity. the mgvs for feline kidneys have a more linear correlation with the degeneration and inflammation histological scores than the canine samples.

it is reported that the clinical distinction between normal and chronically degenerated kidneys solely on the basis of echogenicity may be difficult and that other ultrasonographic characteristics  might be helpful  <cit> . in fact, as a result of the roc curve analysis of the dog samples, mgv is a poor test to distinguishing between normal and pathological kidneys with a high sensitivity but low specificity. in the cat, mgv seems to perform globally better, resulting as a fair test, despite the very high specificity and low sensitivity.

it is the authors’ opinion that the differences observed between dogs and cats may be related to different factors: 1) the relative low number of samples demonstrating the presence of one or more histological lesion ; 2) the different number of samples between dogs and cats; 3) the reported differences in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease in dogs and cats  <cit> , which may influence echogenicity differently. with reference to this latter point, no agreement has been reached to date regarding the variations in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease in dogs and cats, and different studies report different histological lesions to be correlated with disease severity  <cit> .

the present study was performed on ex-vivo samples and factors potentially biasing the analysis have been avoided; further in-vivo studies, possibly involving a larger number of subjects, are required to test whether the mgv analysis could be shifted to the clinical field.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report in veterinary medicine quantitatively assessing through a standardized procedure the influence of renal histopathology on the echogenicity of the kidneys. mean gray value or renal cortical echogenicity is mainly influenced by glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis in dogs and by interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis and fibrosis in cats. the global influence of histological lesions on renal echogenicity was higher in cats than in dogs. the mgv of the canine kidneys rapidly increases in relation to mild degenerative lesions but decreases as the severity of the lesions progresses. inflammatory lesions show no influence on echogenicity. the echogenicity of the feline kidneys increases linearly both with inflammatory and degenerative changes.
