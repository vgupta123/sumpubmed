BACKGROUND
exposure to heavy metal toxicity has become a major limiting factor in the growth and yield of crop plants, affecting the sustainability of agricultural production and hence threatening food security. heavy metal toxicity retards plant growth by marginalizing the cellular functions of proteins, lipids, and elemental components of thylakoid membranes. disturbances in the thylakoid membranes, organelles indispensable for photosynthetic activity, are often correlated with senescence processes
 <cit> . among heavy metals, cadmium  and copper  have been known to hinder the growth of crop plants, especially rice plants. rice paddies are contaminated by cd/cu in phosphate fertilizers, sludge, and irrigated water. cd absorbed and transported inside rice plants can create severe health problems because rice is consumed on a daily basis
 <cit> . cu bioaccumulation inside plant tissues tends to disturb the enzymatic activities required for chlorophyll biosynthesis
 <cit> . in addition, cd/cu influences leaf elongation, cell wall elasticity, potassium levels, and sugar accumulation
 <cit> .

cadmium  and copper  are taken together with other elements , through the transmembrane carrier from the root cortex to the stele
 <cit> . the uptake of heavy metals is influenced by metal-transporting transmembrane proteins, including heavy metal atpases , low-affinity cation transporters  and iron-regulated transporters 
 <cit> . these commonly known metal transport genes are located throughout the structure of plant which translocate a diverse set of metal ions
 <cit> . previous studies in arabidopsis thaliana have confirmed the physiological functions of the hmas  that is to detoxify zinc from chloroplast and signal cd accumulation in the vacuoles and plasma membrane
 <cit> .

cd/cu causes the formation of reactive oxygen species 
 <cit>  that damage membrane permeability and function. peroxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids generate malondialdehyde , the most abundant aldehydic lipid breakdown product
 <cit>  that indicates the levels of stress and injury to the functional membrane. to counteract these of stress conditions, plant hormones also play a central role. for example, jasmonic acid  and salicylic acid  are involved in defense-related signaling during stress conditions. in addition, abscisic acid , a stress-responsive hormone, is involved with stomatal closure to ensure plants do not lose a substantial amount of water
 <cit> .

to mitigate and reduce the negative effects of heavy metals, various prospects have been evaluated. silicon  has been found to serve as a beneficial element for plant growth and development
 <cit> . it is the second most abundant element in soil and readily absorbed; terrestrial plants contain it at an appreciable concentration, 1% to 10% or even higher in plant dry matter
 <cit> . si is an essential component of rice plants and its accumulation is helpful in maintaining sustainable production
 <cit> . the physiological functions of si have been studied extensively and si is known as an essential constituent of plants and fertilizers
 <cit> . numerous studies have revealed that si is a beneficial element to higher plants, particularly grasses and various cultivated crops like rice, wheat, tomato, and cucumber
 <cit> . over the last decade, studies have revealed the ability of si to mitigate various biotic  and abiotic stresses  in crop plants
 <cit> . ma et al.
 <cit>  has reported that si influx and efflux strongly regulate a set genes, oryza satica low silicon rice  <dig> and  <dig> , in the plasma membrane of rice plant cells. oslsi <dig> is localized at the distal side of the cell while oslsi <dig> is confined to the proximal side of the same cell and both are arranged on casparian strips
 <cit> . the role of these two genes in si transport and stress conditions is still unknown. to understand these interactions, the aim of this study was to assess the role of oslsi <dig> and oslsi <dig> during heavy metal  exposure to rice plants under si treatments. we also investigated the role of hmas during heavy metal toxicity and their regulation during the application of si. in response to metal stress, the regulation of the phytohormones salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and jasmonic acid were also analyzed.

RESULTS
si improves rice plant growth under heavy metal exposure
the effect of si and heavy metal  treatments on rice plant growth was assessed after different time points . the results showed that si application significantly increased plant growth attributes as compared with the control plants  under normal growth conditions. after 24 h exposure to heavy metal stress, cu significantly affected the shoot and root lengths of rice plants as compared to cd. after  <dig> and  <dig> days of cu or cd treatments, the shoot growth was significantly reduced as compared with control and si treatment .

metal stress has significantly decreased the root length of rice plants as compared to control plants under normal growth conditions. treatment with cd, in particular, significantly affected the root architecture and reduced the root length as compared with plants treated with cu, cu + si or cd + si after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dat. in case of chlorophyll content, after one day, si and si + cu had no significant difference as compared to control, but these treatments had higher chlorophyll than cd, cu, and cd + si treatments. after  <dig> and  <dig> days of treatment, the chlorophyll content was significantly higher in si-treated plants as compared to metal stressed plants .

the heavy metals treatment has adversely affected the biomass  and phenotypic characters of rice plants. although, there was no significant effect on the biomass or phenotypic characteristics after si and non-si treated metal stress after day  <dig> . however, we observed a significant difference after  <dig> and  <dig> days of metal stress in si-treated plants, where a significantly higher biomass  of shoots and roots was observed. the biomass of the shoots and roots was also significantly different with si treatment as compared to non-metal-treated control plants. in terms of phenotypic characteristics, leaf damage and necrosis were pronounced with cd treatment  after  <dig> and  <dig> dat. phenotypic characteristics were also significantly ameliorated with si application after  <dig> and 10-dat because si treatment with metal stress showed relatively lower rates of necrosis and leaf damage.

si affects heavy metal transport in the roots of rice plants
cd/cu ions concentration was measured in the rice roots after the application of metal stress and si. cd concentration was undetected in the control, si and cu treatments after  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> days. however, cd accumulation in rice plants with cd-treatment was significantly higher than si + cd at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat . the cd concentration was approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher in the cd-treated rice compared to si + cd at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat, respectively.

mean ± standard error from three replications per treatment. nd, not detected; dat, days after treatment. in the column, the same letters indicate not significant difference  by duncan’s multiple range test .

the cu concentration was not significantly different in the control, cd, and si + cd treated plants at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat. on the other hand, cu accumulation was significantly higher in the cu-treated plants as compared with the si + cu plants after  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat. the cu accumulation was approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold higher in cu-treated plants compared with the si + cu at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat, respectively.

si accumulation in rice roots was significantly different in cd and cu-treated rice plants compared to the control after  <dig>   <dig> and 10-dat. however, the level of si accumulation was significantly higher in plants treated with si + cu, or si + cd after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dat. overall, the si + cu treatment accumulated si in higher quantities in the roots compared to the si + cd rice plants after  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat .

si improves root morphology during metal stress treatment
to assess the effects of metal stress and si treatment on root morphology and structure, sections  from the rice roots were obtained from each sample at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat. light microscopic analysis showed that the exodermis , epidermis , endodermis  and cortex regions of the plants treated with cd or cu were slightly affected as compared to si-treated control roots at 1-dat . the cellular spaces were wider in the non-si-treated plant roots and the suberin lamellae were partially broken at instant places . in contrast, the suberin lamellae of the ex, ep, and cortex regions in the si and metal-treated plants  were fully developed and lacked any visible deformities. in the cortex regions, the damage was more vigorous in cu and cu + si compared with cd and cd + si at 1-dat .

the deleterious effects of cd and cu were more severe after  <dig> and 10-dat. although the stele and epidermal suberin lamellae were still intact, the en and cortex regions were severely damaged and poorly differentiated. the root cellular apparatus was severely broken and damaged at 10-dat after exposure to cd and cu stress. the cu-treated roots, compared to cd, were more deformed in shape and size; moreover, the cu-treated tissue parts were poorly differentiated. in case of si and metal treatment, endodermal suberin lamellae were closer to each other, while fewer walls were damaged in the cd + si plants compared to plants treated with cd and cu alone . in cu + si and cd + si treatments, the negative effects of metal stress were substantially less, although the cortex cellular lamellae were broken at various places. these effects were more pronounced in cu + si compared with cd + si treatments. after 10-dat, the adverse effects were further evident in the cu + si plants than in the cd + si plants. altogether, this indicates that si application has an ameliorative role in the cd stress regulation  in root morphology of rice plants.

si regulates phytohormones during heavy metal stress
plant hormones were regulated during the stress conditions with or without the application of silicon. upon cd/cu treatments, the endogenous abscisic acid  content was significantly increased in  <dig> and 5-dat. aba was initially higher with cu treatments as compared to cd; however, the opposite was observed at 5-dat. although the aba levels were still higher compared with the si-treated control plants at 5-dat, the application of si significantly lowered the aba levels under metal stress. at 10-dat, the cu or cd treatment had slightly higher aba levels compared to the control . in si treatment, the aba content was significantly up-regulated with si + cd/cu treatments compared to the control at  <dig> and 5-dat and also with the sole cd/cu treatment at 10-dat. the results suggest that si initially counteracted the responses to heavy metal stress; however, with increasing stress periods, the stress-responsive aba was exponentially activated.

the response pattern of endogenous jasmonic acid  was different from aba. in a previous study
 <cit> , si application to rice plants reduced ja biosynthesis under wounding stresses. in this study, heavy metal stress caused a similar ja response. the ja content was significantly higher with sole cd stress compared with cu stress. in si treatment, comparing the si and si + cd/cu treatment, the ja content from cd/cu treatments was significantly up-regulated. the ja level was not significantly different between the si + cd and si + cu treatments and the different stress periods did not affect the ja content during si application. our results suggest si application reduces ja biosynthesis under heavy metal stress .

silicon application increased the synthesis of salicylic acid  depending on the duration of the cd/cu stress . the effect of sa biosynthesis was not significantly different between the cd and cu treatment alone at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat. the sa content was 2 ~  <dig> fold higher with cu or cd treatments than in the control, si, si + cu, or si + cd treatments . si application and metal stress had no significant effect on the sa quantities at 1-dat, but at 5-dat and 10-dat, the sa content was significantly higher in cd compared to cu .

the results of our phytohormonal analyses showed that the content of aba, sa and ja exponentially increase with cd/cu stress compared to si treatments. similarly, periodic exposure initially increased phytohormonal responses with cd/cu treatment compared to the si treatments. we also observed cross-talk in the hormonal responses to cd/cu.

si decreases lipid peroxidation activity and affects fatty acid composition under heavy metal stress
the level of lipid peroxidation was measured from the malondialdehyde  content . lipid peroxidation was significantly higher with the cd/cu treatments at  <dig> and 5-dat compared to si + cd/cu. the mda level in plants with si and metal stress after 1-dat was not significantly different from the control; however, at  <dig> and 10-dat, the mda levels were significantly higher compared to control. the analyses also showed low level of lipid membrane degradation with si application compared to non-si plants under metal stress .

to further analyze the lipid membrane damage, three fatty acids , linoleic acid  and linolenic acid  were quantified in rice plants treated with metals and si . the percentages of fatty acids at 1-dat were not significantly different for all the treatments. at  <dig> and 10-dat, however, the percentage of c 18: <dig> was significantly reduced with the cd/cu treatment compared to the control, and cd/cu with si treatments had higher levels of c 18: <dig> compared to the cd/cu treatments alone . c 16: <dig> and c 18: <dig> showed the opposite trend; at 1-dat, there were no significant differences between the treatments, but at  <dig> and 10-dat, these fatty acids were significantly higher in the cd/cu-treatment compared to the si + cd/cu-treatments .

si inhibits expressions of oshma <dig> and oshma <dig> under heavy metal stress
according to previous reports of hussain et al.
 <cit> , andrés-colás et al.
 <cit> , courbot et al.
 <cit> , lee et al.
 <cit> , nocito et al.
 <cit> , and satoh-nagasawa et al.
 <cit> , heavy metal atpases  are key regulators of the heavy metal stress responses and transport in most of the higher plants. we assessed the expressions of hma genes  in rice plants. the mrna expressions of oshma <dig> and oshma <dig> were analyzed in si, non-si and cd/cu treatments . the relative expression of oshma <dig> at 1-dat was significantly higher with cd/cu treatments compared to si-treatments. oshma <dig> was also higher with the cd/cu + si treatments compared with sole si and control but was significantly lower than the cd/cu treatments without si. a similar tendency was observed at 5-dat; however, at 10-dat, oshma <dig> was not exponentially expressed compared with the other treatments. the mrna expression of oshma <dig> was similar at  <dig> and 5-dat, but after 10-dat, it was significantly increased in the non-si cu rice plants compared with si + cd/cu and cd-treated plants .

si increases the expression of oslsi <dig> and oslsi <dig> under heavy metal stress
the oryza sativa low silicon genes  regulate si influx and efflux in the roots of rice plants
 <cit> . to assess the heavy metal stress-induced regulation of these two genes with si, we determined the mrna expression level of oslsi <dig> and oslsi <dig> in rice plants . the expression level of oslsi <dig> at 1-dat revealed no significant differences between the si alone, control, and cd/cu treatments; however, it was exponentially expressed in the si + cd/cu-treated plants . similarly, the relative mrna levels of oslsi <dig> were significantly down-regulated with cd/cu application at 5-dat but highly up-regulated with si and si + cd/cu application . at 10-dat, the expression level of oslsi <dig> was down-regulated with the cd/cu treatments compared to the si-treated plants. in the si + cd/cu treatments, oslsi <dig> was also more expressed than with cd/cu treatments alone .

a similar expression pattern was observed for oslsi <dig>  the relative mrna level of oslsi <dig> at 1-dat was up-regulated with cd/cu alone and si + cd/cu treatment than in the si-treated control. however, the expression of oslsi <dig> was more highly expressed with si + cd/cu treatment compared to the cd/cu plants without si . at 5-dat, the relative mrna level of oslsi <dig> was significantly down-regulated with the cd/cu treatments compared with the control, si alone and si + cd/cu-treated plants . at 10-dat, the relative mrna level of oslsi <dig> was significantly down regulated in cd/cu and cd/cu + si than in the control and si alone. si application during cd/cu stress significantly activated the oslsi <dig> enzymes to counteract the negative effects of the heavy metals. because there was no stress during the treatment with si alone, oslsi <dig> and oslsi <dig> maintained their expression at  <dig> and 10-dat.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
heavy metals released into the environment tend to accumulate in soils and become available to plants through their roots
 <cit> . in rice paddy fields, the heavy metals cd and cu are readily absorbed into rice roots, which are transported to the shoot parts through the symplastic pathway
 <cit> . an increased concentration of cd/cu causes the inhibition of cellular processes such as photosynthesis, electron transport, and lipid peroxidation due to the binding of these metals to sulfhydryl groups
 <cit> .

we found that cd/cu application significantly affects the growth of rice plants. the rice plants had a reduction in chlorophyll content after exposure to cd/cu. chlorophyll degradation further reduced the shoot length and biomass of the rice plants after different heavy metal stress periods. in addition, the rice plants had a lower root length and biomass after an exposure to cd/cu stress. langer et al.
 <cit>  and liu et al.
 <cit>  previously found that heavy metals applied to rice plants caused a very weak root growth pattern and morphology while si ameliorated this impact. in brassica napus, cd at a low concentration  reduced the plant growth, chlorophyll content, and photosynthesis, leading to stomatal closure
 <cit> . we observed similar negative effects in the root structure of the cd/cu-treated rice plants. however, these adverse effects were greatly minimized with exogenous si-application. various physiological parameters, such as shoot and root length, biomass, and chlorophyll content were significantly higher in the si-treated plants compared to the control plants under heavy metal stress.

our results further suggest that si-treatment reduces the accumulation of heavy metals in rice roots. the accumulation of cd/cu inside the root tissues of cd/cu-treated plants was significantly higher compared with the si + cd/cu-treatments. the effects of si-application on the alleviation of cd toxicity in our experiment were comparable to previous reports where  <dig>  mm of exogenous si increased the fresh weight of rice seedlings grown in solutions contaminated with cd
 <cit> . the non-si-treated plants, on the other hand, were significantly affected by the negative effects of metal stress, as revealed in our micrographs of the rice roots. the root cell structure of the epidermis, exodermis, and cortex were seriously damaged with increasing durations of cu or cd stress, while the root structure was less affected by si treatment. in addition, cd/cu accumulation was much more pronounced with cd/cu treatment alone compared to the si-treated plants. this likely reflects the binding of heavy metals in a stable complex with further distribution inside the root, an activity minimized with the si treatments compared to the non-si plants. the possible mechanisms for si inhibition of metal transport in plants may be due to the thickening of the casparian strips in the endodermis and cell wall of the xylem causing the deposition of lignin and si in the cell walls of the dermal regions
 <cit> .

in addition, excessive cu induces leaf chlorosis due to peroxidative breakdown of the pigments and lipid membrane
 <cit> . we found that si modulated both leaf chlorosis and lipid peroxidation in rice plants. lipid peroxidation indicates oxidative stress damage on the membrane due to metal toxicity
 <cit> . the results demonstrate that lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in the cd/cu rice plants compared to the si-control; however, mda generation with si + cd/cu treatments was significantly reduced. the degree of lipid peroxidation is usually measured by the concentration of secondary breakdown products derived from these initial hydroperoxides. peroxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids generate malondialdehyde  on decomposition, and mda is typically the most abundant individual aldehydic lipid breakdown product
 <cit> . it has been estimated that more than 75% of the measured mda is derived from α-linoleic acid
 <cit> . metal stress significantly reduced the percentage of α-linoleic acid, suggesting a higher attack from reactive oxygen species  at the lipid membrane compared to plants provided with si. we conclude that having high concentrations of α-linolenic acid in chloroplasts and mitochondria, via the production of small oxygenated compounds such as mda, signal and absorb ros generated in these organelles. this proposed route for the elimination of ros would be hemi-metabolic because it is initiated by non-enzymatic fatty acid fragmentation
 <cit> .

alpha-linolenic acid, on the other hand, serves as a precursor of ja, a potent lipid molecule essential for signaling defenses during stress
 <cit> . ja can act synergistically or antagonistically with other hormones, like salicylic acid . sa plays a key role in regulating physiological processes, such as plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses
 <cit> , protection from ros through antioxidant production, induction of gene expression, and absorption and distribution of elements under heavy metal stress conditions
 <cit> . higher levels of sa suggest an increased mitigation of ros during metal stress. interestingly, we found that si treatment significantly lowers sa modulation during metal stress. while there was also a significant reduction of ja in the si-treated plants under metal-induced stress, this is opposite to the effects we observed for si on lipid peroxidation and fatty acid saturation. the release of α-linolenic acid from plant membrane lipids by stress-activated lipases is thought to provide a substrate for lipoxygenase and the subsequent synthesis of ja
 <cit> . because the si-treated plants were less affected by metal stress, perhaps the rice plant is able to consume less α-linolenic acid for synthesizing ja. however, these dynamics are still unclear and extensive studies on si and ja modulation during stress periods are required.

abscisic acid , on the other hand, was significantly lower in si-treated plants at 1-dat and 5-dat, but then increased at 10-dat in the si + metal-treated plants compared to the metal-treated plants. aba plays an important role during many phases of the plant life cycle, including seed development and dormancy, and plant responses to various environmental stresses
 <cit> . some studies have reported that aba content increases in plants exposed to cu and cd pollution
 <cit> , resulting in reduced stomatal conductance and hence, affecting photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis. these effects were ameliorated with si treatment during metal stress and thus less aba was formed. in our results, the aba level was significantly reduced with si treatment. aba has an antagonistic behavior with ja/sa biosynthesis during si treatment, suggesting an active role of aba during si and stress application. this is further confirmed by gene expression profile indicating salinity stress and aba biosynthesis .

our results also showed that oslsi expressions were significantly higher in si-treated plants at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10-dat during cd/cu stress, while in the non-si-treated plant these were not expressed or expressed at low levels. the results suggest an active accumulation of si via the roots, permitting its efficient deposition in the roots and shoots . oslsi <dig> is mainly expressed in the root parts at the plasma membrane
 <cit> . si deposition in the roots provides additional strength to the root structure for counteracting the intruding toxic metal ions, revealed in our micrographs after cd/cu stress. large amounts of si aggregate in the exodermis and endodermis
 <cit>  and after  <dig> and 5-dat, we observed less damage to the exodermis and endodermis regions of the roots compared to the non-si plants during cd/cu stress. our results suggest a higher accumulation of si in the roots reduced the influx of heavy metal. thus, heavy metal transport was reduced in the si treated plants compared to the non-si plants. similar results were revealed in the expression analysis of oshma <dig> and oshma <dig>  the results also showed that during cu/cd stress, the oslsi genes were not activated vigorously compared to oshma <dig>  however, after si application in combination with the cu/cd treatments, both oshma <dig> and oslsi genes activated significantly to counteract the negative impacts of the metal stress. this further evidence supports our results of increase si accumulation and amelioration of the plant growth attributes. this synergistic activation of oshma <dig> and oslsi genes also showed that during metal stress, the root morphology was less disturbed compared to sole application of cu/cd. in conclusion, the findings of our study suggest a protective mechanism of si during heavy metal stress. these results suggest that the application of si may be an effective method for controlling cd/cu transfer from contaminated paddy soil into the food chain.
