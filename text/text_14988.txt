BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is a re-emerging bacterial zoonosis of global importance caused by spirochetes of the genus leptospira  <cit> . dogs can be infected with a wide range of pathogenic leptospira serovars and shed the leptospires in their urine during acute infection  <cit> . leptospires can survive for months in water and moist soil  <cit> , and indirect transmission through contact with contaminated soil or water is thought to play an important role in the epidemiology of leptospirosis.

in europe, canine leptospirosis in dogs has gained increasing attention in the last several years  <cit> . following infection with pathogenic leptospires, dogs can develop a severe, multi-systemic disease associated with high mortality  <cit> . besides this severe course of infection, mild clinical signs and asymptomatic infections have been documented. acute leptospirosis in dogs is mainly associated with acute kidney or liver injury and respiratory signs associated with pulmonary haemorrhage  <cit> . furthermore, myocarditis has been documented in humans with leptospirosis and has also been suspected in infected dogs  <cit> . the clinical manifestation of leptospirosis depends not only on the causative serovar but also on host-specific factors such as age and the immune status of the dog  <cit> .

the most commonly used diagnostic test for leptospirosis in dogs is the demonstration of antibodies in the microscopic agglutination test . serial dilutions of patient sera are thereby incubated with a selection of pathogenic leptospira serovars, and agglutination of the organisms is assessed by darkfield microscopy. cross-reactivity among serovars only allows for a serogroup-specific diagnosis, and positive titres following vaccination, previous exposure and during chronic asymptomatic infection complicate the interpretation of the results  <cit> . generally, the serovar that gives the highest titre is regarded as the infecting serogroup or serovar, although this diagnosis is, at best, presumptive  <cit> . post-vaccination titres have been assessed in small groups of dogs following vaccination with bivalent and tetravalent vaccines . these studies revealed that titres usually decline by 4 months after vaccination, although persistently high titres have been documented which have been explained by natural exposure to leptospira field serovars  <cit> . pcr can be used as an alternative diagnostic method to detect leptospiral dna in biological samples such as blood, urine or tissue. however, leptospires can only transiently be detected in the blood and urine of infected animals  <cit> , and antibiotic therapy is thought to clear bacteraemia and leptospiruria  <cit> . the detection of the agents in biological samples by bacterial culture is a definitive proof of infection  <cit> , but leptospires are fastidious organisms requiring special culture media, and they grow very slowly after  <dig> to up to 24 weeks in culture, making this diagnostic procedure impractical in a clinical setting.

despite the introduction of efficient bivalent leptospira bacterin vaccines some decades ago  <cit> , clinical leptospirosis has recently been documented among numerous vaccinated dogs in europe  <cit> . the currently licenced bivalent leptospira vaccines in europe contain serovars belonging to the serogroups canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae. these vaccines have been shown to prevent leptospirosis caused by serovars belonging to these two serogroups, but the vaccines induce only partial or no immunity to heterologous serogroups . canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae were previously thought to be the main serogroups causing clinical leptospirosis in dogs. recent seroepidemiological studies revealed, however, that dogs are susceptible to a broad range of serovars. in europe, antibodies against the serogroups icterohaemorrhagiae, canicola, grippotyphosa, pomona, australis and sejroe have most commonly been documented in clinically healthy and diseased dogs  <cit> .

in  <dig>  a new canine tetravalent inactivated leptospira vaccine  that contains antigens from serovars from four different serogroups, including canicola, icterohaemorrhagiae, australis and grippotyphosa was licenced in europe  <cit> . because serology represents the mainstay in the diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs, the serological response following vaccination can interfere with the interpretation of mat results in suspect clinical cases  <cit> . so far, no data on the serological response following vaccination with this novel tetravalent vaccine have been published. furthermore, recent pharmacovigilance reports from germany and switzerland suggest that adverse events after vaccination with leptospira vaccines have significantly increased since  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, following the introduction of novel, multivalent leptospira vaccines in these countries  <cit> . the authors of the reports speculated that the increasing number of leptospira serovars included in these vaccines could result in higher antigenicity of the vaccines. however, studies investigating the incidence of adverse events following the vaccination of dogs did not reveal a significant increase in hypersensitivity reactions following leptospira vaccination when compared with other vaccines  <cit> . finally, there have been recent anecdotal reports describing cardiac abnormalities suspicious of acute myocarditis after vaccination . specifically, at the second vaccination, new heart murmurs had been auscultated that had not been present at the first vaccination. subsequent echocardiographic examinations reportedly had revealed left ventricular dilation and hypocontractility with mitral annulus dilation and associated mitral insufficiency as the explanation for the murmur.

the goal of the present study was to evaluate the serological response of dogs after vaccination with a commercially available, inactivated, tetravalent leptospira vaccine and to investigate whether the dogs showed clinical signs and alterations in haematology, blood biochemistry and echocardiography following vaccination.

methods
study design, sample and data collection and sample processing
this monocentric, longitudinal, prospective study was performed at the clinic for small animal internal medicine, university of zurich, between august  <dig> and may  <dig>  dogs were prospectively enrolled within the study when they met the following inclusion criteria: older than 8 weeks of age, judged clinically healthy by the owner, in good general health according to clinical examination, no vaccination within 4 weeks and no medical therapy within 2 months prior to study enrolment, with the exception of antiparasitic treatment. the study design and number of dogs that received each procedure are shown in table  <dig>  the day of the first vaccination was defined as t <dig>  all dogs were vaccinated twice with a commercial tetravalent leptospirosis vaccine  3–4 weeks apart . additional vaccine components licenced for concurrent administration were applied as required . blood samples were collected by venipuncture before the first  and second vaccination  and 41–54 days  and 368–434 days after the first vaccination . blood samples were processed or frozen at −80 °c within 4 h of collection. a medical history and clinical examination were performed at each presentation by a veterinary surgeon  or a board-certified internal medicine specialist . echocardiography was performed before the first  and second vaccination  by board-certified cardiologists  at the division of cardiology, vetsuisse faculty, university of zurich. adverse vaccine events were suspected when clinical signs occurred within 5 days of vaccination and belonged to one of the following groups: lethargy or inappetence, local reaction at the injection site , non-specific signs  or a hypersensitivity reaction . data on adverse vaccine events were collected from the medical history and clinical examination performed at each presentation.table  <dig> study design and number of dogs that received each procedure




haematology, blood biochemistry and ctroponin i
haematology and blood biochemistry tests and measurements of ctroponin i were performed at the clinical laboratory, vetsuisse faculty, university of zurich. haematology was performed from edta anti-coagulated whole blood within 4 h of sample collection. blood biochemistry was determined batch-wise from serum samples stored at −80 °c. haematology and blood biochemistry were run on a sysmex xt-2000iv   <cit>  and cobas integra  <dig> instrument , respectively. the clinical chemistry parameters included: albumin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin, urea, creatinine and lipase. the laboratory’s device-specific reference intervals were applied. ctroponin i was measured on an immulite  <dig> . the serum ctroponin i concentration was measured using a commercially available assay that had been validated for the dog  <cit> . the test’s lower limit of detection was  <dig>  ng/ml, and ctroponin i values exceeding  <dig>  ng/ml were considered increased.

microscopic agglutination test
the mat was performed at the national reference laboratory for animal leptospirosis at the institute of veterinary bacteriology, vetsuisse faculty﻿, university of bern, switzerland. the mat was performed batch-wise from serum samples stored at −80 °c that were sent by priority mail at room temperature to the laboratory. samples were examined for the presence of antibodies against a standard panel of  <dig> pathogenic leptospira strains commonly used in switzerland  by mat according to office international des epizooties  standards  <cit> . to prevent inter-observer variability, all samples were tested by the same person. the end-point titre refers to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which at least 50% agglutination occurs. in this study, sera with a titre of  <dig>  indicating past exposure to leptospira  <cit> , were considered seropositive.table  <dig> the  <dig> leptospira spp. strains used as live antigens in the microscopic agglutination testa

positive mat titres  measured after the second vaccination  were most common for the serovar canicola , followed by the serovars australis , grippotyphosa , bratislava , autumnalis , copenhageni , pomona , pyrogenes  and icterohaemorrhagiae . median to high titres  were most commonly found for the serovar canicola , followed by the serovars australis , grippotyphosa , bratislava , autumnalis , pyrogenes  and pomona ; none of the dogs developed titres ≥ <dig> for the serovars copenhageni or icterohaemorrhagiae. maximal mat titres measured at t <dig> for the serovars were as follows: canicola , australis , grippotyphosa , bratislava , autumnalis , copenhageni , pomona , pyrogenes  and icterohaemorrhagiae .

at the 1-year booster appointment , 2–18% of the dogs showed positive mat titres to serovars of the vaccine serogroups, and the titres were generally low . a total of 2–18% of the dogs showed positive mat titres to the non-vaccine serovars pomona, autumnalis, pyrogenes and ballum . the seven dogs with an mat titre of  <dig> against the serovar pyrogenes at t <dig> had negative titres against the other tested serovars at this time point and had also been seronegative for the serovar pyrogenes following the second vaccination . positive mat titres were not detected at any time point during the study for l. interrogans serovar bataviae or for l. borgpetersenii serovars tarassovi, hardjo and sejroe .

haematology, blood biochemistry and ctroponin i
the haematological parameters determined before  and after the second vaccination  revealed no significant differences, with the exception of a slight but significant increase in haematocrit  and a decrease in total monocyte count at t <dig> compared to t <dig> . for the blood biochemistry results, significant differences between t <dig> and t <dig> were only evident for the ap activity  and the urea concentration . these differences were small, and the median ap activity and urea concentration remained within the reference range at both time points. the ctroponin i concentrations were obtained in  <dig> dogs. at t <dig>  ctroponin i concentrations were below the detection limit in  <dig> dogs; two dogs  had measurable ctroponin i levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml. at t <dig>  ctroponin i concentrations were below the detection limit in  <dig> dogs; two dogs  had measurable ctroponin i levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml; both dogs had had undetectable values at t <dig>  there was no significant difference between the ctroponin i levels at t <dig> and t <dig> 

echocardiography
left ventricular  and left atrial  size did not significantly change between the first  and the second  vaccination, and mitral insufficiency could not be documented in any dog. additionally, systolic function, as assessed by lvds and %fs, did not change significantly between t <dig> and t <dig>  looking at individual dogs, there was not any dog that showed a notable increase in lvdd or lvds. in none of the dogs could any arrhythmia be recognized at any time point during the study.

discussion
this is the first independent study evaluating the serological and clinical response in field dogs following vaccination with a novel tetravalent leptospira vaccine. our results suggest that the vaccine was generally well tolerated and that there was marked variation among individual dogs and among different vaccine serovars regarding the extent of seroconversion following vaccination.

up to 23% of the dogs in this study showed clinical signs following vaccination, but they were mild and transient in all cases and did not include anaphylactoid reactions. leptospira vaccines have been said to carry an increased risk of adverse events in puppies younger than 12 weeks of age and in small-breed dogs  <cit> , but a recent study evaluating the incidence rate of owner-reported post-vaccination adverse events found no significant increase in hypersensitivity reactions in dogs vaccinated against leptospira compared with other vaccines  <cit> . in the present study, most of the adverse vaccine events included discomfort at the injection site and transient lethargy and inappetence. these are common clinical signs induced by vaccination and have also been reported for other vaccine products  <cit> . because additional vaccine components were administered in six of the eleven dogs that showed clinical signs after the first vaccination, the clinical signs could also have been attributable to other vaccine components. however, there was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between dogs that did or did not receive other vaccine components at the first or second vaccination. in this study, we decided to administer additional vaccine components as indicated to mimic the situation in the field, where leptospira vaccines are usually administered together with other vaccine components registered for concurrent application. in light of the high incidence and mortality rate of clinical leptospirosis in dogs in europe  <cit> , the benefit of vaccinating dogs with this novel tetravalent vaccine highly outweighs the risk of adverse events following vaccination.

the highest mat titres after vaccination for the tested serovars were observed for the serovars canicola, australis, grippotyphosa, bratislava and autumnalis; the mat titres were generally low  for the vaccine serovar copenhageni , with only 42% of the study population showing positive titres after the second vaccination. one recent study evaluated vaccine-associated leptospira antibodies in client-owned dogs following vaccination with four different tetravalent leptospira vaccines   <cit> . the authors found a comparable percentage of dogs with positive titres for the serovars canicola , grippotyphosa  and bratislava  after vaccination as in the present study, but in contrast to our results, 94% of the dogs developed positive titres to the serovar icterohaemorrhagiae. the four vaccines tested in the previous study were different from the vaccine used in the present study; different vaccines could vary in their potential to induce seroconversion to vaccine serovars depending on the strains used in the vaccines. alternatively, natural exposure or differences in immune status could have affected the vaccine responses of individual dogs in our study. accordingly, we observed highly variable vaccine responses among individual dogs, as also reported in previous studies  <cit> . it could be argued that we missed the maximal mat titres against the icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup, because we sampled the dogs only once 16–31 days after the second immunization, whereas a previous study followed the mat titres for several weeks following immunization  <cit> . however, martin et al. found the highest mat titres for the vaccine serovars at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> after the start of immunization, which is similar to the time point used in the present study to evaluate seroconversion following vaccination. importantly, a lack of seroconversion does not imply lack of immune protection against the vaccine serovar copenhageni. evaluating the protective potential of leptospira vaccines by use of mat titres does not provide the entire picture, because previous studies have shown that post-vaccination titres may not correlate with protection  <cit> .

seroconversion following vaccination was also observed for some non-vaccine serovars, including autumnalis, pomona and pyrogenes. this finding is not unexpected and can be explained by cross-reactivity in mat among different leptospira serovars. mat titres are not serovar-specific, and also in recent studies, dogs developed positive titres against non-vaccine serovars following vaccination with bi- and tetravalent leptospira vaccines . in one study, dogs showed even highest titres to non-vaccine serovars  <cit> . in the present study, one dog showed maximal seroconversion for the non-vaccine serovar autumnalis following vaccination, with a titre of  <dig> in mat, although the titres for all of the vaccine serovars were negative at that time except for the serovar canicola . besides vaccination, natural exposure to the serovar autumnalis coinciding with vaccination could have accounted for seroconversion in this animal. however, the dog showed no clinical signs or abnormalities in haematology and blood biochemistry compatible with leptospirosis at that time. our results indicate that even high titres  against non-vaccine serovars should be interpreted with caution in vaccinated dogs exhibiting signs consistent with leptospirosis.

half of the dogs showed positive mat titres at study enrolment for the serovar canicola, although vaccines containing this serovar had been administered to the dogs up to 1745 days prior to sampling. the dog is assumed to be a natural reservoir host of l. interrogans serovar canicola, and before the introduction of efficient vaccines, clinical leptospirosis in dogs has commonly been associated with this serovar. because the present study was performed in privately owned dogs with outdoor access, natural exposure to leptospires in addition to vaccination could have resulted in antigenic stimulation in these dogs. our results are in contrast to an earlier study that evaluated leptospira antibodies in privately owned dogs in switzerland between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in that study, 34% of the dogs showed positive leptospira antibody titres, with seroconversion to other serovars, e.g., bratislava, australis, icterohaemorrhagiae, pomona and grippotyphosa, being common. moreover, in a survey of  <dig> dogs from switzerland over a 10-year-period before the introduction of the tetravalent vaccine, only  <dig> % of the dogs showed seropositivity to serovar canicola  <cit> . we cannot conclude from the present data whether the positive mat titres to canicola were due to previous vaccination or natural exposure to this serovar. however, in light of the large time span elapsed since the last vaccination in some of the seropositive dogs, natural exposure seems likely, and vaccination against this serovar can still be advocated.

in the present study, dogs were specifically examined for evidence of myocarditis due to anecdotal reports of cardiac changes after vaccination with this new vaccine. there is some credibility to such a potential association, because natural infection with leptospirosis may, indeed, cause myocarditis. even though clinically important myocarditis is rare in dogs and people after natural infection  <cit> , subclinical myocarditis may be quite commonly present in both species based on biochemical abnormalities, specifically the elevation of ctroponin i  <cit> , and histopathological findings  <cit> . furthermore, myocarditis has been documented as an adverse event following vaccination in humans, such as after smallpox vaccination  <cit> . the present study found no echocardiographic, electrocardiographic or biochemical evidence of subclinical vaccine-induced myocarditis. based on the limited number of dogs included in the present study, myocarditis as a rare complication of leptospirosis vaccination cannot, however, completely be ruled out.

the present study has some limitations. due to the prospective study design, the number of dogs included in the study was too small to evaluate rare adverse events induced by the vaccine. this could be assessed by large retrospective studies and pharmacovigilance data. the present study also did not follow the course of the mat titres after vaccination and therefore cannot evaluate the time point of maximal mat titres and the duration of seropositivity induced by the vaccine. third, the inclusion of other vaccine components could have influenced the clinical and serological response of the dogs. however, we chose this setting to most accurately mimic the situation in the field, where leptospira vaccines are commonly administered together with other vaccine components licenced for concurrent administration. finally, measurements of ctroponin i were only obtained before the first and 16–31 days after the second vaccination. it can be argued that an elevation might have been present earlier after vaccination. however, the complete absence of any evidence of morphological, functional and electrical cardiac abnormalities makes clinically important myocardial damage very unlikely.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that the novel tetravalent leptospira vaccine nobivac® l <dig> is generally well-tolerated and that clinical signs following vaccination were mild and transient. seroconversion following vaccination differed considerably among individual dogs and among the vaccine serovars. high titres to non-vaccine serovars were present in some dogs following vaccination, which hampers the interpretation of single mat titres in vaccinated dogs with clinical signs consistent with leptospirosis. in the light of the high incidence and mortality rate associated with clinical leptospirosis in dogs in europe, vaccination with this tetravalent vaccine can be advocated for every dog with potential exposure to leptospires.
