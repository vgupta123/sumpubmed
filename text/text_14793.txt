BACKGROUND
radiation hybrid  panels were originally devised to build high resolution maps of mammalian genomes  <cit> . the panels are created by lethally irradiating a donor cell  harboring a selectable marker and propagating the resulting dna fragments by fusing the donor cells with the recipient hamster cell line a <dig>  each clone in an rh panel contains a random assortment of the donor dna permitting construction of a physical map. since high doses of radiation can be used, a large number of breakpoints can be obtained, >  <dig> in a typical panel of ~ <dig> clones.

rh panels exhibit copy number variation  for essentially all genes and represent a powerful resource for unbiased examination of cnv-induced effects on gene expression. the existence of cnvs across multiple clones in a panel boosts statistical power.

studies that map quantitative trait loci  regulating gene expression  usually rely on naturally occurring polymorphisms as a source of genetic variation and meiotic recombination to narrow down the regulatory loci. frequently, the mechanistic significance of naturally occurring polymorphisms in affecting gene expression is not immediately apparent from the context. genetic alterations due to cnvs have recently come to the fore as a source of considerable polymorphism in humans  <cit> . in contrast to other polymorphisms, a one to one correspondence between copy number and gene expression is, on its face, a reasonable expectation for cnvs although exceptions have been noted  <cit> . since the variation in rh cells is due to cnvs, we refer to loci affecting expression in the rh panels copy number eqtls or ceqtls. however, unlike naturally occurring cnvs, variation in the rh panels is uniform and genome-wide.

recently, array comparative genomic hybridization  and gene expression microarrays were used to fine map loci regulating expression genome-wide in a mouse-hamster radiation hybrid panel  <cit> . the analysis of the mouse rh panel revealed a number of unexpected findings. these included the fact that ~30% of genes showed decreased gene expression in response to increased copy number, a potentially novel form of dosage compensation for the × chromosome independent of × chromosome inactivation, and the existence of ceqtls in noncoding regions of the genome.

to further investigate these surprising findings, we used the stanford g <dig> radiation hybrid panel  <cit> . the  <dig> clones in this panel are derived from a human male donor genome. we also used publicly available glioblastoma multiforme  data from the cancer genome atlas . we found consistent overlap between the human rh, mouse rh and tcga data in terms of regulated pathways for genes with negative correlation between cnvs and expression data and attenuated response of x-linked genes in response to copy number increase. in addition, we found ceqtls in non-genic regions in the two rh datasets and that these nongenic ceqtls could not be explained by recently discovered exotic transcripts in noncoding regions harboring ceqtls.

RESULTS
gene expression
rna was extracted from each of the  <dig> available radiation hybrid clones and technical replicates hybridized to illumina humanref- <dig> v <dig>  beadchips. the relative hybridization efficiencies of hamster and human transcripts on the arrays were comparable  and there was good reproducibility between duplicate arrays .

assessing copy number and retention frequency in the g <dig> rh panel
to measure dna copy number in the rh cell lines, we used array comparative genomic hybridization  of each clone compared to the reference hamster a <dig> recipient line. the acgh genotyping agreed well with the historical pcr genotyping  . the average loss of pcr markers across all rh cells was  <dig> %. this loss is likely due to the multiple passages of the rh clones since its creation a decade ago. almost no gain of markers  was observed. individual cell lines showed large variation in loss, ranging from 3-96%. the final retention frequency  was  <dig> %. the average donor dna fragment length was  <dig> mb.

across the  <dig> available clones in the g <dig> rh panel, the entire human genome is represented, on average, nine times  , although a few regions were extreme. as expected, the retention of the region surrounding thymidine kinase , the selectable marker used in creating the panel was 100%. human centromeric regions were preferentially retained in the rh cell lines  , as found previously  <cit> . this observation implies that human centromeres function efficiently in hamster cells despite lineage differences  <cit> .

gene expression changes with copy number
we used a previously described linear regression model  <cit>  to relate changes in gene expression to copy number in the  <dig> available clones . briefly, the log <dig>  of each gene served as the dependent variable while the log <dig>  cgh intensity served as the regressor. the change in expression due to copy number is characterized by an effect size parameter α . if α =  <dig>  gene expression is exactly proportional to copy number. the significance of α was assessed by permutation testing .

we defined a cis ceqtl as a locus within a  <dig> mb radius of a regulated gene . trans ceqtls were defined as loci regulating genes at a distance greater than  <dig> mb or on another chromosome . to account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied false discovery rates  to cis and trans ceqtls separately  <cit> . we used an fdr threshold of <  <dig>  for our ceqtls in the human data giving  <dig>  cis ceqtls. in mouse, the same threshold gave  <dig>  cis ceqtls. for trans ceqtls, we also used fdr <  <dig>  in both mouse and human data. these fdrs correspond to p values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for cis and trans ceqtls, respectively in the human rh data .

cis ceqtls and genes that turn down their own expression
the median distance between a gene and its cis ceqtl was  <dig> kb . cis ceqtl effect sizes  showed a bimodal distribution with means of  <dig>  and - <dig>  for positive and negative α's, respectively. . a total of  <dig>  of  <dig>   cis ceqtls decreased their gene expression when their copy number was increased . in our mouse rh, 30% of cis α were negative at fdr <  <dig> .

after identifying ~ <dig>  orthologous genes between mouse and human, we determined the number of common genes whose expression correlated with copy number to be  <dig> . human and mouse possessed  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes whose expression increased with copy number respectively and  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes whose expression was inversely correlated with copy number respectively.  <dig>  genes had positive α and  <dig> had negative α in both human and mouse data. a chi-square test showed enrichment of both positive cis α and negative cis α ceqtls across both species , suggesting that negative cis α ceqtls are not simply due to noise. using a more stringent cutoff of fdr 5% in the human rh data,  <dig> negative correlations still persist. in the mouse rh data at an fdr of 5%,  <dig> negative correlations still exist and the overlap of  <dig> genes with negative α is statistically significant .

we employed david  <cit>  to search the gene ontology for functional enrichment of genes with negative cis α in the human and mouse rh datasets . there was a high degree of functional conservation for genes with negative cis α with the most enriched categories involving membrane functions, receptor activity and signaling. consistent with this observation, a mann-whitney rank test of the go scores between the two data sets was significant . the trend was less clear among genes with positive cis α in the mouse and human  with categories such as metabolic process, regulation of apoptosis and binding highly conserved between the two species.

a recent study of cells trisomic for each of the mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  provided an opportunity to test our negative cis α ceqtls and further rule out noise as a cause of this surprising phenomenon. similar to the analysis of the rh panels, we used linear regression to estimate effect sizes due to copy number increases in the aneuploid cells. out of  <dig>  orthologous genes between mouse rh and mouse trisomy data,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cis ceqtls had positive cis α in the trisomy and mouse rh data respectively and  <dig> and  <dig> possessed negative cis α respectively. a chi-square test showed enrichment of both positive cis α and negative cis α ceqtls . we repeated this test using human rh and mouse aneuploidy data  and found a highly significant overlap of  <dig> genes with negative cis α . the replicability of the negative α findings across these datasets argues in favor of a true biological phenomenon.

absolute expression levels of genes with positive cis α is statistically significant from genes with negative cis α , although this difference is due to a fraction of highly expressed genes with positive cis α . the mean gene expression values were quite close . cis ceqtls with negative alpha show little evidence of antisense transcription  and the genes underlying them were largely found in their entirety across all  <dig> rh cell lines . in addition, neighboring markers nearly always had concordant α .

decreased cis effects on x chromosome
genes on the x chromosome in the human rh dataset showed a significantly attenuated cis response to increased copy number compared to the autosomes . the same phenomenon was also found in our mouse dataset, where the mean cis α on the x chromosome was significantly less  than the autosomes  <cit>  . we performed a paired t-test by evaluating the average positive cis α for autosomes and x chromosomes for each human rh clone and found a significant difference  between the two. the same was true for negative cis α  . both the human donor and a <dig> hamster cells used to construct the hybrids are male. because donor chromosomes are fragmented by irradiation and concatenated to other random fragments upon incorporation into the recipient cell line, possible activation of the donor xist locus would not consistently silence all x chromosome genes. since the retention frequency of the donor x chromosome is only  <dig> % , activation of the recipient hamster xist locus would render the rh clones functionally haploid for most of the x chromosome and would be inviable. thus the attenuated cis ceqtl effect size on the x chromosome implies a xist-independent dosage compensation mechanism for x-linked genes.

cis ceqtls in cancer and rh cells have similar properties
using glioblastoma multiforme  cancer data publicly available from the cancer genome atlas  project, we applied linear regression to estimate cis copy number effects on gene expression and then compared the results to our human and mouse rh panels. while not a perfect analogue to rh panels, cancer often possess alterations in copy number which would be expected to influence gene expression. in the cancer data,  <dig> % of the human genome showed copy number variation. x chromosomal coverage was  <dig> %. similar to the rh analysis, we employed a  <dig> mb radius for cis effects and corrected p values such that fdr <  <dig>  .

at fdr <  <dig> ,  <dig>  genes in the tcga dataset showed cis effects between copy number and gene expression of which  <dig>  were common to the human rh data. human rh and tcga had  <dig>  and  <dig>  cis ceqtls with positive α and  <dig>  and  <dig> cis ceqtls with negative α. enrichment of cis ceqtls that had positive and negative α in both data sets  was demonstrated by chi-square . the same was true for tcga and mouse rh . the number of genes with negative correlation between copy number and gene expression in common between the tcga, human rh and mouse rh datasets is  <dig> . despite the modest number of overlapping genes, the go categories for the  <dig> genes with negative correlation between copy number and expression in the cancer data were strikingly similar to the rh genes with negative α and included categories of plasma membrane, signaling and receptor activity . a mann-whitney rank test between tcga and human rh go scores was significant .

we sought confirmation of decreased cis effects on the x chromosome in tcga data. we used male tcga samples  to exclude the effects of x chromosome inactivation . however, similar conclusions were drawn from female tcga data . in relation to the autosomes, mean gene expression on the x chromosome in the male tcga samples showed a significant attenuation in response to increased copy number . we divided x-linked and autosomal genes in the tcga data into positively and negatively regulating cis ceqtls and found that genes on the x chromosome possessed smaller effect sizes than the autosomes . this is similar to what we observed in both human and mouse rh panels where effect sizes for genes on x were smaller in magnitude than autosomes . considering the selective pressure in cancer cells and the corresponding lack of uniform coverage compared to rh cells, overall, tcga data is consistent with the findings of negative cis ceqtls and the attenuated x-linked copy number/expression relationships in the rh datasets.

trans ceqtls
there were a total of  <dig>  trans loci at an fdr <  <dig> . of the  <dig>  trans interactions between peak markers and genes in the human rh data,  <dig> have negative α  while the remaining  <dig>   have positive α .

both the mouse and human rh datasets had genes regulated by multiple loci . to test for conservation of hotspots regulating multiple genes in trans  in human and mouse, we remapped mouse ceqtls onto the human genome using the ucsc liftover utility. we then binned the human genome into  <dig> mb bins and performed a chi-square test on the number of genes regulated by each bin in the two rh datasets. the result was not significant.

we then investigated the overlap of genes underlying trans ceqtls between human and mouse rh data. for this analysis, we found the closest genes to regulating trans ceqtls and counted the number of overlapping genes between the two species whenever orthologous genes could be identified. for regulating trans ceqtls,  <dig>  genes were found in mouse while  <dig>  were found in human. the overlap of  <dig>  was significant by chi-square test .

we also examined the effect of trans ceqtls regulating x chromosomal genes. the difference in effect sizes between autosomal and xchromosomal loci was significant for positive α  but much weaker than for cis ceqtls. there were too few observations to test negative α  on the x chromosome . the x chromosome attenuation phenomenon appears to be specific for cis ceqtls.

trans ceqtls are functionally enriched
contrary to a yeast eqtl dataset  <cit> , trans ceqtls in our original mouse rh dataset were enriched for go categories related to transcription. we tested the enrichment of gene ontology categories using david for  <dig>  genes closest to a trans ceqtl in our human rh data at fdr <  <dig> . the top  <dig> categories for the biological process ontology are displayed in table  <dig> alongside enrichment results from our mouse rh dataset at the same threshold. a mann-whitney rank test on the go category scores between these two datasets provides strong evidence of similarity . complete results are shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

categories showing enrichment in the human rh data included signaling, development, binding, plasma membrane, and cytoskeleton. remarkably, many of these same categories were enriched in the mouse dataset, showing conservation of function between the two species among trans ceqtls, particularly ion related categories. transcription factor related categories were enriched only in the mouse rh data at fdr <  <dig> . however, transcription factor activity was enriched in the human rh data at fdr <  <dig> .

regulatory loci in noncoding regions
at fdr <  <dig> , a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>   of trans ceqtls mapped to noncoding regions of the human genome. we considered a ceqtl as noncoding if it was >  <dig> kb away from a known gene or microrna according to ucsc's hg <dig> or mm <dig> gene location tables. the choice of a  <dig> kb cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, but it exceeds twice the - 2log <dig> p support radius  used in this study.

assuming that closely linked ceqtl peaks represent individual loci regulating multiple genes, we merged noncoding ceqtls if the peaks were <  <dig> kb from each other . at fdr <  <dig> , there were  <dig> noncoding ceqtls in human and  <dig> in mouse. since some noncoding ceqtls in mouse map to more than one noncoding ceqtl in human , we enforced a rigorous one-to-one mapping of mouse noncoding blocks to human noncoding blocks resulting in  <dig> possible noncoding blocks in common between the two species. chi-square analysis of the number of shared blocks containing ceqtls  between mouse and human  between the two species was not significant. at a more liberal threshold of fdr <  <dig> , the overlap of noncoding blocks was significant . figure  <dig> shows the co-localization of mouse and human noncoding ceqtl blocks on the human genome.

we applied gene set enrichment analysis  <cit>  to the genes regulated by the eight syntenic noncoding ceqtls with the highest -log <dig> p values in both mouse and human datasets . no pair of mouse-human gene lists regulated by a common ceqtl had an overlap in their enriched go categories. however, we found one noncoding ceqtl located on the mouse x chromosome at  <dig>  mb and the syntenic region of the human × chromosome at  <dig>  mb that affected expression of an overlapping set of gene targets regulated by  <dig> micrornas . the noncoding ceqtl itself did not harbor any micrornas according to mirscan .

micrornas in noncoding regions
the existence of noncoding trans ceqtls suggested there may be unknown genomic elements in those regions. one possibility included unidentified micrornas. we used mirscan  <cit>  to screen the positionally conserved noncoding ceqtls with fdr <  <dig> . no regions resulted in significant mirscan scores.

known noncoding elements do not explain noncoding ceqtls
several recent reports using next-generation rna-seq and chip-seq methods have found evidence of novel genes and functional rnas in noncoding regions, illuminating the role of "dark dna". we examined the positional overlap of three such datasets. the first was a deep rna-seq study of the mouse transcriptome which revealed evidence of novel genes  <cit> . in a chip-seq study, a new class of large intervening noncoding rnas  was identified due to the preferential association of histone h <dig> trimethylated at either lysine <dig> or lysine <dig> with these elements  <cit> . ultraconserved regions  <cit>  are noncoding regions >  <dig> bp perfectly conserved across multiple species. they possess no known function, yet appear to be under purifying selection.

the overlap between these three classes of newly discovered functional elements and our human noncoding ceqtls at fdr <  <dig>  was sparse  . only  <dig> % of the mouse rh noncoding ceqtl blocks overlap with these same elements . although we used a relatively liberal fdr <  <dig>  to identify the >  <dig> noncoding ceqtls, the number of true noncoding ceqtls is still expected to be ~ <dig>  this greatly exceeds the number of lincrnas, ultraconserved regions and novel genes, suggesting these elements cannot be the regulatory elements underlying most of our noncoding ceqtls. the -log <dig> p values of the trans noncoding ceqtls closest to either lincrnas or novel genes were among the lower scoring , implying that the majority of the noncoding ceqtls represent novel but still undefined biological regulators.

while enhancers are known to affect gene expression at a distance, none of the non-coding ceqtls can represent these regulatory elements. unlike meiotic mapping, a breakpoint in rh mapping physically separates a regulatory element from its corresponding gene. the element is instead placed next to a randomly selected gene in each rh clone and will not act as a consistent trans regulatory locus.

comparison of rh data with normal tissues
in order to evaluate our artificial human rh system against an in vivo biological data set, we compared the gene expression from the rh experiments to the human novartis symatlas  <cit> , a compendium of gene expression across multiple tissues. using a common set of  <dig>  genes, we constructed a correlation matrix of expression for gene pairs across the rh panel and a similar matrix across the  <dig> tissues of the symatlas. we then subtracted the two matrices and computed the frobenius norm  to quantify the distance between the two data sets. to generate a null distribution, the gene expression values from the rh data were permuted, a new correlation matrix was computed and subtracted from the symatlas correlation matrix and the frobenius norm recomputed. of  <dig>  permutations, none showed a score smaller than the observed score  . this result suggests that pair-wise gene expression changes obtained from copy number variation in the rh panel are similar to those obtained from regulated gene expression in multiple tissues of a mammalian organism.

discussion
the relationship between copy number and gene expression has only begun to be explored as most studies are focused on identifying regions of copy number variation   <cit> . the first studies to extensively explore cnv effects on expression in mice highlighted the potential for widespread impact of cnvs on shaping the transcriptome of various tissues  <cit> . recent studies of cnv effects on gene expression in human and mouse rely upon naturally occurring variation  and have been limited to cis effects  <cit> . radiation hybrid panels allow a genome-wide survey of gene expression changes due to copy number increases and are not limited to regions of previously identified cnvs.

several lines of evidence support the broader applicability of rh panels in understanding gene expression networks. though highly multiplexed, rh panels are not unlike other systems such as transgenic organisms or transfected cell lines which have given useful biologically insights. phenotypic mapping experiments using radiation hybrids have successfully located human and murine viral entry proteins  <cit>  by exploiting the ability of rh clones to correctly express exogenous genes and synthesize and post-translationally modify the resulting proteins. recent sequencing efforts of the hamster genome showed that coding sequences are 88% conserved with human  <cit> .

the gene-gene correlation between human rh and symatlas datasets also implies no substantial difference in gene expression between our human rh panels and in vivo gene expression for the  <dig>  genes we tested. one caveat is their different sources of genetic variation so this result should be considered in context with other available evidence. unlike genetic coexpression studies, the high resolution of the rh approach allowed construction of directed genetic networks from the mouse rh data. these directed networks showed significant overlap with other networks including protein-protein interaction and coexpression networks  <cit> . adding the human rh data will improve the resolution and power of the directed rh genetic networks giving additional insights into the hierarchical circuitry of gene regulation.

using a human-hamster rh panel, a mouse-hamster rh panel, an aneuploid mouse dataset and publicly available tcga data, we present strong evidence that many genes possess the ability to decrease their gene expression in response to increased copy number . in the mouse and human rh datasets, 30% of genes show this ability compared to 6% of surveyed tcga genes. some of this is likely due to the difference in coverage: the entire human/mouse genome was represented in the rh panels while only 38% of the genome was covered in tcga data. a small number of negative cis alphas have been reported in human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> , but the rh approach is the first to interrogate the entire mammalian genome.

additional factors may underlie some of these negative cis ceqtls, but are unable to account for the totality of negative cis ceqtls. antisense transcription plays no significant role and the inclusion of partial length genes in each rh clone could maximally account for only a minority  of negative cis ceqtls.

across the rh and tcga data, the most enriched gene ontology categories for genes that decrease expression in response to increased copy number involved signaling, receptor activity and membrane functions. this finding is new and suggests that signaling pathways are tightly regulated and may possess autoregulatory feedback to compensate for increased copy number. signaling genes were recently found to be enriched among human cnvs  <cit>  and under positive selective pressure  <cit> , possibly because negative cis α values confer a regulatory robustness in the face of sequence changes. study of individual genes should reveal details of the responsible mechanisms.

we found  <dig> common genes with negative cis α between the two rh and tcga data sets . surprisingly, the relatively modest overlap in the number of genes still yields a high degree of similarity in go categories across the three data sets suggesting conserved pathways are affected.

we observed that cis ceqtls on the human x chromosome showed substantially lower effect sizes than autosomes - a discovery we first noted in the mouse rh panel. the attenuation of the relationship between dosage and expression is independent of xist mediated x chromosome inactivation and may represent a form of previously unseen dosage compensation in mammals. in placental mammals, x chromosome inactivation occurs through the expression of xist, a noncoding rna on the future inactive x chromosome   <cit> . transcribed sequences from the xist locus coat the xi-elect by binding nongenic regions of the x chromosome  <cit> . the predicted secondary rna structure of xist possesses two stem loops and may serve as a scaffold for silencing factors  <cit> . chromatin modification  <cit> , scaffold proteins  <cit> , and polycomb proteins  <cit>  have all been implicated in the initiation and maintainance of x chromosome inactivation although the picture is far from clear. in contrast to mammals, drosophila  <cit>  and c. elegans  <cit>  both use transcriptional control for x chromosome dosage compensation. the autoregulatory control of x chromosome expression found in the human and mouse rh panels may thus represent an evolutionary remnant of these invertebrate dosage compensation mechanisms which has since been supplemented by x chromosome inactivation. the same attenuation pattern was found in male tcga data on the x chromsosome. while cancer resembles rh clones in some respects, cancer cells differ in several important aspects such as mutation, selection, heterogeneity of fragment length and differences in genome coverage.

among trans loci, we found evidence of conserved regulating genes between the human and mouse rh panels. trans ceqtls were particularly associated with genes involved in binding, signaling and ion-channel activity suggesting that these genes tend to represent network hubs and that copy number changes in these genes can contribute to non-lethal variation. we found enrichment of transcription factor activity in mouse but not human rh data at fdr <  <dig> . however, at fdr <  <dig> , transcription factor activity was enriched in human rh as well. trans regulatory hotspots have been observed in eqtl studies involving yeast  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  and are commonly interpreted as evidence for master regulators. however, unanticipated factors in the data may contribute to false positives. for instance, a high degree of relatedness between mouse strains has produced signatures of regulatory hotspots  <cit>  and association with groups of highly correlated genes has produced unlikely regulatory hotspots  <cit> . integrating additional information such as transcription factor binding sites, protein-protein interaction data and functional analysis is helpful in identifying likely candidates when unanticipated heterogeneity may exist  <cit> .

we found noncoding ceqtls in both human and mouse. debate continues about the importance of the substantial portion of the genome that does not code for genes. while it is clear that much of the genome is actively transcribed, the role of these regions is unclear. we examined new datasets containing genes and functional genomic elements in noncoding regions, yet the vast majority of our noncoding ceqtls cannot be explained by these recent discoveries. we also found no significant overlap of the location of noncoding ceqtl blocks in both species at fdr <  <dig> . at a slightly less stringent fdr <  <dig> , there is significant overlap in the locations of noncoding ceqtl blocks in both species but the regulated genes differ. this may reflect evolutionary divergence. indeed, micrornas, many of which are conserved across species, have also been found to show species-specific regulation  <cit> .

our own search for novel micrornas in noncoding ceqtls yielded no candidates, though it is likely that improved screening techniques and computational algorithms may aid their discovery. also, there were very small numbers of other unconventional rnas such as linc rnas in the noncoding ceqtls. thus, unanticipated forms of gene regulation seem likely. while the rh approach does not reveal possible mechanisms of action, the noncoding ceqtl data could act as a guide for discovery of these novel elements by allowing transfection of overlapping genomic dna fragments traversing the ceqtl combined with transcript profiling as a bioassay.

radiation hybrid panels exist for a number of other organisms including sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit> , cow  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and dog  <cit> . the potential exists for probing species-specific copy number effects on gene expression. amalgamating these data sets can also be used to improve mapping resolution and examine common networks of gene regulation and regulatory regions.

CONCLUSIONS
radiation hybrid panels are a valuable tool for probing the relationship between copy number and gene expression in the mammalian genome in a largely unbiased manner. in both human and mouse radiation hybrid panels, we have mapped to high resolution cis and trans loci capable of affecting gene expression due to copy number change and found a number of consistent results. approximately 30% of genes show an inverse correlation between increased copy number and gene expression and genes on the x chromosome show an attenuated response to copy number increase as compared to autosomes, suggesting a potentially novel form of dosage compensation. copy number perturbations of noncoding regions were shown to affect gene expression as well and the lack of known control elements in these regions may imply novel regulatory loci.
