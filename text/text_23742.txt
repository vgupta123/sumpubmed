BACKGROUND
the function of selective attention is to facilitate the processing of stimuli, selected, for example, on the basis of their modality and location in space. investigations on spatial attention have traditionally focused on selective processing within single sensory modalities. as many objects in everyday life  provide us with information in more than one modality, it appears advantageous to process stimuli in other modalities coming from the attended region of space preferentially, as well. a case in point is the prototypical cocktail-party: in addition to selectively attend to the speaker's voice, it may be of additional value to attend to her/his lip movements. macleod und summerfield  <cit> , for example, have reported increases in intelligibility by  <dig> db. thus, crossmodal synergies are evident and the ventriloquist illusion powerfully illustrates that crossmodal integration is a robust phenomenon that might produce erroneous perceptions  <cit> . a number of behavioural studies  have found evidence for cross-modal links in endogenous  spatial attention between vision, audition, and touch. in these studies, attention was  directed to the expected location of target stimuli within one  modality. on some trials, stimuli of a different  modality were presented, that could appear on the same or on the other side to the expected location in the primary modality. the fact that superior performance was not only found for stimuli at the expected location in the primary modality but also in the secondary modality stimuli, suggests that the focus of attention within one modality influences the processing of information in other modalities. this has also been demonstrated by event-related potentials . erps have the advantage that they can be recorded for stimuli that do not require a response and can thus demonstrate differential processing of secondary modality stimuli as a function of spatial attention in the primary modality. intramodal spatial attention is associated with modality-specific signatures in the event-related brain potential . for example, attention to points in space in the visual modality gives rise to an enhancement of posterior p <dig> and n <dig> components to visual stimuli, with attention effects starting at around  <dig> ms  <cit> . the p <dig> is thought to arise from extrastriate occipital cortex  <cit> , while the n <dig> has a generator in lateral occipito-temporal areas suggesting that the effects of attention on early stages of visual-perceptual processing are mediated by modality specific cortex  <cit> . in the auditory modality spatial attention is associated with an enhanced negativity for attended-location auditory stimuli starting around  <dig> ms and extending for several hundred milliseconds  <cit> . at least the early phase of this negative difference  between the erps to attended and unattended stimuli likely emanates from auditory cortex  <cit> .

because both, auditory and visual attention effects can be linked to modality specific cortex, event-related brain potentials are very well suited to investigate whether the behavioral benefits of crossmodal spatial attention are similarly moderated by early sensory and perceptual processes or whether they arise at later stages.

with regard to the crossmodal interaction of endogenous spatial attention in vision and audition, two different erp approaches can be differentiated. eimer and schröger  <cit>  had participants either respond to visual deviants at attended locations and ignore all auditory stimuli or vice versa. relevant locations were indicated by left- or right-pointing arrows at the beginning of each trial. in other words, transient attention shifts following the cue-stimulus were investigated in this study. when visual stimuli were relevant, enhanced visual p <dig> and n <dig> components were found for stimuli at the attended location. these effects were thus similar to previous intramodal visual attention studies using spatial cues  <cit> . however, when the auditory modality was attended, no modulation of the visual p <dig> amplitude was found. the following n <dig> component, on the other hand, did show a modulation as a function of direction of attention. this finding was viewed as evidence for crossmodal links in spatial attention from audition to vision modulating early stages of visual processing. similar to previous unimodal auditory erp experiments, auditory-spatial attention was reflected in an enhanced negativity for attended-location auditory stimuli in the eimer and schröger  <cit>  study. a similar nd effect was also present in the visual group. this was taken as evidence that visuospatial attention had an effect on early "sensory-specific" auditory processing. as crossmodal links in spatial attention affect sensory-specific erp components arising from uni-modal sensory cortex, this indicates that such links modulate perceptual processes within modality-specific brain areas. in other words, spatial attention not only modulates processing in the primary, attended modality, but also influences modality-specific cortical processing in a currently irrelevant modality.

using a blockwise manipulation of the direction of attention , teder-sälejärvi et al.  <cit> , following earlier work  <cit> , also found evidence for cross-modal effects on early processing stages moderated by sensory specific cortex. in this study, two groups of participants were tested, one only attending to auditory, the other attending exclusively to visual stimuli, thus ruling out a carry-over between experimental conditions. the stimulus series were identical for both groups and contained visual and auditory stimuli coming from left and right locations in fast succession. the visual group showed a typical enhancement of the posterior p <dig> and n <dig> components for attended vs. unattended visual stimuli, while in the auditory group, similar to eimer and schröger  <cit> , no p <dig> modulation was seen. the posterior n <dig> was modulated by crossmodal spatial attention. moreover, a positive shift  was seen for frontal scalp sites for visual stimuli appearing at the location that was relevant for the auditory modality. for auditory stimuli a typical nd effect was observed in the auditory group, which was also seen with the same scalp distribution albeit a smaller amplitude in the visual group.

eimer  <cit>  has interpreted these erp results as evidence for symmetrical crossmodal links in spatial attention between vision and audition. crossmodal spatial attention had an effect on early modality-specific components in the secondary modality, implying that it affects early sensory and perceptual processing stages. however, it cannot be overlooked that modulations of visual erps looked different if attention was directed within vision as compared to within audition. specifically, no modulation of the visual p <dig> component was found if spatial attention was directed to auditory stimuli. furthermore, an attention-dependent frontal positivity was elicited by visual stimuli in the auditory group of the teder-sälejärvi et al.  <cit>  study, which typically is not present in visual attention studies.

the current experiment aimed to replicate and extend previous findings. a design very similar to teder-sälejärvi et al.  <cit>  was employed. instead of leds, video-monitors were used for stimulation to increase signal intensity in order to assess whether the missing modulation of the visual p <dig> in the crossmodal situation could have been due to the relatively low signal intensity in previous studies . furthermore, infrequent visual and auditory novel stimuli  were introduced into the stimulus series in addition to frequent standard and rare deviant stimuli. numerous studies have shown that novel stimuli give rise to different erp responses compared to rare stimuli that repeat within a sequence in the visual  <cit>  and auditory  <cit>  modality. moreover, given the fact that novel stimuli are thought to have an alerting character and serve as a trigger for the orienting response  <cit>  it was of interest to what extent these novel stimuli would be processed outside the spatial attentional focus in the relevant and irrelevant modality.

RESULTS
behavior
reaction times did not differ between visual  and auditory  groups. in addition, intrachannel d'  was computed as a measure of perceptual sensitivity  <cit>  and, again, no difference was found between visual  and auditory  groups. thus, it can be concluded that the difficulty of auditory and visual attention tasks was roughly similar.

visual erps
the erps to the standard stimuli in the attend visual group show typical modulations as a function of spatial attention . at occipital and temporooccipital electrodes, the first attention sensitive component was an enhanced positivity  in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms range. this attention effect showed a contralateral distribution as can be derived from the accompanying topographical maps. it was quantified by a mean amplitude measure  on the posterior temporal and occipital electrodes, which yielded an attention by ipsi/contra interaction effect  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). post-hoc comparisons showed a significant effect for the contralateral  but not for the ipsilateral  electrodes. the next attention sensitive component was an enhanced frontocentral negativity in the 120– <dig> ms time range  for which a main effect of attention  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and an attention x ipsi/contra interaction  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) was seen. this interaction was followed up by post-hoc comparisons which revealed significant attention effects for both, contralateral  and ipsilateral  electrodes.

at more posterior sites, a second, slightly later, negativity  was observed that had a contralateral distribution and was larger for the attended stimuli. this was reflected by a main effect of attention  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) as well as an attention x ipsi/contra interaction  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). post-hoc comparisons revealed an attention effect for both, contralateral  and ipsilateral  electrodes.

for the attend auditory group, a modulation of the visual erps as a function of the direction of auditory spatial attention was evident . no reliable modulation of the p <dig> component was observed. the first attention effect was seen for the posterior n <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , post-hoc comparisons showed an attention effect contralateral, p <  <dig> , but not ipsilateral). this was followed by a more positive peak, which was larger for the visual stimuli appearing at the attended side  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , attention x ipsi/contra f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; post-hoc comparisons showed an attention effect for both, contralateral, p <  <dig> , and ipsilateral, p <  <dig> , sites). at frontal sites, a positive shift was seen for the stimuli occurring on the attended side  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

for the visual novel stimuli a typical attention dependent modulation was observed in the visual group , which included a mainly contralateral enhancement of the posterior p <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; post-hoc comparisons, attention effect at contralateral, p <  <dig> , and ipsilateral, p <  <dig> , electrodes), parietal n <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; post-hoc comparison, attention effect at contalateral sites, only, p <  <dig> ) and frontal n <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , post-hoc comparisons showed attention effect for contralateral, p <  <dig> , and ipsilateral, p <  <dig> , sites).

in the auditory group, novels were similarly associated with a modulation of the posterior p <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; attention x ipsi/contra f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), which is in contrast to the standard stimuli. moreover, an enhancement of a second posterior positive peak was observed  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). at frontal sites, a similar positivity was observed as for the standard stimuli  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

the erps to visual deviants can be derived from figure  <dig>  an n2/p <dig> complex was seen for the attended deviants  in the visual group, which was not present in the auditory group. the p <dig> was quantified by a 400– <dig> ms mean amplitude measure  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; auditory group: n.s.).

auditory erps
in the auditory group a typical modulation of the erp to standard stimuli was seen as a function of the direction of auditory attention . the erp to the attended stimuli was more negative than that to the unattended stimuli. this nd effect was maximal fronto-centrally and was significant in an early  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , attention x ipsi/contra f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and a later time window  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

a similar but smaller modulation was found in the visual group  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; 300– <dig> ms: attention f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

for the auditory novel stimuli , a large frontocentral negativity peaking at  <dig> ms followed by a positive peak at  <dig> ms was observed. this positive deflection represents the p3a component. an attentional modulation of the erp was neither seen in the auditory nor in the visual group. in fact, except for the fact that the p3a was somewhat smaller in the visual group the erps from both groups were very similar. the smaller p3a was corroborated by a between groups anova  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

the attended auditory deviants were associated with an n2b/p <dig> complex in the auditory group, while no p <dig> modulation is present in the visual group . correspondingly, the p <dig>  quantified by a 400– <dig> ms mean amplitude measure  was significant in the auditory group only  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; visual group: n.s.).

discussion
the present study replicates and extends previous results : paying attention to a particular point in space in one modality, visual or auditory, led to modulations of early sensory-specific erp components to stimuli in the other modality. thus, it can be concluded that the processing of unattended modality stimuli occurring at attended locations is facilitated at an early, sensory level.

with regard to visual erps, previous studies using sustained attention tasks similar to one used in the current experiment have not found a modulation of the posterior p <dig> component when attention was directed towards auditory stimuli. the earliest signs of crossmodal spatial attention effects on visual stimuli were obtained only on the subsequent posterior n <dig> component. for the standard stimuli in the present experiment, a similar situation was found, i.e., no enhancement of the visual p <dig> in the auditory group. the p <dig> has been localized to ventro-lateral extrastriate cortex  <cit> , and is the earliest electrophysiological sign of visuo-spatial attention, while the n <dig> component occurs some  <dig> ms later. on the basis of a differential sensitivity to task manipulations it has been suggested that the p <dig> component might index facilitation of early sensory processing for items presented to a location where attention is already focused, while the n <dig> has been proposed to reflect the orienting of attention to a task-relevant stimulus  <cit> .

the question therefore arises whether the p1/n <dig> dissociation found for standard visual stimuli in the auditory group of the present study as well as previous studies  <cit>   indicates that crossmodal spatial attention acts only at later  stages of sensory processing,  reflects the fact that visual stimuli at the attended location lead to an orienting of attention towards these stimuli , or  is simply due to the fact that the visual stimuli used were of insufficient intensity to elicit a p <dig> modulation.

the fact that in the current study visual novel stimuli were associated with a clear attention effect for the p <dig> in the auditory group strongly argues for the latter possibility. please recall, that visual novel stimuli were of created from colored checkerboard patterns. the early  crossmodal spatial attention effect therefore indicates that crossmodal spatial attention acts at the same level in the visual system as intramodal visual spatial attention. why, then, is there an early visual spatial attention effect in the attend visual group for the standard stimuli? previous erp-studies  <cit>  have shown that erps in the unattended modality are generally attenuated . this implies that for standard stimuli in the present as well as in previous studies  <cit>  an p <dig> modulation might have been masked by the "intermodal" effect.

the attention effects for the auditory standard stimuli were very similar in the attend auditory and the attend visual groups: in both cases an nd effect was present, thus replicating earlier studies  <cit> . it can thus be concluded that spatial attention to stimuli in one modality therefore facilitates processing of stimuli in the other modality that occur at the same location at the level of modality-specific cortex in a largely symmetrical fashion: visual attention facilitates the processing of attended location auditory stimuli and vice versa. such facilitated processing is the likely cause of crossmodal perceptual cueing effects  <cit> .

while the present results provide evidence for similarities in the mechanisms of intramodal spatial attention and crossmodal spatial attention on visual stimuli , the modulations of visual stimuli were very different in the visual and auditory groups from  <dig> ms onwards. in particular, the frontal n <dig> effect seen in the visual group was absent in the auditory group. this group rather showed a frontal positivity for the attended location stimuli, which was similar to the "p204" of teder-sälejärvi et al.  <cit> . these authors speculated that this qualitative difference might indicate the participation of additional, polysensory cortical areas in the crossmodal situation. unfortunately, the signal to noise ratio of the current data does not warrant source localization of this effect but scalp-topographic mapping clearly indicates a fronto-central distribution of this effect.

a second aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent the processing of highly deviant rare novel stimuli would depend on spatial attention when the modality of the novel stimuli was relevant or when it was irrelevant. the results were very clear: for novel auditory stimuli, no effects of spatial attention or attended modality were found for the first  <dig> ms post-stimulus, indicating a highly automatic and attention-independent processing of these stimuli. by contrast, the erps to the visual novel stimuli were influenced by the direction of spatial attention. this was not only the case when the visual modality was relevant but also when the auditory stimuli were relevant.

this different treatment of novel stimuli in the two modalities likely results from the fact that spatial location in vision is available automatically by virtue of the retinotopic organization of this system, while location must be actively computed from multiple cues in audition.

CONCLUSIONS
attention to points in space in one modality boosts the neural responses to task-irrelevant stimuli from the same location in another modality. crossmodal spatial attention effects are implemented by modulating the activity in unimodal cortical areas. visual and auditory modalities behave differently with regard to novel stimuli: while the processing of visual novel stimuli requires spatial attention regardless of whether the visual modality is relevant or not, auditory novel stimuli are processed independent of allocation of spatial attention.
