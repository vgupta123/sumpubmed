BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are dispersed repetitive sequences constituting a major fraction of plant genomes, ranging from 10% of arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> , to an estimated value over 70% of maize genome  <cit> . class i elements , transposing via an rna intermediate, form the most abundant fraction, while class ii elements , use a 'cut and paste' mechanism for transposition and are usually less numerous.

advances in genome sequencing of model plant species enabled systematic, computer-based studies towards the identification of repetitive sequences, including those representing putative tes. the presence of certain structural characteristics of particular groups of tes allowed the development of a range of strategies for de novo or homology-based identification of novel elements. a number of methods for automatic mining of transposable elements were developed  <cit> , to date, two model plant genomes, i.e. a. thaliana and oryza sativa  have been extensively studied  <cit> .

founder members of the pif/harbinger superfamily of class ii tes were identified in maize  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> . other full-length elements were subsequently found in rice , carrot, and m. truncatula . autonomous pif/harbinger-like elements carry 14– <dig> bp long terminal inverted repeats  flanked by  <dig> bp long  target site duplications , and a ddd/dde transposase showing similarity to that of the bacterial is <dig> insertion sequence. the group of pif/harbinger-like elements was shown to be widespread in the plant kingdom and composed of two easily distinguishable subgroups, i.e. pif and pong  <cit> . elements representing both subgroups were related to certain miniature inverted repeat elements , like tourist in maize  <cit>  and mping in rice  <cit> .

medicago truncatula  has been chosen as a model plant for the fabaceae family, primarily to study relationships between plants and their symbiotic microbes. it has a relatively small genome of  <dig> to  <dig> mbp  <cit> , shows annual growth habit and self-fertility. the genome of m. truncatula has not been extensively analysed with respect to te identification. a mite element bigfoot was reported in the genomes of m. truncatula and m. sativa  <cit> , a set of ty3/gypsy-like ogre elements characteristic for legume species was described in m. truncatula  <cit> , and several other m. truncatula elements were briefly characterized in repbase update database  <cit> . a recent study of another model legume, lotus japonicus, identified a number of pif- and pong-like elements and a strong evidence for their recent amplification in the host genome  <cit> .

in this paper we used the accumulated m. truncatula genomic sequence data to identify putative tes belonging to the pif/harbinger superfamily and related to a previously characterized mtmaster element  <cit> . therefore, our study was focused on identification and in-depth characterization of a strictly defined group of full-length  tes carrying not only a pif/harbinger-specific transposase, but also a particular tir motif characteristic of most of the pif-like, but not of the pong-like elements.

RESULTS
identification and phylogeny of pif/harbinger-like elements of m. truncatula
the initial search of the m. truncatula genome aimed at the identification of putative autonomous elements, i.e. those carrying an orf showing homology to the predicted mtmaster tpase  protein sequence  <cit>  and flanked with terminal inverted repeats of at least  <dig> bp, containing the g5gtt motif, and followed by a  <dig> bp-long tsd . this resulted to  <dig> sequences showing significant homology  to the tpase, after eliminating the redundancy coming from overlapping bacs. we obtained precisely the same hits using the whole tpase sequence and the dde region, likely because of the very rigorous e-value threshold imposed during the search. of the identified sequences,  <dig> were flanked by tirs and tsds characteristic for pif/harbinger-like elements and these were assumed to represent complete transposable elements. they ranged in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. in  <dig> of these elements, another coding region, similar to the mtmaster orf <dig> with e-value ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig>  could be found. the relative order of both orfs was variable – five elements had orf <dig> upstream and six downstream the tpase .

a phylogenetic analysis of the dde domain region of the tpase revealed that the m. truncatula pif/harbinger-like elements could be divided into five lineages. nine elements, including the previously described mtmaster, were grouped into lineage m, together with carrot dcmaster  <cit> . in seven of these elements the orf <dig> preceded the tpase as expected, while for the remaining two the orf <dig> was absent, most likely because of an internal deletion. eight elements formed a new lineage designated as a <dig>  typically for the group a, the orf <dig> was located downstream the tpase in the five elements carrying both coding regions. another new lineage, designated as e, was formed by two elements. in none of them could the orf <dig> be identified. two other elements were included into lineage a <dig>  together with maize zmpif  <cit>  and one was placed into lineage d . however, in the latter case the orf <dig> was located downstream to tpase, contrary to previously described elements from that lineage  <cit> .

diversity and abundance of pif/harbinger-like elements in m. truncatula
in addition to the tpase-containing elements described above, using a strategy outlined in the methods section, we identified additional  <dig> elements lacking any coding capacity and thus considered as non-autonomous. list of all identified elements and their coordinates are given in the additional file  <dig>  the grouping of the identified transposable elements was based on the full element sequence similarity or 5' and 3' terminal sequence similarity using two approaches: hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling . this strategy allowed us to define families and subfamilies of pif/harbinger-like transposable elements in m. trunactula , where families essentially reflected the lineages previously identified on the basis of the tpase phylogeny, and subfamilies grouped elements carrying homologous tirs  and showing a degree of overall dna sequence similarity. for each but two subfamilies, one or two putatively autonomous core elements could be identified. the exception was a low copy number family mtph-e, for which none of the elements contained a region homologous to the orf <dig> 

the largest family, mtph-a <dig>  contained  <dig> elements, while family mtph-d was represented only by a single element. the second most abundant family, containing  <dig> elements, was mtph-m , of which  <dig> was grouped into subfamily  <dig> 

detailed structure analysis of mtph families
mtph-a <dig> consisted of four subfamilies represented by putative autonomous elements sharing similar orf organization, i.e. a tpase containing two introns, followed by orf <dig>  mtph-a <dig> tpases formed a well supported clade, containing four subclades with high bootstrap values, representing the corresponding subfamilies .

subfamily mtph-a6- <dig> contained nine elements ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, the longest element carrying a nested insertion of the  <dig>  bp long ram <dig> gypsy-like retrotransposon.

subfamily mtph-a6- <dig> grouped six elements,  <dig> to  <dig>  bp long, all being simple internal deletion derivatives of the core element mtph-a6-2-ia.

sixteen elements belonged to subfamily mtph-a6- <dig>  ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, except for a much larger,  <dig>  bp long element mtph-a6-3-iiia, initially identified as being flanked by  <dig> bp tirs unrelated to those of the mtph-a6- <dig> subfamily. however, the element contained a  <dig>  kb region 74% identical to the two elements mentioned above, but lacking the first  <dig> bases in the 5' tir . hence, the true boundaries of the elements could not be initially identified using our mining strategy. an interesting feature of that subfamily was the presence of a perfect microsatellite site in the first intron of the tpase. the three elements containing the region coding for the tpase, mtph-a6-3-ia, mtph-a6-3-iia, and mtph-a6-3-iiia had, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> repeats of the n core motif .

mtph-a6- <dig> subfamily members ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. among the  <dig> members of that subfamily,  <dig> were characterized by the presence of imperfect  <dig> bp long tandem repeats, variable in number, while in the remaining five elements the core repeat was entirely absent. each repeat itself contained a triplicated aaacnncttatt motif. these elements contained from  <dig> to  <dig> repeats that in extreme cases covered almost the entire region between the tirs . in some elements, tandem repeats were present only in one subterminal region, while for the others they were present in both subterminal regions in opposite orientation. the  <dig> bp tandem repeats were identified in  <dig> other sites in the m. truncatula genome, initially not identified as occupied by mtph-a6- <dig> elements. however, blast search with the terminal  <dig> bp +  <dig> bp tsd of the mtph-a6-4-ia and mtph-a6-4-iia elements indicated that in all instances at least one of the regions flanking the repeats showed residual homology to the te terminus . the presence of tandem repeats facilitated internal rearrangements resulting in inversions of the internal region . two nested insertions were identified in the longest element mtph-a6-4-iia, which showed three blocks of significant homology to the mtph-a6-4-ia core element, interrupted by an unidentified element of  <dig>  bp carrying  <dig> bp tirs and flanked by a  <dig> bp long tsd and a gypsy-like retrotransposon .

mtph-m family included three subfamilies with short , similar tirs and orf <dig> followed by tpase. subfamily mtph-m- <dig> contained only four elements, ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. two of them, mtph-m-1-ia  and mtph-m-1-iia  had both orfs, and the remaining two were internally deleted derivatives.

five elements were grouped into subfamily mtph-m- <dig>  three of them carrying both orf <dig> and tpase. the region containing element mtph-m-2-iia occurred to be a composite structure of two related tes. the initially identified sequence flanked by tirs and tsds spanned over  <dig>  bp. the  <dig>  bp element mtph-m-2-iia occupied the 5' region of that sequence, however the downstream sequence also contained blocks of homology to the core element mtph-m-2-ia, and a nested insertion of a gypsy-like retrotransposon . it indicates that an ancient copy of a te related to those belonging to the subfamily mtph-m- <dig> became a target for subsequent nested insertions. other elements from that family ranged in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp.

subfamily mtph-m- <dig> was the largest within the family and contained  <dig> elements, of which two carried both orfs. their length varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, and interestingly, two  <dig> bp-long elements were 100% identical. as their length resembled that of miniature inverted repeat elements , but unlike mites, their number in the m. truncatula genome was low, it would be tempting to speculate that these copies might become founders of a new mite family. a slightly more advanced stage of proliferation of mite-like elements could be observed with a group of  <dig> short  elements from the same family. a more detailed comparison of the element sequences provided a further insight into the evolution of mtph-m- <dig> subfamily. internal deletions were accompanied by differentiation and rearrangement of variant sequences  in the subterminal regions. two lineages could be traced that originated from the core element mtph-m-3-ia, that included respectivley  <dig> and  <dig> elements. the element mtph-m-3-vi showed apparently a mosaic structure, as it contained the 3' subterminal region from lineage i, while the major portion of the element contained sequence variants chracteristic for the lineage ii .

family mtph-a <dig> was represented by four elements ranging in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. the two putative autonomous elements were 72% similar over the entire sequence, but within the coding region the nucleotide sequence similarity reached 95%. two shorter elements were deletion derivatives of full-length elements. interestingly, a recently reported mitrav family of miniature elements of barrel medic  <cit>  showed a high nucleotide sequence similarity of their termini to the mtph-a <dig> elements, spanning over ca.  <dig> bp on both ends of the element.

family mtph-e consisted of three elements, none of which carried both orfs. the elements ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. the two largest elements were very similar, differing by one indel, while the similarity of the shortest element to the other two was restricted only to the  <dig> bp of the 5' terminus and  <dig> bp of the 3' terminus.

family mtph-d was represented by a single element of  <dig>  bp, carrying both orfs. however, their orientation was opposite to that of typical pif/harbinger-like elements representing the d lineage  <cit> . its localization in the d lineage was not strongly supported by bootstrap analysis . the fact that no internally truncated elements were identified could suggest that the element might be capable of perfect excision, not triggering the process of abortive gap repair.

documentation of the mobility of the mined elements
in order to find evidence for a possible mobility of identified elements we implemented a strategy proposed by le et al.  <cit> , i.e. we searched for regions, called resites , paralogous to sequences flanking the insertion sites, but lacking the transposable element. we identified  <dig> resites, of which five represented insertion sites of non-autonomous elements belonging to the mtph-a6- <dig> subfamily, while two and one of them were related to non-autonomous elements of the mtph-a6- <dig> and mtph-a6- <dig> subfamilies, respectively. the remaining three resites represented insertion sites of the putative autonomous  elements belonging to family mtph-e and subfamilies mtph-m- <dig>  and mtph-m- <dig> .

we identified several m. truncatula ests showing high similarity to putative expression products  of the mined autonomous elements . however, ests directly corresponding to the putative expression products, both to the orf <dig>  and the tpase , could be detected only in case of elements representing the mtph-m- <dig> subfamily . interestingly, a number of ests similar to non-coding terminal regions of the tes could also be identified .

the pcr assay of mtph insertion polymorphism was performed on eight m. truncatula populations selected to represent genetic diversity of the species, as proposed by ronfort  <cit> . fifty-six insertion sites identified in the reference genome of cv. jemalong a <dig> were checked for presence of the te. thirty-seven primer pairs yielded products of the expected size for the reference sample, while  <dig> generated complex profiles, likely indicating that insertions were present in repetitive regions. the remaining eight primer pairs produced ambiguous results. of the  <dig> successful amplifications,  <dig> occurred to be polymorphic. usually, the size the shorter amplicon corresponded to the predicted size of the product amplified from the unoccupied site. however, amplicons slightly differing from the expected size were also observed, indicating a possible imperfect excision event .

discussion
we developed a strategy for identification of transposable element families through in silico genome mining, based on initial assumptions on the type of transposase and the consensus sequences of terminal inverted repeats. it required several consecutive steps, i.e.  search for regions coding for the tpase,  identification of tirs flanking the identified regions and matching a defined sequence motif,  identification of related elements with no coding capacity, and  grouping the identified elements into families on the basis of their sequence similarity. we applied this strategy to mine the genome of medicago truncatula for pif/harbinger-like elements similar to the previously described mtmaster element  <cit> . in principle, the proposed strategy can be used to mine for any other type of class ii tes, provided that at least one 'seed' element is known.

diversity of the identified pif/harbinger-like elements is high, although our search was limited by a specifically defined core tir sequence. we focused on  <dig> orfs coding for putative tpases, representing a half of all initially identified orfs, as for the other half, tirs flanking the orf and containing the required motif could not be found. a recent broad analysis of the te landscape in another legume, lotus japonicus  <cit> , revealed a presence of nine putative autonomous pif-like elements  in ca.  <dig> mb portion of the genome. this number is in agrrement with our results, as we found  <dig> full-length elements  in ca.  <dig> mb representing a certain level of redundancy. interestingly, all pif-like tes from l. japonicus represented the a <dig> lineage, while no a <dig> members were identified in m. truncatula, which may indicate a strikingly different evolutionary fate of that group of tes in each of the closely related species.

detailed structure analysis of the mined element families indicates that their proliferation in the genome generally follows the model of abortive gap repair , as proposed for the ac/ds elements in maize  <cit> . members of a particular family were usually direct deletion derivatives of the related, putative autonomous element. however, assuming that members of all pif/harbinger-like te families in the genome of m. truncatula were mobilized with similar frequency, the efficiency of agr seems to vary from one family to another. two families, mtph-a <dig> and mtph-m, were the most numerous, while the remaining three were represented by a very small number of copies. difference in the copy number may be a result of different transposition rates, but it may also indicate that some elements less efficiently trigger the process of agr following excision, which would result in a higher frequency of perfect excision. the latter is further supported by two observations. firstly, the members of subfamily mtph-a6- <dig> contain a variable number of  <dig> bp tandem repeats in one or both subterminal regions, serving as targets for agr and leading to increase of the te copy number accompanied by changes in the number of vntrs. the presence of  <dig> bp tandem repeats was inherently connected with mtph-a6- <dig> elements throughout the m. truncatula genome, which implies that they likely evolved in the course of the proliferation of that subfamily. probably, triggering the agr from the vntr region also led to an inversion of the internal region in mtph-a6-4-xiv, as compared to mtph-a6-4-ia. secondly, at least one member of the low copy number family mtph-e was transpositionally active, as confirmed by the presence of the resite, but despite the potential for mobility, the number of mtph-e elements has remained low.

pif/harbinger-like elements are ancestors of certain groups of miniature transposons , the relation of maize pif element and mites belonging to the tourist family has been well documented  <cit> . also, several other mite families, e.g. heartbreaker from maize  <cit> , kiddo from rice  <cit> , and krak from carrot  <cit>  show tir sequence similarities to those of pif/harbinger-like elements. we were able to directly link the previously identified mitrav mite family  <cit>  to family mtph-a <dig> of m. truncatula pif/harbinger-like elements. this suggests that both mtph-a <dig> and mitrav originated from a recent common ancestor and mtph-a <dig> tpase might be the trans-acting factor for mitrav mobilization, as experimentally proven for the pong and mping mite in rice  <cit> . also, two groups of two and ten tes, all classified in the subfamily mtph-m- <dig>  might represent newly emerging mite families. we performed an initial search for other mites showing a tir homology to the consensus motif of the pif/harbinger tirs leading to an identification of few other mite families . altogether, it confirms that pif/harbinger-like elements and related mites are present in the genome of m. truncatula, similar to genomes of other plant species. however, the number of mite copies is probably much lower than that present in the grass genomes.

a more detailed experimental evaluation of mtph tes diversity in a range of m. truncatula populations should be useful to further characterize the transpositional activity and the dynamics of particular families. analysis of resites and a high incidence of insertion related size polymorphisms shows that a significant fraction of the mined elements was mobile in the recent past. the presence of ests related to orfs of the mtph elements, including those directly derived from the mtph-m- <dig> elements, suggests that they can still be mobile. as proven previously, one transcriptionally active autonomous element can cause trans-mobilization of a range of related, but not directly derived elements  <cit> .

polymorphic insertion sites could be used as a source of molecular markers, as shown previously for other species  <cit> , to measure intraspecific diversity in relation to its geographic structure, complementing other molecular marker systems, e.g. these based on microsatellites  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
starting from a single previously described pif/harbinger-like te of m. truncatula, we identified  <dig> elements representing the diversity of this superfamily in the host plant genome. they were divided into five families representing different evolutionary lineages, and further into subfamilies. elements within each subfamily evolved essentially following the model of agr, leading to the reconstruction of an internally deleted copy in the donor site following transposition. it is likely that different families vary in their potential to trigger the process of agr. one peculiarity observed in a group of elements representing subfamily mtph-a6- <dig> was the presence of  <dig> bp long vntrs in one or both subterminal regions or even spanning over the entire internal region of the te. some of the identified elements are closely related to several mite families, including a previously described mitrav family. also, some of the newly identified short elements can be viewed as in statu nascendi mites, provided that conditions for a rapid burst of their mobility would be met. further investigation is necessary for a more detailed evaluation of the copy number, transpositional activity, and insertional polymorphism of the tes, including mites, as they could be utilized as a source of molecular markers.
