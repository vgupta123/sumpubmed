BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori infections occur in approximately 50% of the human population and are associated with several inflammatory gastroduodenal diseases  <cit> , including two types of gastric cancers: gastric adenocarcinoma  <cit>  and gastric extra-nodal marginal zone b-cell malt  lymphoma, first described by isaacson et al.  <cit> . evolution of this bacterial infection towards malignancy only occurs in approximately 1% of infected individuals, suggesting that both bacterial and host susceptibility factors are involved <cit> .

since the discovery of h. pylori, several studies have focused on elucidating h. pylori pathogenicity mechanisms  that are associated with disease outcomes <cit> . the cag-pathogenicity island  has been recognized as a major pro-inflammatory actor, but its association with malt lymphoma strains has yet to be clearly shown  <cit> . the vaca vacuolating cytotoxin, thought to cause detectable alterations in gastric epithelial cells and immune cells, is also one of the most studied h. pylori virulence factors  <cit> . vaca has also been suggested to play a role in h. pylori persistence, demonstrated by in vitro studies, based on its immunosuppressive properties  <cit> . adhesion of h. pylori to gastric epithelial cells is another bacterial trait contributing to chronic state of the infection. baba  <cit> , saba  <cit> , hopz  <cit> , homb  <cit>  and  <dig> outer-membrane-like paralogs recognized as adhesins or potential adhesins are encoded by the h. pylori genome  <cit> . several studies have highlighted their contribution to pathogen fitness in human populations  <cit> . over the last twenty years, genes encoding these virulence factors have served as genotyping markers to establish correlations between these markers, alone or in combination, and clinical outcomes of h. pylori infections  <cit> .

few studies have been conducted in relation to gastric malt lymphoma-associated strains. koehler et al. reported that the vacam <dig> allele predominated in malt lymphoma-associated isolates  <cit> . in previous studies  <cit>  including an identical collection of h. pylori gastric malt lymphoma strains to that used here, the authors confirmed this finding and suggested that certain combinations of genomic markers may have a predictive value for determining whether gastric malt lymphoma develops. all these data suggest the potential role for bacterial determinism in the clinical outcome of malt lymphoma.

so far, comparative genomics involving sequenced h. pylori genomes have been limited to five clinical isolates isolated in the west and associated with gastritis [strain  <dig>  <cit> , peptic ulcers , atrophic gastritis , or no known disease . gressmann et al. studied gene gain and loss during evolution, by comparing the genome of  <dig> globally representative strains of h. pylori; they reported that 25% of the genes were non-ubiquitous  <cit> . through comparative genomics based on the analysis of  <dig> clinical isolates from various geographical origins  using whole genome dna arrays, we identified  <dig> non-ubiquitous or strain-specific genes  <cit> . in this study, we describe the gene distribution of these  <dig> non-ubiquitous genes  within genomes from a large geographically homogeneous french collection of  <dig> well-characterized h. pylori strains associated with chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, intestinal metaplasia or gastric malt lymphoma. a hierarchical clustering analysis of the dna hybridization values identified a homogeneous phylogenic subpopulation of strains containing all of the cagpai minus malt lymphoma isolates. the b <dig> isolate was selected as a representative of this malt lymphoma-specific cluster. its genome sequence was completed, fully annotated, and compared with previously sequenced and published h. pylori genomes.

RESULTS
non-ubiquitous gene distribution in relation to associated diseases
hybridization results for the  <dig> studied dnas used as a probe and the home-made macroarrays derived from the reference strain  <dig> are presented in additional file  <dig>  and figure  <dig> . both presentations illustrate the distribution of each of the  <dig> genes  with respect to associated diseases. each strain hybridization profile  is represented by a series of vertically aligned bar charts, whereas the horizontal lines represent each of the  <dig> genes. each strain exhibited a unique profile. the most striking features were related to the distribution of the cagpai genes: almost all h. pylori strains associated with metaplasia harbored a complete cagpai, a result consistent with findings by nilsson et al.  <cit> . however, a complete cagpai was present in 70% of duodenal ulcer strains, and in 50% of chronic gastritis and of malt lymphoma strains, confirming previously published findings for isolates collected in the west  <cit> .

hierarchical clustering of the continuous values derived from the hybridization experiments of  <dig> french clinical isolates presenting different disease characteristics was performed . this allowed us to visualize a branch clustering almost exclusively isolates associated with malt lymphoma. furthermore, principal component analysis allowed us to identify a combination of  <dig> genes , which proved to be the most informative during multidimensional analysis. we then performed hierarchical clustering based on the values of these  <dig> genes . two main branches were detected, one consisting of a distinct cluster of  <dig> isolates, all totally deprived of the cagpai. eighteen of the isolates were associated with malt lymphoma and two with gastritis. interestingly, none of the peptic ulcer or metaplasia isolates clustered in this branch. the second branch splits into two main clusters, one corresponding to isolates that totally or partially lack cagpai genes mostly associated with gastritis and the other clustering isolates associated with other diseases.

to clarify the genetic determinism of the malt lymphoma strains, we selected one strain that was representative of the malt lymphoma cagpai minus branch and determined its genome sequence. we selected strain b <dig>  which was isolated from a 62-year-old man suffering from malt lymphoma. it fulfilled various requirements: i) it belonged to the hpeurope phylogenetic branch according to mlst analysis , a property that was consistent with the five helicobacter genome sequences previously published ; ii) it was genetically transformable; iii) it was plasmid free, and iv) it was capable of colonizing the mouse gastric mucosa. its vaca status was s2m <dig>  <cit> .

main features of the b <dig> genome
the genome of the b <dig> strain consists of a circular chromosome containing  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  and an average gc content of  <dig> % . it is the smallest h. pylori genome sequenced to date . the b <dig> genome sequence was first automatically and then manually annotated using the mage system  <cit> http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage and was then compared with the other sequenced h. pylori genomes. it contains  <dig>  cdss with a coding density  similar to that found in the other helicobacter sequenced strains. among the  <dig> cdss,  <dig> were predicted to be protein-coding genes  with an average length of  <dig> bp;  <dig> correspond to partial cdss, of which  <dig> are pseudogenes  and two are remnant genes  .

of the  <dig>  annotated cdss, a function was assigned to  <dig> cdss . for  <dig> of them , a function was experimentally demonstrated either in the helicobacter species  or in another organism . two hundred and five cdss  received a function based on the presence of a conserved amino acid motif, a structural feature, or limited homology. a total of  <dig> cdss have homologs in previously reported sequences of the genus helicobacter , in the epsilon proteobacteria , or in other distant bacteria . protein function classification based on the cluster orthologous genes classification  database allowed us to place  <dig> of the  <dig> cdss  in at least one of the cog functional groups :  <dig> were assigned to cellular processes and signaling systems,  <dig> to information storage and processing, while  <dig> were involved in metabolism. the b <dig> genome exhibits the highest percentage of cdss associated with a cog group , with the number of cdss involved in defense mechanisms slightly higher than in the other sequenced helicobacter strains.

*the cdss were manually curated in the mage system for the elimination of artifacts.

there are a significant number of restriction/modification systems present in h. pylori; their composition and activity have been shown to be strain-specific  <cit> . in the b <dig> strain,  <dig> cdss were involved in restriction/modification systems. among them,  <dig> elements were fragmented into pseudogenes corresponding to  <dig> potential genes, and three elements appeared to be partial genes . thus, the proportion of potentially active genes  appeared to be higher in b <dig> than in strains j <dig> and  <dig>  in which only 30% of type ii r-m systems were reported to be functional  <cit> .

the b <dig> genome harbors five complete copies of the four-gene insertion sequence ishp <dig>  this insertion sequence was frequently found in h. pylori strains from europe, americas, india and africa, but was almost always absent in strains from east asia  <cit> . three of the four genes  demonstrated 100% of identity in the five b <dig> ishp <dig> copies, whereas orfb from one of the five b <dig> ishp <dig> copies  exhibited a single mutation. among the sequenced genomes , a single and complete copy of this element was found in strain hpag <dig>  but it differed slightly from that found in b <dig> . this consistency in the five copies of ishp <dig> in b <dig> indicated that it has been acquired very recently, and that it is probably an active element that is capable of transposition, a property never experimentally demonstrated for a transposable element in h. pylori.

another property associated with the b <dig> genome relates to the complete absence of four of the  <dig> genes encoding outer membrane proteins  from the four conserved omp families  . b <dig> lacks babb, babc, sabb, and homb, four omps known to play a major role in adhesion to gastric epithelial cells and possibly in long-term persistence of strains in the human gastric mucosa when associated with peptic ulcer diseases or gastric metaplasia  <cit> . b <dig> lacks a high number of adhesin genes among the sequenced genomes.

comparative genomics and genome evolution
we then analyzed the genomic rearrangements through pair-wise genomic synteny comparisons between b <dig> and the eight published helicobacteriaceae genomes. for five of the isolates , we confirmed the previously reported relative colinearity of the h.pylori genomes. this colinearity is mainly interrupted by insertion elements, the cagpai, and genes encoding hypothetical proteins  <cit> . however, unexpectedly, conserved synteny highlighted an almost complete colinearity never described so far, between b <dig> and shi <dig> . shi <dig> is a clinical isolate from the gastric antrum of an amerindian resident of a remote amazonian village in peru, and was thought to be related to strains from east asia . this unexpected absence of major genomic rearrangements between the two genomes prompted us to compare the genome of these two isolates more closely, as a way of better understanding h. pylori genome evolution. b <dig> lacks  <dig> shi <dig> genes, of which  <dig> genes cluster in three insertion blocks: one corresponds to the well characterized cagpai; another to a block of  <dig> cdss, mainly remnants from a conjugative plasmid ; and the third corresponds to a block that includes  <dig> cdss encoding hypothetical proteins, as well as one cds encoding an exodeoxyribonuclease subunit which is unique to the shi  <dig> isolate.

conversely, loss of synteny was also due to the presence of  <dig> cdss in b <dig> that were not present in shi <dig>  forty-three of these cdss appeared as clusters within eight loci. twenty corresponded to ishp <dig>   <cit> , which interrupts helpy <dig>  helpy <dig> , helpy <dig> , helpy <dig> , and helpy <dig> . in addition to these five ishp <dig> insertions, loss of synteny was also due to the presence of cdss in four other loci: i) a cluster of seven genes  encoding hacii prophage-like proteins similar to those found in h. acinonychis strain sheeba  <cit> ; however, the size of the prophage is much larger  in this species, suggesting that the prophage in b <dig> has been deleted, possibly following the insertion of one copy of ishp609; ii) a cluster of six genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function ; iii) a cluster of three cdss that are absent in shi <dig>  hpag <dig>  j <dig>  p <dig>  and g <dig>  but present in strain  <dig>  of which two encode alginate-o-acetylation proteins ; iv) a cluster of seven cdss that encode a putative helicase  and a putative serine kinase , two functional proteins not found in all of the other sequenced strains.

h. pylori core genome and strain-specific genes
blast score ratio analyses and comparisons between the b <dig> strain and the six other sequenced genomes, which were analyzed and revised through the mage system , allowed us to establish that the core of the h. pylori genome consists of  <dig>  cdss. this number is slightly higher than that recently published by mcclain and colleagues who identified  <dig>  genes, as it takes into account additional cdss detected by the mage system  <cit> . this number is lower than that calculated from data presented in additional file  <dig>  based on the macroarray hybridization analysis of  <dig> isolates. this approach overestimated the number of ubiquitous cdss, as all small cds  from the  <dig> strain genome were excluded from the analysis, and thus were systematically counted as ubiquitous cdss.

to identify strain-specific genes present in the b <dig> strain but absent from the other sequenced strains, we studied the putative orthologous relationship between two genomes i.e. gene couples who satisfy bi-directional best hit  criteria. criteria included a minimum of 30% sequence identity and 80% of the length of the smallest protein . only  <dig> cdss were found to be unique to the b <dig> strain: nine seemed to be complete and thus putatively functional; six were shown to encode the putative hacii prophage-like proteins ; three were found to encode hypothetical proteins , and seven corresponded to fragments of genes  coding for either conserved hypothetical proteins, prophage-like sequences or for a restriction enzyme. using the same methodology, we looked for genes that were present in the various h. pylori strains and absent in b <dig> . if compared pair-wise, the number of cdss absent in b <dig> was between  <dig> and  <dig>  the only genes that were found to be exclusively absent in b <dig> corresponded to those of the cagpai , the well-known cluster of genes involved in the induction of a strong inflammatory response.

specific properties associated with the genomes of strains belonging to the malt lymphoma pai minus cluster
of the  <dig> strains belonging to the malt lymphoma pai minus cluster, all  <dig> contained the vacam <dig> allele;  <dig> exhibited an s2m <dig> genotype, indicating that they encode a non-functional cytotoxin, and three exhibited an s1m <dig> genotype  <cit> . we then investigated whether the properties found to be unique to strain b <dig> are shared by the strains belonging to the cluster of the malt lymphoma pai-minus cluster. the search for the presence of the hacii-like prophage was done through hybridization using internal fragments of helpy <dig>  helpy <dig>  and helpy <dig> as probes. four of the  <dig> strains  of the malt lymphoma pai minus cluster, contained hacii prophage-like sequences. by contrast, 1/ <dig>  strains isolated from patients with malt lymphoma containing cagpai, 2/ <dig>  strains from patients suffering from gastritis and 2/ <dig> strains  from those with duodenal ulcers contained hacii prophage-like sequences. furthermore, the presence of the two adjacent helpy <dig> and helpy <dig> genes encoding a helicase and a serine kinase, respectively, not previously found in the other sequenced genomes as functional proteins were found in three of the  <dig> strains  of the b <dig> cluster. these two genes were not detected in the other malt lymphoma strains , nor within the  <dig> isolates associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. finally, three clustered conservative mutations in glmm , leading to the absence of amplification of the 294-bp internal fragment of the phosphoglucosamine mutase-encoding gene  <cit> , were observed in five of the  <dig> malt lymphoma pai minus isolates . however, these mutations were not found in any of the  <dig> clinical isolates of this study, nor were they found in more than  <dig> h. pylori isolates associated with gastritis, peptic ulcers or metaplasia that were tested with identical oligonucleotides . these conservative mutations may be indicative of a selective pressure to maintain these mutations, together with a property encoded by a gene present in close proximity to glmm, a property that has yet to be identified. thus, although none of the unique properties of b <dig> were shared by all malt strains of the cluster, characterizing a cagpai minus isolate containing either glmm mutations or helpy0989- <dig> genes may be predictive of malt lymphoma, as these two characteristics were found exclusively among the strains of this cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
the study was initiated with the aim of gaining insight into the existence of bacterial determinism for gastric extra-nodal marginal zone b-cell malt lymphoma. dna hydridization against the whole genome of  <dig> clinical isolates revealed a cluster of  <dig> h. pylori strains, all completely deprived of cagpai sequences originating from patients with malt lymphoma. we sequenced the genome of strain b <dig>  a representative of this cluster, and describe the first genome sequence of a cagpai minus h. pylori strain. the absence of the cagpai, including that of several non-ubiquitous genes, makes the b <dig> genome the smallest h. pylori genome described to date. the cagpai minus b <dig> strain lacks a functional cytotoxin  as well as genes encoding the major adhesion factors ; thus, compared with well-known pro-inflammatory h. pylori isolates, it appears to be deprived of all known pathogenic determinants, but is nonetheless associated with gastric neoplasia. further investigation is required to fully understand the difference in fitness between these strains with low pro-inflammatory profiles and the human host factors that may play a significant role in the development of gastric malt lymphoma.
