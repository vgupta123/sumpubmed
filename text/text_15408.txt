BACKGROUND
all metazoans and many unicellular eukaryotes have functional cilia   <cit> . both motile and immotile cilia  hold many receptors for sensing environmental signals. cilia may offer competitive advantages to ciliated organisms by allowing them to avoid predation and also to track nutritionally rich resources  <cit> . it is thus not surprising that cilia and most ciliary genes are deeply conserved, both in structure and function, in the "tree of life". such high levels of conservation suggest a common evolutionary origin  <cit> . ciliary defects have been associated with defective development in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  as well as a growing list of devastating human genetic disease conditions collectively called ciliopathies, including polycystic kidney disease , bardet-biedl syndrome , alstrome syndrome, joubert syndrome, meckel-gruber syndrome, and primary ciliary dyskinesia  <cit> . in mammals, cilia are found on essentially all cell types, highlighting the critical role cilia play  <cit> . one essential cellular process in cilia is the intraflagellar transport  that is responsible for the assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia. the ift machinery consists of four basic molecular modules:  motors,  complex a,  complex b, and  bbs complex  <cit> .

how ift genes are regulated at the transcriptional level remained largely unknown until this century when swoboda and colleagues discovered in c. elegans that many ift genes are regulated by daf- <dig>  a rfx type transcription factor  <cit> . mutations in daf- <dig> resulted in defects in cilia development and constitutive dauer formation  <cit> . daf- <dig> binds to x-box motif, which is a highly conserved cis-regulatory element first discovered in mammals  <cit> . ciliary genes in c. elegans often contain one or more putative x-box motifs  <dig> bp -  <dig> bp upstream of the coding sequences  <cit> . in addition, ciliary genes and cilia development in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster were also suggested to be regulated by rfx tfs  <cit> . two rfx genes drfx <cit>  and drfx <dig>  <cit>  have been identified in d. melanogaster. drfx was identified through a homology search for the rfx dna binding domain  and drfx <dig> was identified through yeast-one-hybrid  screening for transcription factors that bind to a putative promoter sequence  <cit> . notably, drfx <dig> has not been found in the d. melanogaster genome sequences, suggesting that it is likely located within the heterochromatin regions .

rfx tfs were first identified in mammals as binding proteins of the x-box motif  <cit> . through bioinformatics searches and molecular characterization, seven rfx genes--rfx1- <dig> have been found in mammals  <cit> . different mammalian rfx genes show differential but overlapping expression patterns  <cit> , suggesting that they have complementary and cooperative roles in regulating genes in many different biological pathways. indeed, mammalian rfx tfs have been shown to interact with each other and with many additional co-factors  <cit> . accumulating evidence confirms that rfx genes regulate development and function of cilia in mammals as well. for instance, rfx <dig> knockout in mice led to abnormal cilia development in both brain  <cit>  and pancreas  <cit> .

outside of metazoans, however, there is no evidence suggesting that ift genes are regulated by rfx tfs. no rfx tfs have been reported in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a popular model organism for studying cilia biology. conversely, rfx tfs exist in organisms including the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe that do not have cilia  <cit> , suggesting that rfx tfs do not regulate ciliary genes in these organisms. based on these observations, we hypothesize that ift genes and rfx tfs evolved independently and that their evolution converged at some point. to test this hypothesis, we have identified and examined ift genes and rfx tfs in hundreds of fully sequence genomes that have become available recently.

RESULTS
molecular evolution of ciliary genes
cilia have been observed to exist in many organisms including mammals, fruit flies, and c. elegans. here, we examine the conservation of cilia by examining the ciliary components identified through searches for human orthologs. in total, we have examined the sequenced genomes of  <dig> species ranging from metazoans to fungi and plants. the ciliary components examined here include:  five genes from the motor module ;  four from the complex a module ;  nine from the complex b module ;  six from the bbs complex   <cit>  . we present results from  <dig> representative species in figure  <dig>  most of the ciliary genes examined are strongly conserved in all metazoans ranging from the sea anemone  to human  . the unicellular choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis, which have been regarded as the closest extant relative of the last unicellular ancestor of metazoans  <cit> , also have well conserved ciliary genes. many ciliated protists, including paramecium tetraurelia, tetrahymena thermophila, and phytophthora ramorum have most of the ciliary genes, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . also in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , we have identified conserved ciliary genes in the unicellular algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its closely related multicellular organism volvox carteri. protists giardia lamblia and physarum polycephalum have ciliary features that are similar to cilia development in mammals  <cit> . however, we observe reduced similarity for all ciliary genes in these two species, suggesting that these ciliary genes in protozoa are fast evolving  <cit> . the apicomplexan parasite plasmodium falciparum lacks many ciliary genes, consistent to the idea that the apicomplexan parasites may have an entirely different ciliary assembly mechanism  <cit> . among the  <dig> sequenced fungi, we found only two species, allomyces macrogynus and batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, have conserved ift genes . interestingly, both species lack most components of the bbs complex. these observations are consistent with previous proposal that cilia were lost independently in many fungal species in evolution  <cit> . taken together, our comparative identification and analysis of ift genes suggest that ift genes are deeply conserved and can be found in all metazoans, most unicellular eukaryotes, and some fungi, but they do not exist in plants such as arabidopsis thaliana and prokaryotes  <cit>  .

molecular evolution of rfx tfs
using well defined rfx dbd peptide sequences   from human  <cit> , c. elegans  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit> , and s. cerevisae  <cit>  as queries, we searched the genomes of the same  <dig> species for rfx tfs. because the known rfx dbds in yeast as well as humans show very high similarity, we used very stringent criteria to look for new rfx tfs. we only consider proteins whose putative rfx dbd show at least 40% percentage identity  to the queries . rfx dbd has been shown to contain nine residues that have direct contact with dna sequences   <cit> . all nine residues are highly conserved in all known rfx dbds . therefore we also required that the dbds of candidate rfx tfs contain all of these nine conserved residues.

we found candidate rfx tfs in all sequenced metazoan genomes . in addition to the rfx tfs that have been reported previously, including seven rfx tfs found in mammals  <cit> , daf- <dig> in c. elegans  <cit> , and drfx  <cit> , we found many rfx genes that have not been described previously. we have identified seven rfx genes  in all vertebrate genomes except fish genomes, which have nine putative rfx genes . we have also identified four rfx genes in ciona intesttinalis, six in the purple sea urchin , and five in the sea anemone . in d. melanogaster, in addition to the two rfx genes reported previously--drfx and drfx <dig>  we have identified a novel rfx tf, which we named drfx <dig>  interestingly, among all metazoans examined, nematodes including c. elegans are the only organisms that possess just one rfx gene.

rfx tfs are also found in some non-metazoans. of the  <dig> fungus species examined, we identified single rfx tfs in  <dig> species, including the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, as previously reported  <cit> , as well as a ciliated fungus allomyces macrogynus, whose genome was recently sequenced by the fungal genome initiative of the broad institute http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/fungi/fgi/. all unicellular organisms we have examined possess either one rfx gene  or none except for the choanoflagellates. for example, m. brevicollis, which was recently sequenced  <cit> , contain two genes  with well-defined rfx dbds.

rfx dbd sequences are the defining features of all known rfxs and show high similarity  to each other. however, there are a small number of additional proteins that contain domains that show weaker similarity  to known rfx dbds. in particular, a gene  in the human genome contains a rfx-like domain that shows 29% pid to the human rfx <dig> dbd. among the nine residues that have direct contact with dna sequences, five can be found in the rfx-like domain found in arid <dig>  arid <dig>  whose function as a transcription factor has not been well studied, has orthologs in all mammals as well as other vertebrates . additionally, a gene in m. brevicollis also shows weak similarity  to known rfx dbds . we name this novel gene mbre_crfx <dig>  because of their low similarity to known rfx dbds, these rfx like genes--arid <dig> and mbre_crfx3--are not regarded as rfx tfs in this project and thus are not examined further. no rfx genes have been found in any bacteria, ancient bacteria, or plants .

dbds in the two putative rfx tfs in m. brevicollis are essentially indistinguishable from the dbds in previously characterized rfx tfs with ~70% pid at the peptide level. all nine residues that make direct contacts with x-box motifs are conserved  <cit>  . in addition to the dbds, mbre_crfx <dig> also shares other functional domains within known rfx tfs including the dimerization domains , and the extended dimerization domains , which exist in all mammalian rfx tfs except rfx <dig> and rfx <dig>  <cit>  . aligning mbre_crfx <dig> to human rfx1- <dig> shows clear alignment for conserved dbd, dd, and extended dimerization domains  . none of the m. brevicollis rfx tfs have readily identifiable activation domains . the lack of typical ad in rfx tfs in m. brevicollis, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, and sea anemone  suggests that ad might have been acquired later in metazoan evolution. alternatively, their ads have yet to be identified and characterized. mbre_crfx <dig> has a readily identifiable dbd but lacks other conserved domains, which is similar to the human rfx <dig> and rfx <dig> that lack other domains . the presence of dbd  and other conserved protein domains  suggest that they may function in transcriptional regulation of gene expression in m. brevicollis. however, their target genes remain to be identified.

to further examine the relationship between the m. brevicollis rfx tfs and those identified in mammals and other species, we constructed a phylogenetic tree that contains all known and putative rfx tfs based on the similarity between the dbd domains . sequences outside of the dbds are excluded from analysis since they are often very diverse and are not readily alignable. previous analysis of mammalian rfx tfs revealed three groups: rfx1- <dig>  rfx4-rfx <dig>  and rfx5-rfx <dig> groups  <cit> , which is generally consistent with this phylogenetic tree with newly identified members . the tree shown in figure  <dig> contains an additional clade , which contains rfx tfs identified in fungal genomes and, interestingly, drfx <dig> in d. melanogaster  <cit> . fungus rfx rfs  and rfx5-rfx <dig> tfs show similar domain compositions with all members lacking b, c, and d domains, which are found in the rfx1- <dig> and rfx4-rfx <dig> tfs . the inferred phylogenetic tree clearly shows that the mbre_crfx <dig> fits into the rfx1- <dig> group, while mbre_crfx <dig> fits into the rfx4- <dig> group. mbre_crfx <dig>  which show weaker similarity to known dbds, clusters closer to dbds of the rfx5- <dig> groups. however, as mentioned before, we did not include mbre_crfx <dig> in the phylogenetic tree. the phylogenetic relationship between m. brevicollis and previously identified rfx tfs suggest that these three rfx tfs families were established before the split between choanoflagellates and metazoans.

in the inferred phylogenetic tree, the nematodes are the only metazoans that have only one rfx tf--daf- <dig>  which groups together with the mammalian rfx1- <dig> group . it was proposed previously that prior to the complete sequencing of the c. elegans genome, more rfx tfs should exist in c. elegans  <cit> . however, exhaustive searches of the completed c. elegans genome revealed no traces of additional rfx genes, suggesting that rfx genes corresponding to other rfx groups  were lost in the last common ancestor of the nematode species. in fact, none of the seven sequenced nematode genomes have more than one rfx tf .

evolutionary relationship between ciliary genes and rfx tfs
the above comprehensive identification of ift genes and rfx tfs shows clearly that all metazoans have both ciliary genes and rfx genes. since ift genes have been demonstrated to be regulated by rfx tfs in c. elegans, d. melanogaster, and humans, ift genes in all metazoans are likely regulated by rfx tfs. our analysis strongly suggests that ift genes and rfx tfs evolved independently. in addition to the budding yeast  and fission yeast , we have identified  <dig> fungus species that have single rfx genes but no ift genes, thus rfx genes in these species do not regulate ciliary genes expression. indeed, crt1/rfx in the budding yeast plays a role in dna damage response  <cit> . outside of metazoans, only two sequenced genomes have both ift and rfx genes, the choanoflagellate m. brevicollis and the fungus a. macrogynus. outside of metazoans, choanoflagellates, and fungi, none of the sequenced genomes possess a single rfx gene, regardless of the possession of ift genes.

discussion
this is the first project to comprehensively identify and compare rfx tfs in the entire "tree of life" since emery and colleagues described rfxs in humans , mice , c. elegans, and the budding and fission yeasts domains more than a decade ago  <cit> . in this paper, we identified for the first time  nine rfx genes in all sequenced fish genomes;  two rfx genes in the choanoflagellate m. brevicollis genome;  single rfx genes in many fungus genomes. additionally, we have identified rfx genes in many vertebrates. furthermore, we have identified a third rfx  in the fruit fly d. melanogaster. based on our phylogenetic analysis of all rfx tfs identified in the "tree of life", we have confirmed the hypothesis proposed by emery and colleagues that c. elegans has lost rfx genes as it evolved  <cit> .

more importantly, comparative analysis of the molecular evolution of ift genes and rfx genes revealed a compelling converging relationship between these two gene groups, which is summarized in a model illustrated in figure  <dig>  we propose that the common ancestor of metazoans, choanoflagellates, and fungi was ciliated and had one rfx gene. even though the common ancestor of all fungus species was ciliated and had one rfx gene in some fungus species, including batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, inherited cilia but lost rfx, while other species, including budding yeast and fission yeast, lost their cilia but retained rfx, and some species, including cryptococcus neoformans grubii, lost both cilia and rfx tfs, leaving only a few fungal species, including allomyces macrogynus, that retain both rfx tfs and cilia . in ciliated fungus species, which do not have rfx genes, ciliary genes are likely regulated by factors other than rfx tfs. in contrast, the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates was ciliated and had multiple rfx genes. the plurality of rfx genes was probably due to gene duplication . the expansion of the rfx gene family, in the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates, might have provided a platform for the development of interactions between rfx tfs and ift genes and the establishment of transcriptional regulatory relationships between rfx tfs and ift genes in metazoans. the convergent molecular evolution of ift genes and rfx tfs might have provided a pivotal driving force in the emergence and evolution of metazoans.

the evolution of multicellular metazoans from a unicellular protozoan ancestor represents a major and what we consider to be the most spectacular transition in the "history of life". this transition is demonstrated by the abrupt appearance of a huge variety of metazoans in the fossil record approximately  <dig> million years ago during the cambrian explosion  <cit> . many environmental, ecological, and other evolutionary factors have been proposed to have contributed to this transition  <cit> . great efforts have been made to understand this transition by studying protein-coding regions of numerous genes and gene families that are ubiquitous in and limited to metazoans. findings obtained in these studies showed that many genes and gene families previously found to be expressed only in metazoans are also found in choanoflagellates giving evidence that metazoans arose from choanoflagellates. for example, work by king and colleagues clearly demonstrated that choanoflagellates have a receptor tyrosine kinase that is found in metazoans but not in other eukaryotes  <cit> . manning and colleagues searched the sequenced choanoflagellates m. brevicollis genome  <cit> , and identified a highly elaborate tyrosine kinase signaling network  <cit> . many additional genes are shared by m. brevicollis and metazoans, including cadherin, which are essential for metazoan development  <cit> , and transcription factors such as p <dig> and myc  <cit> . these findings encouraged additional large scale searches, including the unicorn  project  <cit> , for genes and gene families critical for the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. however, accumulating evidence is showing that these genes predated the origin of metazoans and played different roles from their counterparts in metazoans. thus these genes, even though some have been co-opted to perform novel functions in metazoans, are probably not be the main driving force underlying the transition from unicellular protozoans to multicelluar metazoans.

what then was the main factor driving this transition? in contrast to coding sequences of genes, which are usually under strong purifying selection, regulatory sequences show much more rapid evolution. compelling evidence suggests that changes in cis-regulatory sequences and transcriptional regulation in general play a pivotal role in evolution  <cit> . kingsley and colleagues recently identified changes in cis-regulatory modules that dictate dramatic changes in pigmentation in sticklebacks and humans  <cit> . thus the transition from unicellular flagellates to multicellular metazoans may have been driven by innovations at the transcriptional level. the convergent evolution of rfx tfs and ciliary genes  in the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates prompt us to propose that the acquired tight control of ciliary genes at the transcription level by rfx tfs served as one of the critical driving forces in the establishment of multicellularity and the rise of metazoans.

CONCLUSIONS
rfx tfs and ift genes evolved independently in pre-metazoans and their convergence, or the acquired transcriptional regulation of ift genes by rfx tfs, may have played a pivotal role in the establishment of metazoan.
