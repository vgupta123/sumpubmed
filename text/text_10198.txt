BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  strains are an important cause of human and animal diarrhea. in humans, epec are a substantial cause of infant mortality in developing countries. in rabbit production, especially newly weaned animals are highly vulnerable to epec. the attaching and effacing virulence mechanism of epec is encoded by the chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> . after initial adherence, epec translocate their intimin receptor  and other proteins to the eukaryotic host cell by means of an lee encoded type iii secretion apparatus. positioning of tir in the host cell membrane makes the interaction possible with intimin, the outer membrane adhesin encoded by eae  <cit> . this adhesin-receptor binding leads to an intimate contact between the bacterium and the host cell, resulting in the effacement of the microvilli and the formation of actin-rich pedestals beneath the adherent epec  <cit> .

compared to epec in humans  <cit> , only a limited number of bio-/serogroups have been described for rabbit epec . while one bio-/serogroup  is mainly pathogenic to suckling rabbits, other repec are more  or less  pathogenic to weaned rabbits  <cit> . the economic losses in rabbit production are hard to control because many antimicrobial agents cannot be used in rabbits, while at the same time many epec strains are resistant to the drugs commonly used  <cit> .

although much work has been done on unraveling the molecular pathogenesis of epec, it is still not clear which antigens induce protection against an infection. experimental treatment using formalin-killed repec as a vaccine against challenges with e. coli 8+/o <dig> proved to be impractical due to the high vaccination dose and the repeated administrations that were needed. apathogenic e. coli isolates that carried only the colonizing factor of the e. coli 8+/o <dig> bio-/serogroup also turned out to be impractical for use as a repec vaccine  <cit> . recently, an 8+/o <dig> repecΔmutant was shown to protect rabbits against this highly virulent bio-/serogroup  <cit> . epec mutants defective in the intimin encoding eae gene do not induce reorganization of the cytoskeletal structure underneath the site of attachment, and therefore do not form pedestals  <cit> . based on this knowledge, we constructed a repec mutant incapable of reversion to the wild-type due to a disruption of the eae gene. the safety and protective capacity of this mutant for weaned rabbits was examined in detail.

RESULTS
construction of mutant 97/ <dig> Δeae 
only one out of  <dig> colonies tested had lost the  <dig> bp region and generated a pcr band of the expected  <dig> bp, compared to  <dig> bp for the wild-type strain . the deficiency in expression of intimin  was verified by western blotting using sera derived from a repec infected rabbit .

in vitro brush border adhesion assay
the observations with the fluorescence microscope clearly demonstrated that low numbers of 97/ <dig> Δeae bacteria were able to adhere to the brush borders of the isolated rabbit intestinal villi. similarly low numbers of adhering bacteria were observed in the case of the wild-type 97/ <dig>  and 97/ <dig>  strains . the dh5α strain did not adhere to the isolated villi, whereas the b <dig> strain adhered abundantly, as shown in figure  <dig> 

animal experiments
in vivo virulence of mutant 97/ <dig> Δeae
to verify the safety of the mutant strain, one control and three groups of rabbits, which were administered different concentrations of the 97/ <dig> Δeae strain, were examined closely over a period of four weeks.

on arrival, no rabbits were found positive for epec, clostridium spiroforme or rotavirus. eimeria spp. were detected in only small numbers in two rabbits. during the period of the study, no adverse effects due to the baycox treatment were observed. at the end of the study, no symptoms of coccidiosis were noted at necropsy.

during the entire experiment, none of the 97/ <dig> Δeae-inoculated rabbits showed any sign of diarrhea. moreover, no significant differences were observed between the four groups, including the non-infected controls, for any of the parameters examined. mutant strain 97/ <dig> Δeae was isolated from the first day and up to three weeks after inoculation, albeit in low numbers.

vaccination experiment with a homologous challenge after seven days
during an experiment lasting five weeks, the efficacy of vaccination against a homologous challenge as early as  <dig> days post-vaccination was examined in vivo using three groups of rabbits: a vaccinated-challenged group , an unvaccinated-challenged group , and a control group .

no differences were observed between the groups before challenge. after challenge, the group of non-vaccinated but challenged animals  suffered heavily from diarrhea, while no diarrhea was observed in rabbits belonging to the vaccinated group  or to the negative control group . even though the challenge dose was low , one of the non-vaccinated animals died from colibacillosis, as was demonstrated by lesions observed at necropsy and isolation of the challenge strain from the cecal content. non-vaccinated challenged animals systematically showed a lower weight gain compared to vaccinated and negative control animals, although the difference was not significant. the feed intake of the non-vaccinated challenged animals was significantly reduced one week after challenge compared to the negative control  and the vaccinated rabbits . the rabbits recovered slowly in the following weeks and the differences in feed intake disappeared. between the vaccinated and the control group, no significant differences in feed intake were detected at any time during the experiment .

vaccination experiment with a homologous challenge after four weeks
during an experiment that lasted eight weeks, the efficacy of vaccination against a homologous challenge after four weeks was examined in vivo using three groups of rabbits: a vaccinated-challenged group , an unvaccinated-challenged group , and a control group .

before challenge, no apparent differences between the groups were observed. even after challenge with  <dig> cfu of a virulent strain, no differences were observed between the vaccinated group  and the negative control group . however, during the first two weeks after challenge, the animals of the non-vaccinated group  showed clear signs of diarrhea and differed significantly from the vaccinated and control groups for both feed intake  and body weight .

low numbers of the vaccine strain were shed for up to  <dig> weeks after vaccination with a peak at the end of the first week. after challenge, only the wild-type strain was detected, as was verified by pcr. semi-quantitative analysis of the shedding of e. coli showed a clear difference between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups . the non-vaccinated animals shed the wild-type strain in high numbers, whereas the vaccinated rabbits shed the virulent strain in only limited numbers.

vaccination experiment with heterologous challenge after four weeks
at the beginning of a third vaccination-challenge experiment, three groups of weaned rabbits were vaccinated with strain 97/ <dig> Δeae. four weeks later, these and three other groups of rabbits were challenged with heterologous virulent strains and were examined for another four weeks. a seventh group  was included as a negative control. no significant differences were detected between the groups for the observed parameters during the first four weeks. after challenge , the feed intake of the control group differed significantly from all other groups , with the exception of group  <dig>  . the latter group also differed significantly from group  <dig>  as a function of time . no significant differences in feed intake were observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups challenged with other heterologous strains . similar results were observed for weight gain .

after challenge, diarrhea was observed in all groups except for the control group. the diarrhea scores of the two groups infected with a virulent 2+/o <dig> strain were alike. in both groups, two rabbits showed severe signs of diarrhea. the two groups infected with the 8+/o <dig> strain had similar diarrhea scores as well, with three rabbits of the non-vaccinated group  and four rabbits of the vaccinated group  showing severe diarrhea. again, a difference was observed between the groups challenged with the 4+/o <dig> strain. in the non-vaccinated group , five rabbits showed severe diarrhea for more than one week. three of these rabbits died before the end of the experiment. in the vaccinated group , only two rabbits showed mild diarrhea for only three days. in this group, none of the rabbits died.

espb-specific elisa
the concentration of the recombinant espb solution was estimated to be around  <dig>  mg purified protein per ml and was diluted to one μg per ml to coat the microtiter plates. as shown in figure  <dig>  the titers of espb-specific antibodies are significantly higher from day  <dig> onward for the vaccinated compared to the non-vaccinated groups of the second challenge experiment .

discussion
diarrhea caused by repec is a major problem for rabbit production. in this study we constructed an intimin null mutant and tested its protective potential in vaccination-challenge experiments.

the safety of the live attenuated 97/ <dig> Δeae strain was clearly demonstrated, both by the in vivo virulence test and by the three challenge experiments. this is in accordance with the loss of virulence for an intimin null mutant of an attaching and effacing citrobacter rodentium strain  <cit> , but in contrast to a human e2348/69Δeae strain that produced signs of diarrhea in  <dig> out of  <dig> infected volunteers  <cit> . the latter results might be explained by the presence of additional virulence factors in human epec strains, such as a cytolethal distending toxin that has been described for the e2348/ <dig> strain  <cit>  and not for repec so far.

our vaccination-challenge experiments showed that the 97/ <dig> Δeae strain offers complete clinical protection against infection with a homologous 3-/o <dig> virulent repec strain. this was observed whether the challenge took place one or four weeks after vaccination. during both in vivo experiments, the rabbits of the vaccinated groups showed a significantly higher feed intake than those of the non-vaccinated groups. the lack of a significant difference between the weights of the animals during the first challenge experiment was likely due to the lower infection dose. the increase of the dose in the second challenge experiment resulted in more severe clinical signs and a significant difference in weight between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated group. similarly, a 4+/o <dig> c230Δeae mutant had no remaining virulence and was also able to protect rabbits against a later infection with a pathogenic c <dig> wild-type strain . moreover, a recent report showed similar results for an 8+/o <dig> repecΔ mutant which also targets the intimin-tir interaction  <cit> . these three independent results substantiate that attenuated strains with a deletion in the genes responsible for intimate binding are avirulent and can be used to protect rabbits against infection with homologous repec for up to at least four weeks after vaccination. since meat rabbits are normally slaughtered at  <dig> or  <dig> weeks of age, and since they are most susceptible to colibacillosis during the first two weeks after weaning , a single vaccination at weaning may suffice to protect the animals against repec during their entire life span. however, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis since a similar vaccination experiment failed to fully protect individuals against experimental infection with a virulent human epec strain  <dig> days after vaccination  <cit> . together with the decline of the local immune response over time, the high infection dose used during the latter study may have contributed to the results observed.

in an earlier study it was shown that both intimin and a repec adherence locus  were required for the colonization of a 3-/o <dig> repec strain  <cit> . these results are in agreement with our in vitro adhesion studies and shedding data. apparently, the mutant strain is able to adhere and persist in the intestine for over three weeks, albeit in low numbers. this persistence of the mutant strain was sufficient to elicit a specific immune response, as was shown by an espb specific elisa, and to protect the animals against colonization by a homologous pathogenic strain. conversely, only partial protection – if any – was observed when the rabbits were challenged with heterologous repec strains. the 3-/o <dig> mutant was largely protective against a challenge with a virulent 4+/o <dig> strain, but failed to protect rabbits against the virulent 8+/o <dig> and 2+/o <dig> strains.

it is unlikely that the lack of cross-protection between repec types is the result of different subtypes of lee encoded proteins. different subtypes of lee-related proteins have been described for a number of hosts  <cit> , but whether this is also the case for rabbits and whether these subtypes may influence protection is questionable. also whether or not the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides elicit a protective immune response remains to be elucidated. many cross-reactions between polysaccharides have been described  <cit> , but to our knowledge, no data are available about cross-reactivity between the serogroups studied  <cit> . experiments in chickens with fimbrial antigens and lipopolysaccharides as potential vaccine candidates showed promising results  <cit> . however, a subsequent study by the same research unit  <cit>  also showed a lack of protection against a heterologous challenge.

colonization factors, possibly related to certain serogroups, may also explain our observed results. several fimbriae have already been determined to enhance pathogenicity  <cit> , but the relation of colonization factors to bio-/serogroup needs further study. so far, the expression of af/r <dig> has only been described in 8+/o <dig> strains  <cit> , while a ral encoded adhesin has been described for a 3-/o <dig> strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments indicate that an eae deletion mutant may prove to be an effective, practical and safe vaccine candidate for protection against homologous challenges, but it cannot completely protect against heterologous virulent repec strains. our study may also be helpful in the process of understanding the pathogenesis of epec in humans. the extensive genome and protein conservation between rabbits and primates  <cit>  and the fact that repec pathogenesis shows more similarities with human epec infections  <cit>  than do the commonly used c.rodentium infections in mice, make the rabbit an interesting animal model. further studies using deletion mutants targeting other antigens may help to elucidate which factors are protective. in the mean time, the use of a combination vaccine consisting of the main repec bio-/serogroups may prove an effective tool in the control of colibacillosis in rabbits.
