BACKGROUND
in general, eating fruit is strongly recommended to improve health, but this can cause an allergic reaction in certain individuals. most fruit crops in temperate and some subtropical zones belong to the rosaceae family, mainly the subfamilies maloideae and prunoideae. fruits from the maloideae, like apple  <cit>  and pear  <cit> , and prunoideae such as peach  <cit> , sweet cherry  <cit> , plum  <cit> , apricot  <cit>  and almond  <cit>  have been reported to cause allergic reactions in europe. the annual peach production in china has been around  <dig> million tons in recent years, and has lead to both an increase in peach consumption and more prevalent fruit allergy.

it is considered that general avoidance of fruit has a negative effect on health in allergic patients and also affects their quality of life. therefore, the low allergic property of fruit is worth considering in new peach breeding programs. as cultivars of the same species differ in allergenicity  <cit> , the selection and breeding of new, low-allergenic cultivars is becoming feasible by a multidisciplinary approach, such as in the eu-safe project  <cit> , where doctors and plant geneticists identified the apple cultivar 'santana' as low allergenic in the majority of dutch patients with a history of allergy to apple  <cit> . a similar approach was initiated in peach in recent years through collaboration between china and europe.

a variety of allergens from different fruits have been identified by means of experimental immunology and molecular biology, in particular by protein and gene identification and sequencing <cit> . from the structural and biochemical point of view, fruit allergens identified belong to a limited number of protein families  <cit> . in the case of rosaceae, the majority of allergens present in fresh fruit belong to four families: pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> , thaumatin-like proteins , non-specific lipid transfer proteins  and profilins   <cit> . whole, unprocessed fruit containing pr- <dig> protein elicit allergy, while tlp, ltp and profilins are stable proteins because of intra-molecular disulfide bonds. these four allergen families in prunus fruits are already on the international allergen list . in peach they are denoted as pru p  <dig> , pru p  <dig> , pru p  <dig> , and pru p  <dig> , and in almond as pru du  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. due to the common structure and properties of each protein family over a wide range of plant species, genera and even families, allergy cross-reactivity has been frequently observed, for example between pru p  <dig> and mal d  <dig> proteins from peach and apple respectively with bet v  <dig> proteins in birch pollen  <cit> . peach allergy occurs more often in southern europe, and two different peach allergy profiles have been observed in spain. one of these is the oral allergy syndrome  caused by pru p <dig> and pru p  <dig>  the other is the systemic gastrointestinal symptom caused by pru p  <dig>  <cit> . in china both profiles have also been reported after eating fresh peach  <cit> . in addition, some contact with peach fruit hair or even with pollen during the blooming season caused adverse reactions .

genomic characterization of the sequences and linkage map positions of the four apple allergen gene families were reported in  <dig>  <cit> , and subsequent associations between the genetic constitution and allergenicity of different cultivars gave the first indications on the isoallergens  and protein variants  involved in low and high allergenic responses   <cit> . comparison between apple  and prunus linkage maps suggests a high level of synteny of the linkage groups between these two genera  <cit> . for prunus g <dig>  the upper part contains several rflp markers that aligned with apple lg <dig> and lg <dig> on which the majority of mal d  <dig> genes are located, and the lower part aligned with lg <dig>  where mal d  <dig> a is located. prunus g <dig> aligns with apple lg <dig> where apple mal d  <dig> a/b and mal d  <dig>  were mapped. therefore, some of the homologous allergen genes of prunus fruit may be located at syntenic positions as compared with the apple genome.

in peach, differences in major allergen pru p  <dig>  and pru p  <dig>  content among cultivars have been reported in recent years  <cit> , which encouraged us to conduct research similar to that done in apple  <cit> . advances in three aspects make the genomic research of prunus allergen genes possible. first, a set of candidate genes is now available based on previous medical and molecular biology research  <cit> . second, a large number of peach fruit ests are available in databases , allowing us to find different members of the four putative allergen gene families. third, a highly saturated genetic prunus reference map t × e  and a simple bin-mapping strategy  <cit>  provides an efficient and reliable way to map new genes.

pru p/du  <dig>  genes
according to four pru p  <dig> cdna reference sequences derived from peach fruit in the genbank database, we obtained  <dig> different pr- <dig> dna sequences  from mb1- <dig> by pcr cloning, and classified them into eight distinct gene members based on their dna sequence identity less than 98%, of which four were new   and formed a new group distinct from the initial reference sequence  . all pru p/du  <dig> genes had a single intron with variable size,  and two exons of  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt each, except in the second exon in pru p/du  <dig>  that was  <dig> nt long. alleles derived from almond cv 'texas' and peach cv 'earlygold' had different intron sizes in four pru p/du  <dig> members , used to map these genes in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . dna sequence divergence between allele from peach and almond is very low . amino acid  sequences from these genes were deduced from their coding dna sequences . most pru p/du  <dig> had  <dig> aa, except for pru p/du  <dig>  with 159aa, with the common feature of a p-loop . overall aa sequence identity among different isoallergen was  <dig> %– <dig> %, and three pru p  <dig>  members  have about 98% aa sequence identity . segments of identical aa sequence were found in several locations, especially surrounding the p-loop. pru p/du  <dig>  had a proline  residue in the p-loop, which is similar to mal d  <dig>  and  <dig> and all bet v  <dig>  while the other pru p/du  <dig> isoallergens had a valine  in this position. the predicted protein molecular weights were in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  kda, and pi values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . comparing the aa composition between alleles from peach and almond of each gene in figure  <dig>  we found that there was only one difference for pru p/du  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 06b, while pru p/du  <dig>  and pru p/du  <dig> a differed by  <dig> and  <dig> aa, respectively. a phylogenetic tree of the deduced amino acids from peach cv. 'earlygold' alleles and those in apple   showed that at least one pru p  <dig> isoallergen member is present in each of the four subfamilies of apple mal d  <dig> genes  identified in a previous study  <cit> . furthermore, we can see in the subfamily iii branch that pru p  <dig>  and three highly similar pru p  <dig>  members  clustered with three mal d  <dig>  members , while pru- <dig>  clustered together with mal d  <dig> , one of the apple intronless genes in subfamily iv. all eight pru p/du  <dig> genes mapped to bin 1: <dig>  at the top of g <dig> .

pru p/du  <dig> 
analysis of the peach tlp sequences in the ncbi identified four members of this gene family at the start. a single primer pair based on  resulted in four very similar sequences assigned as two separate genes  with minor intron size differences. genome walking to upstream was employed in pru p/du  <dig>  to search for more polymorphisms and downstream to pru p/du  <dig> , since its initial reference sequence was partial. five members of prunus tlps were identified after analysis of the genomic sequences : pru p/du  <dig> a and -01b, pru p/du  <dig> , - <dig> and - <dig> , of which pru p/du  <dig> b is new. the pru p/du  <dig> members had distinct genomic structure . three of them had one intron separating a short  and long  exon, while one member  had two introns. comparing the deduced precursor of prunus tlps with the reference tlp amino acid sequences in the rosaceae and other plants, we assigned the putative signal peptides to deduce the mature protein . pru p/du  <dig>  had a shorter signal peptide,  <dig> aa in peach and  <dig> aa in almond, while the other four members had a  <dig> aa signal peptide. they differed considerably in protein size, with pru p/du  <dig>  and pru p/du  <dig>  having longer peptides in the c-terminal than pru p/du  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acid sequences identity from alleles from peach and almond for five pru p/du  <dig> members are different, they are  <dig> % for pru p/du  <dig> , about 96% for pru p/du  <dig> a and -01b, 98% for pru p/du  <dig> , and  <dig> % for pru p  <dig>  p/du  <dig> .

based on the percentage amino acid identity among five pru p  <dig> isoallergens, pru p  <dig> a, 01b and  <dig>  were clustered with four apple mal d  <dig>   proteins. pru p  <dig> a and  <dig> b had  <dig> % identity in their aa sequence, their closest homologous members being apple mal d  <dig> a and b. pru p  <dig>  and  <dig>  are quite distant from  <dig>  and  <dig>   and no close counterparts were found in apple. the overall sequence identity level in amino acids among the four pru p  <dig> proteins was around 40% , but a long sequence region  around position  <dig>  and the typical  <dig> cysteine  to form  <dig> disulfide bonds, were conserved in all pru p/du  <dig> members. mature pru p  <dig> a,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were acidic , whereas pru p  <dig> b and  <dig> were basic . mature pru p  <dig>  and  <dig> had a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda. mature pru p  <dig>  differed in length and weight with mature pru du  <dig> , with the molecular weight being  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively. mature pru  <dig>  had the highest number of aa  with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. unlike the pru p  <dig> genes that were placed in a single bin, these five pru p/du  <dig> members mapped on four linkage groups: pru p/du  <dig>  a and b on g <dig>  - <dig>  on g <dig>  - <dig>  on g <dig>  and - <dig>  on g <dig> .

pru p/du  <dig> 
four peach and almond nsltp members were traced from the ncbi dna database, three of them have complete coding sequences, the fourth  is a partial almond cdna sequence distant from the other three. genomic cloning and sequencing was done with the first three members pru p/du  <dig> - <dig> . pru p/du  <dig> gene sequences have two exons and one intron . the size of the second exon was conserved and extremely short , while the first was variable . sequences from peach and almond ltps are highly conserved in exon and intron size, with only one base pair length difference in introns of pru p/du  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

the deduced pre-mature pru p  <dig> proteins had different signal peptide lengths of  <dig> aa,  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa for pru p/du  <dig> – <dig>  respectively . in peach and almond , pru p/du  <dig>  alleles had identical signal amino acids, but their mature proteins differed in  <dig> aa, of which  <dig> are at the c-terminal end. pru p/du  <dig>  had identical aa, and pru p/du  <dig> , only one amino acid difference p/t at position  <dig>  the three prunus ltps isoallergens differed greatly in their signal peptide region, with about 40–80% sequence identity , their alignments were according to the eight conserved cysteine residues . all mature pru p/du  <dig> were alkaline  and their molecular weight was around  <dig> kda. pru p  <dig>  grouped closely with apple mal d  <dig>  and  <dig> , and pru p  <dig>  with the putative mal d  <dig>  . pru p  <dig>  is distant from pru p  <dig>  and - <dig>  and shares about 50% aa identity with the others. interestingly, all three pru p  <dig> genes mapped on bin 6: <dig> . one of them, pru p  <dig>  , had previously been mapped using the whole txe population and was located at  <dig>  cm from the top of g <dig>  <cit> .

pru p/du  <dig> 
genomic sequences for two profilin genes pru p/du  <dig>  and pru p/du  <dig>  were obtained based on their cdna data . both genes have three exons with conserved length,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt, in agreement with that found in most plant species. dna polymorphisms in pru p/du  <dig>  occurred mainly in the first intron, but in pru p/du  <dig>  they were in the first and second exon. these two genes gave the same protein sequences for peach and almond , although a few synonymous polymorphisms existed at the gdna level. molecular weights were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda for pru p  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and both were acidic . compared with the six known mal d  <dig> isoallergens, pru p  <dig>  was similar to mal d  <dig> a and b , while pru p  <dig>  was similar to mal d  <dig> a and b  . pru p  <dig>  was mapped on g <dig> and pru p  <dig>  on g <dig> .

discussion
this study provides basic genomic sequences and map positions of four allergen families in prunus persica  and prunus dulcis . this information is a prerequisite for unravelling the genetic basis of allergenic characteristics of prunus fruits, and is likely to be similar for other prunus species due to the high level of synteny of the species within this genus  <cit> .

gene families and relevance of individual genes in allergenicity
gene family is becoming a prevailing topic in genomic research. it is thought that the pressure to conserve protein sequence and structure is associated with an increase in copy number of certain genes during evolution  <cit> . although food allergens belong to a limited number of protein families  <cit> , each protein family in a single species can be putatively encoded  by multiple genes in specific tissues, thus making the in vivo allergic reaction very complex. there is a need to identify genes implicated in the allergic reaction from the many putative allergen genes existing. searching the updated arabidopsis thaliana dna sequence database, we found  <dig> putative pru p 1-homologous genes scattered over the five chromosomes . more than half of these  are located on chromosome  <dig> in four clusters, each with  <dig> to  <dig> genes. nineteen tlp genes are present on four chromosomes. ltp genes form a large gene family with  <dig> members, more or less equally distributed over all five chromosomes, and profilin is a small gene family with  <dig> members mapping to three chromosomes. it is probable that, in peach and apple, only a small fraction of pr- <dig>  tlp and ltp gene members are relevant to allergenic trait.

a limited number of putative allergen genes may be expressed in consumed fruits, their expression profiles at mrna and protein level are essential to allergenicity. evidence of cdna present in the ripe fruit is not sufficient. the need to qualify and quantify their individual or combined allergenicity is a major challenge for further investigation, where the application of new experimental and computational tools in genomics and proteomics will be crucial. results in this area are starting to emerge and integrate, such as differential expression of ltp  <dig>  and ltp <dig>   <cit> , the expression studies of pru p  <dig>   by the mimotope mapping technique. of four pru p  <dig> isoallergen genes, a clone ppaz <dig>  matching to pru p  <dig>  was abundantly expressed in ripe peach fruit, while clone ppaz <dig>   was undetected by northern blot analysis  <cit> . pru p  <dig>  and pru  <dig>  were identified from the fruit ests, the latter may be in large amount of transcript, since  <dig> ests can be assembled into one consensus gene. a very low level of pru p  <dig>  was has been identified as pollen-associated allergen, and two isoallergen genes were isolated from fruit tissue  <cit> . different pru p  <dig> genes expression was not reported previously, our preliminary expression study was performed by means of real-time pcr for six pru p  <dig> isoallergen genes on full ripe fruits of two cultivars. the result showed that the most abundantly expressed member is pru p  <dig> , followed by pru p  <dig> , then very low expression level for pru p  <dig>  and - <dig> , while pru p  <dig>  and - <dig> were hardly detected .

in apple, a very recent comprehensive gene expression of four classes of putative allergens in apple fruit has gained insight of the genetic and environmental factors affecting the allergenic potential of apples  <cit> . they showed that some putative members are statistically different in transcript accumulation in ripe fruit, while others were not detectable. this was a very nice reference to think about comparative transcription and protein expression for all set of peach putative allergen genes among diverse peach cultivars.

we found that the putative genes encoding the major allergens reported in peach fruit, pru p  <dig> and pru p  <dig>  <cit> , were located on two linkage groups, g <dig> and g <dig>  based on their bin map positions, we can use ssr markers tightly linked or flanking these two major prunus allergen genes for a diversity survey of a large number of genotypes to search for potential candidates for further sequencing of the allergen genes. clinical evaluation of allergenicity for different peach cultivars is needed for association analysis to find low allergenic alleles.

comparative mapping between prunus and malus using the sequence and position of allergen genes
dirlewanger et al.  <cit>  compared the prunus and apple genomes using a limited number of common markers. they found that three prunus linkage groups  were syntenic to seven apple linkage groups, g <dig> to lg <dig> and lg <dig> at the top and lg <dig> at the bottom, g <dig> to lg <dig> and lg <dig>  and g <dig> to lg <dig> and lg <dig>  information is also available on the correspondence between homoeologous linkage groups within the apple genome obtained initially with rflps by maliepaard et al.  <cit> , to which various allergen genes and ssrs were recently added by gao et al.  <cit>  and celton et al.  <cit> , respectively. with the availability of genomic sequences and the linkage map positions of the four allergen-families in apple   <cit>  and peach , we have additional information useful for updating the synteny between these two species.

three of the eight prunus bins where we located putative allergen genes corresponded to known syntenic and colinear regions of the apple genome : the pru p/du  <dig> on g <dig>  corresponding to regions with clusters of homologous genes  of apple on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  pru p/du  <dig>  on the lower part of g <dig> and mal d  <dig>  on lg <dig>  and pru p/du  <dig> a/b on g <dig> and mal d  <dig> a/b on lg <dig>  three more syntenic regions were detected in this study: pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> and the region of lg <dig> where mal d  <dig>  maps, pru p/du  <dig> - <dig> on g <dig> corresponding to mal d  <dig>  on lg <dig> and mal d  <dig>  on lg4; and pru p/du  <dig>  which, in addition to the region of lg <dig> already mentioned, is syntenic with the upper part of lg <dig> where mal d  <dig> b maps. no counterparts were found to the pru p/du  <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig> genes, which were mapped on g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively, on the apple genome. the positions of these three genes in the prunus genome indicate syntenic regions of apple where additional mal d  <dig> genes may be located. because mal d  <dig> on apple lg  <dig> and lg <dig> are clustered in a region of about  <dig> cm, so we can deduce our mapped pru p  <dig> genes are also in a cluster.

there are two hypotheses on the origin of the two genomes that generated the apple amphydiploid genome . one proposes that these were from members of two rosaceae subfamilies, one from the amygdaloideae  and another from the spiraeoideae   <cit> . the other hypothesis proposes that both ancestral genomes had a basic chromosome number of x =  <dig> at least one being spiraeoideae   <cit> . combining map position and sequence comparison, the cluster of pru p  <dig> genes mapped on prunus g <dig> is more similar to that of the mal d  <dig> genes of lg <dig> than to lg13: a) mal d  <dig> isoallergen genes were classified into four subfamilies and members of sub-families were distributed asymmetrically to lg  <dig> and lg <dig> , i.e. lg <dig> contains mal d  <dig> members from subfamilies i and iv, but lg <dig> contains representative members of the four subfamilies; b) pru p  <dig> genes fall into the four subfamilies as defined in apple, and had a higher deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the mal d  <dig> members on lg <dig> . these results favor the two primitive genomes for apple and one is closer to prunus than the other.

bin mapping feasibility and effectiveness
the bin mapping approach provides a fast and cheap way to map new genes  <cit>  that has worked very well in our hands. once we cloned and sequenced the two putative alleles for each gene from mb1- <dig>  we either created an allele-specific marker and genotyped the eight plants of the bin set, or cloned the fragments from the individuals of the bin set and sequenced them to determine their genotypes. one of the advantages of using the t × e population for bin mapping is that, due to its inter-specific nature, polymorphism is very high  <cit> . the disadvantage of the bin mapping approach is that there is a loss of precision in marker location , but this can be solved for markers of particular interest by running the whole population to establish a more precise position or narrow down a region where closely related genes or common rflp markers in apple has been fine mapped. for example, we estimate pru p/du  <dig> genes  are in a cluster and likely around  <dig> cm from the top based on location of mal d  <dig> genes and anchor marker mc <dig> . a very large number of ests from peach fruit are on public databases. this information is essential to find candidate genes to be mapped, and their positions compared to that of major genes or quantitative trait loci of interest mapped using phenotypic data. bin mapping, as in this case, can facilitate the positioning of these candidate genes. exchange of dna and genotype data of the t × e bin set in the peach research community is helping candidate gene mapping, with genetic analysis and breeding applications following on.

CONCLUSIONS
eighteen putative prunus allergen genes were located on five of the eight linkage groups of this genus. genomic characterization of prunus allergens provided further evidence for synteny between prunus and malus. this information will be directed towards identifying the key genes or isoforms causing the differences in allergenicity among different cultivars by additional gene and protein expression and genetic association studies. these results are a first step towards the understanding of allergenicity caused by peach fruit and for the development of new cultivars with enhanced health properties and subject to specific recommendations on fruit consumption.
