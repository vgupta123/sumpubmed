BACKGROUND
sinorhizobium meliloti is a micro-symbiont associated with legume plants. this soil bacterium inhabits nodules on the roots of host legume plants, where it reduces atmospheric nitrogen to organic nitrogenous compounds that can be utilized by its hosts. because of its agricultural and ecological importance, s. meliloti has been extensively studied as a model symbiont. the s. meliloti  <dig> genome sequence and the initial annotation of the genome were completed in  <dig>  <cit> . the s.meliloti genome comprises three replicons, the  <dig>  mb chromosome, the  <dig>  mb megaplasmid psyma, and the <dig>  mb megaplasmid psymb  <cit> . according to refseq  <cit> , the s. meliloti  <dig> genome has  <dig> predicted protein-encoding genes. among these, more than one-third were annotated as "hypothetical" or "unknown". many research papers have been published on s. meliloti since its genome sequence was completed. also, more genomes of closely related species such as brucella spp., rhodopseudomonas palustris, and s. medicae wsm <dig> have been sequenced. comparative genomics including newly sequenced genomes provides new information about the genome of s. meliloti. there is an ongoing need to update and improve its genome annotation. so far, there are no systematic efforts of direct sequencing of its entire transcriptome. microarray data are available, but most microarray designs are based on annotated genes  <cit> . high-density whole-genome tiling arrays are not yet available.

the goal of this study was to develop a high-throughput experimental approach to search for new genes of s. meliloti missed in the previous genome annotation  <cit> . we used pyrosequencing  <cit>  to sequence the transcriptome of s.meliloti. the gs flx system from roche and  <dig> life sciences can generate more than  <dig> million bases per sequencing run with an average yield of greater than  <dig>  reads of average length of  <dig> bases. this platform provides a broad range of applications including whole genome sequencing  <cit> , transcriptome and gene regulation studies  <cit> , metagenomics analysis  <cit>  and amplicon sequencing  <cit> . although pyrosequencing has been used to sequence microbial genomes, relatively few applications of transcriptome analysis have been reported. here, we present the first report of sequencing a bacterial transcriptome using the gs flx platform as an experimental approach for gene discovery.

RESULTS
gene prediction
we used an automated gene annotation pipeline provided by patric  <cit>  to predict genes in s. meliloti. this pipeline uses a combination of gene prediction programs, glimmer  <cit> , genemark  <cit> , tico  <cit>  and rbsfinder  <cit>  to predict genes and compares with genes in refseq. a total of  <dig> new protein-coding genes  in the intergenic regions of the genome were predicted through this automated pipeline . the number of predicted genes in different length ranges is shown in figure  <dig>  most of the predicted new genes are relatively small . the average length is about  <dig> nt. these genes were blasted against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database  <cit> . the result showed that  <dig> candidates had blast hits in the nr database with e-values less than  <dig> , whereas the remaining  <dig> of the candidates had no significant hits. small gene size and lack of blast hits may be the reasons that the predicted new gene candidates were missed in the original genome annotation process.

sequence analysis
total rnas were extracted from s. meliloti  <dig> cells grown to mid-exponential phase in the ty medium and treated with dnase i to remove genomic dna . the 16s and 23s rrnas were depleted and the rna samples were then amplified to produce cdna fragments of average length about  <dig> nt . with two test cdna samples loaded on to  <dig> lanes per sample of a  <dig> lane sequencing plate, the titration run generated a total of  <dig>  high quality reads with average length of  <dig> nt . although our rrna removal step indicated that more than 90% rrnas were depleted as judged by agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, approximately 90% of the reads still aligned to the rrna operons . this may be due to relative low mrna population in the s. meliloti cells. out of  <dig> reads aligned to the rrna operons,  <dig> reads matched 5s rrna,  <dig> reads matched 16s rrna,  <dig> reads matched 23s rrna, and the remaining  <dig> reads aligned to the integenic regions between the rrna genes in the rrna operons. for the  <dig> non-rrna sequences,  <dig> matched to  <dig> of the  <dig> refseq genes  and  <dig> matched to  <dig> of  <dig> new protein-coding genes predicted through our gene prediction pipeline. the remaining  <dig> sequences mainly matched sequences either immediately before or after a coding region, presumably 5' utr or 3' utr.

validation of new genes using rt-pcr
twenty new gene candidates with multiple gs flx sequence hits or long sequence hits  were chosen for further verification using rt-pcr analysis of the original total rna samples. these new gene candidates were predicted by patric pipeline as protein-coding genes. figure  <dig> shows an example of a new gene candidate  in the sinorhizobium genome browser, which was built using the gbrowse software  <cit> . all  <dig> genes were detected in the rt-pcr experiment and the pcr products were sequenced and confirmed . the negative controls indicated that there was no genomic dna contamination in the rna samples tested.

to test whether the new genes are co-transcribed with their upstream or downstream flanking genes , a set of primer pairs were designed  to detect rt-pcr product of the transcripts with the flanking genes. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  columns "co-transcribed with upstream gene" and "co-transcribed with downstream gene" indicated whether the rt-pcr products of the transcripts, which span from the upstream flanking gene to the new gene or from the new gene to downstream flanking gene, were detected. ten of the predicted genes were not detected to be co-transcribed with either upstream or downstream flanking genes .

functional annotation of the new genes
the sequences of putative new genes were searched against the nr database from ncbi and swissprot from ebi  <cit>  using blastx  <cit>  and smith-waterman programs . both programs produced very similar results:  <dig> of the  <dig> new genes had no significant hits, and the other  <dig> had either a full length or partial match with proteins in the nr database . the genes with no significant hits were relatively short with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt.

four predicted genes showed significant matches with genes with known or putative functions . vbismc <dig> had 89% similarity to a conserved hypothetical signal peptide protein from s. medicae wsm <dig>  vbismb <dig> had 69% similary to a two component transcriptional regulator, luxr family from s. medicae wsm <dig>  vbisma <dig> partially matched to a putative dioxygenase with 25% similarity. vbismc <dig> matched to nodulation protein nolr with 59% similarity. the nolr protein is a transcriptional regulator for common nodulation genes as well as the three nodd copies present in s. meliloti. previous studies have shown that nolr gene in s. meliloti strain  <dig> has a single insertion in the c-terminal coding sequence which abolishes the dna-binding ability of the nolr protein  <cit> . thus, rm <dig> has no nolr activity. nolr- strains nodulate host plants less efficiently than nolr+ strains. in the refseq database, vbismc <dig> was not previously annotated as a gene although it is a mutant form of the nolr gene. here, we demonstrate and confirm that this mutant gene is expressed.

no neighboring genes were detected to be co-transcribed with vbismc <dig>  vbismb <dig> or vbisma <dig>  while vbismc <dig> was co-transcribed with the downstream gene smc <dig>  a hypothetical protein. the other six genes with blast hits matched only hypothetical proteins .

gene expression levels
because the rna amplification step was linear , we expect that the cdna samples we prepared represent relative mrna levels in the cell. thus, for a full sequencing run, with high coverage, the number of sequences would be a good indication of gene expression levels. due to the low coverage of our pilot experiment, we cannot yet estimate gene expression levels based on number of sequences for each gene. however, we expect that most of the genes that showed five or more matches to our transcriptome sequences should be highly expressed in the cell population . the known genes with high sequence copy number are consistent with our knowledge about the high expression level of those genes under the same growth condition .

discussion
our study demonstrated that there are many genes missed in the initial genome annotation and it is useful to have large-scale transcriptome analysis to reveal these genes and validate their status. our results showed that sequencing bacterial transcriptomes using the gs flx system is feasible and it helps to discover new genes and improve the genome annotation. a full gs flx sequencing run can produce an average yield of more than  <dig>  reads which is 20-fold greater than the yield from our titration run for this study. even with 90% rrna population in the sample, there will still be more than  <dig>  reads that are non-rrna transcripts. this provides an average 6x coverage of non-rrna genes. our pilot experiment with only  <dig> reads already identified  <dig> new genes. with a full sequencing run, which produces more than 20-fold reads than the titration run, we expect to discover many more new gene transcripts that have been previously missed. however, a full sequencing run with 6x coverage of non-rrna genes will still not be sufficient to discover all possible new genes expressed, especially for ones with low expression levels, and considering that conditions under which genes are expressed may not be known or studied by any particular set of experiments. according to the previous microarray studies, about 70-80% annotated genes are expressed under the same growth conditions as used in this study . nevertheless, our study suggests two ways to improve the results: the first is to more effectively remove rrna or use a normalized cdna library; the second is to employ "deep" sequencing techniques, either by performing multiple gs flx runs, or by using illumina  <cit>  or abi  <cit>  methods which produce millions of reads, but of smaller average length.

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicated that there are still many genes missed in the initial genome annotation of s. meliloti. high-throughput sequence analysis of bacterial transcriptomes is feasible for the identification of new genes. next-generation sequencing technologies will greatly facilitate the gene discovery process and improve genome annotation.
