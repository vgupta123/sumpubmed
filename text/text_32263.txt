BACKGROUND
translocation across the cell membrane requires the presence of short signal sequences termed "signal peptides" that are localized at the amino terminus  of proteins  <cit> . these n-termini localized signal peptides are subsequently removed from the newly synthesized precursor proteins by type i signal peptidases   <cit> . spases play essential roles in the viability of bacteria  <cit> , making these enzymes attractive targets for the design of novel antibiotics  <cit> . currently, escherichia coli is by far the most widely used host organism for the bacterial expression of heterologous secreted proteins, especially for therapeutic purposes, with reported yields of 5– <dig> g/l  <cit> . mutations in the signal peptide have been known to affect secretion either by enhancing the processing of the cleavage site or by inhibiting this proteolytic processing  <cit> . it is well known that besides the signal peptide, the n-terminal region of the mature protein also affects the protein secretion  <cit> . we are therefore interested in understanding the determinants involved in signal peptide recognition, binding and cleavage.

the e. coli type i spase is of particular interest in the study of type i spases, as its active site is relatively accessible at the bacterial membrane surface  <cit> . although many mutational and biochemical studies have been performed, basic questions such as spase fidelity and substrate specificity remain unanswered. signal peptides exhibit limited primary sequence homology, but are well conserved at residues positioned - <dig>  to - <dig>  relative to the cleavage site, designated p1-p1'  <cit> . comparative analysis of  <dig> prokaryotic signal peptides reveals that type i spases specifically recognizes substrates with small neutral residues at both the p <dig> and p <dig> positions  <cit> . p <dig> is dominated by the presence of alanine, glycine, serine, threonine and valine; while p <dig> is characterized by alanine, glycine, serine and threonine  <cit> . accordingly, the p <dig> and p <dig> positions have been proposed to constitute the spase cleavage site and have been actively applied by various groups for predicting signal peptide cleavage sites  <cit> . these findings were cited as affirmation of the location of two key determinants within the signal peptide cleavage site. unfortunately, no solution structures exist that can illustrate precisely how the precursor protein is oriented within the spase substrate-binding site prior to proteolysis, or the identity of other critical determinants that control substrate specificity  <cit> .

in this paper, we report the modeling of an e. coli periplasmic dithiol oxidase, dsba 13– <dig> in complex with e. coli type i spase based on the crystal structures of e. coli spase in complex with β-lactam  <cit>  and lipopeptide  <cit>  inhibitors. the dsba 13– <dig> precursor protein was selected for this study due to its efficient periplasmic secretion  <cit> . by threading the p <dig> to p1' positions against the solved structures of β-lactam  <cit>  and lipopeptide  <cit>  inhibitors, our model reveals that precursor protein is bound to e. coli type i spase with a pronounced twist between positions p <dig> and p1'. thirteen subsites s <dig> to s6' were identified that might be critical to these and other aspects of catalysis. our model was additionally corroborated by comparative analysis of  <dig> experimentally validated substrates.

RESULTS
substrate binding site
the energetically favoured and most frequently populated bound conformation of dsba 13– <dig> h2n-lafsasaΔaqyedg-cooh, where the cleavage site is indicated by Δ  <cit> , to e. coli type i spase was obtained from our structural model. the complex defines  <dig> enzyme subsites, s <dig> to s6', within the spase substrate binding site, interacting with bound precursor spases. among these, six smaller clefts or 'pockets' were identified at subsites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s1', s3' and s4' respectively . the narrow clefts at s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s1' play direct roles in the high specificity of the signal peptide residues while the larger clefts at s3' and s4' may be responsible for the specificity of the mature moieties.

the side chain of ala <dig>  is buried within the s <dig> subsite, which is composed of primarily hydrophobic and non-polar enzyme residues including the previously identified ile <dig>  pro <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  met <dig>  leu <dig>  tyr <dig>  ile <dig> and lys <dig>  <cit> . the s <dig> subsite  constitutes the deepest cavity within the substrate-binding site. this pocket can accommodate residues with large side chains and appears to play an important role in substrate specificity of e. coli type i spase, consistent with biochemical experiments . this subsite, formerly proposed as the s <dig> subsite by paetzel et al.  <cit> , largely overlaps with the s <dig> subsite due to a pronounced twist in the p <dig> to p1' binding conformation . our model reveals that the ser <dig>  side chain is not solvent exposed but is completely buried at this location, due to a pronounced twist in the p <dig> to p1' binding conformation . the s <dig> subsite, which is composed of non-polar atoms from residues phe <dig>  gln <dig>  ile <dig>  pro <dig>  ile <dig>  val <dig>  asp <dig> and ile <dig>  <cit> , is located diagonally across from the s <dig> subsite. this pocket constitutes the third deepest cavity within the substrate-binding site and can accommodate a wide variety of side chains. the s <dig> subsite consisting of phe <dig>  gln <dig>  pro <dig> and asp <dig>  is in contact with ser <dig> . further upstream, the s <dig> subsite is defined by phe <dig>  gln <dig> and asp142; s <dig> consists of pro <dig> and phe84; while the s <dig> subsite includes glu <dig> and pro <dig> 

at the p1' to p6' positions of the mature moiety, our model indicates that the side chains of p1' to p5' residues are in position to make significant contact with the e. coli type i spase. the s1' subsite shares similar residues with the s <dig> subsite and includes ser <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig> and ala <dig>  the s2' subsite includes ser <dig>  ser <dig>  phe <dig>  asn <dig> and ala <dig>  the s3' and s4' subsites constitute a broad pocket that can accommodate both positive and negative charged residues by rearrangements of side chains . the s3' subsite is composed of met <dig>  tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  asn <dig>  ala <dig>  arg <dig> and tyr <dig>  while the s4' subsite includes gln <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  asn <dig> and arg <dig>  further downstream, the s5' subsite consists of phe <dig>  ser <dig>  ala <dig>  asp <dig> and asn <dig>  while the s6' subsite includes phe <dig>  ile <dig> and ala <dig> 

in our model, the bound precursor protein makes significant contact with e. coli spase i from s <dig> to s6'. models described earlier only focused on the p3-p1' segment and did not analyze in full the different substrate binding pockets on either side of the scissile bond. in particular, the s <dig> subsite was formerly proposed as the s <dig> subsite by paetzel et al.  <cit>  as it largely overlaps with the latter. in contrast to the analysis by paetzel et al.  <cit> , our model reveals that the ser <dig>  side chain is not solvent exposed but is completely buried at this location. the ability of s3'/s4' to alter their electrostatic requirements by varying side chain conformations  may help explain the propensity to find substrates with charged amino acids at these positions .

substrate binding conformation
we have modeled the coordinates of p <dig> to p1' by threading against the solved structures of β-lactam  <cit>  and lipopeptide  <cit>  inhibitors in complex with e. coli spase, followed by ab initio docking of the p2' to p6' positions . the precursor protein, dsba 13– <dig> is bound to e. coli type i spase in an extended conformation with a pronounced backbone twist between ala <dig>  and ala <dig>  . in the p3-p1' segment, the first three side chains are all oriented towards the binding groove, and only the p1' side chain oriented across the binding groove. as shown in figure  <dig>  similar interactions between the e. coli type  <dig> spase with dsba 13– <dig> model, lipopeptide inhibitor  and β-lactam inhibitor  were observed. the conformation of p3' and p4' allow their corresponding side-chains to extend into a large cavity . as such, medium or large residues are preferred at these two positions for favorable interactions. good agreement with the known experimental data  is obtained, supporting the validity of our model.

ten positions for hydrogen bonding were identified supporting high affinity binding between e. coli spase and dsba 13– <dig>  these include ser <dig>  o...ser <dig> nh, ser <dig>  o...ser <dig> og, ala <dig>  n...ser <dig> og, gly <dig> n...gln <dig>  oe <dig>  ala <dig>  n...ser <dig> og, ser <dig> og...ala <dig>  o, lys <dig> nz...ala <dig>  o, gln <dig> ne <dig> ..asp <dig>  od <dig>  ser <dig> og...asp <dig>  od <dig> and arg <dig> nh <dig> ..glu <dig>  oe <dig>  our model suggests that the enzyme-substrate contact points extend all the way from p <dig> to p6' of the dsba precursor protein.

the orientation of dsba 13– <dig> side chains within the active site  of e. coli spase adopts the pattern  <cit> : ↓ • • • ↓ ↓ ↓ • • ↓ ↓ • • . specifically, the p3-p1' segment adopts the pattern: ↓ ↓ ↓ •, with the side chains of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> oriented towards the binding groove thereby supporting the stringent selectivity criteria in this region. the side chain of p1' alone is oriented differently, in accord with the observed variability in this position. a similar conformation was obtained for the precursor sequence ompa 15– <dig>  <cit>  h2n-fatvaqaΔatstkk-cooh  in complex with e. coli type  <dig> spase . here again, the p3-p1' side chains of ompa adopt the orientation ↓ ↓ ↓ •, while the model proposed by paetzel et al.  <cit>  and ekici et al.  <cit> , adopts the pattern ↓ • ↓ •, with the side chain of p <dig> not pointing towards the binding groove. the disparity between our model and paetzel et al.  <cit>  may be attributed to the selection of different template structures where the structures of the covalently bound peptide inhibitor complex and the analogous enzyme lexa were used to guide the p <dig> and p <dig> to p <dig> positions of the later  <cit> , while the coordinates of p <dig> to p1' for our model were guided by the solved structures of β-lactam  <cit>  and lipopeptide  <cit>  inhibitors in complex with e. coli spase. in our models, the p <dig> side chains in the bound dsba and ompa models are hydrogen-bonded to the catalytically important spase i residue, ser <dig>  <cit> . the twist in the backbone conformation in the region p3-p1' is representative of the transition state, with three critical hydrogen bonds conserved in our model and the bound β-lactamase and lipoprotein inhibitors, with the atoms ser <dig> oγ, ser <dig> oγ and lys <dig> nζ important for catalytic activity.

substrate specificity
we were interested in understanding how the peptides modeled in this study reflect the e. coli repertoire of secreted signals. comparative analysis of  <dig> experimentally determined e. coli type i spase substrates  revealed high conservation of amino acid residues at positions p <dig> and p <dig>  in particular, position p <dig> is dominated by small , hydrophobic , and neutral  residues, with alanine being the predominant residue  at this position, followed by glycine . position p <dig> shows a strong preference for bigger side chains with 87%  possessed by medium- or large-sized residues at this location. position p <dig> also shows a preference for hydrophobic residues . although this position contains mainly small amino acid residues , it can also accommodate both medium  and large  residues. only 50%  of the sequences contain the consensus ala-x-ala recognition motif, while even fewer sequences  contain a val-x-ala recognition sequence. in our modeled structure for dsba propeptide, the side chains from p <dig> to p <dig> are also in positions to make substantial contacts with spase , but are not confined to 'pockets'. nonetheless, these residues may also participate in binding by interacting with surface residues of spase. these observations are in accord with the lack of residue preference observed in these positions . overall, in the  <dig> signal peptide dataset, neutral residues  are preferred in positions p <dig> to p <dig>  indicating that charged interactions between signal peptides and e. coli type i spase are disfavored in this stretch, consistent with earlier reports on the carboxy-terminus of the c-region  <cit> . however, few signal sequences possess polar residues at the c-region , in contrast with earlier studies  <cit> . most residues are tolerated at the + <dig>  position of the mature moiety, with the exception of the large hydrophobes, ile, met, trp, pro and arg. here, pro is disfavored as the rigid positioning of its backbone hinders docking interactions with spase at positions p2' to p6'. the majority of e. coli signal peptides contain medium or large residues both at p3'  and at p4'  positions. the propensity for negatively charged residues to occur at p3' and p4' positions are low, with observed values of 10%  and 19%  respectively, while 8%  and 13%  respectively of the sequences analyzed have positively charged residues at these positions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a structural model for e. coli spase i complex, with bound dsba and ompa propeptides, consistent with existing biochemical data and solution structures of e. coli type i spase-inhibitor complexes  <cit> . the developed models provided an opportunity to examine the bound structure of e. coli type i spase complex that have been difficult to solve experimentally. it appears that both signal and mature moiety sequences play direct role in catalysis. this work advances our understanding of the molecular mechanism governing signal peptide specificities and spase fidelity, it also serves as a useful guide for designing suitable signal and mature peptide sequences for enhancing heterologous protein expression using e. coli as the host organism.
