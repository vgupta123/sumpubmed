BACKGROUND
janus kinases  have broad roles in immune regulation via their action in cytokine signalling  <cit> . these non-receptor tyrosine kinases phosphorylate receptor chains, which in turn recruit and phosphorylate members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription  family  <cit> . the jak family comprises jak <dig>  jak <dig>  jak <dig> and tyk <dig>  these enzymes have very similar domain structures, containing a ferm domain, an sh <dig> domain, a pseudokinase domain, and a catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. jaks serve overlapping but distinct functions in cytokine signaling, as demonstrated by knockout, mutation and other studies  <cit> .

because of their roles in the signaling of many important cytokines, hormones, and growth factors such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-α, ifn-γ, epo, and gm-csf  <cit> , jak inhibitors might have wide application in the treatment of inflammatory, myeloproliferative and autoimmune diseases, and therefore the jak enzymes are attractive targets for drug discovery. initial studies with jak <dig> inhibitors were aimed at preventing solid organ transplant rejection  <cit> . more recent studies have explored the potential of such compounds in chronic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis  <cit> . for example, tofacitinib , which inhibits jak <dig>  jak <dig>  and jak <dig>  has demonstrated efficacy in phase ii trials for rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . ruxolitinib , a dual jak <dig> and jak <dig> inhibitor  <cit> , was recently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis, a disorder involving myeloproliferative neoplasm.

the development of tyk <dig> inhibitors is less advanced. tyk <dig> functions together with jak <dig> in the signaling of il- <dig> and il- <dig> via its interaction with the il-12rβ <dig> receptor chain, and in the coordinated phosphorylation of stat <dig> & stat <dig>  <cit> . human tyk <dig> gene deficiency causes defects in signaling of multiple cytokines, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and reduced production of ifnγ  <cit> . furthermore, tyk2-deficient mice are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis  <cit> . given the importance of tyk2-dependent downstream cytokine signaling in this and other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and crohn’s disease, tyk <dig> inhibitors have the potential to be important therapeutics.

because jak family active sites exhibit high sequence identity, designing inhibitors selective within the family is challenging. one way to approach this challenge is to target active site regions that differ in conformation between homologs. to identify these “hot-spot” regions, we set out to obtain multiple crystal structures of tyk <dig> in complex with a variety of ligands representing diverse chemotypes. at the time of our initial work, only jak <dig> and jak <dig> crystal structures had been published  <cit> . robust tyk <dig> crystallography allowing for the soaking of multiple inhibitors, essential for rapid throughput in structure-based drug design, had not been described. after exploring multiple constructs, we obtained crystals of mouse tyk <dig> in the presence of 3-aminoindazole inhibitors that diffracted to  <dig> – <dig>  Å resolution. the inclusion of a ligand was absolutely required to obtain high-quality crystals, and we found through limited proteolysis experiments that the enzyme is significantly stabilized by binding to such atp-competitive inhibitors. this process enabled the determination of multiple inhibitor-soaked tyk <dig> crystal structures, forming the basis of an extensive sbdd program.

RESULTS
construct design and purification strategies
several strategies were employed to obtain sufficient protein purification yields for crystallization:  variation of n- and c-terminal boundaries of the tyk <dig> catalytic domain ;  variation of the affinity purification tag;  introduction of a kinase-inactivating mutation; and  use of multiple orthologs. table  <dig> lists the different strategies and examples employed for tyk <dig> construct design. after exploring roughly  <dig> constructs , we prioritized a mouse construct that produced adequate amounts of soluble protein for crystallization  asp1016ala). the human and mouse tyk <dig> catalytic domain sequences are highly conserved ; however, several divergent surface residues had the potential to impact protein aggregation and crystallization behavior. a glutathione-s-transferase  tag was included to increase solubility during early stages of purification, and the asp1016ala kinase-inactive mutation was introduced to increase conformational homogeneity by preventing multiple phosphorylation states; this mutation also increased expression approximately three-fold . asp <dig> is the conserved catalytic base that is essential for phosphotransferase activity in protein kinases  <cit> .

previous attempts to purify the human tyk <dig> protein using multiple chromatographic steps resulted in low yields or no detectable protein. due to the aggregation and solubility problems seen with the human isoform, orthologs were considered and an abbreviated purification protocol was implemented. this protocol entailed batch binding to gst resin for several hours, followed by a resin wash and an “on column” tev protease cleavage step. a critical step was to introduce the ligand   at low protein concentrations, to prevent precipitation, and subsequently to co-concentrate the tyk2/compound  <dig> complex to a level useful for crystallization trials. compound  <dig>  was one of the few inhibitors that co-crystallized with mouse tyk <dig>  allowing us to determine the structure of the mouse tyk <dig> kinase domain. we also present the structure of compound  <dig> complexed to mouse tyk <dig>  which was solved using inhibitor soaking methods.

proteolysis reveals stabilization of enzyme in presence of inhibitor
despite not directly forming crystal contacts, we found that inclusion of an atp-competitive inhibitor was required for formation of mouse tyk <dig> crystals. to understand the importance of ligand binding to the overall stability of the enzyme, we measured the tyk <dig> kinase domain’s susceptibility to proteolysis in the presence and absence of a ligand. compound  <dig>  significantly increased resistance to partial proteolysis by thermolysin . minor processing of the kinase domain from ~ <dig> kda  to ~ <dig> kda form by thermolysin is unaffected by addition of compound  <dig>  suggesting that its binding in the atp site is insufficient to prevent cleavage of one of the extreme termini of our tyk <dig> kinase domain construct. however, the rate of degradation of the enzyme to smaller forms  is reduced by 13-fold . like all protein kinases, the atp binding site for tyk <dig> is nestled between the n-terminal and c-terminal lobes. our proteolysis data suggest that the conformational flexibility of the kinase, other than a ~ <dig> kda portion of one terminus , is decreased by the binding of these 3-aminoindazole inhibitors. the ability of compound  <dig> to enable robust tyk <dig> crystallization may be related, as inhibitor-induced decreased flexibility may favorably affect entropic loss during crystal nucleation and growth.

tyk <dig> crystal structure
the overall structure of the mouse tyk <dig> kinase domain is very similar to that of the recently reported human tyk <dig> kinase domain complexed to cp- <dig>     <cit> . two particular sequence differences between mouse and human tyk <dig> may enable the crystallization of the mouse ortholog. the structure revealed that the substitution of glu <dig> and gly <dig> for ala <dig> and asp <dig> in human tyk <dig> permits gly <dig> to form a close, van der waals crystal contact. additionally, there is a potential interaction between glu <dig> and arg <dig> in an adjacent molecule in the crystal lattice. primarily due to steric clashes, a similar crystal packing would not be possible in human tyk <dig>  figure 4a illustrates the sequence alignment between the mouse and human tyk <dig> catalytic domains, and figure 4b provides a view of this crystal contact.

the mouse tyk2/compound  <dig> co-crystal structure is illustrated in figure 5a. the 3-aminoindazole core serves as a canonical hinge binder, forming three hydrogen bonding interactions with hinge residues glu <dig> and val <dig>  the inhibitor’s central phenyl group linker positions the sulfonamide chlorophenyl group under the glycine rich loop. figure 4a shows that the chlorophenyl moiety occupies a distinct hydrophobic pocket proximal to the dfg pocket. the placement of this moiety is guided by the sulfonamide linkage’s stabilizing interactions with the nh backbone of glu <dig> in the glycine-rich loop, and conserved residues asn <dig> and arg <dig>  the structure of tyk <dig> and compound  <dig> is illustrated in figure 5b. the binding mode and trajectory of the chlorophenyl is identical to that of compound  <dig> and, as a result, the glycine-rich loop adopts the same conformation in both structures. the furan substituent on the hinge-binding 3-aminoindazole core was well-ordered, providing clear evidence that the inhibitor soak was successful. the furan occupies the extended hinge region, sandwiched between arg <dig> and gly <dig> 

one notable secondary structure difference between the co-crystallized mouse tyk2/compound  <dig> complex and the recent human tyk2/cmp- <dig> complex  occurs at the tip of the glycine-rich loop. an overlay shows that compound  <dig> induces a ~ <dig> Å upward shift in the loop , resulting in a more open active site conformation. in a recent review, it was suggested that the conformational dynamics of the glycine-rich loop may differ within the jak family  <cit> . this may be due to sequence diversity in the glycine-rich loops of jak <dig>  jak <dig>  jak <dig> and tyk <dig>  specifically, in tyk <dig> and jak <dig>  a “collapsed” glycine-rich loop conformation may depend upon an interaction between a histidine residue and a proximal aspartate . these residues are absent in jak <dig> and jak <dig>  in the mouse tyk <dig> structures, complexed to either compound  <dig> or compound  <dig>  the steric bulk of the sulfonamide chlorophenyl moiety occupies substantial hydrophobic space under the glycine-rich loop and would potentially disrupt the his/asp “glycine-rich loop lock,” thereby creating a larger active site pocket. while there are crystal contacts near the loop, we believe, based on multiple crystal structures determined with different soaked inhibitors , that the loop conformation is driven mainly by the ligand. we cannot rule out, however, that some differences in loop conformation between human and mouse tyk <dig> may be driven by crystal packing. despite a more open conformation, we hypothesize that mouse tyk <dig> was able to crystallize with these inhibitors because the chlorophenyl moiety stabilized the flexible glycine-rich loop. inclusion of the chloro group also improves potency by roughly 10-fold in an enzyme activity assay .

CONCLUSIONS
after exploring multiple expression constructs, including trials with several orthologs and mutations, we developed a method for rapid structure determination of tyk2/inhibitor complexes suitable for iterative sbdd. we obtained crystals with a kinase-inactive form of the mouse tyk <dig> catalytic domain, only in the presence of an atp-competitive 3-aminoindazole inhibitor. this crystal form provided a robust inhibitor soaking platform that enabled structure-based drug design of jak inhibitors. we showed by partial proteolysis that binding of a 3-aminoindazole dramatically stabilizes tyk <dig> relative to the unliganded enzyme. the resulting two crystal structures demonstrated the ability of these inhibitors to stabilize the glycine-rich loop and thus to promote conformational homogeneity. our work indicates that compound-dependent stabilization of proteins targeted for crystallography can be a useful strategy to enable structure-based drug design.
