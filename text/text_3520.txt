BACKGROUND
in april of  <dig>  the explosion of the deepwater horizon oil drilling platform initiated the largest deep water oil release in the history of the petroleum industry culminating in more than  <dig> million gallons of crude oil released into the environment  <cit> . this incident has greatly impacted the natural and economic resources of many gulf of mexico coastal areas  <cit> .

for several decades fundulus heteroclitus has been an important model organism employed in environmental toxicology studies of heavily polluted superfund sites throughout the northeastern united states  <cit> . we have leveraged the body of existing scientific work surrounding f. heteroclitus in the analysis of high throughput sequencing techniques applied to natural fundulus grandis populations, a closely-related sister species inhabiting dh-impacted sites in the gulf of mexico  <cit> . this application holds promise for revealing induction of environmental stress with genome-wide molecular genetic response patterns. deploying these techniques within natural populations for which no underlying genomic information is available also holds the potential to track responses in the most situation-appropriate and ecologically relevant species, and be used to follow ecosystem recovery  <cit> . herein we provide methodological detail and results of transcriptome expression comparisons between populations of f. grandis sampled directly from the environment affected by the dh oil release versus those from unaffected populations.

in this study we assembled a reference transcriptome from representative natural populations of f. grandis collected from gulf coast estuaries ranging from texas to florida. we quantified liver mrna expression from sequences produced using the illumina gaiix platform. a statistical framework was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in oil-exposed versus non-exposed samples. our results show a complex response including activation of ahr and related pathways previously shown to be important in response to xenobiotic hydrocarbons, as well as some previously undocumented gene responses. we also show that these results compare favorably with a microarray-based method. additionally we compiled abundant transcript sequence data for a species not previously studied in this manner. and finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques for addressing similar events in the future while studying organisms key to a habitat instead of being restricted to a well studied model of lesser significance.

RESULTS
short read filtration
the exposed  samples e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> and the unexposed  u <dig> and u <dig> samples had between 81% and 94% overall pass rates and most of the reads that passed remained paired . after filtration  <dig> , <dig> reads remained.

transcript assembly
we selected a transcriptome assembly based on the features of the n <dig> plot over a range of k-mer lengths from  <dig> to  <dig>  the point k =  <dig> was the highest k-mer length in what seemed to be a plateau of n <dig> values before the n <dig> began to dip . the average length over all sequences in this assembly is 599bp with an n <dig> value of  <dig> bp, and when contigs shorter than 500bp are excluded these values rise to  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively. these statistics indicate a population of robust and contiguous sequences among smaller fragmentary contigs. the final set obtained after mapping reads and removing those transcripts with fewer than  <dig> mapped reads contains  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. we were able to annotate 45% of the assembled contigs with a total of  <dig>  unique sequence descriptions.

while this set still contains many small fragments and some sequence overlaps, it indicates that two sequencing technologies are not necessary for de novo assembly of non-model organisms as is common practice in recently published studies  <cit>  with which our methods compare favorably.

differentially expressed genes
there exists subtle but significant genetic structure within f. grandis, where population divergence generally follows a pattern of isolation-by-distance with longitude across the northern gulf of mexico. our “western” pool of samples  included fish from the western phylogeographic cluster of populations, whereas the “eastern” pool of samples  included fish from the eastern phylogeographic cluster of populations  <cit> . grand terre, our oil-impacted site, is located near the center of the species’ range , and fish from this site have greatest affinity to the western phylogeographic cluster of populations. among our reference fish are animals from leeville, la, which is only  <dig>  km from the grand terre site; significant genetic structure is not observed within this species at that geographic scale  <cit> . since our reference samples are representative of the genetic diversity within the species, including from southern louisiana, we consider it unlikely that genetic variation among populations confounds the treatment effects that we observe. seasonal changes should also be minimal as fish were collected during the months of april  and june . as shown in figure  <dig>  the unexposed samples cluster separately from the exposed samples bearing out the self-similarity of the pooled unexposed samples, and indicating global differences between the two sets. 

at a significance level of p <  <dig> , we determined a set of  <dig>  up and  <dig>  down-regulated sequences . the assembly contains long well-assembled sequences in addition to short fragments, and the color-coding of points by length reveals that the longer sequences tend to provide more statistical power . the short length of these reads, however, is beneficial when matching them to short sequence fragments. this allows many of the shorter contigs to also provide useful data . many of the sequences are alternative assemblies of the same original transcript or are fragments of the same transcript. thus, we used the annotations derived from blast searching against the non-redundant database  to group transcripts that likely represent the same gene by unique sequence annotations. this resulted in  <dig>  down-regulated and  <dig>  up-regulated unique sequence annotations. that still leaves  <dig>  significantly differently expressed sequences that lack annotation, where  <dig> of these sequences are over 1kb in length. some of these may be entirely new gene products unknown to prior studies while others are likely assembly errors.

among the more interesting genes that were differentially expressed are two up-regulated aryl-hydrocarbon receptor sequences  . the response of ahr pathway genes has been well documented following exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons, where activation of this pathway is diagnostic of exposure to this class of pollutant  <cit> . downstream in the ahr response pathway are cytochrome p <dig> genes; cyp1c  and cyp1b <dig> are found to be up-regulated in the exposed sample , while others in the cyp2n and cyp2x sub-families are down-regulated . whereas previous studies have highlighted the response of cyp1a to dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and other similar pollutants, in this analysis we detected no significant difference in cyp1a mrna expression upon exposure to dh oil. to verify this we searched the assembled f. grandis transcript sequences using the f. heteroclitus cyp1a sequence and found that only small fragments existed in the de novo assembly. we then mapped f. grandis reads to the f. heteroclitus cyp1a sequence and analyzed its expression in the context of the assembled sequences. while there was an increase in the expression values in the oil exposed sample relative to either of the unexposed samples, it did not pass the p-value threshold. it may be that by the time of collection the animals had been exposed to levels and durations of dh oil or some prior exposure causing a de-sensitized response by cyp1a response in the exposed population. alternately, since a previous study that used the same rna-seq data did find a significant increase in cyp1a, but used f. heteroclitus ests as the reference transcriptome  <cit> , it could be that the residual fragmentary and erroneous sequences in the de novo assembly led to reduced statistical power for some sequences.

given clear damage to killifish gills caused by contaminating oil  <cit> , one might anticipate that compromised gill function, coupled with limited oxygen exchange between air and water in oil-slick contaminated areas, could result in hypoxic stress. in the up-regulated gene set from dh oil exposed animals we find several genes suggesting a hypoxic response. hypoxia inducible factor 2-alpha, its co-activator e1a binding protein p <dig>  and the activity enhancing nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig> are all up-regulated  <cit>  . it should be noted that the estuaries inhabited by f. grandis often experience transient periods of hypoxia , and given the broad range of sampling sites it is likely that our reference set includes rna from individuals experiencing hypoxic conditions to some degree, thus capturing a range of normal and hypoxic expression levels for these genes. the inclusion of reference individuals exposed to hypoxia would make it more difficult to statistically identify a hypoxic response in the exposed population. therefore, the genes indicated here are likely a conservative set of hypoxia response genes. 

another broad set of up-regulated genes in dh oil exposed fish indicates an immune response perhaps by circulatory leukocytes. the secreted form of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain and heavy chain variable regions are both indicative of an active immune response. tumor necrosis factor receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  involved in immune response signaling pathways, are both up-regulated . previous studies have noted an association between an immune response induced by hypoxia and/or hif <dig> activation  <cit> , and hydrocarbons are well-known to alter immune system function  <cit> .

the set of genes that appears to be down-regulated in response to dh oil exposure is also large and diverse. one large group of down regulated transcripts includes a wide selection of 40s and 60s ribosomal proteins . a similar response has been reported in hypoxic conditions in zebrafish gills  <cit> , and may be explained by an overall reduction in protein synthesis as a survival strategy during hypoxic conditions  <cit> .

one final group of genes that was previously observed to be strongly down-regulated are the group of choriogenins chgl, chgh, and chghm <cit> . the sequences for these are highly repetitive and so did not assemble well. thus they did not originally show up in our analysis except as unidentified small fragments albeit with expression levels that would confirm earlier observations. to better examine the expression levels in the context of the rest of the assembly, we added the f. heteroclitus cdna sequences to the assembled contigs and recalculated differential expression for these in the context of the rest of the assembled sequences. the results confirm that choriogenin genes are strongly down-regulated . as has been previously noted, the expression of these genes is estrogen-dependent and is down-regulated by exposure to pahs  <cit> .

comparison to microarrays
the results of the microarray-based analysis correlate well with those measured by rna-seq . one notable difference is that the dynamic range of expression levels seems to be much wider in the rna-seq method versus those observed for microarray results. the rna-seq method exhibits results for values ranging from approximately + <dig> to - <dig> log <dig> fold change while the microarray results are in a more narrow range of approximately ±  <dig> fold. this may indicate a greater sensitivity in the rna-seq based methodology which is an observation that is consistent with other similar comparisons  <cit> . for the set of best hits between the data sets we calculated a pearson’s correlation of r =  <dig> , while the set of sequences found to be significant in both analyses had an r value of  <dig> . these indicate a reasonable correlation between the two data sets with a high degree of variability, and are similar to results of other such comparisons  <cit> . much of the variation between the data sets is likely related to the fact that only the exposed samples were common among the two analyses; the un-exposed samples in each used mrna from different sets of fish. the unexposed rna-seq data represent two pools of  <dig> and  <dig> individuals collected from sites on both sides of the mississippi river, while the microarray data set is comprised of a separate set of  <dig> individual animals collected in the summer of  <dig> from different sites along the gulf of mexico. 

CONCLUSIONS
assembly of mrna transcript data is a challenging task that is complicated further when using wild outbred animals that have significant genetic variability between and within populations and which lack prior est or genome sequence data. however, data provided here suggest that useful analysis can be achieved with reference to phylogenetically similar species. additionally, illumina short read data have recently been shown to be more resilient to fragmentary, incomplete sequences as targets for alignment for digital gene expression  <cit>  as would likely be the case in non-model organisms. we suggest that with improvements in assembly techniques, digital gene expression results are likely to improve and become increasingly valuable tools for assessing environmental damage and recovery after anthropogenic perturbation. thus, the methods provided here indicate that rna-seq can be used to investigate global mrna expression levels in a very wide variety of organisms, such that the most appropriate species for particular research questions in environmental science may be exploited.

in this case, rna-seq studies of wild populations of the small teleost fish  collected from estuaries in the gulf of mexico show broad and complex molecular genomic responses to dh oil exposure. in comparison to samples collected from a varied set of gulf of mexico coastal sites in  <dig>  the fish from estuaries with oil in the water exhibited mrna expression patterns consistent with exposure to the toxic components of oil . in addition to expected indicators of ah exposure, the rna-seq based techniques used here revealed effects on several cellular systems, such as the immune response and effects on the wide variety of ribosomal proteins, that might not have been specifically interrogated by a more focused examination of specific pathways through smaller-scale techniques. additionally, the specific gene responses we have analyzed and discussed here represent only a handful of the thousands of significant up and down regulated gene sets. this data set will continue to provide insight into the full effects of this oil exposure as results are compared with other similar studies. the rna-seq results are also similar to a distinct and independent microarray study and thus lend validity to the overall methods employed and results of the study.
