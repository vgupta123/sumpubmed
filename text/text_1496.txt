BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory disease , also known as mystery swine disease or blue ear disease, emerged in the late 80’s and 90’s and is one of the most economically important diseases affecting pigs worldwide  <cit> . the disease results in severe reproductive losses, such as late-term abortions and mummified and stillborn fetuses, as well as neonatal piglets developing severe dyspnea and tachypnea and demonstrating an increased morbidity and mortality rate  <cit> . in weaned pigs, prrs manifests itself by pneumonia, lethargy, failure to thrive and a higher mortality rate, mainly due to the co-existence with other infections  <cit> . to date, production costs of prrs are estimated at $ <dig> million a year in the us alone  <cit> .

many efforts have been, and continue to be, made to understand the prrs virus , its replication and the immune response evoked in the host . modified live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines against prrsv are used widely, primarily to improve performance in prrs positive herds, but often fail to elicit complete protection particularly against highly heterologous prrsv isolates  <cit> . there therefore remains a need for novel strategies to combat prrs including the development of cross-protective prrsv vaccines. moreover, long-distance airborne transport of prrsv complicates control strategies even further  <cit> . the prrs host genetics consortium  was founded to investigate the potential for control of the disease from the host point of view  <cit> . boddicker et al.  <cit>  performed a genome wide association study  on the first three phgc trials with  <dig> infected weaner pigs and identified a region on sus scrofa chromosome  <dig>  surrounding a single nucleotide polymorphism  marker wur <dig>  that was strongly associated with weight gain and viral load after a prrs infection  <cit> . this association was validated and expanded to other pig crosses in an additional  <dig> phgc trials  <cit> . compared to ab and bb animals, the aa animals for the wur snp had higher levels of viremia measured over 21 days post-infection  and a reduced growth rate over  <dig> dpi. no differences were seen between ab and bb animals, pointing to a dominant effect of the b allele  <cit> . further examination of the region surrounding wur revealed that guanylate binding protein  <dig>  is a strong candidate gene, due to its differential expression during prrsv infection, the presence of splice variant differences between aa and ab animals and its role in inflammasome assembly during immune response  <cit> . we hypothesized that the global gene expression can be impacted by the genotype which is associated with the different host response. in order to elucidate these differences,  <dig> littermate pairs, each with one aa and one ab animal, from phgc trial  <dig> were selected for transcriptome analysis of blood collected up to 14 days post-infection using rna-seq.

RESULTS
identification and annotation of differentially expressed  transcripts over time
rna of whole blood from eight littermate pairs of aa and ab weaner pigs was collected at  <dig> time points  during a prrsv infection. weight gain over 42dpi, as well as viral load over 21dpi, measured as area under the log curve of viremia levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, did not significantly differ between these two groups of animals . prior to rna-seq analysis, most alpha and beta hemoglobin mrnas were removed to increase the detection of low abundance mrnas  <cit> . paired-end rna-seq reads were mapped to the sus scrofa genome to assign reads to annotated gene coordinates and mapped reads were normalized as described  <cit> . for simplicity, we will refer hereafter to transcripts as the entity whose expression is being estimated by the rna-seq data. a repeated measures linear model was used to estimate the effects of wur genotype, day, and genotype-by-day interactions. to identify de transcripts across time, a false discovery rate  of 5 % was used for all possible pairwise time point comparisons. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were found to be de among all time points. the number of de transcripts ranged from  <dig> in the 14/ <dig> dpi comparison to  <dig>  in the 14/ <dig> dpi comparison . gene ontology  term enrichment analysis was performed on all  <dig> comparisons . since the david and gorilla go annotation tool gave similar results, only david annotations and enrichment scores are shown. two informative comparisons were the list of transcripts that were de between  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi and between  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. go enrichment clearly demonstrates that early after infection inflammatory response functions were induced, followed by a switch to dna damage response, cell cycle checkpoints and dna replication .table  <dig> number of transcripts compared at each day post prrsv infection, regardless of wur genotype

to explore these results in more detail, biolayout express3d  was used to visualize and cluster all  <dig>  transcripts that were de across dpi . the histograms shown represent the expression patterns over time of the three largest clusters. the numbers on the y-axis correspond to the log <dig> fold change  of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi compared to  <dig> dpi. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig>  nodes and showed greater expression at  <dig> dpi compared to  <dig> dpi, which then decreased at later dpi. annotation of this cluster indicated enrichment of transcripts involved in inflammatory response, immune system development, anti-apoptosis, and cytokine and chemokine activity.fig.  <dig> biolayout express3d  clustering of  <dig>  transcripts that were de over time post prrsv infection. these transcripts were de at an fdr <  <dig>  in at least one of the  <dig> pairwise time point comparisons. a total of  <dig> clusters were formed. the histograms represent the expression patterns over time of the three largest clusters  that had enough nodes to perform a go term enrichment analysis



the second largest cluster, cluster  <dig>  contained  <dig>  nodes and was down-regulated at  <dig> dpi, but increased in expression over time and showed an up-regulated expression at  <dig> dpi. go terms such as ‘dna repair’, ‘dna damage checkpoint’, ‘nucleotide excision repair’, ‘dna packaging’, ‘mitosis’, and ‘ncrna and rrna processing’ were prominent in enrichment analysis of this cluster. thus, this clustering method verified and further specified the expression pattern of transcripts responsible for the inflammatory immune response that was highly expressed early after infection , as well as the set of transcripts representing dna repair functions  identified in the full de dataset go annotation shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and fig.  <dig> 

a third cluster, with  <dig> nodes, was up-regulated at  <dig> dpi compared to  <dig> dpi but down-regulated at all other dpi compared to  <dig> dpi and showed an enrichment of terms such as ‘g-protein coupled receptor’, ‘synaptic transmission’, ‘ion homeostasis’ and ‘ion channel complex’ . next, these clusters were further analyzed by contrasting their expression between genotypes.

identification and annotation of de transcripts between wur genotypes
an analysis of differences in transcript expression between animals with aa versus ab genotype at the wur snp could help unravel this large genotype effect on piglet growth and viral load post-infection. thus, transcript expression differences between aa and ab animals were compared within each day or averaged over all days. even at an fdr of 10 %, relatively few de transcripts were identified, ranging from only  <dig> de transcripts between aa and ab animals at  <dig> dpi, to  <dig> transcripts at  <dig> dpi  and no enriched go terms were found using david analysis . examining all  <dig>  genes with a genotype effect or a genotype x day interaction effect revealed go enrichment of “cytoplasmic vesicle” , “regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  activity”  and apoptosis  were revealed .table  <dig> number of transcripts compared between wur genotypes on a given day or averaged over all days



expression pattern differences between pigs with alternate wur genotypes could also be found for the three be3d clusters described earlier . aa and ab animals showed no significant difference in average expression for cluster  <dig> transcripts ; ab animals showed an overall higher average expression for the cluster  <dig> transcripts, however these were not significantly different either . remarkably, however, the average expression of cluster  <dig> transcripts was significantly different between aa and ab animals . the ab animals down-regulated the cluster  <dig> transcripts immediately after infection, while aa animals showed first an elevation up till  <dig> dpi, after which a decrease in expression was noticed. when examining differences between genotypes for cluster  <dig> transcripts on separate days rather than log2fc comparisons with  <dig> dpi, it became clear that differences between genotypes were greatest at  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi , but were not significant at  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi . principal component analysis  of data from individual dpi revealed that differential expression between aa and ab for these transcripts was already present at  <dig> dpi . further, the relative positions of aa and ab were reversed for all other dpi, indicating that genotype-specific expression patterns captured by principal component  <dig> , which explained over 75 % of the transcripts expression variance among samples, changed dramatically after day  <dig> fig.  <dig> expression over time of blood rna transcripts in the largest be3d clusters. clusters shown are based on all animals or by wur genotype. histograms for combined genotypes are repeated from fig.  <dig> for ease of comparison

validation of be3d cluster  <dig> with independent rna-seq data
the log2fc of the  <dig> transcripts of cluster  <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi compared to  <dig> dpi of phgc <dig> were plotted against the log2fc values for those transcripts for the same dpi contrasts in similar blood samples collected from  <dig> aa and  <dig> ab animals in the phgc <dig> rna-seq study . correlation coefficients were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   for 4/ <dig>  7/ <dig>  10-11/ <dig> and 14/ <dig> dpi respectively.

verification of be3d transcript clusters using weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
we used another clustering approach to verify that these clusters were robust and to further explore their biological meaning. using wgcna on datasets comparing  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi with  <dig> dpi and on datasets examining individual days , we found several modules whose eigengene was associated with wur genotype. the eigengene of a module is defined as the eigenvector associated with the first principal component of the expression matrix and is used as a linear combination of expression from all genes in the module  <cit> . significant modules showing interesting go enrichment are listed in table  <dig>  and table  <dig> , together with the number of transcripts in that module, their association with wur genotype, quantified by the correlation coefficient with wur code , and the nominal p-value for this association. when comparing go term enrichment, the results of these analyses were consistent with the be3d clustering results shown in fig.  <dig>  in table  <dig>  ‘sh <dig> domain, b, t, nk cell signaling pathways’ is a go term enriched in the fifth significant module in the 4/ <dig> dpi dataset, with greater expression in the aa animals, while in fig.  <dig>  expression of cluster  <dig>  annotated with immune response go terms, is also slightly greater in the aa animals compared to the ab animals at day  <dig> compared to  <dig>  similarly, the first and third significant modules in the 4/ <dig> dpi contrast, illustrating go terms such as ‘mitosis’, ‘dna damage checkpoint’ and ‘dna repair’, were elevated in the ab animals ; in fig.  <dig>  at 4/ <dig> dpi, the ab animals have greater expression of cluster  <dig>  which was annotated for dna repair. go terms such as ‘gpcr signaling pathway’, ‘ion transport’ and ‘ion homeostasis’ were enriched in wgcna modules in the 4/ <dig> dpi, 7/ <dig> dpi and 14/ <dig> dpi dataset with greater expression in the aa animals , and the expression of cluster  <dig>  annotated for these go terms, was significantly higher in the aa animals at all time points after infection.table  <dig> overview of modules of de genes whose eigengene is significantly correlated with wur genotype

the table here presented shows immune-related go enrichment across time-points. for 4/ <dig> dpi, 7/ <dig> dpi, 10/ <dig> dpi and 14/ <dig> dpi comparisons the significant modules  are listed together with the number of transcripts, the correlation coefficient with wur genotype, the nominal p-value for that correlation and the interesting gene ontology  terms, with enrichment scores in brackets. positive correlation coefficients point to modules that contain transcripts that are more highly expressed in aa than in ab animals. negative correlation coefficients refer to modules with transcripts that are more highly expressed in ab animals. rows are color-coded according to their agreement with go terms in clusters formed by biolayout express3d : green for cluster  <dig>  orange for cluster  <dig>  purple for cluster 3

the table here presented shows immune-related go enrichment at single time points. for  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi the significant modules  are listed together with their number of transcripts, the correlation coefficient, the nominal p-value for that correlation and the interesting gene ontology  terms, with enrichment scores in brackets. positive correlation coefficients point to modules that contain transcripts that are more highly expressed in the aa animals compared to the ab animals. negative correlation coefficients refer to modules with transcripts that are more highly expressed in the ab animals. rows are color-coded according to their agreement with go terms in clusters formed by biolayout express3d : green for cluster  <dig>  orange for cluster  <dig>  purple for cluster 3



examining each dpi separately with wgcna showed that enriched go terms such as ‘sh <dig> domain’ and’innate immune response’ appeared at  <dig> dpi in the aa animals and go terms such as ‘spindle’, ‘transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter’ and ‘mrna processing’ appear in ab animals at  <dig> dpi . enriched go terms pointing to similar functions as those enriched in cluster  <dig>  such as ‘gtpase regulatory activity’, gpcr signaling pathway’, ‘ion transport’ and ‘ion homeostasis’ can be found at  <dig> dpi in ab animals and at  <dig> dpi in aa animals . this indicates that ab animals, have these processes elevated before infection, relative to aa animals, after which their expression declines; whereas after infection aa animals maintain activation of such pathways. further, compared to ab animals, this difference was most apparent at  <dig> dpi.

cell type enrichment analysis 
after clustering transcripts in each dataset based on their expression patterns, both david and cten software were used to evaluate whether these clusters represent transcripts that were usually expressed by  certain cell type. if so, a difference in expression of the cluster between aa and ab animals could indicate an engagement, or lack of, certain cell types in one of the two genotypes. the cell type enrichment analyses were applied on the three clusters formed by be3d . for both david and cten, the most enriched cell types in cluster  <dig> were macrophages and monocytes, followed by myeloid cells, early erythroid cells, nk cells, b cells and t cells. this cluster represented an immune-related cluster, so it is not surprising that immune cells were enriched. cluster  <dig> showed an enrichment for lymphoblasts and leukemia-lymphoma with cten but david showed carcinoma cells and stem cell enrichment. based on cten, cluster  <dig> was characterized by transcripts that are mainly expressed in fetal thyroid and fetal lung tissue, and the “ion transport” go annotation of this cluster is consistent with the known importance of ion transport in these developing tissues . david analysis of cluster  <dig> showed very diverse cell types, illustrating that it was not easy to classify the transcripts of this cluster to a specific cell type.fig.  <dig> cell type enrichment analyses of genes identified as the three largest clusters from be3d. for david, enrichment scores  are shown in front of specific cell types. for cten, from red to light yellow are all significant enriched cell-types within each cluster transcript list , going from enriched to most enriched



regulatory impact factor  and phenotypic impact factor  analyses
we were also interested in determining whether specific transcripts could be identified as important players, or “hubs”, for the differences in expression between genotypes. we analyzed the full rna-seq dataset using rif and pif analyses  <cit> . whereas rif <dig> focuses on regulators that are differentially wired with highly abundant de transcripts between two groups of animals , rif <dig> ranks regulators that are predictors of the change in abundance of de transcripts  <cit> . the pif analysis scores transcripts high that are de and at the same time highly abundant, since a small difference in those highly abundant transcripts could impact networks greatly  <cit> . a de transcript that is not highly abundant will only have a high pif score when it is highly de. after imposing a |z-score| threshold of  <dig> to identify hubs with largest differences between genotypes in neighborhood connections, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts passed that threshold for rif <dig> and rif <dig> respectively, meaning that a relative large number of transcripts acted in a different way as regulator of other transcripts in their network between wur genotypes. table  <dig> and table  <dig> list the rif <dig> and rif <dig> |z-scores| for the  <dig> most extreme regulators. for the pif analysis, almost all transcripts  passed the threshold of significance . the top  <dig> transcripts are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> top  <dig> transcripts in both directions for the rif <dig> analysis. the rif <dig> analysis was performed on blood rna de genes contrasting ab minus aa animals.. the transcript id, gene symbol and gene name is shown, together with the rif <dig> calculated z-score. the positive rif <dig> scores are >  <dig>  which indicates a large difference between wur genotypes in linkages to these hub genes



iqgap <dig> was found in both the top rif <dig> and rif <dig> lists. iqgap <dig> binds calmodulin  and calm <dig>  which encodes the protein calmodulin, had one of the highest pif scores. other transcripts in these extreme rif and pif lists point to actin cytoskeleton forming processes  as well as to ubiquitin/proteosomal degradation , transcriptional and translational regulation , and endosomal trafficking .

discussion
the goal of this study was to identify key transcriptomic differences between aa and ab animals in order to understand why ab animals respond better to a prrsv infection. analysis using a linear model indicated only minor differences in expression patterns between these aa and ab animals over time. however, further analyses showed a slightly but not significantly higher expression of transcripts early after infection involved in general immune response in the susceptible aa animals compared to resistant ab animals, most likely evoked by monocytes, as indicated by the cten analysis. more substantial was the difference in expression of transcripts with dna damage repair go terms, with higher expression of transcripts involved in dna repair in the ab animals, especially early after infection. cluster  <dig> showed an enrichment for lymphoblasts and leukemia-lymphoma, carcinoma cells and stem cell enrichment. gene expression studies in lymphoblastic leukemia patients report involvement of dna repair and dna replication genes  <cit> . stem cells need to differentiate, especially during an immune response, which is consistent with the go terms found for cluster  <dig>  however, the most significant differences in transcript expression between the two wur genotypes were higher expression at  <dig> dpi in aa pigs for transcripts with go terms for the g-protein coupled receptor  pathway and ion transport, including for the more specific go terms ‘calcium’ ion transport and ‘calcium’ homeostasis, and higher expression at  <dig> dpi for ab animals for transcripts with similar functions . these patterns indicate greater involvement of the gpcr pathway and calcium ion transport/homeostasis in aa animals in response to a prrsv infection, or a higher contribution of these pathways in ab animals prior to infection, i.e., at  <dig> dpi. in fig.  <dig>  the pca results support this hypothesis, as the largest differences between genotypes were found at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, with the polarity of the pc <dig> difference between genotypes reversing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. aa animals at  <dig> dpi most closely resemble the ab animals at  <dig> dpi, which could be interpreted as a delayed activation of the cluster  <dig> transcripts until  <dig> dpi in the aa animals in comparison to the ab animals, who already express the cluster  <dig> transcripts at high levels before infection. in aa animals, a down-regulation of these cluster  <dig> transcripts starts after  <dig> dpi, while in ab animals this down-regulation initiates soon after  <dig> dpi.

gpcrs are known to activate phosphoinositide  <dig> kinase  and pi3k phosphorylates pip <dig> to pip <dig>  which leads to activation of akt  <cit> . it has been reported that the pi3k-akt signal transduction pathway is involved in prrsv entry  <cit> , and other viruses also make use of the pi3k pathway to enter the cells . with prrs, anti-apoptosis is often seen in the early stage of infection, and macrophages die by apoptosis only later  <cit> . it has been proposed that the pi3k-akt pathway is used by the virus to activate akt, which in turn phosphorylates pro-apoptotic proteins such as bad, caspase  <dig> and glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> beta . upon phosphorylation, these pro-apoptotic proteins are inactivated and apoptosis is delayed, allowing a short-term cellular survival during the initial stage of viral infection in favor of viral replication  <cit> . since this pi3k-akt pathway appears to be activated longer after infection in aa animals compared to ab animals, the virus may have a greater opportunity to infect cells and replicate in these animals, which makes them more susceptible to prrs.

ma et al.  <cit>  reported cytoskeletal reorganization by g-coupled protein receptors dependent on pi3k, a guanosine exchange factor , and rac <dig>  pip <dig> is involved in actin polymerization  <cit>  and our results support evidence of its involvement by a multitude of actin-related transcripts that are significantly differentially regulated between aa and ab, based on the rif analyses. insall and weiner  hypothesized that pip <dig> stimulates actin polymerization by recruitment and activation of rho gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig> 

iqgap is highly differentially wired, as indicated by a high rif score when comparing aa with ab animals, meaning that it regulates a considerable amount of transcripts differently. this gene is a gtpase activating protein that binds calmodulin, a calcium binding protein that was identified as a high pif transcript when comparing aa with ab animals , and is found to be important in cell migration through its function in actin polymerization  <cit> . iqgap is a scaffolding protein for rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  <cit>  and the actin binding activity of iqgap <dig> is believed to be regulated by calmodulin  <cit> . in addition, iqgap <dig> has been found to play a pivotal interactive role in several viral attack strategies  <cit> .

additional transcripts showing differential wiring between aa and ab animals in the rif analysis were involved in the endosomal trafficking, which is important for viral entry  <cit> , and in the ubiquitin/proteosomal degradation pathway, which is required for efficient viral replication  <cit> . tomm <dig> had one of the highest rif <dig> scores and may be important for viral survival and replication since it encodes a mitochondrial receptor for the pro-apoptotic protein bax  <cit>  and has been found to be a viral mirna target through which the virus promotes cell survival  <cit> . all together, it seems that aa animals are more susceptible to prrs due to increased viral entry and replication in these animals when compared to the more resistant ab animals.

molecular details on how prrsv and other viruses interact with the host cell indicate the importance of calcium, calmodulin, and iqgap in a prrsv infection. viruses often induce host cell cycle arrest to benefit viral proliferation by making the host cell environment available for viral replication, translation and assembly  <cit> . prrsv infection delays cell cycle progression at the s phase, and as a result there is an accumulation of cells at this phase  <cit> . similarly, rotavirus has been shown to hijack the host cellular machinery and push cells from the g <dig> to the s phase  <cit> . bhowmick et al.  <cit>  noted that viral gene expression was significantly higher in experimentally induced s phase arrested cells than in g0/g <dig> phase arrested cells, suggesting greater rotaviral replication during the s phase. this accumulation of cells in the s phase appeared to be ca+2/calmodulin pathway dependent  <cit> . rotavirus infection increased intracellular ca+ <dig> concentrations  <cit>  and the level of calmodulin was related to progression into the s phase  <cit> . bhowmick et al.  <cit>  showed that inhibition of ca+ <dig> and calmodulin inhibited this g <dig> to s phase transition. iqgap <dig>  which is regulated by calmodulin and is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, accumulated in the nucleus when cells were arrested in the g1/s phase  <cit> .

however, how aa animals rather than ab animals activate or prolong the use of the pi3k pathway and favor viral entry and replication remains a question. it has been reported that murine guanylate binding protein  <dig> , which resembles human gbp <dig> , can form a protein complex with the catalytic subunit of pi3k  <cit> . by binding to pi3k, mgbp <dig> inhibits the activation of downstream processes involving akt and rac <dig>  and thus interrupts the signal transduction pathway that otherwise could have been activated by external stimuli  <cit> . furthermore, the s52n mutation, a single amino acid substitution in the gtp binding domain of mgbp <dig>  disrupts its binding with pi3k  <cit> . gbps are large gtpases that coordinate the activation of g proteins by controlling the switch from an inactive gdp-bound state to an active gtp-bound state. three gbp proteins  contain a c-terminal caax prenylation motif, which allows the protein to anchor to cellular membranes  <cit> . mutations in the caax box prevent prenylation or farnesylation, which is required for the correct localization of gtpases and for the enzyme to become completely functional  <cit> . itsui et al.  <cit>  reported that the gtpase activity of human gbp <dig> was required for anti-viral response against the hepatitis c virus. fellenberg et al.  <cit>  studied an alternatively spliced gbp <dig> variant in human t cell lymphomas that misses  <dig> amino acids at the c terminus of the protein including the caax box and resembles the porcine gbp <dig> truncated variant of the aa genotype for the wur snp that was described by koltes et al.  <cit> . they propose that this truncated variant plays an important role in oncogenesis, possibly due to its loss of proper gtpase activity, and therefore formation of constitutively active, and potentially oncogenic, proteins  <cit> . although this has not been confirmed, we expect that the porcine gbp <dig> will be able to bind pi3k in a similar manner as mgbp <dig> or hgbp <dig>  because of the high homology between gbp proteins. we further hypothesize that the truncated version of gbp <dig>  as seen in the aa animals, will not be able to bind pi3k and thus not inhibit processes downstream of pi3k, thus favoring viral entry and replication. we believe this is a plausible hypothesis because our analysis of the expression data indicates extended expression of the g-protein coupled receptor  pathway in aa animals over ab animals.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to elucidate transcript expression pathway differences that can explain the association between the wur snp and host response to prrs. a whole blood rna-seq experiment was performed on blood collected during prrsv infection of carefully selected aa  and ab  littermates. the main difference found between wur genotypes indicated involvement of ion transport-homeostasis and the g-coupled protein receptor necessary for the pi3k signaling pathway, which is vital for prrsv entry. for ab animals, this pathway is already activated before infection and declines rapidly after prrsv infection, while in aa animals, a delayed response with regard to this pathway is observed until  <dig> dpi, after which it turns down. the mutation in gbp <dig>  which is believed to be the causal mutation for the difference in prrs susceptibility between aa and ab animals, likely influences the activation of this pi3k signaling pathway.
