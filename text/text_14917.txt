BACKGROUND
phosphorylation emerged as a major post-translational mechanism that is well suited for effecting a rapid change in the activity of a transcription factor in response to an extracellular signal  <cit> . during periods of physical or chemical stress, transcription of genes encoding cytoprotective heat shock or stress proteins  is increased. this enhanced expression is primarily mediated by heat shock factor  <dig>  in vertebrate cells or by a homologous factor  in non-vertebrate cells. hsf/hsf <dig> is continuously present in cells but is only activated when the cells experience a stress. it was long known that hsf/hsf <dig> is hyperphosphorylated in stressed cells  <cit> .

activation of human hsf <dig> occurs in at least two steps. a first step results in formation of factor homotrimers that are capable of binding so-called heat shock element  sequences present in hsp genes but essentially lack transcriptional activity. in a second step, these hsf <dig> homotrimers are converted to a transcriptionally competent form  <cit> . in cells exposed to heat, acquisition of hse dna-binding activity was observed to precede hyperphosphorylation of hsf <dig>  <cit> . this result suggested that hyperphosphorylation could play a regulatory role in the second activation step that renders the factor transactivation-competent. several additional observations are compatible with the hypothesis that hyperphosphorylation of hsf <dig> is required for or enhances induction of the transcriptional competence of the factor:  to the extent this was examined, all conditions that resulted in activation of hsf <dig> also induced hyperphosphorylation of the factor.  conversely, compounds such as salicylate, indomethacin, menadione and hydrogen peroxide that were only capable of triggering the first step of hsf <dig> activation also failed to prompt factor hyperphosphorylation  <cit> .  inhibitors of ser/thr protein kinases reduced, and inhibitors of ser/thr phosphatases enhanced, hsf <dig> activity  <cit> . for the inhibitors investigated it was found that they did not affect hsf <dig> dna-binding activity  <cit>  .

to date, stress-induced phosphorylation of hsf/hsf <dig> has not been comprehensively analyzed. however, phosphorylation of ser <dig> of human hsf <dig> was reported to contribute to heat activation of the factor by enhancing its transcriptional competence  <cit> . it was also proposed that phosphorylation of thr <dig> of human hsf <dig> may be essential for factor activity  <cit> . furthermore, several hsf/hsf <dig> residues whose phosphorylation repressed factor activity were identified  <cit> . in human hsf <dig> these residues are ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig>  the present study sought to combine systematic mutagenesis and physical analyses to provide a broad accounting of phosphorylation of hsf <dig> in heat-stressed cells.

RESULTS
validation of a transactivation assay for testing hsf <dig> mutants
in chimeric transcription factor lexa-hsf <dig> the dna-binding domain  of the 529-residue human hsf <dig> polypeptide is substituted with that of bacterial repressor lexa   <cit> . lexa-hsf <dig> is known from previous studies to be regulated similarly as hsf <dig>  <cit> . transactivation by lexa-hsf <dig> was assessed by dual luciferase assay of cells co-transfected with a firefly luciferase gene responsive to lexa-hsf <dig>  and a constitutively expressed renilla luciferase gene . reporter activity was expressed as the ratio of firefly and renilla luciferase activities. to permit the identification of mutants of lexa-hsf <dig> with only minor functional impairments, the transactivation assay needed to sensitively detect changes in transcription factor activity. to find out whether the assay had this capability under the chosen experimental conditions, 96-well cultures were transfected with different amounts of expression construct lexa-hsf <dig> . at amounts below about  <dig> ng/culture, reporter activity increased proportionally with the amount of expression construct transfected. hence, at these low dna concentrations changes in lexa-hsf <dig> activity were certain to be reflected in proportional changes in reporter activity. most subsequent transfections were carried out with  <dig>  ng or less of expression construct per 96-well culture. transfection with  <dig>  ng of construct lexa-hsf <dig> resulted in a 30% increase in total hsf <dig> concentration as estimated by western blot one day after transfection . assuming a typical transfection efficiency of 20–40%, this result implied that transfected cells on average expressed comparable amounts of lexa-hsf <dig> and endogenous hsf <dig>  hence, under these conditions, under which an exogenous hsf <dig> form was not or was only minimally overexpressed, the regulatory environment encountered by the exogenous hsf <dig> form was likely to be similar to that to which endogenous factor is exposed. this is a departure from several earlier studies relating to hsf <dig> phosphorylation, including one from our own group  <cit> , in which studies exogenous hsf <dig> forms were substantially overexpressed. a known result of such overexpression is that a significant fraction of exogenous factor accumulates as dna-binding trimers in the absence of a stress  <cit> . at the low levels of expression construct transfected in the assays used herein, this result did not occur .

alanine scan of lexa-hsf1
substitution mutants of lexa-hsf <dig> or flag-lexa-hsf <dig>  were prepared that collectively covered all  <dig> ser, thr and tyr residues of the hsf <dig> sequence present in lexa-hsf <dig>  transactivation assays were carried out to compare transcription-enhancing abilities of mutant and parent factors in cells that either had been exposed to a 44°c/ <dig> min heat treatment or had not been heat-treated. it is noted that this heat treatment resulted in only minimal cell death. results revealed that most mutants retained the strong heat inducibility of the respective parent factor . nine mutants  had an induced activity that was lower than that of parent factor by more than two average standard deviations . five of these mutants were only modestly impaired, but four mutants, s326a/t328a, t400a/sa, sa and t511a/s513a, had substantially reduced activities. mutants s326a/t328a and t511a/s513a were expressed to normal levels. however, mutant t400a/sa accumulated to a noticeably lower level, and mutant sa was cleaved proteolytically . these results suggested the possibility that phosphorylation of residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig> played an important role in activation of hsf <dig> by heat stress. mutants sa and s307a were about 150% and 50%, respectively, more active than parent factor in heat-treated cells .

residues phosphorylated in hsf <dig> isolated from heat-treated cells
in a first series of experiments, cultures transfected on the previous day with expression construct flag-hsf <dig> were pre-equilibrated with 32po <dig> and then heat-treated for  <dig> min at 44°c. exogenous hsf <dig> was immunoprecipitated using an anti-flag resin. in a stained, high-resolution tris-tricine sds-page gel , immune-isolated hsf <dig> appeared as two sharp bands and a slower migrating diffuse region that contained the most highly phosphorylated forms . protein from the latter region  was subjected to trypsin or trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion. phosphopeptides were separated by hplc, tentatively identified by mass spectrometry  and confirmed by regular and/or radiochemical sequencing. in subsequent experiments, peptides from unlabeled, purified flag-tagged hsf <dig> digested with trypsin, trypsin/chymotrypsin, or endoproteinases glu-c or aspn were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry . these analyses resulted in an unambiguous identification of phosphoserines at positions  <dig>  230*,  <dig>  303*, 307*,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  363*,  <dig>  and  <dig> of the hsf <dig> sequence . no phosphorylated thr or tyr residues were discovered. this analysis covered >90% of the hsf <dig> sequence. no information was obtained about residues 176– <dig>  202– <dig>  225– <dig>  241– <dig>  270– <dig> and 427– <dig>

phosphorylation of hsf <dig> residue ser326
based on results from the above-described alanine scan hsf <dig> residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig> were considered potential sites for regulatory phosphorylation. of these residues only ser <dig> was actually found phosphorylated in hsf <dig> from heat-shocked cells. not all residues that were identified as targets of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry and/or sequencing had been substituted individually in the earlier alanine scan. to rule out the possibility that an effect of substitution of a phosphorylated residue had somehow been masked or otherwise modulated  by other substitutions present in the same mutant, single substitutions were prepared and examined in the transactivation assay. all substitutions of phosphorylated serines except for the s326a substitution displayed heat-induced activities comparable to that of parent factor . the s326a substitution was only about 40% as active as the parent factor . to test whether substitution of ser <dig> affected not only heat-induced but also chemically induced hsf <dig> activity, the activity of the s326a mutant was tested in cells exposed to cdcl <dig>  induction by cdcl <dig> was found to be similarly impaired as induction by heat . note that this reduced activity phenotype was not due to a reduced level of accumulation of the mutant as evidenced by the anti-flag western blot shown in figure 1e. nucleotide sequencing of the entire s326a-coding sequence confirmed that it did not contain any additional mutation. furthermore, a second copy of mutant s326a obtained in a separate mutagenesis experiment had a similarly impaired stress-induced activity as the original copy.

rapid phosphorylation of hsf <dig> residue ser <dig> during heat stress
a phosphopeptide antibody  was prepared to specifically monitor phosphorylation of ser <dig>  heat-induced rates of overall phosphorylation of hsf <dig> , of specific phosphorylation of ser <dig> and of factor oligomerization were compared in the experiment shown in figure  <dig> . cultures were either not heat-treated or heat-treated at 44°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> min. hsf <dig> trimerization was assessed by native anti-hsf <dig> blot. as best seen by following the disappearance of the monomeric form, most hsf <dig> was or was in the process of becoming oligomeric within  <dig> min of heat treatment . for examining overall and ser326-specific phosphorylation, hsf <dig> was immunoprecipitated using pser <dig> antibody. immunoprecipitated hsf <dig>  and hsf <dig> in extract  were detected by anti-hsf <dig> western blot. to better resolve different hsf <dig> species, electrophoresis was continued until the  <dig> kda marker had migrated to the end of the gel . results suggested that unstressed cells contained a small amount of hsf <dig> that could be immunoprecipitated by the pser <dig> antibody . note that, as would have been expected, the most rapidly migrating immunoprecipitated hsf <dig> form was slower than the fastest species present in extract . upon heat treatment of the cells, amounts of hsf <dig> precipitatable from extracts by the pser <dig> antibody increased about  <dig> fold . this increase was essentially complete after only  <dig> min of heat treatment. overall phosphorylation as revealed by a shift from faster- to slower-migrating hsf <dig> species occurred more slowly and continued over the entire 30-min course of heat treatment . a comparable gradual shift to slower-migrating species was also observed for pser326-containing hsf <dig> species . thus, heat treatment appeared to result in a substantial increase in the level of phosphorylation of ser <dig>  this increase in phosphorylation occurred about as rapidly as factor oligomerization and preceded phosphorylation of most other sites.

heat-induced phosphorylation of ser <dig> was confirmed by a second experiment, in which hsf <dig> phosphorylated at ser <dig> was detected by anti-pser <dig> western blot. because of the low avidity of the antibody, hsf <dig> needed to be enriched prior to western blot. large cultures  were transfected with small amounts of expression construct flag-hsf <dig>  one day later, half of the cultures were heat-treated at 44°c for  <dig> min, and tagged hsf <dig> was immunoprecipitated using an anti-flag resin. immune-isolated material was then analyzed by western blot using pser <dig> and flag antibodies . recovery of flag-hsf <dig> from heat-treated and untreated cells was comparable . a substantially larger fraction  of factor from heat-treated cells than from not-heat-treated cells reacted with the pser <dig> antibody.

phosphorylation of ser <dig> specifically enhances hsf <dig> transactivation competence
to examine the effects of substitution of ser <dig> in an otherwise wildtype hsf <dig> background, use was made of an hsf1-negative mouse cell line prepared previously by mcmillan et al.  <cit> . analyses were carried out one day after transfection of expression constructs for hsf <dig>  substitution mutant s326a  and control protein β-galactosidase. first, it was examined whether phosphorylation of ser <dig> affected the first step of hsf <dig> activation, which step involves acquisition of hse dna-binding activity and nuclear localization. electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that hse dna-binding activities of wildtype hsf <dig> and mutant s326a were heat-induced to similar levels . nuclear localization was assayed by standard fractionation of cell extracts and anti-hsf <dig> western blot. comparable amounts of wildtype hsf <dig> and mutant s326a were present in the nuclear fraction of heat-treated cells . thus, phosphorylation of ser <dig> did not affect the first step of hsf <dig> activation. to probe the second activation step, i.e., acquisition of transactivation competence, hsf1-negative cells were co-transfected with the above expression constructs and with reporter constructs hsp70-fluc and rluc. cultures either were left untreated or were heat-treated at 43°c for  <dig> min and further incubated for  <dig> hours. transactivation competence was estimated by western blot of endogenous hsp <dig>  and by luciferase assay . heat-induced expression of endogenous hsp <dig> was reduced by 80% in the cells expressing the s326a mutant of hsf <dig> when compared to the cells expressing wildtype hsf <dig>  the transfected luciferase reporter was reduced by 50%. the greater effect on hsp <dig> expression is likely explained by the difference in rna/protein stability between hsp <dig> and luciferase.

discussion
the present study attempted for the first time to examine phosphorylation of hsf <dig> in cells exposed to a stress in a comprehensive fashion. although hsf/hsf <dig> is activated in cells exposed to various types of stressful events, in the interest of being able to complete a thorough analysis, we decided to focus on phosphorylation of hsf <dig> in cells responding to a single type of stress, i.e., a heat stress. our study identified twelve serine residues in human hsf <dig> that are phosphorylated in heat-stressed cells. eight of these residues represent phosphorylation sites that were not previously known, i.e., ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  phosphorylation of all residues previously found to be phosphorylated in vivo, i.e., ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig>  was confirmed. no phosphorylation of thr <dig> or any other thr or tyr residue was observed.

because the importance of the various phosphorylation events for the activation of human hsf <dig> could not be predicted, an effort was made to ensure that the basic transactivation assay used in the present study was capable of reporting even relatively minor impairments in the activity of hsf <dig> mutants as well as examined the exogenous hsf <dig> forms under conditions that differed as little as possible from those encountered by endogenous factor. although hsf1-deficient mouse cells were available and were used in later experiments, our initial goal was to identify mutants of human hsf <dig> that were functionally deficient in human cells. therefore, mutants were prepared in the lexa-hsf <dig> background, allowing us to test effects of mutations in cells containing endogenous hsf <dig>  because hyperphosphorylation was expected to affect hsf <dig> transcriptional competence rather than hse dna-binding ability, use of an hsf <dig> form identical to hsf <dig> except for a substituted dna-binding domain appeared justified. for obvious reasons, an hsf <dig> mutant with an impaired activity was not available when assay conditions needed to be established. in the absence of such a mutant, assay conditions were defined, under which reporter activity increased proportionally with amounts of lexa-hsf <dig> expression construct transfected. under the chosen conditions, exogenous hsf <dig>  was expressed at a comparable level as endogenous hsf <dig>  hence, these conditions also satisfied our second criterion that was to assay exogenous hsf <dig> in an intracellular situation that closely resembled that encountered by endogenous hsf <dig>  the importance of the latter criterion is exemplified by the previous observation that substantially overexpressed exogenous hsf <dig> is trimeric and dna binding in the absence of a stress, whereas endogenous hsf <dig> is not trimeric and dna binding under the same conditions  <cit> . in the transactivation assays used in the present study, exogenous hsf <dig> did not specifically bind dna in the absence of a stress.

the above-discussed differences between the transactivation assay used in the present study and assays employed in earlier studies provide a ready explanation for the observed differences in phenotypes of mutants sa and s307a. the latter substitutions  had been examined in a previous study by our laboratory and were found to be active in the absence of a stress  <cit>  . in this earlier study, hsf <dig> forms were substantially overexpressed, resulting in accumulation of homotrimeric factors in the absence of a stress. therefore, the experiments were only capable of assessing effects of mutations on hsf <dig> transcriptional competence. when examined using the assay of the present study, in which assay oligomerization of exogenous hsf <dig> forms is regulated, the ser <dig> and ser303/ser <dig> substitutions could be expected to be inactive in the absence of a stress, provided that the mutations only affected hsf <dig> transactivation competence and not also oligomerization. as shown in table  <dig>  this expected result was observed. in heat-stressed cells, however, the ser <dig> and ser303/ser <dig> substitutions exceeded the activity of the parent factor. this finding is consistent with a role of phosphorylation at ser <dig> and ser <dig> in down-modulation of hsf <dig> activity during a heat stress or, more likely, during recovery from the stress. such a role has been proposed previously by others . also compatible with this hypothesis is that, in a tryptic digest of hsf <dig> isolated from cells pulse-labeled with 32po <dig> during a 44°c/ <dig> min heat treatment, peptide 297– <dig> was among the most intensely radiolabeled peptides . this finding implied that phosphorylation of ser <dig> and/or ser <dig> occurred during heat treatment. hietakangas et al. recently confirmed that ser <dig> is inducibly phosphorylated by western blot experiments using a phosphopeptide antibody recognizing pser <dig>  <cit> . as ser <dig> phosphorylation may require prior phosphorylation of ser <dig>  <cit> , phosphorylation of ser <dig> is likely also heat-inducible.

the present study identified hsf <dig> residue ser <dig> as a dominant target of regulatory phosphorylation during activation of the factor by a heat stress. luciferase reporter assays indicated that phosphorylation of ser <dig> causes the heat-induced activity of hsf <dig> to at least double. the transactivation assays in which endogenous hsp <dig> was used as the endpoint revealed that this enhancement of hsf <dig> activity translates into a fivefold increase in accumulation of hsp <dig>  while our study did not address this issue, it seems likely that the observed five-fold enhancement of hsp <dig> expression resulting from phosphorylation of ser <dig> is physiologically important. a previous study demonstrated that a five to eight fold impairment in heat-induced hsp <dig> expression led to substantially diminished thermotolerance of the affected mouse embryo fibroblast cells  <cit> . phosphorylation of ser <dig> also appears to significantly contribute to hsf <dig> activity induced in cells stressed by exposure to cdcl <dig> 

our analyses suggested that, individually, phosphorylation of none of the other residues identified as being phosphorylated in heat-treated cells significantly contributes to hsf <dig> activity. the possibility was considered that phosphorylation of several of these residues may be required for producing a clearly detectable effect. although this possibility was not examined exhaustively, several combinations of substitutions including or excluding the s326a substitution were tested by transactivation assay . these experiments failed to uncover evidence for a functional effect of phosphorylation on residues other than ser <dig>  it is puzzling that hsf <dig> is phosphorylated on a number of residues  whose phosphorylation does not appear to affect factor activity. the possibility cannot be formally ruled out that phosphorylation of some of these residues may reflect artifacts due to differences in phosphorylation of exogenous and endogenous hsf <dig>  a more reasonable explanation may be that this phosphorylation may be relevant under conditions not tested in the present study. such conditions may include different types of stresses or different levels of stresses used to activate hsf <dig>  they may even relate to differences in the transactivation assays used that may result in preferential assessment of different facets of hsf <dig> activation. this latter explanation may apply to phosphorylation of ser <dig> that was previously reported to contribute to activation of hsf <dig> by heat stress  <cit> . another likely possibility is suggested by the fact that hsf <dig> not only transactivates hsp genes but also participates in the regulation of several important signaling pathways . phosphorylation of ser residues that appears gratuitous with respect to regulation of hsp expression may affect interactions of hsf <dig> with components of these other pathways and alter their activity.

in agreement with earlier work, heat stress induced rapid trimerization of hsf <dig>  the substantial enhancement of phosphorylation of ser <dig> that was induced by heat stress occurred within a similar time frame. this rapid rate of phosphorylation of ser <dig> was commensurate with what was expected for a phosphorylation event that was critical for heat stress activation of hsf <dig>  most other phosphorylation events that could be monitored by their effect on gel mobility occurred more slowly. hence, it was possible that some of these later events required prior phosphorylation of ser <dig>  however, that at least some of this phosphorylation occurred independent of ser <dig> phosphorylation was suggested by the observation of a heat-induced sds-page mobility shift for mutant s326a .

the present study provides evidence that phosphorylation of ser <dig> stimulates the transcription-enhancing activity of hsf <dig> but not its dna-binding activity. how this phosphorylation results in increased transcriptional competence of hsf <dig> remains to be elucidated. the observation that substitution of ser <dig> with neither asp nor glu reproduced the effect of phosphorylation on factor activity  suggested that the mechanism is not based on simple charge repulsion. perhaps, phosphorylation of ser <dig> induces a local conformational change that affects binding of a chaperone complex or another regulatory protein to the nearby regulatory domain that is known to be involved in repression of transcriptional competence  <cit> . alternatively, pser <dig> may be a critical aspect of a binding site for an unknown co-activator. identification of the protein kinase that phosphorylates ser <dig> in heat-stressed cells would be helpful for determining whether the level of phosphorylation of the residue is actively regulated and, if this were the case, by what stress-induced mechanism. unfortunately, a search of the sequence within which ser <dig> is embedded for protein kinase sites using the netphosp program  <cit>  did not provide any useful information about candidate protein kinases.

CONCLUSIONS
the present article is concerned with regulation of human hsf <dig>  which is a key factor mediating the transcriptional response of human cells to physical and chemical stresses and a coregulator of other important signaling pathways . hsf <dig> has even been discovered to regulate aging and age-related disease  <cit> . to arrive at a better description of the mechanisms that enable cells to respond to various stresses by transiently upregulating hsp gene expression, it will be important to learn about the extent to which phosphorylation of hsf <dig> modulates these responses as well as to discover how phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of hsf <dig> itself is regulated by stresses. furthermore, it can be expected that a thorough understanding of regulatory phosphorylation of hsf <dig> will advance our knowledge about what controls the interactions of this factor with other pathways as well as likely will, through the eventual identification of regulated protein kinases and phosphatases involved in hsf <dig> phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, lead to the identification of new connections with additional regulatory systems. the present study represents an initial contribution towards these larger goals. our systematic analysis of hsf <dig> phosphorylation in heat-stressed cells identified twelve phosphorylated ser residues, of which eight were not previously known. mutagenesis and functional experiments revealed that newly identified phosphoser <dig> plays an important role in heat activation of hsf <dig> transcriptional activity as evidenced by the fact that substitution of this residue reduced hsp <dig> accumulation several fold. phenotypes for substitutions of ser <dig> and ser <dig> were observed that are consistent with the previously proposed function of phosphorylation of these residues in hsf <dig> deactivation. although no evidence for functional roles of other phosphoserines could be obtained in this study, knowledge of the identity of most or all residues phosphorylated in heat-activated hsf <dig> should greatly facilitate further directed experiments to test the potential importance of their phosphorylation in the various processes and interactions in which hsf <dig> is known to participate. it cannot be excluded that through the use of different transactivation assays functions of the latter phosphoresidues in heat regulation of hsf <dig> activity may be discovered that escaped detection in this study.
