BACKGROUND
photosynthesis is controlled by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. of these, plant hormones have received considerable attention in the past in photosynthetic responses of plants. ethylene is a phytohormone that influences every aspect of plant growth and development  <cit> . it is synthesized by the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase . the response of plants to ethylene depends on the sensitivity of plants to the gas. conflicting results on the effects of ethylene-releasing compounds on net photosynthetic rate  have been reported. it has been shown to increase pn  <cit>  or decrease it  <cit> , but no definite reason has been assigned for this. it has been shown that the increase in pn with ethylene-releasing compounds was due to the increase in chlorophyll per unit leaf area  <cit>  or by greater light interception  <cit> . in my earlier report it has been shown that alteration in photosynthesis was due to the changes in acs activity  <cit> . the goal of this work was to compare stomatal and mesophyll effects on pn in response to ethephon treatment. for that, pn, stomatal conductance  and carbonic anhydrase  activity were recorded. to find a possible relationship of ethylene-mediated changes in foliar gas exchange parameters, activity of acs and ethylene evolution were also determined. the work was carried out in two cultivars of mustard previously shown to have different photosynthetic capacity  <cit> .

RESULTS
the effects of ethephon on pn, gs and ca were found significant in both the cultivars . ethephon at  <dig>  mm increased the characteristics maximally, increasing pn by  <dig>  and  <dig> %, gs by  <dig>  and  <dig> % and ca by  <dig>  and  <dig> % in varuna and rh <dig>  respectively. higher concentration of ethephon  decreased the characteristics in both the cultivars. the ratio of intercellular to ambient co <dig> concentration  was constant.

ethephon application significantly affected acs activity and ethylene evolution, and were greatest with  <dig>  mm ethephon . low photosynthetic capacity cultivar, rh <dig> was more responsive to ethephon than the high photosynthetic capacity cultivar, varuna. application of  <dig>  mm ethephon increased ethylene by  <dig> % in varuna and  <dig> % in rh <dig>  increase in ethylene with  <dig>  mm ethephon was associated with the increase in pn, gs and ca. ethylene evolution with  <dig>  mm ethephon proved inhibitory for photosynthetic parameters.

discussion
maximum rates of photosynthesis were found with  <dig>  mm ethephon. the increase in pn due to ethephon has been reported  <cit> . increased gs and ca values in both the cultivars showed stomatal and mesophyll effects on photosynthesis. mesophyll effects are characterized as a product of co <dig> binding capacity and the electron transport capacity. the carboxylation capacity determines the mesophyll effects  <cit> . increase in ca activity at the site of co <dig> fixation exhibited the enhanced carboxylation reaction  <cit> . the changes in stomatal conductance due to ethephon were to maintain stable intercellular co <dig> concentration  under the given treatment. thus, stomatal and mesophyll processes contributed to the increase in pn in response to ethephon. the ethephon-induced effects on photosynthetic parameters were mediated by ethylene evolved due to ethephon treatment. taylor and gunderson  <cit>  showed a relationship between ethylene-enhanced gs and ethylene-enhanced pn. higher concentration of ethephon  decreased the pn and gs. such condition of inhibition of pn by ethylene-releasing compound has been observed by kays and pallas  <cit>  and rajala and peltonen-sainio  <cit> . in all these studies ethylene has been attributed to the changes in pn due to its effect on gs. mattoo and white  <cit>  reported that ethylene affected co <dig> assimilation and the plant responded depending on the tissue concentration. on the similar lines, dhawan et al.  <cit> , kao and yang  <cit>  and grodzinski et al.  <cit>  reasoned that decrease in co <dig> regulated pn and was related to ethylene evolution. in the present study, low photosynthetic cultivar, rh <dig> responded more to ethephon than the high photosynthetic cultivar, varuna. in control plants, lesser ethylene evolution in rh <dig> than varuna was responsible for lesser pn. as the ethylene evolution increased with ethephon application, the capacity of rh <dig> for pn also increased resulting in higher per cent increase in pn than the varuna. an increase of 75% ethylene in rh <dig> due to  <dig>  mm ethephon increased pn by  <dig> %, whereas  <dig> % increase in ethylene in varuna due to the same treatment increased pn by  <dig> %. earlier strong positive correlation between acs activity and pn has been shown  <cit> .

it therefore, appears possible that the threshold value for ethylene with  <dig>  mm ethephon was comparable to that which elicits the ethylene-mediated hormonal responses, which differ with the cultivars inherent capacity of physiological processes. it is that there is some requirement of ethylene for optimum response. low and high concentration represent the two ends of an optimum curve, promoting at low concentration and inhibiting at high.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that ethephon affects pn in both high and low photosynthetic capacity cultivars, varuna and rh <dig>  in both the cultivars, changes in pn were due to stomatal and mesophyll effects. ethephon-induced pn was attributed to ethylene evolution. the high photosynthetic capacity cultivar, varuna responded less to ethephon than the low photosynthetic capacity cultivar, rh <dig>  the low pn of rh <dig> was due to low level of ethylene. the low photosynthetic capacity of rh <dig> could be enhanced to give higher pn through increase in ethylene evolution. however, for both the cultivars there is a range of physiologically active concentration of ethylene beyond which it exerts inhibitory effects.
