BACKGROUND
phytogeographers have long recognised the sino-japanese floristic region  of east asia as the world’s major centre of temperate plant diversity and endemism  <cit> . much of the potential primary vegetation of this vast region is composed of warm-temperate deciduous  forest, as presently found scattered in mid-elevation subtropical  china, predominant in low-elevation north china and the korean peninsula, and disjunctively distributed in the main islands of japan  <cit> . fossil pollen analyses have previously indicated that during the last glacial maximum , the habitat of east asian wtd forests in the northern parts of their range  contracted, mainly in response to increased aridification  <cit> . however, palaeo-biome reconstructions suggest that these forests also expanded across the large expanses of continental shelf  that emerged in the east china sea  as a consequence of sea level lowering by c. 85–130/140 m during cold periods  <cit> . in consequence, it is now widely believed that a near continuous belt of wtd forests spanned the ecs continental shelf during the lgm , connecting presently disjunct populations in east china, south japan, and the korean peninsula  <cit> . if correct, this land bridge may have served as a ‘dispersal corridor’  <cit> , allowing intermittent migration of most wtd forest-restricted plant species from the asian mainland into japan , and/or periodic secondary contact and gene flow among formerly isolated populations, possibly up until the last shelf submergence . however, there is accumulating but still scanty evidence that the ecs land bridge also acted as a ‘filter’ in selectively hampering or even preventing the dispersal of certain plant species, while allowing those able to tolerate the environmental conditions of this palaeo-landscape to disperse more freely .

support for the ‘recent dispersal corridor hypothesis’ comes from phylogeographic data of two wide-ranging and abundant wtd forest tree species of the sjfr . in both instances, there is a near lack of differentiation for chloroplast and/or nuclear dna sequences across the ecs, consistent with ecological niche modelling  predicting large expanses of suitable habitat for each species on the ecs land bridge during the lgm. by contrast, a high level of genetic differentiation across the ecs has been identified in several rare understorey herbs and shrubs restricted to the mountainous wtd forests of east china and south japan . in all of these latter cases, the estimated times of trans-ecs divergence based on chloroplast  dna fall into the early-to-mid pleistocene, suggesting that the ecs land bridge imposed a formidable barrier to dispersal during the last glacial cycle . however, all of these previous time estimates relied on a single locus, i.e., chloroplast  dna, which thus renders them subject to error from the inherent stochastic nature of the coalescent  <cit> .

the aim of the present paper is to re-examine the evolutionary history of one of these understorey shrubs, platycrater arguta siebold & zucc. , using a multi-locus approach. platycrater arguta, the only species of this monotypic genus, is a small deciduous shrub endemic to the mountainous wtd forests of east china and south japan, where respectively two varieties, var. sinensis and var. arguta, are recognized  <cit> . in the cpdna study previously conducted  <cit> , these taxa were found to comprise distinct phylogroups, whose likely vicariant origin was dated to the mid-pleistocene . here we use a broader sampling of p. arguta, and present additional datasets of two nuclear dna  sequence markers  and nuclear microsatellite  loci to infer a more robust divergence and demographic history of this species. specifically, our goals were  to provide a refined time-scale for the divergence of var. sinensis and var. arguta by fitting all four datasets  to an ‘isolation with migration’  model  <cit> ;  to quantify the amount of post-divergence gene flow between them while accounting for potential changes in effective population sizes; and  to model the species’ potential distributions in response to past climatic changes, specifically from the last interglacial   <cit>  through the lgm to the present day. we attempted to reconcile these distribution patterns with our genetic data to determine the role of the exposed ecs shelf as a ‘corridor’ or ‘filter’ during lineage divergence at the time of the last glacial cycle. finally, together with enm, the added value of three nuclear data sets allowed for more confidence in the interpretation of the supposedly contrasting population histories of each variety than was derived previously from a single dataset   <cit> .

methods
plant material and sampling design
we sampled seven populations of each of var. sinensis and var. arguta,  covering the species’ entire range in east china and south japan . ten of the populations  were analysed previously for cpdna  <cit> , while four were newly sampled . as p. arguta is nested within a paraphyletic hydrangea l., but with yet undefined sister species  <cit> , we arbitrarily designated h. chinensis maxim., collected from yandang mt. , as one of the outgroups together with other members of hydrangeaceae . voucher specimens of this species and all sampled populations of p. arguta are stored at the herbarium of zhejiang university .

molecular protocols
total genomic dna was extracted from silica-dried leaf tissue by the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  method  <cit> . the entire internal transcribed spacer  region of nuclear ribosomal  dna was sequenced in  <dig> individuals of p. arguta  and one individual of h. chinensis, following the methods described in  <cit> .

after preliminary screening of six low-copy number nuclear genes using primers developed by strand et al.  <cit>  , we chose the triose-phosphate isomerase  gene  for the full survey of  <dig> individuals  because this gene region was single copy in most cases and proved to be sufficiently polymorphic  <cit> . direct sequencing of tpi was carried out using the same procedure as described in zou et al. <cit> . chromatograms of its and tpi with additive peaks were further analysed by inferring the identity of the two haplotypes within a heterozygote through haplotype subtraction  <cit> . when the chromatogram quality did not permit this procedure, pcr products were cloned using a pmd18-t vector system  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. six to ten clones were sequenced per individual when sequences contained two or more polymorphic sites. the two sequences of a heterozygote were separated by comparing sequences of the pcr product and the cloned sequences. all haplotype sequences have been deposited in genbank .

all  <dig> p. arguta individuals were genotyped at seven nuclear dinucleotide-repeat microsatellite loci   according to the methods described in qi et al. <cit> . fluorescently labelled pcr products  were separated on a megabace  <dig> . alleles were scored manually with the aid of genetic profiler  <dig>   using the et550-r size standard.

nuclear dna sequence analyses
sequences of its and tpi were aligned and edited in geneious  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . for each gene region, we estimated haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  for each population, for each variety, and for the whole data set. tests for non-neutral evolution were conducted by computing tajima’s d <cit>  and fu & li’s d*  <cit> . in addition, we estimated fu’s fs  <cit>  and ramos-onsins and rozas’ r <dig> <cit>  to detect population growth. critical values for these statistics were obtained using  <dig> coalescent simulations. recombination was calculated as the minimum number of recombination events  using the four-gamete test  <cit> . all of the above analyses were performed in dnasp  <dig>   <cit>  and arlequin  <dig>   <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships of its and tpi haplotype sequences were inferred using maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood , with gaps  treated as missing data. heuristic mp searches were performed in paup*  <dig> b <dig>  <cit>  using the same settings as described in qiu et al.  <cit> . the ml analysis was conducted under the gtr + Γ substitution model using raxml  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . node support was assessed using  <dig>  ‘fast bootstrap’ replicates. the following species were chosen as outgroups: hydrangea chinensis  as well as h. anomala d. don and schizophragma hydrangeoides siebold & zucc. . the alignments and phylogenetic trees were deposited in treebase . in addition, we constructed haplotype networks for each dataset using the 95% statistical parsimony criterion implemented in tcs  <dig>   <cit> . for its, however, we had to increase the tcs connection limit to  <dig> steps to link the divergent networks of the two varieties. indels were treated as single mutation events, and coded as substitutions . population differentiation for unordered  and ordered  haplotypes were obtained with permut to test whether nst is significantly larger than gst , indicating the presence of phylogeographic structure  <cit> . analyses of molecular variance  were carried out in arlequin using f-statistics. sequence variation was hierarchically partitioned between the two varieties, among populations within varieties, and within populations. the significance of all estimated fixation indices was tested using  <dig>  permutations as described in excoffier et al. <cit> .

nuclear microsatellite analyses
measures of nssr diversity were assessed for each population, and across all loci, by calculating in fstat  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  the total number of alleles , allelic richness , expected gene diversity , and the inbreeding coefficient . differentiation between populations was computed in arlequin using rst <cit> , which assumes a stepwise mutation model , and thus may be more realistic for microsatellite data than other measures  based on the infinite alleles model .

overall population structure was examined using the bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in structure  <dig>   <cit> . this program was run  <dig> times on individual multi-locus nssr genotypes for a number of clusters , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , using a burn-in length of  <dig>  and run length of  <dig>  iterations. we used the admixture model without prior information on sample population membership and allowed allele frequencies to be correlated among clusters  <cit> . we plotted the posterior probability of the data  and the ad hoc statistic Δk <cit>  for determining the most likely k.

hierarchical amova was performed using r-statistics, and partitioned as described above. in order to detect genetic signatures of recent population bottlenecks in the nssr dataset, we applied two tests implemented in bottleneck  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> :  wilcoxon’s sign-rank test for heterozygote excess; and  the ‘mode-shift test’ for detecting a shifted, rather than an equilibrium, l-shaped distribution of alleles.

divergence time, effective population sizes, and gene flow
we used the ‘isolation with migration’  coalescent model as implemented in ima
 <cit>  to estimate population rate parameters  and effective population sizes  of var. sinensis in china , var. arguta in japan  and their common ancestral population , as well as bidirectional migration rates  and divergence times  between the two varieties. all parameters in the im model are scaled by the neutral mutation rate . for this analysis we jointly employed the present nuclear datasets  and previously obtained sequences of two cpdna regions . since ima assumes no recombination within loci, the ndna sequence data were analysed by using only maximally informative and nonrecombining blocks per individual as identified by the program imgc
 <cit> .

both ndna and cpdna sequence data were analysed under the hky model rather than the infinite sites model  as we regularly found some sites with more than two changes in these data sets . corresponding values of u were calculated as u = μkg, where μ is the number of substitutions per site per year, k is the average sequence length under study in base pairs , and g is the generation time in years , which is five years in p. arguta as observed under cultivation  <cit> . as substitution rates for this species are unknown, we assumed the following mean values and confidence intervals  in substitutions per site per year: its ,  <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <cit> ; tpi, 7 × 10− <dig>   <cit> ; and cpdna,  <dig>  × 10− <dig>   <cit> . the nssr loci were assumed to fit a stepwise model of mutation , with a mean mutation rate  of 10− <dig> mutations per locus per year. although the assumptions underlying this mutation rate are debatable , this rate falls close to the median of average values  reported for a wider range of plant species  <cit> , and has also been recently employed for other woody perennials  <cit> . the geometric average mutation rate of the four marker sets was used to rescale the ima parameter estimates from the combined analysis. the inheritance scalars were set to  <dig> for the nuclear markers, and  <dig>  for cpdna, the latter value reflecting the expected effective population size  of maternally inherited cpdna in a hermaphroditic plant relative to an autosomal locus  <cit>  . markov chain monte carlo  simulations were conducted for  <dig> steps by using a linear heating scheme and  <dig> metropolis-coupled chains with a burn-in period of  <dig> steps. to verify convergence on the same parameter values, we ran this analysis three times with different random seeds. only estimates whose posterior distribution dropped to zero within the prior intervals were trusted.

historical demography
to further examine the historical demography of each variety, we estimated the shape of the population growth function through time by constructing extended bayesian skyline plots  as implemented in beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . this coalescent-based, nonparametric bayesian mcmc algorithm incorporates multi-locus data to reduce estimate errors associated with single genes and increases the power to detect demographic dynamics  <cit> . analyses were performed for each variety across the sequence data sets  assuming a strict molecular clock. the mutation rate priors for each locus were identical to those used for ima. based on the akaike information criterion  as implemented in jmodeltest
 <cit> , we selected the gtr + Γ and hky substitution models for the nuclear and cpdna sequences, respectively. bayesian mcmc chains were run for  <dig> million generations, with a sampling frequency of every  <dig>  generations, whereby the first  <dig>  samples were discarded as burn-in. convergence of the mcmc chains was inspected using tracer  <dig>   <cit>  by visually checking that effective sample size  for all relevant parameters were well above  <dig>  skyline plots were visualized using excel.

present and past distribution modelling
to infer distributional changes of p. arguta since the last interglacial, we produced enms for three time periods  using the maximum entropy method implemented in maxent  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the distribution records included in this study, records were sourced from the chinese virtual herbarium , the national specimen information infrastructure of china , the kyoto university herbarium , and red data books for the aichi and mie prefectures of japan  <cit> . based on a total of  <dig> records , a current distribution model was developed using six bioclimatic data layers  at  <dig>  arc-min resolution. this model was then projected onto the set of climatic variables simulated by the model for interdisciplinary research on climate   <dig>   <cit>  to infer the extent of suitable habitat during the lgm and the lig  <cit> . the accuracy of each model prediction was then tested by calculating the area under the ‘receiver operating characteristic  curve’ . we note that the enm for the lgm explicitly accounted for changes in palaeo-coastlines  and palaeo-climate surfaces on the exposed ecs continental shelf  <cit> .

RESULTS
nuclear sequence characteristics
the its sequences of the  <dig> p. arguta individuals  from east china  and south japan  were aligned with a total length of  <dig> base pairs , revealing  <dig> nucleotide substitutions and three 1-bp indels. together, these  <dig> polymorphic sites yielded  <dig> its haplotypes  . for the tpi locus, only one or two distinct sequences were detected in each of the  <dig> individuals surveyed,  <dig> of which were found to be heterozygotes. in total,  <dig> haplotypes , ranging from 309 bp to 314 bp, were designated based on  <dig> substitutions and three small  indels . none of the loci showed significant deviation from neutral expectations for tajima’s d or fu and li’s d* at the species or variety levels . demographic tests of fu’s fs revealed negative but nonsignificant values, while r <dig> was consistently positive and significant, suggesting demographic growth . the minimum number of recombination events  estimated for its and tpi were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

genetic diversity, haplotype relationships and genetic structure at its and tpi
there were high and comparable levels of total haplotype  and nucleotide  diversity at the species-level , and the same was found for each variety , whereby each of the seven populations from east china  and south japan  harboured broadly similar levels of diversity . concordant with the previous cpdna data  <cit> , there was no sharing of haplotypes between china and japan for either its  or tpi .

for each of these nuclear markers, the tree topologies recovered from mp and ml analyses were similar, and only the mp strict consensus trees are shown. according to the its tree , rooted with three outgroup species, p. arguta was monophyletic  and consisted of two major clades corresponding to var. sinensis from east china  and var. arguta from south japan . in addition to these lineages previously identified by cpdna, the its marker revealed two novel subclades,  <dig>  vs.  <dig> , predominant in the southern vs. northern parts of south japan  but with apparent range overlap in the kii peninsula of south-central honshu . as can be seen from the unrooted its haplotype network , the chinese and japanese haplotypes were separated from each other by  <dig> steps, and the two japanese subclades by  <dig> steps.

the tpi phylogeny, rooted with hydrangea chinensis , had lower resolution than the its tree but still recovered all chinese haplotypes as monophyletic , and the same applied to the majority of those from japan . both clades, however, formed a trichotomy with a deviant clade  of the two remaining haplotypes  from japan. these latter haplotypes, which showed no distinct geographic distribution , occupied an intermediate position in the unrooted tpi haplotype network , yet with somewhat closer relationships to china rather than japan .

for both its and tpi, significant phylogeographic structure was obvious at the species-level and within each of the two varieties . hierarchical amova revealed that most of the total nuclear sequence variation was partitioned between them . nevertheless, for each variety , nst values were high at each nuclear sequence marker  , reflecting that the majority of haplotypes were population specific .

nuclear microsatellites
in  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations of p. arguta, we detected a total of  <dig> alleles across  <dig> nssr loci, with  <dig> to  <dig> alleles per locus. average allele number  was higher in china  than in japan , but allelic richness  and expected gene diversity  were very similar . within-population fis values ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> .

the structure analyses provided strongest support for k =  <dig>  both when considering the probability of the data lnp and Δk . with k =  <dig>  individuals from one population in china  and japanese populations formed a joint cluster, while the two varieties remained separate from k =  <dig> upwards . at k =  <dig>  five clusters were recovered in china  and two in japan , where most populations  comprised individuals representing both clusters .

the overall rst was  <dig> , reflecting strong genetic differentiation over all populations and within each variety . however, in contrast to its and tpi, the total genetic variance partitioned between the two varieties was relatively low , suggesting pronounced allele sharing. wilcoxon’s test and the complementary mode-shift test provided little evidence for recent population bottlenecks, except for three populations from japan  and partly depending on the test applied .

isolation-with-migration  analyses
for this analysis, largest nonrecombining blocks of ndna  sequences were employed together with the nssr markers and the previously obtained cpdna sequences  <cit> . the maximum-likelihood estimates  and the 90% highest probability density  intervals of the six ima-derived parameters are shown in table  <dig>  and their marginal posterior probability  distributions are illustrated in additional file 9: figure s <dig>  based on the geometric average mutation rate calculated , these parameter estimates were converted to absolute values of years or individuals . the split between var. sinensis and var. arguta was dated to about  <dig>  yr bp, with a 90% hpd interval ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ,295 yr bp . for the ancestral  and descendant  population rate parameters, both var. sinensis  and var. arguta  experienced a marked increase in effective population size  relative to that of their common ancestor  . peak posterior estimates of post-divergence migration were effectively zero in both directions .

population rate parameters Θc, Θj, and Θa refer to the scaled effective population sizes  of var. sinensis , var. arguta , and the ancestral population, respectively. mc-j and mj-c are the scaled migration rates forward in time from var. sinensis to var. arguta and vice versa. mc-j and mj-c are the probabilities of migration from var. sinensis to var. arguta, per gene copy per generation and vice versa. 2ncmc-j and 2njmj-c are the effective migration rates . t is the time since ancestral population splitting in mutational units.

all estimates include the per gene mutation rate u, which is equal to the geometric mean of the mutation rates of all the loci. Θc, Θj, Θa, mc-j, mj-c, and t are scaled by the mutation rate, while nc, nj, na, 2ncmc-j, 2njmj-c and t are scaled by individuals or years.

bayesian skyline plot analysis of historical demography
the ebsps show that both varieties maintained low but stable effective population sizes  up to approximately  <dig> – <dig>  ma, and appear to have experienced a constant increase since . while depicting a demographic trend over time, this analysis, however, cannot precisely estimate ne because of the very broad confidence intervals .

present and past ecological niche models
the auc value for the current potential distribution of p. arguta was  <dig> , indicating a good predictive model performance. for the present , these predicted areas mainly include the species’ known distribution ranges in east china  and south japan . further suitable habitat is predicted in central-eastern taiwan, but where the species is not known to occur. during the lig , the species’ potential range in china was apparently reduced compared to the present. also in the lgm  only small and disjunct areas are predicted as suitable in the wuyi/yandang mts. in contrast, in japan, the species’ current range is more or less similar to that during the lig , while during the lgm suitable habitat apparently contracted to the south  and the more northerly located kii peninsula . most strikingly, our lgm distribution model indicates almost no hospitable areas on the exposed ecs continental shelf, excepting those in the far east .

discussion
intraspecific divergence and post-divergence gene flow
our results provide strong evidence that the two recognized varieties of the wtd understorey shrub p. arguta in east china  and south japan  comprise reciprocally exclusive haplotypes for both its and tpi . this is concordant with patterns for cpdna  <cit>  and consistent with the hypothesis that chinese and japanese conspecifics diverged over multiple glacial periods without inter-population gene flow. however, relationships inferred from the structure analysis of nssrs with k =  <dig> seem to conflict with this interpretation, as one chinese population  clusters with those from japan . given the congruence between nuclear and chloroplast sequence data, the sharing of nssr alleles most likely reflects homoplasy and/or incomplete lineage sorting rather than admixture through rare long-distance dispersal and/or migration across the ecs land bridge. in fact, our ima analysis of combined multi-locus data  recovered only close to zero signals of bidirectional post-divergence gene flow between the two varieties following their estimated divergence in the mid-pleistocene, c.  <dig>  ma . although this timing perfectly matches the respective point estimate drawn from cpdna alone  <cit> , single-locus cpdna analysis suffered from a lack of convergence of the lineage divergence parameter , a problem that has been overcome with the present multi-locus approach .

broad-scale biogeographic history of p. arguta
according to kimura  <cit> , there were three main stages of land connections between the eurasian mainland and the japanese/ryukyu islands since the late miocene, with most of the ecs sea-floor exposed at about  <dig> – <dig>  ma,  <dig> – <dig>  ma, and  <dig> – <dig>  ma, whereby the latter interval includes land bridge formations in both the penultimate  and last  glacial periods  <cit> . our estimated divergence time and its hpd intervals fall into the period   <dig> – <dig>  ma, the so-called ‘ryukyu coral sea stage’, when sea level rose tremendously and most formerly exposed land area submerged  <cit> . based on these palaeo-data, and with no genetic indication of long-distance dispersal, the disjunct distribution of p. arguta across the ecs is implied to have resulted via vicariance, that is, the species was probably more widely distributed on the ecs land bridge in the early pleistocene, around  <dig> – <dig>  ma, while divergence was subsequently driven by population contraction and extinction through land-bridge submergence.

unfortunately, it is not possible to test this ‘early-pleistocene expansion’ hypothesis further using enm, as no proxy-climate records are currently available for time periods earlier than the last interglacial   <cit> . however, loess deposit and marine δ18o records indicate that both aridification and the influence of cold and dry winter monsoons in the northern subtropical areas of east asia were less extensive before the mid-pleistocene climate transition , c.  <dig>  ma  <cit> . afterwards, global ice volume drastically increased along with a change in the dominant orbital cycle from  <dig>  to  <dig>  years, resulting in drier and colder climates during glacial periods  <cit> . given that p. arguta is a moisture-dependent and drought-sensitive shrub, early-pleistocene environmental conditions may have still favoured a more continuous distribution on the ecs land bridge, whereas subsequent glacials would have prevented the migration of individuals between china and japan. indeed, our lgm distribution model for p. arguta essentially shows no suitable habitat areas on the exposed ecs basin, with the exception of the delta region of the palaeo-yellow river . we therefore conclude that the ecs land bridge acted as a formidable barrier to the dispersal of p. arguta during the lgm and earlier cold periods of the late pleistocene. however, additional factors, other than climate-related niche requirements, may have had a role in preventing, or at least hampering such dispersal. this is because similar  evidence suggests that the ecs land bridge served as an intermittent route of range expansion for most of the late pleistocene to counteract isolation between chinese and japanese populations of two widespread wtd forest tree species, namely cercidiphyllum japonicum <cit>  and kalopanax septemlobus <cit> . both are tall canopy trees with long generation times, large effective population sizes and high seed production  <cit> , and additional traits generally considered important for population recovery, such as a generalist  pollination/dispersal system  and vegetative reproduction . similar traits are largely absent or only moderately developed in p. arguta ; the same applies to other rare and narrowly distributed understorey plants of the same forest biome with likewise ancient  genetic breaks across the ecs . moreover, in forest habitats particularly, one should not dismiss the effects related to edges , which may either increase or decrease seed production and recruitment  <cit> . hence, species in the forest interior, such as p. arguta and other understorey plants, should be negatively affected by fragmentation; by contrast, species using edge or transitional habitats, such as the riparian-dwelling c. japonicum and the semi-invasive k. semptemlobus, may be favoured by fragmentation  <cit> . we therefore propose that  range expansion in response to the formation of the glacially exposed ecs land bridge is species-specific; and  predictions on the effects of this ephemeral land bridge, as ‘corridor’ or ‘filter’, have to account not only for habitat preferences per se but also for other biological features of each species, especially its recruitment properties.

inferences of historical demography and range dynamics in p. arguta
our results provide strong evidence that both var. sinensis and var. arguta underwent past population growth following their inferred sundering in the mid-pleistocene. this is supported by significantly positive r <dig> statistics for both its and tpi , and is also evident from the joint analysis of the four genetic data sets  with ima, suggesting a somewhat larger effective population size  in each variety compared to their ancestral population . we caution, however, that this estimate of ancestral ne probably reflects post-vicariant conditions, and thus is biased downward, as complex population dynamics within the ancestral population, such as contractions and extinctions, are not accounted for by ima
 <cit> . nonetheless, analyses of the combined nuclear and plastid sequence data with ebsps were consistent in showing a strong increase of ne in each variety from about  <dig> – <dig>  ma onwards . this is very similar to the point estimates of expansion times inferred from mismatch analyses of cpdna alone, that is, c.  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma for var. sinensis and var. arguta, respectively  <cit> . hence, the present results support our previous notion that this near-synchronized population growth may have been triggered by climate change at the beginning of china’s ‘penultimate interglacial period’ . this also accords with palaeo-climate data, suggesting that during interglacials since the mid-late pleistocene  the warm, wet east asian summer monsoons have intensified  <cit> . in consequence, this may have also led to an increase of suitable habitats for p. arguta throughout the warmer periods of the late quaternary. partly consistent with this, the enm shows larger and more contiguous distributions at least in northern south japan  at both the lig and the present compared to the lgm . although suitable habitats may have shrunk in east china at the lig , and in both regions during the lgm , we found no direct  evidence for population decline  and recent population bottlenecks . nonetheless, the enm suggests that potential glacial refugia in east china were more strongly affected by small-scale fragmentation compared to the situation in south japan  in general, and its southern parts  in particular, where such refugia might have even existed in nearby shelf areas. this inter-regional difference in glacial habitat suitability most likely reflects differences in topography and climate, and should have differing consequences for population genetic structure and evolutionary history .

contrasting late quaternary evolutionary histories of p. arguta in china and japan
in var. sinensis, there is a marked subdivision between populations in nuclear genes  , along with high haplotypic and allelic diversity , and the same holds true for cpdna  <cit> . together with our structure result of five principal nssr gene pools in this variety , all of these data indicate long-term population persistence and isolation over multiple glacial/interglacial cycles. with no indication of latitudinal range shifts, past population growth in var. sinensis  may also reflect, at least in part, repeated downhill shifts in elevation range during glacials, perhaps by tracking favourable humidity conditions as imposed by the east asian monsoon in areas of high relief  <cit> . over climatic cycling, such contiguous but localized range shifts along elevation gradients would have minimized bottlenecking and loss of genetic diversity, ultimately resulting in strong population subdivision  <cit> .

in japan, patterns of cpdna diversity in var. arguta were previously interpreted to indicate southward retreat during glacials  followed by expansion northward  during inter-/post-glacials  <cit> . however, the current nuclear diversity and enm data cast doubt on the validity of the ‘expansion-contraction’  model for var. arguta. for example, nuclear genetic diversity within var. arguta populations is more or less evenly spread throughout the distribution , and neither haplotypic  diversity  or allelic richness  show a significantly negative relationship with latitude , as would be expected under a scenario of south-to-north colonization  <cit> . in addition, the enm for the lgm indicates suitable habitats not only in the south  but also, more disjunctively, in the kii peninsula of south-central honshu . by contrast, large areas of contiguous suitable habitats were likely present at the lig , suggesting that opportunities for admixture occurred repeatedly during inter-/postglacial times, unless hampered by the spread of evergreen forest  <cit> .

both of these latter predictions are basically bone out by the current nuclear data, even though each marker suggests a somewhat different historical scenario. thus, the identification of two separate its lineages in kyushu/shikoku vs. central honshu, with an apparent overlap of range in the kii peninsula , is strongly suggestive of a two-refugia scenario and a narrow contact zone between the two lineages. interestingly, this putative contact region coincides with a well-known inter- and intraspecific suture zone of japan’s temperate flora and fauna  <cit> . on the other hand, the tpi data are more consistent with a multiple-refugia scenario, that is, haplotypes are largely restricted to particular regions and/or populations, while still showing a relatively small amount of shared polymorphisms, mainly  among adjacent sites . finally, the nssrs reveal extensive admixture in most populations , excepting those in kyushu  and central honshu , suggesting that, in marked contrast to its, the contact area is much wider towards the south.

this discordance among patterns of genetic structure observed in the four genetic data sets makes it difficult to specify exactly which historical processes occurred in var. arguta. this discordance  is not readily explicable by a single difference in marker properties , but likely results from a combination of marker features, with both incomplete lineage sorting and secondary admixture acting at different temporal and spatial scales  <cit> . taken together, we suggest that the genetic and enm patterns found in var. arguta reflect a relatively ancient north–south vicariant event during glacials , followed by more recent climate-induced cycles of range contraction and expansion/admixture, with the latter producing more shallow patterns of divergence in more southerly areas .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study providing firm evidence that the ecs land bridge acted as a ‘filter’ during the last glacials in selectively preventing the dispersal of certain plant species of wtd forest, such as p. arguta, even though a near continuous belt of this forest biome is thought to have covered this land bridge during the lgm  <cit> . our data emphasize the species-specific recruitment and range expansion response of wtd forest-dwellers to the formation of the ecs land bridge, and caution against an uncritical interpretation of reconstructed palaeo-forest biome data as guides of past range dynamics of constituent species populations  <cit> .

in addition, this multi-locus study strongly supports the two varieties of p. arguta in east china  and south japan  as genetically distinct units that evolved in strict allopatry since the mid-pleistocene, which concurs with previous findings inferred from cpdna alone  <cit> . however, the combination of genetic structures from both nuclear and cytoplasmic loci can better depict the history of populations, demonstrating that  each lineage has undergone refugial isolation and divergence; and  var. arguta likely experienced post-glacial admixture across a well-known suture zone. yet, the extent of the species’ overall distribution does not seem to have greatly changed over the last glacial-interglacial cycles.
