BACKGROUND
stachybotrys is a genus of filamentous fungi found in soil worldwide  <cit> . it can also inhabit damp buildings. it is mainly a saprophyte that feeds by degrading cellulose and other dead plant matter. however, it is related to cellulolytic plant pathogens including fusarium and myrothecium, and there is a report of soybean invasion  <cit> . stachybotrys has never been reported to infect animals. however, it does produce a variety of toxins that have killed livestock and sickened humans after contact with contaminated feed .

some recent studies have suggested links between stachybotrys-infested damp buildings and poor health. for example, stachybotrys infestation was correlated with a cluster of infant hemosiderosis in cleveland in the 1990s  <cit> , and several case studies have found relationships between mold-infested buildings and poor health . however, as yet there is no consensus on specific symptoms associated with long-term low-level exposure to stachybotrys, and any environmental study of its impact is difficult. one reason for this is that stachybotrys rarely infests buildings in isolation, but rather is found with other toxigenic and allergenic mold species  <cit> . another is that stachybotrys can produce potentially beneficial compounds such as the antiviral stachyflins  <cit>  and a cyclosporin immunosuppressant  <cit> . in addition, stachybotrys products have been shown in vitro to include both proteins, e.g., proinflammatory proteases  <cit>  and antigenic proteins  <cit> , and also secondary metabolites  <cit> .

the two most well-known classes of secondary metabolite toxins are the trichothecenes and the atranones . both are terpenoids, but they are not otherwise related in structure. the more toxic class, trichothecenes, is further divided into two subclasses, simple and macrocyclic trichothecenes, with the latter subclass including the highly-toxic compounds called satratoxins . of the ~ <dig> strains of stachybotrys that have been tested, all can make simple trichothecenes  <cit> . however, only a third of these strains can make macrocyclic trichothecenes . of the other two-thirds, most can make the less-toxic atranones. in fact, these strains are the only known atranone-producing organisms. a strain of stachybotrys that makes both satratoxins and atranones has never been observed, suggesting that these chemotypes are mutually exclusive. the hypothesis of the current study was that these two divergent phenotypes are due to the presence of strain-specific secondary metabolite gene clusters in stachybotrys.figure  <dig> 
the two toxin chemotypes of
stachybotrys. both atranones and satratoxins are terpenoid secondary metabolites thought to derive from the primary metabolite farnesyl pyrophosphate . box colors indicate each class of molecule and its specific secondary metabolite precursors: blue for atranones, green for simple trichothecenes, and pink for macrocyclic trichothecenes, which include satratoxins. atranones are diterpenoids thought to originate from cyclization of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form dolabellane, which has an eleven-membered ring  <cit> . shown are the structures of all atranones solved by hinkley et al. <cit> , as well as types of enzymes capable of catalyzing the two postulated reactions in the pathway. trichothecenes are sesquiterpenoids that are products of fpp cyclization. the pathway of trichodermol biosynthesis from fpp is known experimentally  <cit> , but there are no experimental data regarding biosynthesis pathways of satratoxins or other trichodermol derivatives. shown is a conceptual pathway adapted from  <cit>  and references therein. it integrates results from several trichothecene producers. enzymes shown have been functionally characterized from fusarium  or trichoderma . trichodiol is shown to represent several intermediates that undergo both enzymatic hydroxylation and spontaneous rearrangement to form trichodermol, which is the first molecule shown that contains the trichothecene skeleton, i.e., the tricyclic ring  <dig> -epoxytrichothec-9-ene . in fusarium, trichodermol is not observed. instead, the pathway after trichodiol diverges into a series of products substituted at c- <dig> of ept. there are two known trichoverrols  and two known trichoverrins , but the respective pairs differ only in the stereochemistry of the c- <dig> side chain. the satratoxin f/g skeleton is shown as representative of satratoxins, and roridin e as representative of roridins. omitted for brevity are the verrucarins .



to determine the genetic basis for the two chemotypes of stachybotrys and to compare stachybotrys to other trichothecene toxin producers including fusarium and trichoderma, the genomes of four cultured stachybotrys strains were sequenced and assembled de novo. two of these strains make atranones, and the other two make satratoxins. some global properties of these genomes are reported, most notably their richness of polyketide synthase  genes. the core trichothecene cluster  of stachybotrys is presented and shown to diverge significantly from the ctcs of other trichothecene producers, with a genomic context that appears to be chemotype-specific. finally, comparative methods are used to support the hypothesis that the toxin chemotype in stachybotrys may arise from the presence of strain-specific secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, including three satratoxin chemotype-specific clusters and a novel 35-kbp locus that has been named the core atranone cluster .

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of stachybotrysgenomes
the phylogeny of the four stachybotrys strains that were sequenced is shown in figure 2a. the strains include two species, s. chlorohalonata  and s. chartarum , which are distinguishable both by morphology and molecular markers. strains  <dig> and  <dig> make atranones, while strains  <dig> and  <dig> make satratoxins . the genomes of these four strains were obtained by massive parallel sequencing on an illumina hiseq  <dig>  for each strain, a separate 300-bp nominal genomic fragment library was constructed. these libraries were multiplexed in order to combine them all on a single sequencer lane. sequencing yielded ~ <dig> million 101-bp reads per strain after demultiplexing and error correction. each genome was then independently assembled with soapdenovo  <cit> , followed by protein annotation of each assembly with maker  <cit>  using a cross-strain iterative strategy. ideally these annotations would be supported by rna data, but the rna extractable from each of the four strains was too degraded to use for rna-seq libraries, preventing this additional validation.figure  <dig>

table  <dig> summarizes the genome and proteome assemblies, and for comparison also includes a finished assembly of the trichothecene producer fusarium graminearum obtained by sanger sequencing  <cit> . these five genome and proteome assemblies are similar in size, although those of the s. chlorohalonata strain  <dig> are slightly smaller than the three s. chartarum strains. except for the n <dig> length, the features of all four stachybotrys assemblies, e.g., their short introns and sparse repeat content, are comparable to the finished f. graminearum assembly. this is consistent with the fact that fusarium is known to be closely related to stachybotrys
 <cit> . each strain was independently assembled with abyss  <cit>  to validate the soapdenovo results. while scaffold n <dig> length obtained from abyss was reduced by  <dig> to 80-kbp versus scaffold n <dig> length from soapdenovo, total genome sizes were nearly identical. also, the seven gene clusters described below for the soapdenovo build were appropriately present in the abyss assemblies. specifically, in both the abyss and soapdenovo assemblies, the core trichothecene cluster had identical architecture in all four strains, and the other six novel clusters described were consistently either atranone- or satratoxin-specific.table  <dig>

comparative proteome content of stachybotrys two methods were used to estimate the completeness of the stachybotrys proteome assemblies and to compare them to those of other sequenced fungi. first, cegma  <cit>  was used to search the stachybotrys genome assemblies for  <dig> proteins known to be highly conserved in eukaryotes. by this criterion, each assembly is 98% complete, with identical completeness found for f. graminearum and the other two sequenced fusarium genomes, f. oxysporum and f. verticillioides, neither of which make trichothecenes. all proteins found by cegma were independently found by maker in the full stachybotrys proteomes, suggesting that the stachybotrys genome assemblies are relatively complete.

second, groups of homologs in the proteome assemblies were identified with orthomcl  <cit> . for diversity, nine proteomes were used: the four stachybotrys assemblies, the three fusarium proteomes named above  <cit> , and two more divergent model fungi: aspergillus nidulans
 <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae
 <cit> . orthomcl clustered these proteomes into  <dig>  groups, each containing at least two proteins. of these groups,  <dig>  contained exactly one orthologous sequence from each of the nine proteomes. using this subset of proper orthologs, a robust phylogeny was constructed  and proteome divergence was quantified by calculating pairwise sequence identities . the phylogeny matches both accepted taxonomy and a previous molecular phylogeny  <cit> , validating both the predicted stachybotrys proteomes and the orthomcl-based method used to identify homologs. as expected given prior analysis of stachybotrys genetic markers  <cit> , the proteome identities indicate that the s. chlorohalonata strain  <dig> is the most divergent of the four stachybotrys strains. however, this divergence is relative, because there is 98% proteome identity between  <dig> and any s. chartarum strain, 74% identity between stachybotrys and fusarium, and >99% identity within the three strains of s. chartarum.table  <dig>

figure  <dig> summarizes the distribution of homolog groups in the four genera. of the  <dig>  homolog groups, most included orthologs from stachybotrys  and fusarium . many groups were exclusive to stachybotrys  or fusarium . most of the proteins in the  <dig>  groups exclusive to stachybotrys lack known domains , versus ~65% of all stachybotrys proteins). a similarly low fraction  of fusarium-exclusive proteins include a cdd domain, so this result is likely not an artifact of the annotation method.figure  <dig> 
distribution of orthologs of

and
stachybotrys. this venn diagram shows the number of protein homolog groups, out of a  <dig>  total, in each combination of three sets:  groups with a homolog in any stachybotrys genome;  groups with a homolog in any fusarium genome; and  groups with a homolog in a. nidulans or s. cerevisiae which for simplicity are pooled as a single outgroup.



to infer functional trends in proteins exclusive to stachybotrys, domain enrichment analysis was performed . this revealed that of the stachybotrys-exclusive protein domains, those enriched relative to the domains of non-exclusive stachybotrys proteins likely have specialized functions such as mating enforcement , degradation of plant materials , and synthesis of novel secondary metabolites or other products . the whole domain compositions of the stachybotrys and fusarium proteomes were also compared independently of homology considerations . domain enrichment analysis revealed that only nine domains out of the  <dig>  tested are differentially present between the two genera. four cdd domains are enriched in the stachybotrys proteome relative to fusarium. two of them, fcbd and glyco_hydro_ <dig>  are also enriched in the stachybotrys-exclusive proteins described above. the other two domains, pks and pks_at, are respectively the ketosynthase and acyltransferase domains that are found constitutively in type i iterative polyketide synthases . in fungi, pkss are large proteins of variable domain architecture that are responsible for producing a diverse array of polyketide secondary metabolites  <cit> . each strain of s. chartarum conservatively encodes 35– <dig> pkss , which is more than any other known fungus and over twice as many as fusarium. this suggests that a multitude of secondary metabolites from stachybotrys remain uncharacterized. pkss also appear to play roles in stachybotrys’s biosynthesis of trichothecenes and atranones.

the core trichothecene gene cluster of stachybotrysdiverges from those of other trichothecene producers
many fungal secondary metabolites are made by products of genes that are found adjacent to one another in a single contiguous locus  <cit> . these genetic loci are known as secondary metabolite biosynthesis  clusters. smb clusters throughout the stachybotrys assemblies were identified with the antismash cluster prediction software  <cit> . each assembly contains 50– <dig> smb clusters , with predicted end products including polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and other classes.

in the simple trichothecene producers fusarium graminearum and f. sporotrichioides, the core trichothecene gene cluster  is a well-studied example of an smb cluster . the fusarium ctc encodes 11— <dig> genes, most of which are required to catalyze specific steps in trichothecene production  <cit> . ctc sequences are also available for trichoderma arundinaceum and t. brevicompactum
 <cit> . however, each of these organisms’ ctc encodes only seven genes. this divergence of the fusarium and trichoderma ctcs reflects the biochemical divergence of trichothecene pathways between the genera. most prominently, fusarium makes only products modified at backbone position c- <dig>  such as deoxynivalenol and t- <dig> toxin. in contrast, trichoderma does not modify c- <dig>  but exclusively makes trichothecenes modified at backbone position c- <dig>  including trichodermol .figure  <dig>

each of the stachybotrys assemblies includes a complete and identical ~30-kbp locusinferred to be the stachybotrys ctc . this ctc was manually defined to comprise nine genes, including putative orthologs of seven fusarium and trichoderma genes: the terpene cyclase tri <dig>  the acetyltransferase tri <dig>  the hydroxylases tri <dig> and tri <dig>  the transcription factors tri <dig> and tri <dig>  and a gene of unknown function tri <dig>  the remaining two genes in the stachybotrys ctc are novel, so they were named by convention: the putative pks tri <dig>  and adjacent to it the tri <dig> paralog tri <dig> 

the patterns of proteins coded in the fusarium, trichoderma, and stachybotrys ctcs  are consistent with both the divergence of the stachybotrys ctc from that of fusarium and the similar gene content of the stachybotrys and trichoderma ctcs, which share six genes. however, the divergence in stachybotrys gene order from the trichoderma ctc was unexpected, since the initial trichothecenes made by stachybotrys and trichoderma are identical. for example, unlike in trichoderma, where the tri <dig> gene is located outside of the ctc  <cit> 
, stachybotrys tri <dig> is located within the ctc. there is a single syntenic block between the two taxa containing tri <dig>  tri <dig>  and tri <dig>  and the relative positions of tri <dig> and tri <dig> are also conserved. however, conservation of these relationships does not extend to fusarium .

two additional results support the novel ctc architecture of stachybotrys. first is the fact that two independent genome assemblers yielded the same sequence. second is the fact that the recently-sequenced ctc of the macrocyclic trichothecene producer myrothecium roridum  has a similar architecture, including mostly-conserved gene order and the presence of putative tri <dig> and tri <dig> orthologs . the diversity of the ctc  is consistent with the hypothesis that it is a hotspot for insertion and deletion of enzyme-coding genes, in turn allowing for substantial structural diversity of trichothecenes.

most stachybotrys paralogs of fusarium and trichoderma trichothecene synthesis genes are found within the stachybotrys ctc. however, also identified are two stachybotrys loci outside of the ctc that contain paralogs of stachybotrys ctc genes. first, there is the satratoxin chemotype-specific cluster sc <dig> , which contains paralogs of tri <dig> and tri <dig>  second, the assembly of strain  <dig> includes a small scaffold  that contains only two genes. they have been named tri <dig> and tri <dig> and are paralogs of tri <dig> and tri <dig>  respectively. stachybotrys orthologs of other known fusarium trichothecene biosynthesis genes have not been identified in these assemblies. in particular, the trichothecene exporter tri <dig>  which is present in the ctcs of both fusarium and trichoderma
 <cit> , is absent in stachybotrys.

the results of the antismash run were compared to the manual definition of the ctc . in each strain, antismash detected a single gene cluster that included  all nine of the ctc genes that had been defined manually;  the five genes specific to satratoxin-producing strains ;  three additional genes ~2-kbp upstream; and  two genes 5-kbp downstream of the ctc genes defined manually. the three upstream genes have orthologs in f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum, but they lack known orthologs in f. graminearum, m. roridium, or any other trichothecene producer. therefore, they were omitted from the initial definition of the stachybotrys ctc. however, they contain oxidoreductase, aldo-keto reductase, and glutathione s-transferase domains, all of which are known or thought to have roles in smb  <cit> . thus, it is possible that these three proteins do participate in synthesis of trichothecenes specific to stachybotrys. the two genes 5-kbp downstream are unique to s. chorohalonata  <dig>  neither of the predicted proteins includes a cdd domain, and in both cases blastp yields only hits to hypothetical proteins from f. oxysporum and other hypocreales . thus, they were not included in the definition of the stachybotrys ctc.

the products of the core atranone cluster likely suffice to make all known atranone species. the hypothesis of this study was that the two mutually-exclusive chemotypes of stachybotrys were due to the presence of strain-specific smb clusters. to test this hypothesis computationally, the four stachybotrys genome assemblies were searched for loci that were present in both satratoxin strains but in neither atranone strain, or vice versa. the custom search strategy combined two methods, both based on sequence alignment. at the genomic level, four-way whole-genome alignment was employed, using mugsy  <cit> . at the level of the proteome, the sets of homologs compiled with orthomcl were considered. whole-genome alignment was needed to show genomic context, but in practice mugsy aligned some locus boundaries incorrectly, so its results were manually adjusted as described in the methods. overall, the search yielded a total of two atranone-specific and four satratoxin chemotype-specific gene clusters. the larger of the two atranone-specific gene clusters was named the core atranone cluster . this is a ~35-kbp pks-based cluster, and it has a nearly-identical architecture of 13– <dig> genes  in both atranone strains. the cac is complete in the sense that the genes immediately flanking it on both sides are not atranone-specific.figure  <dig> 
the core atranone clusters of the
stachybotrys
atranone-producing strains. the core atranone clusters are shown in the blue box. the other genes shown are chemotype-independent. atr <dig> of strain  <dig> is gray to indicate that it is a possible pseudogene, because despite its translation having ~90% identity to  <dig> atr <dig>  in the present assembly its exon  <dig> contains an internal stop codon.



it is predicted that the products of the cac catalyze most or all steps of atranone synthesis, starting from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate . this prediction is based on two observations. first, the cac is one of only two clusters exclusive to two relatively divergent strains of stachybotrys. second, the predicted cac products satisfy some key constraints of the chemical model for atranone biosynthesis  proposed by hinkley et al.
 <cit> . the hinkley model includes two characteristic reactions: the initial cyclization of ggpp to dolabellane and a baeyer-villiger oxidation near the end of the atranone synthesis, which converts atranones d and e to atranones f and g. in the cac, the initial cyclization could be performed by the predicted terpene cyclase product of atr <dig>  this prediction is based on the presence of the terpene cyclase motif ddxxe  <cit>  in atr <dig> and its high similarity to fungal terpene cyclases . the baeyer-villiger oxidation could be performed by the predicted product of atr <dig>  this protein contains the fxgxxxhxxxwd motif, which is specific to bayer-villiger monooxidases   <cit> . the high similarity of atr <dig> to the bvmo phenylacetone monooxygenases from fungi  strengthens the argument. although terpene cyclases are relatively common in the four stachybotrys proteomes, the bvmo motif is very rare. there is only one other set of homologs that contain the bvmo motif. however, this second set of putative bvmos has representatives in all four strains, and orthomcl groups it separately from the atranone-specific pair found in the cac in a chemotype-independent cluster that contains only glycosyl hydrolases, suggesting that its function is not chemotype-specific. taken together, all these data support the hypothesis that the cac’s products function to synthesize atranones.

of the cac’s other predicted gene products, the largest is the reducing pks atr <dig> . a blast search suggests that this protein is related to both fungal and bacterial pkss, with the best hit to an uncharacterized pks from aspergillus fumigatus. some other predicted cac products include four oxygenases, three short-chain reductases, an esterase, and a methyltransferase. these may all be involved in the various steps of atranone biosynthesis, although their specific roles must await experimental determination because the types of reactions that they catalyze appear frequently in the hinkley model .

antismash’s definition of the cac included all  <dig> of the genes identified by the alignment-based search method described above , plus two additional genes, one on either flank . the first additional gene is 2-kbp upstream of the cac definition and has an ortholog in all four stachybotrys strains. it contains an ank domain, and has blastp hits to hypothetical fungal proteins . the second additional gene is 2-kbp downstream of the cac definition and has an ortholog in strains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  it contains a domon_doh domain, found in monooxygenase proteins, and has a strong blastp hit to a putative monooxygenase in the grapevine pathogen fungus togninia minima . although it is possible that these two proteins have roles in atranone biosynthesis, they were not included in the initial cac definition because they are not specific to the atranone strains.

if the cac’s gene products truly function to synthesize atranones as suggested by this analysis, then how atranone biosynthesis is regulated remains an open question. no transcription factors or other putative regulatory genes have been identified within the cac or nearby. the closest sequence coding a chemotype-independent gal4-family gene is 21-kbp upstream. other examples of fungal smb clusters that lack internal regulatory genes are the alkaloid clusters of the epichloae  <cit>  and the penicillin cluster of aspergillus nidulans and other species  <cit> . however, a scan of the  <dig> putative cac promoter regions revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> promoter regions contain the palindromic sequence agacatgtct, which suggests that a yet-unidentified transcription factor is involved in the cac regulation. additionally, some cac products may be widely expressed and post-transcriptionally regulated. it was reported that most atranone-producing stachybotrys strains easily produce simple dolabellane derivatives in culture, but do not always produce atranones  <cit> , which is consistent with the hypothesis that some enzymes in this pathway are not regulated at the level of transcription.

the second atranone-specific gene cluster is named ac <dig> . it is smaller than the cac, spanning 12-kbp and containing six genes, and was not identified by antismash. unlike the cac, ac <dig> lacks any genes at one flank in the assemblies, so it may be incomplete. also, three of its genes are homologous to those of a second distinct locus conserved in all s. chartarum strains . the largest gene in ac <dig> putatively encodes the phosphate transporter domain pho <dig>  and another encodes an hlh transcription factor. two other genes yielded relatively weak blast hits  to cyclins and arrestins, suggesting overall that ac <dig> could be related to environmental phosphate sensing. because phosphate-substituted compounds are used in the synthesis of terpenes, specifically-regulated phosphate transport may be necessary for appropriate production of fpp or other atranone precursors. unfortunately, it is not yet possible to obtain a confirmation via genetics due to the lack of systems for genetic manipulation and recombination in stachybotrys.

gene clusters specific to satratoxin-producing strains of stachybotrys
a general biosynthesis model for the satratoxins has been proposed, based on the known structures of similar molecules . in this model, satratoxins and all other macrocyclic trichothecenes derive from trichodermol, first by sequential esterification of two side chains to c- <dig> and c- <dig> hydroxyl groups on the trichothecene skeleton, and second by condensation of the two side chains to form the macrocycle. based on their structures, the side chains may be polyketide products, although they would need to be modified by external hydroxylases to yield the primary hydroxyl groups observed. pks-independent reductases and methyltransferases may also be involved.

the whole-genome comparative method revealed four satratoxin chemotype-specific gene clusters, three of which encode the types of enzymes required for satratoxin synthesis . they are named satratoxin clusters  1– <dig>  in order of size. the two largest, sc <dig> and sc <dig> , are classical pks-based smb clusters. sc <dig>  is smaller and is not a complete smb cluster on its own, but it is found adjacent to the ctc. as shown in figure 4a and 4b, all three scs are at the borders of their respective scaffolds, which raises the possibility that they are located close to the ctc and can thus be easily co-regulated.table  <dig> 
summary of functions putatively encoded by genes in satratoxin clusters sc <dig>  sc <dig>  and sc3


for brevity the closest homologs, their e-values and levels of identity are identified only for stachybotrys chartarum  <dig> 



sc <dig>  is a 30-kbp cluster that contains ten genes, sat1-sat <dig>  the largest genes are sat <dig>  which encodes a putative pks with a conventional non-reducing architecture  <cit> , and sat <dig>  which encodes a putative protein containing four ankyrin repeats  and thus may be involved in protein scaffolding. the putative short-chain reductase sat <dig> may assist the pks in some capacity. sat <dig> contains a secretory lipase domain and is similar to the fusarium trichothecene c- <dig> esterase tri <dig> , although it shows even greater similarity to other uncharacterized proteins from fusarium  and aspergillus . the adjacent gene sat <dig> encodes a putative acetyltransferase, and so the two together may effect endogenous protection from toxicity in the same manner as tri <dig> and tri <dig> of fusarium
 <cit> .

antismash identified all ten genes in sc <dig> . it also defined the orthologous clusters as containing 4– <dig> additional genes: two downstream genes present in all three of the s. chartarum strains, two genes  present only in strain  <dig>  and one satratoxin chemotype-specific gene located 1-kbp downstream of sat <dig> . this flanking gene putatively encodes a  <dig> -aa protein that contains a peptidases_s8_s <dig> domain and has blastp hits only to hypothetical fungal proteins . this gene was not included in the initial definition of sc <dig> because there is no known function for peptidases in secondary metabolism.

sc <dig> is 20-kbp and contains six genes, sat11-sat <dig>  the largest of which encodes the putative reducing pks sat <dig> . the alignment-based method is in agreement with antismash on this cluster definition . sc <dig> is unique among the gene clusters described here because three of its genes are paralogs of genes from the ctc cluster . sat <dig> is a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase and a tri <dig> paralog, while sat <dig> and sat <dig> are complete and truncated paralogs of the acetyltransferase tri <dig>  respectively. finally, the cluster may be regulated by the zinc finger protein sat <dig>  which is most similar  to the lolu protein reported from an smb cluster of the grass-endophytic fungus neotyphodium
 <cit> . only six putative lolu homologs were identified in stachybotrys  <dig>  and one also flanks the ctc of m. roridum . taken together with the novel architecture of the stachybotrys ctc, these data suggest that sc <dig> may have originated as a duplication of the ctc and has subsequently undergone rearrangements and divergence in function.figure  <dig>

in contrast to sc <dig> and sc <dig>  sc <dig>  is a small 10-kbp cluster that contains five genes, sat17-sat <dig>  antismash agrees with the alignment-based method on this definition of sc <dig> . although none of the genes in sc <dig> encode a pks, the cluster itself is found adjacent to the ctc in satratoxin strains , suggesting that the two loci may be co-regulated. one of the sc <dig> genes, sat <dig>  encodes a putative mfs-type transporter which may have a role in exporting secondary metabolites . in fusarium, the transporter protein tri <dig> exports simple trichothecenes  <cit> , but is unrelated in sequence to sat <dig>  the four other proteins putatively encoded in sc <dig> include the taud hydroxylase sat <dig>  the methyltransferase sat <dig>  the acetyltransferase sat <dig>  and the cys6-type zinc finger sat <dig> . sat <dig> may be involved in regulation of sc <dig>  as there is evidence for cys6-type zinc finger regulation of other fungal smb clusters  <cit> .

the smallest satratoxin chemotype-specific locus, sc <dig>  is a region that is located in the middle of a chemotype-independent gene cluster. it does not appear to encode any of the types of enzymes described above, nor any other enzymes known to be involved in terpene synthesis. it also was not identified by antismash. as it is difficult to predict the function of sc <dig>  it has been included in additional file  <dig> mainly for formal completeness. in comparison to the atranone case, no unusual chemistry has been proposed for the biosynthesis of satratoxins that would more specifically inform as to the relevance of any of these four chemotype-specific loci. indeed, given the recent divergence of the satratoxin strains relative to the atranone strains , it is possible that sc <dig> or other clusters identified here are unrelated to satratoxin biosynthesis and are specific to these two satratoxin strains only by chance. this is a fundamental limitation of both the experimental design of this study and the comparative method in general. as with the cac, it will eventually be necessary to verify the function of these clusters experimentally. at the same time, a straightforward comparative experiment to test and refine the satratoxin model presented here would be to search for these satratoxin chemotype-specific clusters in the genome of myrothecium roridum, a more divergent macrocyclic trichothecene producer  that does not yet appear to be fully sequenced.

phylogenies for four trichothecene biosynthesis protein families in stachybotrys,and functional implications
four well-studied ctc proteins are tri <dig>  tri <dig>  tri <dig>  and tri <dig>  tri <dig>  which cyclizes fpp to trichodiene, and tri <dig>  which hydroxylates trichodiene and its derivatives in multiple positions, are the earliest known enzymes in the trichothecene pathway . both tri <dig> and tri <dig> are known to catalyze different reactions in fusarium versus trichoderma
 <cit> , resulting in two genus-specific series of trichothecenes . to infer the functions of these genes in stachybotrys and more generally to explore the evolution of the ctc and sc <dig>  maximum likelihood-based phylogenies were constructed of these four proteins and their paralogs . these phylogenies included homologs from stachybotrys, myrothecium , trichoderma, and fusarium. partial 18s rrna sequences are available for all four genera  <cit> , and these were used to construct a reference phylogeny . excluding the stachybotrys sc <dig> products and other paralogs, the topology of the 18s tree matches that of tri <dig>  and tri <dig> . however, the 18s tree differs from that of tri <dig> , in which trichoderma tri <dig> is divergent, and tri <dig> , in which fusarium tri <dig> is divergent. the tri <dig> topology may result from the fact that in trichoderma, tri <dig> is located outside of the ctc  <cit> . the tri <dig> topology is consistent with stachybotrys tri <dig> conserving the function of trichoderma tri <dig>  which is to hydroxylate the trichothecene skeleton at c- <dig> to yield trichodermol  <cit> . although no functional prediction for stachybotrys tri <dig> can be made based only on this tree, it is assumed that similar to the tri <dig> from trichoderma, its product lacks the ability to hydroxylate c- <dig>  since c- <dig> substituted trichothecenes have not been observed in stachybotrys
 <cit> .

three of the four tree topologies in figure  <dig>  mostly match the topologies of 18s , which may support a single origin for the ctc in the common ancestor of all four genera. however, in the stachybotrys paralogs, the 18s topology is conserved for the tri <dig> paralog tri <dig> , but not for the tri <dig> paralog sat <dig> , which diverges before myrothecium tri <dig>  nor for the tri <dig> paralogs tri <dig> and sat <dig> , which form the outgroup to all tri <dig> and sat <dig>  these results are consistent with gene duplication or independent horizontal transfer events occurring prior to stachybotrys speciation. furthermore, the clustering of tri <dig> with sat <dig> and tri <dig> with sat <dig> in figure 6b is consistent with the hypothesis that the satratoxin chemotype-specific cluster sc <dig> originated as a duplication of the ctc.

why are the chemotype-specific gene clusters mutually exclusive? the above analyses suggest that the presence of certain gene clusters may suffice to produce the strain-specific products observed in stachybotrys. however, the mechanism or selection pressures by which these clusters have come to be mutually exclusive remain unclear. chemotype mutual exclusivity in stachybotrys is not well-explained either by chance or by geographic isolation, because the chemotypes of ~ <dig> stachybotrys strains are known  <cit> , and there is no relationship between chemotype and geographic location. for instance, three of the strains reported here were isolated from the san francisco bay area with two of these, the atranone strain  <dig> and the satratoxin strain  <dig>  acquired from the same apartment unit  <cit> . this study also contradicts the hypothesis that both chemotypes have all the machinery needed to produce both atranones and satratoxins, but there is a strain-specific metabolic shunt at work minimizing production of one type of toxin or the other. it is possible that by unknown mechanisms, the presence of the atranone cluster and a strain’s susceptibility to satratoxin toxicity are linked. one way to test this would be to transfect the cac into a satratoxin strain and observe colony growth. however, currently this experiment is not feasible due to the lack of an appropriate model system. it is also possible that there is some novel regulatory mechanism at work that prevents the inclusion of both sets of clusters in a single strain.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study are summarized with a unified genetic model for atranone and satratoxin biosynthesis  that also incorporates much previous work by biochemists  <cit> . some aspects of this model are speculative, such as the location of the boundary between trichothecenes produced by atranone strains and those produced by satratoxin strains. although atranone strains are known to make trichodermol, it is unknown whether they can make early macrocyclic trichothecene intermediates such as trichoverrols and trichoverrins. due to the presence of the chemotype-independent pks gene tri <dig> within the ctc, it is speculated that atranone strains can produce trichoverrols, though perhaps not trichoverrins. an assay of this chemotype in atranone-producing strains will be critical to more precisely determine the functions of the putative satratoxin chemotype-specific enzymes identified in this study.figure  <dig>
