BACKGROUND
dental caries is a complex and multifactorial condition which causes demineralization and progressive destruction of the dental enamel  <cit> . streptococcus mutans, a member of endogenous oral microflora has long been implicated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease  <cit> . s. mutans survival depends strictly on a biofilm lifestyle in its natural ecosystem i.e., dental plaque  <cit> . dental plaque formation is important for its persistence since biofilms does not allow easy penetration of chemotherapeutic agents, permitting to cause resistance against antibiotics, immune factors and host-derived antibacterial agents  <cit> . the ability of this bacterium to produce  and tolerate  acids coupled with its property of synthesizing extracellular glucans allows its effective colonization in the oral cavity leading to the establishment of highly cariogenic dental biofilms  <cit> . extracellular glucans which are synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferases  play a critical role in the adhesive interactions of s. mutans and contributes to the structural integrity of dental plaque  <cit> . s. mutans expresses three different gtfs viz., gtf b, gtf c and gtf d. the insoluble and soluble glucan is mostly synthesized by gtf b and gtc c respectively. however, gtf c is known to synthesize a mixture of soluble and insoluble glucans  <cit> . these virulence properties thus provide a unique microenvironment for unobstructed survival of s. mutans in the oral cavity  <cit> . therefore, approaches to inhibit various factors governing the virulence properties of s. mutans, could be an alternative to prevent dental caries.

there are numerous anti-plaque agents that are known to reduce dental biofilm formation amongst which fluoride is a well-known cariostatic agent  <cit> . however, its excessive use results in side effects like fluorosis and hence its use is limited  <cit> . moreover, chlorhexidine which is considered as a standard anti-plaque agent have also been reported as genotoxic  <cit> . therefore, despite of the presence of a variety of anti- plaque agents, the quest for an effective agent still continues. therefore, the development of alternative therapeutic agents with anticariogenic properties and minimal side effects is a promising approach.

chemotherapeutic agents from natural products have proved to be promising source for the development of new drugs throughout human history  <cit> . recently, several studies have shown the feasibility of using medicinal plants as a source of chemotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral diseases  <cit> .

zingiber officinale , is one of the most extensively used herbs in the indian system of traditional medicine. many studies have revealed its numerous pharmacological activities, such as, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive  <cit> , antimutagenic  <cit>  and hepatoprotective  <cit> . furthermore, there are several other studies showing the antibacterial effect of z. officinale against a number of micro-organisms including s. mutans  <cit> . however, there are hardly any reports evaluating its anticariogenic potential. hence, in view of the current need of alternative therapeutic approach, we initiated our study to provide an innovative and comprehensive insight of the effect of z. officinale to inhibit various virulence traits of s. mutans.

caries induction in rats
to determine the effects of the cr extract and me fraction on oral colonization and cariogenic potential of s. mutans, a total of  <dig> rats were purchased. these animals were divided three groups; a control and two test groups . all the animals were fed with erythromycin water  and a regular diet for  <dig> days in order to lower the microbial load. to confirm the absence of s. mutans colonization in the oral cavity, oral swab was plated on msb plates. the animals were offered 5% sucrose diet ad libitum throughout the experiment in order to enhance the infection by s. mutans. on 4th day, the animals were inoculated with  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of streptomycin resistant strain of s. mutans , onto the animals’ molars surfaces once every day for five consecutive days to allow oral colonization. the treatment was given twice daily, by applying the plant extracts topically on the teeth of animals by means of a camel’s hair brush. swab samples were then taken from the surfaces of animal molars on the first day and at the first, third, sixth, eighth and tenth week’s post-inoculation. the samples from control and treated groups were pooled in  <dig> ml  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer, serially diluted and plated on msb agar plates containing streptomycin for total cell counts. the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> days before enumeration of colonies of s. mutans. the percentages of the s. mutans cells were calculated to determine its oral colonization in the animals. at the end of the experimental period, all the animals were sacrificed. the jaws were then aseptically dissected and sonicated in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm sterile nacl in order to dislodge the dental plaque. these samples of plaque were serially diluted and were streaked on mitis salivarius agar plates to estimate the s. mutans population. these plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> days before enumeration of colonies. all of the jaws were defleshed, and suspended in  <dig> % formaldehyde until caries scoring. all molars of the animals were examined under a dissecting microscope and carious lesions were scored by a larson’s modification of keyes system  <cit> .

the results obtained were analysed by student’s t test, with p <  <dig>  considered as statistically significant.

statistical analysis
the data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. the intergroup differences were estimated by one-way analysis of variance , followed by a post hoc multiple comparison  to compare the multiple means. values were considered statistically significant when p value was < <dig> . the statistical analyses were performed using spss  <dig> software.

inhibition of glucosyltransferases activity
the effect of different concentrations of cr extract and me fraction was assessed against gtf activity in terms of the synthesis of water soluble glucan  and water insoluble glucan . the inhibition of glucan synthesis was found to be concentration dependent in the reaction. however, the reduction was observed to be more significant in case of water-insoluble glucan. at sub- mic level , the cr extract reduced the formation of wsg and wig to approximately > 70% as shown in figure  <dig> . however, me fraction was found to reduce the same by approximately 70%.

effect on cell-surface hydrophobicity index of s. mutans
the hydrophobicity index  was significantly reduced in a dose dependent manner when compared with control. as shown, at sub-mic concentration , the cr extract and me fraction reduced the hpbi by 75% and 71% respectively .

biofilm formation by s. mutans
the cr extract and me fraction inhibited biofilm formation in a concentration dependent manner. the effect was tested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h to evaluate whether it could affect s. mutans in each phase of biofilm growth. the results demonstrated that the effect of both the extracts was concentration-dependent as well as dependent on biofilm growth phases as shown in figure  <dig> . the percentage of adherent cells under various concentrations of extracts was found to decline with every successive growth phase. at  <dig> h of biofilm growth, cr extract and me fraction at  <dig> μg ml− <dig> reduced biofilm formation by 50% and 40% respectively. at  <dig> h, 50% reduction was observed by cr extract and me fraction at a concentration of  <dig> μg ml− <dig> and  <dig> μg ml− <dig> respectively. however, at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, the percentage of adherent cells were reduced to >70% and > 80% at maximum concentration as compared to control group. precisely, biofilm formation was inhibited mostly during the active accumulated phase, initial plateau accumulated phase and plateau accumulated phase of growth.

glycolytic ph drop
as shown in figure 3a, the glycolytic acid production of s. mutans was significantly inhibited by cr extract and me fraction at a concentration of  <dig> μg ml− <dig> . in control, the onset ph  <dig>  was decreased to  <dig>  after  <dig> min of incubation. whereas, after treatment with me fraction and cr extract this acidic ph  was raised to  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. above all, the ph drop recorded in first  <dig> min of incubation  was observed maximum in case of control with ph values of  <dig>  to  <dig> . however, cr extract showed minimum ph drop with values  <dig>  to  <dig> . .figure  <dig>

docking studies on spap and brpa with different compounds of cr extract and me fraction
all the ligands depicted by gc- ms were docked into the active sites of proteins spap and brpa. of all these ligands, seven ligands from crude extract  and six from methanolic fraction  were identified as the best compounds depending on their gold score as shown in figure  <dig>  compounds from crude extract  were found to dock in the active site of target proteins spap and brpa with a range of 60- <dig> and 63- <dig> of gold fitness score respectively. whereas, compounds from methanolic fraction  were found to interact with a range of 60- <dig> gold fitness score for both the proteins. furthermore, in case of crude extract, thirteen amino acids  were found to be common for all the compounds in stabilizing the complex of spap protein as shown in figure 5a and twenty three amino acids  were found to be common for all the compounds in stabilizing the complex of brpa protein as shown in figure 5b. whereas, in case of methanolic fraction, eleven amino acids  were found to be common for all the compounds in stabilizing the complex of spap protein as shown in figure 5c and twenty three amino acids  were found to be common for all the compounds in stabilizing the complex of brpa protein as shown in figure 5d.figure  <dig>

impairment of biofilm formation visualized by scanning and confocal electron microscopy
sem depicted the impact of cr extract and me fraction on the activity of s. mutans to synthesize glucans and on the structural integrity of biofilm formed . in concordance with the aforesaid results the treated group displayed significant dispersion of cells suggesting reduced amount of glucan synthesis that would have otherwise resulted in adherence. on the contrary, the control sample as shown in figure 6a  showed apparent clumping of cells with chain formation embedded into the exopolysaccharide pool.figure  <dig> 
electron microscopy. sem  and clsm images  of s. mutans biofilm formed in the presence and absence of the sub- mic levels of extracts after  <dig> h of incubation.



however, the distortion of biofilm architecture of s. mutans was also analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . as shown in figure 6b, in the absence of treatment , the cells were aggregated with an evident chain forming pattern. however, unlike control, the groups treated showed apparent scattering of cells without any cluster or chain formation, suggesting reduced interaction between cells, resulting in impaired biofilm formation. however, the cells treated with cr extract were more dispersed as compared to the ones treated with me fraction.

gene expression profile
the expression profile of different virulence genes  of s. mutans treated crude extract and methanolic fraction was determined . the entire set of virulence genes was found to be down regulated after treatment. crude extract repressed the expression level of rela, gtfc, brpa and comde by 60%,  <dig> %, 85% and  <dig> % respectively as compared to the control. likewise, methanolic fraction suppressed the expression level of rela, gtfc, brpa and comde by  <dig> %, 59%, 68% and 54% 54% respectively. evidently, both crude extract and methanolic fraction suppressed brpa gene to the maximum  followed by the suppression of gtfc gene.figure  <dig>

caries reduction in vivo
after toxicity assays were performed, the animals did not display any behavioural or weight changes, neither any mortality occurred post oral toxicity assay indicating that cr extracts and me fraction were absolutely non- toxic. the weekly recovery of s. mutans cells over  <dig> weeks post treatment is shown in additional file  <dig>  it was found that there was significant reduction in the recovery of s. mutans from rats treated with cr extract and me fraction. however, cr extract showed slightly better activity than me fraction. furthermore, figure  <dig> shows the reduction in smooth as well as sulcal surface caries after treatment. the overall reduction in smooth surface caries was more pronounced as compared to the sulcal surface caries post treatment. cr extract consistently showed better anticariogenic activity by reducing severity of smooth surface caries to 80% , 83%  and 86%  as compared to me fraction which reduced the caries by 40% , 52%  and 66% .figure  <dig>

scanning electron micrograph and radiographs of untreated and treated rats teeth
the sem analysis of the rats’ teeth clearly depicted the demineralization of the dental margins in untreated group , while the groups treated with crude extract and methanolic fraction showed smooth dental margins as shown in figure 9b’ and 9b’ respectively. furthermore, the panels in figure  <dig> c, c’ c” shows the dental surface. it was clearly observed that in untreated samples , the surface has an evident biofilm embedded in exopolysaccharide pool whereas in treated groups , the dental surface was clear from any such exopolysaccharide projections as visible in control.figure  <dig>

figure  <dig> shows the digital radiographs of untreated  and treated rat teeth with cr extract  and me fraction . as shown in figure 10a, there was an evident black space  that corresponded to a carious lesion whereas, 10b was the flipped side of the jaw showing the caries lesion reaching to the pulp cavity revealed by a v- lining surrounding the bottom of the tooth. this concavity reaching to the pulp of the tooth corresponded to an inflamed and infective condition known as pulpitis. however, in 10c and 10e, there was no such space or spot seen that confirmed the absence of caries. furthermore, 9d and 9f show normal radiograph without any sign of pulpitis which could have been sequelae of dental caries. the line extending downwards are the roots of the teeth and should not be confused with inflammation of the pulp, as they are not surrounding the root of the tooth in a v- shape pattern. all these radiographs were confirmed by an expert of the field.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study offers in vitro and in vivo experimental evidences that the cr extract and me fraction of z. officinale show exceptional anticariogenic potential. the gc- ms analysis of these extracts showed that there are numerous phytochemicals that are common in cr extract and me fraction, which could be accounted for me fraction activity being comparable to that of cr extract.

from the results obtained, the mic value of cr extract and me fraction against s. mutans was quite significant  <cit> . also, in kinetic killing assay, both these extracts resulted in a rapid decrease of bacterial viable counts even at low concentrations suggesting that these extracts can be delivered in low but effective concentrations in the oral cavity to inhibit dental caries.

furthermore, it is well documented that adherence is one of the most important step in establishment of dental caries and its inhibition could be a strong step against the impairment of its virulence  <cit> . the sucrose-independent  adherence is usually because of hydrophobic interactions between the cells and the adhering surface. as per the results obtained, there is reduction in si adherence as well as hydrophobicity. because of the reduced hydrophobic interactions between the cells and the surface, bacteria were unable to adhere. thus, the reduction in hydrophobicity could be directly co- related with the reduction in si adherence. sucrose dependent adherence, on the other hand, is mediated via synthesis of glucans. gtfase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of sucrose to sticky glucans, which promotes the adherence of s. mutans to the surface of the tooth. hence, sd adherence depends upon glucan production. it is evident from the results that cr extract and me fraction reduced the glucan synthesis in addition to sd adherence, as flavonoids are known to have anti- gtfase activity  <cit> . as higher amount of insoluble glucans in the matrix is directly associated with increased cariogenicity in humans  <cit> , the inhibition he synthesis of water insoluble glucan  will lead to an altered exopolysaccharide matrix resulting in ineffective adherence. another important event in pathogenesis of s. mutans is the formation of biofilm which is also mediated by glucans. the reduction in water insoluble glucan  will result in a considerable reduction of biofilm formation as it will interfere with the pathogenesis by disrupting physical integrity and stability, reducing the availability of binding sites for s. mutans  <cit> . as per the results obtained, cr extract and me fraction reduced biofilm formation during different growth phases i.e., in initial attachment phase , active accumulated phase , initial plateau accumulated phase  and plateau accumulated phase , suggesting not only the inhibition of biofilm formation but also its maturation at critical developmental stages. hence, based on these results, it is apparent that cr extract and me fraction could inhibit the gtf activity of s. mutans and thereby the bacterial adherence, signifying their potential to modulate the development and accumulation of s. mutans dental biofilms .

the results obtained from glycolytic ph drop showed inhibitory activity of the extracts against acidogenicity, marked by a tremendous reduction in the initial and final rate of the ph. this reduction in acidic value of ph could be directly co-related to the inhibition of the bacterial glycolytic enzymes. furthermore, since the final ph values in glycolytic ph-drop assay stand for acid tolerance  <cit> , the reduction in these values indicate the disruption of aciduracity potential as well. s. mutans by fact, is an aciduric bacteria which can carry out glycolysis at extremely low ph values. this is because the bacteria are able to maintain ph homeostasis across the cell membrane, which maintain the cytoplasmic alkalinity  <cit> . this aciduracity is mainly attributed by f- atpase proton pump by maintaining ph gradient across the membrane  <cit> . the reduction in f- atpase proton pump function by cr extract and me fraction is evident from the data obtained. thus, its suppression may contribute to rise in cytoplasmic acidity resulting in decreased acid adaptation. cytoplasmic acidity will therefore lead to the impairment of functioning of a series of enzymes involved in physiological processes like glycolysis, cell persistence, ips and eps production, resulting in potential mortal effect on s. mutans  <cit> .

the inhibitory role of the extracts  against ag i/ii or spap showed a moderate suppression of protein expression. as this surface antigen is known to critically induce bacterial adhesion  <cit> , its reduction could be an alternate approach to combat dental caries.

the clsm and scanning electron micrographs demonstrated the difference in architecture of the biofilm in control and treated samples. the apparent scattering of cells in treated samples can be related to the inhibition of glucan synthesis. this observation was further supported by the scanning electron microscopy. unlike the untreated cells, entrenched in the sticky glucan pool, the treated cells had only traces of glucan resulting in cell dispersion and reduced cell to cell signalling, consequently obliterating the structural integrity of a biofilm. the reduction in the glucan synthesis however also confirmed the inhibition of gtfs activity.

additionally, the expression profile showed that entire set of virulent genes were down regulated in the presence of crude extract and methanolic fraction. gene rela, is known to be involved in the oxidative stress and acid tolerance mechanisms of s. mutans  <cit>  whereas, brpa plays a critical role in formation of biofilm and its structural integrity. the repression of these genes will therefore lead to impaired acid tolerance and major structural defects in biofilm formation and integrity respectively, resulting in despaired virulence expressions. in addition, gtfc, catalyse the synthesis of water soluble and water insoluble glucan from sucrose. the reduction in the expression of this gene will thereby suppress the cascades involved in biofilm formation, cell wall integrity, adhesion promotion and surface biogenesis. the regulatory gene comde, is a part of the quorum-sensing cascade of s. mutans  <cit> . the downregulation of this gene will attenuate the internal communication system utilized by the bacteria to alter their gene expression at a critical cell density, which may even lead to cell death.

hence, the overall effect of cr extract and me fraction is evidently anticariogenic as shown by in vitro studies. however, the complexity of the bacteria-host interaction leads us to the use of animal models, where caries lesions can be studied under controlled conditions. in vivo studies demonstrated that the daily topical exposure these extracts dramatically affected the ability of s. mutans to colonize on the tooth surfaces, consequently inhibiting the development of smooth surface caries and, to a lesser extent, sulcal surface carious lesions. the results obtained specify that the active compounds are available at efficacious concentrations in oral cavity despite of their brief exposure due to salivary clearance. it is known that the persistence of a therapeutic effect of topically applied agent in the oral cavity is a highly desirable in the development of chemotherapeutic approaches against dental caries  <cit> . the in vivo results  may again be related to the effective inhibition of gtf activity and on bacterial glycolytic pathway which would reduce the pathogenicity of s. mutans in vivo. our results are in harmony with a previous study which showed that a pronounced reduction in smooth-surface caries than the incidence of sulcal caries were observed in rats infected with s. mutans mutants defective in the production of either one or both gtfs  <cit> . the in vivo effects of these extracts  are also validated with scanning electron micrographs and digital radiographs evidently showing reduced demineralization and a healthy pulp without any sequelae of dental caries . however, certain limitations can be overcome in the future studies that include the purification of pure compounds from the extracts. also, instead of studying only s. mutans , certain other oral micro- organisms  that play a significant role in the prevalence of dental caries can also be studied.

however, as compared to our previous study which evaluated the potential of emblica officinalis against cariogenic properties of s. mutans  <cit> , the present study bears an upper hand. all the cariogenic factors that were evaluated in both these studies were evidently more reduced by z.officinale than e. officinalis. additionally, this study proves to be novel over the previous study  <cit> , as it is extended to in vivo studies validating the in vitro results that showed z. officinale to be a potential anticariogenic agent.

hence, the study clearly indicates that cr extract and me fraction of z. officinale possess immense cariostatic potential. furthermore, its non-toxic nature makes it more alluring for the development of novel anti-caries therapeutic agent.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has investigated the effect of crude extract and methanolic fraction of z. officinale against virulence properties of s. mutans. it reflects a prospective role of z. officinale as a potential therapeutic agent against virulence traits of s. mutans. hence, it can be a promising prophylactic therapeutic agent for dental caries.
