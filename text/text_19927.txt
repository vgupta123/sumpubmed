BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum  is a well known phytopathogenic fungus associated with fusarium head blight  disease, which causes blights, root rots, or wilts, especially in economically important cereal crops such as wheat, maize, and barley  <cit> . fhb is considered an important fungal disease because it drastically reduces grain yield and quality, and produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol  and nivalenol  in cereals, which are very harmful to human and animal health  <cit> . the fungus can also infect several dicotyledonous plants including arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato, and soybean  <cit> .

viruses that infect plant fungi are referred to as mycoviruses. infection by some mycoviruses confers hypovirulence by attenuating pathogenicity to their fungal hosts, which are mostly plant pathogens. mycoviruses tend to be double-stranded rna  viruses  <cit> , and several fusarium-infecting mycoviruses have been isolated  <cit> . in addition, several whole genome sequences of dsrna mycoviruses strains derived from f. graminearum have recently been reported  <cit> .

in many cases, such as those of f. poae   <cit>  and f. solani , viral infection is not associated with phenotypic changes  <cit> . however, fusarium graminearum virus  <dig> strain-dk <dig>  exhibits interesting phenotypes including reduced mycelial growth and the induction of dark red pigmentation  <cit> . several previous studies have provided strong evidence that hypovirulent mycoviruses could be used as substitutes for fungicides  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that protoplast fusion is the most efficient approach for transmitting mycoviruses among a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi and that this approach will facilitate the use of mycoviruses as a biocontrol agent  <cit> .

with the increasing availability of whole genome sequences for representative plant fungal pathogens  <cit> , extensive and diverse genome-wide analyses can be performed, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics  <cit> . proteomics approaches for different fusarium species have enabled examinations of extracellular proteins, proteins involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, and proteome profiles upon antagonistic rhizobacteria inoculation and mycovirus infection  <cit> . several gene expression analyses based on microarrays have also been conducted  <cit> . for example, genome-wide expression profiling of f. graminearum was carried out to examine responses to treatment with azole fungicide tebuconazole and during perithecium development  <cit> . microarrays provide a valuable tool for detecting and identifying fusarium species that produce specific metabolites such as trichothecene and moniliformin  <cit> . moreover, the recently completed genome sequencing of three major fusarium species provides an important resource for studying pathogenicity and functions of individual genes  <cit> .

several microarray-based studies have demonstrated transcriptional changes in fungal genes following mycovirus infection, although most of these studies examined only chv1- <dig> infecting the chestnut blight fungus cryphonectria parasitica. initially, a polymerase chain reaction -based approach demonstrated that elevation of camp levels by chv1- <dig> resulted in reduced accumulation of the gtp-binding  protein subunit cpg- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, cdna microarrays containing  <dig>  genes from c. parasitica showed transcriptional change in g-signaling pathways following hypovirus infections showing different virulence or phenotypes  <cit> .

infection by a virus leads to changes in diverse biological processes between fungal host and viral factors. it is of interest to examine such alterations at the molecular level. however, no previous reports have examined expression differences between a fungus containing a mycovirus and an infected parent, aside from two papers that used microarray cdna chips based on expressed sequence tags to examine fungal host gene expression upon mycovirus infection  <cit> . here, we examined genome-wide transcriptional differences in f. graminearum expression between a strain harboring fgv1-dk <dig> and its uninfected parent. this is the first report of a genome-wide fungal gene expression analysis during mycovirus infection using a 3′ tiling microarray, and our findings show global differences in host cellular pathways in f. graminearum harboring fgv1-dk <dig> 

RESULTS
genome-wide 3′-tiling microarray to identify differentially expressed genes in f. graminearum harboring fgv1-dk21
the virus-infected f. graminearum exhibited strong inhibition of mycelia growth as well as reduced levels of don at  <dig> days after inoculation . to visualize how gene expression patterns were affected at different time points, we generated scatterplots . interestingly, the scatterplots showed that there were no significant differences in the number of differentially expressed genes between  <dig> h and  <dig> h; however, it appeared that the changes in gene expression at  <dig> h were somewhat more extensive than those at  <dig> h . to identify differentially expressed genes, we first performed hierarchical clustering, which identified gene sets of significantly differentially expressed genes at two different time points . most of the identified genes showed at least two-fold differential expression. a total of  <dig> genes, representing  <dig> % of  <dig>  genes, were differentially expressed at both time points , with  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  identified as differentially expressed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively . moreover,  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed at both time points .

we further analyzed the lists of differentially expressed genes according to those down-regulated vs. those up-regulated . genes with an adjusted p-value less than  <dig>  were selected as differentially expressed genes. in both time points,  <dig> genes  were down-regulated whereas  <dig> genes  were up-regulated . among the down-regulated genes, there were more differentially expressed genes at  <dig> h  than at  <dig> h  . in contrast, more genes were induced at  <dig> h  than at  <dig> h  . moreover,  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were commonly found in the group of down-regulated and up-regulated genes, respectively . we then investigated the expression patterns of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed at both time points using hierarchical clustering, which sorted the genes into four groups according to expression patterns . group a contained  <dig> genes that were highly down-regulated at  <dig> h but were up-regulated at  <dig> h. in contrast, the  <dig> genes belonging to group b were highly induced at  <dig> h, and subsequently down-regulated . group c included  <dig> genes that were strongly repressed regardless of virus infection time, and group d contained  <dig> genes that showed consistently elevated gene expression across both time points.

representative genes showing significant expression change and real-time validation of the microarray data by quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr
representative fungal genes that showed significant gene expression are listed in table  <dig>  at  <dig> h, several genes encoding enzymes including phospholipase/carboxylesterase, polyketide synthase, eukaryotic aspartyl protease and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases were highly induced, whereas transcripts involved in transport, such as amino acid transporter permease and abc transporter, were up-regulated at  <dig> h . in contrast, several of the repressed genes at  <dig> h included maltose transporter, linoleate diol synthase, and genes with unknown functions, whereas those encoding ferric reductase and abhydrolase  <dig> were strongly repressed at  <dig> h .

to validate the microarray data, we selected  <dig> genes whose expression was significantly affected in the host containing fgv1-dk <dig>  as demonstrated by the microarray analysis, and determined their relative expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  . genes that showed diverse expression patterns were categorized into different functional classes . the results of the qrt-pcr were highly consistent with those of the microarray data. for example, according to the qrt-pcr and microarray results, the transcript levels for three genes, including fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig>  were highly reduced at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h, whereas fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig> were strongly induced regardless of the time point . when the mrna level of a gene is too low to quantify, or the p-values from the microarray data are very high, it is highly likely that qrt-pcr results will not correlate with microarray data, as was observed for fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> . as compared to the microarray approach, qrt-pcr offers a highly sensitive technique for detecting low amounts of transcripts and provides the transcript level for the gene of interest. for example, the expression intensities for  <dig> genes were relatively low, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  , whereas the amount of mrnas for nad-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases  and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases  were very high and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , particularly in the host containing fgv1-dk <dig> at  <dig> h .

funcat classification for an overview of the transcriptional reprogramming of f. graminearum harboring fgv1-dk21
we subjected a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes to functional catalogue  annotation to gain insight into their functional classifications  <cit> . specifically, we divided differentially expressed genes into four groups . more than half of the differentially expressed genes were not assigned to any functional category. specifically,  <dig> genes  in the group of down-regulated genes at  <dig> h were unclassified. of the functional categories, the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were associated with metabolism . note that  <dig> genes  were down-regulated while  <dig> genes  were up-regulated at  <dig> h, whereas there were more up-regulated genes  than down-regulated genes  at  <dig> h. based on the number of differentially expressed genes, it is likely that genes involved in various metabolic pathways were severely repressed at  <dig> h and then were gradually induced at  <dig> h. along with a gene set for metabolism, genes associated with energy were highly down-regulated  at  <dig> h . in contrast, genes involved in transcriptional and translational machinery were dominantly up-regulated early after fgv1-dk <dig> infection. for example, genes associated with the cell cycle and dna processing , transcription , protein synthesis , protein fate , and those encoding proteins with binding function  were highly up-regulated at  <dig> h. the number of down-regulated genes associated with cellular transport at  <dig> h was almost twice that of up-regulated genes. conversely, the number of up-regulated genes that govern cellular transport was similar to that of the down-regulated genes at  <dig> h.

fgv1-dk <dig> changes the transcript levels of fungal genes involved in ribosome biogenesis
next, we analyzed the enriched gene ontology  terms of the differentially expressed genes. the identified enriched go terms are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the directed acyclic graph  illustrates the go terms that were over-represented . interestingly, go terms related to ribosome biogenesis, such as the ribosome ribonucleoprotein complex assembly , ribosome assembly , ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis , and ribosome biogenesis , were highly over-represented . moreover, go terms for rna processing , ncrna processing , rrna metabolic processes , rrna processing , and maturation of ssu-rrna  were over-represented with high levels of transcripts . similarly, go terms related to the nucleolus, such as the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex , the nuclear lumen , and nucleolus , were over-represented . transcripts associated with the nucleolus were highly accumulated at  <dig> h.

influence of fgv1-dk <dig> on fungal host gene expression related to metabolic pathways and stress responses
it was not surprising that the expressions of genes that involve a range of metabolic pathways were significantly affected by fgv1-dk <dig> infection. consistent with the funcat annotation, go enrichment analysis showed that genes associated with a variety of metabolic pathways were significantly down-regulated, particularly at  <dig> h. for example, over-represented go terms included cellular aromatic compound metabolic processes , organic acid metabolic processes , oxoacid metabolic processes , carboxylic acid metabolic processes , chorismate metabolic processes , aromatic amino acid family biosynthetic processes , quinate metabolic processes , amine metabolic processes , and cellular nitrogen compound biosynthetic processes  . most genes related to over-represented metabolic pathways tended to be down-regulated at  <dig> h. in contrast, the molecular functions for those genes were consistent with the highly up-regulated go terms for transferase activity, transferring nitrogenous group , transaminase activity , and n-acetyltransferase activity  at  <dig> h .

in particular, genes involved in several stress responses, such as to chemical stimulus , organic substances , and camp , were up-regulated, especially at  <dig> h . of the identified go terms, those reflecting interactions with the fungal host  as well as growth or development of symbionts during interactions with the fungal host  at  <dig> h are expected results . all genes associated with host interactions showed highly down-regulated gene expression.

down-regulation of membrane-associated transporter genes
in the cellular component ontology, go terms associated with membranes  were over-represented . interestingly, genes associated with membranes were down-regulated regardless of the time point . furthermore, transporter activity was one of the significantly over-represented go terms with respect to molecular function. of a total of  <dig> go terms for transporter activity,  <dig> were present at  <dig> h, including carbohydrate transmembrane transporter activity , ion transmembrane transporter activity , and sugar:hydrogen symporter activity  . at  <dig> h, three go terms, including primary active transmembrane transporter activity , atpase activity, and coupled to transmembrane movement of substances , were over-represented .

f. graminearum transcription factors participate in transcription regulation of the host containing fgv1-dk21
transcription factors  play a key role in signal transduction pathways by regulating gene expression to control biological processes  <cit> . thus, it is of interest to understand their involvement in fungi–virus interactions at the transcriptional level. whole genome sequences of f. graminearum show that there are at least  <dig> tfs divided into  <dig> families  <cit> . we identified more differentially expressed tfs at the early time point  than at the late time point  . zn2cys <dig>  was the most prevalent tf family, followed by the c2h <dig> zinc finger  and bhlh  families. in addition, centromere protein b, dna-binding region, homeodomain-like, lambda repressor-like, dna-binding, nucleic acid-binding, ob-fold, tf jumonji, and bzip were also identified as tfs showing significant change at the transcript level . zn2cys <dig>  was also the most prominent tf family at the late time point, followed by c2h <dig> zinc finger , bhlh , and bzip  . moreover, the gene expressions of tfs belonging to the myb , tf jumonji, zinc finger , and zinc finger  families were significantly changed. recently, a mutant library of  <dig> putative tfs was established via homologous recombination in f. graminearum, providing a valuable resource to study gene regulation in fungus  <cit> . thus, it might be of interest to compare phenotypes of mutants for the  <dig> differentially expressed tfs. most tf knock-out mutants show distinct phenotypes. for example, five mutants for which members of the c2h <dig> zinc finger family were deleted  and zn2cys <dig>  displayed abnormal phenotypes compared to wild type controls. interestingly, the deletion of fgsg_ <dig> resulted in a hypervirulence phenotype. the expression of all five of these tfs was strongly up-regulated  <dig> h after virus infection. two genes  were highly expressed in both early and late time points. the ascospore was not formed in fgsg_ <dig> mutants, while that for fgsg_ <dig> exhibited increased resistance to oxidative stress.

discussion
fgv1-dk <dig> drastically induces the expression of fungal host genes required for their replication
perhaps the most striking finding of this study is that the host containing fgv1-dk <dig> accumulates transcripts associated with translation machinery, such as ribosome biogenesis and the nucleolus. ribosomes function in the production of proteins, while the nucleolus is the site of ribosomal rna synthesis and ribosome assembly  <cit> . the nucleolus actively participates in a variety of biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell growth, stress sensing, and viral infection  <cit> . moreover, genes involved in rna processing were highly induced. these genes convert precursor rnas such as non-coding rna  and small subunit  ribosomal rnas molecules into mature rna molecules. taken together, these findings suggest that the entire complex for protein synthesis and processing in fungal host cells was highly activated by fgv1-dk <dig> 

viruses rely on host cell machinery and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to achieve replication efficiently during virus infection  <cit> . given that nucleolus localizing genes were up-regulated, it appears that the virus stimulates gene expression associated with nucleolus. as a result, the nucleolus produces numerous ribosomes to maximize viral replication. in addition, the virus might control protein synthetic machinery in host ribosomes to replicate viral proteins. recently, proteomics-based studies confirmed the involvement of the nucleolus in viral infection and replication  <cit> . previous studies have shown that rna viruses can interact with several nucleolar proteins such as nucleolin, b <dig>  and fibrillarin to facilitate virus replication  <cit> . thus, it might be of interest to examine the interactions between nucleolar proteins from f. graminearum and fgv1-dk <dig> viral proteins in future studies. although our data suggest that expression of genes related to ribosomes was strongly affected by virus infection, this might be a common phenomenon in hosts in response to various kinds of virus. thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that ribosomes are indirectly involved in the replication of dsrna viruses. since little is known about dsrna viruses, we refer to many results from single-stranded  rna viruses to support our data. the system for dsrna viruses might differ from that of ssrna viruses.

genes associated with metabolic pathways play a critical role in the fungal defense mechanism against viral infection
metabolism is the core of cellular functions, and comprises numerous reactions that function in the degradation of nutrients and biosynthesis of cellular components including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, dna, and rna. our results, as well as a previous report of c. parasitica, found dramatic differences in gene expression associated with metabolic pathways  <cit> . however, there are inherent differences between that study and the present one. specifically, our microarray data demonstrated down-regulation of genes involved in metabolism. in contrast, the previous study found that the majority of metabolites, including lipids and carbohydrates, were significantly accumulated  <cit> . this difference may be due to different infection times. we found the most dramatic changes in gene expression at the early time point, whereas metabolic probing showed that a variety of metabolites accumulated with increasing infection time  <cit> .

differential expression of genes related to metabolism might be associated with the altered host phenotype. for example, in the group of down-regulated genes at  <dig> h, genes for cell type differentiation were also highly enriched, suggesting that host cell differentiation seems to be induced by viral infection. interestingly, several studies provide evidence that filamentous differentiation in fungi is required for virulence  <cit> . regardless of viral infection stage, genes related to cell rescue, defense, and virulence were highly up-regulated, suggesting that the host defense system was consistently activated. compared to the whole genome, genes with significantly enriched functions were mostly found in the group showing up-regulation at  <dig> h, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation in the host harboring mycovirus is more important at the early time point than the late time point.

of the altered metabolites, our study as well as a previous report  <cit>  found dramatic changes in gene expression levels for polyamine production. polyamines play roles in many biological processes, such as cell growth, development, and responses to various stresses  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the down-regulation of genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis during the early stage  could be correlated with reduced levels of don, which confers hypovirulence to host f. graminearum . a previous study showed that polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors decreased mycelial growth of sclerotinia sclerotiorum <cit> . this result is highly consistent with observed phenotypes in virus-infected f. graminearum showing strong inhibition of mycelia growth . however, we do not know whether the inhibition of mycelial growth in f. graminearum is directly related to polyamine biosynthesis.

changes to the membrane-associated transporting system of the host harboring fgv1-dk21
along with the reduced amounts of many metabolites such as carbohydrates, gene expression for the transfer of such metabolites or ions from one side of the membrane to the other was greatly suppressed in the host harboring fgv1-dk <dig>  this indicates that virus infection affects the transport of many micro- and macro-elements in host cells at the transcript level. moreover, this transport system mediates cell-to-cell communication within the host via plasma membranes. for example, transcripts required for cellular communication were highly accumulated at  <dig> h, suggesting that the virus might first stimulate cell-to-cell communication in fungal host cells, which is necessary to trigger host defense mechanisms against viral pathogens. indeed, a recent study reported that infection of chlorovirus, paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>  affects the transport activity of solutes via plasma membranes in chlorella <cit> . plasma membranes are the first barriers to block pathogen attack and can transmit information and molecules between neighboring cells. viruses utilize plasma membranes to interact with signaling molecules. a previous study suggested that virus infection causes depolarization of the host cell membranes, thus decreasing the transport of solutes by active transporters via plasma membranes  <cit> . the impairment of plasma membranes by viruses suggests that all materials required for virus replication should be recruited within the host cell  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that fgv1-dk <dig> might inhibit the transport of diverse metabolites via plasma membranes to the maximize energy required for virus replication within the nucleolus.

fungal-specific tfs are key players in the gene expression regulation in f. graminearum harboring fgv1-dk21
the expressions of members of the zn2cys <dig> tf family were strongly altered at both the early and late time points. these are known to be fungal-specific, and their functional roles are diverse, including sugar and amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, respiration, vitamin synthesis, cell cycle, chromatin remodeling, nitrogen utilization, peroxisome proliferation, drug resistance, and stress response  <cit> . the zn2cys <dig> family is the largest tf family in f. graminearum, comprising  <dig> tfs. of the nine tfs that were differentially expressed at both the early and late time points, six belong to the zn2cys <dig> family, indicating that expression of zn2cys <dig> is necessary in the host harboring fgv1-dk <dig>  furthermore, the enriched go terms for nucleic acid binding that were up-regulated at  <dig> h provide evidence for transcriptional regulation by tfs such as the zn2cys <dig> tf family . to characterize the functional roles of the zn2cys <dig> tf family associated with fgv1-dk <dig>  it is necessary to examine the phenotypes of knock-out mutants. therefore, the recently generated f. graminearum deletion mutant lines will be very useful resources for characterizing the functions of host tfs associated with hypovirulence.

fgv1-dk <dig> triggers camp-mediated signal transduction in host cells
fungi utilize camp-mediated signal transduction pathways to recognize and respond to diverse environmental stimuli. camp signaling is implicated in the regulation of hyphal growth, mating, and gluconeogenesis in many fungi  <cit> . in addition, camp and the g-protein alpha subunit coordinate their activities to regulate differentiation and virulence in some fungi. we found that transcripts for genes associated with responses to camp were highly accumulated in the late stage of virus infection. this result is consistent with previous data that suggested up-regulation of camp levels in the fungal transcriptome by hypovirus infection  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that fgv1-dk <dig> attenuates the pathogenicity of f. graminearum via camp-mediated signaling and that this process occurs relatively late after virus infection.

CONCLUSIONS
recent years have seen extraordinary developments in genome-wide experimental methods. of these, microarray analyses facilitate an understanding of the dynamic gene expression patterns of target organisms during environmental stimuli such as biotic and abiotic stresses. here, given the benefits of the available whole genome sequences of f. graminearum, we generated a 3′ tiling microarray system covering whole genes. to decipher global transcriptional reprogramming in f. graminearum harboring fgv1-dk <dig> in detail, samples were harvested at two different time points, thus providing lists of differentially expressed genes early and late in the host containing fgv1-dk <dig> as compared to an uninfected strain. numbers of differentially expressed genes at the early and late time points were comparable, but the gene lists differed, suggesting time-dependent transcriptional changes. genes that were up-regulated at the early time point included those involved in protein synthesis, such as ribosome assembly, as well as nucleolus and ribosomal rna-processing genes, suggesting that fgv1-dk <dig> strongly modulates translational machinery in f. graminearum to maximize viral replication. moreover, the accumulation of transcripts associated with transcription, such as tfs, indicated that the transcriptional machinery, which is largely regulated by fungal-specific tfs, might be one of the main targets for virus infection. in contrast, genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly those that produce carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, were highly down-regulated at the early time point . interestingly, such components are closely associated with the host defense mechanism. these results suggest that fgv1-dk <dig> suppresses the production of such defense-related components until the transcriptional and translational machinery in host cells have adjusted to fgv1-dk <dig> replication. in addition, transport systems associated with membranes were severely damaged by hindering the recruitment of materials for viral replication within host cells. when faced with viral infection, f. graminearum tries to establish a defense mechanism by consistently up-regulating genes associated with defense and virulence at the late time point . taken together, our data provide strong genome-wide transcriptional evidence of how fgv1-dk <dig> regulates the transcriptional reprogramming in f. graminearum.
