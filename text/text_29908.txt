BACKGROUND
we recently reported that rearranged l-myc fusion  acts as an epigenetic modifier  <cit> . the gene emerged from a sensitized n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenesis screen carried out to identify factors involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription. the screen was based on the identification of mice with altered expression of a multi-copy gfp transgene that is susceptible to epigenetic gene silencing  <cit> . this is a dominant screen and we call the mutant lines modifiers of murine metastable epiallele dominant   <cit> . we found that three of the lines, mommed <dig>  mommed <dig> and mommed <dig>  carry mutations in rlf and have designated the alleles rlfmommed <dig>  rlfmommed <dig> and rlfmommed <dig>  of these, rlfmommed <dig> and rlfmommed <dig> are null alleles and rlfmommed <dig> is hypomorphic  <cit> . mice heterozygous for the mutant alleles displayed increased silencing of both the reporter transgene and another epigenetically sensitive allele, agouti viable yellow  <cit> . mice heterozygous for rlf mutations are viable, with no overt abnormalities. mice homozygous for the null alleles die around birth. little is known about the function of rlf, although the predicted presence of  <dig> widely-spaced zinc fingers suggests a role in transcription  <cit> . bisulphite sequencing at the reporter transgene revealed increased dna methylation in late gestation rlfmommed28/mommed <dig> embryos, consistent with its reduced expression  <cit> .

to discover whether or not rlf has functions at other loci, we have carried out whole genome bisulphite sequencing at three different stages of development and provide evidence that rlf has a role in the maintenance of dna hypomethylation at thousands of elements across the genome. these regions overlap with those previously found to be differentially methylated across different tissue types, called tissue-specific dmrs   <cit> . tissue-specific dmrs overlap with elements involved in transcriptional regulation, in particular enhancers.

here we show that rlf has a role in maintaining dna hypomethylation at enhancers across the genome. increases in dna methylation that occur in the absence of rlf, are accompanied by reductions in h3k4me <dig> occupancy.

RESULTS
loss of rlf results in an increase in dna methylation at short lowly methylated regions across the genome
to understand how rlf affects dna methylation at a genome-wide level, we carried out genome-wide bisulphite sequencing on the livers of e <dig>  embryos . we chose e <dig>  liver because the original screen was carried out using erythroid cells and the liver is the major erythropoietic tissue at this stage of development. also, since e <dig>  embryonic liver is one of encode’s chosen tissues, associations can be made between sites of differential dna methylation and histone marks. mice homozygous for the null allele appear grossly phenotypically normal at this stage, reducing the risk of possible changes to dna methylation that are the consequence of their demise at later developmental stages. bisulphite sequencing was carried out on e <dig>  livers from two wild-type  and two homozygous  littermates to an average depth of 30-fold per sample. approximately 85% of the cpgs in the mouse genome were covered by > <dig> reads and approximately 75% were covered by > <dig> reads . for each cpg, the percentage of converted and unconverted cs across all reads was calculated . sequencing of unmethylated lambda dna, spiked into each sample, confirmed complete conversion . regions differentially methylated between the wild-type and homozygous samples were identified using the following parameters: the region must contain > <dig> cpgs and each cpg must be covered by > <dig> reads. a call was made if the difference between the %mcg of the wild-type  and homozygous  samples was greater than 15%. use of these parameters might bias the analysis to cg rich regions.

we found  <dig>  differentially methylated regions across the genome and call these rlf-dmrs . hierarchical clustering of the rlf-dmrs showed that the two biological replicates of each genotype clustered together, attesting to the reproducibility of the technology . a representative screen shot is shown . one of the rlf-dmrs was the multicopy reporter transgene, the expression of which had been used to identify the mommed mutants in the original mutagenesis screen. this is consistent with our previous findings following bisulphite pcr of a small segment of this element  <cit> . the rlf-dmr extended across the 5 kb transgene, including the hs- <dig> enhancer region .figure  <dig>

in general, the rlf-dmrs were short , occurred at regions of the genome that are less methylated than the surrounding dna  and overlapped with regions that are conserved in placental mammals . these characteristics are consistent with those reported for tissue-specific differentially methylated regions   <cit> . comparison of the two datasets showed that 59% of the e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs overlapped with a tsdmr . the failure of some to overlap is likely to be a reflection of lower coverage in the data used to identify tsdmrs  <cit> . most of the rlf-dmrs,  were more methylated in the mutants, consistent with our previous findings at the transgene locus   <cit> .

rlf–dmrs overlap with elements involved in transcriptional regulation, including those at exons
of the  <dig>  rlf-dmrs identified in e <dig>  liver, approximately half overlapped with refseq transcripts  and half were intergenic  . a relatively small proportion of the rlf-dmrs,  <dig> of the  <dig> , lay within  <dig>  kb of a transcriptional start site  and we found little overlap,  <dig> of the  <dig> , with the  <dig>  cpg islands annotated in the mouse genome in the ucsc genome browser. together these findings suggest that a minority of rlf-dmrs overlap with promoters, consistent with findings for tsdmrs  <cit>  and t-dmrs  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
rlf-dmrs overlap with regulatory regions.  e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs were investigated for overlap with refseq genes, proximity to tss and cpg islands.  e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs overlapping refseq transcripts, were classified according to overlap with transcript features. the central cpg dinucleotide of each rlf-dmr was used to define the overlap. rlf-dmrs that overlapped multiple features were assigned to a single feature according to following ranking: tss > single exon transcripts > 3′ exon/untranslated region  > internal exon > intron. the expected distribution was defined as the union of each feature category genome-wide, subtracting overlapping features of higher rank .  counts of e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs enriched for the histone marks h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac in e <dig>  liver   heat plots showing dna methylation and h3k4me <dig> levels surrounding e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs.  plot showing position of e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs relative to cpg islands for rlf-dmrs located within  <dig> kb of a cpg island. the data has been plotted around the centre of the cpg island and sorted according to the methylation level of the cpg island.  an example of region of dna at a rlf-dmr that has been shown to have enhancer properties in neural tube and forebrain of e <dig>  embryos  <cit> .  bisulphite pcr validation of the e <dig>  liver rlf-dmr located between smad <dig> and smad <dig> 



of those rlf-dmrs that overlapped with refseq transcripts, a large proportion, ~50%, were at exons  . this is significantly more than would be expected based on the proportion of genic sequence that is exonic . recent analysis of enhancer-specific chip-seq data has revealed that many exons act as enhancers, affecting transcription of either the gene in which they reside or a neighbouring gene  <cit> . our results are consistent with this finding.

using the encode e <dig>  liver dataset, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig>  e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs were enriched for h3k4me <dig> chip-seq reads , confirming overlap with enhancers. only  <dig> of the  <dig>  rlf-dmrs were enriched for h3k4me <dig>  a modification more commonly associated with promoters. many of the rlf-dmrs with h3k4me <dig> peaks also had h3k27ac peaks, consistent with active enhancers . again, this is reminiscent of what has been reported for tsdmrs  <cit> . when a rlf-dmr was associated with an unmethylated cpg island, the methylation change tends to occur at the boundaries, the cpg island shores . it is important to emphasise that most of the e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs,  <dig> of  <dig> , were not enriched for any of these histone marks and might represent “vestigial” enhancers .

some e <dig>  rlf-dmrs were found to overlap with dna elements that have been tested for enhancer activity in vivo . in total  <dig> overlapped, of which  <dig> had been found to be positive for enhancer function. for example, a vista-validated intergenic rlf-dmr that lies between smad <dig> and smad <dig> was shown to drive expression in neural tube at e <dig>  . the differential methylation of this rlf-dmr was validated in e <dig>  liver tissue from rlf+/+ and rlfmommed34/mommed <dig>  using bisulphite pcr sequencing .

loss of rlf results in a decrease in h3k4me <dig> at discrete regions across the genome
to ask whether loss of rlf also affects chromatin marks at rlf-dmrs, we performed chip-seq for h3k4me <dig>  chromatin was extracted from two wild-type and two rlfmommed28/mommed <dig> e <dig>  fetal livers. for each sample, 28– <dig> million reads were sequenced. we saw a good correlation between our wild-type datasets and those in encode . to enable characterisation of h3k4me <dig> occupancy at the gfp transgene, a subset of 1x <dig> reads were selected from each dataset and mapped to a mouse genome containing the sequence of the gfp transgene as a separate chromosome. the gfp transgene showed reduced h3k4me <dig> read coverage in homozygous mutants, consistent with the observed increase in dna methylation and decrease in expression . numerous changes in h3k4me <dig> occupancy at rlf-dmrs were observed . of those rlf-dmrs with h3k4me <dig> enrichment, the majority showed a decrease in h3k4me <dig> in the mutants, consistent with that expected from the dna methylation change .figure  <dig>

whilst h3k4me <dig> marks active and poised enhancers, h3k27ac marks active enhancers and promoters  <cit> . to assess whether loss of rlf specifically affects active enhancers, we divided rlf-dmrs into two groups; those with greater than two-fold enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac and those with only the former . the box–whisker plots show that in both groups h3k4me <dig> occupancy was significantly reduced in homozygous mutants compared to wild-types . this finding suggests that at rlf-dmrs, loss of rlf affected h3k4me <dig> occupancy at both active and poised enhancers.

we were keen to see if h3k4me <dig> occupancy was affected at other sites in the genome. h3k4me <dig> peaks were identified and after combining peaks from each of the four datasets, a total of  <dig>  were obtained . analyses of h3k4me <dig> occupancy at these peaks revealed numerous changes in rlf mutants compared to wild-types. using a fold-change cut-off of 50%,  <dig> sites were found with increased occupancy and  <dig> with reduced occupancy. the majority of altered sites showed modest fold changes. only a small subset of sites that showed h3k4me <dig> changes had a rlf-dmr within  <dig> kb . the majority of the latter were decreased, as expected. this means that many of the sites with decreased h3k4me <dig> occupancy did not have a rlf-dmr within 2 kb. the width of peaks with altered h3k4me <dig> were generally larger than the width of rlf-dmrs, consistent with data from others on the width of h3k4me <dig> peaks at and around enhancers   <cit> . figure 3e shows a representative screen shot of one of the regions in which h3k4me <dig> occupancy was found to be reduced in rlf homozygous mutants.

our results suggest that in at least some settings loss of rlf was sufficient to induce a histone change in the absence of a dna methylation change.

rlf-dmrs exist across a range of tissues and developmental stages
data from the encode e <dig>  liver showed that the majority of the e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs  were not enriched for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac or h3k4me <dig>  raising the possibility that many rlf-dmrs might be active enhancers in another tissue or at a different stage of development. indeed, others have noted differentially methylated regions of the adult genome that are not active enhancers but are likely to have been at an earlier stage in development, termed “vestigial”  <cit> . to test this idea, encode’s h3k4me <dig> reads in e <dig>  brain and heart were interrogated and an additional  <dig> e <dig>  liver rlf-dmrs were found to be enriched for h3k4me <dig> in one or other of these tissues . this suggests that many, if not all, of the rlf-dmrs without active histone marks in e <dig>  liver were active as enhancers in other tissues.figure  <dig>

western blot analysis showed that rlf is expressed in many adult, fetal and embryonic tissues . based on this finding, we repeated the whole-genome bisulphite sequencing at both an earlier stage  and a later stage . we used e <dig>  liver because it has a different cell type make-up from e <dig>  liver and the cell type ratios are known. at e <dig> , the liver is the major haematopoietic organ, with 56% of cells being ly76+  and 23% being krt8+ acta2− epithelial cells . by e <dig> , erythroblasts represent only 7% of the total cells and hepatoblasts become the dominant cell type, making up 82% of the total cell population  <cit> . we collected two wild-type and two homozygous samples in each case and sequenced to  <dig> fold depth. in order to make comparisons between these datasets and our previous datasets , we carried out subsampling to equalise the depth of reads across all three . interrogation of a random selection of  <dig> kb fragments across the genome confirmed that subsampling had little effect on the weighted average of methylation in these regions . the global cpg methylation level, shown as cpg methylation levels averaged across  <dig> kb windows, differed across the three tissue types but in each case the overall level was unaffected by lack of rlf .

a total of  <dig>  rlf-dmrs were identified from the e <dig>  liver dataset . the discrepancy between this figure and the  <dig>  previously identified is due to the subsampling and slightly altered parameters used . additionally,  <dig>  were called from the e <dig>  whole embryo dataset and  <dig>  from the e <dig>  liver dataset , resulting in a total of  <dig>  rlf-dmrs across all three datasets.

after merging overlaps,  <dig>  remained as unique coordinates. many were shared and, as expected, the majority were more methylated in the mutants. from the heat-plot it is evident that the rlf-dmrs showed surprisingly similar patterns of methylation change in the two liver datasets, despite quite different cell type populations .

we then asked how many of these  <dig>  were differentially methylated in one or two but not all of the three datasets.  <dig> were found to have a smaller than 5% methylation difference in at least one tissue, suggesting that they were not rlf-dmrs in that tissue .

because of the large change in cell type between the e <dig>  liver and e <dig>  liver, we were interested to see how many rlf-dmrs were different across these two datasets. we found only  <dig> rlf-dmrs that were called in one but not the other .

in summary, rlf-dmrs were identified in all tissues/stages tested and a subset was unique to each dataset.

gene ontology analysis of the genes closest to the  <dig>  rlf-dmrs failed to identify any specific class of gene except for an enrichment for genes encoding transcription factors . because rlf-dmrs were found at regulatory elements, we searched for enriched consensus dna binding motifs at rlf-dmrs. no motifs were found to be significantly enriched over background .

rlf interacts with chromatin-associated proteins involved in transcription and replication and binds dna in vitro
given that rlf was found to be required for normal dna methylation status at regulatory elements throughout the genome, we were interested to find protein partners. co-immunoprecipitation  experiments were performed. human hek293t cells expressing either a flag-tagged rlf cdna  or an empty vector control  were generated via transient transfection. anti-flag conjugated magnetic beads were used to co-ip tagged rlf from nuclear lysates. eluted proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. three biological replicates were used in each case and the data were analysed using scaffold . interactions were considered significant if they showed at least a 5-fold enrichment in rlf-flag samples compared to ev samples. a complete list of binding partners is shown in figure 5a and the number of peptides detected in each biological sample is shown in additional file 9: table s <dig>  many of the identified proteins have established roles in transcription and chromatin modification, or in replication and dna repair, as indicated . a subset of the binding partners was tested using western blot analysis of independent samples . all that were tested in this way, validated.figure  <dig>

to test whether rlf has the capacity to bind dna, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using two non-overlapping sub-fragments of rlf, rlf431– <dig> and rlf1001– <dig>  that contain two and six zinc fingers, respectively . recombinant gst-fusion rlf protein fragments were purified from e. coli and incubated with fluorescein amidite -labelled oligonucleotide probes, called pentaprobes, which have been used previously to test dna binding  <cit> . a protein fragment containing the c-terminal zinc finger of gata <dig>  which is known to bind dna, was included as a positive control. incubation with either rlf1001– <dig> or gata1cf resulted in a shift in the migration pattern of both probes. no shift was detected with rlf431– <dig> fragment . the results suggest that rlf binds dna directly, but not all zinc fingers in rlf mediate dna interactions.

loss of rlf affects mrna levels of some genes in e <dig>  fetal liver
to address whether the absence of rlf influenced transcription, we conducted rna-seq on polyadenylated rna from e <dig>  fetal liver of wild-type and rlf homozygous mutants. a relatively small number of significant changes were detected, using an adjusted p-value < <dig>  . a similar number of up and down-regulated genes were observed relative to wild-type controls. we asked if these differentially expressed genes were proximal to either a rlf-dmr  or a site with reduced h3k4me <dig> occupancy  or both  in the mutant. these were identified and were found to preferentially partition to the genes with reduced expression in the mutants, consistent with an association with transcription. most of those with a greater than  <dig> -fold change showed reduced expression in the mutants .figure  <dig>

ingenuity pathway analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes  showed an over-representation of genes involved in the following networks: cardiovascular system development and function, organismal development, tissue development ; cancer, cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation ; and lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, nucleic acid metabolism . real-time rt-pcr using rna from an independent rlf mutant mouse line, rlfmommed34/mommed <dig>  was used to validate rna-seq findings for four up-regulated and four down-regulated genes . in several cases, heterozygosity for the rlf mutant allele also resulted in significant changes in gene expression , suggesting that dosage of rlf might be critical in some contexts.

taken together with our earlier findings, this data supports a role for rlf in transcription.

discussion
cytosine methylation has a fundamental role in differentiation and development in mammals but the mechanism is unclear. three recent studies of differential methylation in mice and humans found hundreds of thousands of regions that were differentially methylated across different tissues, called ts-dmrs  <cit> . many of these differentially methylated regions overlapped with transcription factor binding sites and with histone marks associated with active enhancers . here we report that the recently identified epigenetic modifier, rlf, is involved in the process of establishing and/or maintaining low levels of dna methylation at a subset of these cis-regulatory elements. the enhancers involved are not specific to one or a few cell types nor can they be assigned to genes of one of a few functional categories. our studies, carried out in only three different tissues/stages in development have revealed  <dig>  unique locations but studies in additional cell types are likely to reveal many more.

one of the interesting observations made in the studies identifying ts-dmrs was that many lacked the h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac marks associated with active or poised enhancers, even in the tissues in which the locus was hypomethylated, raising the possibility that the regions had been active early in development, had become inactive but remained hypomethylated. the term “vestigial enhancer” was used to describe this class  <cit> . our results show that rlf is also involved in the maintenance of hypomethylation at such sites.

independent studies have shown that most tissue-specific differential methylation occurs at cpg island shores  <cit>  and others have speculated that the methylation of these sites will turn out to be transcription factor dependent  <cit> . our findings support this model, with the absence of rlf resulting in increased dna methylation at cpg island shores.

mice null for rlf weigh noticeably less at late gestation and die shortly after birth  <cit> . here we report widespread effects on dna methylation that are observed as early as mid-gestation . rna-seq on e <dig>  embryonic livers reveals that a number of genes were affected by the absence of rlf, although these effects are relatively subtle. the majority of these genes are down regulated in homozygous rlf mutants. many of these changes are associated with the expected chromatin modifications i.e. increased dna methylation and decreased h3k4me <dig>  taken together this suggests a role for rlf in transcriptional activation. the relatively mild nature of the transcriptional changes observed might indicate that in some settings the loss of rlf alone is not sufficient to alter transcription. further study is required to uncover the precise mechanism through which rlf influences gene expression.

electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that rlf can interact with dna directly and it has been proposed that the binding of transcription factors, such as ctcf and rest, at transcriptional regulatory regions is sufficient for hypomethylation  <cit> . these binding events could act simply by preventing the binding of other factors such as dna methyltransferases or by actively recruiting factors such as tet enzymes. the co-immunoprecipitation studies support the idea that rlf acts in concert with other proteins that have known roles in transcriptional regulation. the histone demethylase, kdm1a, which co-immunoprecipitated with rlf, is normally associated with transcriptional silencing. however, it has also been found in a complex with the androgen receptor and in this context it acts as an activator by demethylating h3k9me <dig> marks at transcriptional enhancers  <cit> . this mechanism would be consistent with the predominantly activating effect of rlf on transcription.

although chip-seq studies are likely to shed light on these possible mechanisms in terms of genome occupancy and co-occupancy, suitable antibodies for rlf are not currently available. in the absence of chip-seq data for rlf, we have used whole genome bisulphite sequencing, chip-seq for h3k4me <dig> and rna-seq as tools to identify regions of the genome where the absence of rlf has an effect, linking it to enhancers and transcriptional activation. we have also found that the global levels of cpg methylation are not changed by lack of rlf, making indirect mechanisms e.g. via changes to dna methyltransferase activity, an unlikely explanation for our findings.

whereas proteins with closely spaced arrays of zinc fingers  are relatively common in the genome and are well known as dna-binding factors, proteins with widely-spaced zinc fingers, like rlf, are less common and are poorly characterised. the significance of the wide spacing is unknown  <cit> . interestingly, several other widely-spaced zinc finger proteins have been identified in association with epigenetic programming. for example, su3- <dig> was identified in the original drosophila screen for modifiers of position effect variegation  <cit> , and wiz, was identified in our screen for modifiers of epigenetic reprogramming in mice  <cit> . only a small number of additional widely-spaced zinc finger proteins have been described in the mouse, including the rlf paralog zfp <dig>  <cit>  and peg <dig>  <cit> , both of which can bind dna, and zfp <dig>  and zmat <dig> , both of which can bind double-stranded rna  <cit> . despite being derived from the same ancestral gene, rlf and zfp <dig> have diverged considerably, including at the putative zinc fingers. further studies will reveal how similar these proteins are in their functions.

CONCLUSIONS
overall our data show that rlf has a prominent role in the modulation of epigenetic state at cis-acting regulatory regions across the genome. future studies of this protein will reveal the mechanisms that underlie this process.
