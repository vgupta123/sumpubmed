BACKGROUND
neuropeptide ff  belongs to a family of rfamide peptides and was originally isolated from bovine brain  <cit> . it has a wide range of functions, including effects on pain mechanisms  <cit> , opioid tolerance  <cit> , cardiovascular regulation  <cit>  and neuroendocrinological function  <cit> .

at the physiological level npff seems to have both a direct analgesic effect and a modulatory effect on the opioid system. some of the effects may be mediated via the npff receptors as two such receptors, npff1r and npff2r, have been identified  <cit> . both npff1r and npff2r are expressed in the central nervous system and npff binds to both of them  <cit> . also the other rfamide peptides bind to the npff receptors with varying affinities  <cit> , and therefore the exact nature of the receptor-ligand interactions between rfamides and their receptors is still unclear.

the interaction between npff and opioid system in pain and analgesia seems to be complex in nature and the molecular mechanisms behind the observed physiological effects are not known. binding studies have shown that npff does not displace opioid receptor ligands from any of the opioid receptor subtypes and opiates do not bind to npff binding sites  <cit> . however, many studies suggest that npff mechanisms are functionally coupled to the opioid system . in the rat spinal cord, the highest npff-like immunoreactivity is found in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn, an area involved in the nociceptive processes and pain mechanisms  <cit> . npff has been designated as a morphine modulatory peptide since it is able to influence the actions of opioid peptides within spinal cord and brain  <cit> . npff displays both anti-opioid and opioid-like effects depending on the route of administration. supraspinal administration of npff attenuates opioid antinociception  <cit>  and precipitates opioid withdrawal syndrome  <cit> . intrathecally administered npff causes long-lasting analgesia, which is reduced by both naloxone and naltrindole  <cit> . npff in the periaqueductal grey produces a selective attenuation of tactile allodynia in neuropathic rats  <cit>  that could be mediated indirectly by naloxone-sensitive opioid mechanisms  <cit> . in pontine parabrachial nucleus npff modulates synaptic transmission through interaction with presynaptic dor, providing evidence for the cellular mechanisms of the analgesic action of npff at the supraspinal level  <cit> .

delta opioid receptor  belongs to the family of g-protein coupled, seven trans-membrane receptors  <cit> . dor couples to the pertussis toxin -sensitive gi/o-type of heterotrimeric g-proteins. the receptor can regulate several effector systems, including adenylyl cyclase activity  <cit> , the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases   <cit> , voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels  <cit>  and phospholipase c  <cit> . in cho-cells the dor-induced activation of mapk-pathway is predominantly mediated by the gβγ-subunit of gi/o  <cit>  whereas adenylate cyclase response is mediated by the gαi/o-subunit  <cit> . the involvement of dor in analgesia has been shown using many pain models  <cit>  and agonists acting at dor have a strong antinociceptive effect  <cit> . the agonist stimulation causes rapid desensitization of the receptor by phosphorylation  <cit> , which in turn produces the uncoupling of the receptor from its g-protein. the phosphorylation can be followed by endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex  <cit>  but the desensitization may occur also without receptor internalization  <cit> . the internalized receptor is either degraded or recycled back to the cell membrane  <cit> .

we constructed a stable chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing c-myc-tagged human dor . the cell line was used as a model system to learn about the mechanisms involved in the interactions between npff and hdor at the cellular and molecular level.

RESULTS
characterization of the cell line
the cellular localization of the expressed c-myc-tagged delta opioid receptors in the stable cho-k <dig> clone was analyzed with immunocytochemistry. the cells were stained with an anti-c-myc antibody, detected with a fluorescent secondary antibody and analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. the untransfected wild type cells did not show any fluorescence when stained similarly as the cho/mychdor cells and the pre-absorption of the antibody solution with the c-myc-peptide before immunocytochemistry removed all signal in the cho/mychdor cells, implying that the antibody bound specifically to the myc-tagged receptor . in the cho/mychdor cells a clear fluorescence signal was seen on the cell surface  and dor agonists induced the internalization of the receptor .

the receptor density and ligand binding characteristics of the expressed receptor were determined with 3h-diprenorphine binding assay. the observed values for kd and bmax were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/mg protein , respectively. the functionality of cells expressing myc-tagged dor was shown with the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated accumulation of camp and phosphorylation of erk <dig>  dpdpe dose-dependently inhibited the forskolin-induced accumulation of camp and similarly increased the phosphorylation of the erk <dig> .

the possible presence of npff1r and npff2r in the cho-k <dig> cells was studied with several methods. first the cells were studied with immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. several antibodies against npff receptors were used. in the figure 2a–d the results obtained with two antibodies are shown. the pre-absorption of the antibody solutions with the antigenic peptide before immunocytochemistry removed all immunoreactivity from cho-k1/hnpff2r cells in the case of each antibody tested, implying that the antibodies recognized specifically the antigen. no immunoreactivity was found in the untransfected cho-k <dig> cells , which further suggested that the antibodies bound specifically to the hnpff2r. next the cells were analyzed with rt-pcr. cdna made of total rna from human medial hypothalamus and human placenta were used as positive controls for npff1r and npff2r, respectively, since a relatively high level of receptor expression has been shown in these tissues  <cit> . npff1r and npff2r specific primers based on human and mouse receptor sequences were used in the analysis. no pcr products were obtained from the cho-k <dig> cdna using conditions where the controls tested positive . the binding of npff receptor specific radioligand 125i-npyf to the cho-k <dig> cells was tested. the cells did not bind the 125i-npyf . cell membranes of a commercial hnpff2r expressing cho-k <dig> cell line  were used as a positive control in the experiment . 125i-npyf bound to these cell membranes with the same affinity as reported by the supplier and as observed previously in our laboratory  <cit> . in addition, the npff-analogue alone did not affect any of the tested parameters, such as camp or mapk , which further supported the absence of npff receptors in cho-k <dig> cells.

effect of npyf on the agonist activated dor trafficking
the cho-k <dig> cells expressing myc-tagged dor were treated with  <dig> nm dpdpe  with or without  <dig> nm npyf for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> min at 37°c. the receptor trafficking was analyzed with fluorescence associated cell sorting, facs. after the drug treatments, the cell surface receptors were detected with an anti-myc-antibody and a fluorescent secondary antibody. at the basal state the amount of the cell surface fluorescence, which should reflect the amount of dors located on the cell membrane, was observed to be variable between runs. to control the variation the cells were cultured for a fixed period of time after the last passage prior to internalization studies and grown into 80– <dig> % confluence. the cells were let to recover at 37°c after they were collected from the culture plates and before they were used for the experiments, to ensure that the receptor number on the cell membrane was balanced. some constitutive receptor trafficking was still observed and therefore the treated cells at each time-point were compared to time-matched untreated control cells in order to distinguish between constitutive and ligand-induced receptor trafficking.

as seen in the facs analysis, npyf  alone did not induce receptor internalization at any time-point tested . however, after  <dig> min treatment with the npff analogue somewhat higher fluorescence was detected on the cell surface as in the time-matched control cells. already after  <dig> min treatment with  <dig> nm dpdpe or with  <dig> nm dpdpe and  <dig> nm npyf the cell surface fluorescence was significantly different from the untreated control cells, indicative of ligand-induced internalization of the receptor. there was no significant difference between the treatments at this time-point although the double treatment with  <dig> nm dpdpe and  <dig> nm npyf showed a slight tendency to decrease the surface fluorescence more. at  <dig> min time-point the treatment with  <dig> nm dpdpe together with  <dig> nm npyf  caused significantly greater internalization of dor than the treatment with  <dig> nm dpdpe alone  . at the  <dig> min time-point the cell surface fluorescence was at a significantly reduced level after both treatments but no significant difference was detected between the treatments npyf).

characterization of tb-delti and its binding on whole cells
to further investigate the effects of npyf on dor function a binding assay based on time-resolved fluorometry was developed. tb-labeled delti was custom-made at perkin elmer wallac. delti was labeled with a tb-chelate to the cys-modified n-terminus of the nascent peptide. to check whether the modification changed the affinity of the peptide, tb-delti was tested in a classical radioligand displacement assay. tb-delti displaced the 3h-diprenorphine from cho/mychdor -cell membranes with similar affinity to the unlabeled delti . tb-delti bound to cho/mychdor cell membranes dose-dependently and the binding was saturable at a nanomolar range . the results with fixed whole cells showed similar binding characteristics as with the cell membranes, although the absolute values were below the ones observed with the cell membrane preparations. it was considered that the whole cell protocol can be used to study the effects of npyf on the binding of tb-delti on cho/mychdor since only relative data between the treatments was desired. npyf alone could not significantly displace tb-delti. next the effect of npyf on the specific binding of tb-delti was studied. the total binding of tb-delti on the cho/mychdor cells was determined in the presence of different concentrations of npyf. the unspecific binding of tb-delti was determined by  <dig> μm delti. npyf modified the specific binding of tb-delti to the cho/mychdor cells. the kd for tb-delti was only modestly affected by npyf whereas  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm npyf significantly decreased the bmax for tb-delti . the higher concentrations of npyf affected the bmax only modestly.

inhibition of the forskolin induced accumulation of the camp
dor inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in numerous tissues and cell lines via coupling to gi/o-protein. we examined the ability of the ligand-activated myc-tagged dor to inhibit the forskolin stimulated camp accumulation in cho-k <dig> cells. as expected, already  <dig> min treatment of the cells with the dor agonist dpdpe  reduced the level of forskolin-stimulated camp significantly . similarly, the treatment with dpdpe together with  <dig> nm npyf at this time-point and at  <dig> min time-point inhibited the accumulation of camp. although there was a slight tendency for npyf to enhance the effect of dpdpe already at  <dig> min and  <dig> min time-points, the difference between the treatments was not significant. it was only after  <dig> min treatment that npyf had a robust effect on the inhibition of camp induced by dpdpe . at  <dig> min time-point the double-treatment with dpdpe + npyf resulted in  <dig> % inhibition of forskolin stimulated camp accumulation in comparison to  <dig> % inhibition when treating the cells with dpdpe alone. npyf alone did not have any significant effect on the amount of camp. both the effect of dpdpe and dpdpe + npyf was completely blocked by the pre-treatment with pertussis toxin . npyf was also able to enhance the inhibitory effect of other dor agonists, e.g. delti, on the camp accumulation , indicating that the modulatory effect of npyf on the inhibition of camp accumulation is not agonist specific.

the effect of npyf dose on the inhibitory action of dpdpe on the camp accumulation was also studied. the camp accumulation was measured at  <dig> min time-point. above  <dig> nm dpdpe the camp inhibition reached saturation and addition of higher concentration of dpdpe did not result in further inhibition of forskolin stimulated camp accumulation . npyf had a significant effect on the dpdpe-induced camp inhibition npyf p <  <dig> ,  × [npyf p <  <dig> , n = 3). more specifically,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm npyf together with dpdpe enhanced the dor agonist induced inhibition of camp accumulation significantly at all tested dpdpe concentrations  whereas the lowest and highest tested concentrations of npyf had hardly an effect on the camp accumulation .

activation of map-kinase signaling pathway
the activation of map-kinase p42mapk  is characterized by the appearance of the phosphorylated form of the erk <dig>  the phosphorylated erk <dig> was detected on the immunoblots after the cells were treated with dpdpe, npyf or both for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes at 37°c. the basal level  of phosphorylated erk <dig> was at the detection limit of the antibody and only a very faint band could be detected . when quantified, this band did not markedly differ from the background. the treatment of the cells with npyf alone did not result in the activation of erk <dig> . neither did any of the treatments significantly affect the total amount of erk <dig>  the total erk <dig> was controlled from the immunoblots with an antibody detecting the unphosphorylated form of the kinase, which was compared to the amount of tubulin in each sample.

dpdpe  activated the mapk pathway as expected . the peak in activation was observed after  <dig> minutes dpdpe-treatment followed by a decrease in the amount of the phosphorylated kinase. the addition of npyf  together with dpdpe  significantly promoted the activation induced by dpdpe. the peak in activation with dpdpe + npyf was detected already after  <dig> min in contrast to  <dig> min peak-activation time for dpdpe alone. at  <dig> min time-point there was no significant difference in the amount of phosphorylated erk <dig> between dpdpe and dpdpe + npyf-treated cells. however, at this time-point the level of phosphorylated erk <dig> in the dpdpe + npyf-treated cells had already started to decline whereas in the dpdpe-treated cells the level of phosphorylated erk <dig> was still increasing when compared to the earlier and later time-points. in both dpdpe-treated cells and dpdpe + npyf-treated cells after  <dig> minutes agonist stimulation the level of activated erk <dig> had almost decreased back to basal values.

discussion
npff's role in physiological pain sensation and opioid analgesia is well characterized. some of the npff's pain-related effects are mediated by the delta opioid receptor system . in this study we examined the role of npff in the modulation of dor-mediated cellular responses. we wanted to establish a simple model system to study the effect of npff analogue, npyf, on the dor function in the absence of npff receptors. we generated a cell line expressing n-terminally c-myc-epitope tagged human dor at close to physiological expression levels . we also verified that the cells do not express functional npff receptors.

the expression level and binding affinity of the selected cho/mychdor clone was within the same range as that reported for the well-studied ng108- <dig> neuroblastoma cell line  <cit>  and for some native neuronal tissues e.g. rat striatum  <cit> . at this expression level the receptor trafficking and cellular signaling of the cells are expected to be normal but extreme over expression of a receptor might disrupt the functional properties of the cells. the cells responded to dor ligands as expected in two different functional assays and the ligands also induced the internalization of dor. in the basal state, some receptors were found in the internal parts of the cells, which is consistent with the previous findings for the delta opioid receptor  <cit> . taken together, the pharmacological studies and confocal microscopic analysis together with functional assays suggested that the n-terminal modification of hdor did not affect the ligand selectivity, functional coupling or trafficking of the expressed receptors.

dor belongs to the large family  <dig> of gpcrs. we hypothesized that instead of, or in addition to operating via indirect mechanisms, npff could have a direct modulatory effect on dor. compounds that modulate the receptor activation have been described for other members of the receptor family . modulators can potentate or block the agonist stimulation of the receptor in many ways, such as by changing the agonist affinity or stability of receptor-g-protein interaction  <cit> .

our facs studies showed that in the presence of npyf the agonist-induced internalization of dor was enhanced. the increase in the receptor internalization by npyf was most obvious after  <dig> min agonist exposure. the dor antagonist naltrindole could completely block, not only the receptor activation by dor agonists alone, but also the enhanced activation resulting from the co-application of npyf with dor agonists. this provides evidence that the observed effects were solely dor-mediated. in vivo many of the analgesic effects of npff are blocked by both the non-specific opioid-antagonist naloxone and the dor-specific antagonists naltrindole  <cit> . the differences between time-points and treatments in the facs analysis were consistent and reproducible as assessed with statistical methods.

to study the effect of npff in dor systems, we introduced a new tool to study the interactions between receptors and their ligands. a tb-labeled dor-ligand was used in a time-resolved fluorescence based binding assay and it proved comparable to the traditional radiolabel-based methods. tb-delti could be applied to both cell membrane and whole cell assays. this new ligand and other related compounds open interesting possibilities to further study the ligand-receptor interactions, by using methods such as time-resolved fret. our results from the time-resolved fluorescence based binding assays indicate that npff can modulate the binding of dor ligands to the receptor. consistent with the earlier reports with spinal cord membranes  <cit> , npyf did not markedly bind to the classical dor-binding site in the cho/mychdor cells. only micromolar concentration of npyf could displace tb-delti in whole cell and membrane binding assays to some extent. the binding experiments showed that npyf affected the kd of tb-delti only slightly, whereas the bmax values were significantly decreased by low to modest concentrations of npyf. it should be noted that the effects of npyf on ligand binding observed in assays using a labeled agonist tb-delti were partly verified by using a labeled antagonist, 3h-diprenorphine, as the ligand. in addition, while most of the experiments were performed with whole cells, a protocol that mimics the cellular environment for the natural receptor binding, the results were also to some extent confirmed with cell membrane preparations. this was to avoid the contribution of possible endogenous effector molecules present in whole cells.

the lack of change in the kd for opioid ligands implies that especially at low concentrations npyf does not work through the classical opioid binding site of dor. the dose-dependence of npff-agonist on the bmax was bell-shaped. this could imply that the npff-analogue affects only some conformations of the receptor. interestingly, also the effect of npff on prolactin release from rat pituitary cells show a bell-shaped dose-response curve  <cit> . however, the receptor involved in the prolactin release mechanism was not characterized. the npff-analogue had an effect on the bmax at lower concentrations  than on the signaling cascades studied. this could be related to the mechanism of the functional modulation of dor by the npff-analogue. one possible mechanism could involve a modulatory binding site for npff on dor. modulatory binding sites have been described for other members of the gpcr family  <cit> . in line with our results, the gpcr modulators exert their effects commonly only in the presence of the receptor ligand  <cit> . in the future, the exact nature of interactions between dor and npff will be further studied.

the modulatory effect of npyf on dor-mediated signaling was studied by measuring the activation of two differently regulated signaling cascades. the signaling studies suggested that npyf alone did not affect dor function but when applied together with a dor agonist it significantly promoted the response of the activated signaling cascade. npyf could enhance the dor agonist induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation, a signaling cascade primarily regulated by the gi/oα-subunit. the signaling via dor was most strongly affected by npyf at low to modest concentrations of dor agonist. the camp inhibition resulting from double treatment with dpdpe + npyf was greater than inhibition obtained by treatment with dpdpe alone at a broad dpdpe concentration range with various concentrations of the npff analogue. also the maximal camp inhibition obtained with the double treatment was greater than that observed after treating the cells with a dor agonist alone.

in addition to the regulation of camp levels, npyf enhanced the dor agonist-induced phosphorylation of erk <dig>  a member of map-kinase family. the activation erk <dig> phosphorylation follows a series of activation steps initiated by the gβγ-subunit. interestingly, in the cells subjected to npyf together with a dor agonist an earlier peak in activation of erk <dig> was observed than in cells treated with a dor agonist alone. the finding that npff affects two differently regulated signaling cascades downstream from g-protein activation gives support for our hypothesis that npff works at the receptor level, prior to the g-protein activation. both the dor agonist-induced activation of receptor-mediated signaling and the enhanced activation caused by the addition of npyf together with dor agonist were completely blocked by ptx, giving evidence that npff delivers its effects via the same g-proteins as the dor agonists binding to the classical binding site.

the enhancement of the dor-mediated signaling could be due to the increased receptor trafficking. the accelerated internalization of the membrane-bound receptors could account for the enhanced signaling observed. the effect of npyf on the internalization of dor was transient and relatively small. there is some evidence that dor ligands can affect the balance between receptors located on the cell membrane and receptors residing in the internal parts of the cells  <cit> . petäjä-repo et al.  <cit>  have shown that dor ligands can work as molecular chaperones, i.e. ligand binding to the receptor induces the transport of receptors to the membrane. it is likely that also the increased recruitment of the receptors from the internal pools to the cell membrane could account for the observed effects. cahill et al.  <cit>  showed that enhanced antinociceptive activity of delti is correlated with the recruitment of spinal opioid receptors from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane and that inflammation, a state that activates dor -mechanisms, produces outward movement of intracellular dors towards the plasma membrane. therefore, the observed rate of internalization may be masked to some extent by the recruitment of the receptors from the internal pools. it should be noted that all the phenomena described above were observed with both the peptidic agonist delti and the cyclic agonist dpdpe. this implies that the effect is not between the agonists and npyf but rather that npyf modifies the receptor and alters its characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that some of the npff's antinociceptive effects and interactions with opioid systems could at least in part be mediated directly via dor. the agonist-induced internalization of dor and the dor mediated signaling are enhanced by npff, the specific binding of ligands to dor is modified by npff. all changes observed in the different assays were in agreement with each other, although they had a bit different time-courses, and they all support the suggested direct interaction between npff and the dor-ligand complex. the different time-course of events could be due to the various regulatory mechanisms involved. for example, the inhibition of the adenylate cyclase activity is directly regulated by the gi/o-protein α-subunit and the phosphorylation of erk <dig> is mainly activated by the gβγ subunit. the observed effects are also physiologically relevant, as published data suggest that opiate-induced analgesia is potentiated by npff  <cit> , and the dor antagonist naltrindole inhibits the npff-induced antinociception  <cit> . although the modulatory effect of npyf was moderate or in some cases quite small, it was consistently observed with all methods used in this study. as mentioned earlier, cho-k <dig> cells do not express detectable levels of npff receptors. therefore, dor alone could be responsible for the modulatory effects of npyf observed in this study. the results were obtained using a heterologous expression system and therefore they cannot be directly extended to in vivo conditions. recent data based on opioid knockout mice show that dor is mainly involved in the inflammatory and mechanical nociception  <cit> . npff expression is also significantly increased in inflammatory pain  <cit> , and npff modulates descending inhibitory input to the wide-dynamic range neurons  <cit> . some of the effects of npff in pathological pain and interactions with morphine may be mediated via dor. this does not exclude e.g. the possible involvement of npff2r in pain mechanisms  <cit> . as two receptors for npff have been characterized, it seems likely that npff can have several functions depending on the site of action and availability of receptors. npff may be a multi-functional neuropeptide capable of affecting several neuronal systems through different receptors and signaling pathways, the effects depending on the other players present at the site action.
