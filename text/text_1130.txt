BACKGROUND
during animal development, the vitamin a-derived morphogen retinoic acid  mediates a number of crucial functions, including, for example, early embryonic patterning and organogenesis, by acting on different cellular processes ranging from proliferation to cell death . in vertebrates, normal development requires a very tightly controlled balance of the total amount of available ra, which is maintained through positive and negative feedback loops associated, respectively, with ra production  and ra degradation  . the biological response to endogenous ra, in turn, is mediated by heterodimers of two nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor  and the retinoid x receptor , with the expression levels of rar in particular being tightly linked to the availability of ra  <cit> . rar/rxr heterodimers directly exert their transcriptional function by binding to ra response elements  in the regulatory regions of ra target genes  <cit> . a typical rare is composed of two direct repeats  corresponding to a conserved nucleotide sequence  separated by a spacer composed of one, two or five nucleotides  . upon ra binding, rar/rxr heterodimers generally function as ligand-activated transcription factors, but can also mediate ra-dependent repression of target genes in a context-specific manner, the exact molecular modalities of which still remain to be established  <cit> .

during vertebrate development, the ra degrading enzymes of the cyp <dig> subfamily play critical roles in the formation of an anterior-posterior  ra gradient as well as in the compensation of ra level fluctuations by oxidizing ra into biologically inactive compounds  <cit> . they are thus characterized by dynamic, yet highly specific, developmental expression patterns in vertebrates  <cit> , with cyp26a <dig>  for example, being expressed in the anterior ectoderm in the early embryo and subsequently becoming localized, amongst other tissues, to the hindbrain, the pharyngeal arches, and the tail bud. similarly, both cyp26b <dig> and cyp26c <dig> are detectable in specific rhombomeres of the hindbrain and in pharyngeal arches as well as in fin and limb buds of the developing embryo  <cit> . concomitantly, the loss of cyp <dig> function has been associated both with a-p patterning defects, most prominently in the developing central nervous system  and the mesoderm, and an increased sensitivity to ra teratogenicity  <cit> . for instance, cyp26a <dig> knockout mice are characterized by a posteriorization of the hindbrain and the vertebral column, and cyp26b <dig> genetic ablation leads to craniofacial and limb malformations  <cit> . interestingly, while the loss of cyp26c <dig> alone does not result in overt anatomical abnormalities  <cit> , the combined removal of cyp26c <dig> with either cyp26a <dig> or cyp26b <dig> induces phenotypes that are more severe than those aforementioned, thereby suggesting that cyp26c <dig> plays an important cooperative role in the cyp26-mediated control of endogenous ra levels during vertebrate development  <cit> .

in line with this cooperative action of cyp <dig> enzymes, the vertebrate ra signaling system in general is characterized by complex feedback mechanisms that are mediated, either indirectly or directly, by rar/rxr-dependent signaling. as an example of an indirect regulation, it has been shown that, in the vertebrate trunk, ra, generated by raldh activity, represses and confines fgf <dig> expression to rostral and caudal domains   <cit> . this action is mediated by rar/rxr heterodimers binding to a repressive dr <dig> rare located upstream of the fgf <dig> gene  <cit>  that, in turn, activates cyp <dig> expression both anteriorly and posteriorly to limit the extent of ra activity  <cit> . in addition, the expression of cyp26a <dig> and cyp26b <dig> have been shown to be dependent on ra activity, thereby generating a cyp26-controlled negative feedback loop in ra sensitive tissues to reduce the overall amount of available ra  <cit> . for cyp26a <dig>  this regulation is directly mediated by rar/rxr heterodimers binding to dr <dig> rares in the promoter region, while for cyp26b <dig> this control seems to be indirect  <cit> . note further that the vertebrate cyp26c <dig> gene is likely to contribute differently than its paralogs to this negative feedback system, as cyp26c <dig> expression is actually downregulated following ra stimulation  <cit> .

the intricate molecular mechanisms controlling the catabolism of endogenous ra during vertebrate development likely arose at the base of this lineage following the whole genome duplication  events that took place during early vertebrate diversification  <cit> . therefore, the evolutionary elaboration of the ra signaling system in general seems to be tightly linked to the duplication of ra metabolism genes. the so-called ddc model  predicts three possible outcomes following duplication of a gene: non-functionalization , neo-functionalization  or sub-functionalization   <cit> . while the model predicts that the most likely outcome following duplication of a gene is the loss of one of the duplicates , very clear examples for the neo-functionalization and the sub-functionalization of duplicated genes remain scarce  <cit> .

in order to develop a credible scenario for the evolutionary diversification of the vertebrate ra system and investigate the implications of the ddc model in the duplication of ra metabolism genes, we decided to study the function and regulation of ra degradation during embryonic development of the cephalochordate amphioxus . due to its phylogenetic position at the base of chordates, amphioxus is a very useful model to characterize chordate- and vertebrate-specific innovations, both on a morphological and a genomic level. for instance, at the morphological level, amphioxus and vertebrates share a dorsal cns, a postanal tail as well as pharyngeal gill slits  <cit> , while, conversely, amphioxus lacks some vertebrate-specific characters, such as definitive neural crest and placodes as well as a cartilaginous or bony skeleton  <cit> . furthermore, amphioxus is a basal chordate that did not undergo wgd  <cit>  and that possesses a vertebrate-like ra signaling pathway  <cit> . thus, while ra signaling in vertebrates is generally controlled by three rars  and three rxrs  that form a multitude of different heterodimers, the amphioxus genome contains only one rar and one rxr gene  <cit> . nevertheless, administration of exogenous ra during amphioxus gastrulation leads, as observed in vertebrates, to the posteriorization of the amphioxus cns and endoderm, hence preventing, for example, the formation of mouth and gill slits . these regionalization defects are further associated with a deregulation of rar and hox gene expression, which have been shown to be direct targets of ra signaling in amphioxus, as they are in vertebrates  <cit> .

in amphioxus, three cyp <dig> genes  have been reported, which are clustered together in the genome and have possibly emerged from a lineage-specific duplication  <cit> . this cyp <dig> locus offers a rare, if not unique, opportunity to investigate the adaptive changes following lineage-specific duplication that led to the retention of three cyp <dig> genes in the genome. the results from our analyses thus show that the three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes arose by lineage-specific tandem duplication of a single, ancestral cyp <dig> gene. they further provide evidence that these three genes assume two main functions during amphioxus development, as they do in vertebrates, i.e. patterning of the embryo and protection against ra level fluctuations. these two roles have been sub-functionalized in amphioxus with cyp26- <dig> mediating ra-dependent developmental patterning and cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> assuming the protection of the embryo from ra teratogenesis. moreover, the presence of functional rares in the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster indicates that ra degradation is regulated in cephalochordates like in vertebrates, i.e. directly by rar/rxr heterodimers, hence establishing a negative ra feedback system. comparative genomic analyses of cyp <dig> regulatory regions from different bilaterian animals further suggest that this cyp26-dependent negative ra feedback system is not unique to chordates, but probably arose earlier in animal evolution and was already present in the last common ancestor of all deuterostomes, but not in that of all bilaterians. the adaptive advantages of an elaborate cyp26-driven ra degradation system are discussed. in sum, the evolutionary history of amphioxus cyp <dig> genes provides an excellent example for the sub-functionalization of two distinct developmental functions and a paradigm for understanding the selective mechanisms acting on duplicated genes and leading to their retention in the genome.

RESULTS
cyp <dig> genes were duplicated independently several times in bilaterian evolution
previous analyses have reported three cyp <dig> genes in the florida amphioxus, branchiostoma floridae, and have suggested that they likely originated by lineage-specific duplication from a single ancestral cyp <dig> gene  <cit> . here, we have identified and cloned three cyp <dig> genes from the european amphioxus, branchiostoma lanceolatum. to further assess the phylogenetic relationships of the amphioxus cyp <dig> genes relative to each other and to other members of the cyp <dig> subfamily, thereby distinguishing between orthologous and paralogous cyp <dig> genes, we first carried out phylogenetic analyses using as outgroup the cyp <dig> genes, which constitute the cyp subfamily that is most closely related to the cyp <dig> genes  <cit> . for this phylogenetic tree reconstruction, we used all cyp <dig> sequences from  <dig> vertebrates and  <dig> invertebrates, including three cephalochordate species . of note, while we successfully identified genes encoding cyp <dig> in the genomes of priapulids, brachiopods, mollusks, annelids, sea urchins, hemichordates, cephalochordates, ascidian tunicates, and vertebrates, we were unable to do so in those of nematodes and arthropods .

within vertebrates, we found three cyp <dig> paralogs in both cyclostomes  and gnathostomes . multiple cyp <dig> paralogs were also identified in most invertebrates species studied , with the notable exceptions of the cephalopod octopus bimaculoides and the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus, each of which possesses only a single cyp <dig> gene .

the results of the phylogenetic analysis , obtained with both the bayesian inference  and the maximum likelihood  methods, suggested an early phylogenetic separation of the vertebrate cyp26a <dig> sequences from the vertebrate cyp26b1/c <dig> sequences. vertebrate cyp26a <dig> and cyp26b1/c <dig> thus formed two independent clades within the cyp <dig> subfamily, both of which being strongly supported:  <dig> / <dig>  for cyp26a <dig> and 1/ <dig> for cyp26b1/c <dig>  within these two vertebrate cyp <dig> clades, the cyclostome sequences consistently branched at the base: lethenteron japonicum cyp26a <dig> at the base of the vertebrate cyp26a <dig>  and cyp26b1/c1a and cyp26b1/c1b from l. japonicum and petromyzon marinus at the base of the vertebrate cyp26b1/c <dig> . within the vertebrate cyp26b1/c <dig> clade, the association of the gnathostome cyp26b <dig> sequences  was less robustly supported than that of the gnathostome cyp26c <dig> sequences , which might be related to the presence of chondrichthyan-specific cyp26b <dig> duplicates  disrupting the base of the cyp26b <dig> branch. of note, while our analysis revealed the general presence of cyp26a <dig>  cyp26b <dig>  and cyp26c <dig> paralogs in chondrichthyans, we were unable to identify a cyp26a <dig> gene in c. milii and a cyp26c <dig> gene in l. erinacea. altogether, these data suggest that the diversification of vertebrate cyp <dig> genes was a highly complex process, involving wgd, lineage-specific duplications as well as secondary gene losses.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of the cyp <dig> subfamily. diagrammatic summary of bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  analyses of the phylogenetic relationships within the cyp <dig> subfamily, with cyp <dig> used as outgroup. the detailed tree is shown in additional file  <dig> and sequence information is given in additional file  <dig>  branch lengths are representative of the amino acid substitution rate and branch support is indicated at each major node as posterior probabilities  for the bi tree and as bootstrap percentages for the ml tree. furthermore, the total number of sequences  and species  is provided for the cyp <dig> subfamily




outside vertebrates, the cyp <dig> sequences from ecdysozoans, ambulacrarians, and cephalochordates always grouped together with very strong support values: the ecdysozoan p. caudatus , the ambulacrarians p. flava and s. kowalevskii , and the cephalochordates b. lanceolatum, b. floridae and b. belcheri . collectively, these results suggest that, within each of these invertebrate groups, the cyp <dig> gene complement originated independently by linage-specific duplication. in contrast, the two sequences from the tunicate c. intestinalis did neither associate with each other, nor reliably with one of the major cyp <dig> clades in the tree. it is therefore impossible to comment on the nature and origin of the cyp <dig> duplication in this animal. similarly, the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of lophotrochozoan cyp <dig> genes is complicated by the lack of phylogenetic resolution between the sequences from the five analyzed lophotrochozoan species, which formed an unresolved polytomy in our analysis. nonetheless, there is evidence for lineage-specific duplications of cyp <dig> genes in the brachiopod l. anatina, which possesses four cyp <dig> paralogs that established two distinct clades in the tree, one very strongly  and one very weakly  supported. furthermore, two of the three cyp <dig> sequences from the oyster c. gigas are grouped within in a single clade, but the support for this association is very weak . future studies will thus have to address the processes underlying the evolution of lophotrochozoan cyp <dig> genes.

to gain further insights into the diversification of cyp <dig> genes in different animal lineages, we next conducted a phylogenetic dating analysis . this survey indicated that the cyp <dig> genes of the ecdysozan p. caudatus were likely duplicated independently at the end of the ordovician . similarly, within the ambulacrarians, we found evidence for linage-specific duplications in hemichordates, which likely occurred during two different periods: the early carboniferous for s. kowalevskii  and the middle triassic for p. flava . finally, in chordate lineages, cyp <dig> genes have also likely been duplicated independently in cephalochordates, tunicates, and vertebrates, with the three cephalochordate genes resulting from an initial duplication in the early carboniferous , followed by a subsequent duplication during the middle permian . in contrast, while it is difficult to conclude on the timing of the duplication giving rise to the two cyp <dig> genes in the ascidian c. intestinalis, the evolution of the vertebrate cyp <dig> complement is complex and implies a series of duplications, including an ancient split into cyp26a <dig> and cyp26b1/c <dig> and the subsequent diversification of cyp26a <dig>  cyp26b <dig>  and cyp26c <dig> during the cambrian period . it should be added that, consistent with the results of the phylogenetic tree, the dating analysis did not yield reliable information on the timing of the duplications of lophotrochozoan cyp <dig> genes.

cyp26- <dig> expression is suggestive of a function in developmental patterning of the b. lanceolatum embryo
in vertebrates, cyp26a <dig>  cyp26b <dig>  and cyp26c <dig> have very distinct expression patterns with several key domains being conserved between different species  <cit> . thus, we next assessed the temporal and spatial distribution of the three cephalochordate-specific duplicates in the amphioxus b. lanceolatum by in situ hybridization . the ish results revealed that the expression profiles of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> are generally quite similar . for both genes, no signal was detectable by ish from fertilization through mid gastrulation. expression of both cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> is first identifiable at late gastrula stages as a weak signal in the lateral anterior mesoderm . as development proceeds, this domain becomes associated with the most anterior somites at mid neurula stage . at this stage, cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> are also discreetly and transiently expressed in the anterior central nervous system , at the level of the first somite . expression of both genes remains very weak and chiefly associated with mesodermal tissues during subsequent developmental stages : while the cyp26- <dig> signal is most evident in central and posterior regions of the larva , cyp26- <dig> is mainly detectable in central and more anterior larval territories .fig.  <dig> developmental expression patterns of amphioxus cyp <dig> genes. whole mount in situ hybridization experiments were carried out for cyp26- <dig> , cyp26- <dig> , and cyp26- <dig> . amphioxus  embryos and larvae are shown as lateral views with anterior to the left and the dorsal side up, excepting for , which are dorsal views  with anterior to the left, and for  and , which are cross-sections viewed from the front. cross-sections in  are through the embryo shown in  at the levels indicated by the dashed lines and cross-sections in  are through the embryo shown in  at the levels indicated by the dashed lines. white asterisks in  highlight inconspicuous early expression domains of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig>  arrowheads in  indicate central nervous system expression and in  ectodermal signal. developmental stages shown are: early gastrula , late gastrula , mid neurula , very early larva , early  larva . scale bars are 100 μm for the whole mounts and 50 μm for the cross-sections




in contrast to cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig> has a much more complex developmental expression profile during b. lanceolatum embryonic and early larval development. expression of cyp26- <dig> is first detectable by ish at the mid gastrula stage with the signal being localized globally around the blastopore . the blastopore-associated signal subsequently weakens and, at the late gastrula stage, an additional expression domain appears in a region corresponding to presumptive lateral mesoderm and anterior neuroectoderm . by the mid neurula stage, the mesodermal signal has been expanded into the two anterior-most somite pairs . at this stage, cyp26- <dig> is further still detectable in the anterior neuroectodem . additionally, the gene is now expressed in the ectoderm, most conspicuously in the anterior and posterior tips of the embryo , as well as in the anterior- and posterior-most endoderm . at the mid neurula stage, the blastopore-associated signal becomes perceivable in the newly formed tail bud . in very early larvae, just before the opening of the larval mouth, expression of cyp26- <dig> is detectable anteriorly in all germ layers, i.e. the ectoderm, the mesoderm, the endoderm as well as in the cns, with the signal being least noticeable in the endoderm . furthermore, in both ectoderm and cns, individual cells are labeled along the a-p body axis  and, at the posterior end of the embryo, the tail ectoderm strongly expresses cyp26- <dig> . in the amphioxus larva, the overall domains of cyp26- <dig> expression are maintained, with conspicuous labeling anteriorly and posteriorly and a weaker signal in the center . in sum, while cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> expression is very discreet and chiefly limited to the mesoderm, that of cyp26- <dig> is detectable in all germ layers and dynamically changes in space and time throughout development.

cyp <dig> acts as a fine regulator of ra levels in the patterning of the b. lanceolatum larval tail fin
disruption of cyp <dig> activity causes very severe defects during vertebrate development  <cit> . to determine the role of cyp <dig> enzymes in the amphioxus embryo, we subsequently disrupted endogenous ra degradation during amphioxus development by treatments with the cyp26-specific inhibitor r <dig>  <cit> . for comparisons, the r <dig> treatments were carried out in parallel to treatments with ra or with two different rar antagonists . the capacity of r <dig> to inhibit endogenous ra degradation was verified by double treatments of r <dig> and bms <dig>  the results obtained from these different pharmacological treatments of b. lanceolatum embryos are in large agreement between each other and with previous studies that characterized the roles of ra signaling in amphioxus endoderm specification and pharyngeal patterning . thus, while the downregulation of ra signaling activity by rar antagonists  resulted in an enlarged pharynx and an expansion of pharyngeal structures , the upregulation of endogenous ra signaling by 1 μm ra led to a shortening of the pharynx and the malformation of pharyngeal structures  . consistently, the local upregulation of ra signaling by  <dig>  μm r <dig> yielded similar results , and co-treatments of  <dig>  μm r <dig> and 1 μm bms <dig> led to an attenuation of the severe phenotype induced by  <dig>  μm r <dig> alone with at least a partial recovery of pharynx formation and patterning .fig.  <dig> effects of retinoic acid  signaling alterations on the development of amphioxus.  early amphioxus  larvae at 60 h of development with anterior to the left and the dorsal side up are shown as maximal projections of confocal microscopy scans displaying auto-fluorescence  and hoechst nuclear staining . magnifications of the tail region are boxed, with anterior to the left and the dorsal side up. scale bars are 100 μm for the larvae and 50 μm for the magnified tail fins.  tail fin length measurements following pharmacological treatments. the length of the tail fin of b. lanceolatum larvae at 60 h of development was measured, as indicated in the schematics. the graph shows the tail fin lengths ± standard deviation, with n =  <dig>  for the different treatment conditions indicated. tail fin lengths that are significantly different from the dmso control are indicated as “*”, for a cutoff value of p =  <dig> , and as “**”, for a cutoff value of p =  <dig> .  rootletin expression in the tail fin of early b. lanceolatum larvae at 60 h of development, with anterior to the left and the dorsal side up. arrowheads in  indicate expression in lateral ectodermal cells. pharmacological treatments are as indicated. scale bars are 100 μm




importantly, these pharmacology-based experiments revealed a previously undescribed role of ra signaling in developmental patterning of the amphioxus larval tail fin, a finding that is consistent with localized expression of cyp26- <dig> in the amphioxus tail fin ectoderm. at  <dig> h of development, amphioxus larvae are characterized by an ectodermal tail fin that is pointy in shape and on average  <dig>  μm long . when amphioxus embryos were treated with ra at the gastrula stage, the resulting tail fins of 60-h larvae are round and significantly shorter. these effects were observable with exogenous treatments of both  <dig>  μm and 1 μm ra . similar results were obtained with r <dig> treatments at  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm . conversely, rar antagonist treatments, with either bms <dig> or bms <dig>  had the inverse effect: the tail fin becomes pointier in shape and is slightly elongated . co-treatment of  <dig>  μm r <dig> with 1 μm bms <dig> led to a partial rescue of the tail fin phenotype with an almost normal shape and a slight reduction of the overall length .

it has previously been shown that the amphioxus larval tail fin is composed of columnar epidermal cells that contain a large ciliary rootlet  <cit>  and that ra signaling promotes tail regression in late, pre-metamorphic b. floridae larvae by downregulating the gene encoding the main component of the ciliary rootlet: the protein rootletin  <cit> . however, the regulation of rootletin expression by ra signaling in the tail fin of early b. floridae larvae has not yet been reported. given the effects on early tail fin formation we observed in b. lanceolatum in response to the alteration of endogenous ra signaling levels, we decided to investigate the patterns of rootletin expression in 60-h b. lanceolatum larvae following the pharmacological treatment regimes detailed above. as previously described for late b. floridae larvae  <cit> , rootletin is expressed in the basal compartment of the columnar tail fin cells in 60-h b. lanceolatum larvae . at this developmental stage, the gene is further detectable in a small number of lateral ectodermal cells .

while treatment with  <dig>  μm ra resulted in a marked reduction of rootletin expression concomitant with an apical compaction of the columnar tail fin cells , 1 μm ra very strongly restricted the rootletin expression domain . the effect on tail fin development of either  <dig>  μm or  <dig>  μm of the cyp <dig> inhibitor r <dig> was similar to that of exogenous ra and the r115866-treated larvae were thus generally characterized by a significant reduction of rootletin expression . the rar antagonists bms <dig> and bms <dig> led to an apical expansion of rootletin expression as well as to an increase of the overall length of the tail fin . furthermore, the rar antagonist treatments induced rootletin expression in additional lateral ectodermal cells not directly associated with the tail fin . intriguingly, while co-treatments of  <dig>  μm r <dig> and 1 μm bms <dig> restored a shortened tail fin with almost normal shape, expression of rootletin remained expanded into the apical territory of the tail fin and detectable in lateral ectodermal cells . altogether, these observations suggest that the formation of the ectodermal tail fin in b. lanceolatum is dependent of ra signaling, with cyp26-dependent degradation playing an important role in fine tuning of endogenous ra signaling levels to ensure proper tail fin outgrowth.

cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> are highly responsive to ra and specifically upregulated to avoid teratogenic effects of ra
in vertebrates, cyp <dig> enzymes are known to function locally to reduce ra levels hence protecting target tissues from ra teratogenesis. in this context, the regulation of cyp <dig> activity is mediated, at least in part, by ra signaling, which very dynamically up- or down-regulates cyp <dig> expression in a tissue-dependent context  <cit> . to obtain insights into the regulation of cyp <dig> genes by ra signaling in b. lanceolatum, we performed quantitative real time pcr  analyses on amphioxus embryos at two developmental stages  that have been treated, at the early gastrula stage, with either 1 μm ra or 1 μm of the rar antagonist bms <dig>  the qpcr experiments assessed the changes in relative expression of the three b. lanceolatum cyp <dig> genes normalized by rar expression in control embryos .fig.  <dig> quantitative changes of amphioxus cyp <dig> expression in response to retinoic acid  signaling alterations. expression of cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> in amphioxus  was assessed by quantitative real time pcr  at two developmental stages . rar expression was also established and used as a normalized positive control.  relative normalized expression  and fold change of expression levels  at the mid neurula stage, using a log <dig> scale.  relative normalized expression  and fold change of expression levels  at the early larval stage, using a log <dig> scale




through these analyses, we found that the expression levels of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> in control embryos were very low when compared to cyp26- <dig>  . ra treatments very significantly increased the expression of both cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> at the mid neurula stage , while cyp26- <dig> levels increased merely by about  <dig>  fold . in contrast, when embryos were treated with the rar antagonist bms <dig>  cyp26- <dig> levels decreased by an average of  <dig>  fold in mid neurulae, while the overall transcription of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> remained relatively unchanged when compared to controls  . in early larvae, ra treatment also significantly increased the expression levels of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> , while that of cyp26- <dig> increased only by about  <dig>  fold . the rar antagonist bms <dig> had the opposite effect and strongly decreased cyp26- <dig> levels by about  <dig>  fold and cyp26- <dig> levels by an average of  <dig>  fold . in contrast, cyp26- <dig> expression dropped by only about  <dig>  fold . these results indicate that, although cyp26- <dig> is the amphioxus cyp <dig> gene most strongly and broadly expressed during embryogenesis, cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> are much more reactive to alterations of endogenous ra signaling levels.

following this quantification, we next assessed, by ish, the developmental expression profiles of amphioxus cyp <dig> genes upon ra signaling-altering pharmacological treatments. using the same developmental stages as for the qpcr analyses , we found that the upregulation of cyp26- <dig> expression upon ra treatment was not uniform . at the mid neurula stage, cyp26- <dig> was most strongly induced in the anterior half of the embryo in all tissue layers , all along the cns as well as in the posterior tip of the embryo in all tissue layers excepting the mesoderm . in early larvae, the gene was upregulated in all tissue layers of the anterior half of the animal, but largely undetectable posteriorly, except in a few cells in the ectoderm . as expected from the qpcr experiments, expression of cyp26- <dig> in embryos and larvae treated with the rar antagonist bms <dig> was very inconspicuous, but, after an extended coloration step, was nonetheless detectable in mesodermal tissues .fig.  <dig> spatial changes of amphioxus cyp <dig> expression in response to retinoic acid  signaling alterations. whole mount in situ hybridization experiments were carried out for cyp26- <dig> , cyp26- <dig> , and cyp26- <dig>  on amphioxus  embryos treated at the late blastula stage with either dmso , all-trans ra  or rar antagonist bms <dig> . the bms009-treated embryo in  and larva in  were subjected to an extended coloration period. mid neurula embryos at 20 h of development  and early larvae at 48 h of development  are shown as lateral views with anterior to the left and the dorsal side up. scale bars are 100 μm




treatment effects were similar, but not identical, for cyp26- <dig>  at the mid neurula stage, ra strongly induced cyp26- <dig> anteriorly and posteriorly in all tissue layers as well as all along the cns and ectoderm . however, following ra treatment, cyp26- <dig> expression was more conspicuous anteriorly and posteriorly in the embryo, when compared to that of cyp26- <dig>  in contrast, in early larvae the effects of ra treatments were less pronounced for cyp26- <dig> than for cyp26- <dig>  chiefly, cyp26- <dig> expression expanded slightly in the mesoderm and ectoderm in the anterior half of the animal . of note, the reduction of cyp26- <dig> expression in the anterior endoderm of ra-treated larvae was due to the absence of pharyngeal structures normally expressing the gene  <cit> . treatments with the rar antagonist bms <dig> generally weakened the cyp26- <dig> signal, most noticeably in the cns, the mesoderm, and both the anterior and posterior ectoderm .

finally, the expression of cyp26- <dig> was also very strongly expanded by ra at mid neurula and early larva stages, even more strongly than that of cyp26- <dig> with a general expansion of the staining observed throughout the embryo at both stages . following ra treatment, expression of the gene was induced anteriorly and posteriorly in all tissue layers, most conspicuously in the center of the embryo in the cns, ectoderm, and mesoderm . by the early larval stage, cyp26- <dig> remained generally upregulated throughout the animal , which contrasts with a more restricted distribution of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> transcripts at this stage of development in response to ra treatments . in embryos and larvae treated with the rar antagonist bms <dig>  the cyp26- <dig> signal was very weak and chiefly limited to mesodermal tissues . altogether, these results show that treatments with ra and rar antagonist induce similar, but not identical, tissue-specific responses of amphioxus cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig>  thereby supporting the notion that each one of the three cyp <dig> genes is required for a distinctive set of developmental functions.

ra regulates cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> directly and via evolutionary conserved functional rares present in the cyp <dig> cluster
to assess, whether the observed effects of ra and rar antagonist on amphioxus cyp <dig> expression were mediated directly by rar/rxr heterodimers, we first carried out pharmacological treatments in the presence of puromycin, a compound that efficiently blocks de novo protein synthesis in developing amphioxus  <cit> . amphioxus mid neurulae were hence treated with puromycin for 5 min prior to adding ra or the rar antagonist bms <dig>  the embryos were then sampled  <dig> h later and, following rna extraction, the expression levels of cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> were determined by qpcr . the results showed that, in the presence of puromycin, ra treatments significantly upregulated expression of both cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> , while that of cyp26- <dig> increased more modestly, by about  <dig>  fold . the rar antagonist bms <dig> had the inverse effect, reducing cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> levels by about  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold, respectively. in contrast, cyp26- <dig> expression stayed relatively stable, decreasing only by about  <dig>  fold . altogether, these results are consistent with the effects of ra pharmacology on the expression of cyp <dig> genes described above. furthermore, they indicate that the responses to ra and rar antagonist treatments of all three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes do not require de novo protein synthesis, thereby implying that they must be mediated directly by rar/rxr protein heterodimers present in the target tissues.fig.  <dig> dynamics of amphioxus cyp <dig> gene expression following protein synthesis inhibition and retinoid treatments. expression of cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> was assessed in amphioxus  by quantitative real time pcr  at the mid neurula stage  following protein synthesis inhibition by puromycin treatment  at 19 h of development and subsequent treatment with dmso , all-trans ra  or rar antagonist bms <dig>  for  <dig> h. relative normalized expression  and fold change of expression levels  relative to the controls are shown




in order to obtain deeper insights into the mechanisms of the direct regulation of cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> by ra signaling we then investigated the genomic environment of cyp <dig> genes in the three amphioxus species with available genomes: b. floridae  <cit> , b. belcheri  <cit> , and b. lanceolatum  <cit> . our analyses allowed us to reconstruct the entire genomic clusters for the three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes, previously described only for b. floridae  <cit>  . although variable in size , the order of the three cyp <dig> genes within the continuous clusters is conserved between the three amphioxus species, lending further support to the notion that these genes originated by tandem duplications from a single ancestral cyp <dig> gene at the base of the cephalochordates. making use of the complete sequences of the three amphioxus cyp <dig> clusters, we further searched systematically for conserved rares in the vicinity of the cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> genes. this in silico survey included a genomic region encompassing  <dig> kbp upstream of the cyp26- <dig> start codon and  <dig> kbp downstream of cyp26- <dig> stop codon . in total, we identified  <dig> candidate rares in b. floridae,  <dig> in b. belcheri, and  <dig> in b. lanceolatum. of these,  <dig> rares were conserved between all three amphioxus species, both in terms of dr motif sequences and their relative position within the cyp <dig> cluster .fig.  <dig> organization and distribution of conserved retinoic acid response elements  in the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster.  schematic representation of the experimentally verified amphioxus  cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> gene sequences, including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions  and the exons of the coding region, as well as of the corresponding scaffolds of the b. lanceolatum genome that cover the complete cyp <dig> cluster and thus also include intronic and intergenic regions. the names of the b. lanceolatum genome scaffolds are indicated, as is their orientation relative to the cyp <dig> cluster .  distribution of conserved amphioxus rares in the b. lanceolatum cyp <dig> cluster. the orientation of each rare is indicated relative to the cyp <dig> cluster . rares recognized and bound by the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer in vitro are indicated in black, rares that do not associate with the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer in vitro are shown in grey. the rare sequences are given in additional file  <dig> and the in vitro assays are shown in fig. 8





these conserved amphioxus cyp <dig> rares, i.e.  <dig> dr <dig>   <dig> dr <dig>  and  <dig> dr <dig> elements, were subsequently used in emsa analyses to investigate their capacity, in vitro, to interact with the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer. note that, even though dr <dig> elements are not considered as common rares, they were included in this survey. the results showed that the dr <dig> element and  <dig> of the  <dig> dr <dig> elements can be recognized and bound by the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer , indicating that most of these rares might be functional in vivo. furthermore, the consensus signature of the in vitro validated amphioxus dr <dig> elements  is very similar to the classical vertebrate dr <dig> signature  , suggesting that, as in vertebrates  <cit> , amphioxus cyp <dig> genes are regulated directly by ra signaling via rares located in close vicinity of the open reading frames .fig.  <dig> in vitro validation of putative retinoic acid response elements  in the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster. using in vitro synthesized branchiostoma lanceolatum rar and rxr proteins, the binding of the cognate rar/rxr heterodimer to putative rares identified in the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster was assessed. the mouse cyp26a <dig> dr <dig> sequence   <cit>   was used as 32p-radiolabeled double-stranded probe. the rxr and rar lanes respectively contained only in vitro synthesized rxr or rar proteins, together with the radiolabeled probe. the h <dig>  lane contained radiolabeled probe as well as rar and rxr proteins. the ns  lane contained a non-specific and unlabeled double-stranded dr element in 100-fold molar excess relative to the radiolabeled probe as well as rar and rxr protein. all other lanes contained one of the  <dig> putative amphioxus dr elements  at 10-fold  or 100-fold  molar excess, along with rar and rxr protein and the radiolabeled mouse r <dig> element, to test the binding specificity of the putative amphioxus rares. a black asterisk indicates that a given dr element can be recognized by the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer, as it outcompetes binding to the mouse r <dig> element




furthermore, comparisons of the conserved and validated amphioxus cyp <dig> rares with functional rares associated with vertebrate cyp <dig> genes revealed that the amphioxus dr5- <dig> sequence located upstream of cyp26- <dig>  is identical in sequence to a dr <dig> rare located upstream of vertebrate cyp26a <dig> genes   <cit> . to verify, whether this dr <dig> rare motif is a chordate innovation or an ancestral signature of bilaterian cyp <dig> genes, we screened the genomic regions surrounding cyp <dig> genes in the annelid c. teleta, the mollusk l. gigantea, the echinoderm s. purpuratus, the hemichordate s. kowalevskii, and three vertebrates . while no dr <dig> rare with a similar motif could be identified in the annelid c. teleta and the mollusk l. gigantea, the conserved dr <dig> rare was recovered in all three vertebrate species as well as in the hemichordate s. kowalevskii. intriguingly, in the echinoderm s. purpuratus, instead of a dr <dig> rare, we found a dr <dig> rare with two similar dr sequences  in an inverse orientation relative to the conserved dr <dig> rares in other species . of note, the conserved amphioxus dr <dig> rare is located significantly further away from the cyp <dig> start codon than in the other studied species. although the biological significance of this finding still remains to be explored, these results nonetheless suggest that the direct control of cyp <dig> expression by ra signaling, mediated at least in part by a conserved dr <dig> rare, is an ancestral feature that was most likely absent in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians and that was thus only subsequently acquired at the base of the deuterostomes.table  <dig> conserved retinoic acid response elements  with the characteristic sequence signature agttca5agttca identified in the vicinity of bilaterian cyp <dig> genes

discussion
cyp <dig> genes and their evolutionary involvement in ra-dependent a-p patterning in chordates
in this study, we assessed the developmental expression patterns and the biological functions of the three cyp <dig> duplicates from the european amphioxus b. lanceolatum. globally, our results suggest a sub-functionalization of these genes. of the three genes, cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> are characterized by weak and disperse expression patterns, while cyp26- <dig> displays a dynamic, tissue-specific pattern along the a-p axis. considering that a-p patterning in early stages of amphioxus development is dependent on ra signaling  <cit> , the expression profile of cyp26- <dig>  at very distinct positions along the a-p axis of the gastrula and early neurula, is suggestive of a functional role for this gene in this ra-dependent patterning process. this notion is further supported by the results obtained by pharmacological inhibition of cyp <dig> action during gastrulation, which yielded embryos and larvae that resemble those treated with exogenous ra, displaying severe a-p patterning defects  <cit> . thus, we propose that cyp <dig> enzymes assume two main functions during amphioxus development , which are equivalent to those observed in vertebrates:  the mediation of ra-dependent developmental patterning and  the protection against fluctuations of ra levels. due to its conspicuous and tissue-specific expression during development, we hypothesize that the former is mainly assumed by cyp26- <dig>  while the latter is dependent on the activity of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> fig.  <dig> model for regulation and function of cyp <dig> genes in amphioxus. the position of the functionally validated retinoic acid response elements  within the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster is indicated relative to the start codons of the three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes . the relative expression of each of the genes is indicated during normal development  as well as during exposure to ra , hence highlighting the dominance of cyp26- <dig> during normal development and the importance of cyp26- <dig> and cyp26- <dig> for protection against ra teratogenesis




during early development, the expression domains of cyp26- <dig> along the a-p axis are inversely correlated with those of hox <dig> and hnf3- <dig>  both of which are direct targets of ra signaling in amphioxus  <cit> . the posterior expression limit of cyp26- <dig> in anterior tissues thus abuts the anterior border of both the hox <dig> and hnf3- <dig> domains  <cit> . concomitantly, the blastopore-associated expression of cyp26- <dig> seems to delineate the posterior limits of both hox <dig> and hnf3- <dig>  <cit> . given that rar expression is ubiquitous during gastrulation  <cit> , the presence of cyp26- <dig> in defined domains along the a-p axis might thus be crucial for the creation of ra sinks to subdivide the developing embryo into zones with and without active ra signaling. this is reminiscent of the conserved expression and function of cyp26a <dig> during vertebrate gastrulation: cyp26a <dig> is expressed in the anterior neural ectoderm and functions to establish a-p boundaries in the developing cns  <cit> . it does so by establishing an anterior sink for ra produced posteriorly in the paraxial mesoderm, hence creating a ra gradient along the a-p axis of the neuroectoderm  <cit> .

by the mid neurula stage, the cyp26- <dig> signal is present in the entire anterior cns, with a posterior limit at the boundary between the first and second somite. this cyp <dig> expression is hence limited to a region homologous to the vertebrate forebrain and midbrain  <cit> , which is considerably different from what is observed in the vertebrate cns, where cyp <dig> genes are expressed in the developing hindbrain and are fundamental for its patterning along the a-p axis  <cit> . in the amphioxus hindbrain homolog, ra signaling mediated by rar/rxr has been shown to confer regional identity along the a-p axis by controlling the collinear expression of hox genes  <cit> . however, our work suggests that, in contrast to the situation in vertebrates, this process does not involve the deployment of cyp <dig> genes in the amphioxus hindbrain homolog. thus, while the early role for cyp <dig> in neural patterning was probably already present in the last common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates, a cyp26-dependent mechanism for subsequent hindbrain regionalization probably evolved in vertebrates, following the vertebrate-specific cyp <dig> duplications.

following neurulation, the three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes are expressed in anterior mesoderm, most noticeably in the anterior-most somites. this is intriguing, as to date there is no convincing evidence for a requirement of ra signaling in amphioxus mesoderm development  <cit>  and the inhibition of cyp <dig> function by pharmacological treatments does not yield a mesodermal phenotype  <cit> . these observations raise an important question: why are cyp <dig> genes expressed in the anterior amphioxus mesoderm, as they are in vertebrate head mesoderm  <cit> , if they are not required for a-p patterning of this tissue? we speculate that the conspicuous expression of cyp <dig> in the anterior somites is an amphioxus innovation and is thus not comparable to the role of cyp <dig> in the vertebrate head mesoderm. instead, the cyp <dig> genes might function in the anterior amphioxus mesoderm to establish a buffer zone between the cns dorsally and the pharynx ventrally, which require distinct ra signaling cues for a-p regionalization  <cit> . although further analyses aiming, for example, at the visualization of in vivo ra signaling levels  <cit>  will be required to test this hypothesis, it would nonetheless be interesting to assess, whether this mechanism for separating two gradient-based a-p patterning systems is being used more widely during development of small-sized embryos.

in the course of development, the blastopore-associated expression of amphioxus cyp26- <dig> becomes incorporated into the tail bud, a structure that, from the neurula stage on, plays a central role in posterior elongation of the embryo and larva and that is further characterized by the expression of tissue-specific marker genes, such as wnt <dig>  <cit> . in vertebrates, both cyp26a <dig> and wnt3a are also co-expressed in the developing tail bud, and cyp26a <dig> null mutants are characterized by a truncated tail and a spatial expression of wnt3a that is abnormally restricted towards the midline of the posterior neural plate  <cit> . these observations suggest that, in the vertebrate tail bud, cyp26a <dig> functions to keep ra levels low to create a permissive environment required for the posterior elongation of the embryo  <cit> . in contrast, in amphioxus, treatments with cyp <dig> inhibitor, exogenous ra or the rar antagonist bms <dig> do not affect expression of wnt <dig> in the tail bud  <cit> . importantly, these pharmacological treatments, albeit affecting tail fin development, also do not impact posterior elongation of the developing embryo  <cit> . together, these findings support the notion that cyp <dig> function, and more generally the ra signaling system, is not required for tail bud-driven body extension in amphioxus and that this role for ra likely evolved in the vertebrate lineage.

cyp <dig> activity is required for the development of the amphioxus tail fin
previous studies in the florida amphioxus, b. floridae, have shown that the administration of excess ra during gastrulation results in a small anus  <cit>  and that the continuous administration of ra to b. floridae larvae leads to closure of the anus and regression of the tail fin  <cit> . our data on the european amphioxus, b. lanceolatum, are consistent with these previous findings and further suggest that ra signaling is required for proper tail fin outgrowth. given that cyp26- <dig> is the only b. lanceolatum cyp <dig> gene expressed in the posterior ectoderm, it is very likely responsible for fine-tuning endogenous ra signaling levels in this territory.

the amphioxus tail fin is established by columnar epidermal cells that contain a large ciliary rootlet  <cit>  and it has previously been shown that ra promotes the downregulation of a major component of this structure, the protein rootletin  <cit> . this downregulation in turn is likely responsible for the induction of tail fin regression upon ra treatments in b. floridae larvae  <cit> . our results of ra and cyp <dig> inhibitor treatments in b. lanceolatum are generally consistent with these previous observations, although we identified a major difference in the developmental timing of the involvement of ra signaling in tail fin outgrowth between the two amphioxus species. this fact is exemplified by the experimental setups required to obtain tail fin phenotypes. while in b. floridae ra-dependent tail fin malformations can only be obtained by continuous treatment of pre-metamorphic larvae with 6– <dig> gill slits  <cit> , changes in tail fin morphology can be induced much earlier during b. lanceolatum development by treating in the course of gastrulation. this suggests that, albeit required for tail fin outgrowth in both amphioxus species, the attenuation of high ra signaling levels in the posterior ectoderm might take place earlier in b. lanceolatum than in b. floridae development. it is possible that this developmental difference is mediated by a delayed activation of the expression of cyp26- <dig> in b. floridae relative to b. lanceolatum, although additional work is required to support this claim. altogether, these results indicate that amphioxus tail fin development requires low levels of ra signaling, which are maintained by cyp <dig> activity. when compared to the known functions of cyp <dig> in vertebrates, where cells expressing cyp <dig> enzymes are said to be effectively devoid of ra  <cit> , amphioxus tail fin outgrowth might represent a rare example of a developmental process, where cyp <dig> is deployed to merely reduce, and not to completely eliminate, ra signaling levels.

amphioxus cyp <dig> genes are highly responsive ra signaling targets
in vertebrates, it has been established that, in ra-sensitive tissues, ra induces cyp <dig> to generate a negative feedback loop that reduces the overall amount of available ra  <cit> . in mice, for example, expression of both cyp26a <dig> and cyp26b <dig> is upregulated upon ra treatment  <cit>  and, at least for cyp26a <dig>  this regulation is directly mediated by rar/rxr binding to rares in the vicinity of the cyp26a <dig> gene  <cit> . in contrast, the vertebrate cyp26c <dig> gene is likely not contributing to this ra-dependent negative feedback system, as its expression is actually downregulated upon ra stimulation  <cit> . the data presented here suggest that expression of all three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes, which are lineage-specific duplicates and located in a single cluster in the genome, is positively regulated by ra signaling. accordingly, the transcriptional regulation of b. lanceolatum cyp26- <dig>  cyp26- <dig>  and cyp26- <dig> is in all likelihood directly mediated by rar/rxr heterodimers, given that one dr2-type sequence and  <dig> dr5-type elements within the cyp <dig> cluster are recognized and bound by the b. lanceolatum rar/rxr heterodimer in vitro. of these  <dig> in vitro validated rares, four dr <dig> elements are located around the cyp26- <dig> coding sequence, four dr <dig> and one dr <dig> are found in proximity of cyp26- <dig>  and four dr <dig> elements are associated with the cyp26- <dig> gene. although each of the three amphioxus cyp <dig> genes are likely to be directly regulated by ra signaling, the specific arrangement of rares relative to the cyp <dig> orfs nonetheless suggests that the expression of each of the three genes is regulated independently by different sets of rares. although this fundamental difference in the regulation of amphioxus and vertebrate cyp <dig> genes remains to be demonstrated mechanistically in vivo, it is nonetheless tempting to speculate that alterations in the regulation by ra have been key for redefining the functions of the different cyp <dig> genes following their duplication, hence leading to their genomic retention by sub-functionalization.

at least some of the rares within the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster might serve as hubs for long-range regulation of gene expression from shared rares. although in both amphioxus and vertebrates it has previously been shown that functional rares are generally located in the proximity of genes directly regulated by ra signaling  <cit> , long-range regulatory mechanisms of ra signaling have, for example, been implicated in the control of the rostral expansion of posterior hoxb genes during mouse cns development  <cit> . the in vivo validation of the rares located within the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster will shed light on their contribution to short- and/or long-range transcriptional control mechanisms exerted by ra signaling. our in silico analyses further revealed the presence, within the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster, of two dr <dig> elements in close proximity of one of the in vitro validated dr <dig> elements. although dr <dig> elements are generally not recognized by rar/rxr heterodimers, they are bound by other nuclear receptors, such as vitamin d receptors  <cit> . the presence of dr <dig> elements within the amphioxus cyp <dig> cluster thus hints at the possibility that additional nuclear receptors are involved in the regulation of amphioxus cyp <dig> genes.

interestingly, the consensus sequence of the in vitro validated amphioxus dr <dig> rares is identical to the classical vertebrate dr <dig> sequence consensus   <cit> , suggesting that the dna binding properties of amphioxus and vertebrate rar/rxr heterodimers are highly conserved. along these lines, we found a similar, conserved dr <dig> rare in the regulatory region of a hemichordate cyp <dig> gene as well as an equivalent dr <dig> rare close to the cyp <dig> gene of a sea urchin. whether these elements are recognized by rar/rxr heterodimers in these two species is currently unknown. their presence is nevertheless highly suggestive of a biological function  <cit> , which thus indicates that direct regulation of cyp <dig> genes by ra signaling is an ancestral feature that was already present in the last common ancestor of all deuterostomes. in contrast, the lack of conserved rares in the regulatory regions of the cyp <dig> genes of lophotrochozoans, which generally encode rar and rxr genes in their genomes  <cit> , support the notion that the direct regulation of cyp <dig> transcription by ra signaling is not an ancestral feature of bilaterian animals. this hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that rars of gastropod mollusks are unable to bind ra and hence to activate transcription in its presence  <cit> .

the evolutionary history of cyp <dig> genes
in the animal kingdom, the basic molecular components of the ra machinery have previously been described in a wide variety of bilaterian animals, including both protostomes and deuterostomes  <cit> . genes encoding the ra degrading enzyme cyp <dig> have, for example, been identified in the genomes of priapulids, brachiopods, mollusks, annelids, sea urchins, hemichordates, cephalochordates, ascidian tunicates, and vertebrates, but not in those of nematodes and arthropods, suggesting a secondary loss of cyp <dig> subfamily genes in these two animal lineages  <cit> . we also found evidence for possible secondary losses of cyp <dig> genes in different vertebrates, including the lamprey p. marinus , the chimera c. milii , the skate l. erinacea , the coelacanth latimeria chalumnae , and the opossum monodelphis domestica  . additional sequence information will be required to validate the absence of these genes from their respective genomes and to assess, at which point in evolution the confirmed gene losses occurred.

our data further indicate that the evolutionary diversification of the vertebrate cyp <dig> genes was a highly complex process. given the presence of at least one cyp26a <dig> and two cyp26b1/c <dig> genes in lampreys, the last common ancestor of cyclostomes and gnathostomes probably already possessed at least two cyp <dig> genes. intriguingly, in the lamprey l. japonicum, cyp26a <dig> and one of the two cyp26b1/c <dig>  cyp26b1/c1a, are physically linked in a tandem cluster in the genome  , just like cyp26a <dig> and cyp26c <dig> in gnathostome genomes  <cit> . this tandem cluster thus very likely originated before the cyclostome-gnathostome split, probably by a tandem duplication event predating the vertebrate-specific wgd. the two linked cyp <dig> genes were then duplicated during the first wgd, which took place in the basal vertebrate lineage before the cyclostome-gnathostome split . the subsequent loss of one of the duplicated cyp26a <dig> genes yielded the cyp <dig> complement of extant lampreys, such as l. japonicum: one cyp26a <dig> and two cyp26b1/c <dig> genes. in the gnathostome lineage, additional duplications  resulted in the diversification of cyp26b <dig> and cyp26c <dig> genes from the ancestral cyp26b1/c <dig>  although requiring additional scrutiny, this proposed scenario for vertebrate cyp <dig> diversification suggests that, if two rounds of wgd occurred in the course of vertebrate evolution, the first likely took place before and the second after the cyclostome-gnathostome split  <cit> . alternatively, a single, ancient wgd might have occurred before the cyclostome-gnathostome split and was followed by independent segmental duplications in the cyclostome and gnathostome lineages  <cit> . interestingly, in teleost fish, which underwent an additional round of wgd  <cit> , there are also only three cyp <dig> genes, one member of each gnathostome paralogy group , and synteny analyses have revealed that the teleost-specific cyp <dig> duplicates have been non-functionalized in the course of evolution, in accordance with the ddc model  <cit> .

our phylogenetic analyses also provided evidence that cyp <dig> genes underwent multiple duplication events, not only in vertebrates, but also in invertebrates, such as cephalochordates, ascidian tunicates, hemichordates, mollusks, annelids, brachiopods, and priapulids. together, these results suggest that the ancestral bilaterian possessed a single cyp <dig> gene that was subjected to independent duplication events in different animal lineages. by correlating the timing of the lineage-specific duplications of invertebrate cyp <dig> genes with the geological timescale, we observed that the duplication events fall within three distinct time periods, i.e. the late ordovician, the early carboniferous, and the middle permian/middle triassic. thus, the priapulid cyp <dig> duplication took place during the late ordovician, the first cephalochordate duplication and that identified in the hemichordate s. kowalevskii in the early carboniferous, and the second cephalochordate duplication and that in the hemichordate p.flava in the middle permian/middle triassic. during the late ordovician, a period marked by a mass extinction of marine species  <cit> , earth was characterized by a rising level of atmospheric o <dig>  <cit>  and by vast shallow and warm continental seas  <cit> . these conditions were very favorable for the appearance of cyanobacterial mats at moderate depths of the water column  <cit> . similarly, during the early carboniferous atmospheric o <dig> levels were rising  <cit> , and the fossil record accounts for one of the highest concentrations of calcified marine cyanobacteria  <cit> . the middle permian/middle triassic, in turn, saw the greatest biotic crisis in earth’s history  <cit> , and the fossil record suggests that, as a result of environmental changes, cyanobacteria became one of the most abundant life forms in both shallow and deep water environments  <cit> .

extant cyanobacteria that are known to create massive blooms under the exact same environmental conditions include trichodesmium, anabaena, and synechocystis  <cit> , all of which are also known to produce high levels of carotenoids and retinoids as anti-oxidative byproducts, which have been shown to induce teratogenic effects in the surrounding fauna . the prevalence of cyanobacterial mats in marine environments during the late ordovician, early carboniferous, and the middle permian/middle triassic might thus explain why cyp <dig> duplications that occurred during these two geological periods were independently retained, by either neo- or sub-functionalization  <cit> , in the genomes of different marine animal lineages. the independent duplication of cyp <dig> genes might have increased the overall fitness of a given population by favoring individuals that were more efficient in buffering fluctuations of exogenous retinoid levels. altogether, this finding represents an intriguing example of adaptive convergent evolution in response to environmental changes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we characterized the expression, function, and regulation of cyp <dig> genes during amphioxus development. our data suggest that, despite the independent origins of the cyp <dig> gene repertoires in chordates, the cyp <dig> genes of cephalochordates and vertebrates convergently evolved similar developmental functions: ra-dependent patterning and homeostatic regulation of ra levels. moreover, by comparing the regulatory regions of cyp <dig> genes in three amphioxus species with those from several different animal taxa, we identified a highly conserved, functional rare, suggesting that negative feedback regulation of ra signaling is an evolutionary ancient mechanism for controlling endogenous ra levels. this mechanism of regulation was likely already present in the last common ancestor of all deuterostomes, but not in that of all bilaterians. finally, the correlation between the timing of lineage-specific duplications of bilaterian cyp <dig> genes and major environmental changes in the geological record suggest that the evolutionary diversification of the cyp <dig> subfamily in bilaterians was strongly influenced by environmental pressures to buffer fluctuations of exogenous retinoid levels. in sum, this work thus sheds light on the evolution of the regulation of endogenous ra levels and establishes a framework for studying adaptive convergent evolutionary changes following gene duplication.
