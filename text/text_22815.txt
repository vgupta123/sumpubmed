BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum encompasses diverse anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that are defined by the production of one, two or three botulinum neurotoxins   <cit> . the botulinum neurotoxin produces a flaccid paralysis known as botulism that affects humans, other mammals, birds and fish  <cit> . there are seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxins, bont/a–g, produced by six known groups of clostridia  <cit> . recently, sequencing of an infant botulism isolate has also identified an unusual toxin type  that is produced in combination with bont/b  <cit> . group i includes bont/a,/b and/f-producing strains; group ii includes bont/b,/e and/f-producing strains; group iii includes bont/c and/d-producing strains; group iv includes the bont/g-producing c. argentinense strains; group v includes the bont/f-producing c. baratii strains; and group vi includes the bont/e-producing c. butyricum strains  <cit> . bont/a–g are ~35–70 % different  from each other and can vary within a toxin type  <cit> . the variants within a serotype are described by a numerical designation following the toxin such as a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  etc. thus, bont-producing bacteria are members of at least four different bacterial species, as well as several well-defined subclades, that contain a large diversity of toxin types.

numerous recombination events between toxins have been documented  <cit> , and bivalent toxin combinations within the same strain have been identified  <cit> . strains in different groups can produce the same toxin . horizontal gene transfer of the toxin gene between strains in the six groups via toxin gene associations with transposases such as insertion sequence  elements, recombinases, the acquisition of plasmids or infection by phage  is supported by incongruent topologies between the bont gene and 16s rrna gene phylogenies as well as the presence of the same toxin subtype on the chromosome in some strains and on plasmids in other strains  <cit> . recombination among toxins and horizontal gene transfer between different species and/or groups therefore allow for substantial variation in botulinum neurotoxins and in the genomic backgrounds in which the same toxin type or subtype are found. thus, capturing data for both the genomic background as well as the toxin type provides valuable information about the diversity within bont-producing species/groups and how this genetic and phenotypic variation is generated.

group designations were initially established based upon biochemical and microbiological attributes of the bacteria, though the group designations and the genetic variation of the bacteria and the toxin have been increasingly investigated using different molecular techniques  <cit> . the first genomic sequence of a bont-producing strain, c. botulinum atcc  <dig>  was used to develop microarrays to query group i strains  <cit> . later the whole genomic sequence of eklund 17b was used to construct a dna microarray and query group ii strains  <cit> . these microarray studies identified diversity in the bacteria that express the botulinum toxin and identified clades of bacteria within their collections that shared common genes. amplified fragment-length polymorphism  analysis has been used to examine the diversity of group i  <cit>  and ii strains  <cit>  and to identify the complexity of  <dig> strains of neurotoxin-producing clostridia primarily from california infant botulism cases  <cit> . pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  has been used to examine bont-producing strains  <cit> , including the determination of toxin gene cluster variation and location  of bont/b variants  <cit> . multi-locus sequence typing  has been used to differentiate group i serotype a strains  <cit>  and group ii serotype e strains  <cit> . these various genetic methods provide a baseline of understanding of phylogenetic relationships among clostridia species. improved dna sequencing technologies and bioinformatic techniques now available allow researchers to compare strains at a higher level of resolution.

botulinum neurotoxin-producing clostridia have been identified from all continents except antarctica. these microbes are often isolated from samples associated with human botulism cases , and researchers have also isolated bont-producing clostridia from environmental samples including soils, honey, aquatic sediments and plants . the distribution of serotypes a–g can be obtained from publications based upon characterization of strains within different culture collections, environmental sampling and reported botulism cases. identifying bont-producing strains from sources around the globe aids in understanding the frequency and geographic distribution of strains containing various toxin types.

the study represents a collaborative effort among researchers at many institutions to understand the diversity within bont-producing clostridia. the study provides genomic sequence data and draft genome assemblies for strains  representing diverse serotypes and geographic regions including isolates from botulism cases and environmental sources from argentina, australia, canada, finland, france, greenland, japan, mauritius, sweden and the us. these data are useful for determining neurotoxin gene cluster characteristics of bont-produding strains, the genomic backgrounds containing botulinum toxin genes, and the global distribution of strains expressing different toxin types. the study demonstrates that comparative genomic techniques differentiate bont-producing strains  and illustrates the diversity of bont-producing strains . knowledge of the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of bont-producing strains provides a framework for the study of these bacteria and can inform future research regarding topics such as the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutics.

methods
genome sequencing, assembly and annotation
strains or purified dna were kindly provided by numerous collaborators. whole genome sequence data were generated with the illumina sequencing technology . genomes were assembled de novo via an in-house pipeline  <cit>  that included adapter trimming with trimmomatic  <cit> , read error correction with bayeshammer  <cit>  and contig assembly with spades v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . redundant contigs were removed with psi-cd-hit  <cit> , and short contigs  were filtered out of assemblies. illumina reads were mapped back to assemblies with bwa  <cit> , and single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified with gatk  <cit>  and corrected if they passed a minimum depth and allele proportion. assemblies were then improved with pilon  <cit>  and image  <cit> . assemblies were screened for obvious contamination by blast  <cit>  searches against the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database . relevant, published clostridia species genomes were identified with the aid of the patric database phylogeny viewer  <cit>  and literature searches. genome assemblies were downloaded from patric  <cit>  or genbank  <cit>  in fasta format . the genome assembly of acetobacter woodii dsm  <dig>  was downloaded for use as an outgroup. for inclusion in analyses, published genome assemblies needed to meet the following requirements: < <dig> contigs, presence of a near full-length 16s rrna gene  and presence of an rpob gene. all genome assemblies  were annotated with prokka  <cit>  and evaluated with quast  <cit> . in addition to published genome assemblies, read files for ten group i c. botulinum  <cit>  genomes were included for the core genome sequence phylogenies of group i strains.

16s rrna gene phylogeny
16s rrna genes were parsed from prokka output files. if multiple 16s rrna gene sequences were present in an assembly, the sequences from that assembly were clustered  with usearch  <cit>  and a representative sequence was chosen for that assembly. representative sequences were aligned and masked with ssu-align  <cit> . aligned and masked sequences were trimmed with mothur   <cit>  so the first and last position of each sequence included a base . a phylogeny was inferred with fasttree <dig>  <cit> , an approximately-maximum-likelihood method, using the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution and  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the tree was viewed and rooted with the a. woodii dsm  <dig> 16s rrna gene sequence in figtree v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

phylogeny of concatenated marker genes
forty marker genes identified by speci   <cit> , a software package developed to delineate microbial species, were extracted from prokka output files. gene sequences of sufficient length  were aligned with muscle  <cit>  and concatenated. the final alignment included gap characters for marker genes that could not be extracted from some genome assemblies. alignment columns containing greater than 95 % gap characters were filtered from the alignment with qiime v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . phylogenies were inferred on the concatenated alignments with fasttree <dig> as described above. the tree was viewed and rooted with a. woodii dsm  <dig> in figtree.

single nucleotide polymorphism  detection and phylogeny
all genome assemblies were compared with the reference-independent single nucleotide polymorphism  approach, ksnp v <dig>  <cit> . ksnp was run with a kmer value of  <dig>  snps identified in at least 50 % of the analyzed genomes were used to infer a phylogeny. a phylogeny was inferred on the  <dig> -character matrix with fasttree <dig> as described above. reference-independent snp phylogenies were also generated for group i and ii strains. the group i and ii phylogenies were inferred upon core snp matrices  generated by ksnp, as described above.

snp discovery was also performed by aligning assembled genomes to a reference assembly with nucmer  <cit>  and identifying snps from these alignments with nasp  <cit> . illumina reads for ten group i strains were aligned against the reference with bwa-mem  <cit>  and snps were called with the unifiedgenotyper method in gatk  <cit> . snp calls were filtered from the final matrix if the coverage at a position was less than 10× or if the proportion of reads matching the called snp was less than  <dig> . snps called from duplicated regions in the reference genome  were filtered from the snp matrix. phylogenies were inferred with raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution and the gamma distribution of rate heterogeneity. ascertainment bias correction was applied to likelihood calculations  <cit>  within raxml. bootstrap replicates were conducted using the rapid bootstrapping method in raxml  <cit> , and the number of bootstrap replicates was determined by using the raxml extended majority-rule consensus tree criterion  <cit> . the tree was viewed and rooted in figtree. c. botulinum strain kyoto-f  was used as the reference genome for snp detection for group i c. botulinum/c. sporogenes resulting in a  <dig> -character core genome snp matrix called from a  <dig> ,420-character core genome alignment . the core genome phylogeny for group i was rooted with the clade including c. sporogenes and c. botulinum serotype b strains based upon the concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies of all genomes included in this study as well as reference-based snp phylogenies including c. tetani strains as an outgroup . c. botulinum strain eklund 17b  was used as the reference genome for snp detection for group ii c. botulinum resulting in a  <dig> -character snp matrix called from a  <dig> ,405-character core genome alignment. the core genome phylogeny for group ii was rooted with the clade containing strains eklund 202f, kapb- <dig>  eklund 17b and cdc  <dig> based upon the concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies of all the genomes included in this study as well as reference-based snp phylogenies including c. saccharobutylicum dsm  <dig>  as an outgroup . reference-based snp detection and core genome phylogenies with alternate reference genomes were also generated: group i – c. sporogenes atcc  <dig> , group ii – c. botulinum strain alaska e <dig> .

analysis of phylogenies
the consistency index and retention index for core genome phylogenies was computed with the r  <cit>  package phangorn  <cit> . compare2trees  <cit>  was used to compare tree topologies for groups i and ii core genome phylogenies and for 16s rrna gene, concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies. the overall topological score is reported as a measure of tree topology similarity.

snp and homoplasy density in c. botulinum groups i and ii
snp density and homoplasy density ratio were computed using the snp matrices and core genome phylogenies produced by nasp and raxml  to provide insight into recombination within groups i and ii. snp density was determined by counting the number of parsimony informative snps present in 1 kb non-overlapping segments of the core genome for each group. the homoplasy density ratio was computed by dividing the number of parsimony informative snps with a retention index below  <dig>   by the total number of parsimony informative snps in 1 kb segments of the core genome for each group. the snp density and homoplasy density ratio values across the reference genomes were plotted with circos  <cit> . histograms of the homoplasy density ratio values of 1 kb segments of the core genome  are presented for groups i and ii.

pairwise genomic comparisons – average nucleotide identity
the average nucleotide identity between pairs of genome assemblies  was computed with jspecies  <cit>  using the mummer calculation  and default settings. a histogram of anim values of inter- and intra-group comparisons of c. botulinum groups i, ii, iii and vi as well as c. perfringens and c. tetani was created with matplotlib  <cit> . these groups were chosen for comparison because they contain strains that produce botulinum neurotoxins or the tetanus toxin and/or have multiple sequenced genomes within the group/species.

gene content analyses with ls-bsr
genome assemblies were processed with the large-scale blast score ratio pipeline   <cit>  using the blat  <cit>  alignment option and default parameters to assess the gene content of group i and ii strains. group i and ii genomes were clustered based on bsr values using an average linkage algorithm implemented in the multiexperiment viewer   <cit> . dendrograms produced by mev were viewed and rooted in figtree. additionally, cold shock protein encoding genes were screened against group ii genomes using the ls-bsr approach. cold shock protein encoding genes were downloaded from patric  <cit>  for c. botulinum strains atcc  <dig> , eklund 17b  and eklund  as well as c. beijerinckii strain ncimb  <dig> , and c. butyricum strains  <dig>  and bl <dig> .

phylogeny of concatenated multi-locus sequence typing  genes
genes for multilocus-sequence typing  were selected from previous mslt studies. the mlst profile for group i strains  was selected from jacobson and colleagues  <cit> . the mlst profile for group ii strains  was adapted from macdonald and colleagues  <cit> , though 23s rrna gene sequences were not included in the analysis. these gene sequences were downloaded from pubmlst c. botulinum database  <cit>  or genbank. mlst genes were extracted from genome assemblies with blast searches. gene sequences were aligned with muscle and concatenated for phylogenetic reconstruction. phylogenies were inferred with fasttree <dig> as described above . two genome assemblies included in the group i analyses were missing one gene from the mlst profile – c. botulinum cdc  <dig> had no reca gene and c. botulinum af <dig> had no mdh gene. gap characters were inserted into the gene alignments for these two genomes.

bont gene cluster analyses
botulinum neurotoxin gene sequences were extracted from prokka output files. previously published bont gene and tetanus toxin gene sequences downloaded from genbank were also included in the analyses. sequences longer than  <dig> nucleotides were aligned with muscle and trimmed with mothur  so the first and last position of each sequence included a base . a phylogeny was constructed with fasttree <dig> as described above . the tree was viewed and rooted with the tetanus toxin gene clade in figtree. annotated genome assemblies were investigated to determine the putative bont gene cluster type  and location within the genome. newly sequenced genomes were aligned to previously published genome assemblies with progressivemauve  <cit>  to aid in understanding putative bont gene cluster locations. the presence of a plasmid-specific marker gene  in all genome assemblies was determined with blast searches  of assembled genomes against a putative dna primase gene   <cit> .

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> new draft genome assemblies were generated for strains isolated from six different continents ). the strains were previously isolated from botulism cases and environmental samples and include  <dig> bont/a, six bont/b, nine bont/e, one bont/f, five bont/a <dig>  two bivalent bont/a2f <dig>  one bivalent bont/bf and three strains that did not contain botulinum neurotoxin genes in the draft genome assemblies . information regarding previously published genomes included in this study is presented . fig.  <dig> illustrates the countries of origin of bont-producing strains sequenced and/or analyzed in this study and demonstrates the small number of whole genome sequences available for strains originating from asia and africa. this study is one of the most comprehensive comparative genomic analyses of c. botulinum and closely-related strains performed to date.table  <dig> information regarding newly sequenced strains

delineation of clostridia species/groups
the phylogenetic relationships and diversity of bont-producing strains were evaluated with phylogenies of the 16s rrna gene, concatenated marker genes, and snps and with average nucleotide identity. a phylogeny of 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from each genome assembly indicates that the newly sequenced strains  are closely related to strains within c. botulinum groups i and ii . group i includes serotypes a, b and f as well as bivalent and non-toxic strains. group ii includes serotypes b, e and f. bont-producing strains are color-coded by serotype in fig.  <dig>  which illustrates evidence of horizontal gene transfer and that non-bont-producing strains are closely related to bont-producing strains .fig.  <dig> 16s rrna gene phylogeny of clostridia strains. a phylogeny inferred with fasttree <dig>  <cit>  on near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences extracted from genome assemblies and aligned and masked with ssu-align  <cit> . the tree is rooted with acetobacter woodii dsm  <dig> . strains are color-coded by botulinum neurotoxin serotype. stars indicate newly sequenced  strains. groups i–vi, clostridium perfringens and c. tetani clades are labeled. gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 90 %



the deeper relationships of bont-producing clostridia strains were also evaluated with phylogenies inferred on a concatenation of  <dig> marker genes identified by mende and colleagues  <cit>  for delineation of species  and a snp-matrix produced by ksnp . the 16s rrna gene, concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies show similar overall topologies . all phylogenies indicate that group iii c. botulinum strains are an outgroup to all other bont-producing strains and that a close relationship exists between c. tetani strains and c. botulinum group i strains. the concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies provide greater resolution than the 16s rrna gene phylogeny and indicate that multiple clades are present in c. botulinum groups i, ii and iii, which is consistent with previous findings . among the biggest differences between the trees is the inclusion of the group iv c. argentinense strain in a clade with the group i strains in the 16s rrna gene and ksnp trees, while the same group iv c. argentinense strain falls into a clade with groups ii, v, vi in the concatenated marker genes phylogeny.fig.  <dig> phylogenies of clostridia strains inferred on  concatenated marker genes and  a snp matrix. phylogenies inferred with fasttree <dig>  <cit>  on   <dig> concatenated marker genes for the delineation of species   <cit>  aligned with muscle  <cit>  and  a snp-matrix including snps identified in at least 50 % of the analyzed strains produced by ksnp v <dig>  <cit> . the trees are rooted with acetobacter woodii dsm  <dig> . strains are color-coded by botulinum neurotoxin serotype. groups i-vi, clostridium perfringens and c. tetani clades are labeled. gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 90 %



average nucleotide identity , a method that can be applied to delineate species  <cit> , was calculated to determine diversity at the genomic level within and between bont-producing groups ). richter and rossello-mora  <cit>  suggested that anim values above 95–96 % may be applied to define species, though the authors noted some exceptions, and anim values between  <dig> and 96 % may fall into an intermediate zone of species classification  <cit> . minimum anim values in groups i, ii and iii fall below the threshold of 95–96 %, and minimum anim values for group i and group iii fall below 93 %, which is indicative of the relatively high diversity within these groups  <cit> . for comparison, the minimum anim values for strains within c. perfingens and c. tetani  are well above the suggested species cutoff value, and looking outside of the clostridia, escherichia coli o157:h <dig> str. ec <dig> and e. fergusonii atcc  <dig> share  <dig>  anim . multiple clades are present in c. botulinum groups i and ii in the concatenated marker genes and ksnp phylogenies  as well as in core genome phylogenies . while minimum anim values fall below the species delineation value when all genomes in either group i or group ii are considered, anim values are above 95 % within each of the two distinct clades present in group i, and anim values are above 97 % within each of the two distinct clades present in group ii. by this measure, both groups i and ii could be considered to encompass multiple species, subspecies or genomovars   <cit> . regardless of the assigned nomenclature, the genomic diversity within the groups is evident.fig.  <dig> pairwise genomic comparisons with average nucleotide identity. a a dendrogram highlighting clades of clostridia compared by the average nucleotide identity  method  with jspecies  <cit>  and included in the histogram presented in . b a histogram of inter-group and intra-group anim values. the vertical dotted line at 95 % nucleotide identity indicates the cutoff for species delineation suggested by richter and rosello-mora  <cit> . the inset table displays maximum and minimum percent nucleotide identity within each analyzed clade and between all analyzed clades



phylogeny of group i c. botulinum/c. sporogenes
many of the newly sequenced strains belong to the group i c. botulinum/c. sporogenes. to provide a high-resolution investigation of the relationships of  <dig> group i strains, a maximum likelihood phylogeny was estimated from an alignment of ~ <dig>  core genome snps . core genome phylogenies generated with an alternative reference genome as well as ksnp are also presented . group i includes diverse bont/a,/b and/f-producing strains as well as non-bont-producing strains that fall into multiple clades, which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . when considering anim values, strains within the c. sporogenes-bont/b-producing outgroup  share anim values above 95 %. the strains in the remainder of the tree also share anim values above 95 %. however, when comparing all group i strains anim values fall below 95 %  , indicating the high genomic diversity present in group i. the core genome phylogeny provides a framework for investigating group i strains including the variation in genomic backgrounds expressing the same toxin type or subtype.fig.  <dig> group i core genome phylogeny. core genome phylogeny of c. botulinum group i inferred with raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the asc_gtrgamma model on an alignment of  <dig>  core genome snps produced with nasp  <cit>  using c. botulinum strain kyoto-f  as a reference genome. the consistency index is  <dig> , and the retention index is  <dig> . gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 95 %. the phylogeny was rooted with the clade that includes clostridium sporogenes and c. botulinum b serotypes  using figtree  <cit> . strains are color-coded by botulinum neurotoxin serotype. additional information regarding bont gene cluster characteristics is included in table 1




bont/a-producing strains  belong to multiple clades of the group i core genome phylogeny presented in fig.  <dig>  subtype a <dig> strains show considerable genomic diversity. the newly sequenced orfx+ bont/a <dig> strain u <dig> from argentina belongs to a clade that includes the orfx+ bont/a <dig> strain cdc  <dig>  but is less closely related to strain cdc  <dig> than other bont/a <dig> and bivalent strains. two clades of bont/a <dig> strains  are found in the group i phylogeny. five bont/a <dig> strains  from the united states are closely related to other bont/a <dig> strains from ecuador, japan and the us while three recently published bont/a <dig> strains isolated from infant botulism cases in japan  <cit>  fall into a distinct clade. the ha+ bont/a <dig> strains included in this study belong to one clade that also includes a bont/b <dig> strain, a bont/f <dig> strain and a strain that does not contain a botulinum neurotoxin gene . three ha+ bont/a <dig> subclades include previously published genomes, but strain  <dig> isolated from spinach associated with a food botulism case in the us  is less closely related to these previously sequenced ha+ bont/a <dig> strains.

argentinian subtype bont/a <dig> strains analyzed in this study were all isolated from soils. many of the newly sequenced bont/a <dig> strains are closely related to the bont/a <dig> strain c. botulinum kyoto-f . however, the newly sequenced bont/a <dig> argentinian strains u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> form a distinct but closely related clade to the bont/a <dig> group that includes the kyoto-f strain. additionally, two newly sequenced argentinian bont/a <dig> strains  are distantly related to the previously mentioned bont/a <dig> strains, but appear to be more closely related to orfx+ bont/a <dig> and bivalent strains. one newly sequenced bont/a <dig> strain from the republic of mauritius, an island country off the eastern coast of africa, is not closely related to any of the argentinian bont/a <dig> strains or the kyoto-f strain. the diversity of the genomic backgrounds in which bont/a <dig> genes are found is evident from this analysis.

prior to this study, only one genome assembly for a strain producing bont/a <dig>  c. botulinum strain loch maree isolated in scotland  <cit> , had been published. the loch maree strain is not closely related to any other whole genome sequenced strain . two argentinian bont/a <dig> strains  sequenced as part of this study are distantly related to the loch maree strain and are most closely related to bivalent bont/af strains from argentina.

bont/b-producing strains are also found in multiple clades in the group i phylogeny. the bont/b1-producing strain  <dig> is not closely related to the published whole-genome-sequenced bont/b1-producing strain, c. botulinum okra, but instead falls within a clade that includes ha+ bont/a <dig> strains. newly sequenced bont/b2-producing strain  <dig> and bont/b3-producing strain  <dig> are not closely related to other bont/b-producing strains. the distantly related clade at the bottom of the group i core genome phylogeny includes c. sporogenes strains and c. botulinum strains that produce bont/b <dig> and/b <dig> subtypes. the newly sequenced strains include three bont/b6-producing strains from australia that are closely related to the japanese bont/b6-producing strain okayama  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, the acquisition or loss of the ability to produce bont/b within the c. sporogenes-bont/b clade appears to be plasmid-mediated, which is consistent with findings of weigand and colleagues  <cit> ; although, evaluation of additional strains would be needed to confirm this observation.

the bont/f <dig> strain  <dig>  is closely related to previously published bont/f <dig> strains f <dig> and langeland . strain  <dig> was isolated from an environmental source  while the langeland strain was isolated from duck liver paste associated with a food botulism case. the bont/f <dig> strain cdc  <dig> and bont/f <dig> strain cdc  <dig>  are found in different clades and are not closely related to the serotype f <dig> strains.

bivalent strains are found within two clades in the group i phylogeny. a clade of closely related bivalent strains is nested within the clade just above the basal clade at the bottom of fig.  <dig>  this bivalent clade includes two strains that produce both bont/a and/b  as well as the bont/b5f2-producing strains  <dig>  and bf. the second bivalent clade includes bont/a2f <dig> strains u <dig> and u <dig> from argentina that are closely related to previously published bivalent bont/a2f <dig> and trivalent bont/a2f4f <dig> strains also from argentina.

the core genome phylogeny illustrates the diversity of whole genome sequenced group i strains. mlst is a comparative method available to many laboratories that does not require whole genome sequencing. to allow for the comparison of strains included in this study with published mlst data, a phylogeny of concatenated mlst genes including  <dig> sequence types  available through the pubmlst c. botulinum database  <cit>  is included . similar to the core genome phylogeny , the concatenated mlst gene phylogeny separates the group i strains into two main clades. sequence types associated with bont-producing and non-bont-producing strains fall into both main clades. c. sporogenes and bont/b-producing strains and two sequence types associated with serotype a strains  fall into the clade corresponding to the c. sporogenes and bont/b strain clade in the core genome phylogeny . genome assemblies were not available for the two serotype a strains in this clade that might assist in further understanding the relationships of these strains.

phylogeny of group ii c. botulinum
newly sequenced strains also included bont/e-producing isolates belonging to the group ii c. botulinum. the relationships and diversity of  <dig> group ii strains were investigated with a maximum likelihood phylogeny inferred from an alignment of ~ <dig>  core genome snps . phylogenies generated with an alternate reference genome as well as ksnp are also presented . two distinct clades are apparent in the group ii phylogeny. anim values are above 97 % within each major clade but fall below the species-delineating threshold of 95 %  when all group ii strains are considered, which illustrates the genomic diversity within the group. the two major clades include a clade of only bont/e-producing strains and a clade of bont/b,/e and/f-producing strains. the newly sequenced serotype e strains fall into a clade comprised entirely of bont/e-producing strains representing canada, finland, france, greenland, japan and the us. the second major clade includes bont/b <dig> /e <dig> and/f6-producing strains. the bont/e9-producing strain cdc  <dig> from argentina falls into the clade with bont/b and/f-producing strains from the us, which is consistent with microarray hybridization profile analysis  <cit>  and snp analysis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> group ii core genome phylogeny. core genome phylogeny of c. botulinum group ii inferred with raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the asc_gtrgamma model on an alignment of  <dig>  core genome snps produced with nasp  <cit>  using c. botulinum eklund 17b  as a reference genome. the consistency index is  <dig> , and the retention index is  <dig> . gray circles indicate bootstrap values over 95 %. the phylogeny was rooted with the clade that includes strains eklund 202f, kapb- <dig>  eklund 17b and cdc  <dig> using figtree  <cit> . strains are color-coded by botulinum neurotoxin serotype



to allow for comparison of strains included in this study with published mlst data for other strains, a phylogeny of concatenated mlst genes including  <dig> c. botulinum serotype e strains presented in macdonald et al.  <cit>  is included . similar to the core genome phylogeny, the mlst phylogeny separates the group ii strains into two main clades: one that includes only bont/e strains and one that includes bont/b and/f strains as well as the bont/e <dig> cdc <dig> strain.

snp and homoplasy density in c. botulinum groups i and ii
recombination is a common evolutionary process  <cit>  that has been detected among c. botulinum strains  <cit>  and may impact accurate phylogenetic inference. regions of the genome with high proportions of homoplasious snps  may indicate regions of recombination  <cit> . for groups i and ii, parsimony informative snps  and putative recombination, indicated by regions of the genome with high proportions of homoplasious snps, appear to be distributed throughout the core genome . a comparison of the histograms of homoplasy density ratio values for 1 kb segments of the core genomes for groups i and ii  suggests that recombination is more prevalent in group i strains as compared to group ii strains. it should be noted that fewer group ii strains were evaluated and the underlying reasons for the apparent difference in the prevalence of recombination in each group is unknown. additionally, the approach to detect recombination used here does not address potential recombination  between or within specific clades of the group i or group ii phylogenies. additional analyses could provide more information about recombined regions in bont-producing clades .fig.  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism density and homoplasy density in group i and group ii. a a map of snp density and homoplasy density in group i genomes. the outer ring displays the reference genome . blue shaded regions indicate the core genome of group i . the middle ring displays snp density , which is defined here as the number of parsimony informative snps found in 1 kb segments of the core genome. the inner ring displays the homoplasy density , which is defined as the proportion of parsimony informative snps with a retention index below  <dig>  for 1 kb segments of the core genome. b histogram displaying the counts of 1 kb genome segments with homoplasy densities between  <dig> and  <dig> for group i genomes. the vertical line indicates the median homoplasy density value. c a map of snp and homoplasy density in group ii genomes. the outer ring displays information about the reference genome . blue shaded regions indicate the core genome of group ii. the middle ring displays the snp density and the inner ring displays the homoplasy density. d histogram displaying the counts of 1 kb genome segments with homoplasy densities between  <dig> and  <dig> for group ii genomes. the vertical line indicates the median homoplasy density value. the figures suggest that snps and recombination are spread throughout the core genomes of each group

ls-bsr  <cit> , a tool for comparing the relatedness of coding sequences among genomes, was used to evaluate the genetic content of group i and ii strains and to cluster strains based upon coding sequence similarity – . dendrograms of group i and ii strains constructed by clustering bsr values with an average linkage algorithm  show similar overall strain clustering patterns as the core genome phylogenies for both groups i and ii. these clustering patterns indicate that clades identified by core genome phylogenies share coding sequence similarity. future research could investigate potential functional roles of different clades and could identify marker genes for different clades.

the ls-bsr tool was also applied to investigate the presence or absence of cold shock protein genes in group ii assemblies. söderholm and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that cold shock protein genes, which are commonly found in microbes, were absent from three group ii bont/e genome assemblies but were present in the group ii strain eklund 17b  genome. although group ii strains have been shown to grow and produce toxins at low temperatures  <cit> , the ls-bsr approach demonstrated that homologs of cold shock protein genes found in other c. botulinum genomes are absent from group ii bont/e genomes, while cold shock protein genes are present in the genomes falling into the group ii clade including bont/b,/e <dig> and/f genomes .

bont gene cluster analyses
the bont genes from each of the newly sequenced strains were evaluated to determine if there were any new variants or subtypes. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of bont gene sequences extracted from genome assemblies and previously published bont gene sequences is presented . subtype-specific clades can be seen for serotypes. recently, new bont subtypes have been identified for serotypes a  <cit>  and e  <cit> , and an unusual toxin type  was identified in an isolate from an infant botulism case  <cit> . however, bont gene sequences from newly sequenced strains in this study are closely related  to known bont subtype gene sequences, indicating that novel bont subtypes were not discovered in the newly sequenced strains.

botulinum neurotoxin genes are associated with two gene cluster types  that appear to be located at specific locations in the chromosome or within a plasmid  <cit> . information regarding the bont type and putative bont gene cluster location for draft genome assemblies is included in table  <dig>  the presence of a marker gene  for identifying bont-containing plasmids  <cit>  in all genome assemblies was determined with blast. the pl- <dig> gene was present in genome assemblies of published group i strains known to have plasmids containing bont genes  as well as newly sequenced group i strains with bont genes putatively located on plasmids . the pl- <dig> gene was not identified in assemblies that do not contain bont-containing plasmids.

the putative location of toxin gene clusters in the newly sequenced strains was examined and compared to previously published bont-producing strain genomes . the bont/a <dig> genes in ha+ gene clusters have putative chromosomal locations and are associated with oppa/brnq operons. the orfx+ bont/a <dig> gene in strain u <dig> and in serotype a <dig> strains is located within the chromosome and associated with the arsc operon, which is also the case in the published orfx+ bont/a <dig> strain cdc  <dig>  <cit>  and serotype a <dig> strain nctc  <dig>  <cit> . the bont/a <dig> genes in newly sequenced genomes have putative chromosomal locations and are associated with orfx+ gene clusters and arsc operons, which are common traits for bont/a <dig> genomes  <cit> . this is in contrast to the bivalent strain cdc  <dig> where the bont/a <dig> gene and a bont/b <dig> gene are within a plasmid  <cit> . two argentinian bont/a <dig> strains  and the loch maree strain contain orfx+ bont gene cluster types. the bont/a <dig> gene of the loch maree strain is located within a plasmid while the location of the bont/a <dig> gene of the newly sequenced serotype a <dig> strains is unclear. all of the bont/b genes in newly sequenced and published group i and ii strains are putatively found in ha+ gene clusters. interestingly, while the bont/b <dig> gene in the published okra strain is located on a plasmid  <cit> , the bont/b <dig> gene in newly sequenced strain  <dig> has a putative chromosomal location. in contrast to the plasmid location of the bont/b <dig> gene in strain prevot  <dig>  <cit> , the bont/b <dig> gene in strain  <dig> and strain ibca1– <dig>  <cit>  and bont/b <dig> gene in  <dig> have putative chromosomal locations. the bont/b <dig> genes in the newly sequenced australian strains  have putative plasmid locations, which is consistent with published bont/b <dig> subtypes from japan  <cit> . the bont/f genes of newly sequenced group i strains are found in orfx+ gene clusters, which is consistent with previously published genomes  <cit> . all bont/f <dig> genes in strains analyzed in this study are associated with arsc operons and have chromosomal locations. toxin genes in group i bivalent bont/af strains are associated with orfx+ gene clusters, and the bont/a <dig> and bont/f <dig> genes have putative chromosomal locations. the bont/f <dig> gene of the trivalent strain af <dig> is located within a plasmid  <cit> . bivalent bont/ab,/ba and/bf strains in group i have bont genes putatively located on plasmids. all the bont/e genes in the group ii strains analyzed here are associated with orfx+ gene clusters and rara operons and have putative chromosomal locations.

discussion
diverse members of the clostridia produce potent botulinum neurotoxins that cause botulism, a flaccid paralysis that affects humans, other mammals, birds and fish. these microbes are of interest for public health and biodefense reasons  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer, insertion and recombination events have been documented in bont-producing clostridia , resulting in variation in botulinum neurotoxins, toxin gene clusters and the genomic backgrounds in which the same toxin type or subtype are found. thus, whole genome sequencing of clostridia strains was conducted to provide insight into toxin gene cluster characterisitics, genomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships and global distribution of bont-producing clostridia. genomic sequence data and draft genome assemblies were generated for  <dig> clostridia strains from six continents providing a resource to the research community. these data were compared to publicly available whole genome sequence data using multiple methods. group designation of bont-producing strains was achieved with 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenies and confirmed by phylogenies that included larger swaths of the genome: a phylogeny of concatenated marker genes and a reference-independent, snp-based phylogeny. while the topologies of the three different phylogenies show some variation, the group designations of strains are consistent among all three methods. the concatenated marker genes and reference-independent, snp-based phylogenies demonstrate the diversity within the bont-producing groups i, ii and iii that has been described with other methods  <cit> .

core genome phylogenies of group i and ii strains  illustrate the phylogenetic diversity within each group. homoplasy is distributed throughout the group i and ii core genomes , which suggests a history of recombination and could affect accurate phylogenetic inference. however, the distinct groupings as well as the diversity of group i and ii strains are apparent. clustering of genomes based upon gene content  produces similar groupings of strains as the core genome phylogenies for both groups. anim values reveal the genomic diversity within both groups i and ii indicating that multiple species, subspecies or genomovars are likely present in each group  <cit> . weigand and colleagues  <cit>  recently delineated group i c. botulinum and c. sporogenes strains using similar comparative genomic techniques. the diversity within bont-producing clostridia should be considered when studying these microbes. for example, appropriate strains must be chosen for conducting microbiological challenge tests used for evaluating the risk of bont-producing clostridia or botulinum neurotoxins contaminating food .

the core genome phylogenies of group i and ii strains also illustrate the diversity of genomic backgrounds that express the same toxin type or subtype. examples of different genomic backgrounds containing the same toxin type/subtype are abundant in group i. subtype bont/a <dig> strains are found in multiple clades. argentinian bont/a <dig> strains and bont/a <dig> strain kyoto-f cluster distantly from the mauritius bont/a <dig> strain and two other argentinian bont/a <dig> strains. two rare bont/a <dig> strains from argentina cluster distantly from the bont/a <dig> loch maree strain from scotland. a clade of bivalent bont/af strains is distantly related to a clade of bivalent strains containing bont/a, bont/b and bont/f genes indicating the diversity of genomic backgrounds containing different combinations of these three toxin types. two clades of bont/a <dig> strains are distinguished: one clade with isolates from ecuador, japan and the us and the other clade with isolates from japan. subtype bont/b <dig> and/b <dig> strains in which the bont genes have putative chromosomal locations are not closely related to previously sequenced bont/b <dig> and/b <dig> strains in which the bont genes are located on plasmids  <cit> . this distribution of toxin types and subtypes throughout the group i phylogeny suggests a history of horizontal gene transfer.

this study includes bont-producing strains isolated from both environmental sources and human botulism cases from across the globe; however, whole genome sequence data for strains from many parts of the world are not available. large geographical gaps are evident in much of africa, asia, and south america suggesting much additional diversity is unsampled and unknown. diversity of both genomic backgrounds and toxin type is apparent in some geographic regions for which many genome assemblies are available. for example, argentina is a major reservoir of many serotypes. interestingly, many bont/a <dig> strains were identified in argentina, and examination of the group i core genome phylogeny illustrates the genomic diversity present in this country. while some subtypes have been reported only in certain locales , many subtypes and/or strains that are closely related by core genome comparisons are found in distant locations. for instance, bont/a1-producing strains are found throughout the world, and bont/a <dig> strains showing a close phylogenetic relationship are found in ecuador, japan and the united states. patterns of global serotype and genomic background distribution are not apparent from the analyses presented in this study. understanding the global distribution of bont-producing strains is complex as these clostridia are spore-forming microbes capable of persisting in an environment and can be distributed by a number of dispersal processes. however, a better understanding of the phylogeography of bont-producing strains and of the ability for strain attribution in events such as public health emergencies  may be possible through additional whole genome sequencing efforts .

the comparative genomic techniques used in this study are capable of differentiating bont-producing clostridia  and provide a framework for the study of these toxin-producing microbes . as more whole genome sequence data for bont-producing strains become available our understanding of the diversity and distribution of these microbes has expanded. recent whole genome sequencing of serotype e strains revealed information on stress response  <cit>  and new bont/e toxin variants  <cit> , and whole genome sequencing has identified bont/b <dig> strains in australia that are closely related to bont/b <dig> strains previously reported in japan  <cit> . future research utilizing the growing number of whole genome sequenced strains will further our understanding of these microbes and potentially aid the development of diagnostics and treatments. for instance, comparative genomics may aid in the identification of marker genes capable of identifying strains within groups  more rapidly than methods relying on cultivation and subsequent whole genome sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS
whole genome sequence analyses of clostridia species illustrate the diversity of botulinum-neurotoxin-producing strains and the plasticity of the genomic backgrounds in which bont genes are found. core genome phylogenies are a powerful tool for differentiating bont-producing strains and providing a framework for the study of these bacteria. as more bont-producing strains are whole genome sequenced, our understanding of the genomic diversity of microbes capable of producing potent botulinum neurotoxins will continue to expand.
