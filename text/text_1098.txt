BACKGROUND
agriculture, in struggling to meet global food demands of a rapidly growing population, has been plagued with plant diseases that thwart crop production and account for a global annual average yield loss of  <dig> percent . in light of the importance of agriculture to humans, it is essential to elucidate and understand the mechanisms of plant immunity at the molecular level. as with any host-pathogen conflict, plants and their disease agents are in an evolutionary arms race. when the host mounts a defense reaction, the pathogen develops new strategies to evade the defensive mechanisms, which causes the continuation of this cycle, ad infinitum <cit> . our present understanding of plant immune systems reveals two primary means by which plants recognize their invaders. the recognition of microbial-associated molecular patterns  is the first line of defense and its associated mamps-triggered immunity  is highly efficient at repelling most pathogens. if pathogens are able to breach this first line of defense through the production of effector proteins, plants deploy effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . both modes of defense cause massive transcriptional reprogramming which involves complex signal transduction networks and cross-talk that is mediated by plant hormones, including: salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and ethylene   <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes approximately  <dig>  transcription factors  that are implicated in diverse biological processes including the regulation of immune signaling pathways . however, the global organization of tf-dna interactions remains elusive. moreover, what remains mostly unknown are the precise mechanisms by which the plant cell integrates innumerable synergistic and antagonistic immune transcriptomic signals to orchestrate fine-tuned and pathogen-specific defense responses.

in recent years, systems biology approaches, specifically network analyses that integrate experimentally derived information with computational modeling, have emerged as powerful tools for studying complex traits in diverse species . network biology provides comprehensive analyses of the system’s components  and the relationships among them . in addition, the analyses of the topological properties of the network can provide further understanding of the hierarchical organization of a complex biological system and contribute to the overall interpretation of biological complexity. in any eukaryotic cell, thousands of genes and their products orchestrate their transcriptional and translational activities to ensure the proper execution of cellular functions  <cit> . it has become evident that biological functions can be accomplished by functional modules that are embedded within the interaction networks including transcriptional gene regulatory networks  <cit> . comprehensive high-throughput analyses of gene expression can allow for the identification of gene clusters that are highly correlated in expression levels across multiple samples in any given cellular state  <cit> . generally, it is thought that genes in the same co-expression sub-network are often enriched with similar functional annotations. additionally, the metric to measure the co-expression falls into one of two major categories: correlation coefficients or mutual information measures  <cit> . finally, finding common cis-regulatory elements  can aid in the identification of co-regulated gene clusters and characterization of transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit> .

in the current study we employed a systems biology approach and report the construction of a large-scale arabidopsis immune co-expression regulatory  network. we tested five diverse algorithms, i.e. pcc , aracne multiplicative , aracne additive, clr , and mrnet  with different thresholds, which yielded  <dig> pairs of experimental networks along with their respective random networks . we employed network biology analyses and determined that aracne multiplicative network , with threshold of  <dig>  exhibits properties of a “true” network as it possesses the scale-freeness attribute . next, we partitioned the aicr network and predicted  <dig> functional modules containing at least six members with the largest module encompassing  <dig> nodes. subsequently, we analyzed functional annotations of genes within each module and calculated enrichment of specific gene ontology terms to evaluate the biological significance of functional modules. to establish a causal relationship between co-expression and co-regulation, we sought to identify common cis-regulatory elements. first we developed a new, comprehensive software interface for cis-regulatory elements discovery in arabidopsis . we demonstrated that occean boasts higher capacity  and features higher precision than meme . we identified several statistically enriched novel cis-regulatory elements in our dataset. finally, we evaluated and discussed key immune-related functional modules.

RESULTS
construction of the arabidopsis immune co-expression regulatory  network
to generate a large-scale immune co-expression network, we selected arabidopsis transcriptomic data that encompassed the broadest possible spectrum of immune responses to pathogens or pathogen-mimicking stimuli treatments . previously, we have employed the same set of experiments to define transcriptional responses of genes that encode the proteins identified in plant-pathogen immune network, version 1′   <cit>  . we compiled the lists of probes showing significant up- or down-regulation and discovered  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, which subsequently were used to build a comprehensive immune co-expression network . in a co-expression network, the nodes represent the genes and the edges  represent the similarity/relatedness between the genes, which is generally measured by the pearson correlation coefficient   <cit> . pcc and other measures of association determine the degree of linear dependencies between the variables  <cit> . while these association models have obvious statistical advantages, they lack the ability to capture non-linear relationships  <cit> . in contrast, mutual information  is a non-linear statistic that provides an attractive alternative to measure biologically significant non-linear relationships  <cit> . we used both linear and non-linear models to generate arabidopsis immune co-expression regulatory  network. to measure linear associations between two genes, we calculated the pcc values for all of the genes in a matrix of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  . then, we employed both a similarity threshold algorithm  as well as a newly developed and parameter-free algorithm termed mutual k-nearest neighbor  to process the calculated pcc values  <cit> . mknn was recently shown to possess several advantages over the commonly used similarity threshold algorithm  <cit> . using the linear model, we generated seven pairs of experimental networks along with their respective random networks, i.e., pcc , k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> . to infer non-linear association between immune-related genes, we employed four recently used mi methods: aracne multiplicative , aracne additive, clr , and mrnet  with  <dig>  and  <dig>  thresholds. specifically, we employed the ‘parmigene’ package  to construct eight additional experimental networks . it has been recently shown that the mi estimator implemented in parmigene provides more precision and unbiased results compared with previous mi estimators . our approach to initially build multiple experimental and random networks using both linear and non-linear models is aimed to determine an optimal experimental network that displays topological properties of a “real” biological network  <cit> .table  <dig>

global topological properties of the aicr network
network topology refers to the arrangement or pattern of interactions within a network. the majority of naturally occurring networks, including biological networks, maintain certain topological characteristics in terms of their structure and organization that are significantly different from random networks  <cit> . therefore, in an initial experiment, we computed degree of distribution for all  <dig> pairs of experimental networks along with their respective random networks. we found that two networks, aracne multiplicative  and aracne additive , with threshold of  <dig>  exhibit the scale-freeness attribute , when compared with all random networks and other experimental networks . since the precision of parmigene-based aracne multiplicative is better than aracne additive, we selected aracne multiplicative with threshold  <dig>  as the “true” experimental aicr network  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
degree distribution of the aicr. frequency of the degree of the aicr  and random  networks are indicated in log scale. presence of highly connected nodes  can be observed in the aicr network.



“real-world networks” tend to form high-density clusters and exhibit a clustering coefficient that is significantly higher than expected by random chance  <cit> . therefore, we computed clustering coefficients of the aicr network and its corresponding random network . a clustering coefficient describes the degree of congregation among the nodes of a graph. the distribution of the average clustering coefficient in the aicr ranges between  <dig> - <dig>  and the frequency of the number of neighbors with higher clustering coefficient in the aicr is significantly greater than in a random network . to understand how the differences in the number of connections impact the topology of our co-expression network, we measured the shortest path  and the closeness centrality    <cit> . the path lengths for the majority of the nodes in the aicr are significantly shorter than those of a random network . in addition, the number of neighbors with significantly higher closeness centrality  is higher in the aicr network compared with random network . in biological networks, highly connected nodes  and nodes central to the network  are thought to play significant regulatory roles on their adjacent nodes. thus, we computed several topological properties including shared neighbor distribution  , neighborhood connectivity distribution  , topological coefficients   and betweenness centrality    <cit> . these data suggest that the aicr network is not randomly organized and shares properties of several previously described biological networks . another important characteristic of scale-free networks is the presence of a main component. connected component analyses discovered that the aicr network comprises  <dig> disconnected components, each containing at least six members. the main component in the aicr network has  <dig> nodes and  <dig>  edges. the second largest component contains only  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. this qualitative global topology of the aicr network is similar to previously known biological networks in arabidopsis and other eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, network biology analyses revealed that degree distribution of main component of the aicr follows a power law compared to the main component of a random network with similar size .figure  <dig>

biological implications of topological properties of the aicr network
topological properties of the network can also be utilized to prioritize genes for further functional analysis. highly connected and highly centered nodes are likely to play crucial roles in maintaining network integrity and controlling information flow throughout the plant immune system. specifically, we identified  <dig> highly connected nodes . to characterize the significance of these highly connected proteins, we combined hub <dig> of the aicr with biophysical interactions from plant-pathogen immune network, version 1′   <cit> . the ppin- <dig> was constructed using effectors  from two pathogens, arabidopsis immune proteins, and ~ <dig>  other arabidopsis proteins covering almost one-third of the genome  <cit> . pathogens utilize effector molecules to rewire the host network in a manner conducive to pathogen proliferation and dispersal  <cit> . ppin- <dig> discovered  <dig> effector interacting proteins  and it was also demonstrated that these effector targets are highly interconnected host proteins  <cit> . despite the unavailability of effector targets from the entire arabidopsis genome in ppin- <dig>  we found that the aicr network contains  <dig> effector targets and three proteins  are hub <dig> in the aicr network . given that transcriptional regulation does not necessarily coincide with biophysical interactions, this overlap is potentially significant and biologically meaningful. this also suggests that pathogen effectors target key regulatory proteins in both transcriptional as well as protein-protein interactions networks.

in addition, we selected ninety nodes  with the highest betweeness centrality . among them, we found a number of previously characterized immune regulators or defense-related proteins, encompassing various levels of signal transduction flow: resistance proteins   <cit> , kinases mediating early signaling events   <cit> , transcriptional executors  , secretory proteins assisting with folding and modification of newly synthesized proteins   <cit> , enzymes involved in production of phytohormones and antimicrobial compounds  and pathogenesis-related proteins   <cit> , hormonal response modulators   <cit>  and finally, components of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation   <cit> . identification of these key immune regulators serves as a proof of concept for our analytical approach and justifies further analyses on suite of “top 90” proteins selected among thousands of other proteins in the aicr network.

network clustering and module annotations
another essential feature of a majority of biological networks is their ability to naturally organize into modules  <cit> . discovery of such functional modules within biological networks is imperative for understanding principles of cellular organization and functions. to identify functional modules  that are comprised of highly interconnected sets of genes within the aicr network, we employed a fast agglomerative algorithm   <cit> . this new, low time complexity algorithm operates based on a local variable, edge clustering coefficients, making it ideal to partition a relatively large network  <cit> . overall, we identified  <dig> immune-related functional modules containing at least six members with the largest module encompassing  <dig> nodes . furthermore, we subjected the aicr network to a module size distribution analysis. we computed the frequency and module size and demonstrated that the distribution of the module size follows a power law distribution with an exponential truncation , which is common for several previously described “real-world” networks  <cit> . the module size distribution property further indicates that the aicr network possesses a modular structure.

we also investigated the enrichment of gene ontology  terms  <cit>  in the ten largest immune-related modules  with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> distinct nodes using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>   <cit>  . the go enrichment terms are remarkably informative in examining significant biological functions among co-expressed genes in large-scale networks  <cit> . several gene ontology  categories were enriched  among the genes in the aicr network . these major go categories include: immune-related, plastid, reproductive processes, nucleotide binding/kinases, intrinsic to membrane, metal-binding, mitochondrion and non-membrane-bounded organelle. we utilized these go enrichments in combination with significantly enriched cis-regulatory elements to define the potential functions of the immune-related modules .table  <dig>

development of occean software and identification of cis-regulatory elements
we sought to investigate whether all or a subset of the co-expressed genes within a given immune-related module are also co-regulated . given that transcriptional regulatory networks are highly complex and that functional modules may display crosstalk among themselves, we can also expect that the same transcription factor can regulate co-expressed genes in multiple immune-related modules. whereas experimentally verified plant cis-regulatory elements can be retrieved from place   <cit> , athena   <cit>  and agris   <cit> , only ~ <dig> cis-regulatory elements are currently known in arabidopsis, and a limited set of ~ <dig> immune-related cis-elements have been described. in addition, the prediction of cis-elements from classical approaches is typically driven by a single experiment or dataset. moreover, the currently available online motif discovery software has limited capacity to process a small number of gene entries. for example, frequently used software meme  can only process up to  <dig>  characters in a single run   <cit> . another common software used to predict cis-regulatory elements, athamap  can only manage up to  <dig> gene entries  <cit> . these limitations can substantially decrease the chance of identifying novel cis-regulatory elements. thus, we first aimed to develop occean  software that can process the promoter gene sequences at the entire genome scale  in a single run. occean identifies the statistically enriched/depleted cis-regulatory elements  and integrates data from  our newly developed blastn-based program to identify short sequences and  an improved version of the bootstrapping tool pobo   <cit> . this user-friendly software requires the sequences in fasta format as input, processes genome-scale level sequences, identifies common sequences in a given set of promoters, performs bootstrapping, and provides statistically enriched cis-regulatory elements in the gene’s promoter as the output. occean is freely available online at http://occean.cis.uab.edu:8080/occean/. we employed occean to individually process the sequences of immune-related genes’ promoters for our “top 10” immune-related modules. the promoter sequences of the genome  were used as background to compute the fold enrichments of putative cis-regulatory elements. we also analyzed the occurrences of all the putative cis-regulatory elements , performed  <dig>  × bootstrapping to determine the background mean and finally calculated fold enrichment ratios for all six-mer sequences. three different fold enrichment ratios  prioritized newly identified cis-regulatory elements in “top 10” immune-related modules . to analyze the performance and robustness of our newly developed software, we compared the efficacy of occean with meme. we generated a list of experimentally known cis-regulatory elements and computed the precision of both occean and meme using cis-regulatory elements identified in our top  <dig> immune-related modules. meme was unable to compute the analyses on top  <dig> immune-related modules as it can’t process over  <dig>  characters simultaneously. we computed true positives , false positives  and precision for meme as well as occean enrichment ratios ≥  <dig>  ≥  <dig> and ≥  <dig> . we selected an enrichment ratio ≥  <dig> as the optimal value for occean as it yields a higher number of ntps, significantly fewer nfps positives and greater precisions compared with enrichment ratios ≥  <dig> and ≥  <dig>  in summary, we demonstrated that occean boasts higher capacity  and features higher precision than meme . identification of cis-regulatory elements among co-expressed genes could provide additional information for prediction of biological function.figure  <dig>

performance and accuracy of occean. true positives , false positives  and precision for meme as well as occean with multiple enrichment ratios are shown.



inferring biological relevance of immune-related modules
to fend off potential pathogens, plants employ two major types of immune responses: mamps-triggered immunity  and effector triggered immunity   <cit> . eti is essentially a high amplitude re-booting of the immediate but weaker mti. eti results in robust disease resistance responses, including localized host cell death  and systemic signaling  <cit> . in addition, upon pathogen recognition at the mti and/or eti levels, the plant cell undergoes extensive transcriptional changes involving complex reiterative signaling networks and cross-talk controlled by phytohormones  <cit> . this leads to the metabolic reprogramming and production of an array of antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . here we highlight two major immune-related functional modules, the largest identified module  <dig>  and a more compact module  <dig>  as two most representative gene clusters reflecting the broad array of diverse pathogens and immune stimuli used in the microarray experiments employed in our analyses. module  <dig> is the largest module identified by our clustering analyses and comprises  <dig> nodes,  <dig>  edges, clustering coefficient of  <dig>  and network density of  <dig> . the genes of module  <dig> are enriched in three major go categories:  kinases/ribonucleotide binding,  immune responses/programmed cell death and  transmembrane proteins.figure  <dig> 
inferring molecular functions of the immune-related modules. module  <dig>  and module  <dig>  is presented. module  <dig> is displayed in dark and light green colors. red and green nodes represent up-regulation and down-regulation of genes within these modules by ogs  and flg <dig> . the most over-represented biological process go term was indicated with each module.



diverse kinases account for the major functional category of module  <dig>  encompassing  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins representing receptor-like kinases , mitogen-activated protein kinases , calcium-dependent protein kinases , wall-associated kinases , etc. typically, rlks perceive mamps such as flg <dig>  elf <dig>  chitin and ogs and trigger mti  <cit> . subsequently, a mapk cascade is activated and downstream signaling ensues including phytohormonal crosstalk  <cit> . these events result in the activation of a wide-spectrum of immune responses, such as induced biosynthesis of phytoalexins and other antimicrobial secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates, calcium influx, as well as production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

at the second, more powerful layer of the immune response, plants usually deploy nlr receptors . the nlr receptors directly recognize specific effectors or indirectly detect effector activities and trigger eti  <cit> . we discovered  <dig> nlr genes in the kinase sub-cluster of module  <dig>  these include proteins conferring resistance to diverse pathogens such as pseudomonas syringae, albugo candida, hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and various fusarium races.

the second most abundant go category in module  <dig> was immune-related genes . this functional sub-cluster contains various defense-related transcription factors such as wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  myb <dig> and anac <dig>  <cit> , four members of the ring-h <dig> finger protein family, a heat shock transcription factor hsf a-4a  <cit> , an ethylene-responsive transcription factor erf <dig> and, intriguingly, three scarecrow-like gras family transcription factor genes, known to be primarily implicated in plant root development . collectively, transcription factor genes account for over 40% of this sub-cluster’s gene count. in addition, we identified a small group of genes strongly associated with response to fungal cell wall elicitor chitin, such as two auxin-regulated saur genes, one lectin-like, enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  and senescence-associated protein sag <dig> .

another enriched go category in module  <dig> was membrane-associated proteins including both plasma membrane- and organellar membrane-resident peptides; not surprisingly, the largest class of these membrane proteins is transporters. in plants, uptake and translocation of nutrients play essential roles in physiological processes including plant growth, nutrition, signal transduction, and development . transport processes are also critical for the reallocation of resources and it was previously shown that defense signals cause realignment of transport activities to redirect resources toward immune responses and protect tissues of high value  <cit> . of  <dig> genes assigned to this sub-cluster, seven were transport proteins . the prevailing class was sugar  transporters, in agreement with the fact that this class of proteins constitutes a key component for carbon partitioning at the whole plant level and is involved in both symbiotic and parasitic plant-fungi interactions  <cit> . additionally, we identified cni <dig>  that is a key regulator of the carbon/nitrogen response for growth phase transition in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> , as well as atp binding cassette  and inorganic phosphate transporters that were previously postulated to be required for organ growth, nutrition, development, and stress responses  <cit> . last but not least, we also identified two other well-known immune regulators: syntaxin 121/pen <dig> and mlo <dig> genes, required for resistance against barley powdery mildew, blumeria graminis sp. hordei and a fungal pathogen colletotrichum higginsianum <cit> .

another essential aspect of large-scale transcriptomic analyses is to link co-expression with co-regulation, i.e., to determine presence of common cis-regulatory elements among genes of the same module. several known cis-regulatory elements were discovered in the promoters of module  <dig> genes . two of the enriched elements, tcatgg and catgga, overlap with the octadecameric carg box sequence 5′-cttacctttcatggatta-3′, identified in the apetala <dig> promoter  <cit> . apetala <dig>  a class b homeotic organ identity gene, was originally discovered as the central regulator of petal development in arabidopsis flowers, but later also shown to be involved in control of the floral meristem proliferation, regulation of flowering time, and other plant reproductive processes . inhibition of reproductive processes is an expected outcome of an immune stimulation, given the recent report describing a transition from growth to defense following immune stimuli treatments in arabidopsis  <cit> . involvement of a developmental regulator in defense responses is not unprecedented and was previously shown for a myb-related gene asymmetric leaves  <dig>   <cit> .

jasmonic acid  and ethylene  are two plant hormones antagonistic to sa  <cit>  and down-regulation of major ja/et signaling proteins will promote sa signaling by suppressing the ja/et pathway  <cit> . consistent with this observation, we identified an enriched element, atcttg that resembles the binding site for ethylene-insensitive  <dig>  and three ein3-like  proteins  <cit>  as well as two hexamers gtcgtc and cgtcgt, which overlap with the core binding site of jase <dig> motif in two ja biosynthetic genes opr1/opr <dig> <cit> . recently, ein <dig> and eil <dig> were shown to negatively regulate mamp-triggered immunity via a direct binding and down-regulation of the sa biosynthetic gene sid <dig> <cit> . given that oprs are implicated in ja biosynthesis, we expect a fine-tuned interplay between sa and ja/et signaling pathways  <cit> . in addition, several novel cis-regulatory elements were discovered in our study , and the identity of the cognate transcription factors and their functional relevance will be subject to future studies. very recently, it was demonstrated that numerous transcription factors can recognize secondary elements, which in some cases are completely sequence-unrelated to the primary element  <cit> . in conjunction with this study, our analysis of module  <dig> shows that arr <dig>  not only recognizes the known primary cis-regulatory element agata/tcg but also can specifically bind to a previously unknown cis-regulatory element agatct. thus, it’s likely that transcription factor have extended list of binding specificities beyond the currently known cis-regulatory elements. we propose that the above described transcription factors and additional unknown regulatory proteins coordinate the gene regulation in this module.

our data provide further insights into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms repressing additional putative negative regulators of plant defense upon treatments with pathogen-mimicking stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used a systems-level network biology approach to construct genome-wide arabidopsis immune co-expression network and demonstrated that this network shares properties of a ‘real-world network’. topological properties-based partitioning allowed us to unravel  <dig> distinct immune-related functional modules. we demonstrated that nodes in the same module are not only highly correlated at the expression level but also densely connected to each other. detailed analyses of two key immune-related modules provided a systems-level understanding of how plant cells coordinate distinct immune signals to orchestrate fine-tuned and pathogen-specific defense responses. our novel approach to discover cis-regulatory elements using occean is an effective method of solving the issue of finding novel motifs within a sequence set. occean has advantages over other programs of the same purpose, such as apples  and meme  <cit> . apples requires finding organisms of a specified relational distance for comparison, which can burden the user, and meme has the statistical risk of discarding actual existing motifs. these problems are avoided in our solution whilst continuing to maintain a fair amount of focus on client-side simplicity. in addition, occean has the capacity to be expanded for analyses of other eukaryotes genomes, such as fly and human. our systems-level approach to examine cis-regulatory elements  in the promoters of the co-expressed genes made it possible to link co-expression to co-regulation of genes in the same module.
