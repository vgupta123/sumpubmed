BACKGROUND
inteins are small proteins naturally found either embedded within a larger precursor protein , or split between two pro-proteins . they have the unique ability to self-catalyze their excision from the pro-protein and in the process form a peptide bond between the flanking amino acid sequences that reside at the n-and c-terminal boundaries with the intein  <cit> . these flanking regions adjacent to the intein are referred to as exteins, analogous to the terminology for introns and exons. an intein acts autonomously, splicing together the exteins without the need of a co-factor or an assisting complex. since splicing is post-translational, for cis-acting inteins a single open reading frame driven by a single promoter expresses two distinct mature protein products: the spliced exteins and the intein.

the first intein described, sce vma <dig>  was found in a subunit of the vacuolar h+-adenosine triphosphatase complex of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . currently over  <dig> inteins are known, found in over  <dig> species of microorganisms in over  <dig> different proteins  <cit> . present in all three phylogenetic domains of life, inteins in eukaryotes are predominantly found in fungi and unicellular alga  <cit> .

a homing endonuclease is often present within cis-acting inteins. the splicing and endonuclease domains are structurally and functionally distinct, as shown both by the crystal structure of sce vma <dig>  <cit>  and the conservation of splicing following the deletion of the homing endonuclease  <cit> . in addition minimal or mini-inteins lacking the homing endonuclease occur naturally or have been engineered to be as small as  <dig> amino acids  <cit> .

the use of inteins in molecular biology, biotechnology and drug discovery has recently been reviewed  <cit> 
. the broad spectrum of applications for inteins is in part due to the minimal constraints placed on the sequence of the exteins. the only absolute requirement is the presence of cysteine, serine or threonine at the downstream splice junction in the c-terminal extein. there are no known size constraints. splicing efficiency is reduced if the extein domains are unfolded or have poor solubility, but in vitro even this can usually be overcome with detergents or refolding regimes  <cit> . the immediate flanking sequence of the intein can affect splicing efficiency to varying degrees  <cit> , but a variety of sequences are tolerated. thus the inherent tolerance of inteins allows them to be adapted to splice proteins of diverse character.

in this study the flexibility of inteins has been exploited to investigate the potential for inteins to direct in vivo gene modification, specifically the tagging of an internal region of a protein with gfp. the microscopy group of the yeast resource center is focused on using förster resonance energy transfer, fret, to study the organization of large protein complexes in vivo  <cit> . a limiting step for fret studies is identifying regions within proteins that can accept a gfp-related fluorescent protein tag. as a first step towards overcoming this limitation, we engineered genetic markers within the pch prp <dig> intein that provided a way to internally tag proteins in one step in yeast. the pch prp <dig> intein was chosen for its robust, temperature-independent splicing activity  <cit>  and the engineered inteins continued to display very high splicing efficiency.

RESULTS
pch prp <dig> intein splices with inserts at the empty endonuclease site
during the course of their initial characterization of the pch prp <dig> mini-intein elleuche et al.  <cit>  aligned the sequence of the intein with prp <dig> inteins from other species. the position of a presumptive lost homing endonuclease was identified from a gap in the alignment. this position, designated "e", later was shown to tolerate a deletion of six amino acids without loss of splicing activity  <cit> . in addition the intein could be split in half at this position and the resulting two independent proteins, when expressed in e. coli, had active trans-splicing activity  <cit> .

given the tolerance of the "e" position for change, this site in the pch prp <dig> intein was chosen for the insertion of genes encoding genetically selectable enzymes. these enzymes were: 1) aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; 2) imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase from s. pombe; and 3) hygromycin b phosphotransferase. they confer g418/kanamycin resistance, histidine prototrophy and hygromycin resistance in the appropriate yeast genetic background, respectively. in addition the gene encoding the transcriptional activator lexa-vp <dig>  <cit>  was inserted. these proteins share in common a modest size  all below the typical size of homing endonucleases . perhaps more importantly the n-and c-terminal ends of each protein are proximal to each other  <cit> . a schematic diagram of these constructs is shown in figure  <dig> 

we used the experimental system of elleuche et al.  <cit>  to test whether the pch prp <dig> intein with inserted markers could splice. in their system gst is the n-terminal extein and a  <dig> × his-tag is the c-terminal extein. the embedded intein is expressed in e. coli and splicing results in the production of gst- <dig> × his and the released intein.

we confirmed the robust splicing activity of pch prp <dig> intein . gst- <dig> × his and the released intein are clearly visible in sds-page, and the identity of spliced gst- <dig> × his was confirmed by western blot analysis with anti- <dig> × his and anti-gst antibodies. the addition of cloning sites flanked by flexible protein linkers at position e did not impair splicing since the free inteins and the gst- <dig> × his were clearly visible in sds-page with no evidence of unspliced products .

the modified inteins with the  <dig> different selection marker cassettes also showed highly efficient splicing . based on the ratio of spliced products to larger, unspliced proteins in the western blots, the splicing efficiencies ranged from ~88% for the pch prp <dig> hygr-intein to almost 100% for the his5-and lexa-vp16-inteins. thus the pch prp <dig> intein tolerated the insertion of four different proteins at the vacant endonuclease site, maintaining nearly complete excision and splicing activity in this system.

the marked pch prp <dig> inteins splice in yeast and confer selectable genetic traits
to determine whether the modified inteins would function in yeast we constructed a new panel of yeast cen4/ura <dig> plasmids that contained the marked inteins expressed under the control of the gal <dig> promoter. for these plasmids the n-terminal extein was gfp containing a nuclear localization signal  and the c-terminal extein was the flag peptide, dykddddk. just as in the previous e. coli plasmids, the extein/intein junction encodes five n-and four c-terminal extein residues of the p. chrysogenum prp <dig> protein. the spliced product is nls-gfp-flag  and the released intein carries the selectable genetic marker or a transcription factor. nls-gfp provided a simple way to follow expression and proper folding of the extein.

in agreement with the results in e. coli, all of the modified inteins when expressed in yeast displayed high efficiency splicing . based on the limits of detection in the anti-gfp westerns, we estimate that the efficiency of splicing is greater than 96% for the modified inteins.

concomitant with splicing the intein is released from the precursor protein. the inteins did not inhibit growth and provided resistance to g <dig> or hygromycin in cells expressing the pch prp <dig> g418r-intein or the hygbr-intein, respectively . likewise the pch prp <dig> his5-intein was able to complement the mutation in his <dig> in this genetic background . finally the pch prp <dig> lexa-vp16-intein was able to drive expression of a leu <dig> gene that had  <dig> lexa operator sequences within its promoter and confer selectable leucine prototrophy to the yeast strain. thus in all cases each marker remained functional within the context of the excised intein.

direct integration of the marked inteins at the cmd <dig> locus
having established that the intein remained active and the embedded markers functional in yeast, we next examined whether the marked inteins could provide a method to introduce gfp within the coding sequence of a targeted gene. for our test we chose cmd <dig>  the gene encoding yeast calmodulin  <cit> . calmodulin contains two globular ef-hand calcium-binding domains separated by a flexible linker. the design of the experiment is presented in figure  <dig>  briefly the gfp-pch prp <dig> marker-intein cassette was pcr amplified using oligonucleotide primers with ends homologous to the center of the cmd <dig> gene encoding the central linker region. transformation and direct selection for the markers within the inteins isolates cells in which the pch prp <dig> gfp-intein cassettes were inserted by homologous recombination between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> of calmodulin.

transformation with dna from the pch prp <dig> g418r-, his5-and hygbr-inteins produced transformants with the selected auxotrophic or antibiotic resistance, while the pch prp <dig> lexa-vp16-intein did not yield transformants. since the level of expression of the intein is dependent on the level of cmd <dig> expression we conclude that the lexa-vp <dig> was not at a level to fully activate lexaop6-leu <dig> gene expression in strain yl  <cit> lu. however in agreement with the previous results from yeast episomal expression, the recovery of resistant or prototrophic cells from the other pch prp <dig> marked-inteins again showed that the intein domain did not impair the activity of the selection markers.

in our experimental design the intein was initially transformed into a diploid strain so that transformants could be recovered even if the integration of the intein impaired the expression or activity of calmodulin. diploid transformants were sporulated and the tetrads dissected to yield four haploids, two with the intein insertion and two without. the results of the tetrad analysis are shown in figure 5a. the pch prp <dig> his5-intein cmd <dig> insertions grew at the same rate as wild-type, but both the pch prp <dig> g418r-and hygbr-inteins impaired growth.

associated with the impaired growth was evidence of inefficient splicing . the pch prp <dig> his5-intein was effectively spliced from calmodulin, producing cmd1-gfp at high efficiency . on the other hand, the g418r-intein  and hygbr-intein  were not. different isolates showed varying levels of accumulation of unspliced product . the slow growth and phenotypic variation of the g418r and hygr isolates precluded further analysis and in any case meant that these inteins were not suitable for tagging cmd <dig> 

calmodulin concentrates at sites of cell growth and at the spindle pole body in yeast  <cit> . the wild-type localization pattern was seen for cmd <dig> with the internal gfp-his5-intein . in agreement with the published results, unbudded cells had calmodulin in puncta at the cell membrane. in newly budded cells calmodulin formed a patch at the bud tip that dispersed as the bud grew. preceding cytokinesis calmodulin was concentrated at the bud neck. localization at the pair of spindle pole bodies is best seen in the medium budded cell in figure  <dig>  for comparison the online yeast resource center public image repository  <cit>  contains over  <dig> images of yeast showing the localization of cmd <dig> tagged with different fluorescent proteins.

discussion
inteins are widely used in biotechnology to manipulate proteins. the capacity of inteins to break and form peptide bonds has been exploited to develop a range of methodologies from a routine procedure to purify proteins, to more advanced semi-synthetic applications that assemble proteins for nmr, crystallography and mechanistic studies. these uses and others have been recently reviewed  <cit> .

the use of inteins as genetic tools is still an emerging area of research. temperature-sensitive inteins  <cit> , light-activated inteins  <cit> , and inteins controlled by small molecules  <cit> , provide a way to control protein activity by controlling when a protein that has been interrupted by an intein is spliced together to yield its mature form. conditional protein assembly by inteins in vivo is a promising method to generate temperature-sensitive mutants, and target when and where a protein is functional in a cell.

here we add a new role for inteins in genetic manipulations, as a genetic marker with the unique property of self-excision. the engineered intein marks the expression of the protein into which it is embedded and yet after splicing is not a part of the mature protein. we demonstrate in yeast the use of a pch prp <dig> his5-marked intein to deliver, in one step and in vivo, gfp within a targeted protein without disturbing the function of the protein. in principle, the method could be extended to other protein tags, and adapted to other organisms.

we created a family of genetically marked inteins based on the prp <dig> intein of penicillium chrysogenum. prp <dig> inteins have an ancient heritage and are widespread  <cit> . however they are not found in s. cerevisiae. the pch prp <dig> intein and the native yeast vma <dig> intein are sufficiently divergent  to preclude homologous recombination between the two during the transformation step. for comparison the s. cerevisiae his <dig> and the s. pombe his5+ genes share 58% sequence identity and yet do not recombine during integrative transformation  <cit> . the sequence divergence, the fact that the pch prp <dig> intein is well characterized  <cit> , splices at high efficiency across a broad range of temperatures  <cit>  and lacks a dna binding domain led to its choice in our studies.

the primary sequence of the pch prp <dig> mini-intein shares sequence similarity with other inteins  <cit> . thus its three-dimensional structure likely conforms to the canonical hedgehog/intein  protein scaffold  <cit> . the hint module has a flat horseshoe shape with a series of β-strands forming the framework. the active-site is centered at the interior base or "toe" of the horseshoe. endonucleases if present in the intein are a separate domain located away from the active site region at the "heel" of the horseshoe.

here we show that the pch prp  <dig> intein, and presumably other inteins, have a remarkable capacity to accept foreign protein domains at the region of the structure where the homing endonuclease resides in full inteins. high splicing efficiency was observed for all of the inserted single domain proteins that were used for genetic markers. we attribute the success to several factors. an alignment of the pch prp <dig> intein with the synechocystis sp. dnab and the mycobacterium xenopi gyra inteins shows that the insertion site for our genetic markers is located in disordered loops in the crystal structures of both of these inteins  <cit> . thus the region of insertion is inherently flexible and unstructured. in addition, one shared feature of the proteins used for markers is that their n-and c-termini are proximal  <cit> . the exit of the inserted protein domain out of the intein and its return occurs nearby in space and would tend to minimize strain in the structure of the intein. since the majority of single domain proteins have some region of their two termini within  <dig> Å  <cit>  and termini are consistently found at the surface of the protein  <cit> , we predict that many single domain proteins could be inserted into inteins without detriment to splicing efficiency.

three enzymes and a transcription factor were used as genetic markers to modify the pch prp <dig> intein. in pilot experiments all four modified inteins showed high splicing efficiency, both in e. coli and yeast, and in yeast the proteins within the excised inteins were active and enabled growth under conditions of selection. however when these inteins were used to deliver gfp within calmodulin only the strain tagged with the pch prp <dig> his5-intein grew normally. under selective conditions transformation with the pch prp <dig> lexa-vp16-intein did not yield any transformants, and the g418r-and hygr-inteins yielded cells with poor growth and diminished splicing efficiency. the disruption of calmodulin function was surprising, given the pilot results, and is not understood. it is possible that the unspliced products which accumulate interfere with growth. we are actively investigating ways to boost the level of stable protein and the efficiency of splicing through changes in codon usage and the composition of the linkers between the various domains. in addition, given the success of the pch prp <dig> his5-intein, we are constructing other inteins with metabolic markers that may require lower levels of expression.

our intein based method to insert the gene encoding gfp within an orf offers several advantages over other pcr-based methods available in yeast. other methods  <cit>  introduce a gene with its own promoter that must be first be removed before the gfp is correctly in frame. thus a second recombination event is required, either catalyzed by the induction of cre-recombinase or by a rare natural recombination event that is isolated by genetic selection, to remove the genetic marker with its associated promoter. in addition the cre-recombinase based system leaves behind within the orf a peptide sequence coded for by the remaining loxp site, a sequence that can disrupt activity . the introduced gene also temporarily interrupts the expression of the target protein. with the intein-based method integration and tagging occur in one step. since the marked inteins are inserted in frame, expression of the target is only disrupted during recombination. given these advantages marked inteins show great promise and complement other available methods.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the pch prp <dig> intein can incorporate a variety of selectable genetic markers and still exhibit high splicing activity. this led to the development of a simple method to insert gfp within the interior of a protein in yeast. this novel use of an intein has the potential to provide a way to add, substitute, or delete domains within targeted proteins in a single step in yeast. in addition it may find application in other systems as well, such as recombineering, a method that is also based on genetic manipulation through recombination.

refinement of this method is underway at the yeast resource center. primary areas to investigate will be the effect of codon optimization, the utility of other selection markers, and cassette development for other useful tags such as the fret partners yfp and cfp.
