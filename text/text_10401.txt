BACKGROUND
protein structures are classically described using secondary structures: α-helices, β-strands and loops, also called coils. this third class is a default description, which denotes all residues that are not involved in periodic local structures, helices or strands. on average, protein loops encompass 50% of residues. protein loops are often involved in protein functions  <cit> . they participate in active sites of enzymes  <cit>  and in molecular recognition  <cit> . they are often the place of binding sites: for example, the atp and gtp-binding site  and the calcium-binding site  are found in loops  <cit> . the description and analysis of protein loops have been the subject of many studies. protein loops were first seen as random because they are highly variable in terms of sequence and structure and are subject to frequent insertions and deletions  <cit> . because of their large variability, loops are the protein regions which are the most difficult to analyze and modelize. indeed, in protein models, loops, and more particularly long loops, are the place of a lot of errors.

systematic studies actually showed that loops, even long ones, are far from random. in their study, panchenko et al.  analyzed the evolution of protein loops and identified a linear correlation between sequence similarity and average loop structural similarity in protein families  <cit> . they suggested that the evolution of loops is made via an insertion/deletion process and concluded that even longer loop regions cannot be defined as "irregular conformations" or "random coils".

the resolution of an increasing number of protein structures allowed the classification of short loops  according to their geometry, and gave birth to several loop classification systems: sloop  <cit> , wloop <cit> , archdb <cit> , li et al. classification  <cit> . these different classification initiatives were based on different criteria such as loop length  <cit> , flanking region type  <cit> , flanking-region geometry  <cit> , or loop conformation  <cit> . the majority of the resulting loop clusters presented a significant sequence signature. these classifications thus revealed the existence of recurrent loop conformations with amino-acid dependence. however, these classifications focus on short and medium loops  and do not take long loops into consideration.

another type of studies focused on specific structural motifs extracted from loops such as β-turn  <cit> , β-hairpin  <cit> , helix-turn-helix  <cit> , helix-turn-strand  <cit> , or ω-loop  <cit> . the most frequent motif is β-turn. it corresponds to 25% of residues  <cit> . other turn types have been identified such as γ-turn  <cit>  or α-turns  <cit> . recently, golovin et al.  proposed a web application that allows identifying known small structural motifs characterized by hydrogen-bonds  from a query protein  <cit> . a database of these structural motifs extracted from a set of  <dig> representative proteins is now available  <cit> . all these studies were dedicated to particular -and known- small structural motifs, but did not perform a systematic analysis of all loops.

in a previous study, we have shown that the structural alphabet hmm-sa  is an effective tool to simplify loop structures with good accuracy  <cit> . structural alphabets constitute a privileged tool to discretize 3d structures including loop regions, with an accuracy that depends on the size of the fragment library  <cit> . hmm-sa is a collection of  <dig> structural prototypes of four residues called structural letters, permitting the simplification of all three-dimensional  protein structures into uni-dimensional  sequences of structural letters  <cit> .

here, we present an extensive analysis and description of both short and long loops based on the analysis of structural motifs extracted from loops. the systematic extraction of seven-residue structural motifs is based on the loop decomposition in structural letters provided by hmm-sa. thanks to this decomposition, structural motifs are described as patterns of structural letters, called structural words. this representation as structural words permits to partition the full space of loop conformations, independently of their length, in clusters represented by distinct words. we first present general results concerning structural words: repartition of clusters and intrinsic characteristics of structural words such as structural variability and sequential specificity. then, we present the analysis of the link between structural words and loop types. in order to gain further insight into the high complexity of loop structures, we complement our analysis with an original approach based on statistical exceptionality implemented in the spatt software  <cit> . the idea is to compute, for each structural motif, a score that is a measure of its "unusualness" with respect to some background model. the goal is to assess whether some structural motifs are more or less frequent than expected. this is directly inspired by analogous studies of sequence patterns in genomes  <cit> , that permitted the discovery of functional patterns such as restriction sites  <cit> , cross-over hot spot instigator sites  <cit>  and polyadenylation signals  <cit> . finally, this systematic structural-alphabet decomposition and word analysis provide an accurate description of loops and allows extracting meaningful motifs in both short and long loops, which is an important contribution to the difficult task of long loop analysis.

RESULTS
we extracted all structural motifs within loops from a non-redundant data set of  <dig> protein chains, using the structural alphabet hmm-sa. this alphabet is a collection of  <dig> prototypes of four residues, denoted , based on a hidden markov model  <cit> . it permits the encoding of a protein structure of n residues into a sequence of  structural letters.

loop structures extracted from our protein data set were encoded into structural-letter sequence using hmm-sa. each encoded loop was then decomposed into overlapping structural words, i.e. series of k consecutive structural letters, corresponding to k -  <dig> residue fragments. thus, structural words can be seen as a way of clustering the fragments. each cluster of fragments is defined by a structural word. the first step of this work is the determination of the optimal length of fragments/words.

choice of the structural word length
the choice of the optimal length was guided by the following dilemma. on the one hand, it is desirable to consider long fragments, in order to better describe 3d conformation and capture the longest-range interactions. on the other hand, the amount of available data rapidly becomes insufficient when dealing with long fragments. to choose this optimal length, we computed the frequency of all structural words in our data set, with length from five residues  to ten residues , see additional file  <dig>  we identified seven residues as the maximum length to avoid the problem of data sparsity. the number of different structural words sharply increases beyond that limit and 80% of structural words of  <dig> residues are seen at most  <dig> times in our data set, versus  <dig> times for words of  <dig> residues. for these reasons, we selected seven residues, i.e., four structural letters as the most meaningful length for systematic extraction.

first part: global results on structural words
we systematically extracted structural words of four structural-letters from protein loops and analyzed their properties: structural variability, amino-acid specificity and preference for particular loop types.

extraction of structural words from loops
the data set contained  <dig> loops of minimal length seven residues . from these loops, we extracted  <dig> overlapping seven-residue fragments. the  <dig> fragments were partitioned into  <dig> different four-structural-letter words, with an average cluster size of  <dig>  and a high variability: standard deviation was equal to  <dig>  as hmm-sa offers a very detailed description of loop structures, some slightly different conformations ended up in distinct clusters; our classification then disclosed with a high number  of singletons, i.e. clusters containing only one fragment. however, even if we had considered x-ray structures with good resolution , such rare conformations might have been an artifact due to the structural flexibility of some protein regions. indeed, protein loops are generally more flexible than regular secondary structures  <cit> . we tested this hypothesis using b-factors, as atoms with high b-factors are those with the largest positional uncertainty. we computed the average cα b-factor for all fragments in each structural word. we used the rule-of-thumb suggested in  <cit>  and set a b-factor cut-off at  <dig>  we found that a large proportion  of singletons have an average b-factor greater than  <dig>  compared to only 1% for structural words from clusters with more than  <dig> fragments. singletons and rare conformations are thus linked to structural flexibility. in the rest of the paper, we consider a restricted set containing words seen more than  <dig> times , denoted wset≥ <dig>  the reason for this choice is that our goal is to perform a statistical analysis of word properties, namely structural variability and sequence specificity. since these properties are assessed by rmsd and z-scores extracted from sequence profiles, a sufficient number of fragments per cluster is needed. we estimated that  <dig> fragments were sufficient to compute mean rmsd and sequence profiles. statistics of wset≥ <dig> are given in table  <dig>  as can be seen in table  <dig>  wset≥ <dig> encompass  <dig> different structural words , and 60% of fragments.

1: words seen more than  <dig> times. 2: under-represented words, 3: non-significant words, 4: over-represented words, '*': significantly higher occurrence according to a kruskal-wallis test. coverage rates are given on a per structural letter basis. numbers within brackets denote the percentage of words/fragments with respect to the  <dig> words/ <dig> fragments of the whole data set  and with respect to the  <dig> words/ <dig> fragments in wset≥ <dig> .

loop coverage by wset≥ <dig> words
in this part, we check if the elimination of rare words does not result in  a dramatic diminution of loop coverage or  a loss of diversity in structural families.

at first, we can observe that the selection of wset≥ <dig> words does not favor any loop length: the distribution of loop lengths in wset≥ <dig> is similar to the global loop-length distribution .

global loop coverage
. words from wset≥ <dig> encompass 60% of the fragments. however, since we extracted overlapping fragments, the coverage rate of loop structures is more than 60%: if a loop of  <dig> structural letters is described by two wset≥ <dig> words on positions  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  the actual coverage is 100% even if only  <dig> out the  <dig> overlapping fragments are represented by frequent words.

coverage rates are reported in table  <dig>  the limited number of words seen more than  <dig> times  covers most loop, namely 73% of loop lengths. if we make the distinction between short loops  and long loops , we can see that wset≥ <dig> words cover both short and long loops. if we now consider loops that contain at least one wset≥ <dig> word, wset≥ <dig> words partially describe 85% of all loops -80% of short loops and 98% of long loops.

the consideration of the restricted set wset≥ <dig> thus allowed us to get rid of clusters with high positional uncertainty while still covering a large fraction of protein loops.

scop superfamily coverage by wset≥ <dig> words
there might be a risk that the selection of recurrent words could give preferences to loops from highly populated structural families. in order to address this problem, we assessed the coverage of wset≥ <dig> with respect to the scop classification. we surveyed the scop classification of  <dig> protein chains covered by wset≥ <dig>  the results are presented in table  <dig>  we identified  <dig> different superfamilies in the full data set. the removal of rare words led to the elimination of  <dig> protein chains, and  <dig> scop superfamilies. we then checked the number of structure members in the  <dig> remaining superfamilies. after the removal of words seen less than  <dig> times, this number was lowered for  <dig> superfamilies. the majority of affected superfamilies  lost only one member, as shown in additional file  <dig>  these elements suggest that the elimination of words seen less than  <dig> times still permits to keep a good representation of scop superfamilies, since 97% of initial superfamilies were unaffected. therefore, loops from highly populated structural families are not given preferences due to the selection of recurrent words.

consequently, we can conclude that the systematic extraction of structural words shows that most loops can be described by a limited number of frequent four-structural-letter words.

structural and amino-acid conservation of words
the next step consists in analyzing the intrinsic structural and sequential properties of structural wset≥ <dig> words. we considered the following properties: structural variability of the fragments, and dependence to their amino-acid sequence.

structural properties of words
the intra-word structural variability of clusters is assessed using the average root mean square deviation  between fragments within the same cluster. the global mean rmsdw is equal to  <dig>  Å . words exhibiting the largest structural variability include structural letters j or f. it was expected because these two letters are the most structurally variable ones  <cit> . we can observe that the word structural variability could be quantify by the structural-letter type. this allows avoiding the computation of rmsd and the superimposition of word fragments. this analysis shows that most words exhibit a weak structural variability.

the upper part of the table corresponds to the analysis of word structural properties. the intra-word structural variability is analysed using the root mean square deviation  between fragments corresponding to the same word . the inter-word structural variability is analysed using the rmsd between fragments of two different words . the lower part of the table corresponds to the analysis of sequential properties of words. the intra-word amino-acid preferences of a word are analysed using zmax criterion  and the number of significant position of a word . the coverage of sequential space is analysed using the euclidian distance between z-score vectors  . numbers within brackets indicate standard deviations. *: significant differences according to the kruskal-wallis test. the rmsddev are computed on a subset of  <dig> words of wset≥ <dig>  a: words shared by long and short loops.

amino-acid preferences of words
intra-word amino-acid specificity is assessed using z-score computation as described in material and methods. briefly, we computed z-scores for the  <dig> amino acids at the  <dig> positions of a structural word. we then considered the maximum z-score, denoted zmax, measuring the strongest amino-acid specificity, and the number of significant positions, denoted nbpos*, indicating how many positions exhibit significant sequence specificity. as shown in table  <dig>  the global average zmax  is equal to  <dig>  . almost every word  present at least one significant position  and 19% of words have at least one very significant position . conversely, only 3% of words  have no informative position. among the sequence-informative words,  <dig> words  are highly informative, as all their positions are significant. these very informative words cover 16% of loops. words with high zmax contain structural letters d and s, in agreement with the fact that these two letters have very strong sequence specificity  <cit> . thus we can conclude that most loops are composed of motifs with amino-acid specificities.

correlation between structural variability and sequential specificity
we can note that there is no obvious link between zmax and rmsdw . the structurally less variable words are not systematically the most informative ones in terms of amino acids. some words with high rmsdw are informative in terms of sequence, as illustrated by word ffff, with an rmsdw equal to  <dig>  Å and zmax equal to  <dig>  .

 <dig> words are characterized by both low structural variability and significant sequential specificity, with rmsdw lower than  <dig> Å and zmax greater than  <dig>  these structural words cover 63% of loop regions. we can conclude that most loops are composed of motifs with a weak variability and amino-acid specificities.

relation between structural words and loop type
after exploring the intrinsic structural and sequential properties of structural words, we analyzed their relationship with different loop types seen in proteins. we defined different loop-types according to their lengths and flanking secondary-structures  <cit> .

loop length
we used the kullback-leibler asymmetric divergence, denoted kld criterion  <cit>   to extract the words that are significantly more frequent in long loops than expected. these words are classified as specific to long loops. words specific to short loops are extracted in a similar manner. the result of this analysis is presented in table  <dig>  we found that  <dig> words  are specific to long loops and  <dig> words  are specific to short loops. it means that roughly one third of the structural words display a significant preference for a length range, and two thirds are unspecific, i.e., shared by short and long loops. in table  <dig>  we also reported the loop coverage achieved by words specific to short and long loops. it can be seen that half of loops are covered by words shared by long and short loops. about one third of short loops  are covered by words specific to short  loops.

1: words shared by long and short loops 2: description by the four possible flanking-types , 3: description by the four flanking-types and the two length ranges . 4: all-loop coverage rate  5: short-loop coverage rate  6: long-loop coverage rate  7: number of words

flanking regions
we now consider the four possible flanking regions for a loop: ββ : loops linking two β-strands, αβ: loops linking an α-helix and a β-strand, αα : loops linking two α-helices and βα: loops linking a β-strand and an α-helix. we found that about 60% of wset≥ <dig> display a significant preference for one of the four-flanking-region types. this word set permits to cover about 59% of loops. thus, about half of the loops are described by flanking-region-specific words.

loop length × flanking regions
we then combine the loop length and loop type descriptors to distinguish eight types of loops. according to the kld criterion,  <dig> words  exhibit a significant preference for one of the eight loop-types. this significant word set covers more than half of the loops .

the association between words and the eight loop types is further explored using a correspondence analysis presented in figure  <dig>  the first two axes of the correspondence analysis capture 62% of the variability and are mainly explained by the preference for short loops. the ββ short loops is opposite to the αα short loops on the first axis  while the αβ short loop is opposite to the βα short loop on the second axis . association is weaker for long loops -appearing in the central region of the plot- but similar tendencies are observed for short and long loops. this analysis made it possible to identify the loop structures with a dependence to loop-type, and the ones with no dependence.

loop-type preferences × intrinsic properties
by combining the loop-type preferences of words and their intrinsic properties, we observe that words specific to short loops present slightly higher sequence dependence than others, while words specific to long loops have lower structural variability .

the upper part of the table corresponds to the analysis of word structural properties. the intra-word structural variability is analysed using the root mean square deviation  between fragments corresponding to the same word . the inter-word structural variability is analysed using the rmsd between fragments of two different words . the lower part of the table corresponds to the analysis of sequential properties of words. the intra-word amino-acid preferences of a word are analysed using zmax criterion  and the number of significant position of a word . numbers within brackets indicate standard deviations. *: significant differences according to the kruskal-wallis test. the rmsddev are computed on a subset of  <dig> words of wset≥ <dig>  a: words sharing by long and short loops

we can note that only  <dig> words  have neither amino-acid-significant position, nor loop-type preference. thus, less than 1% of loop regions are covered by these unspecific words in terms of sequence dependence and loop types.

our approach, which relies on a systematic decomposition of short and long loops, allowed showing loops are composed of recurrent structural motifs, some of them with preference for a particular loop type in terms of loop length and/or flanking regions. conversely, some structural words have no preference for a loop length, meaning that they are similarly found in short and long loops.

second part: statistical exceptionality of structural words
in the second part of this study, we complement our analysis of word properties by their statistical exceptionality in protein structures represented by strings of structural letters. statistical exceptionality is traditionally used in genome analysis to extract functional motifs such as enzyme restriction sites or regulatory motifs  <cit> . our goal was to explore if a statistical bias is also associated to specific properties in the case of protein structures. statistical exceptionality does not measure the frequency of a word. it is an indicator of the discrepancy between observed and expected occurrence according to a background model that takes into account the first order markovian process between structural letters. the statistical representation of words was assessed using the spatt software that computes an exceptionality score lp for each word . according to the value of lp, words are classified as over-represented, under-represented or not significant. hereafter, over-represented words are referred to orw, under-represented words as urw and not significant words as nsw.

extraction of exceptional words
the analysis of the correlation between the frequencies  and lp values for all words in the data set shows that many frequent words tend to be over-represented but there is no linear relation between frequency and exceptionality . some frequent words are classified as urw or nsw, like ffff . conversely, some rare words are classified as orw, like gdzi . an illustration of the geometry of these words is presented in figure  <dig>  this result shows the relevance of the extraction of word exceptionality instead of word frequency.

the repartition of words in wset≥ <dig> according to exceptionality status is given in table  <dig>  we can see that orw contribute predominantly to the set of fragments in wset≥30: 40% of the fragments are in orw clusters. orw clusters are indeed significantly bigger than other word types .

redundancy of loops and robustness of the extraction method
in this study, loops were extracted from a non-redundant data set presenting less than 50% sequence identity. different redundancy levels have been used in the literature. concerning loop classifications, wloop <cit>  used a protein data bank with 50% sequence identity. the loop classification system archdb is available in two versions: one built on a set of proteins with 40% sequence identity and the second on a redundant-protein set with 95% sequence identity  <cit> . it is classically considered that the evolutionary relationship between two proteins is detectable up to 25% sequence identity. consequently this cut-off is frequently used for calibrating prediction methods  <cit> . since loops are more variable than the rest of the protein sequence, we set the identity cut-off at 50% in order to work with as many data as possible with limited redundancy.

one could object that no attention was given to how many redundant loops were left or removed from the database during the redundancy filtering. the problem of loop redundancy is a non-trivial one: the extraction of loops from a non-redundant protein set does not necessarily result in a non-redundant loop set, and loop redundancy is itself difficult to quantify. we indirectly addressed this question by repeating our systematic extraction on different data sets, using identity levels of 25% and 80%. it was also important to ensure that our observations were applicable to protein structures in general and not only to the data set used. taking into account the correction due to the different database sizes , we found a satisfactory level of consensus equal to 82% between the 25% and 50% databases, and 90% between the 50% and the 80% databases . these ratios refer to the proportion of recurrent words - common to both data sets - that are classified in the same statistical word type . moreover, only one word, qlhb, was assigned as over-represented in a data set and under-represented in the other. therefore, we can conclude that the extraction of exceptional words is robust and very weakly depends on the redundancy of the data set. then, we compared the properties of the wset≥ <dig> words after classification into these three classes.

exceptionality and word properties
the structural and amino-acid property measures for the three statistical word types  are reported in table  <dig> 

the intra-word structural variability is lower for orw than for other words, as assessed by a kruskal-wallis test  <cit>  . the rmsdw distribution for the three statistical word types is shown in figure 3a. it can be seen that the rmsdw distribution of orw is shifted toward lower values. orw are thus significantly less structurally variable than other words.

the coverage of the structural space by the structural words of different exceptionality status is assessed by the rmsd between clusters. the goal is to evaluate how well the structural words sample the conformational space of loops. in order to assess the coverage of the loop-conformational space, we computed the rmsd between all pairs of words in the wset≥ <dig>  denoted rmsddev. the average rmsddev computed for each type of words is given in table  <dig>  the average rmsddev for words in wset≥ <dig> is equal to  <dig>  Å it is significantly greater than the average rmsdw, indicating that the structural variability of words is low compared to the structural differences between words. this observation stands for the three types of words. rmsddev were computed between every words of wset≥ <dig>  and the resulting  <dig> ×  <dig> dissimilarity matrix is used to compute sammon's map projections shown in figure 3b. it can be seen that the three statistical word types all sample the conformational space in the same way. it means that orw correctly sample the wset≥ <dig> conformational space and are not restricted to some particular shapes. let us note that rmsd are dissimilarity measures that do not necessarily respect the triangular inequality. a consequence is that the sammon's projection does not actually reflect the word's proximity . however, since the three point series are simultaneously projected on the same subspace, sammon's maps can be used to qualitatively assess the similarity between the conformational sampling. we can thus conclude that orw are, on average, significantly more structurally stable than other words, and sample all the conformational space.

intra-word amino-acid specificity is significantly higher for orw . the zmax distributions for the three statistical word types are shown in figure 4a. the distribution for orw is clearly shifted toward high values of zmax. orw are also more informative in terms of number of significant positions . these results must be interpreted with caution due to the restrictive condition for the interpretation of the z-scores . however, they show that orw are, on average, more informative in terms of both the number of significant positions and specificity.

the coverage of sequence space by the different structural words is assessed using a procedure similar to the one used for structural space. we computed the euclidean distances between z-score vectors of each word pair in wset≥ <dig>  the resulting average distances are given in table  <dig>  the kruskal-wallis test indicates that, in terms of amino-acid specificity, orw are significantly more distant one from the other . sammon's map projections of the three word-types are shown in figure 4b. we can see that orw cover a large region of the map, including regions not visited by nsw and urw. we can conclude that orw are globally more distinct from each other in terms of amino-acid sequence dependence than other words and that they sample the sequence space better than other word types.

exceptionality and loop types
as shown in table  <dig>  orw significantly contribute to the description of long loops: orw cover about 40% of both short and long loops. moreover, 58% of the loops contain at least one orw, and as many as 80% of long loops contain at least one orw. if we consider the specificity of words for a particular loop length  it can be seen that  <dig> orw are specific to long loops and  <dig> orw are specific to short loops. it means that  <dig> orw out of  <dig>  i.e. 53% of orw, exhibit a significant preference for a loop-length type. this proportion should be compared to what is obtained for other words: 31% of nsw and 28% of urw are significantly dependent on a particular loop length range. if we consider the flanking secondary-xstructures, the same observation can be made: 70% of orw versus 52% of nsw and 45% of urw are specific to a particular loop type. it thus seems that orw exhibit stronger dependence toward the loop type than other statistical word-types.

finally, we compared the preference of the three word-types for the eight loop-types defined by length range and flanking secondary-structures. we found that 88% of orw versus 72% of nsw and 75% of urw exhibit a significant dependence for a particular loop type. the qualitative analysis by correspondence analysis is displayed in figure  <dig>  where the three statistical word types are highlighted in different colors. it can be seen that orw predominantly appear in outlying regions of the plot, in agreement with the kld quantification.

therefore, we can conclude that orw present higher signature in terms of structure and/or sequence and higher dependence to loop types than other words. at the same time, orw correctly sample all the loop-conformational space, and better cover the sequential space of protein loops. they are seen in every loop type and offer a reasonable coverage rate, with only  <dig> different structural motifs.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have developed an original approach for the analysis and the description of loop structures. this approach corresponds to a systematic extraction and statistical analysis of seven-residue structural motifs within loops, using a structural-alphabet simplification. contrary to classic approaches, our method does not require either loop-structural alignment or computation of structural parameters. the structural word approach defines a structure-based clustering of all fragments, where all seven-residue fragments encoded in a similar word can be seen as a cluster. our systematic clustering resulted in  <dig> clusters, with  <dig> to  <dig> fragments per cluster, and an average size equal to  <dig>  the analysis of b-factors showed that some of the singletons are indeed associated to regions with high b-factors, which is indicative of coordinate uncertainty. it was thus legitimate to exclude them from the analysis.

in order to compute cluster properties, we chose to restrict ourselves to the  <dig> clusters  with more than  <dig> fragments, referred to wset≥ <dig>  this reduction was required to have a sufficient number of fragments to compute rmsd and sequence profiles for clusters. this limited number of structural words  results in a good coverage rate of the loops: 73% of loop-lengths. we additionally checked that the restriction to wset≥ <dig> does not result in the restriction to highly populated structural families, and that our results are stable on different data sets.

comparison with existing approaches
an extensive comparison with already existing loop classification schemes is extremely difficult because we do not consider the same objects, and pursue different objectives. existing classifications cluster loops according to their length  <cit> , flanking region types  <cit> , flanking region geometry  <cit>  and loop geometry  <cit> . such classifications consider full length loops and are thus inherently limited to short loops. in the present study, we cluster fixed-length structural motifs within loops, independently of their lengths or flanking regions, thus also bringing information for long loops. consequently, it is delicate to compare our loop analysis with existing loop classifications.

other studies have previously investigated the use of seven-residue fragments to analyze protein structures  <cit>  whereas our study focuses on loop structural fragments. for this reason, the results are not directly comparable.

other studies consisted in identifying functional patterns in whole proteins  <cit> . such patterns, involved in protein function, are relatively rare. on the contrary, our approach considers recurrent structural motifs in loops. alternatively, some groups have investigated the identification of 3d structural patterns linked to functions that are not necessarily made of consequent residues  <cit> . for example, ausiello et al.   <cit>  extracted some structural motifs from protein in different folds which recognize ligands presenting same features. in this case also, the studied objects are very different, making the comparison difficult. another interesting analysis, megamotifbase, deals with structural motifs that are important for the preservation of the 3d structure in given families or superfamilies  <cit> . these motifs were identified using both sequence conservation and preservation of important structural features. they mainly correspond to regular secondary structures, whereas we focused our analysis on loops. for all these reasons, any comparison between our approach and already existing classifications should be regarded with caution.

insight into loop structures
we analyzed structural and amino-acid properties of clusters, defined by structural words, using rmsd and different criteria to measure their amino-acid dependencies. we found an average intra-cluster rmsdw equal to  <dig>  Å versus  <dig>  Å for the inter-cluster rmsddev, which confirms our previous results  <cit> . in the loop classification archdb <cit>  clusters grouping seven-residue loops present an average rmsd close to  <dig> Å. in sander et al.  <cit> , fragments were clustered according both to their structure and amino-acid sequence into  <dig> clusters with an average rmsd of  <dig> Å. the most populated cluster groups α-helix fragments and probably largely contribute to the average rmsd.

loop description by recurrent structural words permits a quantification of the loop structural redundancy: around 73% of loops are described by a limited number of accurate recurrent structural words. thanks to the loop-structure simplification using hmm-sa, our method is the first one allowing a systematic mining of loops independently of their lengths and the study of all loops in terms of motif composition.

first, we demonstrate that the majority of the recurrent structural words have low structural variability and specific sequence signature. the simplification of loop structures using hmm-sa permits to analyze long loops. we can observe that 46% of loops are covered by words found both in short and long loops. these results show that short and long loops are composed of similar motifs. this is in agreement with the insertion/deletion process of loop evolution hypothesis made in  <cit> . in addition to the identification of the shared structures, our analysis provides a quantification of how the same structural words are re-used in different loops. the existence of words found in both long and short loops could allow transposing some short-loop results into the long-loop analysis and decreasing the long-loop-analysis complexity.

we observe that only one third of short  loops are covered by words that are specific to short  loops. moreover, words specific to short loops have higher amino-acid specificities than other words. that means that these short loop regions  are more informative in terms of sequence than other regions. interestingly, words that are specific to long loops are structurally less variable than others meaning that a part of long loops  are structurally well defined.

we also analyze the dependence between recurrent words and the loop flanking-regions. we show that around 60% of words exhibit a significant preference. most of these words are specific to βα and ββ loops. these results are in agreement with classification of short loops based on flanking region information as  <cit>  and provide an identification and quantification of the structures with a dependence on the flanking regions. moreover, this study allows identifying and quantifying regions with no preference for flanking-region types. indeed, 31% of loops are covered by words with no preference for a flanking-region type.

the amino-acid specificities of structural words were also assessed. we observed that 97% of recurrent words, covering 70% of loops, have amino-acid specificities. different studies have analyzed the amino-acid preferences of loops, particularly for short loops. kwasigroch et al.  have shown that amino-acid preferences were more frequent in the core of short loops  <cit> . other studies have focused on the amino-acid preferences of β-turns and shown that these amino-acid preferences occurred at end positions  <cit> . this study provides an identification of regions with amino-acid specificities and a new quantification of the amino-acid specificity: we found an average number of three positions with significant amino-acid preference for wset≥ <dig> motifs.

perspective in terms of loop-structure prediction
most recurrent motifs exhibit significant amino-acid specificities: half of them display significant level of amino-acid conservation in at least four significant-positions. if we consider words with at least four significant-positions as predictable, we extract  <dig> words covering 60% of the loops . it is clear that this predictability index  is very basic and too optimistic. the predictability index of a word has to combine both its sequence informativity and sequence specificity. indeed, one word can have several positions with high amino-acid preferences but close sequence from other words. conversely, words with few informative positions can be clearly distinguishable from others in terms of sequence. moreover, several words can be compatible with a same seven-residue sequence, involving several candidates per amino-acid sequence. a possible strategy for loop prediction would consist in splitting the query sequence into overlapping seven-residue fragments, and identifying subset of structural words compatible in terms of sequence profile with each fragment.

the successions of compatible overlapping word candidates would then be selected using a hidden markov model taking into account the favorable transitions between structural words. this would result in a 1d structural letter trajectory set compatible with the target loop sequence. then, the 3d reconstruction from this set of 1d trajectories could be achieved using an energy function as in pepfold  <cit> . this approach could yield a set of 3d structural conformation candidates for the target loop, in agreement with the flexibility of loops. finally, for long loop prediction, a confidence index could be proposed for different parts of the predicted loop. indeed, for a given loop, prediction of some regions could result in a limited number of word candidates while for other regions, the prediction could result in a large number of word candidates. this approach could be a way to decrease the complexity of long-loop prediction.

illustrative example of loop analysis
in figure  <dig>  we present an illustration of a long loop of  <dig> structural letters extracted from the protein structure with pdb code 3sil, encompassing residues  <dig> to  <dig>  using the word extraction protocol, this loop was decomposed into  <dig> words of  <dig> structural letters. among these  <dig> words, four words -namely uogi, khbb, iffr and rpbq- belong to wset≥ <dig>  these four words are seen in both short and long loops in the data set, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  structural word khbb is over-represented, with an lp value equal to  <dig> . it is characterized by a low structural variability  and strong amino-acid preference , with conservation of hydrophobic amino acid at position  <dig> and proline at position  <dig>  these amino-acid conservation trends are derived from the analysis of every occurrence of a particular fragment.

in this particular protein, a lysine and a threonine occupy positions  <dig> and  <dig> of word khbb. this region does not appear to be particularly conserved in the multiple alignment of homologous sequences retrieved from a blast search in swiss-prot . when aligned with sequences retrieved from a blast search in pdb sequences, this region exhibits three positions with equivalent residues . we attempted to further explore the functional implication of this long loop. 3sil is a sialidase from salmonella typhimurium. it corresponds to swiss-prot entry nanh_salty, and is responsible for the cleavage of terminal sialic acid from glycoproteins. there is no functional annotation in swiss-prot for the 120- <dig> region, but the catalytic and substrate-binding sites are annotated. they are highlighted in pink and blue in figure  <dig>  furthermore, a structure of sialidase co-crystallized with an inhibitor is available in the pdb: structure 1dil, with sequence identical to 3sil. the inhibitor is thus shown in red in figure  <dig>  it can be seen that loop 120- <dig> is spatially close to functional residues and inhibitor molecules. this observation suggests that this loop could be important for the substrate stabilization, but only the observation of the enzyme co-crystallized with a substrate could confirm this hypothesis.

this example shows that some motifs extracted from loops seem to be involved in protein function. it is not surprising due to the fact loops are often involved in protein function.

perspective of functional-motif identification
in genomic sequences, functional motifs are often characterized by particular frequencies . therefore, the search for functional motifs is successfully guided by the search for exceptional motifs  <cit> . inspired by this singularity, we explored the properties of structural words in proteins to see if the over- or under-representation of particular conformations can be linked to particular features. contrary to classic methods that were primarily developed for dna sequences, statistics are here computed by a method that takes into account the large number and short length of sequences of our data set  <cit> . we considered the intrinsic properties of structural words and their relationship with the statistical exceptionality status of words, classified as over-represented, under-represented, or not significant. the comparison of the three statistical word types showed that over-represented words have indeed specific properties: they are highly conserved in terms of structure or sequence and highly dependent on loop types. by setting a rmsdw cut-off equal to  <dig>  Å and a z-max cut-off equal to  <dig>  we found that 89% of over-represented words present either a low rmsd or a high zmax or a significant dependence to a loop type defined by eight types according to the kld criterion. this ratio is only 62% for other words. this indicates that statistical exceptionality results from a complex process combining word frequency, sequence and/or structure properties. the consideration of statistical exceptionality thus enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in protein loops. most of the time, the relationship between local structures and protein function is not straightforward. our findings open new perspectives to the use of over-representation in order to detect functional motifs in loops. it is the subject of an ongoing study  where we suppose that functional motifs could correspond to over-represented motifs in a protein family.
