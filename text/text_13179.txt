BACKGROUND
within the last  <dig> years, several bacteria of the genus bartonella were recognized as zoonotic agents in humans and isolated from various mammalian reservoirs. pets represent a large reservoir for human infection, including exotic pets, because most bartonella spp. infecting them are zoonotic. cats are the main reservoir for bartonella henselae, b. clarridgeiae, and b. koehlerae. dogs can be infected with b. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, b. henselae, b. clarridgeiae, b. washoensis, b. elizabethae, and b. quintana  <cit> . members of the genus bartonella have historically been connected with human diseases, such as cat-scratch disease, trench fever, and carrion's disease, and recently, have also been recognized as emerging pathogens causing other clinical manifestations in humans  <cit> . it has been shown that bartonella spp. alone may cause 3% of all cases of infectious endocarditis. endocarditis is a life-threatening disease, for which a favourable rapid etiological diagnosis must be made as early as possible  <cit> . trench fever, a louse-borne disease caused by bartonella quintana, was reportedly reemerging recently in homeless persons  <cit> . identification of the many species is based either on isolation of the bacterium or pcr testing; nine bartonella species or subspecies have been recognized as zoonotic agents, including b. henselae, b. elizabethae, b. grahamii, b. vinsonii subsp. arupensis, b. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, b. grahamii, b. washoensis and more recently b. koehlerae and b. alsatica  <cit> . serotyping provides valuable information on the incidence of some bacterial serotypes, such as salmonella, pneumococcus, and haemophilus, for which typing can be performed by the slide agglutination method, multiplexed latex beads or pcr  <cit> . various microarray methods have been described for dna, rna and protein analysis than can be applied in the diagnosis of infectious diseases  <cit> . these microarray systems allow several tests to be performed simultaneously without separating the original sample  <cit> . in recent years, monoclonal antibodies have become common tools, which can be used for serological assays to detect drugs, hormones and serum proteins; for diagnosis of viral and bacterial diseases; for tumour identification; and for purification of antibodies, proteins and cells  <cit> . our goal was to develop a multiple antigenic microarray able to detect and identify by serology each of the bartonella strains.

to test the bacterial microarray, we studied a collection of polyclonal antibodies directed against the bartonella strains. we initially produced mouse polyclonal sera against twenty-nine bartonella strains and determined optimal dilutions using an array using bartonella.

furthermore, to confirm the usefulness of our system for serotyping, we produced a new array containing four bartonella strains responsible for major human diseases, using some bacterial strains as blind test controls and bartonella strains isolated by blood culturing from homeless people during a visit of shelters in marseilles.

finally, we used our protein microarray for screening monoclonal antibodies generated against the gro el protein of b. clarridgeiae.

RESULTS
production of polyclonal sera
we obtained a polyclonal serum against each strain used in the present study. all sera exhibited titers ranging from 1:  <dig>  to 1:  <dig>  against their respective immune strain . therefore, we decided to test two dilutions for each polyclonal serum: 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  and in case of a strong cross-reaction, 1:  <dig>  and 1: <dig>  on slides with spotted array.

immunofluorescence assay on  <dig> bartonella strains array
for all analysis, spots corresponding to s. aureus protein a and mouse igg exhibited a strong value, indicating a good distribution of mouse serum sample and fitc conjugated antibodies. spots of bsa and igg goat amca showed very low values, demonstrating a slight background noise level of the assay. initially, five sera from unimmunised mice were tested and we obtained mean values less than  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> auv, respectively, corresponding to the 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  and 1: <dig>  dilution assays . we obtained a polyclonal sera specific for each of the strains in this study, however, the level of cross reactivity with other species varied greatly. antibodies to b. alsatica and b. birtlesii showed strong and clear signals with very low levels of cross reactivity. b. henselae marseille and b. henselae houston generated polyclonal antibodies with a distinct microarray profile. for b. henselae marseille, b. taylori, b. birtlesii, b. bacilliformis, b. alsatica, b. quintana oklahoma, b. henselae houston, b. tribocorum, b. koehlerae, b. schoenbuchensis, b. doshiae, b. vinsoni arupensis, b. clarridgeiae, b. bovis, bartonella strains isolated from macropus giganteus and from uromys caudimaculatus polyclonal sera, we obtained a strong signal directed against the strain that was used for immunisation at the 1:  <dig> and 1:  <dig>  dilutions. the values ranged from  <dig>  auv for b. henselae marseille to  <dig>  auv for b. tribocorum at the 1:  <dig> dilution. in the case of the 1:  <dig>  dilution assay, values ranged from  <dig>  auv for b. henselae marseille to  <dig>  auv for b. taylori . among these polyclonal sera, some exhibited a low level of cross reactivity . for twelve other polyclonal sera, the 1:  <dig>  and 1:  <dig>  dilutions were investigated due to the absence of a clear and strong specific signal and excessive cross-reaction at the 1:  <dig> dilution. the recorded values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  auv and from  <dig> to  <dig>  auv at two dilutions 1:  <dig>  and 1:  <dig>  for b. phoceensis and for the strain isolated from isoodon macrouris, respectively. we concluded from this experiment that polyclonal sera against b. quintana oklahoma, b. henselae houston, b. henselae marseille and b. clarridgeiae at the 1:  <dig>  dilution can be used to perform serotyping.

bacterial strains from homeless persons and array for serotyping
a total of  <dig> positive cultures accounting for  <dig> % of the assays were detected from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after seeding blood culture medium on columbia agar. signals on the array were negative or very slight against the five blind test strains, but very strong against reference strains with the corresponding polyclonal serum. all the bacterial strains isolated by blood culturing from homeless persons gave a strong positive signal using polyclonal sera at the dilution indicated above. however, these signals were weaker than that of the b. quintana strain and we obtained comparable results with a b. quintana monoclonal antibody produce .

production of monoclonal antibodies
in this study, we obtained a total of  <dig> hybridomas, of which  <dig> gave a positive signal on the indirect immunofluorescence assay. the investigated microarrays exhibited a negative signal against b. birtlesii for all the tested monoclonal antibodies. nine monoclonal antibodies strongly reacted with all the other strains, whereas three monoclonal antibodies did not react against one of the strains, b. bacilliformis. five monoclonal antibodies demonstrated a major affinity toward b. clarridgeiae but did not react against the other strains, especially b. bacilliformis, b. henselae houston, b. henselae marseille and b. quintana .

the monoclonal antibody p8g <dig>  showed the best values to detect all bartonella, except b. birtlesii. detection values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> auv showed a low background noise for the four negative controls, whereas the detection values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> auv showed good detection for  <dig> strains. the nine monoclonal antibodies reacted differently the same strain, and there was no correlation between the values and the phylogeny of bartonella species based on groel sequences   <cit> .

discussion
the tools of choice for strain identification of bartonella spp. are molecular tests, ever since the advent of multilocus sequence typing  <cit> . in fact, it is difficult to determine the bartonella species that cause disease using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies for classical immunofluorescence, because of extensive cross-reactivity and the removal of all detectable antibodies by cross-adsorption  <cit> .

in the present work, we used an immunofluorescence assay in combination with microarray technology and automatic methods against twenty-nine different bartonella strains at the same time. this serotyping technology for all strains simultaneously permit us to decrease cross reactivity and allows us to detect and identify each strain using polyclonal antibodies. our method has also permitted the detection of new strains, such as bartonella strains isolated from macropus giganteus and from uromys caudimaculatus using polyclonal antibodies. our immunofluorescence-array assay exhibited sensitivity comparable to a classical single immunofluorescence assay, as we obtained a significant signal up to a 1: <dig>  dilution against respective strains used for immunization. for some strains, specific signals were associated with cross-reactions. however, the intensity easily allowed the correct identification of the strain, except for b. rattimassiliensis polyclonal serum, which reacted with b. tribocorum as well. however, we easily discriminated between the strains, as the b. tribocorum polyclonal serum did not react significantly with b. rattimassiliensis. these signals were delivered without a previous cross-adsorption and without separate analysis. during the immunoassay, some problems may occur, such as a hook effect  <cit> , due to the variation in the amount of spotted antigen that cannot be easily detected even by using different test controls. however, the problem can be avoided by testing several dilutions. polyclonal serum can be unsuccessful due to possible variations in antigen recognition, selection of antibody secreting clones by the immune system control, or mutations that occur during the immune response  <cit> . the two bartonella strains, b. rattimassiliensis and b. tribocorum, were isolated from rodents. phylogenetic studies based on its, 16s rdna, genes of four intracellular proteins and the groel gene, have indicated close clusters for these two bartonella strains, but also for all b. vinsoni subsp, for b. phoceensis and b. alsatica, and for b. doshiae and b. taylorii  <cit> . our newly designed technique was successful in discriminating among all the strains in the last three clusters stated above, as well as strains responsible for human bartonella diseases.

using the second array, we identified known strains from homeless persons, such as b. quintana, confirming that urban trench fever is endemic in the homeless population. we demonstrated that  <dig> hour is sufficient to test four samples, suggesting that our new serological approach could be a practical tool for serotyping of isolated strains using specific polyclonal antisera and reference bacteria.

we have also screened monoclonal antibodies produced against b. claridgeae, in order to find a monoclonal antibody that broadly reacts with the bartonella species. the best result was obtained with the monoclonal antibodies against groel. microarray revealed three categories, corresponding to preserved or variable epitopes of the groel protein in the genus bartonella. this monoclonal antibody failed to react with b. birtlesii and the study has been repeated four times with the same negative results. however, polyclonal antibodies against b. birtlesii showed a good reactivity, excluding the defaults in the spotted antigen. the sequence alignments of seven strains of groel proteins  <cit> , showed that a single mutation at position  <dig>  is specific to b. birtlesii. this mutation could explain the lack of reaction to b. birtlesii by the monoclonal antibodies and the important role of this amino acid in the conformation and recognition by the monoclonal antibody. new serological investigations with large-scale use of bacteria from the same species or the combined genus of the pathogens could be of interest in human health for the diagnosis of bartonella diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that microarray of spotted bacteria can be a practical tool for serotyping of unidentified strains or species  by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. this could be used in research and for identification of bacterial strains.
