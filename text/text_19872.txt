BACKGROUND
epidemiological studies have reported an inverse association between asthma and the intake of vitamin a. dietary vitamin-a intake and serum vitamin-a concentrations are significantly lower in patients with asthma than in healthy control subjects or in people with severe asthma than in those with mild asthma  <cit> . all-trans retinoic acid  is a biologically active metabolite of vitamin a with profound effects on t-cell activation  <cit> , differentiation  <cit> , and function  <cit> . atra binds to retinoic acid receptors in the nucleus leading to the activation of transcription of many target genes  <cit> . emerging evidence demonstrates that atra signaling is critical for t cells differentiation and function. atra is an early mediator in the development of cd4+ t cell-mediated immunity, and also plays a pivotal role in optimal effector and effector memory cd8+ t cell differentiation in which vitamin a supplementation is used to augment effector responses  <cit> . meanwhile, atra promotes foxp3+ regulatory t-cell  differentiation and sustains the stability and function of natural tregs in an inflammatory milieu. in addition, it suppresses th <dig> differentiation. atra and rapamycin can synergistically increase tgf-β-mediated foxp <dig> induction in antigen-specific th <dig> memory cells when effector cytokines are neutralized. these foxp3+ t cells converted from th <dig> memory cells possess treg activity and can ameliorate th <dig> memory-mediated airway hyperreactivity and eosinophilic inflammation  <cit> . moreover, atra suppresses th2-related chemokine expression in vitro by down-regulating the expression of interleukin - <dig> receptor and inhibiting eosinophil and basophil differentiation  <cit> . in addition to modulating t cells, atra plays an important role in the maintenance of the normal epithelial mucociliary phenotype  <cit> . however, the role of atra on airway inflammation after allergenic challenge has not been established. the goal of this study is to determine whether atra alters th <dig> response to modulate the severity of airway inflammation in an ovalbumin -induced allergic airway inflammation animal model.

RESULTS
administration of atra attenuated lung inflammation
clinical studies have shown that dietary vitamin a intake and serum vitamin a concentrations are significantly lower in patients with asthma than in healthy control subjects, implicating that vitamin a might be an attractive candidate for asthma treatment. atra is a biologically active metabolite of vitamin a  <cit> . to determine the effects of atra on allergic airway inflammation, an ova-sensitized murine airway inflammation model was used. the atra group received an intraperitoneal  injection of 400 μg/mouse of atra. the vehicle group was injected by corn oil . all treatments were administrated prior to ova sensitization. a control group of mice without ova sensitization was injected with pbs. mice were sacrificed and lung inflammation was evaluated at 24 hours after the final challenge . as shown in figure  <dig>  ova treatment in the vehicle group induced a substantially increase of total cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  as compared with the control group , while a significant decrease was observed after atra intervention . observation by light-microscopy confirmed that ova priming and activation led to a marked peribronchial leukocyte, especially eosinophilic infiltration. more importantly, the inflammatory response was significantly attenuated after treatment with atra . these data indicated that atra treatment mitigated the inflammatory responses in the antigen-induced allergic process.

administration of atra decreased the levels of th <dig> and th17-related cytokines, and down-regulated the expression of corresponding transcription factors in the lung
to determine the effects of atra on th cells and the cytokines produced by these cells after allergen stimulation in the lung, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> levels in the lung homogenates were assessed by elisa. the levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the vehicle group were significantly elevated compared with those in the control group . atra pretreatment significantly reduced the il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels and slightly decreased the il-17a level, but there was no significant difference on the levels of ifn-γ or il- <dig> in the compared groups . meanwhile, real-time pcr results showed that mrna levels of il- <dig> and il-17a in the lung were consistent with the elisa results. furthermore, the mrna levels of gata- <dig> and rorγt were significantly decreased in the atra group compared with the vehicle group , while the expression of the ifn-γ and th1-related transcription factor t-bet was much higher in the atra group than in the vehicle group. in contrast with the previous in vitro results, atra moderately increased the il- <dig> mrna level and had no effect on the expression of the treg-related transcription factor foxp <dig> in the lung .

administration of atra suppressed the levels of th <dig> and th17-related cytokines in draining lymph nodes
to further determine the suppressive effect of atra in airway inflammation, we examined th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> responses in draining lymph node cells on day  <dig>  lymphocytes were isolated from mediastinal lymph nodes and stimulated with ova323– <dig> peptide for 72 hours. the percentages of il- <dig> and ifn-γ positive cd <dig> t cells were analyzed by facs. the results showed that the number of il-4-positive t cells significantly increased in the vehicle group compared with the control group. atra pretreatment decreased the percentages of il-4-positive t cells compared with the mice treated with vehicle alone. however, there was no significant difference in the percentages of ifn-γ-positive cd <dig> t cells between the vehicle and the atra group . to analyze the effects of atra on cd <dig> t-cell function, supernatants from lymphocytes stimulated with ova323- <dig> peptide were analyzed with elisa. compared with the control mice, the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-17a were significantly increased in the vehicle mice, however, these cytokines were dramatically decreased after pretreatment with atra . there was no significant difference in ifn-γ and il- <dig> among the three groups .

in-vivo atra treatment inhibited ag-specific th <dig> responses with no obvious effect on foxp3+ treg population in the spleen
furthermore, in addition to draining lymph nodes, splenic th-cell populations were examined for the effects of atra treatment. splenocytes were stimulated with ova323– <dig> peptide for 72 hours and then intracellularly stained with anti-il- <dig> and ifn-γ antibodies. the percentages of il- <dig> and ifn-γ in gated cd <dig> t cells in the spleen were analyzed by facs. the results showed that the percentages of il-4-positive t cells were significantly increased in the vehicle group compared with the control group, while the percentages of ifn-γ positive cd <dig> t cells were slightly decreased in the vehicle and the atra treated groups compared with the control group . to examine whether atra treatment could increase the foxp3+ treg population in vivo, splenocytes were stained for foxp <dig> and cd <dig> and analyzed by facs. unlike the effect of atra on conventional foxp3- cd <dig> t cells, atra treatment did not increase the foxp3+ treg population in the spleen of immunized mice. these results showed that atra pretreatment decreased the percentage of il-4-positive t cells without obvious effects on the treg population in the spleen .

retinoic acid does not obviously affect th <dig> differentiation in vitro
to explore whether in-vivo-reduced th <dig> cytokines following atra treatment was directly influenced by atra, we assessed the effect of atra on th <dig> differentiation in vitro. naïve cd4+cd62l+ t cells from do <dig>  mice were cultured under a th2-skewing condition without or with different concentrations of atra. after the cells were cultured for 5 days, il- <dig> expression was determined by intracellular staining. similar percentages of il-4-producing cells were detected in cd <dig> t cells with or without atra treatment , suggesting that atra might not influence th <dig> differentiation in vitro.

discussion
previous reports showed that atra is the biological active metabolite of vitamin a and has an important immunomodulatory effect by inhibiting th <dig> polarization and enhancing foxp <dig> expression  <cit> . by using a murine th2-mediated airway inflammation model, we demonstrated that the administration of atra attenuated ova-induced airway inflammation by decreasing th <dig> and th <dig> related cytokines and inflammatory cells in the airway and atra mediated reduction of th <dig> cytokines was via inhibiting gata- <dig> expression. our findings provide further supports for the anti-inflammatory role of atra in the treatment of lung diseases.

ova-induced allergic asthma is recognized as a pathological condition that results from chronic airway inflammation characteristically associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and neutrophils into the bronchial lumen. an aberrant th2-type response to allergens is characterized by the overproduction of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  which are critical for the maintenance of ongoing ige-mediated eosinophilic inflammation  <cit> . accumulating evidence has suggested that aberrant il- <dig> production is a key determinant of severe forms of asthma. il-17a induces lung-structural cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines  and chemokines , thereby triggering neutrophil infiltration  <cit> .

we showed that the administration of atra inhibited ova mediated secretion of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the lung, draining lymph nodes, and the spleen. consistent with the decreased levels of th2-related cytokines, the recruitment of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, was markedly decreased in the balf and the lung after atra administration. these results indicated that atra may alleviate airway inflammation by reducing th <dig> cytokines. meanwhile, t-bet and gata- <dig> are responsible for the regulation of the cytokine genes during th1/th <dig> differentiation. gata- <dig> has been shown to promote the expression of several th <dig> cytokines, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  <cit> . it is well known that overexpression of gata- <dig> predisposes for th2-mediated diseases such as allergic asthma and suppression of gata- <dig> expression in the lung reduces il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> productions concurrently  <cit> . compared with the vehicle group, the gata- <dig> mrna level in the lung in the atra treated group was significantly decreased, which may partially explain the reduction of il- <dig> and il- <dig> production in these mice. in addition, a recent study performed in chronic asthma model showed that prolonged atra treatment tends to inhibit th <dig> cell infiltration and neutrophilia without obvious alteration of th <dig> cell numbers  <cit> . the different observations are probably due to different th-dominate asthma models used between the two studies, in which the immune responses are mediated by different th subsets.

the concentration of retinoic acid is likely to be critical to its effect on the airway responses. previous studies have demonstrated that atra reverses the airway hyperresponsiveness  and exogenous administration of retinoic acid is capable of attenuating the asthma phenotype  <cit> . however, it has also been reported that atra promotes th <dig> development to exacerbate allergic immune and inflammatory responses during systemic sensitization  <cit> . the differences in the responses of the airway are probably linked to the different concentrations and time point used in those studies. indeed, the study performed by mateu et al. supports the above notion. they have found that retinoic acid directly enhances allergic responses in vivo, but higher doses effectively decrease ahr by inhibiting il- <dig> production  <cit> . therefore, the concentration and time point of retinoic acid should be carefully considered in the applications.

of note, atra was not able to affect th <dig> differentiation in a th <dig> skewing condition in vitro. the discrepancy between the effects of atra on in-vitro and in-vivo th <dig> responses suggested that atra might not intrinsically control th <dig> differentiation. rather, it might do so by inhibiting the th <dig> response or by modulating the function of antigen presenting cells. in addition, bidad k et al. have reported that atra can significantly decrease th <dig> cells in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. the effect of atra in such patients serves as an immunomodulator on deviated immune cells, which is associated with decreased inflammatory cytokine tnf-α secretion  <cit> . in our study, we also found that the level of il-17a was slightly decreased in the draining lymph nodes and lung, while ifn-γ and t-bet mrnas were slightly increased in the lung after the administration of atra. unlike the in-vitro results previously reported by elias et al.  <cit> , our in vivo data showed that atra moderately increased il- <dig> expression without affecting il- <dig> production, foxp <dig> expression and treg numbers in the lung or spleen. the different responses of treg cells might be attributed to the difference between the in-vivo environment and in-vitro condition  <cit> . additionally, atra effects on treg cells in vivo might be also influenced by the exposure time of atra. for example, zhao et al. found that the proportion of foxp3+ cd <dig> treg cells in the lymph nodes is temporarily increased after a week of atra treatment  <cit> . the data suggest that atra may affect treg cells in a context- and time-dependent manner.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, atra administration significantly decreased th2- and th17-related cytokines and markedly reduced airway inflammation in a murine allergic airway inflammation model. these findings suggested that atra may serve as an effective therapy for allergic airway inflammation. our study suggested potential benefits of vitamin-a supplement for asthma patients and may provide the basis for further investigation of the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of atra or vitamin a in controlling the airway inflammation of asthma.
