BACKGROUND
the foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes uses complex regulatory mechanisms to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions and to cause listeriosis, a life-threatening infection, in humans and animals. a key mechanism used by l. monocytogenes to regulate transcript and protein levels in order to adapt to changing environmental conditions is through alternative sigma  factors. alternative σ factors reprogram the rna polymerase holoenzyme to recognize specific promoters and hence allow for rapid induction of transcription of potentially large groups of genes under specific environmental conditions  <cit> . in l. monocytogenes, four alternative σ factors, σb, σc, σh, and σl, have been identified. however, σc has only been described in l. monocytogenes strains that group into lineage ii, a well defined phylogenetic group that includes serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c  <cit> . a number of studies that have explored σb-mediated stress response as well as σb-mediated gene expression and protein production in l. monocytogenes <cit>  have shown that this alternative σ factor controls a large regulon and contributes to both stress response and virulence.

σh, σl, and σc have not been as extensively characterized as σb in l. monocytogenes, at least partially because studies to date have only identified limited phenotypic consequences of null mutations in these σ factors in l. monocytogenes. among these three alternative σ factors, σh appears to control the largest regulon; chaturongakul et al.  identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes as positively and negatively regulated by σh, respectively, in l. monocytogenes strain 10403s  <cit> . while a l. monocytogenes egd-e sigh mutant was reported to have significantly impaired growth in minimal medium and under alkaline stress conditions as well as slightly reduced virulence potential in a mouse model  <cit> , phenotypic studies in a l. monocytogenes 10403s Δsigh strain did not find evidence for an effect of this mutation on virulence in a guinea pig model, cell invasion and intracellular growth, or resistance to heat stress  <cit> . with regard to σl,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as positively and negatively regulated, respectively, by this σ factor, in l. monocytogenes 10403s  <cit> . a more recent study in l. monocytogenes egd-e identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes as positively regulated by σl when the parent and Δsigl mutant strains were grown at 3°c and 37°c, respectively; most of the  <dig> genes that showed positive regulation by σl under both temperatures were located within prophage a <dig>  <cit> . phenotypic and gene expression studies also support a potential contribution of σl to l. monocytogenes growth under different stress conditions, most notably osmotic and low temperature stress  <cit> . l. monocytogenes σl has also been reported to be involved in resistance to the antimicrobial peptide mesentericin y <dig>  <cit> . finally, studies conducted to date on the l. monocytogenes σc regulon typically identified few genes as σc-dependent. chaturongakul et al.  were only able to identify and confirm, by qrt-pcr, a single gene  as σc-dependent; lmo <dig>  which encodes lstr, a lineage ii specific thermal regulator, is in the same operon as sigc and this finding is consistent with previous data suggesting that the sigc operon is auto-regulated  <cit> . zhang et al.  also found some evidence that σc may contribute to thermal resistance in the l. monocytogenes lineage ii strain 10403s, when grown to log phase  <cit> ; by contrast, chaturongakul et al.  did not find any evidence for reduced heat resistance when an independent l. monocytogenes 10403s Δsigc strain was grown to stationary phase prior to heat exposure  <cit> .

previous studies  <cit>  have suggested considerable overlap between different l. monocytogenes alternative σ factor regulons , suggesting the potential for redundancies as well as compensation for deletion of a single alternative σ factor by other σ factors. we thus hypothesized that an experimental approach that eliminates these potential redundancies is needed to gain a better understanding of the roles of σc, σh, and σl in regulating production of specific proteins in l. monocytogenes. as an experimental approach, we selected to create an l. monocytogenes 10403s quadruple mutant with a non-polar deletion of all four genes that encode alternative σ factors  as well as corresponding mutants with deletions of three alternative σ factors , which thus expressed only σl, σh, and σc, respectively. these strains were then used for proteomic comparisons between the quadruple mutant strain and the three different strains expressing only a single alternative σ factor. we particularly focused on exploring the contributions of these alternative σ factors to regulating protein production as, despite availability of a number of proteomics data sets on the σb regulon  <cit> , only a single proteomics study on the σl regulon is available  <cit> . while alternative σ factors directly regulate transcription of genes, it is increasingly clear that alternative σ factors also make important indirect contributions to protein production via mechanisms other than transcriptional activation of a σ factor dependent promoter upstream of a protein encoding gene, including through regulation of non-coding rnas or through direct transcriptional up-regulation of a protein that in turn, directly or indirectly, affects production of other proteins  <cit> . the goal of this proteomics study was thus to specifically identify additional post-transcriptional regulatory pathways that are linked to the action of alternative σ factors in l. monocytogenes.

RESULTS
proteomic comparisons between l. monocytogenes mutants expressing only σl, σh, and σc and a quadruple mutant that does not express any alternative σ factors, all grown to stationary phase at 37°c, showed that  σh provides, among these three alternative σ factors, positive regulation for the largest number of proteins, consistent with previous transcriptomic studies  <cit> ;  σl appears to contribute to negative regulation of a number of proteins;  σc regulates a small number of proteins in l. monocytogenes grown to stationary phase at 37°c; and  proteins regulated by multiple alternative σ factors include mpta, which has a potential role in regulation of prfa.

σh positively regulates a large number of proteins and appears to directly and indirectly contribute to transport and metabolism of β-glucosides
our proteomic comparison identified  <dig> proteins as positively regulated by σh, as supported by higher protein levels  ≥  <dig> ; p-valuec  <  <dig> ) in l. monocytogenes Δbcl as compared to the Δbchl strain ; four of these  <dig> proteins also showed higher levels in the parent strain  as compared to the quadruple mutant. overall, positive fold changes for these proteins  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these  <dig> proteins represented nine role categories ; a monte carlo simulation of fisher’s exact test did not find a significant association between positively regulated genes and role categories ; however, individual fisher’s exact tests did show overrepresentation of proteins in the role category “amino acid biosynthesis” among the  <dig> proteins that were found to be positively regulated by σh . some of the  <dig> proteins positively regulated by σh have likely roles in stress adaptation and virulence, including lmo <dig>   <cit>  and lmo <dig> , which has been linked to regulation of the virulence gene regulator prfa  <cit> . previously reported transcriptomic studies  <cit>  only identified the coding gene for one of these  <dig> proteins  as σh-dependent; lmo <dig>  was also identified as preceded by a σh consensus promoter, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation by σh. in addition, the coding gene for lmo <dig>  one of these  <dig> proteins, is in an operon with lmo <dig>  which was previously reported to be positively regulated by σh, even though no upstream σh consensus promoter was identified, suggesting indirect regulation  <cit> . rna-seq data from our group  found clear evidence  for σh-dependent transcript levels for only two of the genes encoding these  <dig> proteins, including lmo <dig> and lmo0239; importantly, rna-seq data allow for quantification with similar sensitivity as qrt-pcr  <cit> . lmo <dig> thus has been consistently identified as a gene that is directly up-regulated by σh, as supported by proteomics and transcriptomic studies and identification of an upstream σh-dependent promoter. many of the other proteins identified here as showing σh-dependent production, on the other hand, appear to be regulated indirectly by σh, possibly at the post-transcriptional level. while future efforts will be needed to confirm σh-dependent production of these proteins  and to explore the mechanisms of regulation, our data identified and further characterized a σh-dependent pathway that involves indirect effects of σh. specifically, we found that both lmo <dig>  and bgla  showed higher protein levels in the presence of σh. as lmo <dig> is preceded by a σh consensus promoter, these findings suggest a model where σh directly activates transcription of lmo <dig>  which facilitates pts-based import of beta-glucosides into the cell. we hypothesize that these β-glucosides then lead to an increase in the levels of bgla , facilitating the use of β-glucosides in downstream pathways involved in energy acquisition .

our proteomic comparison also identified four proteins that showed lower levels in the strain expressing σh, suggesting  negative regulation by σh; three of these four proteins also showed lower levels in the parent strain  as compared to the quadruple mutant. none of the genes encoding these proteins showed significantly higher transcript levels in a Δsigh strain in a transcriptomic study  <cit> . however, the coding gene for lmo <dig>  one of these four proteins, is in an operon with lmo <dig>  which was previously reported to be negatively regulated by σh <cit> . overall, global indirect down-regulation of proteins by σh does not seem to play an important role in stationary phase l. monocytogenes 10403s.

σl appears to contribute to negative regulation of a number of proteins
our proteomic comparison identified only two proteins  as positively regulated by σl, as supported by higher protein levels  in l. monocytogenes Δbch as compared to the Δbchl strain . both of these proteins also showed higher levels in the parent strain  as compared to the quadruple mutant. lmo <dig>  is annotated as the mannose-specific pts system iiab component, while lmo <dig>  is annotated as an acetolactate synthase. both lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> have previously been reported to be positively regulated by σl at the transcriptomic level  <cit> . lmo <dig> was also reported as showing lower levels in an l. monocytogenes egd-e rpon  mutant in a 2-de based proteomic analysis  <cit>  and the lmo <dig> gene was found to be preceded by a putative σl consensus promoter in the same study, further supporting positive regulation of the gene encoding this protein by σl.

a total of  <dig> proteins showed lower levels in the presence of σl , suggesting indirect negative regulation of these proteins by σl ; two of the genes encoding these proteins had previously been shown to have higher transcript levels in a Δsigl null mutant as compared to a parent strain, further supporting negative regulation by σl <cit> . twenty-one of the proteins with evidence for negative regulation by σl also showed lower protein levels in the parent strain as compared to the Δbchl strain , further supporting their negative regulation. four of these  <dig> proteins as well as three other proteins found to be negatively regulated by σl in this study were also reported as showing higher transcript levels in an l. monocytogenes egd-e rpon  mutant  <cit>  , supporting their negative regulation by σl. overall, the  <dig> proteins identified here as negatively regulated by σl represented  <dig> role categories , including  <dig> proteins in the energy metabolism role category; statistical analyses showed overrepresentation of the role category “energy metabolism”  among these  <dig> proteins. specific proteins identified as negatively regulated by σl included flagellin , chemotaxis protein chea, and a glutamate-γ-aminobutyric acid  antiporter , which have known roles in stress adaptation or virulence in l. monocytogenes <cit> .

σc regulates a small number of proteins
previous studies indicated a role for σc in l. monocytogenes thermal adaptive response as well as in cold adaptation  <cit> , however only a few genes have been identified as part of the σc regulon  <cit> . similarly, we were only able to identify one protein, lmo <dig>  that showed higher protein levels  in the presence of σc . lmo <dig> has been previously reported to be induced under cold stress in l. monocytogenes <cit> , supporting a role of σc in response to temperature stress in the bacterium. by comparison, the transcriptomic study by chaturongakul et al.,  <dig> only identified lmo <dig>  which is in the same operon as sigc , as positively regulated by σc <cit> .

we also identified two proteins, lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  that showed higher protein levels in the absence of σc, suggesting negative regulation of these proteins by σc . by comparison, the transcriptomic study by chaturongakul et al.  identified three different genes, representing two operons , that showed lower transcript levels in the parent strain compared to the Δsigc mutant, suggesting negative regulation by σc <cit> . while our data are consistent with previous findings of a limited σc regulon in l. monocytogenes 10403s, it is possible that σc- dependent gene regulation only occurs under specific conditions  and that more complete identification of the σc regulon requires transcriptomic and proteomic studies under specific conditions that remain to be defined. in addition, future experiments using an l. monocytogenes strain that expresses sigc from an inducible promoter may also allow for identification of additional proteins that show σc-dependent production; this strategy applied to other alternative σ factors may also allow for identification of additional proteins that show σh- or σl-dependent production.

proteins regulated by multiple alternative σ factors include mpta, which has a potential role in regulation of prfa
our data reported here also provided an opportunity to gather further insight into genes and proteins that are co-regulated by multiple σ factors and, consequently, into regulatory networks among different alternative σ factors. to facilitate these analyses, we also compared the protein levels between the l. monocytogenes parent strain and the Δbchl strain . this analysis identified   <dig> proteins that showed significantly higher levels  in the parent strain as compared to the Δbchl strain  and   <dig> proteins that show lower levels in the parent as compared to the Δbchl mutant . approximately 40% of the proteins that showed differential production  are involved in energy metabolism and transport and binding functions . among the  <dig> proteins that showed higher levels in the parent strain,  two were also found to be positively regulated by σh;  one was also positively regulated by σh and σl, and  one was also positively regulated by σh, σl and σc . in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins that were found to be positively regulated in the parent strain, were also found to be positively regulated by σb in a recent proteomics study, which compared l. monocytogenes parent strain 10403s and Δsigb mutant grown to stationary phase under the same conditions as used here  <cit> . while these  <dig> proteins likely represent proteins that are positively regulated by σb, the other  <dig> proteins that showed higher levels in the parent strain as compared to the Δbchl strain, but were not identified as positively regulated by any of the alternative σ factors, represent candidate proteins for redundant co-regulation by multiple alternative σ factors. future experiments using an l. monocytogenes strain that only expresses σb  may help to not only further define the σb regulon, but also allow for further refinement of genes and proteins co-regulated by multiple alternative σ factors. regulatory redundancy among multiple alternative σ factors has also previously been demonstrated through analyses of bacillus subtilis alternative σ factor mutants; in particular, certain phenotypes displayed by a b. subtilis triple alternative σ factor deletion mutant were not found among single or double mutants of each of the three alternative σ factors, suggesting regulatory overlaps  <cit> .

bproteins that were identified here as positively  or negatively  regulated  by a given σ factor are shown; ndr  indicates that a protein was not found to be differentially regulated between strains with and without a given alternative σ factor.

cdata for proteins differentially regulated by σb were obtained from mujahid et al.  <cit> ; this study compared protein levels between the 10403s parent strain and an isogenic Δsigb strain.

among the  <dig> proteins that showed lower levels in the parent strain as compared to the Δbchl mutant ,  two also showed evidence for negative regulation by σh and σl ;  one also showed evidence for negative regulation by σh, σl, and σc . among these  <dig> proteins, statistical analyses showed overrepresentation of three role categories, including  “energy metabolism” ,  “biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers” , and  “purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, and nucleotides” , as well as underrepresentation of the role category “hypothetical proteins” .

overall, our data provide additional evidence that a number of genes and proteins are co-regulated by more than one σ factor. this is consistent with previous microarray studies  <cit>  that have reported considerable overlaps between σ factor regulons in l. monocytogenes, in particular between the σh and the σb regulon. we also identified some proteins with particularly striking patterns of co-regulation, including  members of the lmo2093-lmo <dig> operon, specifically lmo <dig>  which was found to be negatively regulated by σh, σl, and σc and lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  which were found to be negatively regulated by σh and σl  and  mpta , which was found to be positively regulated by σh, σl, and σc . lmo <dig> shows particularly striking negative regulation of protein production by σh, σl, and σc with respective fold changes of − <dig> , - <dig> , and − <dig> . although lmo <dig> is annotated as a fuculose-phosphate aldolase, it is part of an operon in which most of the other genes with assigned functions are annotated as being involved in the galactitol degradation pathway. specifically, the lmo <dig> to lmo <dig> operon encodes components of a putative pts galactitol family permease  <cit> , including the pts system galactitol-specific enzyme iic , iib , and iia  components, as well as a transcription antiterminator , a tagatose-6-phosphate kinase/1-phosphofructokinase , an l-fuculose-phosphate aldolase , and a hypothetical protein . therefore, it is possible that lmo <dig> is also involved in this pathway functioning as a tagatose- <dig> -biphosphate aldolase. this enzyme converts tagatose- <dig> ,-biphosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which allows both tagatose and galactitol to be used as energy sources for glycolysis  <cit> .

mpta, a component of a permease of the pts mannose–fructose–sorbose family, which is another one of the seven pts families of l. monocytogenes <cit> , showed the highest fold change in the Δbch strain as compared to the Δbchl strain, supporting σl dependent protein levels ; fold changes supporting σh and σc dependent protein levels were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. mpta is encoded by a gene that is part of a three-gene operon ; these three genes encode a mannose-specific pts system iiab component, a mannose-specific pts system iic component, and a mannose-specific pts system iid component, respectively  <cit> . recently, it was suggested that during glucose uptake, mpta dephosphorylates, which directly, or indirectly, inhibits prfa, the major positive regulator of l. monocytogenes virulence genes  <cit> . these findings thus provide for a hypothesis that redundant upregulation of mpta, through multiple alternative σ factors, may provide a critical initial step towards inactivation of prfa.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptional regulation through the interplay between alternative σ factors represents an important component of l. monocytogenes stress response systems and the ability of this pathogen to regulate gene expression during infection. in addition to transcriptional regulation, alternative σ factors may also regulate protein production post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally. to allow for further insights into the roles of different alternative σ factors in l. monocytogenes, we thus completed a global evaluation of alternative σ factor-dependent protein production patterns in l. monocytogenes stationary phase cells. in concert with previous transcriptomic studies, our data not only provide a further refinement of our understanding of the alternative σ factor regulons in this important pathogen, but also provide clear evidence for co-regulation, by multiple σ factors, of different pts systems, including one pts system that has been suggested to be linked to regulation of prfa. co-regulation by multiple σ factors can provide sensitive means for fine-tuning of gene expression and protein production under different environmental conditions, as well as redundancy that can ensure gene expression and protein production under different conditions. consistent with the goals of this study, many of the proteins that were identified as showing production dependent on the presence of alternative σ factors appear to represent indirect regulation by a given σ factor, which will require future confirmation by protein based methods .
