BACKGROUND
the fungal kingdom comprises a large group of organisms  with only 5% identified thus far. fungal species can survive in virtually all biotopes on earth, as they have been identified in water and soil, and on plants and animals. part of their success comes from the ability to use different reproductive strategies, which provide increased flexibility for diverse environmental requirements. fungal species can produce sexual cells and/or asexual cells in distinct reproductive structures. some fungi are able to reproduce both sexually and asexually depending on the circumstances, while others display one mode of reproduction, only. sexual reproduction and recombination allows the repair of naturally occurring mutations and results in new genotypes and phenotypes that allow for natural selection  <cit> . on the other hand, asexual reproduction provides the ability to disperse numerous genetically identical mitospores, without the metabolic costs of sexual reproduction  <cit> .

aspergillus niger is an ascomycetous fungus that is considered to reproduce through asexual spores, only. since a. niger is used as a host for the production of homologous and heterologous proteins and commercially important compounds , the potential presence of a sexual cycle is highly significant for strain improvement. recent analysis of the a. niger genome has revealed the presence of a full complement of genes related to sexual reproduction  <cit> . it was therefore suggested that there could be a latent sexual potential in a. niger. a similar observation applies to aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus oryzae, both only known to reproduce asexually, so far. comparison of the two genomes to the genome of aspergillus nidulans , which has a known sexual cycle, suggests that both a. fumigatus and a. oryzae may be capable of sexual reproduction  <cit> . it has yet to be determined whether genes related to sexual reproduction in supposedly asexual fungi are functional.

dioxygenase genes with homology to mammalian prostaglandin synthase  have been connected to the formation of oxylipins in a. nidulans. dioxygenase genes and oxylipins are linked to reproduction as they regulate the balance between sexual and asexual sporulation  <cit> . the goal of this study was to investigate whether or not oxylipins and dioxygenase genes related to sexual reproduction are also present in the asexual fungus a. niger.

RESULTS
rp-hplc analysis
a crude extract of a. niger n <dig> biomass was incubated with 18: <dig> and the reaction mixture was extracted with spe and analyzed on rp-hplc. a typical hplc chromatogram is shown in fig.  <dig>  incubation with 18: <dig> resulted in the appearance of three large peaks in the hplc chromatogram and a smaller one. similar results were obtained for a. niger uu-a <dig> , a. niger Δppoa , a. niger Δppod  and a. nidulans wg <dig> . for each strain, fatty acid reaction products were fractionated on hplc and after derivatization further investigated with gc/ms. structures of oxygenated fatty acids were deduced from the spectra of the tms ethers of methyl ester derivatives.

gc/ms analysis of dihydroxy fatty acids 
hydrogenated dihydroxy fatty acids as tms ethers of methyl ester derivatives from rp-hplc peak  <dig>  were separated on gc and one dominant peak was present in the chromatogram. the mass spectrum was similar that of the tms ether of methyl  <dig> -dihydroxy octadecanoate  <cit> . the gc retention time and mass spectrum of the non-hydrogenated sample and the gc retention time and mass spectrum of tms ether of methyl  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -octadecadienoate showed that the major fatty acid product in rp-hplc peak  <dig>  was  <dig> -dihydroxy octadecadienoic acid   <cit> .

hydrogenated rp-hplc peak  <dig>  as tms ether of methyl ester derivative was separated on gc and one dominant peak was present in the chromatogram. the mass spectrum showed characteristic peaks stemming from cleavages around the two oxygenated c atoms that indicated the presence of tms ether of methyl  <dig> -dihydroxy octadecanoate. comparison of the mass spectrum from hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated samples showed that the tms ether of methyl  <dig> -dihydroxy octadecanoate was derived from the tms ether of methyl  <dig> -dihydroxy- <dig> -octadecadienoate. this was evidenced by the molecular ion at m/z  <dig> and by the characteristic fragments resulting from cleavage around the double bonds and oxygenated c atoms  <cit> . thus rp-hplc peak  <dig>  proved to be  <dig> -dihod.

rp-hplc peak 2* was analyzed as a part of rp-hplc peak  <dig>  due to overlap. hydrogenation of the tms ether derivative showed peaks stemming from cleavage around an oxygenated c-atom. the molecular ion at m/z  <dig> evidenced that this compound was tms ether of lactonized  <dig> -dihydroxyoctadecanoate. comparing the hydrogenated sample with the non-hydrogenated sample showed that tms ether of lactonized  <dig> -dihydroxy octadecanoate probably originated from lactonized  <dig> -dihod.

gc/ms analysis of monohydroxy fatty acids 
in the gc chromatogram of the hydrogenated monohydroxy fatty acids of rp-hplc peak  <dig>  as tms ethers of methyl ester derivatives, one prominent peak was present. the mass spectrum identified it as a mixture of the tms ethers of methyl 8-hydroxy octadecanoate, methyl 10-hydroxy octadecanoate and a small amount of methyl 9-hydroxy octadecanoate. also, a small peak of methyl 13-hydroxy octadecanoate was present in the gc chromatogram. in the gc/ms analysis of the corresponding non-hydrogenated monohydroxy fatty acids as tms ethers of methyl ester derivatives, three peaks were visible in the gc chromatogram. reference compounds indicated that gc peak  <dig>  was tms ether of methyl 8-hydroxy octadecadienoate because of the fragmentation pattern and retention time of the non-hydrogenated sample  <cit> . the mass spectrum of tms ether of methyl 10-hydroxy octadecanoate, gc peak  <dig> , showed that this compound originated from 10-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid . the mass spectrum of gc peak  <dig>  and the mass spectra of reference compounds showed that tms ethers of methyl 13-hydroxy octadecanoate and methyl 9-hydroxy decanoate were derived from 13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid  and 9-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid , respectively. thus, rp-hplc peak  <dig>  was composed of 8-hod , 10-hod , 13-hod  and 9-hod .

gc/ms analysis of monohydroxy fatty acids eluting after rp-hplc peak  <dig>  as tms ethers of methyl ester derivatives showed that a small amount of 8-hom was also present .

characteristics of oxylipin formation
incubation with  18: <dig> showed that all oxygenated fatty acid products  represented a mixture of converted 18: <dig> from endogenous and exogenous sources. the conversion of  <dig> nmol exogenously supplied 18: <dig> was about 50% of the total conversion, as judged by the ratio of  labeled fragments to unlabeled fragments on gc/ms. in a reaction with 20: <dig> was shown that 20: <dig> it was not converted by an a. niger n <dig> crude extract.

endogenous oxylipins
endogenous oxylipins of a. niger n <dig> biomass were extracted and analyzed on gc/ms. oxylipin levels were very low when compared to the total ion-current of the internal standard 17: <dig>  traces of  <dig> -dihod,  <dig> -dihod, 8-hod, 10-hod, 13-hod and 8-hom were detected, however, oxylipin levels were generally just above background. similar results were obtained for a. niger uu-a <dig> , a. niger Δppoa , a. niger Δppod  and a.nidulans wg <dig> 

identification of three putative a. niger dioxygenase genes, ppoa, ppoc and ppod
a search of the a. niger n <dig> genomic database identified three putative dioxygenase genes ppoa, ppoc and ppod that are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and contained  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> introns, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of ppoa , ppoc  and ppod  represented proteins with strong homology to g. graminis lds. a. niger ppoa and ppoc were closely related to a. nidulans ppoa and ppoc . comparing the sequence of a. niger ppod with those of ppoa, ppob and ppoc from a. nidulans showed that a. niger ppod had strongest similarity to a. nidulans ppoa and ppoc and not to a. nidulans ppob .

in analogy with g. graminis lds and a. nidulans ppo's, a. niger ppoa, ppoc and ppod showed homology to animal pgs . a. niger ppoa, ppoc and ppod also contained the distal  and proximal  his, and tyr  residues, essential for catalytic activity of pgs. amino acid analysis of the predicted proximal his domain revealed that ppod differed from the other aspergillus ppo's in having a phe  instead of a trp residue between the proximal his and tyr residues and that a lys, conserved in the other ppo's, was replaced by a gln  residue 

putative a. niger ppoa and ppoc contained the proline knot motif that targets proteins to oil bodies in plants  <cit> . in contrast a. niger ppod did not contain the proline knot motif, the third pro residue was replaced by an arg residue .

phenotypic characterization of a. niger transformants
to study the connection of the a. niger putative dioxygenase genes to oxylipin formation and reproduction, ppoa and ppod were inactivated by homologous recombination of the domain encoding the catalytic site with the argb cassette. a. niger Δppoa and Δppod mutants had no alterations in radial growth. also their response to osmotic, oxidative and temperature stress, and combinations thereof, did not differ from the reaction of the wild type. no effect on sporulation was observed for the ppoa and ppod disruption strains or the ppoa multicopy strain. however, a 34% reduction in conidiospores was observed in the ppoc multicopy strain. in experiments where linoleic acid was added, all strains showed reduced conidiospore counts compared to the wild type.

a. niger microarray analysis
analysis of expression levels of a. niger putative dioxygenases ppoa, ppoc and ppod showed that the three genes were expressed from the center to the periphery of the a. niger colonies grown on maltose, however, the level of expression differed . the genes ppoa and ppod were expressed mainly in the periphery, while levels of ppoc expression were equally distributed throughout the colony and low in comparison to the expression of ppoa and ppod. similar results were obtained during growth on d-xylose . since the a. niger strains were grown in sandwiched cultures, the formation of conidia was suppressed. expression profiles of dioxygenase genes may be different in sporulating colonies.

discussion
the goal of this study was to investigate whether or not oxylipins and dioxygenase genes, that are related to both asexual and sexual reproduction, are present in the asexual fungus a. niger.

using rp-hplc and gc/ms, this study demonstrated that a. niger converted 18: <dig> mainly into  <dig> -dihod,  <dig> -dihod, lactonized  <dig> -dihod, 8-hod and 10-hod. the reaction with  18: <dig> showed that these compounds were produced from a mixture of exogenously added and endogenously present 18: <dig> 

the presence of  <dig> -dihod, lactonized  <dig> -dihod, 8-hod and 10-hod, but not the presence of  <dig> -dihod were reported in a. nidulans  <cit>  and related to sexual reproduction  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study  <dig> -dihod was one of the oxylipins formed by a. nidulans. during the preparation of this manuscript, a study was published showing that the asexual fungus a. fumigatus also produced  <dig> -dihod,  <dig> -dihod 8-hod and 10-hod  <cit> . this indicates that a. niger, a. nidulans and a. fumigatus all produce the same oxylipins.

analysis of the a. niger genome revealed that this fungus contains three putative dioxygenase genes, ppoa, ppoc and ppod. a ppob homologue was not present. a. niger transformants lacking the ppoa or ppod gene were not altered in their ability to produce oxylipins and sporulation. a reduction in conidiospore formation was observed in the ppoc multicopy strain. in contrast, in a. nidulans ppoa, ppob or ppoc were found to be connected to oxylipin production and to modification of sexual and asexual sporulation. deletion of ppoa, ppob or ppoc was demonstrated to reduce the level of 8-hod, 8-hom and 8-hom, respectively  <cit> . but a later study showed that deletion of ppoa led to a reduction of 8-hod and  <dig> -dihod formation and that elimination of ppoc reduced 10-hod formation  <cit> . the removal of ppob did not alter oxylipin production  <cit> . in addition, deletion of ppoa or ppob from the a. nidulans genome increased the ratio of asexual to sexual spores  <cit> . elimination of ppoc on the other hand, significantly reduced the ratio of asexual to sexual spores  <cit> . absence of a phenotype for the disruption strains of a. niger for ppoa and ppod, could suggest that they are non-essential or that they in fact have the same function. future studies into these genes should include construction of double-disruptants. the inability to isolate ppoc disruptants might suggest that this is an essential gene in a. niger even though this is not the case in a. nidulans  <cit>  and could possibly indicate significant differences in the role of these genes in different fungi. when linoleic acid was added, all strains showed reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type, suggesting that addition of linoleic acid could not be compensated for when the production of the different ppo's is altered in a. niger.

a. niger ppod had deviating amino acid residues in the vicinity of the proximal his domain and did not contain the proline knot motif . this motif targets plant proteins to oil bodies and it has been demonstrated that fungi target such proteins to oil bodies as well  <cit> . in addition, the proline knot is predicted to facilitate the formation of an antiparallel α-helix or β-strand  <cit> . therefore, a. niger ppod likely differs from the other ppo's in its three dimensional structure it could be argued that the presence of ppod instead of ppob in a. niger is related to the reproductive differences between a. niger and a. nidulans. however, this seems unlikely since the genomes of aspergillus clavatus, aspergillus oryzae and aspergillus terreus, all not known to reproduce sexually, do contain ppob homologues. additionally, histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus belonging to the same class as the aspergilli, contains ppod and also does not contain ppob, but is able to produce sexual spores  <cit> . expression analysis of a. niger ppoa, ppoc and ppod shows that these genes are expressed and their expression levels depend on the fungus' developmental stage . it should be noted that a. niger is heterothallic and requires mating between two isolates with different mating types. despite the fact that a. niger appears to contain all the genes required for a sexual cycle, until now, no sexual cycle has been observed for a. niger on any of a broad range of growth conditions . in contrast, a. nidulans is a homothallic species in which both mating types are present in a single strain and can therefore cross with itself. this difference might hint towards different strategies for regulation of sexual and asexual development. studies of these genes in other homothallic and heterothallic aspergilli, could demonstrate whether this is a general difference between homothallic and heterothallic species. this could include the presence or absence of expression of specific dioxygenase genes.

strictly asexual species are considered an evolutionary endpoint, and truly asexual species are thought to be extremely rare  <cit> . sequencing of fungal genomes and comparative analysis of sexual and asexual species show that fungi that have long been considered asexual organisms, may have a latent potential for sexual reproduction  <cit> . nevertheless, the presence of sex related genes alone, does not confirm sexual reproduction.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that a. niger produces the same oxylipins and has similar dioxygenase genes as a. nidulans. even though, the functionality of these genes remains as yet to be proven, their presence could point towards the existence of sexual reproduction in a. niger or a broader role for the gene products in physiology, than just sexual development.
