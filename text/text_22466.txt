BACKGROUND
endolithic phototrophs are major primary producers  <cit>  and microbioeroders in marine carbonate substrata  <cit> . they may colonize the surface and cavities of the substratum , as well as actively penetrate it  wherever sufficient light penetrates for photosynthesis. they may be found in aragonite, calcite, or a combination of both, in e.g. live and dead corals, mollusk shells, and crustose coralline algae   <cit> . in calcium carbonate caco3-building ecosystems, such as cca ridges, coral reefs, oyster reefs and rhodolith beds, euendolithic phototrophs play a critical role in the dynamic balance between constructive  and destructive  processes  <cit> . with upcoming global changes, this balance may be negatively affected by enhancing the bioerosive power of boring phototrophs, as measured under projected ocean acidification  and increased temperature regimes  <cit> . the prospect of accelerated biogenic caco <dig> dissolution poses strong concerns for the future maintenance of the structural integrity and functionality of these ecosystems considering the biodiverse assemblages of micro- and macro-organisms they support  <cit> .

commonly reported euendolithic phototrophs include the eukaryotic green algal genera ostreobium bornet and flahault  and phaeophila hauck  , and prokaryotic  blue-green algal genera  such as mastigocoleus lagerheim ex bornet and flahault, and plectonema thuret ex gomont  <cit> . they also include microscopic alternate life stages of otherwise conspicuous alga, e.g. the conchocelis-stage of the red alga porphyra c. agardh  and endolithic vegetative networks underlying diminutive epilithic bryopsidales, e.g. pseudochlorodesmis børgesen and caulerpa ambigua okamura  <cit> . among the above, ostreobium microsiphons are omnipresent agents of bioerosion  <cit> , although the microfilaments of the genus phaeophila are also often reported . the molecular diversity of ostreobium spp. remains particularly unexplored toward establishing comprehensive sequence reference databases for the profiling of endolithic communities via metabacording .

the skeleton of reef-building scleractian coral species  is abundantly colonized by ostreobium  <cit>  , in which it develops a dense green layer underlying the animal tissue and where, as part of the coral holobiont, it may play a role as a nutritional ally . previously, gutner-hoch and fine  <cit>  investigated the molecular diversity of this ‘green layer’ with rbcl in two coral species from the red sea in order to gain insights into potential patterns of association of ostreobium haplotypes with coral species. while these authors reported some possible haplotype-to-coral species distributional patterns, they also revealed multiple rbcl haplotypes of ostreobium, whose taxonomic breadth remains unknown  from a lack of phylogenetic context in their analysis. earlier, verbruggen et al.  <cit>  suggested that the genus ostreobium might actually represent an entire suborder of microsiphonous species that they informally proposed as the ‘ostreobidineae’  based on the early branching of a single ostreobium specimen in a comprehensive multi-marker phylogeny of the bryopsidales ; however, this remains to be substantiated. overall, considering the high density of ostreobium microsiphons in the so-called coral ‘green layer’, this microhabitat is particularly convenient to target in order to rapidly build reference barcode data sets.fig.  <dig>

metabarcoding represents a novel terminology  <cit>  for amplicon-based metagenomics  in contrast to whole-genome metagenomics  <cit> . important limitations to metabarcoding include the availability of universal primers amplifying the targeted diversity with minimal taxon bias  <cit> , the clustering of next-generation reads into biologically relevant operational taxonomic unit  through the elimination of sequencing error/noise , and building up taxonomy-curated reference sequence database for otu identification/annotation . currently, a metabarcoding framework specifically developed to target lower phototrophs  and their recovery in large proportions of reads is inexistent and is sorely needed to facilitate the monitoring of endolithic phototrophs and other microbial/algal assemblages. a recent progress toward metabarcoding phototrophs was made with the establishment of a curated chloroplast 16s rdna database ; however, primers used to amplify 16s are generally highly conserved in prokaryotes and tend to recover low proportions of phototrophic organisms from environmental mixtures where microbial dna from heterotrophic phyla is inherently overdominant. for instance, in a study of freshwater phytoplankton communities with 16s , only 9 % of reads represented phototrophic organisms  <cit> . likewise, 16s libraries sequenced from coral tissue and their underlying endolithic communities enumerated very few phototrophs in comparison to heterotrophs .

a candidate dna marker for metabarcoding phototrophs is the gene encoding the protein chain elongation factor ef-tu, or tufa, whose role in the rna translation machinery is deeply conserved among eubacteria and their eukaryotic endosymbiotic offshoot, the organelles  <cit> , especially in the chloroplast . iwabe et al.  <cit>  first used the elongation factors ef-tu  to examine deep  phylogenetic relationships . later, delwiche et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the cyanobacterial  origin of all plastids in a single-gene phylogeny of tufa rooted with heterotrophs. subsequently, tufa has gained much popularity in phylogenetic and systematic studies of diverse phototrophs  and was also recommended as a standard marker for the routine barcoding of the chlorophyta  <cit>  for its high amplification rate , and faster evolving rate relative to other commonly used markers in this phylum . in early branching members of the streptophyta , tufa is chloroplast-encoded while in the remainder of this phylum , it is nuclear-encoded  <cit> . in some eubacteria , including some cyanophyta, e.g. in the oscillatoriales , tufa paralogs known as elongation factor ef-tu  <dig> or tufb may exist  <cit> ; however, these usually undergo concerted evolution and thus exhibit very low divergence  <cit> . considering the universality of tufa and the large amount of data available on genbank® for the order bryopsidales , this marker is thus well-suited for the barcoding of ostreobium spp. and metabarcoding of microfloras dominated by its microsiphons and associated algal diversity.

here, we established a metabacording framework consisting of newly developed primers, a curated database of phototrophic diversity , a provisional classification scheme for cryptic endoliths in the order bryopsidales, and recommended identity thresholds for the taxonomic annotation of phototrophs at high levels  and at lower levels in the ulvophyceae . this framework, geared toward molecular ecology studies of endolithic phototroph assemblages rich in bioeroding ulvophycean taxa , is tested on four illumina-metabarcoded caco <dig> microfloras.

methods
building up ostreobium and reference tufa diversity
ostreobium specimens were sequenced primarily from the caco <dig> of densely colonized coral skeletons collected throughout the ryukyu archipelago and culture starters established from them . a few additional specimens originated from endolithic siphons underlying rhodolith-forming encrusting red algae from the gulf of mexico  and also from starters established from oyster shells collected in florida and corals from miscellaneous localities . for culturing, colonized blocks of caco <dig> were subsetted to ~ <dig> – <dig>  cm <dig> and incubated for 10–20 days in 60 ml polypropylene cups  with 20–30 ml half strength provasoli enriched seawater medium  <cit>  supplemented with  <dig>  mg/l germanium dioxide  under light–dark 14: <dig> cycles  and at room temperature . specimens were extracted with a dneasy plant mini kit  and tufa amplified by polymerase chain reaction  as previously published  <cit>  and/or with novel primers in various combination . successful pcr products were sanger-sequenced commercially and chromatograms assembled in sequencher v. <dig>  . to further increase reference sequence context, tufa barcodes were also generated for macroscopic  and diminutive members of the bryopsidales  . likewise, miscellaneous ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’ that occasionally emerged in cultures  as well as several florideophyceae  and few phaeophyceae  maintained in the algal collections at the university of louisiana at lafayette  were also barcoded . corals and reef substratum collections in the ryukyu archipelago were conducted under permit 24- <dig> delivered by the okinawa prefecture fishery control 33-2- <dig>  collections in florida’s coastal waters were permitted by a ‘saltwater fishing’ license from the fish and wildlife  and those from garden key, dry tortugas by the u.s. national park service .fig.  <dig> free-living ostreobium in culture. a specimen belonging in provisional family ‘hamidaceae’ , b ‘maedaceae’ , and c ‘odoaceae’ . no picture is available for the ‘unarizakiaceae’. scale bar 50 µm

microflora samples
several microflora specimens were selected for environmental sequencing to build a clone library and for metabarcoding . these consisted of limestone fragments from reef rubble or substratum adjacent to coral colonies originating from the ryukyu archipelago , the florida keys  and a northwestern gulf of mexico rhodolith . these specimens were lightly drilled within caco <dig> patches devoid of crustose epiliths with a sterile  <dig>  mm  bit mounted on a flex-shaft attachment  powered by a dremel  <dig> rotary tool . for each microflora sample, dna from a total of 40-80 mg of pulverized caco <dig> obtained from multiple drills was extracted with a powersoil dna isolation kit . samples jp <dig> to jp <dig> were each extracted from limestone fragments pooled from multiple locations in the ryukyus to maximize tufa sequence diversity. four of the above microflora samples were metabarcoded ; samples jp <dig> and fl <dig> were densely colonized with endolithic taxa whereas samples fl <dig> and gm <dig> were more lightly colonized  and were thus metabarcoded at different sequencing depths . in preliminary cloning assays, two miscellaneous environmental samples comprising an aquarium window scrap exhibiting encrusting ulvophyceae , and endoliths underlaying a crustose coralline lithophyllum sp. specimen  were also processed .table  <dig> limestone samples processed via cloning and metabarcoding

tufa microflora assays
degenerate primers  were designed with hyden  <cit>  on a phylogenetically diverse alignment of phototroph sequences. these primers target a  <dig> base pair  amplicon  that is nested in the 3′ half of tufa . the produced amplicon does not overlap with the 5′ intron found in the euglenophyta  <cit> , and is devoid of codon insertion/deletions . pcr products for cloning or illumina-metabarcoding were amplified from dna extracts on a low temperature/long annealing and long extension cycle to maximize diversity recovery . samples generally required 1:10th to 1:100th dilution for successful amplification due to dna extract concentration variation and/or the potential presence of pcr inhibitors commonly found in algal samples . for cloning, pcr products were separated with a topo® ta cloning® kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. clones were grown on lb agar plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 40 µg/ml x-gal. pcr was performed on white colonies with primers env_tufaf and m13r  and conditions as above. colony pcr products of correct size were sequenced commercially and assembled in sequencher v <dig> . for metabarcoding, dna extracts were shipped to mrdna , where pcr products were amplified using a hotstartaq plus master mix kit  with indexed env_tufaf primers . the amplification of the densely colonized samples jp <dig> and fl <dig> at mrdna produced strong pcr products, while the more lightly colonized samples gm <dig> and fl <dig> resulted in weaker pcr products . thus, jp <dig> and fl <dig> products were pooled in higher proportion for deep sequencing while products from fl <dig> and gm <dig> were normalized and pooled with microbiota assays from other customers  to produce a nominal  <dig>  reads per assay . the prepared library  was sequenced on the lane of an illumina miseq platform .fig.  <dig> metabarcoding tufa. a location of the metabarcode along 1251 bp of tufa displaying sites with conserved a/t  and g/c  nucleotides, insertion-deletions regions , and percentage of maximum entropy . note the lower proportion of conserved sites  within the metabarcode. b site conservation within the forward  and reverse  priming regions. all of the above were produced with  weblogo  <dig> 



de novo clustering of tufa otus
raw miseq reads were processed with the usearch pipeline   <cit>  to overlap paired-ends , demultiplexing , filter for high quality reads  of appropriate size , global trimming , and removal of noisy reads after dereplication , as well as chimeras and contaminants  with uchime  and ublast  . the dereplication file  was then clustered with uparse  at the recommended 97 % global threshold and with swarm  <cit>  at multiple local thresholds  to explore its clustering optima . uparse  and swarm  outputs were then parsed to identify robust core otus generated by both algorithms to follow recent recommendations for reproducibility with the use of multiple algorithms  <cit> . core otus were then mapped at the 97 % level  against the quality-filtered  reads  to produce an otu abundance table . cumulative and non-cumulative rank-abundance curves were built from this table to explore the microflora’s assemblage structure.table  <dig> remaining reads throughout the uparse pipeline as counts and percentage of raw reads

tufa reference database
genbank®’s tufa sequences were summarized into a non-redundant local database augmented with newly generated sanger data . we retrieved with blastn the  <dig>  closest matches to multiple tufa sequences representing major branches of photosynthetic algal diversity . search results were pooled, filtered for sequences >300 bp, and dereplicated . following preliminary tree building, sequences of prokaryotic heterotrophs  were segregated and used for separate searches as above. the numerous resulting heterotroph sequences were dereplicated at 99 %. we excluded the non-photosynthetic apicoplast-encoded tufa of the apicomplexa  <cit>  and the nuclear-encoded tufa of the streptophyta  <cit>  because of conflicting phylogenetic signal  and irrelevance to the target group/habitat investigated herein . nonetheless, the deepest branch of the streptophyta, i.e. the charophyte algae mesostigma and chlorokybus  <cit>  were maintained in the database because their tufa is chloroplast-encoded. the only two sequences available for the terrestrial order trentepohliales  were also excluded for their large divergence with other eukaryotic tufa and ambiguous phylogenetic placement . the final sorted tufa database comprised  <dig> sequences . we followed phyto-ref for the classification of diatoms  and otherwise followed the algaebase class-scheme  <cit> . within the ulvophyceae, we adopted the combined notation ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’  <cit> . a summary of the database sequence content is provided in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

tufa phylogenies
phylogenetic reconstruction of the tufa database was performed to visualize its diversity and for clade-based  identification of clones and otu sequences . in order to produce a diverse heterotroph outgroup while greatly reducing sequence number for efficient computation time, we ‘framed’ bacterial reference diversity by selecting the most distant haplotypes in large clades observed in preliminary trees . the final dataset comprising  <dig> sequences was translated into amino acids and aligned with muscle  <cit> . regions with poor homology  were cropped between sites of conserved amino acids  and the sequences translated back to nucleic acids. the final alignment  was then ran with raxml-hpc <dig> on the cipres computer cluster  with a gtr+i+g model of evolution partitioned per codon position,  <dig> topological searches from random restarts and  <dig> bootstrap replicates for node support estimation. to further detail diversity in euendolithic ulvophyceae, and for species delimitation analyses , the above phototroph alignment was subsetted for the orders bryopsidales and ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’ and few outgroup taxa. previously dereplicated barcode data were reintroduced to show sampling effort in these orders. the final alignment comprising  <dig> sequences was used for phylogenetic analysis as listed above  and species delimitation analyses . all trees were edited in itol  <cit> .

ulvophycean species delimitation
branch lengths were extracted from the raxml ulvophyceae tree with function cophenetic.phylo of the package ape in r  <cit>  to produce a distance matrix as input for the standalone version of the automatic barcode gap discovery software . the latter was run with minimum  and maximum  intraspecific distance priors comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig> in  <dig> steps, and with a  <dig>  relative gap width. alternative species boundaries hypotheses were produced with the general mixed yule coalescence  model with the package splits in r  <cit> , with the single threshold method based on an ultrametric tree generated in beast v <dig>   <cit>  using a relaxed log-normal clock with a constant population coalescent as prior, and a gtr+i+g model of evolution partitioned per codon position. markov chain monte carlo  chains were run for  <dig> million generations  and the quality of the run assessed in tracer v <dig>   <cit>  to ensure that effective sample size  values were > <dig> with the default burnin .

divergence and identity thresholds
the tufa database alignment was cropped to the metabarcode length  and a pairwise percent identity matrix created with function dist.dna in package ape  . from this distance matrix, boxplots depicting the amount of divergence within individual families, suborders and orders of the ulvophyceae  were drawn in order to examine their validity. next, to define clade-based  identity thresholds for the rapid annotation of otu at multiple taxonomic ranks, the function sppdist of the package spider in r  <cit>  was used to compute the overall intra- and inter- clade divergence values for all phototrophs at high-levels ranks  and at lower levels for the ulvophyceae . in silico  thresholds for the above ranks were also assessed by scoring taxonomic discrepancies between an otu’s best hit  and its topological reference taxonomy. from this procedure, the distribution of correctly and incorrectly classified hits was reported . finally, to assess the overall performance of the database in light of annotation thresholds defined above , the distributions of otus’ best hit  against the database was plotted for all phototrophic and ulvophycean otus, as well as for the most abundant otus  in each of the metabarcoded samples.

availability of supporting data
the annotated database and annotated core otus are available in the dryad repository, doi: <dig> /dryad.6cj8h. newly barcoded specimens and clones are deposited in genbank®  and the raw illumina dataset on the national center for biotechnology and information  sequence read archive .

RESULTS
dna sequencing
a total of  <dig> specimens were barcoded with tufa  among which  <dig> were new representatives of ‘ostreobium’ spp.  . cloning resulted in the sequencing of  <dig> bacterial colonies, which after dereplication represented a library of  <dig> unique tufa sequences, including  <dig> chlorophyta,  <dig> cyanophyta,  <dig> rhodophyta, one haptophyta and eight ochrophyta . the shared miseq run output was a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw paired-end reads for the four microfloras tested. upon data processing throughout the usearch pipeline, read numbers gradually decreased, leaving 27 % of the raw data for otu abundance mapping and ~17 % for clustering . clustering at multiple levels with swarm  output from  <dig> to  <dig> otus. swarm indicated a clear clustering optima between local thresholds of d = 10– <dig> , where the number of common otus with uparse did not vary . clustering at the 97 % recommended global threshold with uparse generated  <dig> otus, the majority but  <dig> were also produced by swarm. the  <dig> core otus common to swarm and uparse mapped to  <dig> , <dig>  of the  <dig> , <dig> reads available  . the number of otus and their final read counts for each of the microflora samples clearly reflected the differential sequencing depth carried at mrdna. non-cumulative ranked abundance curves demonstrated 3– <dig> otus strongly dominating each of the microfloras and the presence of numerous low abundance otus . cumulative curves  demonstrated rapid plateauing of mapped read abundance . phototrophs represented  <dig> out of the  <dig> robust otus, i.e. 77 % of otus  and overall 98 % of mapped reads  .table  <dig> otu counts and corresponding read counts per microflora sample

phototroph phylogeny
phylogenetic reconstruction of phototrophic tufa diversity recovered topological features congruent with those presented in delwiche et al.  <cit> , albeit with much denser taxon sampling. the resulting tree was characterized by a poorly resolved backbone with higher resolution at lower taxonomic levels. phylum para/polyphyly was caused by the nesting of secondary endosymbiotic phyla  among extent members of early  lineages of the rhodophyta and chlorophyta  <cit>  from which they diversified . a few classes are also para/polyphyletic in congruence with known taxonomic discrepancies . subclasses of the cyanophyta  are also mostly polyphyletic  and distributed between two major clades . overall, the phototrophic diversity comprised in the database includes  <dig> classes in  <dig> phyla . several phylogenetic landmarks in the evolution of photosynthetic organisms are highlighted on the tree .fig.  <dig> phototrophic diversity. raxml tree displaying  <dig> tufa sequences of ‘phototrophs’  rooted with  <dig> sequences of ‘heterotrophs’  and based on an alignment of 891 bp. the tree was edited in itol for bootstrap support, otu abundance  and taxonomy . a few phylogenetic landmarks are reported on the tree margin as well as stems leading to orders of the ulvophyceae 



otu richness and abundance
the phylogenetic distribution of otus  is clearly visible on the phototroph tree  and allowed their classification  to  <dig> classes in seven phyla. all but  <dig> eukaryotic otus could not be assigned with confidence to a specific class within the phylum they branched in ; however, these otus represented very few reads . the densely colonized microfloras fl <dig> and jp <dig>  exhibited particularly similar richness profiles for phylum, class, and ulvophycean family . together, these two microfloras harbored  <dig> phototrophic otus,  <dig> of which were assigned to both samples following demultiplexing . their abundance profiles were also similar except at the family level . by comparison, the less dense microfloras fl <dig> and gm <dig>  showed skewed profiles toward particular groups and much fewer otus . in the coral reef samples , the cyanophyceae  and ‘bacillariophyta’  were found in low read abundance but revealed tremendous otu diversity , while the coccolithophyceae , the pedinophyceae and ulvophyceae  and the florideophyceae  were found in large read abundance but were much less diverse . in the rhodolith sample , the florideophyceae were particularly abundant.

ulvophyceae phylogeny
the phylogenetic estimation made on the ulvophyceae dataset  resulted in nearly identical branching features than within the larger tree except for a few differences in the bryopsidales . the bryopsidales and the ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’ radiations each received strong bootstrap support . overall, the tree details  <dig> families, some accepted taxonomically, others provisionally delimited here based on topological features and clade divergence. ‘ostreobium’ is revealed as a polyphyletic form genus representing a complex of family-level clades . most of its diversity is monophyletic within a large, confirmed subordinal-level clade, the ostreobidineae , whose divergence is particularly consistent with other suborders, the bryopsidineae and the halimedineae . in this suborder, four ‘ostreobium’ families are provisionally delimited and named from their location of collection in the ryukyus for the purpose of molecular classification . few otus are found in the phylogenetic vicinity of the ‘maedaceae’ and presently cannot be assigned to a family clade . additional ‘ostreobium’ diversity is found in a remote family-level clade of the suborder halimedineae provisionally assigned for taxonomic simplicity to the ‘pseudostreobiaceae’ . our barcoding efforts also further documented members of the diminutive epilithic, polyphyletic form genus ‘pseudochlorodesmis’ delimited here in two provisionally family-level clades named based on their taxonomic history  <cit> , i.e. the ‘pseudochlorodesmidaceae’ and siphonogramenaceae’ . other ‘pseudochlorodesmis’ spp.  represented primordia of otherwise conspicuous taxa in families of the halimedineae  and neotenic thalli within the rhipiliaceae  <cit>  and the caulerpaceae . barcoding of diminutive, simple bryopsidineae also revealed numerous unresolved/unknown taxa in the phylogenetic vicinity of the derbesiaceae and bryopsidaceae . several epilithic families are found endolithically as seen by the presence of otus in their clade  supposedly as reproductive cells, germlings and/or endolithic siphonous networks).fig.  <dig> ulvophyceae diversity. raxml tree displaying  <dig> tufa sequences of the order bryopsidales and ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’ based on an alignment of 891 bp. the tree was rooted with few outgroup taxa of the chlorophyta and edited in itol for bootstrap support, molecular species, and sequencing method . otu abundance color-coded for high read counts , moderate  and low . congruent clusters of molecular species between abgd and gmyc are represented in alternating dark and light grey colors. incongruent species boundaries are displayed in alternating colors yellow and red. taxonomy is reported on the tree margin. note important incongruence in molecular species delimitation between the two methods in the families caulerpaceae and halimedaceae

delimited species
the gmyc analysis delimited  <dig> hypothetical species in the ulvophyceae  while with abgd the output was  <dig> spp. species groups delimited by the two methods  represented 349– <dig> spp. in the bryopsidales, and 147– <dig> spp. in the ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’ . the majority of discrepancies arose in the bryopsidales in well-sampled families of the suborder halimedineae , namely in the halimedaceae  and especially in the rapidly diversifying caulerpaceae , where gmyc seemed to overlump and abgd oversplit terminal clades. by contrast, species delimitation showed greater congruence between the two methods in the remainder of the ulvophyceae, in the ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’  and in the bryopsidales within the suborders bryopsidineae  and ostreobidineae . the remote ostreobium clade found in the halimedineae, i.e. the ‘pseudostreobiaceae’, harbors 13– <dig> spp. molecular species divergence computed over the metabarcode length  indicated species boundaries lying between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % with the gmyc method , and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % with abgd  .

identity threshold for annotation
examination of taxonomic rank divergence obtained with sppdist within the ulvophyceae  indicated conservative annotation thresholds for family, suborder and order boundaries at  <dig>   <dig> and 79 %, respectively  and relaxed annotation thresholds at  <dig>   <dig>  77 %, respectively  . for the full breadth of phototrophic otus, conservative annotation thresholds for class, phylum and domain boundaries laid at  <dig>   <dig> and 82 %, respectively , while relaxed annotation thresholds laid at  <dig>   <dig> and 77 %, respectively  . overall, phototrophic otus matched the database at high identity levels with the majority of hits ≥84 %  in the range of class annotation . for the ulvophyceae, the majority of hits were ≥87 %  in the range of family-level thresholds . the most abundant otus, those driving abundance profiles , hit the database at even higher identity values  and displayed the same distribution for the phototrophs  or the ulvophyceae-only .fig.  <dig> conservative annotation thresholds. overall intra- and inter-molecular divergence  at the domain, phylum and class levels for all phototrophs and at the ordinal, subordinal and family levels within the ulvophyceae . percent identity values were computed based on an alignment of 375 bp of the tufa metabarcode. minimum conservative thresholds for metabarcode classification/annotation are printed. pi percent identity

discussion

following demultiplexing, we noted important read losses   probably caused by the systematic exclusion of reads containing base pair error within their index in the early steps of the uparse pipeline . here, demultiplexing losses may have also been exarcerbated by the length of our amplicon  for the chemistry used  since paired-ends could not overlap over the index regions. an additional consequence of potential increased substitution errors in the index region along with tag jumping in illumina-based metabarcoding  <cit> , is the misassignment of sequence-to-sample , which may inflate otu diversity across samples and thus bias richness profiles. however, since index error/jumping generally concerns only a small proportion of reads, false assignment is less likely to bias abundance profiles , especially when those profiles are underlayed by very abundant otus such as shown here . although we noted some possible tag error/jumping in otus retrieved in the deeply sequenced microfloras fl <dig> and jp <dig> , numerous unique otus were also found in each of these samples , . if there is any bias, we suspect that the richness profile reported for the ulvophyceae  was the most affected since this class included otus found in very large proportion of reads that were more likely to propagate  to other samples via tag error/jump. hence, in this regard, abundance profiles are in our opinion a much more robust depiction of otus actually present in a given sample.

currently, tag-jumps represent a non-negligible issue of the metabarcoding approach. indeed, esling et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that libraries prepared with single index primers  and saturated double index primers result in undetectable read cross-contamination. this is particularly problematic when presence-absence of otus  is critical for the outcome of a particular study . to mitigate cross-contamination, these authors showed that multiplexing samples following latin square designs can optimize mistag detection. recently, kitson et al.  <cit>  also reported on the development of nested metabarcode tagging  that apparently lead to accurate sample/index tracking. sequencing depth and evenness of the community found within a sample are also non-trivial issues affecting community profiles  obtained via metabarcoding. on the one hand, samples sequenced evenly  may not show all diversity present for samples that are strongly dominated by a few taxa ‘masking’ low abundance otus  <cit> . on the other hand, samples sequenced unevenly  may falsely exhibit higher diversity simply because they were sequenced at greater depth, which promotes biodiversity recovery  <cit> . in spite of these concerns, we are confident that our deeply sequenced samples jp <dig> and fl <dig> truly harbor more diversity than fl <dig> and gm <dig>  especially considering the dense endolithic colonization observed for these samples, and that the preparation of jp <dig> consisted in pooling subsamples of microfloras from multiple locations across the ryukyus archipelago to specifically maximize biodiversity recovery . to further support the above, we subsampled jp <dig> and fl <dig> to a shallow sequencing depth of  <dig>  reads as reported for fl <dig> and gm <dig> . following otu clustering , we observed a ~2– <dig> fold higher diversity for jp <dig> and fl <dig> than for fl <dig> and gm <dig>  namely  <dig> and  <dig> otus vs.  <dig> and  <dig> otus, respectively. we nonetheless recognize that sequencing fl <dig> and gm <dig> deeper could have retrieved some additional otu diversity.

overall, sequencing future projects with the now available 2 × 300 bp chemistries should greatly improve upon demultiplexing issues caused by index errors. in spite of the noted important read losses, our data set contained very high read redundancy and still comprised important sequencing noise  and thus included much sufficient data to assess our microfloras’ diversity. using a combination of superior algorithms with different de novo clustering strategies  such as uparse’s global and swarm’s local threshold algorithms, allowed us to filter for high quality core otus produced by both pipelines. as a result of this dual-clustering approach, our otus are very close to biological sequences , in congruence with the ≤1 % error rate reported on a mock community for uparse alone  <cit> . overall, the phylogenetic breadth documented by our de novo otus , added to the negligible proportion of identified contaminants , together demonstrate the specificity of our newly designed degenerate primers to target tufa from phototrophs that represented the majority of retrieved otus  and mapped reads  . the priming region of env_tufaf  actually overlaps with an extended stretch of codon insertion/deletions in numerous heterotrophs, which may further favor annealing, and therefore amplification, toward phototrophic diversity. for samples with very low phototroph content and/or containing inhibitors , target capture via hybridization with tufa probes may provide a valuable alternative to amplification, as well as enhance rare otus detection limits. some studies have performed target capture metabarcoding, such as for instance patel et al.  <cit> , denonfoux et al.  <cit>  and more recently dowle et al.  <cit> .

endolithic ulvophyceae
the molecular diversity and phylogenetic breadth of the boring microsiphons referred to as ostreobium spp. had clearly been overlooked in the literature and lacked tufa referencing . we document for this form genus an impressive polyphyletic cryptic diversity encompassing an estimated 85– <dig> species-level entities , for which we delimited five provisional families to facilitate the profiling of endolithic communities . these families exhibit molecular divergence comparable to conspicuous bryopsidalean families that are well circumscribed morphologically . our phylogeny also reveals unresolved branches at the base of the ‘maedaceae’  , which pending further sampling, may lead to the delimitation of additional families. in this endeavor, clarifying the molecular identity of the generitype o.quecketti  <cit>  from its type locality  should allow recircumscription of the family ostreobiaceae p.c. silva  toward establishing a more stable classification. we expect that sequencing of endolithic communities worldwide will further increase species diversity of euendolithic microsiphons. finally, although field collections were focused on ‘ostreobium’ spp., our assessment also recovered common euendolithic microfilamentous genera of the ‘ulvales-ulothrichales’, namely the phaeophilaceae and ulvellaceae, in culture and from cloning and metabarcoding .

database performance
thorough analyses of our newly established database resources for tufa permitted referencing the taxonomy of otus based on their phylogenetic position, as well as defining identity thresholds for their rapid annotation in the context of environmental biomonitoring studies via metabarcoding. although the backbone of our phototroph tree was overall poorly resolved , topological relationships obtained among phyla/classes with tufa were congruent with currently accepted hypotheses of chloroplasts/rhodoplasts and secondary endosymbiotic lineages evolution  <cit> , allowing visualization of the database and otus in a phylogenetically sound framework . relying on our divergence analyses, we were able to establish in silico  and clade-based  thresholds for otu annotation at high taxonomy levels  and lower taxonomy levels in the ulvophyceae  and order 77–79 %, figs.  <dig>  11). the fact that high-level taxonomy thresholds exceeded lower-level ones  reflects the combination of group-specific differences in tufa’s evolutionary rate , low biodiversity sampling in some clades, taxonomic discrepancies, and poorly resolved relationships . overall, our database achieved matching of otus at high identity values , which as a single threshold holds the potential to accurately annotate otus to both family  and class-levels . here, the majority of hits below 85 % belonged to the class cyanophyceae , which as the sole representative in the phylum cyanophyta  may thus be annotated with identity thresholds of 82 % , and eventually further relaxed down to 77 % . overall, we recommend applying a range of thresholds  and investigate with tree methods the phylogenetic position of otus that may cause profile disparities in order to correct their taxonomy. as demonstrated in the present study, our 375 bp metabarcode packs sufficient phylogenetic signal for model-based tree estimation when included in well-sampled sequence alignments . finally, matches in the 97–99 % range could be used for molecular species annotation in the ulvophyceae , providing that profiling at this level becomes necessary and that a molecular-based taxonomy becomes available for this cryptic diversity .

community profile
in spite of a possible, minimal bias in richness profile introduced via tag error/jump, the profiling of the microfloras revealed a core assemblage of phyla, classes and some ulvophycean families inhabiting endolithic communities, whose abundance varies, but appears universal . similarities in the phyla/classes richness and abundance profiles of the otu-rich coral reef samples fl <dig> and jp <dig> are interesting considering their distant geographic origin  and the fact that for the preparation of jp <dig>  multiple caco <dig> samples collected from across the ryukyu archipelago had been pooled together to maximize the recovery of endolithic biodiversity . in this regard, jp <dig> assemblage may thus be viewed as an average phyla/classes profile for shallow coral reefs of the ryukyus , whose applicability to other tropical areas such as in the atlantic  would appear relevant. by contrast with these two samples, the skewed profiles of the less densely colonized microfloras fl <dig> and gm <dig> may reflect immature or developing communities undergoing succession following for example, recent niche opening or disturbance. the rhodolith microflora of gm <dig> was particularly rhodophyta-rich from an abundant crust-forming rhizophyllis sp. otu  and an early branching otu that we could not presently resolve within the phylum . although we were careful to sample caco <dig> patches devoid of conspicuous encrusting red algae for the preparation of the microfloras’ dna extracts, we cannot exclude that accidental drilling of rhizophyllis   could account for these reads rather than propagules of this taxon present endolithically. likewise, the most abundant rhodophyta in other microflora samples were also encrusting taxa, the families ‘corallinaceae-hapalidiaceae’ and peyssonneliaceae , but other non-encrusting taxa were also present . lastly, gm <dig> also exhibited a lower phototroph/heterotroph ratio than other microfloras , which may be explained by its depth of collection in the mesophotic zone  where light availability may limit photosynthesis and algal caco <dig> penetration more importantly than in shallow waters.

evolutionary perspectives
our barcoding approach coupled with metabarcoding brought to light the widespread use of the endolithic niche as a habitat by the bryopsidales . for instance, several macroscopic taxa of the bryopsidineae  and the halimedineae  are present and may occupy the substratum in the form of germlings, reproductive cells, and endolithic siphonous/microsiphonous networks, the latter possibly used for lateral vegetative dispersal, thallus regeneration and access to nutrient-rich sediment trapped in cavities. overall, the bryopsidales seem to present a tight evolutionary link with the endolithic niche as an ancestral habitat, as evidenced by the early branching of the ostreobidineae in multi-marker studies  <cit> , also supported here with tufa . we hypothesize that environmental constraints associated with the epilithic niche such as high light/uv, direct water flow, and macroscopic predators  may have sparked the diversification of morphologically complex and conspicuous families from ancestral microsiphons living at the interface between the water column and the endolithic niche. in epilithic families able to exploit the endolithic niche with networks of siphons, this feature may thus represent a symplesiomorphy for some  and a possibly re-acquired trait for others  as suggested from the long branches leading to such lineage  . aside from the bryopsidales, the phylogenetic extent of phototrophic otus also found in the endolithic niche seemingly in the form of chaesmo- and cryptoendolithic reproductive cells or germlings, perennial boring euendoliths  as well as transient ones stages , highlights the critical importance of the caco <dig> substratum in algal evolution as a seedbank for life cycle completion and survival of diverse algal taxa  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we provide a flexible and comprehensive metabarcoding framework including primers, reference data and annotation thresholds for the facilitated recovery and rapid profiling of phototrophs found in endolithic communities. as a new resource for environmental biomonitoring, the framework is timely to enable the use of high throughput sequencing to accelerate biodiversity characterization of microbial/algal assemblages from endolithic communities found in coral reef and rhodolith ecosystems in the context of global change studies , holobiont functioning and anthropogenic degradation . our framework could also find useful applications for water quality studies related to public health, such as the monitoring of river eutrophication based on the diatom index  and the detection of toxic cyanobacteria  in freshwater and coastal systems  <cit>  pending further curation and increase in reference data for these particular groups, which our primers retrieved very efficiently. overall, tufa metabarcoding assays could be performed on numerous types of samples harboring algal phototrophs including for instance water column, biofilms, periphyton, soil and ice samples and herbivorous organisms . further studies of endolithic communities in coral reef and rhodolith ecosystems may reveal potential bioindicators of ecosystem degradation , whose efficient monitoring and detection may allow better management and conservation practices.
