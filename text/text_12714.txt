BACKGROUND
barramundi , also called asian seabass or the giant sea perch, belonging to the family latidae is widely distributed in the coast and freshwater of the tropical indo-west pacific, from the persian gulf to india and northern australia  <cit> . because of good meat quality and relatively high market value of l. calcarifer, it has become an attractive commodity of both large and small-scale aquaculture enterprises. it is commercially cultivated in thailand, malaysia, singapore, indonesia, hong kong, china and australia in both brackishwater and freshwater ponds, as well as in cages in coastal waters. the global annual production of l. calcarifer was  <dig>  mt according to fao statistics. however, detailed breeding programs for genetic improvement of asian seabass are still quite rare  <cit> . identification of genomic regions and genes responsible for economically important traits could facilitate genetic improvement through marker-assisted selection  <cit> , which is of importance for future aquaculture of l. calcarifer.

linkage and physical maps are indispensable tools needed to identify genomic regions responsible for traits of interest. the genome of l. calcarifer is very compact  consisting of  <dig> chromosome pairs  <cit> . the first linkage map for l. calcarifer containing  <dig> microsatellite markers and genes on  <dig> linkage groups  <cit>  was applied to mapping qtl for growth traits  <cit> . libraries with large genomic dna inserts are essential for physical mapping and positional cloning, particularly for higher eukaryotes  <cit> . the bac  cloning system has become an invaluable tool in genomics studies because of its ability to stably maintain large dna fragments and its ease of manipulation  <cit> . genomic inserts in bac clones have been shown to be very stable in e. coli and thus serve as ideal templates in generating whole-genome physical maps by dna fingerprinting, developing sequence-tagged connectors and shotgun sequencing  <cit> . these features make the bac cloning system a popular choice for high-throughput genomics studies  <cit> . bac libraries have been developed for many economically important animal species such as cattle  <cit> , pig  <cit> , and sheep  <cit>  and the highly endangered giant panda  <cit> . only currently, bac libraries were produced for some commercially important fish species such as salmon  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , rainbow trout, carp and tilapia  <cit> .

here, we describe the construction and characterization of a bac library covering  <dig>  times l. calcarifer haploid genome and mapping of  <dig> bac clones to the linkage map. the bac library and the improved linkage map of l. calcarifer will facilitate the integration of physical and linkage maps, fine mapping of qtl and identification of genes located in qtl of interest, maker-assisted selection and genome research.

RESULTS
library construction
a bac library of l. calcarifer was constructed using the hindiii cloning site in commercially prepared pcc1bac vector . the bac library consisted of a total of  <dig>  clones, which were manually arrayed into  <dig> 384-well plates.

insert size distribution
to examine the quality of the bac library, the sizes of  <dig> bac clones randomly picked from the library were determined. all the  <dig> clones contained inserts. the insert size distribution of these  <dig> clones is shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the average insert size was  <dig> kb, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. the insert size of over 80% of the bac clones in this library was larger than  <dig> kb, and the insert size of 50% clones was smaller than  <dig> kb. this bac library provides  <dig>  time haploid genome equivalent based on a genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> .

bac library screening
to further assess the quality of this bac library,  <dig> microsatellite markers randomly selected from each of the  <dig> linkage groups were used for hierarchical screening. pcr-screenings with the  <dig> microsatellite markers resulted in the number of positive clones varying from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>   . pcr screening with these  <dig> ests/genes  revealed that the number of positive bac clones varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  . the actual average number of positive bac clones detected by screening with microsatellites and ests/genes was near to theoretically calculated number of genome coverage . at least  <dig> positive bac clones for each of the ests/genes were identified from the library.

microsatellite isolation from bac clones and linkage mapping
in order to map bac clones to the linkage map for future integrating linkage and physical maps, we isolated microsatellites from  <dig> bac clones through enrichment of microsatellites.  <dig> clones collected from the microsatellite-enriched library were sequenced in both directions.  <dig> clones contained microsatellites , yielding  <dig> unique sequences containing microsatellites. among the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> had enough flanking regions for primer design. primers were designed for  <dig> microsatellites, among which  <dig> within  <dig> bac clones were informative in the mapping panel used for linkage mapping.  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> lg  while one marker lcab <dig> remained unlinked, making the total number of mapped markers on the l. calcarifer linkage map to be  <dig>  at least one bac based marker was mapped on each lg. thus, together with  <dig> microsatellites located in different bac clones and used for screening the bac library, a total of  <dig> bac based markers have been anchored on the linkage map with at least one on each lg. the male maps of lg <dig> and lg <dig>  which were split to two lg on the first generation map respectively  <cit>  due to the limited number of markers, were merged to one lg respectively by integrating new microsatellites located in single bac clones . details about primer sequences, genbank accession number, annealing temperature for pcr, pcr product size and locations of the  <dig> markers located in different bac clones are summarized in table  <dig>

discussion
a critical tool for genomic studies in fish species is the availability of deep-coverage large-insert genomic libraries, such as bac libraries that can be used for physical mapping, integration of linkage and physical maps, positional cloning, comparative genomic studies and genome sequencing  <cit> . we constructed the first bac library for l. calcarifer containing  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, indicating that this bac library provided  <dig>  × coverage of the l. calcarifer haploid genome. we have noticed that 50% of the inserts in our bac library were under  <dig> kb. it is common that insert size of 50% of bac clones was smaller than the size of dna fragments recovered from gels. this phenomenon has been seen in several bac libraries, such as the bac library of tomato  <cit> . the reason for this is that smaller fragments could be included in larger fragments during electrophoresis, and during ligation, the relatively smaller fragments were preferentially ligated to the vectors. pcr screening of the library with  <dig> markers each from one of  <dig> lg and  <dig> randomly selected ests/genes demonstrated that the bac library provided good coverage of the l. calcarifer genome. whether the bac clones with large inserts were of hybrid origin remains to be examined.

a second generation linkage map of l. calcarifer is under construction by integrating new markers including microsatellites, ests and candidate genes onto the first generation map. low polymorphism of ests and candidate genes was a bottleneck to map them to the linkage map  <cit> . using highly polymorphic microsatellites located in bac clones harboring interesting genes and ests, these interesting genes and ests could be mapped onto the linkage map as shown in this experiment. by employing highly polymorphic microsatellites in bac clones, we have mapped  <dig> bac clones to the linkage map of l. calcarifer. at least one bac clone has been anchored on each lg, which can be used to integrate linkage and physical maps in the future. the number of markers on the linkage map of l. calcarifer increased to  <dig> by mapping  <dig> novel microsatellites located in  <dig> bac clones onto the map. the two male linkage groups  which were split to two lg on the first generation map respectively  <cit>  due to the limited number of markers on these lg, were merged to one lg respectively by integrating new microsatellites located in single bac clones, which improved the quality of the linkage map of l. calcarifer.

the bac library of l. calcarifer could be also used in constructing a physical map by bac fingerprinting  <cit> , sequencing bac ends and positional cloning of qtl of commercial interests  <cit>  so as to facilitate selective breeding of l. calcarifer. eventually, the bac library can be used in whole genome shotgun sequencing when it becomes necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
a first l. calcarifer bac library with  <dig>  × coverage of the haploid genome has been constructed and characterized. screening the library with  <dig> markers and  <dig> ests/genes demonstrated good genome coverage of this library. eighty-six bac clones were mapped to the first generation linkage map, improving the marker density of the linkage map of l. calcarifer. this bac library together with the improved linkage map not only supplies an indispensable tool to physical mapping, integration of physical and linkage maps, and positional cloning for genes of importance, but also contributes to comparative genomic studies and eventually genome sequencing.
