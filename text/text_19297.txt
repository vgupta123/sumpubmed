BACKGROUND
alternative splicing of pre-mrnas is a powerful regulatory mechanism that can increase mrna transcript variety and effect functional diversification of proteins  <cit> . within the cardiovascular system, alternative splicing affects cardiac function by regulating proteins involved in cellular excitation, including ion channels  <cit> .

calcium-activated chloride currents have been recorded in cardiac muscle cells from various species including mouse  <cit> , and play an important role in the cardiac action potential  <cit> . in  <dig>  three independent groups identified tmem16a as a strong candidate gene to encode  a calcium-activated chloride channel  <cit> . tmem16a belongs to a family of ten mammalian paralogs ) that are highly conserved membrane spanning proteins. in recombinant expression systems, tmem16a  and tmem16b  generate calcium-activated chloride currents  <cit>  with similar biophysical and pharmacological properties to currents recorded from native tissues  <cit> . we and others have identified tmem16a expression in mouse and human heart  <cit> .

the human tmem16a gene exhibits three alternatively spliced exons  as well as an alternative transcription start site  <cit> . ferrera et al. reported that the biophysical properties of human tmem16a are regulated by alternative splicing and tmem16a splice variants form functional channels that display different properties  <cit> . the alternative exon 6b  may play an important role in the regulation of the tmem16a channel by calcium, since exclusion of this exon increases the calcium sensitivity of the channel ~ 4-fold  <cit> . exon  <dig>  encoding  <dig> amino acids, contributes significantly to tmem16a channel kinetics, since exclusion of this exon significantly reduces the voltage dependence of activation  <cit> . a recent study showed that exon  <dig>  exclusion results in significantly faster activation and deactivation kinetics  <cit> . in addition, mazzone et al, showed significant differences in expression of alternatively spliced tmem16a exons in patients with diabetic gastroparesis when compared to non-diabetic controls  <cit> . therefore, it appears that alternative splicing of human tmem16a plays an important role in the regulation of calcium-activated chloride channel function.

the reported mouse tmem16a gene  is composed of  <dig> exons that code for a  <dig> amino acid protein . unlike human, mouse tmem16a, as annotated, does not contain alternative exons 6b,  <dig> or  <dig>  we and others however, have reported that tmem16a transcripts containing these alternative exons are expressed in mouse stomach, intestine  <cit>  and vascular  <cit>  smooth muscle tissues. it is likely that alternative splicing of tmem16a transcript in mouse may lead to a number of different tmem16a channel proteins with altered biophysical properties similar to human tmem16a  <cit> . in this study our aim was to provide detailed information of the structure of the mouse tmem16a gene and to investigate if tmem16a transcript undergoes alternative splicing to generate channel diversity in mouse heart. this study demonstrates that the structure of tmem16a gene is significantly more complex than previously indicated. the complexity is especially evident in the region containing exons  <dig> through  <dig>  determining the variation of tmem16a transcript expression in heart is an important foundation for future studies of the physiological role of tmem16a channels in heart.

methods
rna isolation and rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from mouse tissues using trizol reagent . human heart rna was purchased from agilent technologies . first-strand cdna was prepared from  <dig> μg of rna using oligo primer and superscript ii reverse transcriptase . amplitaq gold® pcr reagent  was used to amplify each of the tmem <dig> paralogs and tmem16a splice variants. pcr primers were designed using the mouse and human tmem16a mrna sequences . details of the primer sets used are provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> and table s2). glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was used as a control for cdna integrity. no template pcr reactions served as controls for primer contamination. pcrs were performed in a  <dig> thermal cycler . amplification consisted of 95°c for  <dig> min, then  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec, ta for  <dig> sec and 72°c for 30- <dig> sec, followed by a final step at 72°c for  <dig> min.

splice variant identification, sequencing and bioinformatics
pcr products were resolved on 2-3% super fine agarose  gels along with a  <dig> bp molecular weight marker. tmem16a amplification products were either purified  or ta cloned into the pcdna <dig>  vector . all fragment sequencing was performed at the nevada genomics center. nucleotide and protein sequences were analyzed using vector nti version  <dig> software  and blastn software at the national center for biotechnology information  database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/.

transmembrane regions were predicted using the cbs tmhmm server v  <dig>  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/ and tmpred http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmpred_form.html programs. the tandem splice site database  http://gen <dig> imb-jena.de/tassdb2/ was used to confirm alternative tandem splice sites in mouse and human tmem16a. the scansite database http://scansite.mit.edu/motifscan_id.phtml was used to identify motifs in the tmem16a alternative splice variants.

RESULTS
tmem16a genomic structure is highly conserved in mouse and human
genomic sequences for human  tmem16a were compared with their respective rna sequence . the reported mouse tmem16a gene is composed of  <dig> exons, however, our analysis has revealed that mouse tmem16a gene consists of at least  <dig> exons, ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. table  <dig> provides details of mouse tmem16a gene structure, including the number of exons, exon and intron size, 5' donor and 3'acceptor splice site sequences. the exon sizes of human tmem16a are also provided for comparison purposes. the exon-intron junctions of tmem16a comply with the consensus dinucleotide gt-ag rule. the number and size of each exon in mouse tmem16a gene are highly conserved with human tmem16a. there is some divergence between mouse and human tmem16a genes at the 5' and 3' termini. for example, in mouse, exon  <dig> and exon 1b differ from human. the putative translational initiation codon of mouse and human tmem16a are located in exon 1b and exon  <dig> respectively. the nucleotides adjacent to the initiator codons , constitute a favorable kozak consensus initiation site  <cit> . human tmem16a has been reported to exhibit alternative splicing  <cit> . this study indicates that tmem16a in mouse also exhibits multiple alternative exons, which generates numerous isoforms through alternative splicing of the primary transcript. a close examination of the mouse tmem16a genomic sequence revealed that similar sequences to these human exon variants  could be identified . additionally, a number of novel splicing events were identified  and the details of these transcript variants are outlined throughout this report.

intron size refers to the intron following the exon listed in each row.

identification of tmem16a splice variant expression in mouse heart
rt-pcr was initially used to identify the expression of tmem <dig> paralogs in mouse heart using primers specific for each of the tmem <dig> family members . in addition to tmem16a, several other tmem <dig> transcripts were detected in mouse heart: tmem16c, d, e, f, h, j and k . the expression of tmem16b and tmem16g transcripts were not detected. to determine if alternative exons, homologous to the exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> of human tmem16a  <cit> , are also expressed in mouse heart we performed rt-pcr analysis of tmem16a . primer sets ± exon 6b, ± exon  <dig> and ± exon  <dig> amplify fragments that differ in size  corresponding to the size of the alternative exon. the amplification of two fragments using ± exon 6b and ± exon  <dig> primers clearly indicates that tmem16a variants that either include or exclude these alternative exons are expressed in mouse heart . the presence or absence of the alternative  <dig> bp micro-exon  <dig> is difficult to resolve by gel electrophoresis, therefore additional primers were designed that either hybridize within each of the alternative exons to specifically amplify them or that span bordering exons to exclude them . for example, tmem16a transcripts lacking exon  <dig>  were selectively amplified using a primer that spans the junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  similarly, tmem16a transcripts containing exon  <dig>  were specifically amplified using a primer internal to exon  <dig>  rt-pcr gel analysis  and fragment sequencing confirmed that tmem16a variants are expressed in mouse heart that either exclude or include exon 6b, exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  identical to those we identified in mouse gastrointestinal tissues  <cit> .

a comparison of the amino acid sequences of mouse and human alternative exons show a high similarity; the four amino acids  of exon  <dig> are 100% identical, the  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids encoded by exon 6b and exon  <dig>  share  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively. considering the high percentage amino acid identity of these exon between the two species, we can expect that the regulatory properties attributed to these channel domains in human  <cit> , will most likely confer similar functional roles in the mouse, in that, exon 6b may confer calcium sensitivity, exon  <dig> may contribute to voltage dependence and exon  <dig> may play a role in the activation and deactivation kinetics of this calcium activated chloride channel. the inclusion of alternative exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> would result in additional amino acids in intracellular channel domains and are not predicted to alter the eight transmembrane topology of the tmem16a protein.

tmem16a transcripts with combinations of alternative exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> create diversity
a detailed investigation into the expression of various alternative exon combinations has not been reported for tmem16a. to explore if different combinations of these alternative exons exist in mouse and human heart, we employed rt-pcr analysis to examine the region of the tmem16a transcript encompassing alternative exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> . eight tmem16a variants may be generated due to alternative combinations of exon inclusion or exclusion . rt-pcr analysis generated tmem16a transcripts of various molecular sizes expressed in mouse and human heart , corresponding to different combinations of tmem16a alternative exon 6b,  <dig> or  <dig> inclusion or exclusion. the complexity of alternative exon combinations is difficult to resolve by size analysis alone, largely due to the micro exon  <dig> and two possible fragments of the same size . thus, the entire rt-pcr amplifications were cloned, and sequence analysis of multiple clones confirmed that at least six distinct tmem16a splice variants consisting of various combinations of exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> are expressed in mouse and human heart.

both mouse and human heart express the following three exon combinations: tmem16a , tmem16a , and tmem16a . we did not identify tmem16a transcripts consisting of exon 6b alone  or a tmem16a variant containing 6b and  <dig> but lacking exon  <dig>  in either mouse or human heart. it appears, at least in heart, that exon 6b is only expressed in the presence of exon  <dig>  however, we did identify tmem16a transcripts containing exon  <dig> in the absence of both exons 6b and  <dig>  in mouse heart. interestingly, a tmem16a transcript missing all three exons  was only identified in mouse heart, in agreement with the reported tmem16a  and although a human transcript variant  <dig>   exists we did not confirm its presence in human heart. all human tmem16a transcripts contained exon  <dig>  in agreement with  . the largest tmem16a variant consisting of all three exons was confirmed by sequence analysis in human heart. although this tmem16a variant was not confirmed in our screening of mouse heart clones, we cannot rule out its existence since our gel analysis indicates a band close to the expected size of this variant, albeit much weaker than in human . indeed, it is possible that different mouse and human tissues may express different combinations of these alternative exons, however, quantification of our data would not provide more information since the tissues examined in this study contain a mixed population of cells. the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse tmem16a containing alternative exons combinations  all read in-frame, indicating that these alternative exons are additional channel components similar to those of human tmem16a  <cit> . blastn searches of dbest and refseq rna databases identified a number of mouse ests containing exon 6b and exon  <dig>  indeed, one mouse est  was identified for the +6b, + <dig>  - <dig> exon combination. est supporting query sequences were identified for mouse  containing exon  <dig> alone . no ests were found in mouse containing both exon  <dig> and  <dig>  however this is the exon combination in human that corresponds to tmem16a .

in addition to alternative exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig>  we also identified a number of novel tmem16a splicing events in mouse and human heart; exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> exclusion, the inclusion of a novel exon, and two intron retention events.

novel tmem16a transcripts with exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> exclusion
we identified two previously unreported tmem16a exon skipping events, exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  in mouse and human heart . exclusion of exon  <dig>  in tmem16a rna would result in an in-frame deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the channel protein. exon  <dig> encodes a hydrophobic region predicted to be the first transmembrane spanning domain of tmem16a. therefore, exon  <dig> exclusion would result in a change in the transmembrane topology. we identified through sequencing two different tmem16a  transcripts, in that both transcripts lacked exon 6b and included exon  <dig>  however, they differed in whether or not exon  <dig> was included. this is highlighted in the cartoon in figure 3a. we employed an additional primer set to specifically amplify tmem16a  variants  and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of these transcript variants in mouse and human heart.

sequence analysis revealed that the tmem16a  variant included exons 6b and  <dig> and excluded exon  <dig> . exclusion of exon  <dig>  in tmem16a rna would result in an in-frame deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the first intracellular loop of the tmem16a channel. a pkc site is present in exon  <dig> at position s <dig>  and one could speculate that tmem16a transcripts lacking exon  <dig> may encode channels that differ in modulation by pkc. likewise, the expression of this variant was confirmed in mouse and human heart using primers which specifically amplify tmem16a  variants.

tmem16a transcripts with a novel conserved exon 13b
sequence screening of our tmem16a clone library, identified an unusual tmem16a transcript that excluded alternative exons 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> yet contained an additional  <dig> nucleotides between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  evaluation of tmem16a genomic sequence revealed that these  <dig> nucleotides are located within the  <dig> bp intronic region between exon  <dig> and  <dig>  and are bordered by conserved 'gt-ag' acceptor and donor splice sites  <cit> . we assigned the additional sequence in this tmem16a transcript as exon 13b. a close examination of the intronic sequence immediately upstream of exon 13b identified a conserved mammalian "curay" branchpoint sequence  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site . the branchpoint  is generally situated  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site and plays an important role in identifying this splice site  <cit> . an adjacent polypyrimidine tract, which increases the efficiency of branchpoint utilization  <cit> , was also identified in this region . together, these findings add support that this  <dig> bp sequence is a true exon. inclusion of exon 13b in the tmem16a transcript would result in an in-frame addition of  <dig> amino acids in tmem16a. this region is rich in hydrophobic leucine residues . it is not surprising then that hydropathy analysis suggests that exon 13b inclusion may constitute an additional domain in the tmem16a channel integral to the membrane.

considering that the exon structures of tmem16a are highly conserved amongst homologs, we investigated if similar novel exons could be identified in other species. a close examination of the genomic tmem16a sequence from rat, human and rhesus monkey  revealed that similar sequences to mouse tmem16a exon 13b, bordered by conserved splice sites could be identified. an alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence of these four species  demonstrates  <dig> % overall consensus with an identity of  <dig> %. specific primers designed to amplify this novel exon in human heart were unable to identify its expression. whether or not this exon is present in other human tissue types is unknown.

the expression of the novel exon 13b in mouse heart was investigated further using primer sets to specifically amplify the 5' and 3' regions surrounding the  <dig> bp exon . sequence analysis revealed some interesting observations. first, we confirmed that exon 13b is utilized in mouse heart. secondly, exon 13b is present in several tmem16a transcripts that differ in whether they also include or exclude alternative exons  <dig> or  <dig>  third, retention of the introns surrounding exon 13b increases the complexity of splicing in this region of tmem16a transcript. rt-pcr with the primer set 5'exon13b, in which primers bind within exon  <dig> and 13b produced two amplification products . sequencing analysis indicated one tmem16a fragment consisted of exons  <dig>   <dig> and 13b and the other fragment consisted of exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  13b plus the entire  <dig> bp intronic sequence between exon  <dig> and 13b . the 3'exon13b primer set, in which the primers hybridize across exon 12/13b junction and within exon  <dig>  yielded three tmem16a transcript fragments . two fragments differ in exon  <dig> inclusion/exclusion exons  <dig>  13b,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <dig>  and an unexpected fragment consisting of exon  <dig>  13b,  <dig>  - <dig>   <dig> plus the entire intronic sequence  between exon 13b and  <dig> . intron retention events at the 5' and 3' of exon 13b are certainly the result of alternative tmem16a splicing and not genomic contamination since the 5'exon13b and 3'exon13b primers span at least  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb of genomic sequence, respectively.

the intron retention events at the 5'and 3' of exon 13b would introduce a premature stop codon in the tmem16a transcript, resulting in a truncated protein just after the "eavk" amino acids encoded by exon  <dig>  the complete retention of an intron in a mature transcript is one of the least expected forms of alternative splicing and may occur due to weak splice sites, cis-regulatory elements or short intron lengths  <cit> . indeed, the introns between exons  <dig> and 13b and between exon 13b and  <dig> are two of the shortest in the tmem16a genomic sequence . intron retention can result in the insertion of a premature stop codon being introduced to the mature transcript which may then be degraded by nonsense mediated decay  <cit> . indeed, decreasing the mrna levels of certain genes can be the purpose of alternative splicing  <cit> . however, sometimes the retention of an intron in the coding region can have a biological effect. for example, an intron retaining isoform of the kcnma <dig> gene, which encodes the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel , facilitates splice variant regulation which contributes to structural and functional diversity of bk channel proteins in hippocampal neurons  <cit> .

tmem16a transcript scanning assay reveals additional novel splice variants
it is clear from our analysis that tmem16a transcript undergoes extensive splicing within the region between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, not all of these exon inclusion/exclusion combinations are consistent between mouse and human. indeed splicing events occurring at other regions of tmem16a transcript may have important functional implications. thus, we profiled the entire tmem16a using overlapping rt-pcr primers to determine whether additional tmem16a rna splicing events occur in mouse and human heart. the transcript scanning assay and sequencing analysis revealed additional novel tmem16a variants. these variants included exon  <dig> exclusion in both mouse and human tmem16a and two alternative 3' donor sites, Δ3'exon  <dig> and Δ3'exon  <dig>  in mouse. details for mouse and human tmem16a are summarized in tables  <dig> and  <dig>

exon  <dig> is  <dig> nucleotides and the exclusion of this exon shifts the encoded mouse tmem16a out of frame at amino acid i <dig> , truncating the protein from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. exon  <dig> encodes the fifth transmembrane spanning domain of tmem16a  <cit>  and exclusion of exon  <dig> would result in a c-terminus truncated tmem16a protein containing four membrane spanning domains . translation of mouse tmem16a yields a protein of ~110kda. the exclusion of exon  <dig> in the mouse transcript could result in a truncated tmem16a protein of ~ <dig> - <dig> kda . interestingly, two independent studies have reported an additional signal on western blots for tmem16a  <cit>  which were much lower  than the expected  <dig> kda. from the results presented in this study, it is possible that the lower molecular weight band corresponds to an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a truncated tmem16a protein.

the Δ3'exon  <dig> and Δ3'exon  <dig> alternative donor sites are the result of wobble splicing occurring at donor splice sites located in close proximity, commonly known as tandem splice sites. alternative splicing at tandem splice sites occurs frequently in many species and can result in subtle variations in transcripts and the proteins that they encode  <cit> . use of the tmem16a Δ3'exon  <dig> splice site, results in the exclusion of the last  <dig> nucleotides  of exon  <dig>  the mouse tmem16a genomic sequence was queried against the tassdb database of alternative tandem splice sites  <cit> , and the Δ3'exon  <dig> was recognized as tandem splicing at donor splice site with the motif gyngyn. indeed, a blastn search of the est database revealed  <dig> ests without this 3' gtg and two ests that contained it. this alternative splice event is not expected to alter tmem16a protein since exon  <dig> is non-coding. skipping of exon  <dig> and part of exon  <dig> has been reported in human tmem16a  <cit> , however, ferrera et al failed to identify transcripts lacking this region  <cit>  and considered that its splicing may be under the control of an alternative promoter and influenced by certain physiological or pathophysiological conditions. indeed, a recent study showed that a novel tmem16a variant with an alternative 5' end is highly expressed in gastric smooth muscle of patients with diabetic gastroparesis compared with controls  <cit> . apart from Δ3'exon  <dig> tandem splice site, our study did not identify additional variation at the 5'end. the Δ3'exon  <dig> tandem splice site would result in  <dig> additional  nucleotides at the 3' end of exon  <dig>  this is predicted to shift the protein out of frame at amino acid m <dig> , resulting in a truncated tmem16a protein with an altered c-terminus of ~ <dig> kda. according to tassdb <dig>  <cit>  this tandem splice site is conserved in human, dog and chicken tmem16a sequence.

distribution of novel tmem16a alternative splice variants in other tissues
this study focused on identifying tmem16a splice variants in heart. we extended this analysis to investigate if these novel variants are expressed in other mouse tissues from which a calcium-activated chloride current can be recorded. initially, we confirmed tmem16a expression in mouse brain, lung, stomach , small intestine, colon, kidney and bladder tissues . all organs were dissected out with their attached vasculature. total rna obtained from each of these organs therefore contains a mixed population of cells. we then examined the expression of the following exons: +6b, - <dig>  + <dig>  +13b, - <dig>  + <dig> and - <dig>  the distribution of tmem16a alternative exon variants in these mouse tissues is summarized . in addition to heart, all of the tissues examined express the following variants; +6b, - <dig>  + <dig>  +13b and + <dig>  the - <dig> exon variant was only detected in heart, lung, small intestine and colon. the - <dig> exon variant was detected in all tissues examined apart from kidney. the molecular diversity of tmem16a may contribute to numerous proteomic variations of tmem16a channels that may fine-tune channel functions in specific tissue types.

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides details of tmem16a genomic organization and our analyses have detected previously unidentified alternative exons. we identified tmem16a transcript variants consisting of different exon usage events involving exons 6b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  many of these exons are expressed in various combinations. a number of other splicing events including a novel exon 13b, tandem splice sites of exon  <dig> and  <dig> and two intron retention events were also identified. the alternative splicing events indentified here indicate that a varied population of tmem16a channels is expressed in mouse heart and other tissues. the heart is a highly heterogeneous tissue composed of numerous cell types tailored for specialized function. it is possible that many tmem16a variants can be co-expressed in the same cells, or differentially distributed in distinct cell types within the myocardium. determining the localization of different tmem16a isoforms within tissues has important implications with regard to the function of tmem16a. the functional consequence of tmem16a channel diversity remains to be determined. we can speculate however, that tmem16a variants would create channels with altered biophysical properties, such as that reported for exon 6b,  <dig> and  <dig> in tmem16a  <cit> . it is also possible that regulation of the channels may be altered since several of these alternatively spliced exons contain phosphorylation sites and interacting domains, for example, pkc and camkii , pka , erk-d domain  and a src-sh <dig> domain . tmem16a channels have been shown to form homodimers  <cit> , therefore, it is likely that tmem16a variants may interact with each other to form functional channels in a similar manner to that reported for the herg family  <cit> . another possibility is that alternatively spliced isoforms may associate with additional accessory proteins. it is evident from this study that alternative splicing is an exquisite mechanism that operates to diversify tmem16a channel structures by the combinatorial selection of alternatively spliced events. future recombinant expression of different tmem16a variants will reveal their physiological role.
