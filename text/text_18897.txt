BACKGROUND
seed number is an important factor in crop yield. because seeds are derived from fertilized ovules, development of the floral organs, especially the gynoecium, which bears ovules, directly affects the final seed number. although environmental factors can modulate floral organ development, intrinsic mechanisms control the final size of the floral organs  <cit> .

after the meristematic primordium is established, organ growth can be divided into two phases: cell division followed by cell expansion . many genes, such as the transcription factors grfs/gifs and jagged, cytochrome p <dig> , ubiquitin receptor da <dig> and the e <dig> ubiquitin ligases da <dig> and bb, regulate cell proliferation rate or control the timing of proliferation arrest to maintain normal cell numbers and final organ size . other genes, such as the transcription factor bhlh and mediator complex subunit  <dig>  regulate the cell expansion rate to control the cell area, which affects organ size and shape  <cit> .

moreover, hormones, such as jasmonic acid, gibberellin, brassinosteroids, and cytokinin, have been reported to be involved in the regulatory network of organ size . auxin plays a very important role in floral organ size and development. auxin signals directly induce expression of the gene auxin-regulated gene involved in organ size , which further upregulates the downstream gene transcription factor aintegumenta   <cit> . over-expression of argos or ant can extend the period of cell division, resulting in larger leaves and floral organs with more seeds per silique in arabidopsis. conversely, mutation of argos or ant decreased the final organ size and seed number . in addition, small auxin up rna  was induced by auxin to promote cell elongation and final organ size  <cit> . several auxin response factors, which mediate the transcriptional response to auxin, regulate floral organ size and development. arf <dig> was reported to suppress petal cell proliferation, cell elongation and final petal size through interaction with the bhlh transcription factor  <cit> . arf <dig> could repress ant transcription to limit cell proliferation and organ size  <cit> . in addition to controlling floral organ size, auxin also regulates normal development of floral organs. in mutants defective in auxin biosynthesis and transport, the gynoecium is a thin and round stalk with diminished or no valve tissues of the ovary, indicating that auxin is necessary for the early establishment of carpel primordium  <cit> . mp  which, mediates auxin signalling, could control ovule primordial formation by regulating ant, cuc <dig> and cuc <dig> expression  <cit> .

mads-box genes are major players in floral organ differentiation and development. floral homeotic proteins from mikc-type mads-box genes form a combinatorial quaternary complex to control differentiation of the distinct floral organs, which was used to explain the principle of the abc e model  <cit> . in addition to floral organ identity, mikc-type mads-box genes also control floral organ size and shape by regulating cell division and expansion  <cit> . through chromatin immunoprecipitation , many growth regulatory genes were shown to be targets of mads-box transcription factors . for example, e class mads-box gene  could directly bind grf genes and jagged gene, which regulate cell division. in addition, mads-box transcription factors interact with other transcription factors, such as arf <dig> and spl <dig>  <cit> .

three mads-box transcription factor genes, apetala <dig> , fruitfull , and suppressor of constans overexpression  <dig> , were directly induced by mir156/157-targeted spls . by promoting ap <dig>  ful and soc <dig> expression, mir156/157-targeted spls could accelerate phase transition. different mir156/157-targeted osspls have been reported to regulate tiller and panicle architecture and grain size in rice . mir156s with highly similar mir157s are collectively referred to as mir156/ <dig> family. many studies have reported that mir156/ <dig> family could regulate root development, increase tolerance to heat or salt stress, and promote trichome distribution and shoot regenerative capacity . here, we identified another role of mir156/ <dig> family in the regulation of floral organ growth and ovule production through over-expression of a mir <dig> precursor in cotton. at least five mir156/157-targeted spls and two mads-box transcription factors, which are orthologs of atagl <dig> and sitdr <dig>  were down-regulated in the over-expression lines. meanwhile, auxin signalling was attenuated in the mir <dig> over-expression lines. we hypothesized that the mir157/spl axis may regulate mads-box transcription factors and affect auxin signal transduction, finally regulating floral organ growth and ovule production.

RESULTS
over-expression of ghmir <dig> in cotton reduced flower size and seed production and altered plant architecture
mir156/ <dig> family is one of the most conserved mirna families in the plant kingdom and has many functions in plant development  <cit> . through small rna sequencing, the ghmir156/ <dig> family was profiled in cotton .

to further analyse the function of ghmir156/ <dig> family in cotton, we selected a ghmir <dig> whose abundance is the highest in ghmir156/ <dig> family for analysis, and then we cloned a 372 bp genomic sequence containing a mir <dig> precursor from gossypium hirsutum  using the predicted reference sequence for gossypium raimondii  <cit> . to overexpress ghmir <dig>  we used the 35s promoter to drive the mir <dig> precursor and transferred the construct into yz <dig> . seven transformants were obtained , among which five showed dramatically increased mature mir <dig> expression levels . compared with the nontransgenic plants , the over-expression lines  showed a stronger vegetative growth vigor and produced more vegetable branches and leaves . however, the size of the opened flowers and bolls from over-expression lines was notably smaller . in addition, the numbers of ovules per ovary were significantly decreased in the over-expression lines compared with control, which further led to reduced seeds per boll in over-expression lines . therefore, we concluded that over-expressing ghmir <dig> altered plant architecture and reduced reproductive capacity sharply.fig.  <dig> over-expressing the ghmir <dig> precursor leads to smaller flowers and fewer seeds. a northern blot analysis of mature mir <dig> expression in floral buds.5s rna was used as the rna loading control. b images of opened flowers and  <dig> dpa bolls. c and d the number of ovules per ovary and seed numbers per boll. different letters indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . the error bars indicate the standard deviation of at least  <dig> biological replicates. e and f images of ovaries after removing the valves and mature bolls. ov <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines. control, nontransgenic plant segregated from 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines. wt, wild type 




over-expression of ghmir <dig> in cotton suppressed floral organ development
because the size of the opened flowers was significantly smaller in over-expression lines, we further compared the size of flower buds at different developmental stages among ov <dig>  ov <dig> and control . when the first-node flower on the first branch was open, we sampled first-node buds from the second branch  to the tenth branch  in order. thus, buds from different branches were at different developmental stages. the results showed that at very early emergence , the size of the flower buds had become smaller in ov <dig> and ov <dig>  kinematic analysis of petal size also showed that petal development was arrested in ov <dig> and ov <dig> after flower bud emergence . in addition to petals, the other floral organs, including the bract, sepal, stigma and stamen, were also examined. the areas of the bracts, sepals and petals from opened flowers were smaller in over-expression lines . the anther number and the stigma length were also smaller in over-expression lines . these data illustrated that the development of the four whorls of floral organs was suppressed in the over-expression lines. because the cell number and cell size are both determinant factors of the final organ size, the epidermal cells at the adaxial side of the mature petals were examined . the lower cell number and smaller cell size in the over-expression lines demonstrated that cell proliferation and expansion were suppressed in over-expression lines.fig.  <dig> over-expressing ghmir <dig> suppressed floral organ development. a image of developing floral buds from different fruit branches. b kinematic analysis of the developing petal area. c-f images of the petal , bract , stamen and gynoecium  and sepal  from opened flowers of control , ov <dig>  and ov <dig>  plants. g images of epidermal cells at the adaxial side of mature petals. scale bar, 100 μm. h and i the number of mature petal cells  and the mature petal cell area . b2-b <dig> represent the position of the developing floral buds from the second to tenth fruit branch. control, nontransgenic plant segregated from 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton. ov <dig> and ov <dig>  35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton. different letters indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . the error bars indicate the standard deviation of at least eight biological replicates

ectopic expression of a ghmir <dig> precursor in arabidopsis also arrested flower development
the mir156/ <dig> family is highly conserved in the plant kingdom  <cit> . to verify whether the function of mir <dig> in floral organ development is universal in other species, the ghmir <dig> precursor was ectopically expressed in arabidopsis. two successful ectopic expression lines  were analysed, and the transgenic lines showed high expression of the mirna <dig> precursor . compared to the wild type, e <dig> and e <dig> had more rosette leaves , and floral organ size, especially petals, was smaller in e <dig> and e <dig> . meanwhile, the shorter gynoecium contained fewer ovules in e <dig> and e <dig> . thus, ectopic expression of ghmir <dig> in arabidopsis almost reproduced the phenotype in cotton, which indicated that the function of the mir156/ <dig> family in floral organ development is conserved between cotton and arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> ectopic expression of the ghmir <dig> precursor in arabidopsis. a phenotypes of 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in arabidopsis. b and c phenotypes of flowers and gynoecium at stage  <dig>  scale bar , 100 μm. d relative expression of the ghmir <dig> precursor in inflorescences. “#”, indicates no expression. r.e.l., the relative expression levels calculated using atact <dig>  as a control. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of four biological replicates. e and f the number of ovules per ovary  and the petal area . different letters indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . the error bars  indicate the standard deviation of at least  <dig> biological replicates. e <dig> and e <dig> indicate 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in arabidopsis





over-expression of ghmir <dig> in cotton attenuated female fertility
because over-expressing ghmir <dig> arrested floral organ development, we assessed whether gamete fertility was affected. therefore, we first examined the seed set status among wild type, control and over-expression lines in the field. the seed set efficiency of the wild type and control was approximately 70%, but over-expression lines, except ov <dig>  had reduced efficiency, e.g.,  <dig> to 56% , indicating that gamete fertility was defective in the over-expression lines. to determine whether the female or male fertility was defective in over-expression lines, we then used wild type pollens to pollinate control and ov <dig> plants in the greenhouse. the seed set efficiency was approximately 87% in the control × wt plants but reduced to 64% in the ov12 × wt plants, demonstrating that female fertility was reduced in the over-expression lines . then  <dig> ,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was used to test pollen vigor, but there was no obvious difference between control and ov <dig> . thus, reduced female fertility, not male fertility, resulted in the decrease in seed set efficiency and the reduction of final seed number in over-expression lines.fig.  <dig> fertility test of 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines. a calculation of seed set efficiency . b image of pollen stained with  <dig> ,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. control, nontransgenic plant segregated from 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines. ov <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  independent 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines. wt, wild type . control × wt and ov12 × wt indicate the plants from control and ov <dig> were pollinated with wild type pollens in the greenhouse




rna-sequencing analysis of developing floral buds
to explore how over-expressing ghmir <dig> suppressed floral organ development, rna-sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes between the over-expression line  and control. because the size of the flower buds was different between control and ov <dig> at very early emergence, floral buds  were sampled for rna-sequencing analysis. approximately  <dig> million clean reads were generated from two biological repeat libraries of ov <dig> and control . more than 85% of all the clean reads could be mapped to the cotton genome  <cit> , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes were expressed in the libraries from the ov <dig> and control plants . furthermore,  <dig>  genes were expressed in all the libraries, and only  <dig> and  <dig> genes were specifically expressed in control and ov <dig>  respectively . the correlations of gene expression level between two biological repeats of ov <dig> and control were both more than  <dig> , which indicates that the biological repeats are credible . to screen differentially expressed genes between control and ov <dig>  we used the noiseq package  <cit> . genes were filtered based on following criteria: fold change ≥  <dig> and divergence probability ≥  <dig> . we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes, in which  <dig> genes were up-regulated in control, but only  <dig> genes were down-regulated in control . based on another method, the ebseq package  <cit> , the results also showed that more up-regulated genes were found in control than in ov <dig> .fig.  <dig> rna sequencing analysis of differentially expressed genes between control and 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic line. a venn diagram of co-expressed genes among samples. b analysis of the correlation between samples. c detection of differentially expressed genes between control and 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic line based on the noiseq method. yellow plots indicate up-regulated genes in control, blue plots indicate down-regulated genes in control, brown plots indicate no changed genes. d-m real-time pcr analysis of differentially expressed genes in floral buds. r.e.l., the relative expression levels calculated using histone <dig>  as a control. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of four biological replicates. different letters in the plots indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . n ghmir <dig> targets were identified using rlm-race. black arrows indicate the position of the target cleavage sites. the numbers next to the black arrows indicate the cleavage frequency. control, nontransgenic plant segregated from 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton. ov <dig> and ov <dig>  35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton




in the up-regulated genes of control, some are transcription factors, such as spl and mads-box genes. interestingly, all the differentially expressed spls have been predicted as targets of ghmir <dig>  but the abundance of non-mir157-targeted spls was not different between control and ov <dig> . there are  <dig> members of the spl family, which could be categorized into eight subgroups based on orthologous genes in arabidopsis, and five of eight subgroups could be predicted as targets of ghmir <dig> . five spls, which were selected from five subgroups, were further verified as ghmir <dig> targets using rlm-race . real-time pcr was performed to validate the abundance of these five spls. the results showed that compared to control, three spls  were significantly down-regulated in ov <dig> and ov <dig>  and the expression level of other spls  modestly decreased in ov <dig> and ov <dig> . these data demonstrated that ghmir157-targeted spls were generally down-regulated in over-expression lines.

mads-box transcription factor genes, such as atsoc <dig>  atap <dig> and atful, were shown to be directly up-regulated by spls in arabidopsis . our data showed that three mads-box transcription factors, gh_a11g <dig>  gh_d08g <dig> and gh_a11g <dig>  which were orthologs of atsoc <dig>  atagl <dig> and sitdr <dig>  respectively, were significantly down-regulated in ov <dig> and ov <dig> compared to control . the levels of gh_d13g <dig> and gh_a07g <dig>  which are orthologs of atap <dig> and atful, were slightly lower in ov <dig> and ov <dig> than control . similarly, atap <dig>  atful, atsoc <dig>  and atagl <dig> were also down-regulated in 35s::ghmir <dig> arabidopsis transgenic lines compared with the wild type . all the data indicated that mads-box genes, as candidate downstream genes of ghmir157-targeted spls, were down-regulated in over-expression lines.

expression pattern of ghmir <dig> and mir157-targeted ghspls during floral bud development
floral organ development in cotton lasts approximately a month from floral bud emergence to flower opening. based on floral bud length, we identified seven stages of floral bud development before flower opening . ovules appeared at the 4–6 mm floral bud stage. after that, the floral bud, including the differentiated four floral whorls, continued growing to approximately 25 mm in length before the flower opened. ghmir <dig> expression was very low at the 0–2 mm and 2–4 mm stages, but it was expressed at much higher levels at the 10–16 mm and 16–25 mm stages. generally, ghmir <dig> abundance increased during floral organ development . in opened flowers, ghmir <dig> was predominantly expressed in the anther and ovule, indicating that ghmir <dig> may play a role in anther and ovule maturation. high levels of ghmir <dig> could also be detected in the root, hypocotyl and leaf of seedlings .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of ghmir <dig> and ghspl expression patterns. a northern blot analysis of mature ghmir <dig> expression during floral organ bud developmental stages. b northern blot analysis of mature ghmir <dig> expression in different tissues. r, h, l, p, an, st, 0o, 3o, 5 f, 5o represent the root, hypocotyl, leaf, petal, anther, stigma,  <dig> dpa ovule,  <dig> dpa ovule,  <dig> dpa fibre, and  <dig> dpa ovule, respectively. c-m quantitative analysis of ghspl expression in different floral bud developmental stages. r.e.l., the relative expression levels calculated using histone <dig>  as a control. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of three biological replicates. different letters in the plots indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . n images of longitudinal sections of different length  of floral buds and opened flowers. the numbers 0– <dig>  2– <dig>  4– <dig>  6– <dig>  8– <dig>  10– <dig>  16– <dig> represent different lengths  of floral buds




the expression patterns of eight differentially expressed mir157-targeted ghspls  were analysed during floral organ development. and statistically significant differences of expression level among floral organ development stages was analysed, based on analysis of variance. since ghmir <dig> could trigger degradation of its targeted mrnas, the expression pattern of most mir157-targeted ghspls showed a decreasing trend during floral organ development. gh_a01g <dig>  gh_a01g <dig>  gh_a11g <dig>  and gh_a13g <dig> were obviously down-regulated during the floral bud developmental stages . the abundance of gh_a10g <dig> and gh_a11g <dig> also slightly decreased . however, expression patterns of gh_a04g <dig> and gh_a01g <dig> did not show an obvious trend during floral bud development . according to negative correlation of expression pattern between ghmir <dig> and most mir157-targeted ghspls, it is reasonable to speculate that ghmir <dig> could trigger degradation of its targeted mrnas to suppress the expression of mir157-targeted ghspls during floral organ development.

auxin signalling was attenuated in the over-expression lines
auxin plays an important role in flower development and floral organ size  <cit> . intriguingly, some auxin-inducible genes, such as iaa-amido synthase, auxin efflux carrier family protein and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, were substantially down-regulated in two over-expression lines compared to control . other well-known auxin-inducible genes, iaa and saur, also had slightly lower expression in ov <dig> lines than the control lines . to further verify the auxin signal difference between control and over-expression lines, we used the plants transfected with the dr5::gus vector to cross ov <dig> and control plants, respectively. since the dr <dig> promoter consists of seven repeats of an auxin-response element  <cit> , the dr5::gus reporter could be used to monitor the auxin response level. gus signalling in floral buds and ovules was lower in dr5::gus × ov <dig> than dr5::gus × control, indicating that auxin signalling was attenuated in the over-expression lines . however, transcript abundance of the key auxin biogenesis gene flavin monooxygenase  did not show significant differences between control and ov <dig> as determined by the rna-sequencing results . additionally, free iaa content was conversely lower in control than in ov <dig> and ov <dig> , which may indicate the existence of feedback regulation because the down-regulated atgh <dig>  ortholog in over-expression lines may decrease free iaa conjugation with amino acids. thus, we concluded that auxin signal transduction was attenuated in over-expression lines.fig.  <dig> auxin signalling was lower in over-expression lines than control. a-e real-time pcr analysis of auxin-inducible genes in floral buds. r.e.l., the relative expression levels calculated using histone <dig>  as a control. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of four biological replicates. different letters indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . f quantitative analysis of iaa content in the floral buds of control, ov <dig> and ov <dig> at − <dig> dpa. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of at least six biological replicates. different letters indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on analysis of variance  . g gus staining images of floral buds and ovules. images of floral buds  from dr5::gus × control  and dr5::gus × ov <dig>  and ovules from dr5::gus × control  and dr5::gus × ov <dig>  at − <dig> dpa. scale bar, 1 mm. h quantitative gus assays of ovules at − <dig> dpa. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences at p <  <dig>  based on student’s t test. control, nontransgenic plant segregated from 35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton. ov <dig> and ov <dig>  35s::ghmir <dig> transgenic lines in cotton. dr5::gus × control and dr5::gus × ov <dig> were f <dig> plants of dr5::gus crossed with control and ov <dig>  respectively




discussion
recently, a lot of mirnas have been identified through small rna sequencing in cotton . however, few of their function have been verified in cotton. in this study, we found that over-expression of ghmir <dig> in cotton could arrest cell proliferation and cell expansion, which repressed floral organ development and reduced the final organ size . since floral bud growth was arrested at very early emergence, ovule primordium establishment may be repressed in the over-expression line, which resulted in reduced ovule production. all these results demonstrated that ghmir <dig> may play an important role in floral organ development, although the mechanism needs to be further elucidated. ectopic expression of the ghmir <dig> precursor in arabidopsis also reduced the petal area, gynoecium length and ovule number, which was similar to the phenotype in cotton. since short gynoecium and few ovules were also found in 35s:atmir156b transgenic plants in arabidopsis  <cit> , it appears that the regulatory function in floral organ size and growth is conserved between species for mir156/ <dig>  over-expressing the atmir156b precursor in tomato did not reduce floral organ size but resulted in severe fruit development defects, indicating that the mir156/ <dig> family plays a major role in reproductive organ development among different species  <cit> .

spl transcription factors have been reported as mir156/ <dig> targets in many species  <cit> , and degradome sequencing also demonstrated that ghspls are targets of mir156/ <dig> in cotton  <cit> . additionally, in all the differentially expressed genes between the over-expression line and control, only spl transcription factors were predicted as mir <dig> targets, and five ghspls were further verified as mir <dig> targets using rlm-race . the expression patterns of ghmir <dig> and several targeted ghspls were generally negatively correlated during the floral organ developmental stages . therefore, it is reasonable to presume that ghspls as mir <dig> targets play important roles in floral organ development.

in arabidopsis, atspls could directly promote mads-box transcription factors, such as atsoc <dig>  atap <dig>  and atful, to control phase transition . in our study, the atsoc <dig> ortholog and two other mads-box transcription factors, the atagl <dig> ortholog and sitdr <dig> ortholog, were significantly down-regulated in the over-expression lines compared to control . the agl <dig> clade of mads-box genes is very similar to the closely related e class mads-box genes and could serve as a scaffold to interact with other a, b, c and d class mads-box transcription factors to form combinatorial quaternary complexes . dominant loss of function of the agl <dig> clade of mads-box genes by fusing a conserved suppressing motif to the proteins resulted in much smaller floral organs and partial sterility in arabidopsis  <cit> . sitdr <dig> is another clade of mads-box genes, which was not found in arabidopsis  <cit> . dominant loss of function of sitdr <dig> leads to alteration of ovary shape and seedless fruits  <cit> . mads-box transcription factors play a crucial role in floral organ differentiation and development, and over-expressing mir <dig> in cotton resulted in smaller floral organs, fewer ovules and seeds, and attenuated female fertility, which partially reproduced the phenotype of mutants of these two genes in arabidopsis and tomato. therefore, it is likely that the mir157/spl axis regulated orthologs of atagl <dig> and sitdr <dig> in cotton to control normal floral organ growth. however, direct regulation of these two clades of mads-box genes in cotton by mir157-targeted ghspls should be verified in the future.

in addition to mads-box transcription factors, several auxin-inducible genes were down-regulated in over-expression lines compared with control . moreover, auxin signalling, which could be monitored by the dr5::gus reporter, was also lower in the over-expression lines than control . however, free iaa content was not lower . therefore, decreased auxin signalling in the over-expression lines was not due to iaa content but defects in signal transduction. the mechanism of how the mir157/spl axis functions in auxin signal transduction is not clear. interestingly, it was reported that the e class mads-box transcription factor sepallata <dig> could bind several arf recognition motifs, for example, the atgh <dig>  promoter region  <cit> . another study reported that mads-box transcription factors could interact with arf <dig>  <cit> . given that agl <dig> is functionally similar to sepallata <dig>  and the ortholog of atagl <dig> is down-regulated in over-expression lines, it is reasonable to hypothesize that mads-box transcription factors, which may be regulated by mir157-targeted spls, possibly serve as arf-like or arf partner-like molecules to transduce auxin signalling to regulate normal organ differentiation and growth.

finally, we propose a possible regulatory network of floral organ growth as described in fig.  <dig>  at floral bud emergence, there are low levels of ghmir <dig> and little degradation of its targets, ghspls mrnas. highly expressed mir157-targeted ghspls may activate transcription of mads-box genes, such as orthologs of atagl <dig> and sitdr <dig>  these mads-box transcription factors, or some unknown factors, may bind auxin response motifs of downstream gene promoters to transduce auxin signalling. activated auxin signalling and mads-box genes may further regulate downstream genes to establish normal organ primordium  and promote cell proliferation and cell expansion. in the late floral organ development stage, a high abundance of ghmir <dig> decreases ghspl expression to reduce the growth rate and accelerate floral organ  maturation for fertilization.fig.  <dig> a model for the potential mir157/spls axis in the regulatory network of floral organ development. the t shapes represent negative regulation. the dashed lines indicate hypothetical positive regulation




CONCLUSIONS
floral organs are crucial factors affecting the harvest of many crops and are complex reproductive organs that are regulated by many transcription factors and hormones  <cit> . here, we found that the mir157/spl axis could affect floral growth and size formation through regulating mads-box genes and auxin signal transduction. the work further illuminates molecular basis of floral organ development, which is helpful for improvement of cotton yield. future studies of the crosstalk between the mir157/spl axis and other factors in the regulation of floral organ development should be performed.
