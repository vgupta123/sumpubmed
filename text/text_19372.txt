BACKGROUND
genetic transformation of brassica juncea  has been an important area of research since the crop is one of the most important sources of edible oil and accounts for 12% of the total edible oil throughout the world. b. juncea is widely cultivated in many parts of the world. unfortunately, mustard cultivation is seriously affected by sap sucking hemipteran pest- lipaphis erysimi . infestation of the pest at the time of flowering and silique formation causes significant yield loss  <cit> . the nutritional constituents  of mustard plant at different growth stages are also reduced due to the aphid attack  <cit> . in india aphid causes 10– 90% yield loss of mustard depending upon the severity of infestation and stage of the plant at which aphid attacks  <cit> . in addition to the nutrient loss of plants, aphids also transmit pathogenic viruses which contributes to additional yield loss  <cit> .

application of chemical insecticides for controlling these insects leads to evolution of resistant biotypes. the most commonly used bio-control agent bt  toxin is useful for chewing insects such as lepidopteran and coleopterans but it is ineffective against hemipteran group of sucking insect pests  <cit> . several other proteins including α- amylase inhibitor, ribosome– inactivating proteins, enzyme inhibitors, arcelins, chitinases, ureases, modified storage proteins and lectins have been reported to be involved in plant defence against various insects. among these, plant lectins have been found to be potent insecticidal agents which play a crucial role in managing several important pests  <cit> . previous reports from this group demonstrated that a homodimeric mannose binding allium sativum leaf agglutinin  exhibits insecticidal activity against sap sucking hemipterans namely, mustard aphid, rice brown planthopper, green leafhopper and chickpea aphid. consequently, transgenic expression of asal had been accomplished in mustard, rice, and chickpea  <cit> .

generally, in the process of development of transgenic plants, selectable marker genes  are utilised to select transgenic events. smgs are generally conditionally dominant genes which code for enzymes capable of inactivating different toxic agents such as antibiotics, herbicides  <cit> . in recent days, public concern has developed regarding the indiscriminate introduction of smgs in natural ecosystem  <cit> . antibiotic or herbicide resistant genes may have chances to be transferred by outcrossing into weeds or rarely, through horizontal gene transfer to other organisms  <cit> . additionally, continuous expression of the markers may interfere with normal plant growth and development  <cit> . thus, it is desirable to eliminate the smg after establishment of transgenic plant  <cit> .

development of herbicide or antibiotic resistant marker gene free transgenic plants could ease release and commercialization of transgenic crop  <cit> . in the last few years several strategies have been employed for removal of selectable markers  <cit>  including co-transformation  <cit>  transposon mediated repositioning of the gene of interest  <cit> , exploitation of multi- auto- transformation system  <cit>  and site – specific recombination system  <cit> . among several strategies, cre/lox p induced site- specific recombination strategy observed in bacteriophage p <dig> has been widely used for recombination mediated elimination of the smgs  <cit> . the 38 kda cre recombinase specifically recognizes and induces precise excision of dna fragment between two directly repeated asymmetric 34 bp lox p sites  <cit> .

in the present study, cre/lox mediated recombination system has been used to produce marker gene free asal expressing transgenic insect resistant mustard plants. to carry out this study, initially two types of transgenic lines were generated using two independent vectors, one having the antibiotic resistant hpt gene flanked by two lox p sites and asal gene under the control of camv 35s promoter and another vector with cre recombinase gene cassette along with the herbicide resistant gene bar. these t <dig> plants were reciprocally crossed. a substantial number of hybrid plants exhibited loss of hpt gene due to cre/lox recombination, and were analysed for resistance against the target insect lipaphis erysimi. these plants were allowed to self-fertilize to obtain f <dig> plants. elimination of the cre gene  was accomplished by genetic segregation, thus obtaining completely marker-free mustard plants expressing asal.

methods
plant material
brassica juncea cv. b- <dig> seeds were obtained from berhampur pulse research station, west bengal, india and used for plant transformation.

plant transformation vector
details of construction of the vector pbkhgasal   was reported earlier by the present group  <cit> , which contains asal gene under the control of camv 35s promoter and nos terminator within hindiii/ ecori site plus the hygromycin resistance gene  cassette flanked by lox sites. the  <dig>  kb cre coding sequence was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pcambia <dig> along with herbicide resistant marker bar and named as pbk <dig>   . the details of this cloning were previously reported by chakraborti et al.  <cit> . all these vectors were mobilized into the agl- <dig> strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens.

mustard transformation
a. tumefaciens mediated transformation and regeneration of mustard were performed according to the method described by mehra et al.  <cit>  with some modifications  <cit> . selection media containing either 30 mg/l hygromycin or 5 mg/l bialaphos were used to select calli and shoots transformed by pbkhgasal or pbk <dig> . after root induction the plants were transferred to soil in glass house at 25°c under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod regime. identical regeneration steps were also carried out without infecting explants with a. tumefaciens. these explants were grown in the absence of antibiotics and used as control plants.

screening of transgenic plants by pcr
the analysis of t <dig>  t <dig>  f <dig> hybrid and f <dig> plants were carried out with the dna extracted from mature leaf tissue of putative transformed plants as well as control plants  <cit> . polymerase chain reactions  were performed in all lines using asal, hpt and cre specific forward and reverse primers . multiplex pcr was performed in f <dig> hybrid and f <dig> plants using qiagen multiplex pcr kit . each 50 μl pcr reaction mixture contained 1x pcr master mix including hot start taq dna polymerase. primers were used in  <dig>  μm concentration. the reaction started with incubation for 15 min at 94°c followed by 35 cycles of 30s at 94°c, 90 s at 58°c, 90 s at 72°c and final extension with 10 min at 72°c in my cycler . in all pcr experiments pbkhgasal plasmid was taken as positive control for asal, hpt genes and pbk <dig>  plasmid was taken as positive control for cre gene. the amplification products of asal, cre and hpt genes were checked in  <dig> % agarose gel.

crossing of t <dig> transgenic lines
t <dig> plants were self pollinated to obtain t <dig> seeds. four t <dig>  lines were crossed with four t <dig>  lines reciprocally. eight independent crosses of transgenic plants were performed. f <dig> hybrid seeds were harvested, surface- sterilized and germinated on half strength ms basal medium in the dark at 25°c. germinated seedlings were transferred to greenhouse and maintained for further analysis.

southern blot analysis
total genomic dna was extracted from the mature leaves of one month old control and transgenic plants of t <dig>  and f <dig> hybrid lines. the southern blot hybridization was carried out according to sambrook et al.  <cit>  with modifications  <cit> . a total of 10 μg of genomic dna per line was digested with hindiii  followed by separation in  <dig> %  agarose gel. the gels were blotted onto positively charged nylon membranes . in southern blot experiment the following probes were used: 362 bp amplicon from the asal gene prepared by using primer pairs a <dig> and b1;  <dig>  kb amplicon from the cre gene produced by using primer pairs a <dig> and b2; 980 bp amplicon from the hpt gene generated by using primer pairs a <dig> and b <dig> . each probe was radio labeled with  dctp separately using rediprime ii™ random prime labeling system, . after hybridization followed by extensive washing the membranes were exposed to kodak x-ray film for seven days at -80°c and finally developed.

western blotting
total soluble protein from the leaves of one month old control and transgenic plants were extracted as described by dutta et al.  <cit>  and quantified. garlic leaf lectin  purified from fresh garlic leaves  <cit>  was used as positive control. western blotting was performed with 10 μg of total soluble protein of four t <dig> asal positive lines and nine f <dig> hybrid lines using the method as reported earlier  <cit> .

elisa
elisa was done as per the method described by dutta et al.  <cit> . microtiter  wells were coated with 50 μg of crude protein extracted from the leaves of f <dig> hybrid plants or purified native asal serially diluted from 5 μg to 500 ng overnight at 4°c in coating buffer. after addition of substrate o- phenylenediaminehydrochloride  dissolved in citrate buffer colour reaction was developed and the reading of the microtiter plate was recorded at 415 nm in a microtiter plate reader .

hemagglutination and thermal stability assay
the hemagglutination assay was carried out with the total soluble protein extracted from the f <dig> hybrid lines containing asal gene. blood was collected from the rabbit by a syringe pre- filled with 500 μl  <dig> % nacl solution and immediately transferred to a culture tube pre- filled with  <dig> % saline  <cit>  and subsequently dispensed into the wells of the plate. hemagglutination activity of expressed asal in selected f <dig> hybrid lines was assayed in a 96-well microtiter u-plate. protein was dispensed to each well at a 2-fold serial dilution starting from 250 μg to  <dig>  μg/ well. the u-plate was kept for 1 hour at 37°c and then hemagglutination was assessed visually.

the stability of the protein was assessed by its ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes upon incubation at different temperatures  <cit> . rabbit blood was diluted in  <dig> % nacl to a final concentration of 5% erythrocytes . the amount of total soluble protein from each of the selected asal expressing plant lines causing complete agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes was measured prior to assessing the stability of expressed asal. thus, 125 μg of the total soluble protein from all the selected asal expressing f <dig> hybrid plants were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline  and incubated separately at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 95°c for  <dig> mins. upon incubation, each sample was subjected to rapid cooling on ice and agglutination activity was monitored.

in planta insect bioassay
f <dig> hybrid plants bearing asal gene and control plants were subjected to bioassay with nymphs of l. erysimi. cages with one end open were used for insect bioassay. about twenty nymphs of l. erysimi of 3rd instar stage were collected from the culture stock and transferred onto the leaf surface of the plants which were already placed in the glass cages. the open end of the cage was sealed with adhesive tape. three such cages were used per individual transgenic and control plant. three replications were performed for each individual line. the survival of insects within the cages was monitored at an interval of every 24 hrs for 9 days. the mean data per plant was expressed as the percentage of the total aphids surviving on the respective days. effect of asal on fecundity of the insect was monitored by counting the total number of nymphs produced per individual transgenic plants at the end of the bioassay period. anova followed by duncun’s multiple range tests were conducted to compare the significance of differences among all the transgenic and control plants for the insect bioassay experiment.

RESULTS
development of asal and cre lines
southern blot analysis was carried out to check successful integration of transgene in putatively transformed t0asal-lox-hpt-lox and cre - bar containing plants developed by agrobacterium mediated transformation. plant no. la, lb, ld, lf showed single copy insertion of asal gene, lc was a double copy insertion event and le was found to be southern negative . in case of cre plants, plant no. ca, cc, cd, ce were single copy insertion events and cb was found to be southern negative . single copy insertion lines of asal and cre were used for further analysis. expression of asal was also confirmed by western blotting in the single copy asal insertion lines . eight reciprocal crosses were made between four t1asal positive plants of asal-lox-hpt-lox lines: la <dig>  lb <dig>  ld <dig>  lf <dig> and four t1cre positive plants of cre-bar lines: ca <dig>  cc <dig>  cd <dig>  ce <dig> .

molecular analysis of gene excision
from the eight independent crossing events, seeds were collected separately and multiplex pcr was performed to screen out the hybrid plants. the results of hybrid line la2cc <dig> is shown here . thirty seeds were randomly chosen from hybrid line la2cc <dig> . multiplex pcr was performed with asal and cre gene specific primers . among the  <dig> progeny plants,  <dig> plants were found to be positive for both asal gene and cre gene;  <dig> for only asal gene,  <dig> plants only for cre gene and  <dig> plants were azygous for both the genes . the marker gene excision among the  <dig> asal and cre positive hybrid plants of la2cc <dig>  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were further verified through pcr  using hpt gene specific primers. this amplification identified nine hpt negative plants where cre did work efficiently; as a result excision of hpt took place through recombination event. following nine plants: la2cc <dig>  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were found to be hpt negative. thus, the cre/lox mediated recombination frequency was determined to be  <dig> % in case of hybrid line la2cc <dig>  the nine hybrid plants were further verified through southern blotting experiments using three different probes for asal, cre and hpt  which clearly showed the absence of hpt gene  but the presence of asal and cre genes  in those nine hybrid plants. recombination frequency in another seven hybrid lines varied between  <dig>  - 50%.

expression of asal in f <dig> hybrid lines
nine hpt negative la2cc <dig> f <dig> hybrid progeny plants were analyzed to monitor the expression of asal. western blot of total soluble protein extracted from 30 days old plants’ leaves of those nine lines showed identical signals at ~12 kda region , corresponding to the purified native asal protein when probed with anti- asal antibody. in control plants no such band was observed. elisa was performed to quantify the level of expressed asal in the selected plants. these nine plants showed level of expression of asal in the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total soluble protein .

agglutination and thermal stability assay
the hemagglutination assay was performed with the extracted total soluble protein from five f <dig> hybrid asal positive plants . a tight button of rabbit erythrocytes was formed indicating negative reaction in well no.  <dig> – no protein control and well no.  <dig> - containing protein samples of untransformed plants in panel i-v. five f <dig> hybrid lines exhibited agglutination of rbcs resulting in the formation of a layer over the wells  of the microtiter plate . this result confirmed the retention of agglutination property in the transgenically expressed asal protein.

thermal stability assay was conducted by monitoring the agglutination characteristics of asal, extracted from the above mentioned five f <dig> hybrid plants. asal lost its agglutination activity when treated at 55-75°c .

in planta insect bioassay
in order to investigate the effect of asal on survivability of l. erysimi, in planta insect bioassay was carried out in bioassay cages  over 9 days time period using five asal expressing hpt negative f <dig> hybrid plants of la2cc <dig> line. the survival of aphid was monitored with third instar nymphs at an interval of 24 h. it was observed that survival of the nymphs declined from 20 ±  <dig>  to 13 ±  <dig>   per control plant over the assay period, but the decline of mustard aphid on the asal expressing five progenies of la2cc <dig> hybrid plant line varied from 6 ±  <dig>   to 7 ±  <dig>   at the end of the bioassay period . the mean number of surviving lipaphis on control and transgenic plants were found to be statistically significant  after 3rd day. it was observed that after 9 days of the experiment the asal expressing line no. la2cc <dig> , la2cc <dig> , and la2cc <dig>  showed maximum decrease in insect survivability. the effect of asal on fecundity was determined by counting the total nymphs produced by the adult insects on transformed and control plants at the end of the bioassay period. the nymph started developing into non- feeding alate form after 4 days of the initiation of bioassay experiment. the number of nymphs produced per plant was reduced by approximately 41% – 59% compared to control plants .

establishment of marker free f <dig> plants
since the f1hpt negative hybrid plants are cre positive, it is very likely that they are also bar positive. therefore, some of the f <dig> progeny plants were allowed to self- fertilize to obtain f <dig> plants and analyzed for complete marker removal mediated by genetic segregation. ten f <dig> progeny plants of the hpt negative line la2cc <dig>  were analyzed for the presence of asal, hpt and cre genes. three plants  were found to contain only asal, one plant  showed the presence of only cre and six plants contained both asal and cre genes  .

discussion
the elimination of the marker gene product is desirable in the context of environmental safety  <cit> . in view of this, cre/loxp site specific recombination system was used in the present study for the development of antibiotic resistant smg free mustard lines with enhanced insect resistance property. the cre/lox system has been tested for several plants including arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  and found to be highly effective.

cre/lox mediated marker gene elimination in brassica juncea was reported for the first time by arumugam et al. <cit>  where they cross pollinated the plants after the development of two homozygous lines with two different constructs. kopertekh et al. <cit>  has shown marker elimination phenomenon in brassica napus using a binary vector containing both cre and marker gene within the same lox sites which was adopted earlier in arabidopsis <cit> , maize  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> .

the average frequency of marker gene elimination in the present study was  <dig> % which was significantly higher than the recombination frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> % observed earlier by hoa et al.  <cit>  and sreekala et al.  <cit>  respectively. the recombination frequency obtained herein was also higher than the frequency of  <dig> % obtained by chakraborti et al. <cit>  and  <dig> % by sengupta et al.  <cit>  in case of marker gene free transgenic lines of tobacco and rice, respectively. the efficiency of recombination was also comparable to that reported in the flp/frt hybrids of tobacco  <cit> . incidentally, arumugam et al.  <cit>  got higher marker excision frequency of 53% by using cre/lox system in quiescent, differentiated somatic tissues of f <dig> plants. previous studies by stuurman et al. in tomato  <cit> , bar et al. in tobacco  <cit> , onouchi et al. in arabidopsis <cit>  and sreekala et al. in rice  <cit>  have shown that recombination efficiency varied among and within crosses. the cause of such variation might be due to chromosomal localization of the transgene or variations in the cre recombinase activity in different events. to overcome this problem bayley et al.  <cit>  proposed to select parents with strong expression of cre recombinase. the sexual crossing between two different lines led to the precise and complete elimination of the lox flanked marker gene in the subsequent generation indicating the advantage of the crossing strategy over others. in the present study, the cre gene was found to be segregated out in f <dig> progeny plants of hpt negative asal expressing line la2cc <dig> as it was observed in asal expressing hygromycin resistance marker gene free transgenic rice lines developed earlier by this group  <cit> . finally, asal positive and both hpt and cre negative f <dig> mustard plants were established.

the transgenically expressed asal protein was found to be stable up to 37°c, but loses its functionality when heated at 55- 75°c which is comparable to the data shown by mondal et al.  <cit>  which eliminated all the possibility of native asal protein to be an allergen.

extensive in planta insect bioassay was performed on asal expressing marker gene free f <dig> hybrid plants with l. erysimi. effect of asal on the mortality of mustard aphid was comparable to the results shown by dutta et al.  <cit> . insect mortality in the present asal expressing transgenic plants was 70% which is comparable to 89% observed by dutta et al.  <cit>  while in control plants the insect mortality was 35%. however, insect mortality observed in the present study was either comparable or higher than most of the results of earlier work where constitutive expression of gna led to mortality of bph up to  <dig> -62%  <cit>  and 45-50%  <cit>  and in case of glh up to 51-54%  <cit> . but sengupta et al.  <cit>  documented insect mortality in asal expressing rice plants as high as 72% in glh and 71% in bph bioassay. the level of asal expression observed in the transgenic mustard plants was fairly comparable to the data of dutta et al.  <cit> . the level of asal expression was also correlated with the fecundity of the insects. the number of nymphs produced per plant was reduced compared to control plants. usually l. erysimi propagates parthenogenetically, resulting in formation of huge population in a short period of time. thus, reduction in number of nymphs produced due to the effect of asal is of considerable significance in controlling aphid infestation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study significantly establishes the efficient expression of the insect resistant asal gene in transgenic brassica juncea plants following cre/lox mediated recombination which resulted in the elimination of the selectable marker gene. this important achievement has a great impact on development of insect-resistant, environment- friendly mustard crop which could be important components of integrated pest management programme.
