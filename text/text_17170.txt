BACKGROUND
the witwatersrand supergroup is a  <dig>  billion year old formation of low-permeability sandstone and shale with minor volcanic units and conglomerates. the ambient temperature of the rock at levels in excess of  <dig> km is approximately 60°c  <cit> . these mines provide access to water emanating at levels up to  <dig> km  <cit> . although approximately  <dig> bacterial and archaeal organisms have been identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing, very few have been successfully cultivated. detailed analysis of fissure water from many different sites in south african mines  <cit>  has illustrated severe nutrient limitation which would require special adaptation by the microbial communities  <cit> .

hundreds of strains of thermus have been isolated from various thermal environments around the world. all are thermophilic, gram negative bacteria which grow optimally at temperatures between  <dig> to 70°c with no specific amino acid or vitamin requirements  <cit> . in  <dig> kieft et al.  <cit>  described the isolation and characterization of a facultatively anaerobic thermus strain from water collected  <dig>  km below surface, which is capable of dissimilatory iron reduction as well as growth with oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors. the thermus sa- <dig> strain  is closely related to thermus strains nmx <dig>  a. <dig> and vi- <dig>  and was identified as t. scotoductus  <cit> . its ability to reduce chromate, gold and uranium was illustrated  <cit>  and the chromate reductase was found to be an old yellow enzyme homologue  <cit> . in addition, a membrane associated "chromate reductase"  <cit>  and "iron reductases"  <cit>  were isolated.

the complete genome sequences of thermus thermophilus strains hb <dig> and hb <dig>  <cit>  have been determined. in both cases, a chromosome of slightly larger than  <dig>  mbp and a megaplasmid of  <dig> to  <dig> kbp were found. in addition, hb <dig> harbors a smaller plasmid of  <dig>  kbp . a high degree of synteny is found between the chromosomes of the two strains, except for an inversion near the origin of replication and the majority of the genes are conserved. a degree of plasticity is observed in the megaplasmids and it has been suggested that the major portion of the genes on the plasmid may be involved with a thermophilic lifestyle  <cit> . recently, ohtani and co-workers  <cit>  demonstrated that thermus thermophilus is polyploid under certain growth conditions and that this could be part of the survival strategy in thermophilic environments, where homologous recombination of chromosomes could be a mechanism of chromosome repair, as in deinococcus radiodurans  <cit> . this implies a dynamic genome where rearrangement of genes occurs with high frequency. in addition to the plasticity of thermus genomes, their system of uptake and horizontal exchange of dna fragments is the most efficient reported to date  <cit> . together, these provide a mechanism for adaptation to harsh environments.

we report here the complete genome sequence of thermus scotoductus sa- <dig> and demonstrate how its hyperplasticity and it natural ability to acquire genes have enabled its adaptation to the subsurface.

RESULTS
general features of the t. scotoductus sa- <dig> complete chromosome sequence
the genome was sequenced with an approx. 20-fold coverage. the  <dig> contigs obtained from a combination of gs20/flx pyrosequence runs were assembled with additional sanger sequencing to close the gaps between the contigs. the genome of t. scotoductus sa- <dig> consists of a  <dig> , <dig> bp chromosome   and a draft plasmid sequence of  <dig>  bp   with an average g+c content of  <dig> %, similar to the t. scotoductus sa- <dig> chromosome of  <dig> %  and compared to the approximately 69% of thermus thermophilus. based on gc skew analysis, the origin of replication was identified as the location of the gene dnaa which encodes the chromosomal replication initiation protein dnaa . manual curation of automatic annotation by deleting overlapping genes and curating gene starts resulted in  <dig>  cds on the chromosome. proteins of unknown function, hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins constituted  <dig> % of the total compared to  <dig> % and  <dig> % for hb <dig> and hb <dig>  respectively .

genome comparisons
for the majority of genes present in the t. scotoductus sa- <dig> chromosome, their orthologous counterparts are found in the t. thermophilus chromosomes and plasmids. however, the syntenies of genes have not been preserved and the large plasmids of hb <dig> and hb <dig> contain genes, which are located on the chromosome in sa- <dig> . several loci on the sa- <dig> chromosome are absent from the chromosomes of t. thermophilus . the distribution of t. thermophilus plasmid genes on the chromosome of t. scotoductus seems to be arbitrary . functional analysis of the t. thermophilus megaplasmid genes using the pathway tools software showed that enzymes of several metabolic pathways are almost completely encoded by the plasmid genes, namely: coenzyme b <dig> synthesis and metabolism; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis and adenosylcobalamin salvage pathways; datp, dgtp and dutp biosynthetic pathways; neurosporene and siroheme biosynthesis; and many other genes encoding acyl-coa dehydrogenases, isomerases, oxidoreductase, glucosidases, galactosidases and other enzymes involved in the secondary metabolism. the plasmid genes form neat operon structures, for example the  <dig> genes of the adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis pathway. this is consistent with the observation that operons might be considered as the basic unit of recombinational events between species  <cit> . it may be hypothesized that these operons were well organized within an ancestral genome, which served as a donor for the plasmid formation in t. thermophilus after which an unknown genetic burst randomized the genes on the chromosomes and parts of the t. scotoductus chromosome were lost  with only  <dig> of the original megaplasmid genes remaining . the lost genes include the cobalamine biosynthesis pathway, plasmid stability protein and para and parb chromosome partitioning family proteins. the t. scotoductus loci which were not found in the t. thermophilus chromosomes, might represent sequences which were either deleted from the chromosome of an ancestral organism or could be genes acquired by lateral transfer.

horizontally transferred genes and gene islands
the different approaches for identification of horizontally transferred genes, codon usage bias , oligonucleotide usage patterns , database comparisons , g+c content, similarity searches or phylogenetic approaches for predicting ht genes or gene islands show varying success. for this reason we combined different approaches to try and reach a consensus.

based upon the initial analysis of the protein coding genes of t. scotoductus sa- <dig> using karlin's codon usage method  <cit> ,  <dig>  orfs showed codon usage differences above the threshold values and were identified as horizontally transferred candidate genes . blast and phylogenetic analysis showed that 80% of the ht genes showed homology to those of organisms belonging to either closely or distantly related lineage. laterally acquired genes in t. scotoductus sa- <dig> show close homology with species belonging to diverse phyla predominantly within the bacterial domain . putative donor prediction by blast, neighbour joining or maximum likelihood prediction produced essentially the same results. the majority of the acquired genes  are from species of the phylum deinococcus-thermus, supporting the evidence of lateral transfer from other sister thermus species  <cit> . furthermore, most of the horizontally acquired genes excluding the deinococcus-thermus were either from distantly related proteobacteria  or firmicutes  and many of the genes have been transferred from microorganisms either having hyperthermophilic  or thermophilic  lifestyles . the high proportion of genes from firmicutes have been recently recognized in thermophilic bacteria, particularly in the genome sequence of thermosipho africanus tcf52b, and they emerged as principal donors in thermophiles  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis also identified the possible closest homolog, which was the same as the best hit in the majority of the cases .

analysis of the thermus thermophilus hb <dig> and hb <dig> genomes produced a similar number of putative ht genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  on the chromosomes and  <dig>  and  <dig>  on the megaplasmids, respectively . blast search of the ht genes of t. thermophilus hb <dig> against the proteins of hb <dig> and sa- <dig> was performed to determine which of the ht genes were shared . of the hb <dig> sequences, 56% and 35% had homologs, while 37% and 6% of the homologs were also predicted as alien, in hb <dig> and sa- <dig> respectively. only  <dig>  of the hb <dig> sequences had homologs in both hb <dig> and sa- <dig>  the ht genes of hb <dig> which are absent in hb <dig>  are found in small groups on the chromosome and megaplasmid. a significant fraction of the ht gene homologs of hb <dig> were not predicted as ht genes in hb <dig> and sa- <dig>  in some cases, the gene next to the hb <dig> homolog in hb <dig> or sa- <dig> were predicted as ht. this could be an effect of amelioration or may reflect errors in the prediction so the results should be interpreted with caution.

in sa- <dig> there are many inserts not found in t. thermophilus, which have an alternative oligonucleotide composition compared to the chromosome. islands i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig> and i <dig>  of the predicted genomic islands of sa- <dig> are inside the chromosomal loci that are absent in t. thermophilus genomes , with a part of i <dig> not present in t. thermophilus. other strain specific regions  in the sa- <dig> genome were adapted to the sa- <dig> sequence composition by the genome amelioration process  <cit> .

hypothetical proteins form the major part of the island genes, especially so for island  <dig>  island  <dig> contains predominantly enzymes involved in o-antigen synthesis, while enzymes involved in dna processing and integration are interspersed. island  <dig> hosts a variety of proteins in common with meiothermus ruber dsm  <dig>  including von willebrand factor , conserved hypothetical proteins  and two operons relating to metabolism of phenolics, tsc_c <dig> - tsc_c <dig> and tsc_c <dig> - tsc_c <dig>  corresponding to mrub_ <dig> - mrub_ <dig> and mrub_ <dig> - mrub <dig>  respectively. these appear to have been directly acquired from meiothermus ruber dsm  <dig>  the former operon having undergone an inversion in sa- <dig> . the remainder of the genes in i <dig> have the closest orthologs in t. thermophilus or a variety of organisms including geobacter, t. aquaticus, deinococcus deserti, leptospirillum or anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans.

a consensus prediction of ht islands can be seen in figure  <dig>  with clusters of ht genes corresponding to the predicted islands. the islands are also further highlighted by anomalous gc content. the association with t-rna genes , a phage integrase gene associated with trna-ile and followed by  <dig> hypothetical genes in a reverse direction to the integrase , an atp-dependent dna helicase pcra and a single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein which may be parts of the former plasmid replication machinery  and an is <dig> family transposase , provide clues to the possible mechanism of integration. taken together with the comparison of the genomes of sa- <dig>  hb <dig> and hb <dig> and their putative ht genes, this suggests that t. scotoductus sa- <dig> has a highly plastic genome and that it has adapted to its subsurface environment by the acquisition or loss of genes or gene islands.

transporters, sensing and energy metabolism
we have identified  <dig> abc transporters, including amino acid, phosphonate, phosphate, glucose, sugar, taurine, polyamine, ribose, cation, sodium-alanine symporter, trehalose mycolates, ammonium transporter, and other permeases . fe iron import  and two multidrug resistance proteins . t. scotoductus sa- <dig> retains pathways for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, pyruvate dehydrogenase, the tricarboxylic acid cycle , glyoxylate cycle and beta oxidation .

atp synthesis is accomplished by type v atpases, which appear in a cluster of nine genes , compared to the v/a type in hb <dig>  a cluster of sox genes   are also present in the genome of sa- <dig>  located downstream of a number of cytochrome c genes , which have a high similarity to the same proteins present in thermus thermophilus hb <dig> and hb <dig> strains. the cluster of sox genes present in t. thermophilus is homologous to the sox genes present in sulfur-oxidizing organisms  <cit>  and might have been horizontally transferred from an aquifex aeolicus like species with some local rearrangements  <cit> . the presence of this sox operon suggests that sa- <dig> can oxidize sulfur compounds as a source of energy. the polysulfide reductase tsc_c <dig>  and nrfd  which is not present in hb <dig> or hb <dig> enables sa- <dig> to use s <dig> as electron acceptor  <cit> . the ability to reduce sulfur using hydrogen or organic substrates is widespread amongst thermophiles. blast searches showed that the closest orthologs of the tsc_c <dig> are from thermincola sp. jr, thermobaculum terrenum atcc baa- <dig> , thermosinus carboxydivorans nor <dig> , acidiphilium cryptum jf- <dig>  anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, desulfitobacterium hafniense. this suggests that the additional nrfd gene was obtained by horizontal gene transfer after separation of sa- <dig> from the other thermus species.

the diverse metabolic capacity, abundance of sensor histidine kinases and transporters are indicative of oligotrophy, possibly in a dense and diverse population which could provide carbon and nitrogen compounds either from their metabolism or the breakdown of dead cells. wanger et al.  <cit>  illustrated that prolific, organic rich biofilms can be found at mineral surfaces in fracture zones in the deep subsurface and that these could serve as a, so far underestimated, source of c, n and p for cells in these biofilms. the absence of flagella proteins, but the presence of twitching motility proteins , chemotaxis transducer proteins , pilt proteins tsc_c <dig>  tsc_c <dig>  tsc_c  <dig>  tsc_c20130), enzymes for s-layer synthesis  and an s-layer repressor  , suggest a sessile lifestyle. even in a planktonic phase, sufficient nutrients could be available in the water to sustain essential metabolic processes  <cit> , albeit slowly  <cit> .

aerobic respiration
the genome of t. scotoductus sa- <dig> encodes numerous genes assigned to a classical electron transport chain. complex  <dig> nadh quinone oxidoreductases, nuoa - nuon are in a cluster , nqo <dig> , and two quinone oxidoreductases, one found on the plasmid . complex ii consists of succinate dehydrogenase , sdha , sdhb <dig> and sdhb <dig> . sa- <dig> has the 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex including dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase lpda <dig>  and lpda <dig> . the terminal cytochrome oxidase consists of  <dig> cytochrome c oxidase genes ctac <dig> , caaa , ctah, ctae <dig>  ctae <dig>  ctad <dig>  coxm  and ctad <dig>  ctac <dig> . orthologous genes for the recently described complex iii of hb <dig>  could be identified in sa- <dig>   <cit> .

metal reduction, arsenic detoxification and respiration
many bacteria and archaea, including sa- <dig>  <cit>  display the ability to reduce metals  <cit> . these may be dissimilatory, detoxification or "accidental" processes. in some cases, specific proteins have been isolated and characterized e.g. the "chromate reductases" but significance of these activities remains uncertain, as it may be a secondary activity unrelated to their physiological roles  <cit> .

dissimilatory metal reduction is possibly the best studied in shewanella oneidensis and geobacter. sulfurreducens with  <dig> and  <dig> c-type cytochromes respectively, which may be indicative of their highly branched electron transfer transport systems that convey extensive versatility in terms of electron acceptor utilization  <cit> . in addition, marshall et al.  <cit>  showed experimentally that the c-type cytochromes of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> are essential for the reduction of u and formation of extracellular uo <dig> nanoparticles. the  <dig> c-type cytochromes found in sa- <dig> may explain its metal reducing abilities. blast analysis, however, indicate that none of the c-type cytochromes present in t. scotoductus sa- <dig> are similar to those in s. oneidensis or g. sulfurreducens.

arsenite oxidase genes aoxa , aoxb  and the arsr transcription regulator , a hypothetical protein and a transcriptional repressor  form a cluster in sa- <dig>  in hb <dig>  the large and small subunit genes are found on the plasmid with the arsr located on the chromosome . in addition sa- <dig> contains three more arsr transcriptional regulator genes; tsc_c <dig> upstream of a nickel resistance protein, tsc_c <dig> upstream of hyfb,c,e,f,g; nadh dehydrogenase  iron-sulfur protein  <dig> and a soluble hydrogenase small subunit in a cluster and tsc_c <dig> upstream of a aaa-atpase. the arsenite oxidase converts arsenite to arsenate and is probably part of a detoxification pathway  <cit>  but the presence of an arsenite oxidase suggests that aerobic arsenic respiration is possible by sa- <dig>  aerobic arsenite respiration  is well known in chemolithoautotrophs  <cit> . the dissimilatory use of as as electron acceptor by a thermus isolate hr <dig> was described by gihring and banfield  <cit>  who proposed that hr <dig> could oscillate between arsenite detoxification and arsenate respiration in microaerophilc culture. hr <dig> could however not grow with as as sole energy source indicating that the as oxidising system was probably not respiratory. their cultures were however not aerated so this question is not resolved. apart from the arsenate reductase , none of the other arsenate respiratory proteins are found in sa- <dig>  arsenite oxidation was also demonstrated for thermus aquaticus and thermus thermophilus  <cit> . complete arsenic redox cycling has so far been observed only in thermus  <cit> , bacillus  <cit>  species and marinobacter santoriniensis  <cit> .

the arsr family represents a class of transcriptional regulatory proteins that allowing prokaryotes to respond to stress induced by heavy metal toxicity  <cit> . tsc_c <dig> has an ortholog in desulfouridis audaxviator .

denitrification
complete reduction of nitrate to ammonia can occur via the assimilatory nitrate reductase and cytochrome c- <dig> ,  and a ferredoxin-nitrite reductase . a nitrate inducible formate dehydrogenasetsc_c <dig> can also couple to the respiratory nitrate reductase to generate a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane.

a dna fragment named the "nitrate respiratory conjugative element" in a different thermus thermophilus strain  <cit>  codes for the nar and nrc operons as well as their regulatory machinery. in t. thermophilus, the nrcdefn operon is located upstream of the nar operon. the corresponding sequence in sa- <dig> codes for a nadh dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase b subunit and two hypothetical proteins corresponding to nrce and nrcd  . the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the nrce equivalent of sa- <dig>  which consists of  <dig> amino acids, shows 87% identity with residues  <dig> -  <dig> of t. thermophilus nrce which is absent in hb <dig> and hb <dig>  presumably this complex could be functional in sa- <dig> 

downstream of the nrc operon in t. thermophilus  <cit> , lies the nar operon consisting of narcghjikt. in sa- <dig>  the genes for a nitrite extrusion protein, nark <dig>  nari, narj, narh, narg and a periplasmic cytochrome c gene, which are not present in hb <dig> or hb <dig>  form a cluster  adjacent to regulatory protein a and a denitrification regulator  which is the start of a large cluster of genes, completing the denitrification process up to nitrous oxide . the cluster contains ferredoxin  <dig>  a conserved hypothetical proteins, coenzyme pqq synthesis protein pqqe, nitrite reductase, conserved hypothetical protein, nitric oxide reductase subunit b norb, norc and what seems a copper containing nitrite reductase , transcriptional regulator, cation binding domain protein, nadh dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase b subunit . a ferredoxin nitrite reductase  is also found in hb <dig> and hb <dig>  the presence of both a cytochrome cd <dig> and a copper containing nitrite reductases in the same organism is exceptional. distant orthologs of the nark <dig> protein , the alpha and beta subunit of nitrate reductase and the periplasmic cytochrome are found in hb <dig> and hb <dig>  blast searches, however, indicated that the closest orthologs of all the other genes, except for ferredoxin  <dig>  which is found in hb <dig> and hb <dig>  were from thermus thermophilus  <cit>  , meiothermus silvanus dsm  <dig>  haloferax volcanii ds <dig>  persephonella marina ex-h <dig>  hydrogenobacter thermophilus tk- <dig> and thioalkalivibrio sp. k90mix . the entire segment of dna therefore appears to have been acquired by the thermus thermophilus and thermus scotoductus sa- <dig> from a distant donor/s. these genes were however not identified as acquired by any of the methods used. balkwill et al  <cit>  showed that t. scotoductus sa- <dig> could grow using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor.

dna transformation
natural competence  has been observed in t. thermophilus strains. high frequencies of natural transformation has been displayed by this organism  <cit>  and schwarzenlander and averhoff  <cit>  proposed that the extraordinary broad substrate specificity of the highly efficient t. thermophilus hb <dig> dna uptake system may contribute significantly to thermoadaptation of the organism by interdomain dna transfer in hot environments. the natural transformation system of hb <dig> comprises at least  <dig> distinct competence proteins  <cit> . among the  <dig> competence proteins the genes encoding pilm, piln, pilo, pilw, and pilq are found to be most essential for rendering natural transformation  <cit> . several genes associated with transformation have been identified in sa- <dig>  these include pilq , pilm, piln, pilo, and pilw , pilf  pilc , pild  comea , comec/rec <dig> , comf , comz , dpra  and competence-damage protein cina . in addition a fima  and four pilt domain proteins  are present. tsc_c <dig> and tsc_c <dig> are absent in hb <dig> and hb <dig> while tsc_c <dig> is found in hb <dig>  pila is absent in sa- <dig> and hb <dig>  but present in hb <dig>  four thermus species, t. thermophilus hb <dig> and hb <dig>  t. flavus at <dig>  t. caldophilus gk <dig>  and t. aquaticus yt <dig> have been demonstrated to be naturally competent, with hb <dig> showing the highest transformation frequency  <cit>  with a maximal uptake rate of about  <dig> kb/s per cell  <cit>  and with a broad specificity  <cit> .

the transformation assays with t. scotoductus sa- <dig> cultures consistently showed colonies  with the cells incubated with the pmknor plasmid but not with those incubated without dna. the number of t. thermophilus prq <dig> transformants was tenfold more with pmknor than those obtained for t. scotoductus. therefore, we concluded that t. scotoductus sa <dig> can be transformed with plasmids carrying dna sequences homologues to its chromosome. to confirm transformation in t. scotoductus sa <dig>  we compared the total protein pattern of the transformant colonies with that of the parental strain, and also carried out pcr amplification of the nirk gene, which is specific for t. scotoductus sa <dig>  the results  clearly demonstrate that transformants corresponds to t. scotoductus sa- <dig> and not to any contamination by other strain.

no putative self-replicating plasmid could be isolated by standard methods or by following a procedure for the isolation of total genomic dna. no plasmid-like bands were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transformation of e. coli ultra-competent cell preparations and selection on kanamycin plates was also unsuccessful. no colonies could be found which lost the kanamycin resistance after several rounds of growth without the antibiotic, whereas in t. thermophilus the pmk <dig> derivative was easily lost by this procedure  <cit> . transformation with pmknor is probably due to integration of the plasmid into the chromosome by homologous recombination.

it has been proposed  <cit>  that the pila 1- <dig> proteins may form a transformation shaft, which transports the dna through the outer membrane into the periplasmic space. the possibility exists that the presence of pila in hb <dig> and not in hb <dig> and sa- <dig> may be partly responsible for the superior transformability of hb <dig>  inactivation of the thermus traffic atpase pilf led to a loss of competence although the pili remained intact  <cit> . the thermus pilf could be functionally similar to the gonococcal  <cit>  and pseudomonas stutzeri retraction atpase pilt  <cit> , which was demonstrated to be essential for competence. the role of the four pilt domain proteins in sa- <dig> needs to be elucidated. it is however evident that sa- <dig> possesses the machinery enabling it to take up dna and that this may be partly responsible for its adaptation to higher temperatures.

dna protection and repair
the synthesis of carotenoids by hb <dig> and hb <dig>  which imparts a yellow color to the cultures, has been proposed as an additional membrane and dna protection mechanism  <cit> . the entire gene cluster ttp57-ttp <dig> as well as the uv endonuclease is absent in sa- <dig>  considering that sa- <dig> was isolated from water collected more than  <dig> kilometers underground and that it probably resided there for a significant period of time, it evidences in favor of the photo-protective role of the carotenoids.

t. scotoductus sa- <dig> has genes for repair pathways that include dna replication, recombination and repair reca , ruvb , uvra , uvrb , gyra , gyrb , which were all upregulated in deinococcus radiodurans after gamma radiation, but it is lacking in kata, terb, terz, mrsa and dps, which encode for proteins alleviating oxidative stress  <cit> . in deinococcus radiodurans, a reca deficient mutant was shown to be gamma ray sensitive. wild type reca could complement the gamma ray sensitivity of e. coli reca1- strain  <cit> . sa- <dig> contains the cina, ligase and reca in a cluster , as well as recf , recr  and reco . the reca independent recombination repair system seems to be absent in sa- <dig>  of the hypothetical proteins upregulated by irradiation of deinococcus  <cit> , only ddra showed homology to two proteins tsc_c <dig> and tsc_c <dig>  which are rad52/ <dig> double-strand break repair protein in sa- <dig>  these genes are also absent in the desulfouridis audaxviator genome  <cit> . it seems then that the deep subsurface represents a less challenging environment, where mostly gamma radiation damage needs to be dealt with, possibly at lower levels. the reca-dependent recombination repair system, similar to d. radiodurans could presumably be sufficient protection.

viral resistance
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  are a distinctive feature of the genomes of most bacteria and archaea and are thought to be involved in resistance to bacteriophages with a resistance specificity determined by similarity between the spacers and phage sequences  <cit> . using a crisprfinder online program  on the t. scotoductus sa- <dig> chromosome revealed three crispr regions . regions  <dig> and  <dig> are associated with crispr associated proteins. in hb <dig> and hb <dig> we find  <dig> and  <dig> crisprs respectively, with only two on the chromosome and the remaining  <dig> or  <dig> on the megaplasmid. the presence of an intact crispr system could imply that the ancestral genome may have suffered an invasion of exogenous genetic components, but that with subsequent rearrangement and deletion events most of these were lost by sa- <dig> or that the t. thermophilus faced a more phage challenging environment after separation from t. scotoductus.

CONCLUSIONS
members of the phylum deinococcus-thermus are known for their resistance to heat and radiation. the thermus spp. are of the most widely spread  <cit>  and have colonized a number of environments typical for themophilic organisms. it should therefore come as no surprise that a thermus species should be found in the deep subsurface with ambient rock temperatures of 60°c or higher  <cit>  at the depth where thermus scotoductus sa- <dig> was discovered . fission track analysis in apatite in the wits basin suggests that only hyperthermophiles could have existed at these depths and that current microbial communities must have migrated to these depths more recently  <cit> . hyperthermophilic organisms currently found at these depths could be descendants of those initial inhabitants  <cit>  and could have served as donors of genetic material to sa- <dig>  assisting in thermoadaptation. the natural competence of t. scotoductus sa- <dig> could have been instrumental in the adaptation to these hot environments  <cit> . the earlier notion that most of the megaplasmid genes of hb <dig> and hb <dig> may be responsible for thermophily  <cit>  may need reconsideration as sa- <dig> has dispensed with many of them.

the adaptability of sa- <dig>  and thermus in general, is highlighted by the extreme genome plasticity, loss of nonessential genes  and the acquisition of large islands subsequent to separation of sa- <dig> and thermus thermophilus, the most significant of these being island  <dig>  and the insert containing the "nitrate respiratory conjugative element". sa- <dig> also has a number of aerobic and anaerobic respiratory options, further highlighting its metabolic versatility and its ability to sustain itself under varying conditions.

the genome of thermus scotoductus sa- <dig> illustrates how rapid adaptation can be achieved by maintaining a highly dynamic and plastic genome. the possibility that it could sometimes be polyploid  <cit>  has not been investigated, but it would be surprising if this was not the case.
