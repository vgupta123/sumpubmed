BACKGROUND
males and females of most species show pronounced phenotypic differences and divergent life-history traits that are under antagonistic selection pressures. despite this, the majority of genes are shared between the sexes, which leads to strong sexual genetic correlations for many traits  <cit> . such genetic correlations can constrain the evolution of a trait towards a value that would be optimal for each sex, thus inhibiting the evolution of sexual dimorphism  <cit>  and causing sexual conflict . this conflict may prevent the sexes from maximizing their fitness  <cit> . the conflict may be resolved by the evolution of sexual dimorphism across different levels of ontogeny. in particular, sexual dimorphism can be mediated by sex-specific gene regulation, for example, through gene duplications, modifier genes, or dominance effects  <cit> . however, the evolution of sexual dimorphism may be constrained because many genes are likely to have pleiotropic effects and thus affect multiple traits simultaneously .

central aspects of sex-specific gene regulation remain poorly understood in many animals, including in the ancient insect order odonata . we conduct novel gene expression analyses in adult male and female ischnura elegans damselflies  to investigate sex differences in gene expression in general, and to identify transcripts of genes associated with pathways of potential importance for sexual development and sexual conflict in particular. ischnura elegans is an evolutionary and ecological model species because of its ancient taxonomic position  <cit> , the presence of a genetically controlled female-limited colour polymorphism  <cit> , and strong sexual conflict . it is also an emerging odonate genetic model species, with the most complete male-specific annotated transcriptome of any odonate to date  <cit> , a solid understanding of the inheritance of colour  <cit> , a linkage map  <cit>  and ongoing work to assemble the genome . however, given the lack of a reference genome, it is not currently possible to investigate specific expression patterns and dosage compensation of genes located on the sex chromosome  <cit> .

the colour polymorphism in i. elegans females  <cit>  is controlled by a mendelian locus with three alleles in a dominance hierarchy  <cit> . males are monomorphic in colour, whereas females occur in three different colour forms: the male-mimicking androchrome morph and the two more cryptic and female-like gynomorphs: infuscans and infuscans-obsoleta . the colour polymorphism is widespread in the family coenagrionidae, to which i. elegans belongs, and is described in more than  <dig> species  <cit> . several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of the colour polymorphism, including negative frequency-dependent selection driven by male harassment . the wide occurrence of the colour polymorphism among coenagrionid damselflies and its probable involvement in sexual conflict makes studying the differential gene expression in male and female damselflies a fascinating area of research .fig.  <dig> mating wheels of ischnura elegans. males  with each of the species’ three female morph types; a) the androchrome, male mimicking morph, b) the infuscans morph and c) the infuscans-obsoleta morph




in this study, we identify transcripts of genes involved in key developmental and functional pathways by utilising information gathered from the assembled and annotated transcriptome. this allows us to gain insights into biological processes at the molecular level of both sexes. we also conduct differential gene expression analyses between males and females, and between males and each of the female morphs, to help understand the regulation of physiological, morphological and behavioural differences between the sexes and to derive knowledge about the genes and pathways that are potentially involved in sexual conflict.

RESULTS
assembly and annotation
transcriptome sequencing
sequencing of mrna of  <dig> individuals generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end 100 bp reads ,  <dig> , <dig> reads from infuscans ,  <dig> , <dig> reads from infuscans-obsoleta females , and  <dig> , <dig> reads from males , respectively). after trimming of the adapters, low quality bases and removal of short reads, the total sequence set was reduced to  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads . a detailed summary of the raw reads and trimming step statistics can be found in the additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  all  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads obtained after trimming were used for the construction of the de novo transcriptome assembly.

de novo assembly and transcriptome assessment
the trimmed sequence reads from males and females were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts using the trinity software   <cit> . the assembled contigs had a minimum length of 200 bp, n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and an average contig length of 850 bp. to improve the quality of the de novo assembly, a three-step quality filtering method was employed. in the first step, the transcripts were clustered at 95% sequence similarity to reduce sequence redundancy. this step clustered  <dig> % transcripts together resulting in  <dig>  unique transcripts. in the second step, poor quality and potentially mis-assembled transcripts were removed by excluding transcripts that showed a mean per base coverage of less than  <dig>  after this step, a total of  <dig>  high quality transcripts were retained. finally,  <dig> transcripts containing ribosomal rna were removed from the transcriptome with repeatmasker  <cit> . the retained de novo transcriptome consisted of  <dig>  high quality transcripts, with a contig n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and an average contig length of  <dig>  bp. a detailed description of the initial and final assembly statistics can be found in additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence completeness of the transcriptome assembly was assessed with cegma   <cit> . out of  <dig> ultra-conserved core proteins  <dig> were identified as “complete”, giving the transcriptome a completeness score of  <dig> %. the remaining one was identified as “partial”. this indicates that the de novo assembly is almost complete, ensuring a high quality for all subsequent analyses.

transcriptome annotation
to annotate the assembly, all high quality transcripts were blasted against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database using blastx with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig> . a total of  <dig>   transcripts were reported to have at least one positive hit. putative conserved protein domains in the high quality assembled transcripts were identified using blast2go interproscan, and  <dig>   transcripts had at least one interproscan annotation  <cit> . the list of the  <dig> most abundant interpro domains is given in the additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  the blastx and interproscan annotated transcripts were subsequently annotated with gene ontology  terms into three major go categories: cell component, molecular function and biological processes. a total of  <dig>   transcripts were associated with at least one go term; concerning the second level ontology,  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to a cell component category,  <dig>  transcripts to a molecular function category and  <dig>  transcripts to a biological process category. a total of  <dig>  different enzymes were also identified using the kegg  database, and these enzymes were present in  <dig> different metabolic pathways.

quality of de novo assembly
trimming of the initial dataset from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> paired reads improved the overall dataset quality, resulting in a q <dig> value of 100% and a significant increase in the q30% . the initial de novo assembly consisted of  <dig>  transcripts with an n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp and an average contig length of 850 bp. the three-step quality filtering methods applied to enrich the transcriptome with high quality transcripts yielded  <dig>  transcripts having an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and an average contig length of  <dig>  bp. comparing the initial assembly with the final assembly showed that not only the redundancy of the assembly was decreased, but also that poor quality and potentially mis-assembled short transcripts were removed from the transcriptome. the cegma assembly completeness score yielded  <dig> %. hence, the de novo assembly appears to be of high quality  and quantity . in terms of functional capability, altogether  <dig>   of the transcripts could be associated with at least one annotation term.

differential gene expression between the sexes
number of differentially expressed transcripts and genes
differential expression analysis was performed between males  and all females , as well as between males and each of the three female morphs  separately, using deseq <dig>  <cit> . the level of sexual differential expression of the transcripts , and their significance , are listed in additional file 1: sheet 4– <dig>  and visualised in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

for the analyses, we extracted the most differentially expressed transcripts  between males and females . this yielded  <dig>  dets that represented  <dig>  differentially expressed genes . thus, some dets were isoforms of the same gene. among the  <dig>  dets,  <dig>  were up-regulated in females and  <dig> in males . the analyses between males and each of the three female morphs detected  <dig>  dets between androchrome females and males,  <dig>  dets between infuscans females and males, and  <dig>  dets between infuscans-obsoleta and males . interestingly, a higher proportion of dets were up-regulated in females than in males in the analyses of infuscans  and infuscans-obsoleta  than in the analysis of androchromes . this result suggests that male-mimicking androchrome females are more similar to males in their gene expression than are the two gynochrome morphs.fig.  <dig> sexual differential expression. histograms showing the number of differentially expressed transcript  between males and all females, and between males and each of the female morphs. red and blue bars refer to dets that are up-regulated in either females or males, respectively. data are given in additional file 1: sheet 8–11




we also performed blast2go enrichment analysis on selected dets which resulted in six enriched go terms between males and all females, five enriched go terms between males and androchrome females, four go terms between males and infuscans females, and one go terms between males and infuscans-obsoleta females. the complete list of enriched go terms is given in additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  the kegg biological pathways identified are reported in additional file 1: sheet  <dig> 

differentially expressed genes of specific interest
among the degs that were differentially expressed between males and females, we observed several genes that were associated with physiological and reproductive processes. for example, all analyses showed that the female morphs had a significant up-regulation of the vitellogenin gene ; a gene that produces vitellogenin protein, a precursor of lipoproteins and phosphoproteins involved in egg yolk production  <cit> . studies on honey bees have demonstrated that vitellogenin not only plays an important role in oogenesis, but also regulates various behavioural  and survival traits   <cit> . we also observed up-regulation of major royal jelly protein  <dig>  in all the female morphs . in apis mellifera, higher expression of mrjp <dig> in foragers than nurses suggested presence of some function in addition to regular brood food protein  <cit> . among the genes that were up-regulated in males, we found several genes encoding for sperm proteins, including the outer dense fibre protein  <dig>  low quality protein: spermatogenesis-associated protein 31d <dig>  and  <dig> kda sperm flagellar membrane proteins . these proteins are associated with the development of sperm tails, where they provide elasticity and protection from shear  <cit> . interestingly, up-regulation of opsins was also observed in males with respect to androchrome and infuscans female morphs . higher expression of opsins in males suggests that males have better adaptability to distinguish colours than females, which in turn may be advantageous for mate selection, guarding territories from rival males, and food hunting  <cit> . in the assembled transcriptome,  <dig> transcripts encoded for different types of transient receptor potential proteins . among them, five different types of trps were up-regulated in males with respect to different female morphs . while none of the trps were uniformly up-regulation in the female morphs. the generally higher expression of trps in males than females suggests a better capability of males to tolerate heat than females, as these receptors play an important role in thermal adaptations in insects  <cit> . moreover, we also found a male up-regulation of bric-a-brac 1-like  against infuscans and infuscans-obsoleta female morphs. the closest homologue for the gene comes from tribolium castaneum, where the associated protein is required for distal segmentation.fig.  <dig> heatmap of differentially expressed genes discussed in the manuscript . the log <dig> fold change-values from comparison between males and all females, and from males against each of the three female morphs, are indicated




because insects use olfaction for a variety of behaviours, including mate attraction, mate searching, oviposition site selection and the detection of host plant volatiles  <cit> , we looked specifically for olfactory genes in the assembled transcriptome. we identified several transcripts of odorant binding proteins , chemosensory proteins , odorant receptors  and ionotropic receptors  . among them, genes encoding for one odorant and two ionotropic receptors were up-regulated in female morphs, while one ionotropic and one olfactory receptor were up-regulated in males . olfactory receptors play an important role in sex pheromone and odour detection, and their up-regulation in male suggests an essential role in sex pheromone detection in females  <cit> . ionotropic receptors are ancient chemosensory receptors and respond to different odorants  <cit> . differential expression of the various ionotropic receptors in the sexes suggests different behavioural response to environmental volatiles, e.g. ionotropic receptor 76b helps in detection of low salts  <cit> . overall, our finding of several ors and irs with a sex-biased expression in the sexes of i. elegans indicates that they play important sex-specific roles in pheromone and odour detection, and that studying their biological functions in vivo and in vitro would present an interesting venue for future studies.

differential gene expression within specific pathways
differential gene expression in the ommochrome and melanin colour pathways
we have previously identified the melanin, pteridine and ommochrome colour pathways in i. elegans  <cit> . to further understand the mechanisms that lead to colour differences in the sexes, we examined the occurrence of sex-biased genes in these pathways. no degs were found in the pteridine pathway, while the ommochrome and melanin pathway showed evidence for differential expression between the sexes. in the ommochrome pathway, the cinnabar gene, coding for the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, was up-regulated in the two gynochrome morphs  . the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase controls the conversion of kynurenine into 3-hydroxykynurenine, which then enters into the pigment granules and undergoes oxidative condensation and forms ommins and ommatins  , suggesting a higher expression of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase and subsequently a higher accumulation of ommochrome pigments. higher accumulation of these ommochrome pigments likely contributes to the formation of various light and dark colour pigments in gynochromes females, which may in turn contribute to the colour differences seen among the trimorphic females and monomorphic males. ommatins have a low molecular weight and are alkaline labile compounds responsible for light colouration. ommins, however, have a high molecular weight and are alkaline stable compounds. mixtures of ommatins and ommins thus provide dark colours and shades in insects  <cit> . our findings corroborate other studies on insect showing an importance of ommochrome pigments in insect colouration and polymorphism. for example, the pink colour of schistocerca grasshoppers is due to a mixture of different ommochromes  <cit> . similarly, in odonates, red colour is caused by the presence of red and brown colour ommochromes, while blue colour is produced by a dark brown ommochrome background. finally, ontogenetic conversion of red dragonflies into yellow is caused by a redox-dependant colour change of ommochrome pigments  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ommochrome and melanin pigmentation pathway. substrates/products  and genes/enzymes  are given. differentially expressed genes/enzymes are represented with red colour boxes. a in the ommochrome pigmentation pathway, kynurenine  <dig> monooxygenase was up-regulated in the two gynochrome morphs . b in the melanin pathway, the yellow gene was uniformly up-regulated in all the female morphs 




we observed differential up-regulation of yellow genes  between the sexes . yellow protein was differentially up-regulated in all the female morphs, while protein yellow-like and yellow-e showed up-regulation in the males and the androchrome female morph . studies on drosophila spp. have suggested that changes in the expression of yellow gene correlate with different melanin patterns in the wings, abdomen and thorax  <cit> . yellow-e expression has been linked with pigmentation of bombyx spp. larvae head and tail spots  <cit> . in future studies it would be interesting to examine experimentally if yellow genes indeed contribute to the colour differences between the sexes in i. elegans.

in the present study, we also found expression of genes coding for lycopene cyclase phytoene synthase  and phytoene desaturase/phytoene dehydrogenase . this finding made it possible to identify the fourth colour pathway in i. elegans, the carotenoid pathway, which was not detected in our previous transcriptome study  <cit> . the biosynthesis pathway and annotation details are given in additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  carotene and xanthophyll, together constituting carotenoid pigments, are lipid soluble, containing no nitrogen and absorb light with green and blue wavelengths, which is producing a green, blue-green, blue and red colour to the insect integument and haemolymph  <cit> . carotenoids play an important role in antioxidation, photoreception and colouration  <cit> . however, none of the genes in this pathway were uniformly differentially expressed between the sexes.

sexual differential expression of the hormone biosynthesis pathway
insect hormones have long been studied due to their importance in physiology, development and behaviour  <cit> . several studies on insect hormones have pinpointed their role in  the regulation of muscle activity such as in myotropic peptides,  the regulation of reproduction, growth, and development,  the pheromone biosynthesis , diapause hormones, and  the stimulation or inhibition of tanning and of colour change . in the present study, we were able to identify two hormone biosynthesis pathways, namely the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway and the ecdysone hormone biosynthesis pathway. detailed annotations of genes and enzymes associated with these pathways are described in additional file 1: sheet  <dig>  however, the genes in the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway were not uniformly differentially expressed between the sexes  . genes in the ecdysone biosynthesis pathway  were, however, differentially expressed between sexes: cytochrome p <dig> 307a <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> 306a <dig> and cytochrome p <dig> 18a <dig> were up-regulated in females. the morph specific analyses between males and females showed that cytochrome p <dig> 307a <dig> was up-regulated in all female morphs, while cytochrome p <dig> 306a <dig> and cytochrome p <dig> cyp18a <dig> were up-regulated in the two gynochrome morphs . high expression of these enzymes leads to higher production of edysone and 20-edysone in adult females, suggesting their requirement in proper development of follicles and oogenesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ecdysone hormone biosynthesis pathway. substrates/products ﻿ and genes/enzymes  are given. differentially expressed genes/enzymes are represented with red colour boxes. cytochrome p <dig> 307a <dig> was uniformly up-regulated in all females  and in all female morphs, while cytochrome p <dig> 306a <dig> and cytochrome p <dig> cyp18a <dig> were up-regulated in the two gynochrome morphs 




females up-regulate the innate immune signalling pathway
the innate immune system acts as a first line of defence and protects hosts from a variety of foreign pathogens  <cit> . the four different types of innate immune signalling pathways recognised in insects are the  toll,  immune deficiency ,  janus kinase and the signal transducer and activator of transcription , and  prophenol-oxidase cascade. the toll immune pathway responds against gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections, while the imd pathway targets gram-negative bacteria, and the jak/stat pathway becomes activated in response to infection and injury by bacteria and viruses  <cit> . upon exposure to a specific infection, the corresponding insect peptidoglycan recognition proteins  are then activated, further triggering the signalling cascade  <cit> . apart from these three pathways, pgprs  also activate the prophenol-oxidase cascade. in the assembled transcriptome, we identified several genes of the four innate signalling pathways . in addition, we identified a total of  <dig> transcripts encoding different pgrps .fig.  <dig> the four different types of innate immune signalling pathways recognised in i. elegans. differentially expressed genes/proteins are represented with red colour boxes. a the toll immune pathway: exposure to bacterial and fungal peptidoglycans trigger the production of insect peptidoglycan recognition proteins , like pgrp-sa, pgrp-sc <dig> and pgrp-sd, which in co-operation with gram-negative binding proteins  like gnbp- <dig> and gnbp- <dig>  activates proteases spaetzle ; which in turn activates toll. activated toll activates dorsal and dif transcription factors, which then enter into the nucleus, bind to nfkb sites and initiate the transcription of antimicrobial peptides that kill gram-positive bacteria and fungi by degrading their cell walls. b in the imd pathway, exposure to meso-diaminopimelic acid  type peptidoglycan produced by gram-negative bacteria activates pgrp-le and pgrp-lc, which in turn activates imd. activated imd further activates fas-associated death domain  and death related ced-3/nedd2-like caspase , which then activates relish transcription factor. this enters into the nucleus and induce transcription of antimicrobial peptides detrimental for gram-negative bacteria. c jak/stat cytokine receptor activation caused by unpaired ligands released during infection and injury causes phosphorylation of jak tyrosine kinase hopscotch . the phosphorylated hop phosphorylate stat 92e, which then dissociate from receptor, dimerize, enters into the nucleus and induces transcription of thiosester-containing protein genes  and turandot  stress genes. d prophenol-oxidase cascades are triggered upon exposure to bacterial  and fungal  cell wall components. activation of cascade produces pgprs , which generate antimicrobial products like melanin and reactive oxygen species for defence. refer fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: sheet 8– <dig> for differential up-regulation components of immune system




peptidoglycan recognition protein  <dig> and peptidoglycan recognition protein long class  were among the most differentially up-regulated transcripts in all the female morphs. these proteins are usually activated in response to infection, but here their uniform up-regulation in all female samples indicates a general  up-regulation . apart from pgrp, we also observed female up-regulation of several other components of the innate immunity pathway, including prophenol oxidase activation factor, toll, protein toll-like and toll-like receptor  <dig>  the up-regulation of toll in the toll signalling pathway , pgrp-lc in the imd signalling pathway  and prophenol oxidase  in the prophenol oxidase signalling pathway suggest the presence of a stronger innate immune system response in females compared to males .

studies on the polymorphic damselfly species coenagrion puella have demonstrated that both sexes, as well as all three female morphs, are under equal pressure of parasitic infection  <cit> ; yet our results suggest that i. elegans females have activated their immune defence to a higher extent than males. in many other invertebrate species it is also observed that females invest more in immunity than males  <cit> . the difference in sex-specific immunity has been linked to bateman’s principle which states that females can gain greater fitness by investing into immunity defence systems to maximize their lifespan, as increased immunity increases longevity and consequently the time for egg production and oviposition  <cit> , whereas males gain greatest fitness by maximising their mating frequency with females. hence, our results suggest that female morphs of i. elegans may have a higher baseline immunity level than males possibly to maintain a longer reproductive life. moreover, it is also plausible that female i. elegans invest more in immune defence  as a consequence of the excessive male mating harassment that is common in this species  <cit> , and has been shown to cause injuries to females and expose females to toxins  and sexually transmitted diseases  <cit> .

the sex determination pathway: genes are expressed but not sex-biased
sex determination is an important biological phenomenon that initiates a cascade of effects that leads to sex dimorphism in morphology, physiology and behaviour  <cit> . in insects, sex determination has been extensively studied in drosophila spp.  <cit> . considering drosophila as a model organism, we were able to trace the sex determination pathway in i. elegans and identify all its components: runt, daughterless, deadpan, sex lethal , transformer- <dig> , doublesex , fruitless , fem and male-specific lethal  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes . however, with the exception of doublesex  none of these genes were differentially expressed between sexes. this was not surprising, since sex determination can often take place early during development and we have analysed exclusively adult i. elegans.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to characterize differential expression of genes in males and females of i. elegans. we successfully identified functionally important genes, pathways and processes involved in reproduction, olfaction, colouration, hormone and immune response and sex determination. these findings allow to gain insights into the phenotypic and behavioural differences between males and females. a main finding was the detection of sex-biased expression of several olfactory genes, which suggests that a sex-specific detection of pheromones, odours and behavioural responses to environmental volatiles is present. furthermore, an interesting finding was a female-bias in several important functional pathways. the ommochrome pigmentation pathway was up-regulated in gynomorphs females, indicating a prominence of ommochrome pigments  in the development of colour polymorphic females compared to the monomorphic males and the androchrome female morph. in addition, the hormone ecdysone biosynthesis pathway was female-biased, a finding that proposes a role of this pathway in the development of follicles and oogenesis. finally, the up-regulation of immunity genes in females suggests a stronger immune response in females than in males, potentially to protect them from a wide range of pathogens  and also to buffer them against injuries resulting from multiple matings. in this species, females are exposed to excessive male mating harassment that causes injuries to them and exposes them to toxins and sexually transmitted diseases. this study provides a foundation for future genomic and transcriptomic studies in i. elegans as well as in other odonate and invertebrate species.
