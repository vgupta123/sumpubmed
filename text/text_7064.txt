BACKGROUND
the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression occurs in the context of dna fibres compacted by interactions with proteins - the chromatin, where on the first level of compaction the dna is wrapped around a protein octamer composed of the four core histone proteins types h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> forming the nucleosome. this fibre becomes further compacted by the interaction with linker histone h <dig> and other proteins, forming a  <dig> nm fibre  <cit> . many archaea are known to possess histones, which most probably share common ancestry with the histone fold domains of eukaryotic h <dig> and h <dig>  short conserved segments  shared by many archaeal histones and eukaryotic h <dig> and h <dig> are illustrated in figure  <dig>  these archaeal histones interact with the genomic dna as tetrameric complexes  <cit> . in eukaryotes posttranslational modifications  at the n-termini of all histone types can alter the degree of chromatin compaction  <cit> . besides ptms the incorporation of histone variants into chromatin, particularly of histones h <dig> and h2a, seems to play a crucial role for the establishment of specific chromatin states. histone h <dig> has a globular c-terminal domain , which harbours four helix motifs . a putative recognition site for histone chaperones involved in nucleosome assembly partially overlaps with the Î±2-helix . most ptms are targeted to the unstructured n-terminus that protrudes from the nucleosome  <cit> . it seems to be a general eukaryotic feature that the unstructured n-terminal sequences of h <dig> are more divergent between species than the c-terminal globular domain.

chromatin modifying mechanisms play a superordinate role in the orchestration of developmental processes, thus influencing phenotypic differentiation. recent studies have also shown that some chromatin modifying mechanisms are responsive to environmental agents  <cit> , which hereby can act as triggers of gene expression. it is under controversial discussion whether some epigenetic features, which include ptms of histones and assembly of specific histone variants into discrete chromatin segments, contribute to epigenetic memory and may thus be inheritable over generations without genotypic changes  <cit> . accordingly epigenetic mechanisms possibly may affect natural selection and thus had influenced the diversification of eukaryotic life  <cit> .

however, the diversity of epigenetic mechanisms, their common themes as well as differences, and finally their potential impact to the evolution of eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. from all core histone types, variants of histone h <dig> with their dynamic posttranslational modifications have been most extensively studied in selected model organisms to date. in order to discover the evolutionary history of basal chromatin modifying mechanisms, we decided to undertake combined phylogenetic and molecular biological analyses focusing on variants of the core histone h <dig> and its ptm signature.

RESULTS
to date phylogenetic analyses of histone h <dig> variants were limited due to poor data availability of sequences from species representing putatively early branching eukaryotes. if not neglected totally parasitic organisms, such as entamoeba, were usually used to represent putatively early branching eukaryotic supergroups  <cit> . on the other hand multicellular organisms were often overrepresented in such analyses. the highly divergent h <dig> variants of some parasitic organisms usually led them to be placed at the basis of phylogenetic trees, whereas histone h <dig> family members of metazoa and plants often appeared as "crown group" members. although it was already known for decades that histone h <dig> is highly conserved in many eukaryotic species, the topology of such phylogenetic trees could be interpreted in a way that the ancestral eukaryotic histone h <dig> was highly divergent in comparison with h <dig> of "crown group" eukaryotes. however, we hypothesize that the placement of the divergent h <dig> variants of parasites near the root of such trees was an artifact due to long-branch attraction.

we therefore reinvestigated the phylogeny of histone h <dig> in the light of recent progress in understanding the tree of life and eukaryogenesis  <cit> . while some uncertainty about the position of the eukaryotic root remains , it appears that opisthokonts  and amoebozoa  diverged early from chromists and plants , resulting in a deep cleft between those eukaryotic supergroups and a multifurcated tree without "crown groups" . importantly, we found that the protein sequences of some histone h <dig> variants between selected species from unikonta and bikonta are remarkably invariant. to mention only two of multiple examples, histone h <dig> variant protein sequences between the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis  and arabidopsis thaliana  vary in only  <dig> out of  <dig> residues . similarly, histone h <dig> from nuclearia simplex  deviates in only  <dig> out of  <dig> residues from histone h <dig> in the green alga ostreococcus lucimarinus   . histone h <dig> variants ancestral to choanoflagellates and plants or nuclearids and green algae, respectively, consequently had most likely been very similar to these histone h <dig> variants. as a working hypothesis we therefore assumed, that this possibly could even be true for the h <dig>  of the last eukaryotic common ancestor .

highly conserved h <dig> variants occur even in putatively early branching eukaryotic clades
to test our working hypothesis we resampled histone h <dig> protein sequences from all eukaryotic supergroups   <cit>  using various databases from completely sequenced genomes or fragmentary est projects as sources . we focused on the identification of h <dig> sequences from non-parasitic organisms representing putatively early branching euglenozoa and excavata. importantly, we were able to assemble multiple new histone h <dig> sequences from various species of putatively early branching eukaryotes . we also obtained sequences of histone h <dig> variants from a ciliated protist, stylonychia lemnae . to our best knowledge the resulting dataset represents the most complete representation of histone h <dig> variant sequences available.

interestingly, we found extremely conserved histone h <dig> sequences and remarkable examples of divergent h <dig> variants in all eukaryotic supergroups , importantly also in non-parasitic euglenozoa and excavata. presuming an early divergence of unikonta and the plantae/chromista groups from excavata or euglenozoa, respectively, we assumed that the protoeukaryotic histone h <dig>  of leca must have been rather invariant from canonical histone h <dig> .

to strengthen this hypothesis we performed phylogenetic analyses using a combined histone fold dataset of h <dig> variants as well as cenh <dig> variants. these analyses typically resulted in tree topologies, where putative stem h <dig> variants occurred separated from divergent parasitic h <dig> variants  as well as cenh <dig> variants . a common ancestry of mammalian and avian cenp-a proteins  was supported by high bootstrap values. further a fungal cenph <dig> clade was well supported . however, since divergent h <dig> variants and other eukaryotic cenh <dig> s did not occur as monophyletic groups, proteins not characterized yet could not be assigned to a h3-like or cenh3-like function by their phylogenetic position. our analyses leave open whether a protocenh <dig> ancestral to all eukaryotic cenh <dig> s had existed or whether extant cenh <dig> s have multiple origins in eukaryotic evolution.

we next inferred h <dig> variant phylogenetic trees using a dataset of full-length protein sequences from which long branching h <dig> variants with uncertain position were eliminated . such sequences mostly represented parasitic species , which showed tendency to be positioned at the bottom of trees, including all characterized and putative cenh <dig> derivatives. although the bootstrap support for such unrooted trees was weak for numerous clades, the monophyly of many groups was well represented , whereas the monophyly of amoebozoa, chromista  and archaeplastidae could only weakly or not be resolved, probably due to the generally very high degree of h <dig> sequence similarity in those groups . as a global observation we discovered, that variations in h <dig> protein sequences often occurred within motifs involved in writing and reading the ptm signature as well as in the putative histone chaperone recognition domain .

histone h <dig> variants have evolved frequently, but independently in related species of almost all eukaryotic supergroups
differences between h <dig> variants recognized frequently involve the presence or absence of discrete putative phosphorylation sites , suggesting a cell cycle dependent regulation by phosphorylation of specific h <dig> variants. since phosphorylation of serine, or presumably also threonine, can prevent or even disrupt binding of effector proteins  at adjacent methylated lysine residues, it can be assumed that such sites could also function as switches regulating the chromatin signature  <cit> . the presence or absence of phosphorylation sites therefore suggests important non-redundant biological functions of such h <dig> variants.

our data suggest, that a variant similar to the replication-independent mammalian histone h <dig>  - but not the  h <dig>  - was likely ancestral to h <dig> variants of fungi and their sister group nuclearids as well as choanozoa and animals. in many metazoan species h <dig>  occurs with identical  or slightly different protein sequence . notably, in our phylogenetic analyses the only h <dig> from nuclearia simpex we could identify occurs near the root of the animal h <dig>  clade. this h <dig> -like variant deviates from human h <dig>  only in one substitution . in opisthokonta s <dig> occurs predominantly in fungal h <dig> variants , whereas a <dig> is found in animals, choanoflagellates and most sequences of amoebozoa. for example in two putative stem amoebozoa species a <dig> is found in a h <dig> variant of mastigamoeba balamuthi , whereas s <dig> is found in a  <dig> aa h <dig> sequence fragment of hyperamoeba dachnya . remarkably, s <dig> dominates in h <dig> variants of bikonta. we conclude that one or more h <dig> variants very similar to animal/nuclearid h <dig>  gave rise to all h <dig> variants found in extant opisthokonts.

deriving from an animal/nuclearid h <dig> s87-like precursor, we found identical homologs of histone h <dig>  in early branching animals, such as trichoplax adherens, suggesting that this replication-dependent h <dig> variant might have evolved early during metazoan evolution, as well as in organisms like drosophila, branchiostoma, xenopus, monodelphis, mouse and human. h <dig> , which only differs from h <dig>  insofar that h3s <dig> is replaced by h3c <dig>  as well as the testis-specific h <dig> t could only be found in mammals. these h <dig> variants most likely have a late origin in metazoan evolution. putative additional variants were also identified in some animals .

interestingly, in animals the highest number of h <dig> variants was identified in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus * . however, the occurrence of numerous h <dig> variants is not restricted to animals. our analyses strongly suggest that they have evolved frequently and independently in many eukaryotic taxa. for example, we characterized the macronuclear genomic sequences of at least  <dig> core histone h <dig> variants and one putative cenh <dig> variant  in the spirotrichous ciliate species stylonychia lemnae, which have been partially identified before by bernhard  <cit>  - to our best knowledge the highest number of h <dig> variants found so far in nature. interestingly, the main differences of these stylonychia h <dig> variants are within sequence motifs known to be involved in 'writing' or 'reading' the histone ptm signature, thus determining chromatin higher order structure . since spirotrichous ciliates like stylonychia exhibit enormous developmental reorganization of their genome during sexual reproduction, involving multiple epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> , it can be speculated that those h <dig> variants could play important roles in the regulation of these processes. to address this hypothesis experimentally we performed expression analyses of stylonychia lemnae histone h <dig> variants by pcr  and quantitative real-time pcr  using developmental stage specific cdna. notably, we were not able to faithfully distinguish the highly similar variants h3v <dig>  h3v <dig> and h3v <dig>  we therefore decided to treat h3v <dig>  h3v <dig> and h3v <dig> as equal. these experiments not only demonstrated that all h <dig> variants were expressed in a developmental stage specific manner, but also showed significant differences in their relative expression rates . interestingly, the expression of some variants  was pronounced during the first round of dna amplification in the course of macronuclear differentiation, while other variants were expressed at the onset of, or during the second round of dna amplification . the expression level of h3v <dig> appeared to increase or decrease in parallel to the dna content in macronuclear anlagen, respectively . although detailed experimental data about the biological relevance of each particular h <dig> variant in stylonychia is not yet available, their differential expression strongly suggests that they are functionally non-redundant. theoretically it can be ruled out to some extent that at least a sub-fraction of the h <dig> variant nanochromosomes encode non-functional proteins or represent pseudogenes, since programmed dna reorganization in spirotrichous ciliates involves a comparison between the germline  and the somatic  genomes resulting in a selection of macronucleus-destined sequences . in spirotrichous ciliates this genome comparison apparently involves a proof-reading template from the old macronucleus  <cit> , which can be rna  <cit> . we assume that such a proof-reading mechanism could generally and efficiently lead to the elimination of non-expressed nanochromosomes from the developing macronucleus.

examples of increased h <dig> variant numbers within related species could be found in almost all eukaryotic supergroups by our analyses  or by other researchers , for example in fungi , amoebozoa , plants , apicomplexa/chromista , heterokonta/chromista , also in excavates  and more divergent h <dig> variants in euglenozoa . since we could identify only one h <dig> sequence from a rhizaria species, we can make no statement for this group, whether h <dig> variants exist or not.

do derived h <dig> variants exist in dinoflagellates?
using nuclease digestion experiments and electron microscopic approaches it has been observed, that the most portion of chromatin in dinoflagellates is not organized into nucleosomal repeats  <cit> . in all dinoflagellates examined to date the dna:protein ratio within chromatin is very small . the protein fraction contains several basic histone-like proteins, which exhibit some similarities with both bacterial histone-like proteins and eukaryotic histone h <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, we found putative h <dig> variants in perkinsus marinus  as well as in the dinoflagellates pyrocystis lunula and karlodinium micrum . histone h <dig> of perkinsus marinus possesses several conserved motifs adjacent to lysines targeted by ptm in other eukaryotes , whereas k9/k <dig> motifs are absent in karlodinium micrum and pyrocystis lunula. furthermore the k <dig> motif lacks in pyrocystis lunula. since the pyrocystis h <dig> variant seems to be among numerous genes whose expression profiles are affected by oxidative stress  <cit> , evidence exist at least for this h <dig> variant at both the genomic and the transcriptional level.

remarkably, in perkinsus marinus we found also sequences encoding core histones h <dig> , h2a  and h2b  but no sequences homologous to other dinoflagellate histone-like proteins  <cit> , suggesting that the chromatin organization of this basal dinoflagellate  <cit>  relies on nucleosomes.

on closer look we could not identify further core histone types in the genomes of karlodinium micrum or pyrocystis lunula, whereas we found one h2a-family sequence fragment in another dinoflagellate, alexandrium tamarense . our observation suggests that these histone variants are the only core histone types involved in chromatin organization in these species, raising the question what could be the consequences on chromatin structure. without experimental evidence we can only speculate that in dinoflagellates like karlodinium micrum or pyrocystis lunula, which apparently do not possess a complete set of core histone types, h <dig> variants could be involved into chromatin organization of a fraction of the genome, similar to spermatozoa in many species, which replace most histones by protamines but retain nucleosomal chromatin organization at some genomic loci . it cannot be excluded that h <dig> variants interact with histone-like proteins. but realizing that the histone-fold domains of all four core histones are structurally very similar  <cit> , it also seems very plausible that the formation of h <dig> homodimers which possibly further assemble into tetramers and octamers is propagated.

however, the presence of all four core histone types in a basal dinoflagellate like perkinsus marinus and also the evidence for single core histone types in other species strongly support the view that the alternative chromatin organization in most representatives of that phylum is a derived, not an ancestral feature in dinoflagellate chromatin evolution.

divergent histone h <dig> variants from various supergroups represent a derived, not the ancestral state
due to the presence of conserved h <dig> variants with high similarity to animal/nuclearid h <dig> -like variants in selected species of all eukaryotic supergroups, it may be concluded that ancestral states are unlikely to be represented by the more divergent h <dig> variants in various supergroups. following these assumptions we deduced ancestral states for selected clades well supported in our phylogenetic analyses and subsequently a putative protoh <dig> sequence, which exhibits 87% sequence identity compared with human  h <dig>  , confirming our initial hypothesis, that protoh <dig> variant of leca were rather invariant from extant stem h3-like variants .

among the variable residues, three positions  alter between the aromatic amino acids tyrosine  or phenylalanine . the observed presence or absence of putative phosphorylation sites at various positions as a character state of many histone h <dig> variants is nicely confirmed by the reconstruction of ancestral h <dig> s of all supergroups as well as leca's protoh <dig> . it seems therefore reasonable to assume that multiple h <dig> variants could have had already evolved in leca. importantly, almost all lysines  are conserved in the reconstructed ancestral h <dig> sequences, with the notable deviation of k <dig> from euglenozoa and excavates, which alters between k and r  in chromists and plants and has evolved to r <dig> in opisthokonts and amoebozoa . interestingly, the number of n-terminal lysines in the divergent h <dig> variants of trypanosoma and leishmania is almost identical to canonical h <dig> .

at least a basal repertoir of histone h <dig> modyfing mechanisms shares common ancestry in all eukaryotes
as a consequence of this significant invariance of histone h <dig> in the course of eukaryotic evolution, where diverging h <dig> variants reflect a derived - not the ancestral state, conserved epigenetic mechanisms targeting histone h <dig> n-termini could be more widespread among eukaryotes than expected or even primarily inherent to all eukaryotes. to test whether selected ptms occur at conserved h <dig> n-termini  in h <dig> variants of presumably early branching eukaryotes, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy  and in some cases western analyses  using antibodies targeted to specific histone modifications, which tolerate slight alterations in adjacent amino acid motifs but are reported to faithfully recognize the respective ptm. we selected euglena gracilis  and trichomonas vaginalis  as representative species, since euglena histone h <dig> differs in only one amino acid  from human h <dig>   in the n-terminal  <dig> residues . although the n-terminal sequence identity in comparison with human h <dig>  does not exceed ~78% in two h <dig> variants of trichomonas vaginalis the overall similarity of these variants is higher than in other parasitic excavata/euglenozoa model systems, such as giardia, leishmania or trypanosoma. moreover motifs adjacent to k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> exhibit a high degree of conservation. importantly, we performed competition assays as controls as described in  <cit> . for comparison we monitored ptms in various nuclear types of the ciliate stylonychia lemnae, since antibodies used have been extensively tested in this single cell organism before  <cit> . we found multiple examples of ptms occurring in nuclei of both species, euglena gracilis as well as trichomonas vaginalis. histone h <dig> acetylation at k <dig> or k <dig>  which in stylonychia occurs in the transcriptionally highly active macronuclei , was detected in nuclei  of euglena and in most undistinguished stages observed in trichomonas. using antibodies targeted to h3k36ac, which in stylonychia is restricted to developing macronuclear anlagen , we could not detect this ptm in euglena, whereas signals were prominent in nuclei of most stages of trichomonas. h3k4me <dig> is mostly associated with transcriptional activity as highlighted by strong macronuclear signals in stylonychia macronuclei . this ptm was detected in nuclei  of euglena and many undistinguished stages of trichomonas. h <dig> methylated at k <dig> or k <dig> in the context of arks/t sequence motifs frequently propagates binding of heterochromatin binding protein  <dig> -like chromobox proteins, often resulting in heterochromatin formation. in stylonychia h3k27me <dig> occurs in the heterochromatic micronuclei , which are silent in gene expression. using an antibody which cross-reacts with h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> we observed nuclear signals corresponding to arkme3s/t in both euglena and trichomonas. the assumption that arkme3s/t within h <dig> tails could be involved in heterochromatin formation even in early branching eukaryotes is strengthened by the presence of numerous hp1-like chromodomain proteins encoded in the genomes of several representative species, with at least  <dig> chromodomain proteins being encoded in the genome of trichomonas vaginalis . chromodomain sequences of exemplary hp <dig> homologs shown in additional file  <dig> have formally the ability to bind arkme3s/t, as it might carefully be concluded from the conservation of  <dig> aromatic residues forming an "aromatic cage" in hp <dig>  which seems to be crucial for arkme3s/t binding  <cit> . at least a subfraction of these proteins possess the typical hp1-like domain organization with a n-terminal chromodomain, which usually contributes to the binding of arkme3s/t, and a c-terminal chromoshadowdomain, which is thought to be involved in heterochromatin spreading . besides other biological functions, the formation of condensed chromosomes during mitosis involves h3s10ph and/or h3s28ph in many organisms, as shown here for h3s28ph during micronuclear division  in stylonychia. we observed that h3s10ph also occurred in nuclei of euglena with a signal distribution reminiscent of condensed chromosomes, suggesting that this biological function may have a deep eukaryotic root. remarkably, the only euglena h <dig> variant recognized does not posses h3s <dig>  occasionally, h3s10ph or h3s28ph was also observed in nuclei of trichomonas. western analyses using antibodies targeted to h3k4me <dig> or h3k9ack14ac revealed a h3-sized protein band , whereas other antibodies used in microscopy failed to detect linearized proteins immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane.

remarkably, multiple ptms at specific sites have also been identified in the divergent core histone types of trypanosoma brucei  <cit> . thus our analyses contribute to the view that numerous ptms occur in various excavata and euglenozoa. with regard to the very high degree of h <dig> protein sequence similarity and multiple conserved ptms found, especially in non-parasitic euglena gracilis, it seems likely that major chromatin modifying mechanisms evolved early during eukaryogenesis, possibly directly accompanying the acquisition of the nucleus, the invasive accumulation of genomic non-coding dna and the organization of the genome into chromosomes. we therefore speculate that such conserved epigenetic mechanisms, if inheritable, may have had substantially contributed to the adaptation of organisms to environmental changes and consequently to the diversification of eukaryotic life. however, conflicting with this speculation, the very basic problem remains unsolved, whether a genomic feedback on epigenetic manifestations leading to genome encoded epigenetic signatures is obligatory, or whether a long-term genome-independent persistence of epigenetic signatures over many generations exists.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple histone h <dig> variants evolved frequently but independently within related species of almost all eukaryotic supergroups, whereby the presence of numerous variants in rhizaria could not be shown due to the limited sequence data. remarkably, we found at least  <dig> histone h <dig> variants in the spirotrichous ciliate stylonychia lemnae, which are expressed in a developmental stage specific manner, but also show significant differences in their relative expression rates.

interestingly, although it has been reported that dinoflagellate chromatin is not organized into nucleosomes, we found that the genome of the basal dinoflagellate species perkinsus marinus encodes all four core histone types suggesting a "classical" nucleosome-based type of chromatin organization. moreover we found h <dig> variants encoded in the genomes of at least two other dinoflagellate species. a recurring theme in variants of histone h <dig> in almost all eukaryotic supergroups is the presence or absence, respectively, of discrete putative phorsphorylation sites.

our data confirm that an animal/nuclearid-like histone h <dig>  variant was very likely ancestral to h <dig> variants of all opisthokonts. h <dig>  and h <dig>  as well as h <dig> t are derivatives of h <dig> , whereas h <dig>  evolved already in early branching animals, such as trichoplax. we found no evidence for h <dig>  and h <dig> t outside of mammals. the earlier observed numerical increase of particular h <dig> variants towards mammalian evolution  <cit>  is biased, since some "lower" eukaryotes have similar or even higher numbers of h <dig> variants.

our study confirms that protoh <dig> of leca most probably was rather invariant from stem h <dig> variants, showing that grouping of divergent h <dig> variants from mostly parasitic representatives of putatively early branching eukaryotes close to the eukaryotic root is an artifact. these h <dig> variants represent derived states rather than being ancestral.

at least a basal repertoire of chromatin modifying mechanisms must share a conserved common ancestry and thus be inherent to all eukaryotes, as shown by the presence of various ptms on h <dig> tails in selected species with conserved h <dig> sequences representing putatively early branching eukayotic clades.
