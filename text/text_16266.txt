BACKGROUND
dysferlinopathies are a group of autosomal recessive inherited late onset progressive muscular dystrophies caused by malfunction of dysferlin protein. mutations in the dysferlin protein cause three phenotypes called limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2b  <cit> , miyoshi myopathy  <cit> , and distal anterior compartment myopathy  <cit> . dysferlin is not a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, but its function is linked with calcium-activated membrane repair caused by fusing aggregated intracellular vesicles with the sarcolemma at the site of injury  <cit> . the mechanism of membrane repair is not yet determined in detail and the specific role of dysferlin needs to be defined at the structural level.

dysferlin, a member of the ferlin protein family, is a type ii anchored membrane protein with a single c terminal helix buried in the membrane. ferlin proteins are defined as containing four or more c <dig> domains and a c terminal trans-membrane helix. there are  <dig> ferlin proteins expressed in human; dysferlin, myoferlin, otoferlin, fer1l <dig>  fer1l <dig>  and fer1l <dig>  <cit> . myoferlin is the most similar paralogue to dysferlin. both proteins are predicted to have the same domain composition with overall sequence identity of 56%. dysferlin is expressed in most tissues but is found in abundance in skeletal muscle, heart, brain and placenta.

the multiple domain architecture of dysferlin was analysed by a combination of gene3d  <cit> , smart  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  domain family resources. the domain architecture is predicted to consist of seven c <dig> domains , three fer domains , two dysf domains, one nested inside the other, and a c terminal trans-membrane domain . c <dig> domains are found in hundreds of proteins and many are known to bind to phospholipids or proteins, often in a calcium dependent manner  <cit> . in dysferlin and myoferlin c2a binds to phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner.  <cit> . the other c <dig> domains do not show calcium-dependent binding to lipids, but do show some calcium independent binding to phospholipids  <cit> . the other c <dig> domains are believed to interact with dysferlin binding proteins or to be involved in dimerisation  <cit> . recently it has been shown that there is a minor variant of the dysferlin c2a domain, c2av <dig>  that does not bind via calcium  <cit> . crystal structures of the canonical and variant structures of c2a show conservation of structure, even where the sequence is not conserved. biophysical characterisation of the interactions with phospholipids and calcium indicate that the c2a and c2av <dig> domains are highly conformationally flexible  <cit> . the fer domains  are short conserved regions found only in the ferlin protein family and are not yet shown to be folded domains.

dysferlinopathy causing mutations are dispersed throughout the length of the protein, but many fall in the dysf domains  <cit> . one dysf domain is inserted into the other dysf domain, by gene duplication, forming an inner dysf domain and a two part  outer dysf domain  <cit> . the function of the dysf domain is unknown. the human myoferlin  inner dysf domain structure was solved by nuclear magenetic resonance  and showed a novel fold. this consists of two long beta strands connected by a long loop that caps the sheet edges in certain sections  <cit> . the structure contains arginine/tryptophan stacks that holds the fold together and are largely conserved throughout dysf domain sequences .

in this study, we have determined the three dimensional structure of human dysferlin inner dysf domain by x-ray crystallography at  <dig>  Å. this is the first dysf domain crystal structure.

RESULTS
structure characterisation
the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the nmr structure of the inner dysf of myoferlin  <cit> . the sequence identity between the inner dysf domain in dysferlin and myoferlin is 61% . most datasets that were collected, processed and refined in space group p <dig> , with the best resolution dataset diffracting to  <dig>  Å. a single dataset was collected in a different space group p <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. the crystal packing is almost the same in the two forms, but the distortions of the perfect cube in the orthorhombic structure means the monomers of the crystallographic trimer in the cubic crystals are no longer identical . this leads to some of the flexible regions  being more visible in some chains with the orthorhombic data. except where stated otherwise the analysis is based on the single chain in the  <dig>  Å structure. statistics for both datasets are summarised in table  <dig> and have been deposited in the protein data bank .

the inner dysf domain construct starts at residue met <dig> and ends at gln <dig> and has a ser on the n terminus from the tev protease site. the additional ser, met <dig> and gln <dig> are not visible in the structures. the main secondary structure consists of two long antiparallel β-strands, one at each terminus . these β-strands are connected with a long loop . the loop caps the edge of the n terminal β-strand with main chain hydrogen bonds from residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the c terminal β-strand is capped with main chain hydrogen bonds from residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these give short β strands within the linking loop. there is also a single turn of  <dig> helix from  <dig> to  <dig> . this secondary structure is also conserved in the nmr structure of the myoferlin inner dsyf domain  <cit> .

the structure is highly conserved between independent copies in the crystals. the crystallographic trimer of the p <dig> crystal superimposes onto the trimer in the p <dig> asymmetric unit with an rmsd calpha of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> residues of the trimer. the four individual chains from the two assymetric units superimpose no worse than  <dig>  Å calpha rmsd over  <dig> residues for any pair. the conservation with the nmr structure of myoferlin is also extremely high with a calpha rmsd of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> residues being the worst and  <dig>  Å over  <dig> residues being the best of the  <dig> models . the biggest variation between dysferlin models is between  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> . these are also the regions with the highest temperature  factors in dysferlin, the regions with the largest rms between nmr models in myoferlin, as can be seen from the cing database  <cit> , and the regions that differ most between dysferlin and myoferlin. however the region from 958- <dig> also has high b factors, while conserving the backbone trace between structures quite well.

the trimer  is predicted to be the stable assembly by pdbepisa  <cit> . formation of the assembly buries a total 5250 Å <dig>  the interface between the protein chains  forms  <dig> -  <dig> hydrogen bonds and  <dig> salt bridges. three of these are mainchain-mainchain, with β <dig> forming intermolecular β strand links to β <dig> as well as the intramolecular h bonds to β <dig>  2 h bonds are mainchain-sidechain and the others are sidechain-sidechain. indeed the formation of β <dig> is probably driven by the trimerisation. the relatively low b factor in this side of the loop may be partially caused by this packing. we have no evidence from gel filtration or nmr spectroscopy  for the existence of a trimer, nor is there any likely way to invoke a trimer in vivo. there are two dysf domains in dysferlin and the reported oligomeric state of the full length protein is a dimer. therefore two or four dysf domains seems more likely higher order assemblies, although extending the beta sheet either with other dysf domains or other proteins does seem to be a likely method of interaction.

arginine/tryptophan  stacks
as reported for the myoferlin inner dysf domain  <cit> , the dysferlin dysf domain is held together by arginine/aromatic sidechain stacking. superficially there is a stack of arginines and tryptophans which runs the entire length of one face of the beta sheet, and a single small group on the other face . however, at the good resolution of these crystal structures, we can give a much confident description of the exact nature of the interactions. in particular arginines can interact with aromatics either in a stacked   <cit>  or in an h bond . theoretical calculations favour the h bond arrangement in vacuum but the stacked arrangement in water  <cit> . we do see both these types of interaction but a number of the arginine-guanadinium groups do not lie above the centre of aromatic ring. in fact the atlas of sidechain interactions  <cit> , does not have the arg –trp pairs above the centre of the ring in most of the clusters. only one cluster lies above the  <dig> membered ring. in four of the six cases the guanadiniums lie above or beyond the ne-cz containing edge of the ring and in one case beyond the opposite edge of the indole. in these cases there is still a hydrophobic interaction of the aliphatic sidechain with the ring and the guanadinium is available to form other h-bonds. a working definition of aliphatic stacking is that at least two side chain atoms are within  <dig>  Å of trp ring atoms .

the details of the r/w interactions are laid out in table  <dig> and examples shown in figure  <dig>  the analysis shows that in fact there is not one continuous stack, but three on one face of the sheet. r <dig> is to one side of w <dig>  with only one non-h atom within  <dig>  Å. instead cys <dig> forms an aromatic h bond interaction with w <dig>  the second break occurs between, r <dig> and w <dig>  where both side chains hydrogen bond to e <dig>  but there is no direct interaction between the two. on the other face r <dig> stacks with both f <dig> and w <dig>  most but not all the stacking interactions are conserved in the myoferlin inner domain, but the nmr structure does not define which mode of packing is taking place. by sequence homology most of these interactions would be found in the dysferlin outer dysf domain . the inner dysf domain of myoferlin lacks equivalents of k <dig> and w <dig>  although the overall fold is well conserved; conversely the outer dysferlin dysf domain lacks an equivalent of c <dig> and r <dig>  so in both cases the stacks will be a bit shorter.

dysferlinopathy mutations
there are  <dig> missense mutations in the inner dysferlin domain reported in the leiden dysferlin mutation database  <cit> . these are summarised in table  <dig> which summarises the position. figure  <dig> shows position of all the point mutations and close up views of the three most reported mutations. the three most frequent mutations disrupt the r/w stacks and are likely to lead to a less stable or possibly unfolded domain. the unfolded domain may lead to degradation of the entire dysferlin protein. it is also notable that there are several surface residues mutated, although in this very flat domain nearly every residue contributes to the surface, which may indicate that the dysf domain is involved in protein-protein interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of the inner dysf domain of dysferlin confirms the unusual fold of this domain first seen in the myoferlin homologue. the high resolution of the structure allows detailed analysis of the interactions forming the r/w stacking seen in this domain. it also provides a better model for understanding the disease causing point mutations in this domain seen in dysferlin patients. the most common mutations will disrupt the r/w stacking, making the domain more unstable or inherently unfolded, probably enhancing the degradation of the protein. some of the dysferlin mutants map to the surface, implying that protein-protein interactions may have a role in the function of this domain.
