BACKGROUND
according to the network theory of niels jerne, the immune system is a network of interacting idiotypes that is involved in the regulation of immune responses  <cit> . anti-idiotypic  antibodies are a special set of antibodies that can react with idiotopes, which represent unique antigenic determinants on the surface of an antibody. each antibody constitutes a small set of idiotopes that form its own idiotype. private idiotopes have been shown to be associated with the complementarity-determining regions , which, in addition to various rearrangements of v--j gene segments, also reflect random somatic mutations and/or n-region additions with a low probability of repetition in another individual. unlike private idiotopes, recurrent idiotopes are encoded by germline genes, which can generally tolerate some somatic mutations without the loss of the original idiotope  <cit> . a single idiotope can stretch over a part of the cdr and a part of the framework region, as well as over both the light and heavy chain residues.

ab <dig> antibodies can be classified into three distinct groups: the ab2α antibody group are conventional antibodies that recognize idiotopes distinct from the antigen-combining site on primary ab <dig> antibodies; ab2β antibodies are internal image antibodies that recognize epitopes within the antigen-combining site and that resemble the nominal antigen ; and ab2γ antibodies recognize epitopes within the antigen-combining site, but do not resemble the nominal antigen  <cit> .

the most intriguing group of ab <dig> antibodies are those of ab2β, the internal image antibodies, which are directed against the binding site of the eliciting antibodies and can, in their paratope, structurally and/or functionally mimic the original antigen, or more precisely, the epitope of the original antigen  <cit> . this feature has led to the idea of using internal image antibodies as surrogate antigens for the development of active vaccines. such an approach is especially useful when the hypothetically protective antigens are infectious, toxic or difficult to isolate and purify, as is the case in prion disease vaccine development.

prion diseases, which are also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , are a group of incurable, fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals  <cit> . according to the widely accepted "protein only" hypothesis proposed by stanley b. prusiner, tses are caused by misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein  into the protease-resistant isoform, prpsc, which then accumulates in the central nervous system  <cit> . since the epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in the nineties and the transmission of the disease to humans as variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease   <cit> , significant scientific resources have been devoted to improve our understanding of prion biology. interestingly, to date, it has not been possible to detect a significant anti-prpsc immune response during the course of prion diseases  <cit> . similar difficulties emerge with attempts to experimentally evoke a protective anti-prpsc immune response in wild-type animals, when the recombinant prion protein or peptides derived from the amino-acid structure of the prion protein are used as antigens for immunization  <cit> . since the prion protein is a highly conserved ubiquitous protein, it induces strong b-cell and t-cell immune tolerance when introduced into an organism  <cit> .

as an alternative to conventional active anti-prion vaccine development, the ab <dig> approach offers another way to overcome the unresponsiveness of the immune system. for the development of ab <dig> antibodies that mimic the prpsc-specific epitope, a prpsc-specific antibody is a prerequisite. in our previous studies, we described and characterized v5b <dig>  a prpsc-specific monoclonal antibody, and indicated its potential applicability for diagnostic purposes  <cit> . based on biophysical studies, it has been proposed that v5b <dig> recognizes an epitope on prpsc that is similar or identical to the conformation of the p <dig> peptide in solution  and in fibril-like aggregates, both of which differ from the conformation of the corresponding region in prpc  <cit> .

according to the internal image phenomena, ab2β antibodies against the v5b <dig> paratope would carry the prpsc-specific epitope image in their antigen-combining site, thereby providing an insight into its structure and maybe even serving as a tool for idiotypic vaccine studies.

the aim of this study was thus to investigate the applicable ways to induce an anti-idiotypic response to the prpsc-specific monoclonal antibody in xenogeneic and syngeneic experimental systems, and to define the preparation of ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies with well-defined strategies for immunization, selection and subsequent characterization.

RESULTS
to evoke an immune response against the idiotype of the mouse v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody, two different models of experimental immunization were set up: the xenogeneic and syngeneic experimental systems.

anti-idiotypic response in chickens
in the xenogeneic experimental model, the chickens were immunized with the mouse v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody. the humoral immune response was monitored by detection of antigen specific igy in the immune sera after the 3rd immunization by elisa . in particular, the od <dig> values were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at the 100-,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold dilutions, respectively. hardly any signal could be detected at dilutions ≥  <dig> -fold . since our specific interest was restricted to ab <dig> antibodies only, the competition between chicken ab <dig> antibodies and the original antigen, the p <dig> peptide, for binding to the paratope of the v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody offered an insight into the ab <dig> humoral response . the two chickens with sera that exhibited the highest inhibition were further immunized, although this time with the fab fragment of v5b <dig>  to induce proliferation of fab v5b2-specific b-cell clones only. unfortunately, none of the resulting hybridoma cell clones maintained specific igy production . to better characterize the potent polyclonal immune response against the idiotype region, the fab v5b <dig> specific antibodies were purified from the chicken blood sera. as shown in fig 1c, the ch <dig> immunoaffinity-purified polyclonal ab <dig> antibodies had an inhibitory capacity of 100% when used at the concentration of only  <dig> μg/ml, whereas it declined to around 10% at the concentration of  <dig>  ng/ml.

anti-idiotypic response in syngeneic mice
in the second experimental model, syngeneic balb/c mice were challenged with three different forms of the same igg <dig> molecule: the whole v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody, the fab fragment of v5b <dig>  and the fab fragment of v5b <dig> covalently coupled to the highly immunogenic carrier molecule klh. ten days after the 3rd immunization, blood was taken from the tail vein and the sera were tested for specific antibodies by indirect elisa, and for ab <dig> antibodies by competitive elisa, as shown in fig  <dig>  the mean od <dig> values at a 1: <dig> dilution were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for sera of mice immunized with v5b <dig>  fab v5b <dig> and fab v5b2-klh, respectively. the anti-v5b <dig> sera values declined faster with further dilutions, as compared to the anti-fab v5b <dig> and anti-fab v5b2-klh sera, for which the od405values were still  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, at a dilution 1: <dig> . in agreement with these data, the most potent binding inhibition of v5b <dig> to the p <dig> peptide in elisa was seen with the anti-fab v5b <dig> and anti-fab v5b2-klh sera. more than 90% inhibition was reached with the anti-fab v5b <dig> and anti-fab v5b2-klh sera diluted to 1: <dig> , and more than 50% inhibition with these sera diluted 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> , respectively. since the highest immune response against fab v5b <dig> and the strongest competition of ab <dig> antibodies in immune sera were seen in mice immunized with fab v5b <dig>  the two mice with the highest anti-fab v5b <dig> antibody titres were chosen and sacrificed for the cell fusion. in addition, the mouse with the highest anti-fab v5b <dig> titre from the group of mice immunized with fab v5b2-klh was also selected for the cell fusion.

ab <dig> monoclonal antibody selection
the selection of murine ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies was designed as a two-step process, including positive and negative selection. in the positive selection step, only hybridoma lines that reacted with fab v5b <dig> in elisa were selected for further characterization, whereas in the following negative selection step, only cell lines that did not bind to any of the negative selection proteins  were chosen. in particular, the first protein used for negative selection was the fab fragment from the e12/ <dig> anti-recombinant bovine prion protein monoclonal antibody  <cit> , which has a different epitope specificity but is of the same isotype as v5b <dig>  this served to eliminate hypothetical isotype-specific antibodies that recognize the ch <dig> domain, the first constant domain, in addition to the variable domain that was also present in the fab fragment. all of the further proteins used for negative selection were fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies directed against the same p <dig> peptide as v5b <dig>  <cit> . these antibodies differ from v5b <dig> either in terms of their prion protein isoform specificities or other binding properties, as summarized in table  <dig> 

recboprp, recombinant bovine prion protein; huprp, human prion protein

the nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of the variable domains of both the light and heavy chains of the anti-p <dig> antibodies were determined in our previous studies . to compare not only their specificity, but also their structural determinants, the amino-acid identities and similarities between the variable regions of v5b <dig> and other anti-p <dig> monoclonal antibodies that were used for negative selection were examined. according to the identity and similarity matrices, the closest resemblance of vl and vh of v5b <dig> were seen with the c1/ <dig> and k4h <dig> monoclonal antibodies. in particular, the vl of c1/ <dig> was 85% identical and 91% similar to the vl of v5b <dig> and the vh of k4h <dig> was 90% identical and 93% similar to the vh of v5b <dig>  with respect to the primary protein structures. the differences between these antibodies were predominantly restricted to the cdr regions only, as indicated by the frequencies of non-conserved substitutions  and insertions and deletions  inside and outside these regions . still, all selected ab <dig> antibodies exclusively recognize fab v5b <dig> .

amino-acid identities and similarities between the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody, in comparison to the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the other monoclonal antibodies used for negative selection. the amino-acid identities and similarities were calculated using the blosum <dig> matrix.

in all,  <dig> hybridoma cell lines that were obtained in four cell fusions produced antibodies that reacted with fab v5b <dig>  although only five hybridoma cell lines corresponded to our strict selection criteria, all of which originated from mice immunized with the fab fragment of v5b <dig> . according to the binding affinities and the capacity to inhibit the binding of v5b <dig> to the p <dig> peptide in elisa, the two most potent ab <dig> antibodies  are further described here. these selected ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies had high affinities for fab v5b <dig> in indirect elisa. the kaff determined were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> for 5d <dig> and 4f <dig>  respectively.

ab <dig> competition studies
further characterization of the ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies in terms of competitive studies showed concentration-dependent inhibition of v5b <dig> binding to the p <dig> peptide, with over 55% and over 35% inhibition in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml 5d <dig> and 4f <dig>  respectively. the isotype control 6c <dig> monoclonal antibody did not cause any significant inhibition over a wide range of concentrations .

since the p <dig> peptide is only a mimic of the prpsc-specific epitope on the prpsc molecule, and since the final target is the prpsc molecule itself, we wanted to determine whether ab <dig> antibodies can inhibit the binding of v5b <dig> to prpsc directly in immunohistochemistry of brain slices of a scjd affected individual. fig  <dig> shows the results of immunohistochemical staining in the presence of different competitor molecules through representative photomicrographs of labelled tissue sections  and in a graphical form .

preincubation of v5b <dig> with its original antigen, the p <dig> peptide , resulted in a 92% reduction in the signal relative to the positive control , while the scrambled p <dig> peptide  at the same concentration  caused a statistically non-significant decrease in comparison to the positive control. preincubating v5b <dig> with the 5d <dig> and 4f <dig> ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies at  <dig> μg/ml resulted in a 90% and 50% drop in the signal, respectively. both of these effects were statistically significant . a  <dig> μg/ml concentration of 5d <dig> still caused a significant, 52% drop in signal, whereas further dilution of 5d <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml had a lesser effect, reducing the signal by 39%, which did not reach statistical significance. the isotype negative control antibody at  <dig> μg/ml again produced a statistically non-significant effect compared to the positive control. all three concentrations of the purified ch <dig> chicken polyclonal ab  caused large and highly significant  signal decreases, of 88%, 84% and 81%, relative to the positive control.

sequencing of anti-idiotypic antibodies and 5d12-v5b <dig> molecular docking
the nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of vh and vl were determined . according to the results of the competitive studies, 5d <dig> was chosen as the most promising monoclonal ab <dig> and its interaction with v5b <dig> was further characterized with molecular docking.

the patchdock algorithm generated  <dig> matches between the 5d <dig> and v5b <dig> models based on their surface complementarity. the  <dig> best solutions were further refined and scored using the firedock algorithm. in the solution that shows the best surface complementarity, the molecular interface between 5d <dig> and v5b <dig> was formed by the cdr regions of both models . at the same time, this orientation had the 3rd lowest global energy of all the matches scored using firedock. the two solutions with the lower global energy only ranked 37th and 34th with respect to the complementarity and both proposed binding to the c-terminal face of the v5b <dig> model. as this surface is an artifact of the model, which contains only variable regions of both chains, and is not exposed in the entire mab or fab fragment, these two solutions were discarded as irrelevant.

the amino-acid residues that form the 5d12-v5b <dig> contact interface were identified as the ones, in which any atom of the residue is separated from any binding partner atom by a distance ≤  <dig> Å. for both binding partners the majority of the contact residues were found to be located in the cdr loops: 19/ <dig> and 18/ <dig> contact residues in the case of 5d <dig> and of v5b <dig>  respectively . with the exception of cdr-l <dig>  all cdr loops from 5d <dig> contributed to the 5d12-v5b <dig> binding surface.

the comparison of the p <dig> peptide sequence  and the 5d <dig> interacting surface residues revealed several similarities. the centre of the 5d <dig> interface is composed of aromatic residues, especially tyr, which correspond to the c-terminal tyr-try motif of the p <dig> peptide. in addition the polar ser and thr residues, separated from the tyr patch by an asn residue resemble the ser-gln motif in the p <dig> peptide sequence .

discussion
over the past decade, the anti-idiotypic vaccine approach has been successfully used for various aspects of vaccinology, such as autoimmune diseases, enteric intoxification, rejection of allografts, allergic diseases, foetal immunity regulation, and in particular, tumour immunotherapy  <cit> . this is the method of choice when the surrogate protective antigens are carbohydrate moieties or glycoproteins, when protective antigens are difficult to isolate and purify, when synthetic peptides cannot form the tertiary structure present in protective antigens, and when infectious agents with unpredictable effects are used  <cit> . some of the properties listed also hold true for the pathological form of the prion protein. induction of protective anti-prion immune response in wild type animals is extremely difficult, because of the host tolerance to endogenous prpc . to date, no entirely successful attempt of active immunization in the field of tse has been published, although some hypothetically protective target sites on the prion protein have been proposed  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, no method has been widely accepted. anti-idiotypic vaccines would therefore represent a novel approach for prion disease prevention and treatment.

results of passive vaccination and cell-culture studies indicate that only monoclonal antibodies that bind to the membrane prpc are efficient in blocking prion propagation and pathogenesis  <cit> ; at the same time, it has been shown that monoclonal antibodies that recognized both prpc and prpsc, blocked prpsc accumulation in vitro even more efficiently than monoclonal antibodies specific for prpc only  <cit> . however, the cross-linking of prpc in vivo caused extensive neuronal damage  <cit>  and in our opinion this finding needs to be noted when potent prpc-specific antibodies are to be induced or introduced for treatment or prophylaxis purposes. therefore an approach to exclusively target prpsc would avoid all of the problems regarding the binding of antibodies to prpc and the resultant cessation of normal prpc function.

to directly target the pathological isoform in the development of an anti-idiotypic vaccine, a prpsc-specific antibody is a prerequisite. however, only a few prpsc-specific antibodies have been reported  <cit> , and due to their individual characteristics, not all of them are suitable for this purpose.

the v5b <dig> monoclonal antibody that was previously described by our group is a potent prpsc-specific antibody that reacts with the native prpsc deposits in immunohistochemistry  <cit> . this thus represents an appropriate candidate to preserve the information of the native prpsc-specific epitope in its antibody-combining site. in the present study, the main ways of producing ab <dig> antibodies against the prpsc-specific antibody have been studied in two experimental models: in xenogeneic and syngeneic systems.

mammalian proteins are highly immunogenic in chickens. as expected for xenogeneic immunization, the antibody titre in the antiserum was high. although the immune response was expected against the whole immunoglobulin molecule, anti-idiotypic response was surprisingly potent, with the ability to totally block the binding of v5b <dig> to the p <dig> peptide or prpsc. however, despite promising results after testing the immune sera and affinity purified ab <dig> igy antibodies, we were not able to isolate stable chicken hybridoma cell lines that retained the antibody production. the main reason appears to be that to date chicken hybridoma technology has been poorly studied in comparison to mouse hybridoma technology; the system therefore still needs to be optimized for use as a routine experimental procedure.

in our syngeneic studies, the antigen  was actually a self-protein, produced in a balb/c mouse and injected into an inbred balb/c mouse with virtually the same genetic background, and therefore self-tolerance to the whole constant part of the immunoglobulin was expected. groups of balb/c mice were immunized with  <dig> different forms of the same antigen. whole igg v5b <dig> was the original and the least chemically treated molecule used for immunization. it is a relatively large molecule, predominantly composed of the self constant region, with only a minor part being immunogenic in a syngeneic experimental system. although the immune tolerance to the whole constant part of the immunoglobulin molecule was expected, we also wanted to assess whether the use of the smaller fragment fab v5b <dig>  lacking the constant fc-region, potentiates the immune response to idiotopes. in addition to the whole v5b <dig> and fab v5b <dig>  the fab v5b <dig>  covalently coupled to the highly immunogenic carrier molecule klh, was used for immunization, to maximize the specific helper t-cell response and to potentiate the immune response against idiotopes on v5b <dig>  nevertheless, a prominent immune response was achieved with all three antigens. surprisingly, even though the immune response against the whole igg v5b <dig> was relatively strong, the antisera capacity to inhibit the v5b <dig> binding to the p <dig> peptide was much lower in comparison to the inhibitory capacity of the antisera obtained by immunization with the smaller fragment, fab v5b <dig>  because of the higher molecular weight of the whole igg v5b <dig> in comparison to the fab v5b <dig>  less idiotopes of v5b <dig> are present per μg of antigen injected in case of the whole igg. this could contribute to the lower immune response and lower inhibitory capacity of the obtained sera. it is also possible that the immune response was directed predominantly against the glycan moieties of the constant region in case of the whole igg, as the glycosylation profile of monoclonal antibodies is affected by the cell culture conditions and can differ from the normal antibody glycosylation observed in vivo  <cit> . based on the observed inhibitory capacity, only the mice immunized with fab v5b <dig> and fab v5b2-klh were sacrificed for the cell fusion. the resulting hybridoma cell lines produced predominantly igg ab <dig> antibodies, in contrast to other ab <dig> antibody studies, where the antibodies were mainly of the igm class  <cit> . the obtained ab <dig> antibodies bound fab v5b <dig> with a high affinity, characteristic of affinity-matured iggs.

the main objective in the present study was to select ab <dig> antibodies that recognize private idiotopes. therefore, the selection process included fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies with the same specificities for the peptide antigen, but with different specificities for the prion protein isoforms. indeed, the majority of the antibodies used in the negative selection process  were directed against the p <dig> peptide derived from the c-terminal amino-acid sequence of the human prion protein, which can adopt different conformations in solution, and therefore, which can elicit antibodies of different specificities when injected into wild-type mice  <cit> . the comparison of the variable region amino-acid sequences of both the light and heavy chains, between antibodies that had been used in the negative selection process and our antigen, fab v5b <dig>  revealed considerable analogy. the vh and vl amino-acid sequences of these antibodies differ only slightly, and most importantly, the differences between these antibodies are predominantly restricted to the cdr regions . nevertheless, all of the ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies selected still distinguished between the fab fragments of these antibodies, which indicated a very precise selectivity of our ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies for private idiotopes, most probably restricted to the cdr regions of v5b <dig>  subsequent in silico structural modelling of the 5d12-v5b <dig> complex also revealed the close interaction of both cdr regions .

based on the selection process described and the affinities of the ab <dig> antibodies for fab v5b <dig> as well as their inhibition potential, two ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies, 5d <dig> and 4f <dig>  were selected for further characterization. since no functional test is available to determine the presence of ab <dig> antibodies that bind to the antigen-combining site of a prpsc-specific antibody, at first an elisa-based inhibition assay was designed to characterize the ab <dig> antibody response. ab <dig> antibodies in chicken and mouse polyclonal immune sera and ab <dig> murine monoclonal antibodies  substantially inhibited the binding of ab <dig> to the p <dig> peptide in a dose-dependent manner. this indicated that in agreement with idiotypic network theory, immunization with fab v5b <dig> induced ab <dig> antibodies, which bear the functional epitope for ab <dig> that competes with the original antigen, the p <dig> peptide, and in turn have to be similar to the p <dig> peptide structure. the reasons for the stronger inhibition of the polyclonal immune sera in comparison to monoclonal antibodies can be accounted for by the higher antibody concentration, a wider variety of ab <dig> antibody specificities, and consequently also a wider variety of target epitopes present in polyclonal preparations.

in addition to the elisa-based inhibition assay, the competitive immunohistochemistry assay was set up to show that ab <dig> antibodies inhibit not only binding of v5b <dig> to the p <dig> peptide but also to the original target molecule, prpsc. indeed, we observed 90% and 50% inhibition of binding of v5b <dig> to prpsc using high concentrations of 5d <dig> and 4f <dig>  respectively, whereas the isotype control did not show any significant inhibition at the same concentrations. the inhibition of binding was concentration dependent, which indicates the specificity of the effects seen. furthermore we saw 88% inhibition with the use of much lower concentrations of polyclonal ch <dig> as competitor, again probably due to a wider variety of ab <dig> antibody specificities with synergistic effects, present in the polyclonal preparation. the results of the competitive immunohistochemical studies, together with the results of the competitive elisa, strongly indicate that the selected ab <dig> antibodies bind into the v5b <dig> binding site, thereby hindering the binding of v5b <dig> to the p <dig> peptide, and most importantly to the original target, the prpsc molecule. in addition, the structural model of the 5d12-v5b <dig> complex, obtained by molecular docking, also strongly supports the close interaction of both antibody-combining regions, since the majority of the interacting residues are located in the cdr regions .

based on previous studies, ab <dig> antibodies can resemble the amino-acid sequences of nominal antigens in their variable regions, especially when the nominal antigen is a peptide  <cit> . the p <dig> peptide motif could be preserved in a single cdr sequence or in a conformational stretch across different cdr loops of a single chain, as well as across different loops of both the heavy and light chains. the latter, i.e. the involvement of different cdr loops of both chains, is also evident from the proposed model of the 5d12-v5b <dig> complex. the comparison of the 5d <dig> binding interface to the p <dig> peptide reveals structural similarities to its c-terminal. this is especially important in the light of our recent unpublished data, which indicate that the c-terminal residues are crucial for the v5b <dig> binding to the p <dig> peptide. it is therefore possible that the 5d <dig> binding surface mimics the crucial part of the p <dig> peptide and the epitope, unique to the prpsc molecule. nevertheless, the computer modelling data must be interpreted cautiously; still, the obtained docking model is in agreement with the observed experimental data. the proposed model also achieved an outstanding ranking score using both the surface complementarity and the global energy criteria.

CONCLUSIONS
with all of the data collected, we have shown that it is possible to induce a strong ab <dig> antibody immune response against a prpsc-specific monoclonal antibody in both the xenogeneic and the syngeneic experimental systems. among the three different antigens tested, the fab fragment was the most successful form for the immunization of mice. in addition, we have demonstrated that it is possible to select ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies specific for private idiotopes using a two-step selection process. in our case, the availability of related antibodies that predominantly differ in cdr regions only, enabled the critical selection step in the negative selection process. ab2β, the internal image antibodies, are directed against the binding site of the eliciting antibody and are structural and/or functional mimics of the original antigen. according to the convincing results of the competition studies and the computer modelling data, 5d <dig> is a highly plausible candidate for being an internal image antibody, mimicking the prpsc-specific epitope. the results of the present study not only provide an example of the successful production of ab <dig> monoclonal antibodies based on a well planned strategy for selection, but should also provide a new experimental approach that is applicable to the field of prion diseases.
