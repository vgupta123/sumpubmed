BACKGROUND
sugarcane is an important crop worldwide, producing 80% of the world’s raw sugar and is increasingly used for bio-fuel
 <cit> . a key goal in meeting growing demand is to improve sugarcane yield and accelerate selection for desirable traits. genomics has been shown to be successful in genome-assisted breeding programs for selecting superior genotypes and more efficient breeding strategies.

species of the saccharum complex  are part of the poaceae family and together with sorghum, zea and other genera comprise the panicoidae superfamily, one of the c <dig> photosynthetic grass lineages 
 <cit> . at the end of nineteenth century, early sugarcane breeders in java and india carried out crosses between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum in order to introduce vigor and resistance genes from wild s. spontaneum, while quickly recovering the high sugar content of s. officinarum cultivars
 <cit> . modern sugarcane cultivars are derived from those early interspecific genotypes, followed by several cycles of intercrossing and selection. they are polyploid aneuploid hybrids with unequal contribution from s. officinarum  and s. spontaneum  parental genomes and a small percentage of recombinant chromosomes
 <cit> . sugarcane hybrids have ploidy levels of  <dig> or more and have a much larger total genome size  than that of maize , sorghum  or rice  reflecting the high polyploidy level of sugarcane cultivars
 <cit> .

the sorghum genome, the closest related fully sequenced and annotated genome to sugarcane, is widely recognized as reference genome for comparative analysis. the origin of modern sugarcane cultivars raises issues not only related to the extent and nature of the divergence of the sugarcane and sorghum genomes, but also about the relationships  among homologous loci. equally importantly, deciphering the sugarcane genome is a major goal for improving genome wide assisted selection breeding opportunities worldwide. however, the hybrid polyploid nature of modern cultivars imposes limitations to breeders in understanding genotype to phenotype allelic variation and dosage. the present study was undertaken within the framework of a larger sequencing initiative to generate a comprehensive dataset, providing information on sugarcane genome structure and function as a basis for future functional genetic studies.

RESULTS
bac sequencing and repeat annotation
three hundred and seventeen sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosome  inserts of a r <dig> cultivar genomic library
 <cit>  were sequenced. a total of  <dig> bacs were selected using probes homologous to  <dig> previously described expressed genes
 <cit> . seventy-eight bacs were selected for using probes based on five superfamilies of transcriptionally active transposable elements . the remaining  <dig> bacs were selected in a previous study using rflp markers from nine sugarcane linkage groups
 <cit>  .

in total,  <dig>  million bases were sequenced with an average of 361 bp per read,  <dig>  reads per bac, and  <dig> x coverage . this represents  <dig> % of the monoploid complement, based on the estimate of a  <dig> gb genome size for the decaploid hybrid cultivar r570
 <cit> . two hundred and five bacs were assembled into one contig each and the remaining  <dig> bacs were assembled into an average of  <dig>  contigs. although not all bacs were single contigs, all have a proposed scaffold and are a single-fasta file. to date, most of the gaps have repetitive sequences at the ends. the minimum, maximum, median, and average sizes of bac assemblies were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. a blastn search indicates that none of the sequences were derived from chloroplast or mitochondrial genomes.

the repetitive content was estimated from bac assemblies using the repbase database
 <cit>  and a curated sugarcane long terminal repeat  retrotransposon database
 <cit> . fifty percent of the bac sequences are repetitive,  <dig> % transposable elements  and  <dig> % satellite repeats . of the tes, ltr retrotransposons are the most abundant , followed by dna transposons , and non-ltr retrotransposons. te content of individual bacs is highly heterogeneous, varying from zero  to  <dig> %. miniature inverted-repeat tes  represent 3% of the sequences. of  <dig>  curated mites, the most abundant types are tourist , followed by stowaway , hat , mule , unclassified  and cacta . sugarcane has a ratio of gypsy-ty <dig> to copia-ty <dig> elements  more closely resembling that of maize , than of sorghum  or rice  genomes, suggesting a closer correlation with genome size rather than with phylogeny.

gene annotation and cds validation
bac assemblies masked for repetitive sequences were analyzed by a combination of de novo gene prediction software programs and searches against databases to identify non-te coding genes. for  <dig> bacs there were no predicted protein-coding genes identified. a total of  <dig>  coding regions were predicted and annotated. an average of  <dig>  cdss  were found per  <dig> kb, representing one protein-coding gene per  <dig>  kb. rna-seq data from the cultivar rb92- <dig> and the sugarcane assembled est sequences  from the sucest  project
 <cit>  were used to validate cdss. all cdss mapped against at least one sas and  <dig>  mapped against at least one pair of rna-seq reads . this may be because there was no detectable expression of these genes under the experimental conditions used, or high sequence divergence between the two cultivars  for these specific loci, and/or false positive gene annotation.

using blast2go, go  terms were assigned to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding sequences . a total of  <dig>  go functional terms were assigned to the  <dig>  sequences. go terms were placed into three broad categories, biological process  <dig>  , molecular function  <dig>   and cellular component  <dig>  . the most abundant terms in the biological process category include cellular process and metabolic process and in the molecular function category, catalytic activity and binding. in the cellular component category, the most common terms were organelle, membrane and cell . blastp searches against the ncbi nr database
 <cit>  confirmed that most of the sugarcane protein sequences are most similar to those of sorghum . the top blast match for  <dig> protein sequences was to sorghum sequences.

cdss were broadly distributed amongst the  <dig> functional categories described by the sucest project
 <cit>  . transcriptionally active genes  were evaluated by a wu-blast search using sass as queries against the bacs. sixteen ½ percent of the sass matched the unmasked bacs, i.e. for  <dig> % of the sass there was no match to the unmasked bacs. in the masked bacs, there were matches for 13% of the sass. these percentages may represent an overestimation due to multiple matches to homologous or paralogous genes. annotated tes were homologous to  <dig> % of sass, suggesting that  <dig> % of the transcriptome is derived from tes. our present estimate is close to that of a previous estimate of  <dig> %
 <cit> .

metabolic pathway genes
mapping of annotated cdss and sass using the kegg mapper tool at mg-rast
 <cit>  provided a global view of known sugarcane metabolic pathways. the comparison between bac cdss and sass mapping identified genes not previously reported in the sugarcane transcriptome. ec numbers were assigned to  <dig> predicted enzyme-coding genes distributed amongst various metabolic pathways, including those involved in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism . most of the predicted enzymes  were identified in the sass collection only,  <dig> were common to the sas and bac sequences and  <dig> identified by bac sequence alone. genes predicted from bac sequence alone included enzyme-coding genes from the carotenoid, amino acid, diterpenoids and other fatty acids biosynthesis pathways .

twenty-nine genes involved in sucrose and starch metabolism  were identified, representing  <dig> non-redundant genes. figure 
 <dig> is a schematic representation of the central carbon metabolism pathway where phosphoglucomutase, responsible for the reversible conversion of α-d-glucose-1p and α-d-glucose-6p, is at the center of the diagram. these two enzymes, together with β-d-fructose-6p, are key components in the balancing of metabolic activity in terms of source , sink  and growth . genes encoding the enzymatic components of cellulose  and sucrose synthesis  were also identified.rna-seq data from 5-day old germinating lateral buds of the rb92- <dig> cultivar was mapped to the  <dig> non-redundant enzyme-coding genes involved in sucrose and starch metabolism. if more than one homologous loci to a single sorghum loci was identified, the minimum and the maximum number of reads mapped to all loci are shown . the high number of mapped rna-seq suggests that it is an active pathway involved in growth of the young bud tissue. the most actively transcribed gene encodes phosphoglucomutase followed by cellulose synthase and glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. sucrose synthesis is mainly driven by the activity of sucrose synthase, however the two-step process catalyzed by sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase is also transcribed.figure  <dig>

three loci were identified for the glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase gene, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of α-d-glucose-1-phosphate into adp-glucose. this is the first and key regulatory step in starch synthesis
 <cit> . based on our rna-seq mapping data, one locus was more highly expressed than other two . the glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase enzyme is composed of two large and two small subunits
 <cit> . in maize, the large subunit is coded by the maize sh <dig> locus, which is well characterized in plants, and in particular in grasses. four loci are responsible for this reaction in sorghum . three of these loci were identified in sugarcane bacs, sb09g <dig> , sb01g <dig>  and sb03g <dig> . the sugarcane orthologous of bacs shcrba_022_d <dig>  shcrba_012_a <dig> and shcrba_009_b <dig> correspond to the sh <dig> locus .

sucrose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase  catalyzes the reaction from sucrose-6p to sucrose. there is a tandem duplication of this gene, not previously published, but evidenced by genomic sequences in the phytozome database
 <cit> , in sorghum , setaria italica  and panicum virgatum . however, the same duplication is not found in maize or any of the other grass genomes available. the bac shcrba_104_g <dig> annotation suggests that s6pp is duplicated in the sugarcane genome. in order to better understand this region, which is important for sucrose synthesis, we examined the composition of the intergenic region between the two copies of s6pp in modern sugarcane cultivars, saccharum species, sorghum and miscanthus sp. by sequencing a pcr amplified  <dig>  bp fragment. one hundred and ninety amplicons were aligned against sorghum sequences and the r <dig> bac . overall nucleotide identity is high,  <dig> % . the sorghum sequence is the most divergent with an average  <dig> %  identity compared with all other sequences. s. spontaneum sequences are more divergent from the other sugarcane sequences . neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses resulted in unresolved evolutionary relationships .

network analyses can be used to predict relationships amongst sequences with low diversity
 <cit> . because of the low sequence diversity of the sugarcane s6pp duplication, a haplotype network was generated to describe the relationships of sugarcane species and cultivars. thirty percent of the sequences fell into five main haplotypes . four of these haplotypes were from s. officinarum, modern sugarcane hybrids and miscanthus sp., the fifth is found specifically in the modern sugarcane hybrids. the most common haplotype consists of  <dig> sequences, from the r <dig> bac , s. officinarum, sugarcane hybrids and miscanthus sp. in networks, haplotype clustering with higher number of sequences is associated with ancestral, shared characters
 <cit> , while dispersed sequences is associated with the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions, i.e., derived characters. although s. spontaneum is a parental species to modern sugarcane hybrids, s. spontaneum sequences are the most dispersed in the network analysis. this suggests that either particular s. spontaneum cultivars were used in breeding crosses or s. spontaneum chromosomes with the substitutions in this genomic region were not transmitted during the hybridization events.figure  <dig>

srnas in sugarcane bacs
a srna library from sugarcane leaf tissue
 <cit>  was mapped against the bacs to evaluate the srna landscape and to identify new microrna  genes . this library was derived from the hybrid sp80- <dig>  the main cultivar used to produce the sucest database
 <cit> . most srnas from grasses are in the 24-nucleotide size range and therefore are most likely small interfering rnas  or repeated-associated small interfering rnas 
 <cit> . sixty-one percent of the srnas in the sp80- <dig> srna library were in the 23–25 nt range, and 48% of them mapped to tes identified in the bacs. the 23–25 nt rnas mapped to the tes are  <dig> × more frequent than did the smaller 20–22 nt rnas. this pattern is expected for rasirnas
 <cit>  and suggests that tes are the origin of the 23–25 nt rasirnas, as well as the target for srna-mediated gene regulation.

we searched the bacs for the  <dig> sugarcane primary mirna  genes previously described
 <cit>  in an attempt to identify mirna genes. one mirna locus was identified. this pri-mirna, a mir <dig> precursor , has high similarity  to mite-derived hairpin sequences  in the hairpin region, and the intron has high similarity to a line/rte non-ltr retrotransposon . the high similarity between the hairpin sequence of ssmir437a and a mite corroborates recent publications positing that some plant mirna families are derived from tes, including mites
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

ribosomal and pericentromeric and/or centromeric bacs
no protein-coding genes were identified in  <dig> bacs and these were further analysed to better understand their sequence composition. three bacs  were predicted to be pericentromeric and/or centromeric and one  was entirely composed of ribosomal tandem repeats. the other bacs were te rich or had no significant matches to grass protein sequences available.

the ribosomal dna  bac consisted of  <dig> 45s ribosomal transcription units with a portion of one unit in the reverse orientation to the other  <dig> . each 45s ribosomal unit was  <dig>  kb long, consisting of the 18s  ribosomal gene, the 208 bp internal transcribed spacer  <dig> , the  <dig> s  ribosomal gene, the 216 bp internal transcribed spacer  <dig> , the 26s  ribosomal gene, and the 527 bp intergenic spacer . the 45s ribosomal transcription units were  <dig> % identical at the nucleotide level.

the three bacs classified as pericentromeric and/or centromeric contain the previously described sugarcane 137 bp centromeric repeat scen
 <cit> , and plant specific gypsy-ty <dig> centromeric specific-like retrotransposons 
 <cit> . annotation of one of the centromeric bacs is shown in more detail in additional file
12: figure s7b. schrba_239_n <dig> is 23% scen repeats and contains multiple copies of crm and tat elements. crm_ <dig> was the only complete crm element identified. three tat elements were identified , all full-length. four hundred and thirty nine copies of the scen repeat were identified with a pairwise nucleotide identity of  <dig> %.

r <dig> cultivar metaphase spreads were examined for localization of the pericentromeric/centromeric schrba_239_n <dig> and ribosomal bac by fish . the pericentromeric/centromeric bac schrba_239_n <dig> hybridized to a region consistent with it being a component of the centromeric or pericentric region of all chromosomes, however, signal strength varied among chromosomes. additional fainter signals observed on chromosome arms were probably from non-centromeric specific ltr retrotransposons in the bac
 <cit> . for the ribosomal bac, there were seven terminal, three interstitial and two undetermined signals.

comparative genomics with sorghum
a blast based pipeline against the sorghum genome and protein databases was used to determine the distribution of the bacs relative to the sorghum genome in order to examine synteny between genomes and to gain insights into the evolution of sugarcane genomic structure
 <cit> . a sorghum ortholog was assigned to  <dig>  sugarcane predicted genes, with a redundancy of  <dig> %. after excluding redundant genes ,  <dig> genes were analysed. for  <dig> genes there was a single blast match against sorghum-annotated proteins
 <cit>  and orthologous relationships for the remaining  <dig> genes were inferred by high-throughput maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis
 <cit> . using the chromosomal locations of the  <dig> sorghum-sugarcane orthologous, we were able to localize  <dig> sugarcane bacs onto sorghum chromosomal arms . despite the small number of bacs and the limited number of probes, our strategy tagged all sorghum chromosome arms. the bacs mapped chiefly to the euchromatic regions, as defined by published sorghum genome annotation
 <cit> . fifty-four bacs were not used in this mapping analysis. fourteen of these contained no predicted protein-coding genes, among them were the pericentromeric/centromeric and ribosomal bacs described above, and  <dig> bacs with sorghum-sugarcane orthologous assigned to more than one sorghum chromosome.figure  <dig>

 <cit> . horizontal black lines show the location of bacs that overlap with at least one gene. numbers above the black bars indicate the number of bacs that overlap at that point.



we defined a set of stringent criteria to investigate genome size variation with this collection of sugarcane and sorghum orthologous genes. all sugarcane genes whose predicted protein coding-sequence length was not within 90% to 110% of the length of the sorghum ortholog were discarded. only syntenic blocks with perfect colinearity of at least two genes were considered. three hundred forty nine unique genes and  <dig> intergenic regions were identified within  <dig> syntenic blocks in  <dig> bacs . although the average size of the cdss were not significantly different, the introns and intergenic regions were statistically significantly longer in sugarcane than in sorghum , suggesting that sugarcane underwent or is undergoing genome expansion relative to sorghum.table  <dig>

**p <  <dig> . a: the nucleotide length between genes in a colinear region. se: standard error, df: degree of freedom.



the syntenic blocks were further analysed to determine the nature of the sugarcane genome expansion. these were  <dig>  mb long in total in sugarcane and  <dig>  mb in sorghum. sugarcane and sorghum have equivalent numbers of bases encoding gene exons,  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively. therefore, introns, promoters and intergenic regions may account for the sugarcane syntenic region being  <dig>  mb larger. repeat content in sugarcane was  <dig>  mb  and low complexity regions). repeat content in sorghum was  <dig>  mb . the difference between the two species in repeat content indicates that the  <dig>  mb expansion of the sugarcane genome is due mainly to te amplification. among the te sequences, copia-ty <dig> elements are the most common , followed by gypsy-ty <dig>  and dna transposons, including cacta , hat  and mutator elements . the large fraction of unaccounted nucleotides in both sorghum  and sugarcane  may represent unidentified novel genes, uncharacterized tes, or as-yet-unknown genomic elements.

homologous diversity and expression of rpa1alocus
the largest group of sugarcane bacs that mapped to a single region within a sorghum chromosome was analyzed to evaluate homologous and genome size diversification. these were twelve bacs selected using a probe for the single copy rpa1a  gene. rpa1a is known to play an essential role in dna repair in rice
 <cit> . in addition to the rpa1a gene, the bacs contained seven additional genes and a number of incomplete and putatively full-length ltr retrotransposons and dna transposons . structural analyses indicate that these bacs represent a number of homologous regions. the colinearity was interrupted mainly by differential distribution and size of te insertions. a comparison with the orthologous region of the sorghum genome  confirms that the sugarcane genome has longer intergenic regions than sorghum, as described above.figure  <dig>

the cdss of the six genes shared by the  <dig> bacs and sorghum were aligned and concatenated to construct a phylogenetic tree . most of the sugarcane sequences fell into three well-supported groups  that were in agreement with the structural analysis. bacs shcrba_232_h <dig> and shcrba_227_o <dig> did not group with bacs that they were structurally closely related to, but fell in a separated, less related group . bacs shcrba_035_b <dig> and shcrba_196_o <dig> fell outside all these groups. interestingly, the topology of the phylogeny based on the concatenated cdss generally reflects differences of te content in the region examined. the main structural variation between the bacs in groups i and ii is the presence of a dna transposon between the fifth and sixth genes in group i, instead of the harbinger cluster found in group ii. no structural variation between groups ii and iii was detected, apart from a variant region downstream from the sixth gene, which contained several copies of different ltr retrotransposons.

the bacs selected using the rpa1a gene were also mapped against the sucest database  and the rna-seq and srna libraries. figure 
5b shows mapping for one bac of each of the three phylogenetic groups  and the other two bacs . while most of the mrna transcripts mapped against the cdss, some srnas also mapped against te sequences or non-coding regions, as expected. two expression patterns were of particular note. first, there was a common region in all bacs, downstream from a ltr retrotransposon, with peaks of mrna sequences . transcription of this region may be directed by promoter sequences in the 3′ ltr of the ltr retrotransposon. alternatively, there may be an unidentified gene in this region. second, differential homologs expression was identified . there are different srna patterns between bacs in the region between the rpa1a gene  and gene  <dig>  no srna reads were mapped to bacs shcrba_035_b <dig> or shcrba_196_o <dig>  in which the intergenic region between the rpa1a gene and gene  <dig> is the shortest . on the other hand, in bacs shcrba_101_b <dig>  shcrba_201_d <dig> and shcrba_232_h <dig>  where the intergenic regions are longer , there is also a higher number of mapped srnas. the main difference in the intergenic region in the bac with the lowest  and the highest  srnas number of reads is the presence of dna transposon fragments and a harbinger te in bac shcrba_101_b <dig> , which support current models that these elements contribute to gene modulation
 <cit> .

discussion
the present study releases the largest and most diverse collection of sugarcane genomic regions to date. based on comparative analysis, these regions are distributed throughout all sorghum chromosomes and are chiefly euchromatic. an understanding of these genomic regions will increase our knowledge of the structure of the sugarcane genome. the selected bac collection includes genes known to be expressed and reveals a diverse set of sugarcane sequences associated with major biological processes. insight into transcriptional patterns and epigenetic regulation were provided by the complementary rna sequencing approaches.

previous studies have shown that there is a high level of colinearity, gene structure, and sequence conservation between sorghum and sugarcane
. however, these reports conflict in terms of whether the sugarcane genome is expanding, or has expanded, relative to the sorghum genome or vice versa. our data, based on a much larger sampling of linear genomic sequence, and assembled regions , confirms the colinearity and conservation between the sorghum and sugarcane genomes. it also suggests that overall the sugarcane genome has undergone or is undergoing expansion within euchromatic regions compared with sorghum. this expansion is highly variable depending on the syntenic block examined , possibly explaining why the previous reports are conflicting. nearly one-fourth of the sugarcane genome expansion compared with the sorghum can be attributed to differences in te content, largely ltr retrotransposons. the presence of these dynamic elements within euchromatic regions may act as key factors in chromosome rearrangements, gene gain and loss, as well as epigenetic marks. similar mechanisms have been shown to be associated with tes in other grass genomes such as maize
.

bacs from repetitive genomic regions were examined. among these was a bac composed entirely of 45s ribosomal units. a consistent variation in signal intensity from chromosome to chromosome was observed using rdna and pericentromeric and/or centromeric bacs as probes for fish . centromeres within a species are generally composed of the same types of repeats, while the abundance and arrangement of repeats can vary both between and within species
 <cit> . given the hybrid nature of sugarcane modern cultivars, variation in the pericentromeric/centromeric bac signal may therefore be a reflection of the differences in pericentromeric/centromeric composition within or between the parental species. based on previous findings using the same cultivar, the less intense interstitial rdna signals are on s. spontaneum chromosomes, while the more intense terminal signals are on s. officinarum chromosomes
 <cit> . while the rdna genes are highly conserved, its sequence divergence can be used to resolve species relationships within a genus. following polyploidization events, its units can suffer several different fates, depending on the species and time since polyploidization, for example, loss of one parental type, or homogenization
 <cit> . it would appear that the position of the rdna units from both parental species have been retained in modern sugarcane cultivars.

we estimate that almost one-half of the sugarcane bac sequences are tes. this estimate is close to that based on bac-end sequences  from two sugarcane cultivars, r <dig> 
 <cit>  and sp80- <dig> 
 <cit> . in general, as genome size increases the proportion of the genome composed of repeats increases
 <cit> . a significant proportion of grass genomes are composed of repetitive sequences, 40%, 62% and 82% for rice , sorghum , and maize , respectively
 <cit> . the basic genome size  for s. officinarum, the main component of modern sugarcane cultivars genome, is 930 mb
 <cit> , larger than sorghum . s. spontaneum, also one of the ancestors of modern sugarcane cultivars, is 750 mb
 <cit> , similar to sorghum. the total monoploid genome size of the r <dig> modern cultivar, however, is  <dig> gb. the percent of the sugarcane genome composed of repeats based on the bac sequences is most likely an underestimate because the bacs were mainly from euchromatic gene-rich regions. nevertheless, the low percent of repeats compared to genomes of a comparable size may also be a reflection of the size of modern sugarcane cultivar genome as a result of polyploidization events rather than as the result of massive te expansion.

we examined all homologous regions identified containing the rpa1a gene to better understand the consequences of polyploidization in terms of genome structure and regulation. most of the structural variation among the bacs was due to variability in te insertion patterns, although the topology of the phylogenetic tree inferred using the coding gene sequences reflects structural variation between homologous regions. the topology indicates that there is at least three well-defined haplogroups in this region. we speculate that these haplotypes are derived from the parental species. the  <dig> bacs from the groups a, b, and c  were inherited from s. officinarum and the two remaining from s. spontaneum. we were not able to evaluate if there is any selective constraint driving the diversification of the putative homologous sequences from s. officinarum as haplogroups. further sequencing of this region in s. officinarum and s. spontaneum may identify any selective constraint.

the high conservation of gene content and colinearity between sugarcane haplotypes has been previously shown, here we confirm this finding analyzing more homologs of a single region
 <cit> . these results contrast with the high dna sequence elimination and recombination observed between homologous chromosomes in allopolyploid wheat and other monocot and eudicot plants . in all these cases, it is not clear if the changes occurred immediately after polyploidization. we consider that the high conservation is not due to the gene richness of the regions, since the gene frequency in the rpa1a bacs is much lower than those regions studied in previous colinearity studies in sugarcane
. there are several possible reasons for the low recombination rate in this region. the hybridization events resulting in the modern sugarcane cultivar are very recent, within the last two centuries, and it has been estimated that there have been few meiotic divisions since
 <cit> . the parental species themselves have recently diverged, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago. finally, the evolution of the haplogroups in this polyploid genome may have been shaped by the phenomenon of pairing behavior, which favors the transmission of non-mutated chromosomes to the progeny
 <cit> .

we mapped srna and mrna libraries against the rpa1a region. the results show that the homologous bacs have differential mapping patterns for both kinds of rnas. most of the variation was observed in promoters, tes and intergenic sequences. the promoter regions within the ltrs at each end of an ltr retrotransposon can act as novel promoters or enhancers, driving changes in host-gene expression patterns
 <cit> . there are peaks of rna  mapping in a region downstream to an ltr retrotransposon, where no non-te-coding genes have been identified. promoters within the 3′ ltr region may be driving expression of this region in an allelic dependent manner. the region between two host genes is variable both in length and for the presence/absence of te fragments. peaks of srna mapped between the two non-te coding genes correlates with the intergenic length and the presence of tes. several studies have shown that homologous diversity needs to be evaluated not only in terms of gene coding dna, but also in terms of regulatory regions, since regulatory regions have important roles in genetic control and are under independent evolutionary pressures
 <cit> . this can be particularly important in polyploids, due to the high number of homologous loci. in the rpa1a bacs there are indications of mrna and srna variation, as evidenced by the srna and transcriptome mapping, that could influence gene expression and function. interestingly, the two most highly expressed rpa1a homologs correspond to a bac that did not cluster within the three main haplotypes and another from cluster iii.

crop genomics is being used to increase the effectiveness of breeding, since traits of interest can be selected more precisely, directly and cost-effectively
 <cit> . for over 10 years directed genetic modification of sugarcane has been a reality in laboratories with field trials also being conducted
 <cit> . genomics could also aid in traditional marker-based breeding, providing putative marker sequences derived from genes, tes, intergenic or low complexity regions
. here we have sequenced and annotated  <dig>  sugarcane protein-coding genes and several non-coding genes, including ribosomal and mirna genes. the protein-coding genes code for enzymes in several metabolic pathways. for some of the genes that are clearly important in sugarcane breeding, for example, genes from the sucrose and starch metabolism, the complete cdss are available in the transcriptome database, but no information about introns and intergenic regions have been previously published. other genes have not been previously sequenced in sugarcane, among them genes involved in the metabolic pathways not traditionally considered in sugarcane breeding, such as the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. the sequencing of complete genes, including coding regions, utrs, introns and promoters in genomic sequencing projects, instead of sequencing only transcribed sequences, as in transcriptome sequencing projects, provides a broader database for the design of transgene constructs. this work has shown that it is fundamental to combine genome and transcriptome sequencing approaches  to validate genome annotation and provide a broad understanding of functional genomics.

the potential of the sequenced bac collection was demonstrated by sequencing  <dig> genes related to the central enzymatic steps of carbon partitioning in source-sink-growth in plants. three main conclusions were drawn. first, the sequenced regions enabled the identification of differential expression levels in specific enzymatic steps in actively growing bud tissue. second, we were able to differentiate the expression of paralogous loci. finally, a previously unreported gene duplication was described for the s6pp gene in sugarcane and sorghum. examination of a region covering the intergenic region and part of the two genes from a commercial hybrid breeding panel, s. officinarum, s. spontaneum, miscanthus sp and the sorghum genome shows that s. spontaneum did not contribute to the haplotype identified in hybrid cultivars. interestingly, the miscanthus sp. sequences fell into four major haplotype groups. another haplotype group consisted exclusively of commercial hybrids. sequence variability among paralogous or homologous allelic loci has to be considered, since the most effective gene copy should be selected in order to avoid non-additive effects
 <cit> . thus, it is essential to sequence further candidate homologous regions that have the potential to be valuable in transgenic breeding, in order to increase our knowledge of sugarcane gene variability.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequence released in the present work contributes towards a fundamental understanding of the structure of the sugarcane genome. the present data will also contribute to improving our understanding of the genetic basis of sucrose content and physiology, providing molecular tools for breeding purposes and gene discovery related to traits such as plant defense, metabolism, flowering, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.
