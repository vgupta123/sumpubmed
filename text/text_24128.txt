BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major cause of nosocomial infections, especially in intensive care units
 <cit> . both its ability to acquire resistant determinants and to adapt to harsh environments has made a. baumannii a successful pathogen
 <cit> . a. baumannii has high rates of resistance to many available antibiotics in clinical practice. for example, imipenem-resistant a. baumannii constituted > 50% of a worldwide collection of clinical samples between  <dig> and 2009
 <cit> . a taiwanese surveillance report of antimicrobial resistance in  <dig> found that 73% of a. baumannii isolates collected from  <dig> medical centers and regional hospitals were ceftazidime-resistant
 <cit> . therefore, there are only a few effective anti-acinetobacter drugs currently available, including polymyxins and tigecycline
 <cit> . tigecycline is the first drug from the glycylcycline class, a new class of antibiotics derived from tetracycline
 <cit> . tigecycline acts as a protein synthesis inhibitor by binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit, and thus blocking entry of the trna into the a site of the ribosome during translation. although tigecycline has an expanded spectrum of antibacterial activity, previous studies have shown that tigecycline resistance has emerged in a. baumannii. resistance in these strains is associated with multidrug efflux systems, especially the overexpression of the adeabc genes, which encode an efflux pump
 <cit> . the adeabc pump belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division  family, which has a three-component structure
 <cit> .

bacterial two-component systems  play an important role in the regulation of adaptation to and signal transduction of environmental stimuli, including stress conditions
 <cit> . tcss are typically composed of a membrane-localized sensor with histidine kinase activity and a cytoplasmic response regulator . generally, upon sensing environmental changes, signaling begins via autophosphorylation of the sensor protein at a conserved histidine residue. the phosphate is then transferred to an aspartic acid residue in the so-called receiver domain of the corresponding rr. phosphorylation may induce conformational changes in rrs, which alters their dna- binding properties, thus modulating downstream gene expression
 <cit> . importantly, the roles of tcss in the regulation of antimicrobial resistance have recently been documented in several species of bacteria
 <cit> . additionally, the ades-ader tcs controls genes encoding the adeabc pump in a. baumannii <cit> . ades is a sensor kinase, whereas ader is an rr. point mutations in ades and ader, or a truncation of ades due to an isaba <dig> insertion, may be related to the overexpression of adeabc, which leads to multidrug resistance
 <cit> . however, the existence of adeabc-overexpressing mutants without any mutations in aders <cit>  and the low expression of adeabc in a clinical strain of a. baumannii with the isabai insertion in the aders operon
 <cit>  suggest that the regulation of adeabc gene expression is complicated, and other regulatory mechanisms may be involved.

baesr is a tcs and is one of the five extracytoplasmic response pathways in escherichia coli. baesr detects environmental signals and responds by altering the bacterial envelope
 <cit> . the main function of the bae response is to upregulate efflux pump expression in response to specific envelope-damaging agents
 <cit> . indole, flavonoids, and sodium tungstate have been shown to be novel inducers of the baesr response
 <cit> . in salmonella typhimurium, one of the physiological roles of baer is to respond to stresses that specifically damage mdta, leading to an induction of mdta transport and the removal of the toxic agent  from the cell
 <cit> . in tolc mutants or efflux mutants of e. coli, the overexpression of spy, which encodes a periplasmic chaperone, depends on the baers and cpxarp stress response systems
 <cit> . a genome-wide analysis of e. coli gene expression showed that baer overproduction activates genes involved in multidrug transport, flagellum biosynthesis, chemotaxis, and maltose transport
 <cit> . furthermore, baesr is also able to activate the transcription of the yegmnob  transporter gene cluster in e. coli and increases its resistance to novobiocin and deoxycholate
 <cit> . because there is a potential similarity in the biological functions of mdtabcd in e. coli and adeabc in a. baumannii, we here explore the role of baesr in the regulation of the transporter gene adeab in a. baumannii and report the positive regulation of these factors, which leads to increased tigecycline resistance.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the adeab efflux pump and the baer/baes tcs
a search of the genbank database  revealed that, similar to other strains of a. baumannii, the atcc  <dig> strain contains sequences encoding the adeabc-type rnd efflux pump. there are two adea genes  and one adeb gene  in the genome; however, no adec gene was found. adeb is a transmembrane component with two conserved domains: the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux- <dig>  family signature and a domain conserved within the protein export membrane protein secd_secf. both adea proteins are inner membrane fusion proteins with biotin-lipoyl-like conserved domains. we designated a1s_ <dig> as adea <dig> and a1s_ <dig> as adea <dig> for differentiation.

the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> gene a1s_ <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids. sequence alignments of a. baumannii a1s_ <dig> with baer homologs in other bacteria showed that a1s_ <dig> shared  <dig> % similarity with baer of e. coli str. k- <dig> substr. mg <dig> and  <dig> % similarity with baer of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium str. lt <dig> . in addition, protein analysis using prosite  predicted that a. baumannii a1s_ <dig> contained a response regulatory domain at amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and a phosphorylation site at amino acid residue  <dig> . therefore, the role of a1s_ <dig> may be similar to that of baer in other bacterial species; thus, we have designated a1s_ <dig> as baer in a. baumannii.

a. baumannii atcc  <dig> gene a1s_ <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. sequence alignments showed that a1s_ <dig> shared  <dig> % similarity with baes of e. coli str. k- <dig> substr. mg <dig> and  <dig> % similarity with baes of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium str. lt <dig> . protein analysis using prosite predicted that a. baumannii a1s_ <dig> contains a hamp  and a histidine kinase domain at amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. in addition, the histidine at residue  <dig> is predicted to be a phosphorylation site. therefore, the role of a1s_ <dig> may be similar to that of baes in other bacterial species; thus, a1s_ <dig> is designated as baes in a. baumannii.

co-transcription of baer and baes as an operon
although the baesr tcs has been characterized in e. coli <cit> , the biological functions of baesr in a. baumannii have not been revealed. genome analysis of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> shows that the coding sequences of baer  and baes  are arranged sequentially, suggesting that the two genes may be co-transcribed as an operon. to test this hypothesis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  was performed using the primers baes-co f and baes-co r . as shown in figure 
2a, a 793-bp dna fragment covering the junction between both baer and baes was amplified by rt-pcr. we concluded that baer and baes are co-transcribed as a single operon in a. baumannii atcc  <dig>

transcription of baer and baes under normal and stressed conditions
tcss are commonly involved in stress responses in bacteria. because no previous studies have explored the function of a1s_ <dig> and a1s_ <dig>  we began by testing the response of both genes to high osmotic conditions to determine if they have functions that are similar to those of their baesr counterparts in other bacteria. to determine whether a. baumannii baesr participates in the stress response, the relative levels of baer and baes transcription were detected in cells grown in luria-bertani  agar  with or without 20% sucrose. rt-pcr analysis showed that the expression levels of baer and baes were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher in cells exposed to osmotic stress compared with cells grown without sucrose . this result suggested that the baesr tcs in a. baumannii was involved in cellular adaptation to stress conditions such as high osmolarity.

construction of baer deletion mutants and baer-reconstituted strains
to further study the role of the baesr tcs in a. baumannii, in-frame deletion mutants of baer were generated using the method of sugawara et al.
 <cit> . the successful construction of baer deletion mutants was verified by pcr , rt-pcr , and southern blot assays . to generate the baer-reconstituted strain, pwh1266-kan
r
-baer was introduced into the baer deletion mutant  by electroporation. the baer-reconstituted strain was designated ab <dig>  in addition, pwh1266-kan
r
-baer was also introduced into the wild-type strain to generate the strain ab <dig>  successful construction of the ab <dig> and ab <dig> strains was verified by rt-pcr. the expression of baer was comparable in the wild-type and the baer-reconstituted ab <dig> strains, whereas baer was overexpressed in ab <dig> relative to the wild-type strain .

minimal inhibitory concentration  determination
to correlate baer with tigecycline susceptibility, the mic of tigecycline was determined. for a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  the mic of tigecycline was  <dig>  μg/ml. however, the mic of tigecycline for the baer deletion mutant was  <dig>  μg/ml; baer reconstitution restored the mic to the wild-type level . moreover, the overexpression of baer in ab <dig> raised the mic of tigecycline to 1 μg/ml. the introduction of pwh <dig> alone did not affect the mic of tigecycline, whereas the mics obtained with the induced tigecycline-resistant strain abtc and the clinical tigecycline-resistant strain abhl <dig> were  <dig> and 16 μg/ml, respectively. these results indicate that baer is closely related to the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii.

expression of the adeab and baesr genes in strains with different levels of tigecycline resistance
to further decipher the role of the baesr tcs and adeab in tigecycline resistance, we analyzed gene expression in the wild-type a. baumannii strain atcc  <dig> as well as the abtc and abhl <dig> strains. the quantitative real-time pcr  results showed that the expression levels of adeb were 216- and 53-fold higher in abtc and abhl <dig>  respectively, than in the wild-type strain. abtc and abhl <dig> also showed increased transcription of adea <dig> and adea <dig>  although it was less marked than that of adeb . the expression levels of baes and baer in abtc increased  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type strain, whereas those in abhl <dig> only increased  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively . overall, the combination of the qrt-pcr results with the mic assay above suggest that both baesr and adeab are involved in the tigecycline resistance of a. baumannii.

influence of the baesr tcs on adeab efflux pump expression
to understand whether baer influenced the tigecycline mic by affecting the adeab efflux pump gene, the expression of adea <dig>  adea <dig>  and adeb in atcc  <dig>  ab <dig>  ab <dig>  and ab <dig> was analyzed by qrt-pcr. the expression levels of adeb, adea <dig>  and adea <dig> in ab <dig> were approximately  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and 3-fold higher, respectively, than those in atcc  <dig>  while the deletion of baer from the wild-type strain decreased the expression levels of these three pump genes by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively . the decreased expression of the pump genes can be partially restored by baer reconstitution . to determine the impact of baer deletion on ader expression, rt-pcr was also performed. no differences in ader expression were observed between ab <dig> and the wild-type strain . overall, these findings suggest that baer upregulates the expression of adeab genes.

expression analysis of adeab in induced tigecycline-resistant a. baumannii and its baer mutant
to further confirm the role of baer in the tigecycline resistance of a. baumannii via the adeab efflux pump, a baer deletion mutant of abtc  was constructed and adeab expression was analyzed by qrt-pcr. the expression levels of adeb, adea <dig>  and adea <dig> in abtcm were  <dig> ,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % lower, respectively, than those in abtc . these data confirmed the contribution of baer to the regulation of adeab, which is essential to tigecycline resistance in a. baumannii.

time-kill assay
to further compare the effects of baer on tigecycline susceptibility, time-kill assays were performed using atcc  <dig>  ab <dig>  ab <dig>  and ab <dig>  there were no differences in the surviving colony forming units  among these four strains when tigecycline was not added to the lb agar. in the presence of  <dig>  μg/ml tigecycline, all tested strains had similar surviving cfu curves; the lowest value was observed at 4 h, which was followed by regrowth . additionally, ab <dig> showed a greater reduction in cfus than the wild-type strain  throughout the assay period, which could be restored by baer reconstitution. increasing the tigecycline concentration to  <dig>  μg/ml produced an even more marked  <dig> -log <dig> reduction in the cfus of ab <dig> at 8 h, which was followed by regrowth. in contrast, a smaller reduction  was observed for the wild-type strain . however, baer reconstitution did not fully restore the ability of ab <dig> to resist  <dig>  μg/ml tigecycline. ab <dig> showed a slightly smaller reduction in cfus than the wild-type strain in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml tigecycline. therefore, the time-kill assay indicates that the baesr tcs plays a role in the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii.

discussion
previous studies that investigated the regulation of adeabc efflux pumps in a. baumannii primarily focused on the aders tcs, which is located upstream of the adeabc operon and is transcribed in the opposite direction
 <cit> . several point mutations in ader or ades have been proposed as the major cause of adeabc efflux pump overexpression, including a threonine-to-methionine substitution at position 153
 <cit> , a glycine-to-aspartate mutation at position 30
 <cit> , an alanine-to-valine substitution at position  <dig> of ades
 <cit> , or a proline-to-leucine substitution at position  <dig> of ader
 <cit> . however, the effect of ader or ades mutations on the expression of adeabc is not always consistent. different tigecycline mics were observed in two transformed strains with the same mutations in the dna-binding domain of the ader protein
 <cit> . adeabc-overexpressing mutants that did not carry any mutations in aders compared with their isogenic parents were also reported
 <cit> . another mechanism leading to the overexpression of adeabc involves the transposition of an isaba <dig> copy into ades <cit> , which stimulates ader to interact with and activate the adeabc promoter
 <cit> . in contrast to the results of the above-mentioned studies of aders, four imipenem-resistant a. baumannii strains carrying adeb but lacking aders were identified by hou et al.
 <cit> , suggesting that another regulatory mechanism may be involved. henry et al. reported that baesr was associated with the increased expression of the multidrug resistance-associated efflux pump genes macab-tolc and adeijk in their transcriptional analysis of lipopolysaccharide-deficient a. baumannii 19606r
 <cit> . therefore, the role of baesr in the expression of the adeabc efflux pump deserves investigation. our data demonstrate that baesr influences the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii atcc  <dig> through its positive regulation of the transcription of transporter genes adea and adeb. this result supported the possibility that other tcss aside from aders may be involved in the regulation of the adeabc efflux pump in a. baumannii.

most a. baumannii strains have an rnd efflux pump, adeabc, which has a three-component structure with adeb forming the transmembrane component, adea forming the inner membrane fusion protein, and adec forming the outer membrane protein
 <cit> . however, according to the ncbi genbank database, a. baumannii atcc  <dig> lacks an adec gene but has two adea genes and one adeb gene. a. baumannii aye, a. baumannii acicu, a. baumannii atcc  <dig>  and a. baumannii tyth- <dig> all possess an adec-like outer membrane protein. marchand et al. constructed a clinical a. baumannii strain with an inactivated adec. this derivative mutant displayed resistance to the various substrates of the adeabc pump that was similar to that of the wild-type strain, indicating that adec is not essential for resistance
 <cit> . because adec was not found in 41% of the clinical isolates carrying aders-adeab in one study
 <cit> , it is reasonable to deduce that adeab could recruit another outer membrane protein to form a functional tripartite complex
 <cit> .

the first description of tigecycline non-susceptibility was reported by peleg et al.
 <cit> . these authors found that the efflux pump inhibitor phenyl-arginine-β-naphthylamide could cause a four-fold reduction in the mic of tigecycline in two tigecycline-non-susceptible isolates. the qrt-pcr results showed 40-fold and 54-fold increases in adeb expression in these two isolates compared to that observed in a tigecycline-susceptible isolate. their finding is consistent with our comparison of tigecycline mics and expression levels of adeab among the wild-type, abhl <dig>  and abtc strains. despite the important role of adeabc in antibiotic resistance, this efflux pump operon is cryptic in natural isolates of a. baumannii <cit> . antibiotic exposure, including exposure to tigecycline, could induce pump overexpression, resulting in drug resistance
 <cit> ; this was observed in our abtc strain. furthermore, there was a statistically significant linear relationship between log-transformed adea expression values and log-transformed mics of tigecycline in clinical isolates of the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex, indicating that the overexpression of the adeabc efflux pump is a prevalent mechanism for this resistance phenotype
 <cit> .

the modest increase in adeab pump gene expression in ab <dig> relative to the wild-type strain may have been due to the overexpression of baesr. however, because abtcm had only moderately reduced adeb, adea <dig>  and adea <dig> expression levels relative to abtc, we proposed that control mechanisms aside from baesr, such as sequence changes in ader or ades, were responsible for the overexpression of these pump genes. the regulators that are involved in efflux gene expression are either local or global regulators
 <cit> . one of the most well-studied examples is the acrab-tolc system of e. coli <cit> . this system is under the control of the local repressor gene acrr, which negatively regulates the transcription of acrab. on the other hand, global stress conditions are assumed to result in the generation of global transcription regulators. these regulators are unlikely to be mara, soxs, or rob, but could be their homologs. such regulators increase the transcription of not only acrab but also acrr, which functions as a secondary modulator to repress acrab. fernando et al. demonstrated that the transcription patterns of both adeb and adej are cell density-dependent and similar, indicating a role for global regulatory mechanisms in the expression of these genes in a. baumannii <cit> . two-component regulatory systems mediate the adaptive responses of bacterial cells to a broad range of environmental stimuli
 <cit> . in this study, qrt-pcr analysis of baesr expression under high sucrose conditions suggested that this tcs was involved in the regulation related to this stress condition. therefore, we propose that baesr, which functions as an envelope stress response system to external stimuli, also influences the transcription of adeab in a. baumannii by functioning as a regulator of global transcription. meanwhile, the well-described ader is an example of a local regulator that activates adeabc expression
 <cit> . however, the relationship between baesr and aders must be further clarified. because the expression of aders was only marginally increased in the baesr deletion mutants in this study, we assume that the crosstalk between these tcss might be absent or only very weak. the question of whether other tcss are involved in the regulation of the adeabc efflux pump and how they interact in a. baumannii merits further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed for the first time that the baesr tcs influences the tigecycline susceptibility of a. baumannii by positively regulating the rnd efflux pump genes adea and adeb. however, whether baesr can also contribute to tigecycline resistance through other transporter genes, such as macab-tolc and adeijk, is not yet clear, and related studies are underway. overall, this finding highlights the complexity of adeabc transporter regulation and could be a starting point for understanding the role of tcss in the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria.
