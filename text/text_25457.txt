BACKGROUND
data clustering is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields  <cit> , including machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, and image analysis. theoretically, clustering analysis identifies and classifies objects  based on the similarity of the characteristics they possess. it seeks to minimize within-group variation and maximize between-group variation and results in a number of heterogeneous groups with homogeneous contents. the general categories of clustering methods include tree clustering , block clustering, k-means clustering, and model-based clustering  <cit> . the evaluation of clustering analysis is a critical challenge in both theory and application.

the performance of clustering analysis can be assessed statistically in order to determine the appropriate clustering methods and cluster number  <cit> . pseudo f statistic  <cit>  is widely used for partitioning clustering algorithms, such as k-means, and has been included in the procedure fastclust of sas software  <cit> . bic  is a well-established statistic based on standard statistical theory and fits model-based clustering procedures  <cit> , which has been widely applied in bioinformatics  <cit> . silhouette score  <cit>  provides a measure of how well a data point was classified when it was assigned to a cluster according to both the tightness of the clusters and the separation between them. it has been used together with pam  clustering algorithm  <cit> . recently, the so-called gap statistic was proposed  <cit> , which can use the output of any clustering algorithms for the optimization of cluster number. furthermore, clustering algorithms are commonly assessed from other angles, such as robustness, stability, consistency, and functional congruence of the members of the same cluster  <cit> .

on the other hand, while clustering analysis is mainly conducted when we are still in the exploratory phase of our research and do not have any prior hypotheses, the statistical significance testing between the clusters can be meaningful. the testing can help us to assess whether the classification results from running a clustering algorithm need to be improved, even after the cluster number has been determined by a well-established criterion. this is important in the clustering of genes on the basis of the temporal expression profiles. in order to extract specific knowledge about gene function from the expression profiles  <cit> , researchers usually hope to have the number of clusters as large as possible but the contrasts between the clusters, each of which corresponds to a co-regulation pattern, should be statistically significant in general.

the significance testing between the clusters can be done by using hotelling's t <dig>  the multivariate counterpart of student's-t  <cit> . but when the number of measurement points is large and the size of samples is relatively small, the results from hotelling's test are usually unstable  <cit> . using the invariance of elliptical distribution theory, a type of exact t and f tests was proposed  <cit> , which can be applied to high-dimension data with a small size of samples. the tests are based on the sum aggregates of original variables similar to o'brien's method  <cit>  but superior to the latter in maintaining the prescribed level of significance. two direct implementations of the method are a one-fold principal component  test corresponding to the exact t test and a multi-fold principal component test corresponding to the exact f test. the comparison of pc test and t <dig> clearly demonstrated the fact that the stabilizing effect of principal components and pc test made better use of the factor structure of the data of multiple end-points.

microarray technology allows thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously on a single slide. unsupervised learning on the basis of clustering analysis of microarray temporal gene expression data has been widely studied in order to discover classes of expression patterns and identify groups of genes that are regulated in a similar manner  <cit> . however in literature the evaluation of clustering analysis was limited to the global assessment of clustering methods. in this paper, we proposed to use principal component tests based on the exact f test for multiple endpoint measures  <cit>  to assess the significance of the contrasts between the gene clusters from different clustering algorithms and implemented it on a public data set. the testing can be conducted after the global evaluation for improving clustering analysis.

RESULTS
clustering and patterns
the first clustering  to be evaluated was published by iyer et al  <cit> . it was obtained by using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm as mentioned above and contained ten clusters with sizes ranking from  <dig> to  <dig>  we modeled each cluster by using the smoothing splines technique with the knot number equal to  <dig> and the patterns are shown in figure  <dig>  the curves were smoother than the profiles in iyer et al.  <cit> , where the averages from the measures of the member genes for each cluster were used for graphical purposes.

we obtained the second clustering  by using a model-based clustering method  with bic criterion, in which the  <dig> genes  were divided into  <dig> clusters with the sizes ranking from  <dig> to  <dig>  in following analysis, the  <dig> cluster with  <dig> genes were not considered. it should be noted that the bic plot did not have the expected "u" shape in this application . therefore, the determination of the number of clusters was based on local minima of the score. the patterns of the clusters from ssclust are demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the use of partitioning around medoids  with silhouette score criterion  the third clustering  which contained  <dig> clusters with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes respectively.

a major difference between cl <dig> and cl <dig> was that the two big clusters in the former were divided into two or more smaller classes in the latter. for example, the aggregate of the cluster <dig> and cluster <dig> in cl <dig> approximately corresponded to the aggregate of the cluster <dig>  cluster <dig>  cluster <dig>  cluster <dig>  cluster <dig> and cluster <dig> in cl <dig>  in cl <dig>  the major   <dig> gens were classified into the first cluster, which largely corresponded to the first biggest cluster in cl <dig>  but the expression patterns of genes of these clusters were very different. therefore, implementation of pam with silhouette score criterion does not seem fit for the addressed dataset.

determination of q value
using the permutation method described in the methods section, the number of principal components to be considered, was chosen as q =  <dig> for all the three applications. figure  <dig> shows the results of a set of permutation tests with this parameter setting on the clustering  obtained by implementing ssclust, in which the proportion of the contrasts with p-value smaller than  <dig>  was approximately equal to this value. our previous simulation study showed that the proportion was far lower than  <dig>  when q =  <dig> and could be larger than  <dig>  when q ≥  <dig> in the cases with small sample size. therefore, this choice kept a balance between controlling the type i error and having high statistical power.

statistical evaluation of clustering
two-fold pc tests showed that all the contrasts between the clusters in cl <dig> were extremely significant . for cl <dig>  except for two contrasts  which had p-value larger than  <dig> , all other contrasts were statistically significant  . as mentioned in section  <dig> , the combination of the cluster <dig> and cluster <dig> in cl <dig> was approximately divided into  <dig> smaller classes in cl <dig>  the statistical significance between them demonstrated that the clustering in iyer et al.  <cit>  was inadequate for identifying distinguishable gene expression patterns over the time process. the case for cl <dig> was completely different from cl <dig> and cl <dig>  except for the contrasts between the fourth and fifth clusters and between the second and third clusters, all other contrasts were not significant . this provided support for the conclusion in the last section about the applicability of the pam method to the addressed data set.

biological evaluation of clustering
as mentioned above, the two big clusters in cl <dig> approximately corresponded to six smaller clusters in cl <dig>  but all the contrasts between these clusters were statistically significant . the question is whether more biological knowledge about the division of cl <dig> can be obtained from the division of cl <dig>  the biologically functional enrichment analysis  of the gene lists of eight clusters showed that the finer division  in cl <dig> represented more specific relationships between the clustering and biological function. for example, three clusters in cl <dig>  shared four of the ten panther biological processes  <cit>  which were enriched in the genes contained in the cluster <dig> in cl <dig> . a drawback of the finer division was that some small clusters, such as cl2- <dig> and cl2- <dig> could not be mapped to any biological function.

a the aggregate of cl- <dig> and cl- <dig> approximately corresponds to the combination of cl2- <dig>  cl- <dig>  cl- <dig>  cl- <dig>  cl- <dig> and cl- <dig>

discussion
clustering analysis is a widely used tool for knowledge discovery. moreover, it is applied as a routine method in biology in the post-genomic era. the evaluation of clustering is a problem in its application. in this study, we compared the results of different clustering algorithms from a unique angle by testing the statistical significance of the contrasts between the clusters. in our knowledge, this paper is the first investigation of this kind. we used q-fold pc test which is an implementation of lauter's exact f tests  <cit>  for the measures of multiple endpoints. the method is superior to hotelling's t <dig>  <cit>  because of the stabilizing effects of the principal components, especially for the data with small sample size. this is important when we want to identify highly-specific patterns via clustering analysis.

the significance of the proposed clustering evaluation includes three aspects. firstly, the results can tell us if the clustering is meaningful, at least from a statistical standpoint. a good clustering algorithm should meet a basic criterion, i.e., the clusters should be statistically distinguishable. in other words, all of the contrasts between the clusters should be statistically significant at a certain confidence level. second, it can be helpful in the determination of cluster numbers. for example, in the analysis of temporal gene expression data mentioned above, both the bic plot did not have the expected "u" shape. thus, the determination based on a local minimum value may be equivocal and questionable. the results of the pc tests demonstrated that dividing the  <dig> genes  into 18– <dig> clusters is appropriate. finally, the method is extremely useful for the improvement of the results from a clustering analysis by demonstrating which clusters can be combined because of the lack of significant difference between them.

the number  of principal components to be considered is a challenge for the pc test. we optimized the determination via validation according to permutation test based on the clustering to be evaluated. in this way, the choice of q is determined by the data and clustering methods. it is superior to the choice based on cumulative energy content  because the latter needs an artificial threshold of the cec percentage. more importantly, from the permutation test, we can assess the validity of the pc test itself in controlling type i error.

an alternative approach to the evaluation of clustering of genes based on the temporal expression profiling is biological validation. in this paper, we conducted biologically functional enrichment analysis of the gene lists of several clusters of interest. the results showed that the finer division of clusters from ssclust, a model-based clustering algorithm, can provide more specific relationships between clusters and biological functions.

it is worthy to note that the information from the biological validation is usually limited because the temporal gene expression profiles of the genes involved in a biological process can be very diverse, including, for instance, inverse co-regulation or co-regulation with a time lag or a combination of both  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the proposed pca test method was applied to a public dataset in classifying genes according to their temporal gene expression profiles. the results demonstrated that the pc testing were useful for determining the optimal number of clusters. we also anticipate that the method could be used for pattern identification and similarity analysis.
