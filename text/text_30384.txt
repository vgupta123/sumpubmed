BACKGROUND
gata-binding factor  <dig>  is a member of the gata family of zinc finger transcription factors that are characterized by their dna binding domain  <cit> . gata factors are highly conserved across vertebrate species, which include six members of the family  <cit> . they are also evolutionarily conserved among invertebrates  where they participate in heart and endoderm formation  <cit> . in humans, de novo mutations in the gata <dig> locus cause haploinsufficiency that is associated with congenital heart malformations and neonatal diabetes due to pancreatic agenesis .

during pre-implantation embryo development in mice, gata <dig> is required for formation of extra-embryonic tissues . in the early mouse blastocyst , gata <dig> protein is uniformly expressed in the inner cell mass  and trophectoderm   <cit> . by the mid-blastocyst  stage, expression of gata <dig> in the icm becomes restricted in a mosaic ‘salt-and-pepper’ pattern  <cit>  and co-localizes with gata <dig>  <cit> . at this stage, exclusive enrichment of gata <dig> serves as the earliest known determinant of the primitive endoderm  lineage, which is the precursor to the parietal endoderm  and visceral endoderm  . gata <dig> is necessary for pre specification in the mouse embryo, and either gata <dig> or gata <dig> are sufficient to promote differentiation into extra-embryonic endoderm from embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . gata6+/− heterozygotes have delayed pre specification and a reduction in the number of cells that adopt a pre fate at the late blastocyst stage  <cit> .

following implantation, strong gata <dig> expression continues in extra-embryonic tissues; namely the pare which deposits reichert’s membrane that lines the parietal yolk sac, and the allantois which will contribute blood vessels to the umbilical cord  <cit> . weaker expression of gata <dig> mrna can be observed in the ve that gives rise to the visceral yolk sac and a fraction of the embryonic gut endoderm, although gata <dig> protein levels in the ve are diminished by gastrulation stages  <cit> . tetraploid embryo complementation, where only the embryonic tissue was null for gata <dig>  demonstrated that gata <dig> is indispensible for embryonic liver development  <cit> . heart development in contrast does not require embryonic expression of gata <dig>  likely due to compensation by gata <dig>  which shares 90 % amino acid sequence homology with the dna-binding domain of gata <dig>  <cit>  and is also expressed in the myocardium  <cit> . when both factors are conditionally deleted, cardiac progenitors are specified even though the heart does not form  <cit> . gata6+/−;gata4+/− compound heterozygotes die by e <dig>  with cardiovascular anomalies  <cit> .

after gastrulation, gata <dig> is expressed in the cardiac crescent at the headfold stage , as well as in the lateral plate mesoderm, primary and secondary heart fields, and heart tube  <cit> . by e <dig> , gata <dig> expression is restricted to the heart myocardium and gut endoderm where it persists throughout development  <cit> . later onset of gata <dig> expression during development is observed in arterial smooth muscle cells, the bladder, lung bronchi, and the urogenital ridge; none of which co-express gata <dig>  <cit> . however, both gata <dig> and gata <dig> are expressed throughout the pancreatic epithelium during early specification and expansion. then, later in development their expression domains become mutually exclusive with gata <dig> restricted to cells of the endocrine pancreas  <cit> . when either factor alone is conditionally ablated in the pancreas, only mild and non-persisting defects are observed. however, tissue-specific deletion of both gata <dig> and gata <dig> factors results in pancreatic agenesis  <cit> .

in adult organs, gata <dig> expression continues in the heart, lung, stomach, small intestine, liver, bladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, ovaries, and skin . developmental expression of gata <dig> is extensive in the intestinal epithelium, but later becomes exclusive to the enteroendocrine lineage of adults  <cit> . gata <dig> is also the only gata family member that is expressed in adult vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . misregulation of gata <dig> has been linked to various tumor expression profiles. loss of gata <dig> is common in ovarian cancer and may lead to de-differentiation of ovarian epithelial cancer cells and increased occurrence of aneuploidy  <cit> . reduced gata <dig> activity may directly impact metastatic progression of lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> , while overexpression of gata <dig> is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma  <cit> . in colorectal cancer, high levels of gata <dig> predict the likelihood of metastasis to the liver  <cit> , and overexpression may promote survival of oncogenic cells in gastric cancer  <cit> . gata <dig> is also a useful marker of pediatric germ cell tumors  <cit> .

given the importance of gata <dig> as a key regulatory factor during development as well as in particular adult organs, it would be useful to have a method of identifying and tracing the fate of gata <dig> expressing cells. while other gata <dig> transcriptional lacz reporters exist  <cit> , a nuclear-localized fluorescent reporter instead would be suitable for live imaging and cell sorting. in this report, we describe a new gata6h2b-venus knock-in mouse line that acts as both a loss-of-function and transcriptional reporter allele. in mice, the bright nuclear-localized h2b-venus yellow fluorescent protein reporter correlates well with endogenous gata <dig> protein and recapitulates tissue-specific expression patterns from pre-implantation stages of embryonic development to adulthood. gata6h2b-venus will be a useful reporter for live imaging the dynamics of transcriptional activation in individual cells that are expressing, or recently have expressed gata <dig>  it could also be used for studies and analysis of gata <dig> expression in endoderm and mesoderm lineages in mice, including the isolation of these cell populations. furthermore, expression of gata6h2b-venus could be utilized to assess misregulation of the locus that may occur at the onset and/or as a consequence of disease states such as cancer.

RESULTS
generation of gata6h2b-venus knock-in reporter mice
an enhancer element located −8 kb from the gata <dig> transcriptional start site is sufficient to drive expression of gata <dig> in the heart and gut . to obtain a reporter that recapitulates the full spectrum of gata <dig> transcriptional control, we targeted the endogenous gata <dig> locus by modification of a eucomm knockout-first construct  <cit> . specifically, we targeted h2b-venus to the first non-coding intron of the mouse gata <dig> gene, upstream of two alternative translation initiation codons located 438 bp apart from one another within exon  <dig>   <cit> . targeted gata6h2b-venus/+ es cells were injected into mouse blastocysts to generate chimeric mice.fig.  <dig>

expression of venus was examined in es cells, which normally do not express gata <dig>  accordingly, the venus reporter was not detected in pluripotent gata6h2b-venus/+ es cells . to determine if gata6h2b-venus/+ performs faithfully as a reporter in cells, we directed the differentiation of es cells into endoderm, which expresses gata <dig>  using three different methods. first, gata6h2b-venus/+ es cells were cultured under conditions to promote formation of embryoid bodies, which are suspended aggregates of cells capable of differentiating into all three germ lineages. embryoid bodies did not initially express venus, however venus + cells were observed by day  <dig> in both endoderm cells located on the surface of the bodies as well as in mesoderm progenitors located inside . using growth factors, we also differentiated gata6h2b-venus/+ es cells into definitive endoderm. upon treatment with activin a, gsk <dig> inhibitor, and the bmp inhibitor dorsomorphin  <cit> , activation of venus was seen in gata6h2b-venus/+ cells starting at day  <dig> and increasing in frequency up to day  <dig> . finally, gata6h2b-venus/+ es cells were directed to differentiate towards a pre fate by transiently overexpressing gata4-mcherry, making use of a single-copy tet-on system for inducible gene expression formed by cola1teto-gata4-mcherry/+and r26m2rtta/+ alleles present in the background of reporter es cells  <cit> . upon treatment with doxycycline for 2 days, induction of gata4-mcherry was sufficient to activate expression of venus in gata6h2b-venus/+;cola1teto-gata4-mcherry/+;r26m2rtta/+ es cells .

expression of h2b-venus reporter is restricted to primitive endoderm
to assess venus expression in live embryos, gata6h2b-venus/+ blastocysts were collected at e <dig>  and imaged over the course of 17 h by laser scanning confocal microscopy. at these stages, venus was expressed in the icm and te at levels that were bright enough for live time-lapse imaging . furthermore, differential levels of nuclear venus signal within the icm were detected. to assess differential expression of venus in each blastocyst lineage, gata6h2b-venus/+ blastocysts were fixed at e <dig>   and e <dig>   and stained for endogenous gata <dig> . overall, cells that expressed venus also expressed gata <dig>  mainly in the pre. however, venus was present in gata6-negative cells in the icm, possibly due to translational repression mediated by sequences present in the wild-type gata <dig> mrna but not the reporter mrna, or as a consequence of the longer half-life of the h2b-venus reporter compared to gata <dig> protein. for example, notch signaling reporter mice also express an h2b-venus reporter and, in these mice, the perdurance of the reporter protein acts as a short-term lineage tracer of cells receptive to notch signaling  <cit> .fig.  <dig> venus and gata <dig> expression in blastocyst-stage embryos. a live imaging of gata6

perdurance of venus may explain low-level expression that continues in the epiblast  that may be prohibitive for its use as a pre-only reporter in the blastocyst, but could remain useful as a short-term lineage tracer. confocal z-stacks were segmented using the nuclear segmentation algorithm mins  to quantify fluorescence intensity in single cells. pre cells  displayed significantly higher levels of venus than epi cells at both blastocyst stages . furthermore, we observed a highly significant correlation between the level of gata <dig> and venus protein levels in pre cells at both e <dig>   and e <dig>  . at e <dig> , we also observed a weak, although significant correlation  between the levels of gata <dig> and venus in epi cells . the absence of correlation in epi cells at e <dig>   suggests that the correlation at e <dig>  may be due to residual gata <dig> protein found in epi cells at that stage.

gata6h2b-venus is a loss-of-function allele
to confirm that gata6h2b-venus is a loss-of-function allele for endogenous gata <dig>  gata6h2b-venus/h2b-venus blastocysts were immunostained for expression of gata <dig>  and nanog  at e <dig>  . at this time, gata <dig> and nanog expression begin to resolve into a mutually exclusive ‘salt-and-pepper’ expression pattern defining pre and epi precursors respectively. this occurs prior to lineage segregation in which pre cells are sorted to the surface while epi cells remain in the icm. gata6h2b-venus/h2b-venus homozygous blastocysts did not express gata <dig> protein and instead expressed nanog in all icm cells which fail to specify pre, similar to what was observed in mutants made with other gata <dig> null alleles   <cit> . the levels of venus in gata6h2b-venus/h2b-venus homozygous embryos were higher compared to gata6h2b-venus/+ heterozygous embryos . this could be due to bi-allelic expression of the reporter in homozygous embryos.fig.  <dig>

h2b-venus/h2b-venus homozygotes did not specify pre, and gata6
h2b-venus/+ heterozygotes had a relatively reduced number of cells with pre identity and increased numbers of double positive cells with undecided identity. gata6
h2b-venus/h2b-venus embryos with both alleles of the reporter, and effectively a gata <dig> null,  had higher levels of venus expression compared to gata6
h2b-venus/+ embryos with only one reporter allele. this would suggest that gata <dig> either does not regulate, or negatively feeds back on, gata6 gene expression.



early post-implantation expression of gata6h2b-venus
to assess the expression of gata6h2b-venus at early post-implantation stages, gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos were collected from e <dig>  to e <dig>  and immunostained for endogenous gata <dig> protein.

gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates except for their fluorescence. in wild-type embryos, gata <dig> protein was expressed throughout the extraembryonic ve  and embryonic ve  at e <dig> . venus was also detected in the ve at e <dig> , and optical sectioning confirmed that the reporter was not active in the epi or extra-embryonic ectoderm . at e <dig> , prior to formation of the primitive streak that is , expression of venus continued in throughout the ve. co-expression of gata <dig> and venus was observed in the emve on the surface of the embryo, but neither were detected in the epi or extra-embryonic ectoderm . however venus was not activated in all gata6+ cells of the ve, resulting in a mosaic pattern of venus expression in the exve  that was also evident at later stages . one possible explanation for this observation could be that the gata <dig> locus is subject to mono-allelic expression in certain tissues.fig.  <dig> co-expression of the gata6

activity of gata6h2b-venus during gastrulation
next, expression of venus was characterized during gastrulation stages. gastrulation begins at e <dig>  when epi cells in the proximal posterior portion of the embryo form the primitive streak . the ps is a region characterized by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition whereby ingression of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors results in their migration anterolaterally to populate the space in between two apposed epithelia, the epi and ve. at the early-streak  stage, venus was observed in the pare  upon bisection of decidua that contained gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos . expression of venus was mosaic in the ve at e <dig>  and mid-streak  stages of gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos, and did not always correlate with expression of endogenous gata <dig> . it is possible that expression of gata <dig> mrna and protein are dynamically changing in the ve at these stages. it is also possible that there are differences in translation regulation of gata <dig> mrna compared to the reporter mrna which lacks the wild-type 3′utr.fig.  <dig> expression of gata6

sections through the ps region at e <dig>  revealed venus and gata <dig> expression in cells that had left the epi epithelium . these cells may represent the earliest cardiac mesoderm progenitors that will populate the primary and secondary heart fields. to visualize movement of ingressed cells in vitro, we performed ps explants that were cultured and time-lapse imaged. the posterior portion of the epi was dissected from e <dig>  embryos, treated with pancreatin/trypsin enzymatic digestion to remove the endoderm and wings of mesoderm, and then cultured on fibronectin-coated chamber slides  <cit> . mesoderm precursors migrated away in a centrifugal fashion thus forming what is referred to as a mesodermal sheet that surrounded the original explant. when ps explants were cultured from gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos, migrating cells expressed venus, and individual nuclei could be identified and followed over time .

the next stage of development is defined by allantoic bud formation, axial extension from the node, and appearance of headfolds. at the late bud  and early headfold  stages, venus was expressed mosaically in the exve and throughout the emve. venus, together with endogenous gata <dig>  was strongly expressed in the anterior definitive endoderm, cardiac crescent, and lateral plate mesoderm . venus expression continued in the mesoderm, although it did not appear to coincide with brachyury in the posterior embryonic and extra-embryonic mesoderm at the early bud  stage, indicating that venus was labeling a specific sub-population of mesoderm and/or endoderm progenitors which was distinct from brachyury labeled cells . thus, as cells exit the primitive streak, they likely downregulate brachyury and activate gata <dig> fig.  <dig> expression of venus yellow fluorescence at allantoic bud and headfold stages. a wholemount immunofluorescence for gata <dig> on gata6

h2b-venus/+ embryos at early bud  stage. expression of venus is observed in lateral and anterior mesoderm and endoderm and is distinct from expression of brachyury. sections through the extraembryonic region  and embryonic region  are indicated by dashed lines on the schematic diagram to the right. a close-up of the region within the dashed white box shows expression of venus in the emve and nascent mesoderm , but not in the epi. three embryonic tissue layers  are delineated by dashed yellow lines. non-nuclear red fluorescent signal that appears apically on the ve is thought to be non-specific binding of the gata <dig> antibody to the surface of the extraembyonic tissue



exclusion of venus + endoderm cells from the midline was evident in ventral, frontal, and posterior views of gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos at headfold stages  . this was confirmed by immunostaining for brachyury and foxa <dig>  two transcription factors that are expressed along the midline at e <dig>   <cit> . trace expression of venus was detectable in the midline at early headfold  stages, likely due to perdurance. however, expression of venus mostly did not coincide with that of brachyury or foxa <dig> in the midline  as well as in the streak . at this stage , venus was expressed in both the mesenchyme and endoderm. expression in the endoderm was confirmed by colocalization with foxa <dig> in the surface endoderm .fig.  <dig> venus is expressed in the mesoderm and endoderm on the surface of the embryo, but not in the midline. a alternative views  depicting regions of venus expression  in gata6

gata6h2b-venus expression in later stage embryos and adults
from e <dig>   to e <dig>  , wholemount expression of venus was observed in the heart and gut endoderm . sections through gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos at e <dig>  revealed strong expression of the reporter in all regions of the gut, the heart myocardium, sinus venosus, and yolk sac. weaker expression of the reporter was observed in the pharyngeal mesenchyme. there were some discrepancies between endogenous gata <dig> and venus reporter expression. for example, the endocardium and the body wall, which derives from the lateral mesoderm, expressed low levels of gata <dig>  but did not express venus. conversely, gata <dig> appeared mostly downregulated in the yolk sac, although venus reporter expression was still robust . while this may reflect delays in the activation and/or downregulation of the reporter compared to the endogenous protein, it is also possible that the reporter may be retained more strongly in cells that are not actively dividing. similarly, faster growing tissues may dilute the reporter more rapidly.fig.  <dig> expression of venus at somite stages. a frontal and lateral views of wholemount gata6

by e <dig> , expression of venus was tissue-specific in gata6h2b-venus/+ embryos. low-level expression of venus was observed in the midgut epithelium whose derivatives express gata <dig> later on, but not in the foregut or hindgut. the heart myocardium and outflow tract continued to strongly express venus. additional sites of expression detectable at this stage included the stomach epithelium, pancreas, kidneys, lung epithelia, liver, gall bladder, urogenital ridge, arterial endothelium, and umbilical vessels. consistent with previous characterizations of endogenous gata <dig> expression  <cit> , venus was not observed in certain foregut-derived organs such as the esophagus and trachea .fig.  <dig> expression of gata6

in gata6h2b-venus/+ adults, expression of venus was observed in organs that have previously been reported to express gata <dig> . these include the heart, lung, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, ovaries, adrenal glands, stomach, and bladder. strong expression of venus within the skin was also observed . tissue sections of organs from gata6h2b-venus/+ mice revealed venus expression specifically in the mucosa and mesothelium of the corpus region of the stomach and small intestine, as well as expression within the pancreas and skin . gata6h2b-venus/+ heterozygous adult mice were not recovered at mendelian ratios , suggesting that adult gata6h2b-venus/+ heterozygous mice may have reduced viability.fig.  <dig> expression of gata6

CONCLUSIONS
our characterization of the gata6h2b-venus mouse line suggests that it should serve as a useful tool for single-cell resolution imaging of gata <dig> transcriptional activation in vivo. since this is also a loss-of-function allele, it can, in principle, be used in combination with a conditional  gata <dig> allele to trace the fate of gata <dig>  mutant cells after conditional cre-mediated ablation. bright, nuclear localization of the venus reporter allows for direct imaging of the fluorescent protein in fixed tissue samples without the use of an antibody, and also makes this reporter suitable for live imaging and cell tracking.

co-expression of gata <dig> and venus was well correlated in the embryo from the pre-implantation blastocyst to gastrulation and early somite stages of development. however, some differences were observed between the endogenous gata <dig> protein versus the venus-based transcriptional reporter in terms of levels and localization. for example, in gata6h2b-venus/h2b-venus homozygous null blastocysts, venus continued to report transcriptional activity in the absence of gata <dig> protein. these data suggest that gata <dig> does not feedback on its own transcription, and identify this transcriptional reporter as a readout of gata <dig> expression in the absence of protein function. however, it is also possible that some cells normally express gata <dig> mrna that is not translated into protein. in the future, this could be determined by quantitative real-time pcr or rna in situ hybridization to detect gata <dig> transcripts in specific cells in comparison with gata <dig> protein levels. alternatively, some of these differences may be due to stability of the venus protein, which may pose challenges for certain experiments. for example, since gata <dig> is activated in all icm cells prior to the sorting of epi and pre lineage progenitors into two distinct layers, then live imaging of the pre lineage may be difficult if low levels of venus perdure within epi progenitors.

in post-implantation embryos, mosaic activation of the gata6h2b-venus reporter in the exve at e <dig>  may potentially reflect mono-allelic regulation of the gata <dig> locus. this characteristic of the reporter could be utilized to investigate dynamics of the expansion of cells in the exve at early stages of post-implantation development that lead up to gastrulation. during gastrulation, venus brightly labels both mesoderm and endoderm progenitors and continues to be expressed in some of their derivatives, such as the cells that populate the heart field and gut endoderm. during organogenesis, venus is expressed in a tissue - specific manner in organ primordia that normally express endogenous gata <dig> 

in adult mice, the gata6h2b-venus allele may prove useful for studies of disease states, such as cancer models, in which gata <dig> activity may be aberrantly regulated. for example, the reporter may be silenced in tissues that normally express gata <dig>  alternatively, the reporter may be ectopically activated and changes in its activity levels may potentially correlate with progression of disease. gata6h2b-venus may also be used as a bright marker of specific cell populations within adult organs, such as in the skin, stomach and small intestine.

overall, the gata6h2b-venus allele should provide a useful tool for detecting transcriptional activation of the gata <dig> locus that correlates well with endogenous gata <dig> protein in both embryonic and adult mice, and can be used for the analysis and isolation of specific cell populations that normally express gata <dig>  noting the issue of venus perdurance, it would be of interest to re-target the gata <dig> locus with a destabilized fluorescent protein reporter in order to obtain an improved dynamic readout of gata <dig> transcriptional activity, and not only detect when gata <dig> is activated, but also to determine when the gene is turned off. a destabilized gata <dig> transcriptional reporter might be expected to be dimmer, but accordingly may provide better concordance between gata <dig> gene activity and reporter protein fluorescence. for example, the venus-nls-pest  fusion protein reporter  <cit>  has a short half-life and has been successfully used to monitor the transcriptional activity of genes, such as nanog, which are dynamically expressed  <cit> . similarly, if available, a gata6vnp allele could be useful for live quantitative imaging of the rapid changes in gata <dig> expression that occur during various cell lineage specification events involving gata <dig>
