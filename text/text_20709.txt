BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is a common, chronic and potentially debilitating form of autoimmune erosive arthritis. advances in the understanding of ra pathogenesis have led to the development of new and better treatments  <cit> . yet, sustained remission is still rarely achieved  <cit> , and more effective therapies are needed.

the identification of genes implicated in the regulation of arthritis severity and articular damage has the potential to generate new and potentially better targets for therapies aimed at preserving joint architecture and function, and reducing the risk of developing joint deformities. yet, little is known about those genes  <cit> , and the large cohorts of ra patients used in genome-wide association studies for susceptibility were not designed to address disease severity and articular damage.

we have previously identified several disease severity and articular damage quantitative trait loci  in rat models of ra  <cit> . using a combination of positional cloning and functional studies that include transcriptome analyses of synovial cells and synovial tissues we are beginning to understand the molecular processes regulating arthritis severity and joint damage in pristane- and collagen-induced arthritis   <cit> . similar strategies have been successfully used to identify other autoimmunity genes in rodent models  <cit> .

cia5a is a  <dig> mb qtl on rat chromosome  <dig> that regulates arthritis severity, cartilage and bone damage, synovial hyperplasia and inflammation in both pia and cia  <cit> . in the present study we used synovial tissues from arthritis-protected da.f <dig> congenics and from arthritis-susceptible and mhc-identical da rats in a microarray analysis of gene expression. we determined that the cia5a locus regulates the expression of several genes central to ra pathogenesis and joint damage, such as cytokines il1b and il <dig>  chemokines, proteases, mediators of the synthesis of reactive oxygen species and prostaglandins, and genes involved in toll-like receptor signaling. additionally, the expression of  <dig> members of the syk kinase pathway genes, including nfκb genes were significantly regulated by the cia5a locus. furthermore, the presence of f <dig> alleles at the cia5a interval was associated with increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes, including nuclear receptors and timp <dig>  suggesting that the cia5a locus contains a gene involved in maintaining an inflammation-free synovial tissue.

RESULTS
da.f <dig> congenics develop a mild form of pia with a distinct pattern of gene expression compared with da rats
da.f <dig> rats developed a significantly milder form of pia compared with da rats .


36%  of the genes in the ratref- <dig> beadchip were consistently expressed in synovial tissues. nearly one-third of these genes  met the filtering criteria for differential expression . the presence of f <dig> alleles at the cia5a interval, as in da.f <dig> congenic rats, was associated with increased expression of  <dig>  genes and reduced expression of  <dig>  genes compared with da.  <dig> genes had a ≥5-fold difference between strains .  <dig> genes had a ≥10-fold difference in expression, of which  <dig> were increased and  <dig> decreased in congenics, compared with da .

expression of pro-inflammatory genes, proteases  and adhesion molecules was significantly increased in da and decreased in da.f344
the  <dig>  genes with increased expression in da and reciprocally decreased expression in da.f <dig> congenics included pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines implicated in arthritis pathogenesis such as il1b , il <dig>  mif, ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> . genes with significantly decreased expression in congenics also included those implicated in the development of cartilage and bone erosions such as mmps , and other proteases  . interestingly, syk  has been shown to regulate the expression of differentially expressed mmps such as mmp <dig> <cit>  and mmp <dig> <cit> , further suggesting a potential central role for syk in arthritis and a syk-regulatory effect of cia5a. components of the extracellular matrix  also had reduced expression in congenics, and together with the levels of proteases suggested that there was reduced matrix turnover and reduced degradation, compared with arthritic da rats .


*t-test.

adhesion molecules required for leukocyte migration into the synovium were increased in da synovial tissues and decreased in da.f <dig>  including integrins itga <dig>  itgam, itgb <dig>  itgb <dig>  and cd <dig> . cadherin- <dig> , a fls-specific gene required for cell-cell interactions and implicated in fls invasion and synovial hyperplasia was also decreased in da.f <dig> congenics, consistent with the non-hyperplastic synovial tissue previously described in this strain, as opposed to the highly hyperplastic synovial tissue seen in da  <cit> .

the gene with the most significantly increased expression in da versus da.f <dig> was tnn . tnn has been implicated in osteogenesis and angiogenesis but not in arthritis or inflammation.

these results demonstrate that da rats with pia have increased synovial expression of many genes implicated in ra pathogenesis, further validating the molecular similarities between pia and ra, and underscoring the potential relevance of both cia5a in arthritis pathogenesis and the present study in discovering new key genes and pathways regulating arthritis.

increased expression of members of the syk  pathway in da synovial tissues, and reciprocally decreased expression in da.f344
 <dig> members of the syk pathway were expressed in significantly increased levels in da, and in reduced levels in congenics . these included: a) syk-activating receptors such as fcgr2a, fcer1g, integrins , c-lectin receptors , trem <dig> and dap <dig> , b) syk  itself, c) syk-interacting and downstream signaling genes including vav <dig>  lcp <dig> , ptk2b , lat, rac <dig>  and ezr , and d) genes belonging to pathways activated by syk and implicated in arthritis pathogenesis and synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation such as nfκb pathway genes , cytokines , genes implicated in cell proliferation , cytoskeleton regulation , and napdh oxidase complex genes implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species   .

additionally, syk and vav <dig> expression levels correlated with the cumulative arthritis severity score . taken together, these observations suggest that the cia5a qtl contains an arthritis gene that directly or indirectly regulates the expression of syk pathway genes, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for this locus’ effect on the regulation of disease severity.

da.f <dig> congenics have reduced synovial expression of innate immune response-activating genes, including members of the inflammasome
expression levels of genes implicated in innate immune responses were significantly increased in da, and decreased in da.f <dig>  in addition to the syk pathway, and mediators of ros synthesis, and regulators of cytokine transcription such as members of the nfκb pathways discussed above, da.f <dig> congenics also had reduced expression of ap- <dig> genes , il1b and other members of the inflammasome . pattern recognition receptors such as zbp <dig> and lgp <dig> , and components of the toll-like receptor  pathway  were expressed in increased levels in da and decreased in congenics. interestingly, and in line with these observations, the expression levels of negative regulators of tlr signaling such as ptpn <dig> and pparg was conversely increased in congenics, suggesting that the arthritis gene located within the cia5a qtl might mediate the balance between activating and inhibitory signals implicated in tlr signaling.

genes implicated in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes  were also increased in da , while genes that counteract eicosanoid-mediated inflammation  were increased in congenics .

increased expression of anti-inflammatory genes, including nuclear receptors , in synovial tissues from da.f <dig> congenics
several genes with known anti-inflammatory and cytokine-suppressing properties were expressed in increased levels in da.f <dig> synovial tissues, and reduced in da. these included the nrs lxra, pparg, rev-erba, rora, thra, and thrb .

scd <dig> was the gene with the most significantly increased expression in da.f <dig> congenics with a 55-fold difference compared with da . scd <dig> has been shown to reduce cytokine levels and to have anti-inflammatory activity  <cit> . we have previously reported that scd <dig> is expressed in significantly reduced levels in synovial tissues from rats with severe arthritis, and increased in the synovial tissues of yet another arthritis-protected congenic strain  <cit> .

adipoq and timp <dig>  which is an inhibitor of the tnfα converting enzyme , were two additional anti-inflammatory genes expressed in significantly increased levels  in da.f <dig> .

scd <dig> and some of the other genes up-regulated in da.f <dig> synovial tissues such as adipoq, cidea, cd <dig>  fabp <dig>  gpd <dig>  lpl, lpin <dig>  mgst <dig>  plin, pck <dig>  slc2a <dig> and srebf <dig>  are known to be inducible by nrs . these observations suggest that nrs were not only expressed in increased levels but also had increased activity in synovial tissues from da.f <dig> compared with da.

genes located within the cia5a interval have significantly different expression levels
 <dig> of the  <dig>  genes expressed by all samples were located within the cia5a interval.  <dig> of these  <dig> had increased expression in da synovial tissues, and  <dig> were increased in the congenics.  <dig> of these  <dig> differentially expressed genes had ≥2-fold-difference. sphk <dig> and sectm1b were the genes contained within the cia5a interval with the most significantly increased expression in da , while itgb <dig> and digr <dig> and were those with the most significantly increased expression in da.f <dig> congenics  . additionally, four genes located within the cia5a interval were expressed only or predominantly in da synovium, while two other genes were expressed predominantly in da.f <dig> . it is conceivable that these differences in expression levels of genes located within the cia5a interval could be explained at least in part by a polymorphism in the 5’ untranslated region  that affects a transcription factor binding site in cis, thus affecting transcription efficiency, or a 3’ utr polymorphism affecting mrna stability.

gene targets of micrornas  contained within the cia5a interval were not differentially expressed
the cia5a interval contains six predicted mirnas. we considered the possibility that polymorphisms in one of those six mirnas could account for the cia5a effect on gene expression and arthritis severity. in that case, such polymorphism would affect the mirna activity on the transcription of its target genes. therefore, we look for the differential expression of targets of all six predicted mirnas located within the cia5a interval. a list of target and non-target genes was generated for each of the six mirnas, but no significant over-representation of targets was detected , suggesting that polymorphisms affecting the expression or function of the mirnas contained within the cia5a interval are less likely to explain the differences in gene expression identified in this study.


analyses of cell type specific genes suggests synovial tissue cellularity differences between da and da.f <dig> congenics
 <dig> genes known to be specifically expressed by the cell types of interest to this study were used to compare da and da.f <dig> synovial tissues . the expression levels of those genes suggested increased numbers of fls , macrophages, dendritic cells , neutrophils and t cells in the synovial tissues of da, compared with congenics . no gene specific for b cells, nk cells or tregs were among those differentially expressed between the two strains, suggesting that the number of these cells in the synovial tissues of these two strains was not significantly different.

discussion
disease severity and articular damage are associated with increased risk for disability, joint deformities and reduced life expectancy in patients with ra  <cit> . yet, little is known about the genes implicated in the regulation of disease severity and articular damage genes in ra, and these genes could be the most relevant targets for new therapies aimed at preserving the joint architecture and function.

we have previously identified cia5a, a  <dig>  mb arthritis severity and joint damage regulatory locus, on rat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . cia5a co-localizes with other arthritis severity loci identified in other rodent models of arthritis such as oil-induced arthritis   <cit> , and cia in a daxaci intercross   <cit> . there have been no genome-wide association or linkage studies of disease severity and joint damage in ra, and therefore, it is unknown whether the cia5a syntenic region on human chromosome 17q22-q <dig> harbors a severity or joint damage arthritis regulatory gene. however, the human 17q22-q <dig> region contains a locus previously linked with ra susceptibility  <cit> . in the present study we analyzed synovial tissues from da rats, which develop severe arthritis  with pronounced synovial hyperplasia and cartilage and bone destruction, and synovial tissues from the da.f <dig> congenics, which develop mild and non-erosive disease. these two strains share the same mhc and are genetically identical except for the presence of f <dig> alleles at the cia5a interval, underscoring the magnitude of the effect of this single locus on clinical disease, on histologic joint damage  <cit>  and on gene expression . da.f <dig> congenics had significantly reduced expression of genes previously implicated in ra pathogenesis, ra severity and articular damage, including il1b, il <dig>  mif, mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  these and other similarities between da rats and ra synovial tissues’ gene expression, such as increased expression of chemokines, matrix proteins, adhesion molecules, mediators of innate immune responses, and others, underscore and further validate the potential clinical relevance of our model and discovery strategy.

we identified a new role for cia5a on the regulation of the expression of members of the syk pathway, where forty-seven genes directly or indirectly related to syk activation were expressed in increased levels in da, and significantly reduced levels in da.f <dig> congenics. syk is a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates itam motifs in trans-membrane receptors or adaptors, and interacts with partners like vav, pi3k and slp <dig> <cit> . syk activation mediates signaling through several cell surface receptors, including those with significantly different levels in this study such c-lectin type receptors, fcer1g, fcgr2a, trem <dig>  tyrobp, integrins, and the t-cell receptor  . resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells in the ra synovial pannus, such as mast cells, macrophages, b and t cells, express these syk-activating receptors. these resident cells and infiltrating cells have been implicated in arthritis pathogenesis and joint damage, raising the possibility that part of their effect may be mediated by syk-activating receptors.

analyses of cell-specific genes suggested reduced numbers of macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and t cells in the synovial tissues of congenics compared with da, which is in agreement with our previous histologic analyses and might explain part, but not all of the differences in expression of syk genes. additionally, da.f <dig> congenics had significantly lower levels of the fls-specific gene cdh <dig>  compatible with the reduced synovial hyperplasia that we have previously described.

syk pathway members regulate several cellular processes implicated in arthritis pathogenesis and articular damage, ranging from the production of reactive oxygen species, nfκb activation and the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators such as il1b and ccl <dig>  to the cell proliferation required for the development of synovial hyperplasia, and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements  <cit> . nfκb activity is regulated by syk and by several other pathways including tlrs and cytokine receptors  <cit> . the nfκb pathway has a central role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, il- <dig> and tnfα, in the development of synovial hyperplasia and in disease severity  <cit> . actin cytoskeleton rearrangements are also regulated by the syk pathway  <cit> , and are required for the migration of inflammatory cells into the synovial tissue, and for synovial cells and synovial tissue invasion and destruction of cartilage  <cit> . therefore, our observations suggest that a gene located within the cia5a interval is a new regulator of the expression of syk pathway genes implicated in key processes in arthritis pathogenesis.

the precise mechanisms whereby cia5a regulates the expression of syk genes remain unclear, and might reflect differences in tissue cellularity, multiple cell-activating processes, or a polymorphism in transcription factor located within the cia5a interval that affects transcription. studies by our group of synovial tissues obtained from four different congenic strains yielded different results in gene expression   <cit> , suggesting that the syk-regulatory effect of cia5a is a specific observation, and not simply related cellularity differences or inflammation.

syk has been recently implicated in arthritis pathogenesis and joint damage, and syk-deficient mice are protected from autoantibody-induced erosive arthritis  <cit> , and treatment with a syk inhibitor significantly reduced disease severity and joint erosions and damage in collagen-induced arthritis  <cit> . both the total and phosphorylated forms of syk are expressed in increased levels in ra synovial tissues compared with osteoarthritis, and syk inhibition reduced the expression of il- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  <cit> . more importantly, the use of a syk inhibitor significantly reduced disease activity in patients with ra  <cit> , with 67%, 43% and 28% of patients achieving acr <dig>  acr <dig> and acr <dig>  respectively, in a 3-month double-blind and placebo-controlled study  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that the syk pathway genes differentially expressed in this study could help identify patients more likely to benefit from therapy with syk inhibitors. additionally, syk is critical to tnfα-induced responses  <cit> , raising the possibility that the syk pathway 47-gene signature could be used to predict increased tnfα activity prior to choosing a biologic therapeutic agent. additionally, the increased expression of syk pathway genes could identify patients at increased risk to develop erosive disease and could become a prognostic tool. lastly, the cia5a gene itself has the potential to become a new target for therapies aimed at reducing articular damage via inhibition of syk pathway genes, including processes downstream from syk such as nfκb.

while several genes with pro-inflammatory, proteolytic, innate immunity and inflamasome-related activity were expressed in reduced levels in da.f <dig> congenics, groups of genes with known anti-inflammatory properties were expressed in increased levels in congenics. these genes included timp <dig>  ptpn <dig>  antagonists of reactive oxygen species  and nuclear receptors. nuclear receptors such as lxra, pparg and rora have been shown to interfere with nfκb and ap- <dig> activation  <cit> , and to have anti-inflammatory and arthritis-suppressive properties  <cit> . rxrg was another nuclear receptor expressed in significantly increased levels in da.f <dig> congenics. while rxrg itself has not been studied in the context of arthritis, it dimerizes with lxra, pparg, and with vdr, and is required for their anti-inflammatory activity. additionally, several nuclear receptor-inducible genes, including the inflammation-suppressor scd <dig> <cit>  were expressed in increased levels in the synovial tissues of the congenics. these observations suggest that not only nuclear receptor levels were increased, but also their activity. we have recently identified a similar nuclear receptor expression signature in another arthritis-protective congenic strain, da.aci  <cit> , suggesting that this effect is not specific to the cia5a locus, but more broadly correlates with preservation of both a normal synovial environment and articular architecture.

the gene with the most significantly increased expression in da compared with congenics was tnn . while little is known about this secreted extra-cellular matrix glycoprotein, it has been implicated in cancer-associated angiogenesis  <cit> , and in integrin-dependent cancer motility  <cit> . another member of the tenascin family, tenascin c , was recently shown to be an endogenous activator of tlr <dig>  an inducer of il- <dig> and tnfα, and was required for joint damage in arthritic mice  <cit> , suggesting that tnn could have a function similar to tnc in arthritis.

lastly, we considered the possibility that a polymorphism in the 5’ utr or 3’utr region of the gene accounting for cia5a could interfere with its transcription and/or mrna stability, respectively, leading to increased or reduced gene-specific mrna levels. we looked for differentially expressed genes and genes preferentially expressed by only one of the strains and located within cia5a as a clue to the above possibility. thirty-eight genes met these criteria, and particularly the most significant sixteen genes are interesting candidates that will be studied in detail .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in the present study we identified a pattern of gene expression regulated by cia5a, which included several inflammatory mediators and  <dig> members of the syk pathway. levels of several mediators of arthritis pathogenesis, synovial hyperplasia and articular damage were also reduced in da.f <dig> congenics, underscoring the importance of the gene accounting for this locus. increased expression of nuclear receptors correlated with joint preservation, and a new potential mediator of inflammation, tnn, was identified for the first time in synovial tissues. our observations suggest that the gene accounting for cia5a has the potential to become an important new target for therapies aimed at preserving joint architecture free of damage, and reducing inflammation.
