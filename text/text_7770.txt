BACKGROUND
foxl <dig>  was first implicated in human development as mutated in bpes , an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by eyelid/forehead anomalies associated with ovarian dysfunction leading to primary ovarian insufficiency . interestingly, in the gonad, it is also the only gene that has been found expressed uniquely in the ovary compared to the testis, and likely functions as an antagonist of the testis-determining sox <dig> in gonadal development  <cit> . in humans, sox <dig> haploinsufficiency causes campomelic dysplasia , a syndrome showing partial xy sex reversal and defects in the development of the reproductive and skeletal systems .

in the wild-type  mouse, foxl <dig> is strongly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells starting at  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . related to its effect on eyelids, at  <dig>  dpc, foxl <dig> is expressed in the cranial neural crest cells  and cranial mesenchymal cells  of the mesencephalon region around the developing eye until eyelid fusion . then its expression in the eyelids decreases to levels barely detectable at birth  <cit> . foxl <dig> is also expressed in the gonadotropic cells of the pituitary gland at  <dig>  dpc and in the thyrotropic and gonadotropic cells of the adult pituitary  <cit> ; in the dorsal maxillary first branchial arch ; and in a delimited domain at the maxillary-mandibular junction at  <dig>  dpc  <cit> .

foxl2−/− mice showed craniofacial and gonadal features reminiscent of human bpes, including eyelid anomalies in both sexes and sterility in females resulting from a complete failure of follicle formation , along with up-regulation of testis-determining genes  and partial sex reversal . the sex reversal is more pronounced in adult mice conditionally deleted for foxl <dig>  <cit> .

ablation of the foxl <dig> gene in mice, however, showed additional phenotypes, including smaller body size in both males and females along with a 60 % reduction in igf <dig>  serum levels  <cit> .

RESULTS
previous work reported that many foxl2−/− mice died soon after birth, and survivors were relatively small and had reduced igf <dig> serum levels  <cit> . observation of a much larger number of animals has now allowed us to quantitate female fertility and the survival and growth characteristics of offspring. fertility in foxl2+/− female mice was statistically significantly lower, with foxl2−/− litter sizes about 40 % those of wt. newborn pups showed expected mendelian frequencies of wt and foxl2−/− mice , but with a high rate of postnatal death  associated with seizure-like episodes of unknown causation.

here we further detail the effects of loss of foxl <dig> on mouse growth, and concomitant effects in craniofacial, bone and cartilage development.

to avoid possible additional effects of unbalanced female sex hormone levels on the phenotypes under study, we focused on foxl2−/− males.

small adult size of foxl2−/− mice results from weak pubertal growth spurt
a longitudinal study further analyzed foxl2−/− mice body size during growth. body weight and length at birth were equivalent in wt and foxl2−/− siblings. during the first 100 days of life, growth is clearly triphasic in wt mice, as expected. as already described, an early neonatal growth period  is followed by a period of considerable decline in growth rate followed by a growth spurt after weaning  <cit> . however, in wt mice, growth simply slows during the intermediate period while it essentially stops in foxl2−/− mice. also, the subsequent growth spurt, which starts about p <dig> in wt, was delayed to ~p <dig> in foxl2−/− mice .fig.  <dig> comparison of postnatal weight-growth curves and igf1/gh axis gene expression in wt and foxl2
−/− mice.  growth curves of wt and foxl2
−/− show significant differences in body weight starting at p21- <dig>  indicated by a dotted line .  growth rates show the different trends between p <dig> and p <dig> : decline is greater in foxl2
−/− than in wt with delay of the subsequent growth spurt.  rt-qpcr in foxl2
−/− mice at p <dig> shows increased expression of ghrh in hypothalamus,  reduced expression of both ghrhr and gh in pituitary gland, and  reduced expression of igf <dig> in skull vault and liver



at p <dig>  weight and length differences between wt and foxl2−/− mice became significant . by p <dig> foxl2−/− body weight and length were respectively  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % lower than wt.

weight at successive time points was used to transform absolute rates to specific growth rates . the specific growth rate was greater in wt than in foxl2−/− until about p <dig>  when they became comparable; thereafter, all mice tended toward a steady state. parallel analysis of body length showed similar and significant, though less marked results .

the gh/igf <dig> axis is impaired in foxl2−/− mice
because igf <dig> serum levels were lower in foxl2−/−, we explored the possibility that aberrant growth in these mice could result from alteration of the gh/igf <dig> axis  <cit> . real-time quantitative pcr  detected foxl <dig> expression in p <dig> wt hypothalamus, pituitary gland and skull vault, but not in liver. in particular, setting foxl <dig> expression in hypothalamus to  <dig>  in skull vault and pituitary it was respectively  <dig> to 244-fold higher.

in the same tissues of wt and foxl2−/− mice, we evaluated the expression of several hypothalamic-pituitary-bone axis markers . in foxl2−/−, up-regulation of ghrh  was found in hypothalamus, whereas down-regulation was observed for ghrh-r  and gh  in pituitary gland, and for igf <dig> in both skull vault and liver .

characterization of foxl2−/− skeletal phenotype
at birth foxl2−/− mice could be clearly distinguished from wt littermates only by overt eyelid hypoplasia/open eyes. by 2– <dig> weeks, however, they also showed short snout and cross-bite . foxl2−/− incisors grew continuously, and the resultant cross-bite precluded normal trimming. to favor their survival we cut the lower incisors every 2 days starting at about p13-p <dig>  from 4 weeks and thereafter throughout life, size differences were accompanied by pronounced hyperlordosis/hyperkyphosis .

skeletal preparations stained with alcian blue/alizarin red clearly showed aberrant cranial bone formation from birth in foxl2−/− mice . by 4 weeks the head was patently shorter, visible in both ventral  and lateral views , with reduced development of maxillary, premaxillary, and nasal bones. the dome-shaped skull along with the relatively normal-sized mandibular bone and other small facial bones resulted in the pronounced cross-bite. the shape of the zygomatic arch, formed by maxillary, jugal and squamosal bone, was compromised, and coronal and sagittal suture was missing . by 4 weeks, differences in size, vertebral column and pelvic girdle were also clearly visible by autoradiography and alizarin red staining . adult foxl2−/− skeletons were stained more lightly by alizarin red than were wt , suggesting osteopenia .fig.  <dig> cranial skull defects in the adult foxl2−/− mouse.  ventral,  lateral view of mice head in radiography and  in alcian blue/alizarin red staining showing difference in size, short snout with resulting short philtrum and crossbite in foxl2
−/−. white lines in c and d underline the lack of ethmoid bone .  it is evident the abnormal shape of the zygomatic arch, formed by the malar process of maxillary, zygomatic and squamosal bone. the black arrowheads in d and f indicates frontal bossing.  dorsal view of foxl2
−/− skull shows alterations in the sagittal and interfrontal sutures and coronal craniosynostosis.  cranial sutures are indicated as: l, lambdoid; s, sagittal; c, coronal; if, interfrontal. scale bar = 1 cm

−/−. kyphosis and domed skull are evident .  ventral  and dorsal  views of the pelvic girdle show in foxl2
−/− different shape and lack of sacralization in 4-5s . scale bars = 1 cm



foxl2−/− vertebrae showed characteristically smaller spinous processes, and sacralization failed at sacral vertebrae 2– <dig> in the pelvic girdle . differences did not extend, however, to the appendicular skeleton, which appeared normal at all stages in foxl2−/− mice.

foxl2−/− mice had retarded skeletal development and defective cartilage maturation
to trace the origins of skeletal abnormalities observed in newborn and adult mice, we examined wt and foxl2−/− embryos.

at  <dig>  dpc, alcian blue/nuclear fast red coupled with von kossa staining showed impaired vertebral condensations in foxl2−/− mice. also, mesenchymal tissue arising from mesoderm appeared generally disorganized and cell-poor . in particular, the intervertebral mesenchyme, from which chondroblasts originate to form prevertebrae, was sparse. furthermore, alcian blue staining was faint, suggesting delayed/reduced formation of condensed cartilage.fig.  <dig> analysis of cartilage maturation and bone mineralization in wt and foxl2−/− embryos.  at  <dig>  dpc, alcian blue/nuclear fast red coupled with von kossa staining shows impaired vertebral condensations in the foxl2
−/− mouse, with reduced intervertebral mesenchyme and disorganized mesenchymal tissue .  at  <dig>  dpc in foxl2
−/− mice sox <dig> expression shows a lack of definition of the vertebral condensations , with the prevalence of dispersed sox <dig> marked cells in intervertebral mesenchyme .  at  <dig>  dpc, alcian blue/nuclear fast red coupled with von kossa staining of mandibular bone surrounding meckel cartilage  shows the initial mineralization only in the wt mouse, indicated by white arrowhead.  100x magnification relative to the boxed areas in figures e and f.  at  <dig>  dpc, alcian blue/nuclear fast red coupled with von kossa staining  and immunostaining with antibody to sox <dig> , revealed retarded mineralization in foxl2
−/− vertebral column , with sox <dig> still expressed in the vertebral bodies , suggesting a delay in mineralization process. retarded mineralization was also evident in foxl2
−/− frontal  and basoccipital bone . vc, vertebral condensations; im, intervertebral mesenchyme; mt, mesenchymal tissue; mk, meckel cartilage; np, nucleus pulposus; vb, vertebral bodies. magnifications 20x, scale bar =  <dig> um for all figures except for e <dig>  f <dig> with magnifications 100x and scale bar =  <dig> um



at  <dig>  and  <dig>  dpc, disordered maturing cartilage was obvious in the thoracic vertebrae of foxl2−/−; by that time blue staining was already highly intense in wt, reflecting the change in cartilage as it becomes calcified . at  <dig>  dpc the foxl2−/− vertebral body showed a relative lack of mineralization .

delayed mineralization  was seen at  <dig>  dpc in the mandibular bone around the meckel cartilage , and at  <dig>  dpc in the frontal  and basoccipital bones .

these results indicated a delay in skeletal development and defects in cartilage maturation. to test this inference further, we performed immunofluorescence with antibody to sox <dig>  a well-established regulatory factor and marker of maturing  chondrocytes at all stages   <cit> . at  <dig>  dpc in wt mice, sox <dig> was already expressed in chondrocytes in vertebral condensations , while in foxl2−/−, its decreased expression confirmed the reduction of intervertebral spaces and the poorly defined vertebral condensations . at  <dig>  dpc in wt, sox <dig> positive cells were localized, as expected, only in the intervertebral spaces  while in foxl2−/− they were still scattered in the vertebral body . these results are all consistent with delays in chondrocyte maturation and mineralization .

foxl <dig> expression in wt developing skeletal tissues
foxl <dig> has a characteristic temporal and spatial pattern of expression in several tissues . here we extended the analysis of foxl <dig> expression to look at developing wt skeletal tissues.

by rt-qpcr foxl <dig> showed different levels of expression in tail, vertebral column and leg at  <dig>  dpc, and in skull vault at p <dig> and p <dig> . confirmatory foxl <dig> protein expression was detected by western blot analysis on the same tissues .fig.  <dig> foxl <dig> expression in wt mouse at different stages of development.  rt-qpcr shows different levels of foxl <dig> expression in tail, vertebral column and leg at  <dig>  dpc and in skull vault at p <dig> and p <dig>   schematic view of a  <dig>  dpc mouse embryo. red lines indicate the position of sections shown in c and d.  localization by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy shows foxl <dig> in green, and nuclei in red.  at  <dig>  dpc foxl <dig> expression is mainly observed in migrating mesenchymal cells  and in the caudal neural tube .  magnification of the region boxed in d.  at  <dig>  dpc foxl <dig> expression is seen in the head near the nascent skull, where several foxl <dig> positive cells are dispersed in the mesenchymal tissue.  magnification of the region shown in e. arrowhead in g indicates a migrating cell.  pre-cartilagineous tissue of the first cervical vertebra.  at  <dig>  dpc foxl <dig> expression is revealed in vertebral column , ribs , hip , and finger . nte, neural tube epithelium; hm, head mesenchyme; vb, vertebral bodies; im, intervertebral mesenchyme; r, ribs; h, hip; f, finger. scale bars:  =  <dig> um,  10x =  <dig> um,  40x =  <dig> um,  63x =  <dig>  um,  63x plus digital zoom  <dig> x =  <dig>  um



by confocal microscopy at  <dig>  dpc we observed foxl2-containing cells dispersed in the neural tube epithelium, from whose dorsal region the neural crest cells  originate. positive cells were also found dispersed in head mesenchyme. in particular, they were seen around neural epithelium . at  <dig>  dpc foxl <dig> was still expressed in head mesenchyme  and in all pre-cartilaginous tissues of the cervical pre-vertebrae .

at  <dig>  dpc only weak foxl <dig> expression was observed in all cartilage . it became stronger in all nascent cartilage , and particularly in proliferating chondrocytes, as suggested by the position of marked cells within nascent bones, from  <dig>  dpc  to  <dig>  dpc . to characterize the nature of foxl2-containing cells we used sox <dig> as a marker of nccs, pre-chondrogenic mesenchyme and chondrocytes . immunostaining with antibodies to sox <dig> and foxl <dig> on consecutive sections revealed overlapping expression in head mesenchyme at  <dig>  dpc and in thoracic vertebrae at  <dig>  dpc . as observed previously , sox <dig> expression was restricted to vertebral bodies, whereas foxl <dig> showed broader expression that extended to the intervertebral mesenchyme.fig.  <dig> foxl <dig> and sox <dig> expression in wt embryos.  localization by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy shows foxl <dig>  and sox <dig>  in green, and nuclei in red at  <dig> . both are expressed in the head mesenchyme.  magnification of the regions shown in a and b. dotted lines in a <dig> and b <dig> highlight respectively foxl <dig> and sox <dig> positive cells, located in the same region of consecutive sections.  alcian blue staining , foxl <dig> and sox <dig> immunofluorescence in consecutive sections of a  <dig>  dpc embryo .  foxl <dig> positive cells are present within the vertebral bodies  and in the intervertebral mesenchyme .  by contrast, sox <dig> is localized only within the vertebral bodies ; scale bars:  10x =  <dig> um,  40x =  <dig> um,  63x =  <dig>  um. vb, vertebral bodies; im, intervertebral mesenchyme



gene expression profiling to assess foxl <dig> action on skull mineralization
to assess molecular changes correlated with the marked foxl2-dependent effects on skull mineralization, we performed gene expression profiling focusing on the stage of intramembranous ossification and bone formation at sutures.

microarray expression profiling was carried out on skull vault rna from wt and foxl2−/− mice at p <dig> and p <dig>  differentially expressed genes were analyzed by parametric analysis of gene set enrichment . we found significantly deregulated pathways  that included those related to bone, cartilage and connective tissues disorders . microarray results were validated by rt-qpcr performed on  <dig> sample genes chosen with absolute z-ratios ranging from +/−  <dig> to +/−  <dig> .

the most down-regulated pathways in foxl2−/− were linked to pathologies such as amyloid neuropathies  related to the ttr gene . rt-qpcr showed down-regulation of ttr stronger at p <dig> than at p <dig> in foxl2−/−, with z-ratio of − <dig> . ttr is a carrier protein that transports thyroid hormones in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and retinol  in plasma. ttr−/− mice are a model for augmented neuropeptide y  action, involved in the regulation of bone formation and in increased bone mass  <cit> . consistent with these data, expression profiling found npy up-regulated in foxl2−/− .

in addition, pair-wise comparisons between wt and foxl2−/− consistently showed down-regulation of pathways related to bone diseases, and up-regulation of those related to cartilage and connective tissues . this is consistent with the dysregulation of mineralization and chondrocyte development. drilling down to genes within those pathways, col1a <dig>  col2a <dig>  ryr <dig>  fbn <dig>  tnfrsf11b and igf <dig> were the most deregulated. interestingly, along with igf <dig>  its receptor igf1-r and its binding proteins were also aberrant . sox <dig> was only slightly down-regulated both at p <dig> and p <dig> , a trend confirmed by rt-qpcr . in addition, two genes, dner and dtx <dig>  related to the “notch binding” pathway showed up-regulation in foxl2−/− at p <dig> and p <dig>  strongly implicating foxl <dig> in that developmental pathway.

discussion
in addition to its role in eyelid and ovary development, we characterize foxl <dig> effects on body growth and craniofacial and skeletal development, including cell lineage commitment in cartilage and bone formation. we infer that foxl <dig> has complex pleiotropic action resulting in putative secondary cross-talk effects.

foxl2-dependent effects on body growth through the gh/igf <dig> axis
gh regulates important physiological processes, including somatic growth and development, directly through the activation of specific gh receptors , or indirectly through igf <dig>  which is mainly produced in the liver in response to gh stimulation . it acts in a paracrine fashion in most tissues. null mouse models for gh and igf <dig> show growth defects, but with no marked skeletal abnormalities apart from a partial defect in long bone mineralization  <cit> .

the growth curves described here can be rationalized on the basis of the lower activity of the gh/igf <dig> axis in the foxl2−/− mice. suggestively, growth retardation associated with gh deficiency has also been described in some bpes patients, indicating possible evolutionary conservation of effects of foxl <dig> on the gh/igf <dig> axis  <cit> . concerning possible mechanisms, ghrh expression is normally regulated by gh in a negative feedback loop. consistent with the gh deficit observed in foxl2−/− pituitary glands, ghrh was up-regulated in the foxl2−/− hypothalamus. thus, the negative feedback of gh on the ghrh pathway was sharply reduced. the lower expression of foxl2-mediated gh and ghrh-r in the pituitary, where they are normally expressed, could account for the reduction of igf <dig> levels in liver, bone/skull vault and serum. however, foxl <dig> is not expressed in somatotropes cells, so that the reduction of gh and ghrh-r in foxl2−/− is likely indirect  <cit> .

growth reduction in foxl2−/− mice is accounted for by the attenuation/delay of the postnatal growth spurt that usually starts at about 2 weeks. notably, that coincides with the initiation of gh action.

foxl2−/− growth curves resemble those of mice ablated for gh and ghr, which also show an initial growth phase identical to wt  <cit> . foxl <dig> action on the gh/igf <dig> axis is further supported by expression profiling, with genes belonging to the igf binding pathway among those down-regulated at p <dig> in foxl2−/− skull vault preparations.

recently shi et al. reported the growth phenotype of mice where a piggybac  insertion in a region approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the foxl <dig> transcription start site, reduced foxl <dig> expression resulting in a bpes-like phenotype  <cit> . growth inhibition was also observed in that model, though the growth curves deviated earlier than in our foxl2−/− model . such differences in growth rate are likely attributable to the different types and penetrance of the lesions in the two mouse models.

we note that the lack of foxl <dig> in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland did not disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal  axis, because foxl2−/− male were fully fertile  <cit> . foxl <dig> promotes normal expression of fsh , but it may be that there is also a foxl2-independent transcriptional mechanism, thus far uncharacterized  <cit> . also consistent with the inference that foxl2−/− phenotypes are mainly independent of the pituitary/ovarian axis is the lack of growth and skull anomalies in mice lacking fsh and fsh-r , which are key factors in hpg action .

foxl2-dependent effects on craniofacial/skeletal development
cranial skeletogenic mesenchyme is derived from two distinct embryonic sources, cephalic paraxial mesoderm and cranial neural crest. craniofacial/skeletal pathology and impaired ossification in foxl2−/− mice can be correlated with the lack of foxl <dig> expression at  <dig>  dpc in the neural tube epithelium and in the head mesenchyme, which includes cnccs and cmcs originating from paraxial mesoderm. those cells act as a transient multipotent cell population that can migrate and yield many different cell types in vertebrate organs, including facial cartilage and bone  <cit> . craniofacial development begins when cnccs, multipotent precursors that contribute to much of the face, delaminate from the dorsal brain. they then migrate ventrolaterally to form the ectomesenchyme of facial primordia, also known as the frontonasal prominence, and bas. how cnccs recognize positional information and consequently develop is beginning to be understood . foxl <dig> expression in the neural tube epithelium and in the head mesenchyme suggests its involvement in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition  and in subsequent mesenchymal cell commitment to chondrocytes and/or osteoblasts. thus, skull malformations such as those reported here and in other recent papers  <cit>  could be expected in foxl2−/− mouse models.

cnccs maintenance and processes, that include cell fate determination and migration, are mediated by notch signaling . in particular, notch is an important regulator of skeletogenesis, promoting proper skeletal development by effecting somite segmentation, patterning and differentiation into the sclerotome pre-chondrogenic cells. notch also suppresses chondrogenic and osteoblastic differentiation and negatively regulates osteoclast formation and proliferation  <cit> . activation of aberrant notch signaling has been shown to result in the down-regulation of foxl <dig> in eyelid development, hinting that foxl <dig> may participate in the potent developmental pathway initiated by notch  <cit> . this is consistent with our findings. interestingly, a report of possible enhancer sequences active in the developing craniofacial complex identified a putative regulatory site for foxl <dig> as well as for notch <dig> and notch <dig>  <cit> .

gene expression analysis identified ttr, known to be involved in familial amyloid polyneuropathy , as one of the genes most down-regulated in foxl2−/− skull vault. ttr is a plasma protein that delivers retinol to tissues, where its metabolic product retinoic acid is essential for craniofacial morphogenesis. lack of ttr in mice results in up- regulation of npy, which is involved in the regulation of bone formation. this is in line with our data, which showed overexpression of npy in foxl2−/−. furthermore, clinical features of ttr-related amyloidosis include seizures and stroke-like episodes, reminiscent of our observations of seizure-like episodes that are associated with foxl2−/− postnatal death. speculatively, foxl <dig> may directly regulate ttr expression in bone and/or in the nervous system, and thereby affect the phenotypes reported here.

deregulation of genes related to skeletal/growth phenotypes was found in all pair-wise comparisons of wt and foxl2−/− mice skull vaults; however, it remains unclear whether foxl <dig> participates directly or indirectly in the regulation of these genes.

foxl <dig> and sox9: antagonists in gonads, parallel regulators in bone development
the overall foxl <dig> pattern of expression is strikingly analogous to that of sox <dig>  in addition to the well-known antagonism of foxl <dig> and sox <dig> in sex determination, our results reveal a new putative parallel action of these two factors in skeletal development. in the absence of sox <dig>  chondrocyte differentiation is blocked both at the stage of mesenchymal condensation and during hypertrophic maturation  <cit> . the impaired development of pre-cartilaginous mesenchyme along with premature skeletal mineralization and malformations seen in foxl2−/− resemble features described for sox9+/− mice  <cit> .

possible parallel action of foxl <dig> and sox <dig> in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis is consistent with the first expression of both in the head mesenchyme -- with sox <dig> expression demonstrated in particular in the nccs -- and thereafter in mesenchymal condensations associated with deposition of cartilage. sox <dig> has thus been proposed to have a primary role in osteoblast maturation and skeletal formation  <cit> . currently, sox <dig> is considered a neural crest specifier: its inactivation does not affect nccs migration, but causes the loss of chondrogenic potential of nccs. consequently, inactivation of sox <dig> in nccs results in complete absence of derived cartilage and endochondral bones  <cit> . at  <dig>  dpc sox <dig> is found in cartilage, whereas foxl <dig> is also activated in mesenchymal cells surrounding the cartilage primordium. although mechanistic details remain unknown, foxl <dig> might thus act on cell differentiation/commitment. this would concur with the deregulation of a large number of bone/cartilage developmental pathways and genes in foxl2−/− skull vaults at p <dig> and p <dig> 

overall, the spectrum of action of foxl <dig> and sox <dig> overlaps only partially. for example, there is no evidence that sox <dig> acts through the gh/igf <dig> axis. nevertheless our data suggest that these factors may both act as master genes in bone and cartilage, contributing to a “modular” specification of lineages that is analogous to the complex specification of cell lineages in the gonad  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive study of our foxl2−/− mouse model allowed us to infer complex pleiotropic roles of foxl <dig>  besides its well-known function on ovarian and eyelid development, foxl <dig> action on mouse growth seems to be mediated predominantly or exclusively by its effect on the gh/igf <dig> axis. it remains to be clarified whether foxl <dig> effects on the gh/igf <dig> axis are direct or indirect . however, concomitant action on bone and cartilage development appears to operate by a mechanism independent of igf <dig> and complementary to sox <dig>  foxl <dig> thus may orchestrate complex regulatory events during craniofacial, bone and cartilage development by mechanisms now open to further explication.
