BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are of great therapeutic potential because of their ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple tissues <cit> . they enhance engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells after co-transplantation in animal models <cit> . in humans, msc have been used to regenerate the marrow microenvironment after myeloablative therapy <cit> . possible clinical applications proposed for msc include: stem cell transplantation <cit> , stem cell strategies for the repair of damaged organs <cit>  and gene therapy <cit> . friedenstein first described <cit>  msc in bone marrow  as a very rare population , and wexlel et al <cit>  reported a  <dig> in  <dig>  ×  <dig> frequency for these cells. we estimated that about  <dig> in  <dig>  ×  <dig> bone marrow mononuclear cells are msc . their level is even lower in cord blood <dig> and peripheral blood. thus, it is essential to culture and populate msc in vitro before putting them to therapeutic use. scientific literature state that telomere length shortens after each division cycle. this leads to a gradual senescence. however, in vitro culture has proven that environmental conditions and differing treatment significantly increase or decrease culture life span. it seems as though depending on conditions cells are exposed to, rate of decrease in telomere length varies, leading to the observed differences. for example, van zglinicki et al reported that cells incubated in 40% oxygen soon stopped growing and, at the same time, had shortened telomeric dna. they showed that telomeric dna can be lost without cell division, perhaps by single-strand breaks in dna <cit> .

with this in mind, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of long term invitro culture on the proliferation, differentiation, telomere length, phenotype, and morphology of these cells.

RESULTS
the results of msc culture
three days after plating bm mononuclear cells in culture flasks, the mean number of fibroblast like cells were about  <dig>  of total heterogeneous cells. gradually, the fibroblast like cells  increased and the heterogeneous cells decreased in the culture.

the predominant cell after  <dig> weeks of culture was fibroblast like  and dislodged readily on trypsinization in  <dig> minutes.

primary culture took between  <dig> and  <dig> days . the total count of harvested cells from primary culture was between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> . the mean number of harvested msc and the mean time of confluency from the second culture on is shown in table  <dig>  as can be seen in table  <dig>  the average number of cells that proliferate during each passage and the average confluency time in the various passages are different. to analyze these differences we performed the repeated measurement analysis of variance statistical test, but we did not find any significant difference between the different passages.

to evaluate whether donor age affects in vitro cell senescence, we divided our donors into two groups. the first group included  <dig> individuals under the age of  <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> who were between the ages of 23– <dig> made up the second group.

independent sample test and repeated measurement analysis was performed to evaluate telomere length, pd level, harvested cell dose and confluency time for each passage. no significant difference was observed.

the goal of this study was keeping the msc in the culture by multiple passages up to  <dig> days. nine of the  <dig> samples survived between  <dig> and  <dig> days and were passaged between  <dig> to  <dig> times. two samples survived up to  <dig> and  <dig> days, and were passaged  <dig> and  <dig> times respectively .

immunophenotype of msc
the mean percent of cd expression of the three antigens in  <dig> different passages was compared using repeated measurement analysis of variance test. results demonstrate no significant difference in their expression. these cells stained positively for cd <dig> and cd <dig> but negative or very low positive for cd <dig> 

differentiation of bm msc
msc were differentiated along adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. oil red o staining for adipocyte and van kossas and alkaline phosphatase staining for osteocyte were positive . adipogenic differentiation of msc after 2– <dig> weeks incubation in adipocyte culture media demonstrated scattered aggregates of oil red o positive staining cells. but within the same time limit, the osteocyte culture media exhibited a homogeneous and relatively abundant number of van kossas positive cells.

the differentiation ability of msc varied in the  <dig> different passages. every one of the samples cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic mediums differentiated to osteocyte and adipocytes by the 4th culture. in the 8th passage, 25% , and in the 10th passage, 20%  of the samples lost their osteogenic differentiation potential. for adipocytes, in the 6th passage 10% , in the 8th passage 50% , and in the 10th passage 60%  of the samples lost their adipogenic differentiation potential. the percentage of samples with the ability to differentiate into osteocyte and adipocyte in advancing cpd is shown in table  <dig> 

long-term growth kinetics
to examine long-term growth kinetics of msc culture, we measured cumulative population doublings , with respect to the passage number in multiple donors. the average number of cumulative pd in  <dig> days was about  <dig> . msc underwent an average of  <dig>  pds prior to the first passage. the mean pd and growth kinetics of different samples upon subsequent passages is shown in table  <dig> and figure 1d, respectively.

morphological characteristics of bm msc in long-term culture
after a long period of normal growth, msc culture showed abnormalities typical of the hayflick model of cellular aging in cultured human fibroblasts  <dig>  the cells varied in size and shape, the cytoplasm began to be granular with many cell inclusions, and debris was formed in the medium. on average, granules were noted in the cytoplasm after  <dig> days , while debris formation was observed in medium after about  <dig> days  after primary culture. however, in later stages, around day  <dig> in some cultures, the granular cell began to be vacuolated, rounded and finally detached from the base of the flasks.

telomere length of msc
the range of the mtrfl varied between  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  kbp in different bm samples and in different passages. mtrfl decreased from an average of  <dig>  kbp in the first passage to  <dig>  kbp in the 9th passage , giving a telomere shortening of about  <dig>  kbp within  <dig> days of expansion .

discussion
since msc can differentiate into multiple tissues in vitro and in vivo, they attract a lot of attention in cell and gene therapy. the low frequency of msc in bm <cit>  necessitates their in vitro expansion prior to clinical use. it is known that when the cells become senescent, they are unable to proliferate further. as a result, it is necessary to evaluate the proliferative capacity of expanded msc to maintain long-term tissue regeneration before re-infusion.

the key feature of senescence in dividing cells is a long period of normal growth followed by cessation of growth. so, throughout their life span, certain events must bring about senescence. our study has shown a number of changes in physiological, functional, and molecular parameters that occurred during long-term cultures. these changes included:

- typical hayflick phenomenon of cellular aging

- gradual decreasing proliferation potential

- telomere shortening

- impairment of functions

the actual age of a culture is normally recorded in population doublings . colter et al <cit>  reported that the single-cell-derived colonies of msc can be expanded up to as many as  <dig> pds in about  <dig> weeks. but we found that msc can be expanded up to  <dig> pds, similar to kassem et al <dig>  in about  <dig> days .

the curve relationship between cumulative pd and duration of culture demonstrates a relatively linear decreasing pd rate with the progression of time. furthermore, an appreciable decrease in the number of pd was seen in the latter days , suggesting that msc proliferative potential decreases faster after  <dig> days in vitro expansion. to investigate the aging of msc morphologically, we studied the culture for the presence of any abnormalities in cell morphology. production of debris in the medium and granules in the cytoplasm has been used as markers for fibroblast aging in vitro <cit> . in the present study, granulated cytoplasm and debris was observed and increased from the third month on.

we investigated another marker for cellular senescence, normally the mean telomere length. in the absence of the enzyme telomerase, telomeres gradually get shorter as cell division proceeds, and shortening of telomere throughout the life span is well-documented <cit> . the consequence maybe the inactivation of genes closest to the telomere sequences, either directly or indirectly by a position effect, perhaps involving the formation of heterochromatin. however, maintenance of telomere length has been observed in germ cells, some stem cells and malignant cells due to activation of the telomerase enzyme <cit> .

our present study shows that msc senescence is associated with telomere shortening during in vitro expansion. the rate of telomere shortening was  <dig> bp in every two passage. other studies <cit>  have shown that the telomere length of msc shortens in culture expansion. however the rate of telomere shortening in kassem et al <cit>  study was  <dig> bp/pd, which is very high in comparison to our study. this difference maybe due to the long period of their culture  in comparison to our study . they showed that mtrfl decreased from an average of  <dig>  kb in early passage cells to  <dig>  kbp in late passage cells. although loss of mtrfl in later passages is high but the mean amount of shortening was divided by the cumulative pd number. this could partly explain the difference.

in addition to the telomere length shortening, we investigated the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity of msc. msc differentiation into other lineages has been used as a marker for the multipotential nature of these cells <cit> . in our study, the differentiation potential to adipocyte and osteocyte dropped in the late-passages, similar to previous reports <cit> . our study also demonstrated that, in the later passages, a greater number of samples lose their adipocyte differentiation potential in comparison to osteocytes in the same condition. at the level of one culture plate, the percentage of cells that differentiated into adipocyte were lower than those differentiating into osteocytes.

it is generally agreed that senescent cells are irreversibly blocked in cell division, but they are still capable of many other cell functions. according to the telomere theory of cellular senescence, the shortening of chromosome ends would itself trigger a cell cycle block.

stenderup et al. <cit>  showed that donor age affects rate of in vitro senescence in msc. they define their old age group as above  <dig> years of age, and compare this with a group of donors ranging from 18– <dig> years. the difference they observe is significant. in our study, no significance in age difference was observed. this could be directly due to the donor age we had .

when there is talk of aging, transformation and tumorigenesis inevitably lingers in the background. in some cases, we observed changes from elongated adherence cells to rounded non-adherent cells after  <dig> days. today, this phenomenon is noted as a mark of transformation into cancerous cells. interestingly, recent studies highlight this issue in invitro culturing. rubiro et al. <cit>  demonstrated that adipocyte tissue derived hmsc under long term culture conditions, upon entering old age, spontaneously transform into small, clustered aggregations displaying molecular and chromosomal changes and abnormalities at a rate of 50% or so. serakinci et al. <cit>  report a similar change in long term culture. they note that transduced cells develop characteristics which correlate with the acquisition of tumorigenic phenotype  in pdl above  <dig>  they report that these cells do not undergo such alterations in lower pds. it is notable that as cells age, transformations become more common.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that msc enter senescence and start to lose their stem cell characteristics almost undetectably from the moment in vitro culture begins. msc should therefore be considered for cell and gene therapy only at the early stages of in vitro culture.
