BACKGROUND
microbial proteases are one of the most commercially valuable enzymes  <cit> , of which the largest market share has been taken by subtilases or alkaline proteases of the bacillus species, which has been extensively studied in terms of both biological properties and applications  <cit> . subtilase is the superfamily of subtilisin-like serine proteases  <cit>  in the clan sb of serine peptidases, family s <dig>  according to the merops database  <cit> . it is one of the biggest clans of serine peptidases and ubiquitously distributed in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses  <cit> . based on amino acid sequence similarity, they are classified into six families: subtilisins, thermitase, proteinase k, lantibiotic peptidase, kexin, and pyrolysin  <cit> . subtilisins are further classified into six subfamilies namely, true subtilisins, high-alkaline proteases, intracellular proteases  <cit> , phylogenetically intermediate subtilisins   <cit> , high molecular mass subtilisins   <cit> , and oxidant stable proteases   <cit> . the latter subfamily, osps, has been shown to have a wide application in the detergent and bleaching industries and has recently become one of the most attractive enzymes in various biotechnological applications.  <cit> .

despite the tremendous amount of information on microbial proteases, a search for novel proteases with unique properties is still of interest for both basic and applied aspects of these highly complex class of enzymes  <cit> . in addition to a classical method of screening for a new microorganism harbouring an interesting protease from various environments  <cit> , different molecular biology techniques, such as directed evolution  <cit> , site directed mutagenesis  <cit>  and metagenomic analysis  <cit> , have been used to engineer numerous proteases with improved or novel properties. by applying dna technology, it is essential that the gene of the protease of interest is cloned, engineered and expressed in an efficient host.

in this research, a genomic library of virgibacillus sp. sk <dig>  a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from thai fish sauce  <cit>  was constructed and screened for heterologous protease expression in escherichia coli. after an extensive screening, one open reading frame encoding a gene similar to aprx was obtained. this gene was cloned, over-expressed in e. coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography . biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme revealed that this novel protease was relatively oxidant stable and moderately halo- and thermo-tolerant. this is the first report on the biochemical characterization of the recombinant aprx-related serine protease. in addition, the evolutionary relationship of this enzyme with other aprxs from different bacteria and other enzymes in the subtilases superfamily was studied.

RESULTS
genomic dna library construction and screening
screening of a virgibacillus sp. sk <dig> genomic dna expression library in e. coli dh10b was done on lb-skim milk agar plates as described in the materials and methods section. an enumeration analysis determined the size of the genomic library to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones with 15% background , yielding  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones with inserts. when an average size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp of bacilli genomic dna was considered , this library theoretically covered the genome size of at least  <dig> and  <dig> times  when the dna fragments of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bps, respectively, were taken into account. of approximately  <dig>  clones screened , six clones showed clear halo zones, indicating the presence of proteolytic activity. the recombinant plasmids were individually extracted from these six clones and their dna inserts were analyzed. restriction digestion analysis showed that among these  <dig> clones, there were four different dna inserts based upon size: ~  <dig>  bp , ~ <dig>  bp , ~ <dig>  bp , and ~ <dig>  bp . remarkably, nucleotide sequence analysis of these clones indicated that they all shared overlapping nucleotide sequences, resulting in an open reading frame  of only one putative gene.

nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences analysis
the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the isolated orf and its flanking sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  the orf begins with the atg start codon at nucleotide position  <dig> and terminates with the tga termination codon at nucleotide position  <dig> . a sequence with good consensus to the canonical ribosomal binding-site  was found  <dig> bp upstream from the atg start codon. two putative promoters  showing moderate consensus to the σa promoter corresponding to the - <dig> and - <dig> regions were located at nucleotide positions - <dig> and - <dig> for the pl and - <dig> and - <dig> for the ps, respectively . an inverted-repeat sequence from nucleotide  <dig>  to  <dig>  is found  <dig> bp downstream of the termination codon. the orf in the nucleotide sequence encodes  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass  of  <dig>  da, and predicted pi of  <dig> . comparison of the amino acid sequence of this enzyme with other proteases in the subtilase superfamily is shown in table  <dig>  except for subtilase family d, the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited resemblance to members of the subtilase superfamily  with  <dig> to 27% identity as determined by clastalw <dig>  in addition, the coding enzyme shows a limited similarity to the aprxs from bacillus sp. sg- <dig> , b. licheniformis atcc  <dig> , and b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  with  <dig>   <dig>  and 42% identity, respectively. apr-related enzymes are alkaline serine proteases encoded from the apr gene found mostly in the class bacilli. to date, a number of apr genes have been identified such as apra , apre , aprn , aprj , aprq , aprm , aprs , and aprx   <cit> . herein, we designated our recently isolated gene from virgibacillus sp. sk <dig> as aprx-sk <dig> and the encoded enzyme as aprx-sk <dig>  the dna sequence of this novel enzyme has been submitted to genbank and its accession number is hm <dig>  multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the apr-related enzymes obtained from the swissprot database and aprx-sk <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  the similarity to other aprx enzymes starts from residue  <dig> of aprx-sk <dig> and extends nearly to the c-terminus of the protein. aspartic acid, histidine, and serine in the catalytic triad and asparagine in the oxyanion hole of subtilases are fully conserved in the aprx-sk <dig> sequence . all common secondary structure elements of enzymes belonging to the subtilases  <cit>  could be found in the catalytic core of aprx-sk <dig>  when alignment gaps of at least three amino acids are considered, among the aprx sequences, aprx-sk <dig> shows unique insertion and deletion regions. the deletions are between lys <dig> and glu <dig> , gly <dig>  and ile <dig> , while the insertion is found from pro <dig> to asn <dig>  according to aprx-sk <dig> numbering. aprx-sk <dig> lacks a canonical signal sequence for membrane translocation  at its n-terminus, indicating an intracellular location as suggested by sub-cellular prediction servers of signalp  <dig>   <cit>  and protcompb . this prediction agreed with all known aprxs, which lack n-terminal signal sequences for secretion as well.

note: percent identity and similarity were calculated by the clastalw <dig> and expressed as percentage compared to aprx-sk <dig> sequence. protein id were retrieved from the uniport databank 

phylogenetic tree analysis
the predicted amino acid sequence of aprx-sk <dig> was aligned and compared with those of well-characterized proteases in the subtilase superfamily retrieved from merops  <cit>  and the swissport  <cit>  databases. oxidant stable proteases  from various strains were also included in the alignment . the phylogenetic tree was inferred using the neighbor-joining algorithm, as shown in figure  <dig>  the sequences aligned are: subtilisin e   from bacillus subtilis 168; i- <dig> from b. clausii i- <dig>  <cit> ; bpn'  from b. amyloliquefaciens; sapb  from b. pumilus; carlsberg   from b. licheniformis; dy  from b. subtilis dy; altp  from alkaliphilus transvaalensis; ld <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain ksm-ld1; yab  from bacillus sp. strain yab; pb <dig>  from b. alkalophilus pb92; m-proteinase  from b. clausii ksm-k16; no.  <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain 221; hk  from bacillus sp. strain d6; yk  from bacillus sp. strain y; vpr  from b. subtilis; ft  from bacillus sp. strain ksm-kp43; sf  from bacillus sp. strain ksm-9865; isp- <dig>  from b. subtilis; int <dig>  from b. polymyxa 72; tsipa  from thermoactinomyces sp.; isp-q  from bacillus sp. strain nks-21; kp- <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain ksm-kp43; kp- <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain ksm-kp9860; e- <dig> from bacillus sp. strain d-6; sd- <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain sd-521; lp-ya  from bacillus sp. strain y; np- <dig>  from bacillus sp. strain nv1; oryzin   from aspergillus flavus; peptidase k  from engyodontium album; pyrolysin  pyrococcus furiosus; thermitase  from thermoactinomyces vulgaris; subtilisin ak <dig>  from geobacillus stearothermophilus; kexin  from saccharomyces cervisiae; furin  from homo sapiens; lasplantibiotic   from lactobacillus sakei; eciplantibiotic   from staphylococcus epidermidis; and aprx-sk <dig> .

the subtilase superfamily was phylogenetically grouped into six clusters: subtilisins, thermitase, proteinase k, lantibiotic peptidases, kexin, and pyrolysins , which represent subtiliase family s8a, b, c, d, e, and f, respectively,  <cit> . from our analysis, aprx-sk <dig> was not categorized into any of these families, but shared the same cluster with other aprxs, which was positioned apart from other subtilase families . notably, within the aprx cluster, aprx-sk <dig> is relatively distant from other aprxs. most osps that are produced from alkaliphilic bacilli are clustered together in the tree , i.e. e- <dig>  lp-ya, and sd- <dig> from b. cohnii dsm  <dig>  np- <dig> from b. halmapalus dsm <dig>  kp- <dig> from bacillus sp. ksm-kp <dig>  <cit> . however, some of osps such as sapb  from b. pumilus cbs  <cit> , ld <dig>  from bacillus sp. ksm-ld  <cit> , and i- <dig> from b. clausii i- <dig>  <cit> , were not located in the osps cluster, but appeared to be members of the subtilisin family.

over-expression and purification of recombinant virgibacillus aprx-sk37
to express the recombinant virgibacillus aprx-sk <dig>  the aprx-sk <dig> gene  was amplified by pcr and cloned into the xbai and xhoi restriction sites of pet21d vector such that the ribosomal binding site  and the start codon of the vector were replaced by those of the native gene. notably, the rbs of the expression vector and aprx-sk <dig> gene are identical . the recombinant plasmid, pet-aprx-sk <dig> was expressed using e. coli bl <dig> as an expression host. e. coli bl21/pet-aprx-sk <dig> was cultured as described in the materials and methods section. to optimize the induction condition, samples from various fractions including inclusion body, cytoplasm, periplasmic space, and culture supernatant taken at various time points after induction with different concentration of iptg were analyzed by sds-page and activity assay. e. coli bl <dig> carrying empty pet21d  vector was used as a control, of which no significant enzymatic activity could be detected. upon induction with  <dig>  mm iptg, the recombinant enzyme could only be found in the cytoplasmic fraction as soluble protein. no enzyme could be detected in the periplasmic extract or the culture supernatant . neither lowering the temperature nor varying the concentration of iptg dramatically affected expression level of the enzyme as determined by sds-page . routinely, ~ <dig> mg of purified recombinant aprx-sk <dig> could be obtained from 1-liter culture. the c-terminal 6xhis-tagged enzyme could be purified from cleared cell lysate by one step affinity chromatography using ni-nta resin in native condition to apparent homogeneity as shown in figure  <dig> . the purified aprx-sk <dig> showed a mm of  <dig> kda on sds-page, which corresponded well to the theoretical mass of  <dig> kda. in the native page analysis, proteolytic activity could be observed by casein-zymogram  at the corresponding position on the coomassie stained gel . zymographic assay in a denatured condition was impracticable due to enzyme sensitivity towards sds, even though an in-gel refolding step was performed .

effects of ph and temperature
the optimal ph of aprx-sk <dig> was determined based on azocaseinolytic activity. the enzyme is more active at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  when using tris-hcl buffer than tris-glycine buffer. however, aprx-sk <dig> showed a maximal activity at ph  <dig>  in the tris-glycine buffer . no activity was found at ph lower than  <dig> , indicating an alkaline protease characteristic. azocaseinolytic activity was maximum around 55°c . the enzyme appeared to be activated after pre-incubation for  <dig> h at 25-30°c prior to the assay. whereas, after  <dig> h of pre-incubation time, 50% and 0% residual activity was detected at 47°c and beyond 50°c, respectively.

effects of nacl and cacl2
proteases produced from virgibacillus sp. sk <dig> have been shown to exhibit nacl- and cacl2-activated characteristics  <cit> . therefore, the effects of nacl and cacl <dig> on the activity of aprx-sk <dig> were studied. as demonstrated in figure 5c  the activity of aprx-sk <dig> increased slightly when nacl was added, and showed maximum activity at  <dig> m. the activity decreased to 30% at  <dig> m nacl. on the contrary, subtilisin a, which was used as a control, did not show nacl-activated characteristics as indicated by a decrease in activity with increasing concentration of nacl as shown in figure 5c . both aprx-sk <dig> and subtilisin a appeared to require at least  <dig>  m of nacl to retain their original activities after incubation at 25°c for  <dig> h . when the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme was first pre-incubated with  <dig>  -  <dig> m nacl for  <dig> h at 25°c and ph  <dig> , the activity was enhanced up to 125% . these nacl-enhancing stability effects could not be observed in subtilisin a .

in addition to nacl, aprx-sk <dig> also showed a cacl2-dependent characteristic as shown in figure 5d . the enzyme was inactive in the absence of ca2+ and required  <dig> mm cacl <dig> for its maximal activity. this is opposite to the ca2+ independent charateristic of subtilisin a . the activities of both aprx-sk <dig> and subtilisin a gradually decreased when the cacl <dig> concentration was higher than  <dig> mm. the remaining activities of aprx-sk <dig> and subtilisin a, when cacl <dig> reached  <dig> mm, were  <dig> and 73%, respectively. both enzymes showed moderate stability  after pre-incubation for  <dig> h at 25°c.

effects of reducing agents and various inhibitors
the effects of various inhibitors, reducing agents and detergent on aprx-sk <dig> activity were reported in table  <dig>  a marked inhibition by  <dig> mm pmsf suggested that this enzyme is a serine protease. however, no inhibition by other serine protease inhibitors, i.e. tlck, tpck, leupeptin, and sbti could be observed. a strong inhibition by edta indicated a metal-dependent character of this enzyme. however, bestatin, a metalloprotease inhibitor selective for aminopeptidases, had no inhibitory effect. the enzyme was very sensitive to detergent , and reducing agents such as dtt and bme, whereas the inhibitor e- <dig>  which is an active-site titrant of cysteine proteases, as well as iaa and nem, did not affect enzyme activity . note that cacl <dig> was routinely added to the standard enzyme assay.

a the enzymatic activity was determined at ph  <dig>  and 55°c in the presence of  <dig> mg/ml substrate and  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  the experiment was performed in triplicate, and standard errors from the means were within 15% of the reported values.

thermal stability
previous report has suggested that mono and divalent cations contribute to the stability of the native state and increase the activation energy of unfolding of subtilisin bpn  <cit> , therefore we decided to investigate the thermostability of aprx-sk <dig> in the presence of various concentrations of ca2+ and na+ cations. at 40°c, the enzyme activity could be activated by calcium. in the standard reaction condition  the enzyme was activated after incubation for  <dig> min and the optimal activity was retained for up to  <dig> h . when the concentration of cacl <dig> was increased to  <dig> mm , the highest enzyme activation could be observed from  <dig> - <dig> h. when the enzyme was incubated longer than  <dig> h in both  <dig> and  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  the activity declined. moreover, when  <dig> m nacl was added in the presence of either  <dig> mm  or  <dig> mm  cacl <dig>  the stability of the enzyme was increased up to  <dig> h. . the same phenomenon but at a higher rate of thermal inactivation was observed at 55°c . the enzyme activity in the presence of only cacl <dig>  decreased rapidly after the first  <dig> h of incubation and became almost completely inactivated after  <dig> h . in contrast, addition of  <dig> m nacl could significantly lower the rate of thermal inactivation as compared to those without nacl. the residual activity of the reaction containing  <dig> m nacl +  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm cacl <dig> at  <dig> h was approximately 45% and 60%, of their original activity, respectively . these observations suggested that nacl played an important role in exerting enzyme thermal stability while cacl <dig> was only responsible for activating enzyme activity.

effect of oxidizing agent
stability against oxidizing agents is one of the most attractive properties of bacterial proteases. therefore, we used h2o <dig> as the representative oxidizing agent to test aprx-sk <dig> oxidant stability. as shown in figure  <dig>  the enzyme was fully active in the presence of as much as 5% h2o <dig>  however, the enzyme activity gradually decreased when it was pre-incubated for  <dig> min with increasing concentration of h2o <dig>  no activity was found in a reaction pre-incubated with 10% h2o <dig> 

discussion
this research reports the cloning, expression, biochemical characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of a novel intracellular bacterial aprx serine protease. a previous report  <cit>  of this enzyme from b. subtilis, focusing on bioinformatic analysis and regulation of gene expression, indicated that this enzyme is an intracellular serine protease, which is expressed in the stationary phase and not essential for either growth or sporulation. the aprx-sk <dig> enzyme in this study was derived from a moderately halophilic bacterium, virgibacillus sp. sk <dig>  which was isolated from thai fish sauce that was saturated with 26-28% of nacl. this bacterium produced numerous nacl-activated subtilisin-like proteinases, three of them having been partially purified and characterized as extracellular halotolerant bacillopeptidase f-like proteinases  <cit> . their activities did not depend on calcium, showed maximum activity at ph  <dig>  55-60°c, 25-30% nacl and 70- <dig> mmol l- <dig> cacl <dig>  and stability at 0-30% nacl and < <dig> mmol l- <dig> cacl <dig>  <cit> . the nacl-activated property of aprx-sk <dig> was not unexpected as it has been shown that the cell membrane of halophilic bacteria is incapable to completely prevent an increased flux of sodium into the cells  <cit> . intracellular na+ concentrations of moderately halophilic bacteria growing in media containing 2- <dig> m nacl were found between  <dig>  to  <dig>  m with an average of  <dig>  m  <cit> . our enzyme can be activated and stabilized by  <dig> m nacl  and tolerate up to  <dig> m nacl . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a halotolerant intracellular serine protease.

dna sequence analysis of aprx-sk <dig> indicated that the gene is regulated by two putative σa promoters , which have been suggested to function as primary and secondary promoters of b. subtilis aprx, respectively  <cit> . the open reading frame  of virgibacillus aprx-sk <dig> is slightly smaller than that of b. subtilis aprx and lacks the alternative start condon ttg, at position 76- <dig>  met/leu <dig> in aprx numbering of b. subtilis. the predicted mm and pi of aprx-sk <dig> are in the same range as those of aprxs from bacillus species . the key difference between aprx-sk <dig>  other aprxs, and some other intracellular proteases is its n-terminal domain, which showed no similarity to those of known proteins in the database. it has been suggested that the n-terminal domain of subtilases acts as an intramolecular chaperone or pro-peptide that mediates enzyme folding; nevertheless, the role of this domain on aprx-sk <dig> activity is unclear. the localization of aprx from b. subtilis in cytoplasm has been previously reported  <cit> . the recombinant aprx-sk <dig> in this study is found in cytoplasm; however, the precise localization of the wild-type enzyme is unknown. the enzyme appeared to be active without cleavage of any pro-peptide. its putative function as a chaperone for correct enzyme folding or as a regulatory domain remains to be explored.

the benefit of isolating a novel enzyme from a dna expression library instead of pcr-cloning using degenerated primers is that the gene encoding active enzyme can be readily obtained. this advantage is very important especially for bacillus subtilases, which often form inactive, insoluble aggregates when produced in e. coli expression systems  <cit> . the recombinant aprx-sk <dig> appeared to be located as active soluble protein in the cytosolic compartment; none were found as inactive, insoluble inclusion bodies or secreted into the periplasm or culture media. the fact that the enzyme was first identified from e. coli colonies that showed halo zone during genomic dna library screening could be the result of membrane leakage after prolonged growth for more than  <dig> h. remarkably, despite a thorough screening of the library that covered approx.  <dig> depth of the library, no other protease genes could be isolated. this could be because other enzymes formed inactive aggregates, are unstable in e. coli, or the enzyme activity may require higher sodium or calcium, which was not included in the screening condition. moreover, it could be because the active enzymes might need specific post-translational modification, which was lacking in the e. coli expression system and that the substrate in our screening  was not an appropriate substrate for certain enzymes. further modification of screening conditions may lead to the identification of additional active enzymes. pet vector was used to express the recombinant aprx-sk <dig> gene in this study. this system has been shown to be efficient for the expression of various bacillus hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> . the canonical ribosomal binding site in this vector is identical to that of virgibacillus aprx-sk <dig>  the high level of expression could be because of synonymous codon usage, which leads to a fast translation rate in the e. coli expression system  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis revealed that aprx-sk <dig> belongs to the superfamily of subtilases or subtilisin-like proteases. this result is consistent with the family analysis of b. subtilis aprx  <cit> . moreover, our analysis indicated that the aprxs are clustered in a distinct group, of which aprx-sk <dig> is relatively different from. this could be because aprx-sk <dig> possesses unique characteristics of oxidant stability and moderate salt-activation, which are not found in other aprxs. however, according to our phylogenetic tree, aprx-sk <dig> was not categorized into the osps group. notably, phylogenetic analysis of osps reports little evolutionary relationship among this group of enzymes. our phylogenetic analysis indicated that most osps do not belong to any of the subtilisin families previously described in bacteria or fungi, but appear to belong to a different cluster . this finding is similar to the phylogenetic analysis of a subtilisin-like protease gene family in the grass endophytic fungus epichloë festucae  <cit> . hence, osps should not be classified as the subfamily of subtilisins as previously suggested  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of various osps producers suggested that the sources of osps encompass bacilli from diverse taxon, which could be the result of different mechanisms of oxidant stabilization. taken together the result of phylogenetic analysis as discussed above, we would like to propose a new family of subtilases superfamily, namely alkaline serine protease x  or subitlase s8g, according to the merops database derived from subtilases classification by siezen and leunissen  <cit> . in addition, we believe that the classification of osps has to be re-defined.

biochemical characterization revealed that recombinant aprx-sk <dig> is a ca2+- dependent alkaline serine protease and moderate thermophile with optimal ph and temperature at  <dig>  and 55°c, respectively. the enzyme requires calcium to function with maximum activity at  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  a calcium-dependent characteristic is well known for members of the subtilases superfamily, of which conserved calcium binding sites are essential for enzyme stability and/or activity  <cit> . in nature, calcium may play a physiological role in aprx-sk <dig> gene regulation as it has been shown that a massive accumulation of calcium during sporulation is found in most bacilli in order to respond to adverse environmental changes  <cit> . in b. subtilis, aprx is expressed in the late stationary phase under the control of various transition state regulatory genes  <cit> . the high sensitivity of aprx-sk <dig> to a reducing agent suggested that disulfide bonds are essential for structural stability. the primary amino acid sequence revealed that aprx-sk <dig> contains  <dig> cysteines . this richness in cys is unique for enzymes in the aprx family since cys is usually absent from subtilases in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> .

in general, subtilases are inactivated by hydrogen peroxide due to the oxidation of methionine , located next to the catalytic serine , thus preventing the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate during the transition state of their hydrolytic reaction  <cit> . aprx-sk <dig> possesses met <dig> next to catalytic ser <dig>  similar to other subtiliases  and other osps  <cit> . the actual mechanism of oxidant stability is still unclear. in the study of kp- <dig>  an osp enzyme, oxidation of met was not a fatal modification, but rather altered its substrate specificity  <cit> . kp-43's crystal structure suggested that the rate of met-oxidation in kp- <dig> was lower than those of other subtilases, probably due to the longer distance between the met residue in the catalytic vicinity and the oxyanion hole  <cit> . hence, the oxidant-stable ability is strongly dependent on enzyme conformation and structural integrity, which is intrinsic to each enzyme. the oxidant stability as well as halotolerant and moderately thermophilic properties of aprx-sk <dig> should make this novel enzyme attractive for biotechnological applications in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel oxidant stable, halotolerant and moderately thermophilic alkaline serine protease, named aprx-sk <dig>  has been identified and characterized. its unique property is attractive for various biotechnological applications.
