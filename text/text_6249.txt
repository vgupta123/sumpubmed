BACKGROUND
prion diseases are characterised by a neurodegenerative pattern represented by neuronal loss, vacuolation of neurons and neuropil, and astrocytosis. they are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal protein, named prpsc, which is formed postranslationally from the normal isoform . to date, the agent causing tses is still incompletely characterized, although prpsc is believed to be its major if not unique constituent  <cit>  which when present as it has recent as small prpsc aggregates are the most efficient initiators of tse disease  <cit> .

a classical inflammatory response associated to the infection is lacking, as evidenced by the absence of proinflammatory cytokine upregulation  <cit> , of a polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells around cerebral vessels or any humoral or cellular immune response to infection  <cit> . nevertheless, there is a large body of evidence that immune system is involved somehow in the pathogenesis of the disease  <cit> . indeed, strong circumstantial evidence of the involvement of immune system is provided by the fact that a significant number of genes associated with the immune response have shown increased expression in scrapie-infected mouse brains  <cit> , that mice have shown reduced susceptibility to scrapie after steroid administration  <cit>  and splenectomized mice have shown prolongation of incubation time to scrapie  <cit> . in analogy, in other experiments it has been reported that susceptibility to scrapie was enhanced by aspecific stimulators, such as phytohemagglutinin   <cit> .

in mouse models, follicular dendritic cells  are involved in scrapie replication and neuroinvasion following peripheral inoculation of scrapie agents is strongly impaired in animals lacking these cells  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown that also dendritic cells acquire prpsc in vitro, and transport directly into lymphoid tissues in vivo, suggesting that dendritic cells can serve as a cellular bridge between the gut lumen and the lymphoid compartment  <cit> . from that scenario it can be envisaged a "trojan-horse" effect of these cells of the immune system even if little is still known about their activity in scrapie. it has been suggested that at least one mechanism by which immune system is tightly involved in prion infection is through the primary uptake of prion protein, probably representing a narrow bridge between the portal of entry of the prion protein and the peripheral and the central nervous system  <cit> . nevertheless, it was also observed that skin-derived langherans-like cells have been shown to be able to degrade prpsc in vitro  <cit>  and this findings contribute to the hypothesis that monocytic cells can also have a protective effect against prions. all together, these results clearly indicate that the relationship between cells and prions is far to be completely elucidated and possible dynamic relationships can determinate different outcomes. the interplay between scrapie agents and the immune cells is even less understood in central nervous system. microglia, which are the immunocompetent cells that can be considered the equivalent of dendritic cells  <cit> , seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease  <cit>  but their effective role is still under debate. there is a large body of evidence, however, which suggests that glial cells, through their secreted proinflammatory cytokines contribute to prion-related neurodegenerative processes  <cit> . overall the gene array data demonstrate the presence of a strong inflammatory reaction and stress response in the late phase of the disease  <cit> .

in the present study, we evaluate if the onset of the disease can be modified by exogenous treatment with cytokines known to act synergistically in promoting a proinflammatory response  <cit> , in order to better clarify the role of immune cells in scrapie in the central nervous system of mice.

RESULTS
effect of intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> on central nervous system
mice were treated with cytokines or sterile saline, according to protocols, and after  <dig> or  <dig> hours tnf-α and ifn-γ production, along with prpc expression, were monitored in brain homogenates. in parallel an immunohistochemical analysis of gfap and f4/ <dig> expression was performed on paraffin embedded brain tissue.

ifn-γ and tnf-α were produced in mice stimulated both with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  even if with slight different patterns. mice inoculated with sterile saline produced a moderate amount of ifn-γ and tnf-α but differences with untreated mice were difficult to address due to the high variability of the measured values. mice injected with il- <dig> alone did not showed a significant increase of ifn-γ, and only a slight increase of tnf-α . mice injected with il- <dig>  showed a significant increase of ifn-γ with at a lesser extent also an increase of tnf-α . mice inoculated with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  finally showed a strong increase in the production of both ifn-γ and tnf-α, with a more prominent effect after  <dig> hours of exposure .

the expression of prpc was assessed by western blot analysis in individual mice  <dig> and  <dig> hours after treatment and compared with that of untreated mice. the administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> did not induce any change in the expression of prpc, neither at  <dig> or  <dig> hours after their intracerebral administration .

immunohystochemistry was performed in basal nuclei, thalamus, cerebellum and brain stem of mice enrolled in the experiment. immunostaining for gfap and f4/ <dig> was used as indirect assessment of activation of astrocytes and microglia, respectively.

gfap positive astrocytes were present in the normal, untreated brains and their number increased after treatment with sterile saline. this increase was mainly evident in the brain stem. the pattern of gfap expression did not change after treatments with il- <dig> and il- <dig> when compared to saline .

f4/ <dig> positivity was barely detectable in brain parenchyma of normal, untreated mice. reactive monocytes located near brain vessels were also present and were considered perivascular macrophages. in mice treated with saline there was a very slight increase in the number of activated microglia, almost constant in all brain sections. mice treated with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  showed a marked increase in f4/ <dig> microglia and perivascular macrophages expression throughout the brain areas observed . our findings indicate that il- <dig> and il- <dig> were able to exert a substantial activation of microglia  <dig> and  <dig> hours after their intracerebral administration.

effect of intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> on the course of scrapie infection
to assess if an early activation of microglia, contemporary to intracerebral scrapie inoculation, is able to modify the course of scrapie infection, two groups of  <dig> mice were infected with scrapie and treated with il- <dig> and il- <dig> or sterile saline, respectively, according to protocols. after  <dig> days  <dig> animals from each group were sacrificed to indirectly assess the progression of the infection by determining prpsc brain accumulation. the remaining mice were monitored to assess the mortality rate . all inoculated mice developed unequivocal clinical signs of scrapie, starting after  <dig> days post-inoculation. there was a general tendency of mice in the il- <dig> and il- <dig> treated group to develop clinical symptoms earlier than untreated mice. il- <dig> and il- <dig> treated mice started to dye at day  <dig> post-inoculation, while untreated mice started at day  <dig> post-inoculation. throughout the observation period, there was a clear tendency of il- <dig> and il- <dig> treated mice to die before the untreated mice. mean survival times  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for il- <dig> and il- <dig> treated mice and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for untreated mice. survival curve analysis indicated a statistically significant difference between the two groups .

at  <dig> days post-inoculation prpsc accumulation was quite variable among individual mice ; mice inoculated with il- <dig> and il- <dig>  however, showed a more pronounced accumulation of prpsc in brain tissue than untreated mice, with a statistical analysis that closely approached the significance . to further corroborate this finding and due to the variability observed, we pooled the brain homogenates of mice sacrificed at  <dig> d.p.i. and compared prpsc in the pooled homogenates of the two groups. the pooled homogenates from the il-12/il- <dig> treated mice showed a more than doubled prpsc content compared with that of untreated mice .

the prpsc brain accumulation was very invariable in terminally sick mice and similar pattern and quantity of prpsc deposition were observed in il- <dig> and il- <dig> treated and untreated mice .

the results obtained using a single dose of scrapie inoculum were then re-evaluated using the same dose of cytokines and different doses of scrapie inocula . this experiment confirmed that the exogenous treatment of il- <dig> and il- <dig> induced a reduction of survival time in mice inoculated with 10- <dig>  10- <dig> and 10- <dig> me <dig> dilutions.

discussion
il- <dig> is a heterodimeric interleukin produced by antigen presenting cells as macrophages, dendritic cells or microglia. it plays a central role in cell-mediated immune response. recent findings show that il- <dig> actively plays an important role also in central nervous system but its influence seems to be a double-edged sword having both a detrimental effect observed in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and a protective role against neurotropic viruses  <cit> . il- <dig> acts in a paracrine fashion in the cascade of events that lead to a th1-like immune response but it has been seen that it may play also an autocrine effect on microglia  <cit> .

il- <dig> is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by antigen presenting cells. it is a newly-described cytokine that has been shown to be essential for ifn-γ production  <cit> . there is no direct evidence of autocrine effect of il- <dig> on central nervous system. however, the finding that mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro with recombinant murine il- <dig> induced tnf-α, il-1α and il-1β  <cit> , suggests that il- <dig> can exert also an autocrine effect on microglia which represent the main population of macrophage-like cells in the brain. this fact is further corroborated by the results of recent studies showing that il-18-gene-disrupted mice had impaired microglial activities  <cit> . due to the well-known synergistic effect of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , we firstly tested the effect of the direct intracerebral administration of these two cytokines.

we found that intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> induces a production of tnf-α and ifn-γ in brain tissue, at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after administration. in addition, we found that il- <dig> and il- <dig> induced also the stimulation of macrophage-like cells.

these findings do not clarify the complete scenario of events following inoculation but support the concept that il- <dig> and il- <dig> are able to induce a broad spectrum of effects, comprising the activation of microglia as showed by the increased cytokine production and especially by increased immunoreactivity to f4/ <dig> in brain tissues. it is unclear if the cellular activation is due to direct effect of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  mimicking an autocrine pattern or it is the effect of activated t lymphocytes that, in turn, produce ifn-γ and hence stimulate microglia through a classic paracrine pattern.

we further investigated the effect of combined il- <dig> and il- <dig> on scrapie pathogenesis. we found that a single intracerebral cytokine administration, contemporary to the scrapie inoculum, is able to affect the course of scrapie pathogenesis. in mice inoculated with high prion dose , the treatment with il-12/il- <dig> induced a small but statistically significant reduction of mean survival time. this effect was paralleled by an increased brain accumulation of prpsc at  <dig> days post inoculation, but not at the terminal stage of the disease. our findings complement those obtained by thackray et al.  <cit> , who found that il- <dig> knock-out mice show a marked reduction of incubation period intracerebral or peripheral scrapie infection. il- <dig> and il- <dig> on one side and il- <dig> on the other, in fact, can be considered counteracting molecules in the macrophage-like cells.

in our study we did not observe any effect on prpc expression after intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  we assessed prpc expression by measuring its content in brain homogenates, a method that mostly account for neuronal expression of prpc, but can be not adequate for measuring subtle variations in other cell types of the brain. in scrapie, incubation time can be markedly reduced in transgenic mice overexpressing prpc  <cit>  and prion protein expression has been reported to be cytokine-inducible in some human neural cell lines  <cit> . the prion protein is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system and this mainly depends on high expression in neurons  <cit> , but prpc is also expressed in microglia and astrocytes  <cit> . taken together these considerations let us to conclude that the reduction of the incubation period we observed in mice treated with il- <dig> and il- <dig> is not explainable by modification of prpc expression in neurons; however we can not exclude that il- <dig> and il-18-activated microglia overexpress prpc, as it is true for ifn-γ-activated human cd14+ monocytes  <cit> . on the basis of the effect observed after intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  we can suppose that il- <dig> and il-18-activated microglia favor the progression of the disease when high prion doses were used. in this scenario it is possible to postulate two different mechanisms that can explain our findings. the first is that activated microglia have an increased capability to uptake scrapie agents and to present them to neurons, implying that microglia act as bridge to reach neurons. there is evidence, in fact, that besides lympho-reticular cells  <cit>  also mononuclear phagocytic cells  <cit>  support replication of prions and may mediate transmission of infection from periphery to central nervous system. in addition, more recent findings indicate that a localized early inflammatory response takes place within the central nervous system of mice intracerebrally inoculated with brain homogenates from normal or scrapie infected mice  <cit> . it suggests that inflammatory cells, such as microglia, can act in the early response to prion invasion after intracerebral scrapie inoculation. finally, it has been found that purified microglia from creutzfeldt-jakob disease-infected mice show infectivity comparable to that of starting brain homogenate even if express less prp  <cit> . the second mechanism is that il- <dig> and il- <dig> administration increases the ability of microglia to damage central nervous system, which led to a more precocious neuronal dead. this hypothesis is based on the finding that widespread neuronal degeneration is likely to induce microglial activation which, in turn, may further contribute to neurotoxicity  <cit>  by releasing inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α that contribute to the development of pathological findings  <cit> . it is worth noting that the reduction of the incubation period observed was obtained with a single interleukin administration at the time of scrapie inoculation. it is difficult to postulate that such a treatment would exert its effects in the late phase of the disease, i.e.  <dig> to  <dig> months later. it is our opinion, therefore, that these findings give credit to the hypothesis that il- <dig> and il-18-activated microglia are more efficient to uptake and to present scrapie agents to neurons.

incubation time of scrapie is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the inoculum as reported by us and others  <cit> . this pattern would be consistent with a process of exponential growth of the scrapie agent that cause disease onset at a threshold level. our results are reminiscent of such a process because we observed a more pronounced accumulation of prpsc at  <dig> days post-inoculation and a decreased incubation time in il- <dig> and il-18-treated mice compared to the control animals. on the other hand, all mice with terminal disease showed very similar levels of prpsc brain accumulation irrespective of treatment, implying that cytokines administration did not interfere in the interplay among scrapie agent replication, prpsc accumulation and neuronal degeneration in the late phase of the disease. these findings strongly indicate that il- <dig> and il- <dig> inoculated mice developed the disease before control mice because of a faster kinetic of prpsc accumulation and a more rapid progression of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided evidence that intracerebral administration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> stimulated microglia in central nervous system and that a single treatment contemporary to intracerebral scrapie injection is able to affect the course of scrapie infection. our findings provide insight into the process involved in the central nervous system pathogenesis of scrapie and contribute to shed renewed light on the interplay between immune system and scrapie agents.
