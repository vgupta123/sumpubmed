BACKGROUND
with the exception of the transient wave of global demethylation that occurs during embryonic development, dna methylation is considered, relative to covalent histone modifications, to be a more permanent, heritable mark. dna methylation of cytosine at position c <dig> in cpg dinucleotides is reported to influence specific gene expression, especially to suppress gene expression  <cit> . cpg dinucleotides are largely depleted from the genome except for in regions referred to as cpg islands, found in the proximal promoter regions of many genes  <cit> . most of these cpg clusters are unmethylated during normal cell development, except for tissue-specific differentially methylated genes  <cit> , imprinted genes  <cit>  and some x-chromosome inactivation related genes  <cit> . modern genetic studies have established that dna methylation is required not only for embryonic development  <cit> , but also plays a critical role in diseased status such as cancer  <cit> . as the field of epigenomics expands to study multiple diverse normal and pathological processes, it becomes increasingly important to understand the role that normal global genome-wide dna methylation patterns play in influencing global gene expression.

a differentiated cell in an organism is thought to contain essentially the same dna as its ancestors, but it differs in the quality and quantity of gene expressions, and therefore functions differently. dna-binding transcription factors are crucial determinants of gene expression, and many groups have shown that that epigenetic mechanisms such as nucleosome positioning and covalent chromatin modifications and are involved in regulating transcription factor accessibility and gene expression during cellular differentiation  <cit> .

understanding of dna methylation in regulating normal tissue-specific genome function is still limited, although the causal relationship between dna methylation and gene regulation has been well studied  <cit> . more than  <dig> tissue-specific differentially methylated regions  have been identified via a restriction landmark genomic scanning  assay and expression of genes associated with these regions have been shown to be correlated with dna methylation  <cit> . other studies have linked dna methylation to tissue-specific gene expression by studying the promoter regions of a small number of imprinted genes and those involved in maintenance of pluripotency  <cit> . both sexes use genomic imprinting to control the expression of approximately  <dig> imprinted genes and allowing monoallelic expression from either the maternal or paternal allele, and most imprinted genes regulate placental and fetal growth  <cit> . however, studies on small subsets of tissue specific genes in mice could not prove an association between dna methylation and gene expression  <cit> . the inconsistent result may result from a limited number of genes being studied and differences in the cpg island content of their proximal promoter regions.

the advent of global dna methylation arrays and next-generation rna sequencing transcriptome studies have made it possible to explore the global relationship between gene methylation and expression during cell development and tissue differentiation. researchers using a comparative genomic approach to study the dna methylation patterns among species have successfully identified a role of dna methylation in the evolution of gene regulation across the tissues and species  <cit> . the fast development of next generation sequencing technology provides a comprehensive and reliable approach, rna-seq, to fast quantify the global transcription levels of a tissue  <cit> . rna-seq allows researchers to count the amount of mrna being sequenced, and consequently, it more accurately measures the transcriptional levels than the fluorescent intensity-based methods, such as mrna microarray and qpcr. in addition, rna-seq provides single nucleotide resolution for mrna, therefore, it can differentiate gene isoforms , whereas microarray is often not able to identify isoforms because it uses probes to detect mrna levels. methylation array and rna-seq techniques are powerful tools to study global methylation variation and transcription changes, but no joint analysis with these two type data have been reported yet. in this study, we use an integrative analysis of both data sets across three different normal human tissues with the intention of shedding light on understanding the underlying mechanism of dna methylation mediating normal tissue differentiation.

RESULTS
the dna promoter methylation data for human heart, kidney and liver tissue samples was obtained from the ncbi geo database with the accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  this data was generated by pai et al. who studied the methylation patterns between human and chimpanzee tissues  <cit> . six individual samples were collected for each tissue type. the methylation profiles were generated by illumina humanmethylation <dig> dna analysis beadchip that contains  <dig>  cpg loci located in either cpg islands or non-cpg islands of promoter regions.

the dna methylation profiles of human heart, kidney, and liver were integrated with rna-seq data for analysis. the rna-seq data were obtained from human bodymap  <dig>  project by illumina, inc. human bodymap  <dig>  project conducted deep sequencing for total rna of  <dig> individual human tissues with one sample for each tissue type. the rna-seq data was available in ncbi geo database with accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  in this study, we combined rna-seq data for heart, kidney and liver tissues with dna methylation data.

data quantification and quality
the variability in gene methylation level has various sources, including tissue differentiation, individual sample variation, and technical variance. for the same tissue, genes are expected to carry similar epigenetic modification to control tissue differentiation, thus the variability between sample replicates is expected to be marginal comparing with the variability between different tissues. to evaluate the quality of the dna methylation data, we plotted the methylation levels between each pair of samples from the same tissue. all plots consistently showed low variability. figure 1a-c show  <dig> plots for random pair of samples from heart, kidney and liver. the amount of genes that have a standard deviation less than  <dig>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for heart, kidney and liver, respectively. when we plot the average methylation level for each cpg marker between tissues, the variation was substantial larger . it is clear that points in 1e and 1f are more widespread than that in 1d, implying difference between heart and kidney is smaller than that between heart and liver or between kidney and liver. heart and kidney both develop from mesoderm and liver develops from endoderm, therefore, not only do epigenetic changes correctly differentiate between differentiated cell types, but they also reveal the distinct embryonic origins of tissues.

the rna-seq data from illumina bodymap  <dig>  project was generated by illumina hiseq  <dig> with  <dig> bp paired end sequencing. for each sample, ~ <dig> million reads were generated. we used tophat  <cit>  to map short reads onto the reference sequence of human genome  <dig> . about 55% paired reads were aligned with the reference genome. software cufflinks  <cit>  was then used to quantify the expression levels of transcripts. we counted from  <dig>  to  <dig>  transcripts from  <dig> tissues and compared the transcriptional levels between each pair of tissues. figure 1g-i plot the pairwise expression levels between two tissues. the transcriptional levels are represented at logarithm scale for fpkm values calculated from cufflinks. at log scale, the expression levels are aligned well between tissues with the majority of plots located in the lower level. to further explore the expression patterns, we drew quantile-quantile plots to compare the expression distributions between tissues . all data distributions are aligned well in the high expression levels. however, at the lower end, there are dramatic differences between tissues. heart has a number of genes with significantly lower expression than both kidney and liver, and liver has more low-expression genes than kidney.

dna methylation signature identifies tissue specificity
first, we performed hierarchical clustering using all  <dig>  cpg markers. we tested different dissimilarity measures, including euclidean distance, pearson's dissimilarity and spearman's dissimilarity. pearson's and spearman's dissimilarity are both based on data correlation, thus, they have similar performance that is better than euclidean distance. for illumina humanmethylation <dig> data, most of genes have two or more cpg markers and the markers from the same genes should be correlated. thus, correlation based dissimilarity method is more appropriate for this analysis. ward linkage method was used in hierarchical clustering. the resulting dendrogram was shown in figure 2a. the  <dig> methylation samples were clustered into  <dig> major groups, each representing a human tissue. again, in terms of dna methylation, heart and kidney are closer to each other than they are from liver. there was only one misplacement in this clustering, in that one kidney sample was clustered into heart group though it also has short distance to other kidney samples. overall, tissue samples were successfully clustered based on their dna methylation patterns.

secondly, we looked for approaches to improve the hierarchical clustering result. the misplacement occurred in hierarchical clustering is likely due to the large number of markers. the markers with low variation should not contribute to tissue classification, but their variances may present as a noise to affect clustering. therefore, we intended to filter out the markers with low variance prior to clustering. we selected only the cpg markers that have a standard deviation greater than  <dig>  and we obtained  <dig> markers. a heatmap is shown in figure 2b. hierarchical clustering correctly classified all  <dig> samples with their tissue labels. in figure 2b, green is for low methylation levels and red is for high levels. most markers showed distinct methylation levels among the three tissues, therefore, they can be used as dna signatures to represent different tissue. note that the methylation levels of the first  <dig> markers in the heatmap are not aligned with tissue labels. we found that  <dig> markers are located in x chromosome, and they are methylation markers for sex imprinted genes. their high levels  indicate female, and low levels  indicate male.

thirdly, to further investigate methylation clustering, we used an alternative method, principal components analysis . one of the advantages of pca is that it disassociates the correlation between markers when methylation data are transformed into principal components. we plotted the  <dig> samples in the first three principal components, and the samples are grouped into their tissue labels with the second and third principal components . the circle points in black color are for liver samples, the red squares are kidney and the green triangles are heart. all points are grouped well except one kidney sample that is close to heart samples as in figure 1a. however, from the dimension of principal component  <dig>  this kidney sample is still in the range of other kidney samples rather than heart samples.

significantly expressed genes are affected by dna methylation
next, we wanted to determine to what degree the gene expression differences among tissues are affected by epigenetic changes. we used cuffdiff to find expression variation  between tissues and then associated the selected genes with their methylation levels in humanmethylation <dig> array. in total, we selected  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between any pair of the three tissues and that exist in humanmethylatin <dig> array. we further looked at whether these  <dig> genes showed dna methylation variation between tissues as well. unpaired t test was used to detect the methylation differences among tissues and the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  from the  <dig> significantly expressed genes, only about one third of them  were not shown to have significant changes in methylation between the three tissues. in total,  <dig> genes were shown to have significant methylation difference between heart and liver,  <dig> genes were significant between kidney and liver, and  <dig> genes were significant between heart and kidney. among them, many genes overlap to be significant in two or three tests. for example,  <dig> genes showed significant results in comparing both kidney and heart against liver, and  <dig> genes were significant in all three tests, heart vs. kidney, heart vs. liver, and kidney vs. liver. the list of these  <dig> genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  the distance of each cpg markers to the transcriptional start site  was used a covariate to fit into a linear model, but it was not identified as a confounding factor to influence gene expression. in short, the majority of differentially expressed genes showed significant changes in dna methylation, implying dna methylation plays an important role in mediating tissue differentiation.

we closely examined the  <dig> genes that not only have significantly different level of mrna expression, but also have remarkably different dna methylation between any pair of the three tissues. we first studied those genes that express very low in kidney, heart and liver . their marginal expression may regulate important cellular and biochemical functions, but this requires further elucidation, and and their expression should be more finely tuned. for instance, iodotyrosine deiodinase  was expressed at low levels in all three tissues , which was in accordance to its high methylation level . its expression in heart and kidney is negligible, but it has low expression in liver. this is consistent with the lower level of dna methylation in liver. iodotyrosine deiodinase, also known as iodotyrosine dehalogenase  <dig> especially expressed in the thyroid, and salvages iodide by catalyzing deiodination of mono- and diiodotyrosine during the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormone thyroxine  <cit> . the function of iyd in liver remains unknown. next, we examined other genes that have distinct high expressions in heart, kidney and liver , which includes  <dig> genes. this pool of genes may be critical to the development and/or function of kidney, heart and liver. several genes were selected for further consideration. transcobalamin i  is a vitamin b <dig> binding protein that regulates the absorption, trafficking and secretion. tcn <dig> abnormality in the liver and kidney has been thought to associate with impairment of these tissues  <cit> . its fpkm values were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in heart, kidney and liver respectively, corresponding to beta values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . thus, its low expression in heart may be partially regulated by dna methylation. for another example, serine protease  <dig> , belongs to the peptidase s <dig> family  <cit> , and is highly expressed in kidney, heart and liver , and this is consistent with a negative regulatory role for dna methylation in controlling gene expression as all three tissues show relatively low levels of dna methylation .

we next investigated whether dna methylation is associated with induced or repressed gene expression during tissue differentiation. we selected the genes from the  <dig> genes that had sufficient changes in methylation levels between tissues  and plotted the changes in methylation and expression levels in figure  <dig>  the fold change in expression levels was plotted on a logarithmic scale. although higher methylation levels are associated with both lower and higher expression levels, figure  <dig> shows a trend that high methylation is more likely to repress gene expression. for example in figure 4b of kidney vs. heart,  <dig> genes show higher methylation levels in kidney. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> show lower expression levels, and only  <dig> show higher expression levels in kidney than in heart. therefore, the effect of dna methylation on gene expression may be bi-directional, nonetheless, higher methylation tends to repress gene expression.

dna methylation change correlates with gene expression
we further investigated whether the significant changes in methylation will result in a measurable difference in gene expression. to select the genes with significant variation in methylation among the three tissues, we performed analysis of variance  for each gene. to adjust p values for multiple tests, we control false discovery rate  at 5% and obtained  <dig> cpg markers that showed significant variation among the three tissues. we then conducted regression analysis for gene methylation levels and transcriptional levels. similarly, we adjusted p values by controlling fdr at 5%. amazingly, most of the  <dig> cpg dinucleotides  showed significant correlation between methylation and expression. the p value distribution of regression analysis is shown in figure 5a. it is clear from this figure that the amount of significant correlations is not generated from random sampling. thus, we conclude that dna methylation extensively correlates with gene expression during tissue differentiation.

from the  <dig> cpg dinucleotides,  <dig> were associated with repressed gene expression, which was only slightly larger than the number of genes  whose methylation levels were positively correlated gene expression. this result further confirms our finding that the effects of methylation on gene expression are bi-directional during tissue differentiation. as humanmethylation <dig> markers are located either within or outside cpg island, we are interested to know if the location of markers affects its regulation on expression. figure 5b-c show the distributions of pearson's correlations for markers that are located within cpg island  or outside of known cpg islands . the two distributions are similar with both peaks in positive and negative correlation regions. the peak in negative correlation region is slightly higher than that in positive region, but it is not significant. it indicates a weak trend of increased methylation being associated with decreased gene expression.

we identified several tissue specific genes by sorting these genes whose methylation levels significantly correlates with gene expression. we identified c4bpa, expression of  <dig>  in kidney,  <dig>  in heart and  <dig>  in liver, associated with dna methylation of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. c4bpa encodes complement component  <dig> binding protein, which is known to be only produced in liver  <cit> . other selected genes involving in complement system include c5ar <dig>  cd <dig>  fgg, and krt <dig>  aquaporin  <dig>  was expressed high in the kidney  with corresponding dna methylation of  <dig>  in kidney,  <dig>  in heart and  <dig>  in liver. we noticed that the values of dna methylation are relatively high in all three tissues, while the value difference between kidney and heart is  <dig>  and that between kidney and liver is as high as  <dig> . aqp <dig>  found in the apical cell membrane and intracellular vesicles of the kidney's collecting duct principle cells, is an important vasopressin-regulated water channel, which supports out finding of high correlation between mrna expression and dna methylation  <cit> . these results showed that integrative analysis of genome wide dna methylation and rna-seq transcriptome data can reveal global regulation of gene expression by dna methylation.

discussion
extensive chromatin remodelling occurs on a global level during development. as embryonic stem  cells differentiate, they lose pluripotency  <cit> . just as normal stem/progenitor cells are significantly remodelling chromatin during differentiation, it is also important to note that these cells also use dna methylation, to collaborate with chromatin configuration, to stabilize key gene expression patterns which emerge during normal development and adult tissue cell turnover. for example, localized dna methylation changes occur at key cytokine target genes during embryonic and adult differentiation and maturation of lymphocytes  <cit> . we now add data that methylation of cpg dinucleotides also may play a key role in controlling expression of a plethora of genes involved in directing tissue specificity and diverse organ function. it is unclear, however, if this methylation is the cause or simply a marker of gene silencing, and further studies will be required to distinguish between these hypotheses.

the extent that adult tissue-specific stem/progenitor cells retain this global permissive chromatin status is likely tied to the extent with which they retain pluripotency and little is known about dna methylation differences between cell lineages. this study showed that not only can tissue specific signatures be identified from global dna methylation patterns, but also the distance at embryonic origin between tissues can be determined. we found that heart and kidney are closer than heart and liver as well as kidney and liver in the distance of global dna methylation, reflecting heart and kidney has the same embryonic origin, mesoderm, whereas liver develops from endoderm. this finding might be utilized to trace the origin of cell lineage and discover the relationship between cell lineages.

in global genomic packaging, for all types of cells, dna methylation may be a key component of repressive chromatin which functions to give long-term silencing of transposons, stabilization of silenced genes in the processes of imprinting and x-inactivation  <cit> . mammalian females use x-chromosome inactivation to equalize the imbalance of x-chromosome gene expression created by females having two x chromosomes in contrast to the male xy. dense regions of cpg dinucleotides, termed cpg islands, along the entire x chromosome are also dna hypermethylated in the embryo  <cit> . out of  <dig> cpg markers that have the highest variability between heart, kidney and liver,  <dig> markers are located in x chromosome and were highly methylated only in female tissues. all these  <dig> markers except one are located in cpg islands. the marker that is not in a cpg island is for msn gene that encodes moesin. interestingly, even including these x chromosome inactivation genes, the  <dig> markers still correctly clustered all tissue samples.

promoter hypermethylation has been mainly associated with gene silencing  <cit> . however, in this study we found that dna methylation was either positively or negatively correlated with gene expression. because the majority of genes that have methylation variation between tissues showed correlation between methylation and transcriptional levels, such number of correlations was so significant that it could not be generated by chance. the number of negative correlations was only slightly larger than that of positive correlations and this difference was not significant. this result suggests two possibilities, either dna methylation is bi-directional in regulating gene expression or there is a multiple-factor complicated system that monitors gene expression during tissue differentiation. the location of cpg markers has been reported to be a factor to influence the effect of methylation on gene regulation  <cit> . we have tested locations, such as the distance to transcriptional start site  or whether inside or outside a cpg island, and failed to find they affect on the correlations of methylation and gene expression. this result need to be further investigated with denser methylation arrays, such as illumina infinium  <dig> k.

aberrant dna methylation is also a hallmark of most cancers and the changes begin in the earliest pre-malignant and hyperplastic lesions, and throughout tumor progression, and contributes significantly to the biology of cancer  <cit> , but the role of epigenetic/epigenomic changes in other diseases remains an area of active focus of many researchers. in order properly understand the consequence of dna methylation changes in various human disease states, we need to understand the epigenetic code of normal cells and the role that dna methylation places in directing tissue specificity. furthermore, as many disease states such as cancer may present cells with altered differentiation patterns  or characteristics of mixed lineages  we need to understand the patterns of dna methylation between different types of normal cells in order to properly gauge the significance of any aberrant findings. we believe that this study will help underscore the importance of methylation changes at cpg dinucleotides in the promoter regions of genes, and serve as a baseline to measure abnormal methylation changes associated with pathological conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied global dna methylation in three human tissues, heart, kidney and liver, and found that tissues have distinct dna methylation patterns. it underlines the existence of tissue-specific methylation signatures and implies an important role played by dna methylation in mediating normal tissue differentiation. by joining with transcriptome data measured by rna-seq, we were able to correlate most methylation variation between tissues with gene expression levels. it indicates that dna methylation influences normal tissue differentiation via regulating gene expression. further studies need to be carried out to verify our findings in other normal tissues and to investigate the genes and pathways that are involved in this biological process.
