BACKGROUND
clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium that has long been recognized as a significant cause of histotoxic and gastrointestinal  diseases in both humans and animals  <cit> . c. perfringens isolates can be classified into one of five types  based upon their ability to produce alpha-, beta-, epsilon- and iota-toxin  <cit> . although enterotoxin -producing c. perfringens type a isolates represent <5% of global c. perfringens population, these bacteria are very important human gi pathogens, causing c. perfringens type a food poisoning and non-food-borne gi diseases  <cit> . substantial experimental and epidemiological evidence  <cit>  now indicates that cpe plays a major role in the development of gi symptoms in cases of c. perfringens-associated food poisoning and non-food-borne gi diseases. in addition to producing cpe, c. perfringens food poisoning isolates have the ability to form heat-resistant spores, which can survive boiling for an hour or longer  <cit> . the possession of high spore heat-resistance facilitates the survival of c. perfringens spores in primary food vehicles  where, in the presence of appropriate nutrients, dormant spores are reverted to vegetative cells and multiply, and then cause food-borne illness after consumption of these contaminated foods  <cit> .

the molecular basis for c. perfringens spore heat-resistance remains unknown. however, since small, acid-soluble spore proteins  from bacillus subtilis can protect their spores from damage by heat and other environmental factors  <cit> , it is very likely that c. perfringens sasps play a similar role. spores of bacillus and clostridium species contain a number of sasps of molecular weight 5– <dig> kda, which comprise 10–20% of the total spore protein  <cit> . these proteins are classified into two groups based on their primary sequence, an α/β-type and a ϒ-type  <cit> . the b. subtilis α/β-type sasps are encoded by multiple genes and comprise a large protein family whose amino acid sequences are very highly conserved within and between species  <cit> . the b. subtilis α/β-type sasps are non-specific dna binding proteins which saturate the spore chromosome and protect spore dna from damage caused by heat, uv radiation, and peroxidase  <cit> . although an enormous number of studies on the role of sasps in b. subtilis spore resistance have been carried out, nothing is known about the role of c. perfringens sasps. however, the advance towards understanding the role of sasps in c. perfringens spore resistance is emerging from some old studies  <cit>  which revealed the existence of multiple α/β-type, but not ϒ-type, sasps in clostridium species. three genes  coding for α/β-type sasps have been cloned and nucleotide sequenced from c. perfringens old strains  <cit> . interestingly, only these three ssp genes, compared to at-least  <dig> ssp genes in b. subtilis  <cit> , were identified in the genome of c. perfringens strain  <dig>  <cit> . however, the presence and expression of these ssp genes in recent clinical c. perfringens food poisoning isolates and their role in spore heat-resistance remains unknown.

in the current study, we investigated the genetics and expression of ssp genes in c. perfringens clinical food poisoning isolates. our study also prepared an isogenic ssp <dig> knock-out mutant of a c. perfringens type a food poisoning isolate. the heat sensitivities of spores produced by ssp <dig> knock-out mutant was compared with that of spores of the wild type strain. the results from these experiments now provide evidence that c perfringens sasps play a role in spore heat-resistance.

RESULTS
pcr screening and comparison of ssp orfs in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates
we first subjected our collection of c. perfringens food poisoning isolates to ssp-specific pcr analysis to determine whether most, or all, cpe-positive food poisoning isolates carry all three ssp genes . control pcrs were run using template dna prepared from a known ssp-positive c. perfringens strain  <dig>  <cit> . when template dna isolated from each of our five surveyed clinical c. perfringens food poisoning isolates was subjected to this same ssp pcr analysis, pcr products of 239-, 306-, and 522-bp were invariably obtained . these results are in consistent with the known presence  of all three ssp orfs in the genome of the c. perfringens strain  <dig>  <cit> .

the nucleotide sequencing analyzes revealed  that no mutations or termination codons were found in the ssp <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> orf sequences of our five surveyed isolates that encode proteins of 60-, 59- or 60-aa, respectively. the ssp <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> orf sequences and also the upstream promoter sequences are highly conserved in all our surveyed food poisoning isolates and matches exactly with previously published sequences  <cit> .

evaluation of expression of ssp genes in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates
to examine the expression of ssp genes, the putative promoter regions of ssp <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> from c. perfringens food poisoning isolate sm <dig> was fused to e. coli gusa. these ssp-gusa fusion constructs were introduced into wild-type sm <dig> and β-glucuronidase  activity was measured during vegetative and sporulation growth. a promoter-less gusa construct was used as a negative control to ensure the specificity and reliability of the assay .

when gus assay was performed on sm <dig> carrying psg <dig> , psg <dig>  or psg <dig> , no significant expression of ssp <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> was observed in vegetative cells . however, sm <dig> carrying ssp1-, 2-or 3-gusa showed gus activity during sporulation. the ssp1-gusa expression began at ~ <dig> h after induction of sporulation, with maximum specific activity attained at ~ <dig> h after induction of sporulation . both ssp2-gusa and ssp3-gusa fusions were expressed beginning at ~ <dig> h after induction of sporulation, with maximum specific activity attained ~ <dig> h after induction of sporulation . collectively, these results suggest that all three ssp genes are expressed during sporulation, but not during vegetative growth.

to analyze the sporulation-dependent expression of ssp genes further, we examined the expression of ssp1-, 2- or 3-gusa fusion in a spo0a mutant of c. perfringens. the rationale for using spo0a mutant is that, if ssp expression is truly dependent on sporulation, ssp-gusa fusions would not be expressed in sporulation-deficient spo0a mutant of c. perfringens  <cit> . the ssp-gusa fusion constructs psg <dig> , psg <dig>  and psg <dig>  were introduced into c. perfringens spo0a mutant strain ih <dig> and gus activity was measured during sporulation growth. as shown in fig  <dig>  no detectable gus activity was obtained with sporulating cultures of ih <dig> carrying ssp1-,  <dig>  and 3-gusa fusions, confirming that the expression of ssp genes in c. perfringens are dependent on spo0a expression and sporulation.

sasp production by c. perfringens food poisoning isolates
having obtained evidence that all three ssp genes are expressed in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates, we next examined whether these isolates can, in fact, produce sasps. when acid-extracts of spores from representative c. perfringens food poisoning isolates sm <dig>  and nctc <dig>  were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at low ph, multiple protein bands were observed. western blot analysis, using antibodies against sspc of b. subtilis, detected sspc-specific immunoreactivity in acid-extracts of spores from sm <dig> and nctc <dig> . these results indicated that c. perfringens food poisoning isolates can produce sasps.

creation of ssp knock-out mutants
to evaluate the role of sasps in spore heat-resistance, we attempted to introduce knock-out mutations into each ssp gene. the mutator plasmid pdr <dig>  pdr <dig> or pmrs <dig>  carrying mutated allele Δssp1::catp, Δssp2::catp and Δssp3::catp, respectively, was introduced into c. perfringens strain sm <dig> by electroporation, and emrcmr transformants were selected. as a positive control of transformation, the c. perfringens-e. coli shuttle plasmid pjir <dig> encoding emr was included. the emrcmr transformants were obtained at ~1000-fold less frequencies than that of pjir751-derived emr transformants, which was expected because mutator plasmids pdr <dig>  pdr <dig> and pmrs <dig> have no origin of replication for c. perfringens. the single cross-over event of homologous recombination was confirmed by pcr using each ssp-specific primers . one transformant for each mutator plasmid was grown in the absence of both em and cm, and a double crossover event between each wild-type ssp and the respective mutated Δssp::catp allele was screened by selecting colonies for cmr and ems phenotypes. after screening of ~ <dig>  colonies from sm <dig> culture, we obtained one putative clone showing a cmr and ems phenotype. this putative ssp <dig> mutant was designated as dr <dig>  however, no cmr and ems clone was obtained after screening of > <dig>  colonies from each of sm <dig> and sm <dig> culture. our three repeated attempts using sm <dig> and sm <dig> transformants from three independent electroporations were failed to isolate spp <dig> and ssp <dig> mutant, respectively.

confirmation of dr <dig> as ssp <dig> knock-out mutant
inactivation of ssp <dig> in dr <dig> was first demonstrated by pcr analysis  using ssp3-specific primers. an ~ <dig> -kb fragment carrying ssp <dig> was amplified from dna of wild-type strain sm <dig>  in contrast, an ~ <dig> -kb pcr product was obtained from dna of mutant strain dr <dig>  these pcr results are consistent with the wild-type ssp <dig> gene in dr <dig> having been replaced with the mutated allele, carrying an extra ~ <dig> -kb catp-containing fragment.

southern blot analyses showed that a single hpai-digested dna fragment from wild-type strain sm <dig> hybridized with ssp3-specific probe . however, two hybridizing bands were observed with dna from mutant strain, dr <dig> . this profile is consistent with results expected since the ~ <dig> -kb catp-containing fragment has an internal hpai site. the catp-specific probe hybridized with an ~15-kb hpai fragment of dr <dig> dna, but as expected, no hybridizing band was observed with dna from wild type sm <dig> . these results further confirmed that wild-type ssp <dig> gene in dr <dig> having been replaced with Δssp3::catp allele.

sporulation and cpe production by ssp <dig> mutant
we first compared the sporulation capability of the ssp <dig> mutant against that of its wild-type. both the mutant strain dr <dig> and wild-type strain sm <dig> exhibited significant sporulation, i.e., refractile endospores were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy after  <dig> h growth in ds medium . when we compared the cpe producing capabilities of the wild-type strain sm <dig> and ssp <dig> knock-out mutant dr <dig>  an ~35-kda cpe-specific immunoreactive band was detected in western blots of lysates prepared from sporulating cultures of both sm <dig> and dr <dig> . quantitative analyses demonstrated similar level of cpe production in both sm <dig> and dr <dig> .

comparison of the heat sensitivities of spores produced by c. perfringens food poisoning isolate carrying wild-type versus knock-out ssp3
in order to determine whether ssp <dig> has any role in spore heat-resistance, we performed experiments to evaluate the heat sensitivities of spores produced by c. perfringens wild-type and ssp <dig> mutant. representative thermal death curves obtained at 100°c for heat-shocked sporulating cultures of wild-type sm <dig> and ssp <dig> mutant dr <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  from the fig.  <dig> results, we calculated that spores of sm <dig>  carrying the wild-type ssp <dig> gene, had a d value of ~ <dig> min at 100°c, while spores of dr <dig>  an isogenic ssp <dig> mutant, had a d value of ~ <dig> min. to further confirm our results, three additional d values at 100°c for heat-shocked sporulating cultures of dr <dig> and sm <dig> were determined using three independent thermal death curves . these results demonstrated that spores produced by the ssp <dig> mutant had, on average, approximately  <dig> -fold-lower d value at 100°c than spores produced by the wild-type strain .

in order to determine whether the observed differences in d values between spores of sm <dig> and spores of dr <dig> was due to the specific inactivation of ssp <dig>  d value was determined at 100°c for heat-shocked sporulating cultures of complemented strain dr <dig>  as calculated from fig.  <dig>  spores produced by dr <dig> had a wild-type level d value i.e., ~ <dig> min at 100°c. this finding was confirmed by three independent experiments. collectively, our results indicated that the reduced heat-resistance of spores produced by the ssp <dig> knock-out mutant was caused by the specific inactivation of ssp <dig> 

protection of plasmid dna against dnase i
since b. subtilis sasps have been shown to bind double-stranded dna and protect against dnase cleavage  <cit> , we wondered whether c. perfringens sasps can do the same. we purified total sasps from c. perfringens sm <dig>  and performed sasp-dna binding assay by measuring the ability of sasps to protect plasmid  dna from dnase i digestion. as shown in fig.  <dig> , when pjir <dig> dna was incubated with dnase i, no dna band was observed after agarose gel elctrophoresis , indicating that dnase i is enzymatically active and completely digested the pjir <dig> dna. however, when pjir <dig> dna was incubated with c. perfringens sasps prior to dnase i treatment, discrete dna fragments remained after dnase i treatment . furthermore, the incomplete digestion of sasp-treated dna was not due to the inhibition of dnase i activity by urea because the enzyme was completely functional in the presence of  <dig> m urea  that was used to dissolve sasps. collectively, these results indicated that sasps protected plasmid dna against dnase i digestion. similar results were obtained in our three independent experiments . this observation indicated that the function of sasps in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates is similar to that in b. subtilis, i.e., they protect spores from heat-damage by binding to spore dna.

discussion
c. perfringens type a food poisoning, which currently ranks as the third most commonly reported food-borne disease in the united states  <cit> , is caused by enterotoxigenic c. perfringens type a isolates that typically possess high spore heat-resistance  <cit> . the possession of high spore heat-resistance favors the survival of c. perfringens food poisoning isolates during incomplete cooking or inadequate holding of foods, which are the two major factors contributing to c. perfringens type a food-borne illness  <cit> . however, the molecular basis for c. perfringens spore heat-resistance remains unknown. in the current study, we hypothesized that sasps produced by c. perfringens food poisoning isolates can play a role in the resistance of their spores to heat.

our current study demonstrated the presence of all three ssp genes in a large number of clinical c. perfringens food poisoning isolates. nucleotide sequencing revealed that the ssp orfs in our surveyed isolates are intact, i.e., no mutations or premature termination codons were detected in the orfs. although previous studies  <cit>  reported the presence of ssp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in c. perfringens laboratory strains, to our knowledge, our study is the first to compare all three ssp orfs between a large number of clinical cpe-positive c. perfringens food poisoning isolates. the deduced amino acid sequence of sasps from our surveyed c. perfringens food poisoning isolates are identical to that of the c. perfringens sasps published earlier  <cit>  and homologous to α/β-type sasps of b. subtilis  <cit>  indicating that the ssp orfs present in food poisoning isolates are indeed ssp genes.

this study report evidences that the ssp genes present in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates are functional. our gus assay showed that ssp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from a food poisoning isolate sm <dig> were expressed during sporulation, but not during vegetative growth, and expression begins ~3– <dig> h after induction of sporulation. these results suggest that the mechanism of regulation of c. perfringens sasps may be similar as that of b. subtilis. in b. subtilis, sasps synthesis begins 3– <dig> h into sporulation, when all three major sasps are synthesized in parallel  <cit> . the differential expression of ssp genes  can not be explained by the differences in ribosome binding sites  because the putative rbs is highly conserved among the three ssp genes . further support for the sporulation-dependent expression of c. perfringens ssp genes came from our observations that no gus activity was detected in spo0a mutant ih <dig> carrying ssp1-, 2- or 3-gusa fusion. consistent with these expression results, our study also provides evidence that c. perfringens food poisoning isolates can, in fact, produce sasps. the multiple protein bands obtained in our study from acid extracts of spores produced by food poisoning isolates  were also observed previously  <cit>  in acid extracts of spores produced by c. perfringens nctc <dig>  the identity of these acid-soluble spore proteins as sasps was confirmed by western blot analyses using b. subtilis sspc antibody . the single immunoreactive band observed in western blot can be explained by the fact that c. perfringens ssp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are highly homologous  to each other and encode similar sized proteins . collectively, the presence and expression of ssp genes in c. perfringens food poisoning isolates, which possess high spore heat-resistance as indicated in a previous study  <cit> , significantly strengthen the hypothesis that sasps are associated with heat-resistance of spores produced by these isolates.

the present study's most significant finding is the presentation of the first genetic evidence that c. perfringens sasps play a role in heat-resistance of spores produced by c. perfringens. the inactivation of ssp <dig> significantly affected the heat-resistance of spores produced by a food poisoning isolate sm <dig>  our findings that i) spores of ssp <dig> knock-out mutant exhibited lower heat-resistance than that of the spores of wild type and ii) reversion of this effect by complementing the mutant with a recombinant plasmid carrying wild type ssp <dig>  provided direct genetic evidence supporting the strong linkage between the production of sasps and the resistance of spores to heat. the slight reduction of d value in spores of ssp <dig> mutant compared to the d value of spores of wild-type can be explained by the presence of the functional ssp <dig> and ssp <dig> genes in ssp <dig> mutant strain dr <dig>  our dna protection assay also supports the role of c. perfringens sasps in spore heat-resistance by demonstrating that c. perfringens sasps, like b. subtilis sasps  <cit> , can protect plasmid dna from dnase i digestion. further studies on characterization of sasp-dna binding and the effect of this binding on plasmid topology should help in understanding the mechanism of interaction between dna and sasps from c. perfringens.

to our knowledge, this report represents the first successful study involving the construction of a c. perfringens ssp knock-out mutant. the greatest challenge faced in our ssp knock-out study was the lack of an easy screening method for the second cross-over event. although in our first attempt, using the double-antibiotic selection strategy  <cit> , we were able to isolate ssp <dig> knock-out mutant, our three similar independent attempts were failed to isolate ssp <dig> and ssp <dig> mutant. the reasons for these failures can not be explained by the lack of sufficient amount of homologous dna in mutator plasmids  <cit>  because, both pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> carry at-least  <dig> -kb homologous dna located on either side of the insertionally inactivated ssp gene that should be sufficient to allow double-reciprocal crossover event  <cit> . it is also unlikely that incorporation of catp in ssp <dig> or ssp <dig> can cause polar effect on the downstream gene whose expression is essential for the survival of c. perfringens cells because our nucleotide sequencing analyses  demonstrated that neither ssp <dig> nor ssp <dig> forms an operon with any downstream gene in the genome of sm <dig>  therefore, further research is needed to identify the relevant obstacles for isolating ssp <dig> and ssp <dig> mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study demonstrated that i) all three ssp genes are present and expressed in a large number of clinical c. perfringens food poisoning isolates, ii) ssp <dig> knock-out mutant of c. perfringens food poisoning isolate possess lower spore-heat resistance compared to that of its parent strain and this effect could be restored by complementing the mutant with wild-type ssp <dig> gene, and iii) sasps from c. perfringens food poisoning isolate can protect dna from dnase i digestion. collectively, these results support our initial hypothesis that sasps produced by c. perfringens food poisoning isolates can play a role in resistance of their spores to heat. these findings are highly significant and relevant from a food safety perspective because the possession of high spore heat-resistance favors the survival of c. perfringens food poisoning isolates in primary food vehicles  contributing to c. perfringens food-borne illnesses  <cit> . further detailed studies on mechanism of action of sasps from c. perfringens should help in understanding the mechanism of protection of c. perfringens spores from damage caused by heat and other environmental stresses.
