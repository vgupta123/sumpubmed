BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are the largest class of membrane proteins, accounting for 2% of genes in the human genome  <cit> . in general, gpcrs are responsible for modulating signals from the extracellular environment and transducing these stimuli into intracellular signaling cascades and cellular responses. gpcrs are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including cell movement, neurotransmission and olfaction, and can also be involved in disease progression with roles in metastasis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and inflammation  <cit> . since gpcrs are involved in maintaining homeostasis as well as disease progression, gpcrs are an important group of proteins to study, informing basic cellular and molecular biology as well as pharmaceutical applications.

although there are many different genes encoding for gpcrs, all gpcrs share a common structure. gpcrs have seven transmembrane α-helices  connected by three intracellular and three extracellular loops. there are five main families of human gpcrs   <cit> , and this classification holds true for gpcrs in other bilateral species  <cit> .

gpcrs are inherently difficult to crystallize due to their transmembrane nature and the fact that individual gpcrs are typically expressed at low levels within cells. gpcrs, like other transmembrane proteins, require a membrane-like environment to remain in a properly folded conformation. the required presence of a membrane makes the overexpression and subsequent purification of gpcrs challenging. the first gpcr crystal structure, bovine rhodopsin, was determined in  <dig>  <cit> , with nearly seven years passing before a crystal structure for the second gpcr was published. to date there are  <dig> gpcrs crystallized, all representing the rhodopsin family of gpcrs  <cit> . additionally, six of these proteins  have been crystallized in active-like states  <cit> .

due to the difficulties of gpcr purification and crystallization, protein structure prediction programs and molecular dynamics  simulations are frequently used to investigate the structures of gpcrs. there are currently three computational techniques available to generate a three-dimensional structural prediction of a protein: homology modeling, threading, and ab initio modeling. homology modeling builds a three-dimensional structure by first identifying an evolutionarily related homologous protein with a known structure to use as a template. the program then aligns the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest to the amino acid sequence of the chosen template and finally builds the model  <cit> . the relatively low number of gpcr crystal structures is a major limitation to homology modeling. a lack of diverse structures means that a majority of gpcrs will still lack a homologous protein to use as a template. it is possible to build a highly accurate model when the template protein and the protein sequence of interest share 50% or more sequence identity  <cit> . however, when the sequence identity is below 30%, the protein structure prediction will likely more closely resemble the template structure than the native structure of the protein  <cit> . the sequence identity between crystallized gpcrs and other known gpcrs is often below 30%  <cit> . due to the prevalence of low sequence identity, it is suggested that both sequence identity and structural information be used when choosing the template protein  <cit> .

threading, similar to homology modeling, is a template-based approach to structure prediction. the first step in threading is to search for evolutionary relatives to the protein sequence of interest. this is commonly accomplished with position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool   <cit> . psi-blast generates a sequence profile, which is used by a secondary structure predictor, like psipred  <cit> , to determine the secondary structure of the protein sequence of interest. both the secondary structure and the sequence profile from psi-blast are used in a threading algorithm to identify template proteins from the protein data bank that have similar protein folds to the sequence of interest. templates used in threading may show no evolutionary relationship  <cit> . the use of multiple templates, creating a chimeric gpcr, has been shown to provide a more accurate model than using a single protein template  <cit> . multiple templates can be used in both homology modeling and threading.

ab initio modeling builds a three-dimensional protein model from sequence information alone, without using a template structure, based upon the assumption that the protein structure will assume the lowest free energy conformation  <cit> . ab initio modeling can work well for proteins with less than  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . although there are three different ways to build a protein structure prediction, some current modeling programs use a combination of approaches to predict a structure  <cit> . the accuracy of the final model is linked to the template chosen, and some approaches to generating a protein structural prediction work better on certain proteins or parts of proteins than others  <cit> .

with only  <dig> distinct gpcr proteins crystallized, it can be difficult to find a suitable template to use with the modeling software. part of this challenge has been alleviated by the availability of web servers specifically designed for modeling gpcrs, such as gpcr-modsim  <cit>  and gpcr-iterative threading assembly refinement   <cit> . gpcr-modsim is a server that allows investigators to model gpcrs using modeller  <cit>  and gpcr-modsim users have the option of choosing whether to align their gpcr sequence with inactive-like crystallized gpcrs or active-like crystallized gpcrs. gpcr-modsim aligns the sequence and shows the percent identity with the available templates. the user can then choose which template to use and gpcr-modsim generates a homology model using modeller. once a homology model is generated, the user has the option of submitting it for md simulations in a solvated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer  <cit> .

gpcr-itasser is another web server that allows for protein structure prediction  <cit> . gpcr-itasser takes the initial gpcr sequence and identifies evolutionary relatives using psi-blast and secondary structures using psipred. the results from psi-blast and psipred are used by the local meta-threading server  to find potential templates in the protein data bank. any sequence without a matched template is modeled using an ab initio helix-modeling program. additional restraints to the protein structure are incorporated through the use of the online database gpcrrd , which contains experimental restraints from other gpcr databases and literature  <cit> . the ab initio modeling, results from threading, and restraints from the gpcrrd are all used to assemble and build a structural model. this structural model is refined using fragment-guided molecular dynamics  <cit>  to give the final model.

in this study, the gpcr-modsim  <cit>  and the gpcr-itasser  <cit>  web servers were used to predict protein structures of the gpcr trapped in endoderm- <dig> . tre <dig> is a rhodopsin family gpcr required for proper drosophila melanogaster primordial germ cell migration  <cit> . in a mutant form of the protein, tre1sctt, primordial germ cell migration is severely disrupted. the primordial germ cells scatter across the posterior half of the embryo rather than populating the two gonads. the molecular lesion in tre1sctt rna is a point mutation that results in an in-frame deletion of eight amino acids, ryiliach  <cit> . two of these amino acids  are part of the highly conserved d/e/nry motif in tm <dig> of rhodopsin family gpcrs. the d/e/nry motif is thought to act as a micro-switch in the activation mechanism of rhodopsin family gpcrs  <cit> , and the arginine is conserved in 96% of rhodopsin family gpcrs  <cit> . the arginine of the d/e/nry motif  can form a salt bridge with tm <dig> in numerous gpcrs  <cit> , and while the exact role of the salt bridge is unknown  <cit> , it is clear that the arginine is very important for tre1+ function  <cit> . the first position of the d/e/nry motif is also highly conserved. it is an acidic residue  or glutamic acid ) in 86% of gpcrs  <cit> . in some gpcrs, the aspartic acid or glutamic acid can interact with the neighboring arginine to form an intrahelical salt bridge in addition to the interaction with tm <dig>  <cit> . since an acidic residue in the first position of the motif is not present in tre <dig> , an intrahelical salt bridge with the arginine does not form. this could make the interhelical salt bridge with tm <dig> more important.

protein structure predictions of putative inactive structures of both tre1+ and tre1sctt were generated with gpcr-modsim  <cit>  and gpcr-itasser  <cit> . the namd simulation package  <cit>  was used to perform md simulations on both tre1+ and tre1sctt embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine  lipid bilayer, and md simulations were run on four different model systems for over 250 ns each. the proteins were embedded in a pope lipid bilayer since phosphoethanolamine is the most abundant phospholipid in drosophila cell membranes  <cit> . the nry motif of tre <dig> was studied by examining the possibility of salt bridge formation between the arginine of the nry motif and an aspartic acid residue of tm <dig>  one of the wild type tre <dig> model systems shows potential for a strong salt bridge to form between r <dig> of the nry motif and d <dig> of tm <dig>  the distances between the residues are favorable for salt bridge formation and could indicate that the salt bridge promotes interhelical stabilization of the tre <dig> gpcr. the lack of similar interactions in the mutant model systems with an alternative arginine residue as well as in vivo data with tre1sctt <cit>  suggests that the arginine of the nry motif is important to the function and maintenance of an inactive structure that allows for subsequent activation of the tre <dig> gpcr.

RESULTS
protein structure prediction
the amino acid sequences for tre1+ and tre1sctt were used for protein structure predictions using gpcr-modsim  <cit>  and gpcr-itasser  <cit> . both gpcr-modsim and gpcr-itasser are web servers for gpcr protein structure prediction, however the web servers differ in the approach taken to generate a protein structure prediction. the gpcr-modsim server automates the process of using the homology modeling program modeller to model gpcrs  <cit> , while gpcr-itasser uses multiple threading programs as well as the gpcr research database to predict protein structures  <cit> . these two web servers were used in this study to generate four independent protein structure predictions, two each for tre1+ and tre1sctt. while modeller is an established program that has been used to predict gpcr structures for simulations before, this is the first study to use structural predictions from gpcr-itasser.

tre1+ and tre1sctt were modeled to the seven inactive-like gpcrs on the gpcr-modsim web server. from the multiple sequence alignment generated, it was clear that any one of the seven available gpcr crystal structures could be used as a template to model tre1+ and tre1sctt. however, gpcr-modsim allows only one template to be chosen, and for both tre1+ and tre1sctt the template chosen was squid rhodopsin . not only did squid rhodopsin show the highest total sequence identity to tre1+ and tre1sctt  , but also squid rhodopsin seemed to be the best choice from earlier work using the web server i-tasser. the i-tasser web server uses threading to generate a structural prediction of a protein and allows a user to submit a sequence with or without selecting a template to use  <cit> . the structural prediction from i-tasser using tre1+ sequence and no selected template looked most similar to the structural prediction when squid rhodopsin was chosen as a template . therefore, squid rhodopsin was selected as the most appropriate template. using squid rhodopsin as a template, ten models each for tre1+ and tre1sctt were generated using modeller. the two models chosen for further study using md simulations were selected based on the lowest discrete optimized protein energy  score  <cit>  and are named mtre <dig>  and msctt .

* denotes the template chosen for homology modeling.

the second set of independent protein structure predictions for tre1+ and tre1sctt were built using gpcr-itasser  <cit> . the amino acid sequences for tre1+ and tre1sctt were submitted to gpcr-itasser and used in the local threading server to find template proteins. both tre1+ and tre1sctt were modeled to substance p, human β2-adrenergic receptor, bovine rhodopsin and human a2a adenosine receptor. in addition, tre1+ was modeled to turkey β1-adrenergic receptor and human β2-adrenergic receptor-gs protein complex, while tre1sctt was modeled to squid rhodopsin. even though an active gpcr  was a template for the tre1+ model, it is thought that this tre1+ model reflects an inactive conformation of the protein as the resulting model from gpcr-itasser is a consensus of restraints from six templates, all but one being inactive. the two best models, based on gpcr-itasser confidence scores, were chosen for further study in md simulations. the models generated by gpcr-itasser are named gtre <dig>  and gsctt .

the four models, mtre <dig>  msctt, gtre <dig>  and gsctt, selected for further study are shown in figure 1a. at first glance, all four of the models look similar, but there are distinct differences. namely, helices  <dig> and  <dig>  are roughly the same length as the other five helices in mtre <dig> and msctt . in gtre <dig> and gsctt, helices  <dig> and  <dig> are extended relative to the other five helices. helical extensions of helices  <dig> and  <dig> are present in the crystal structure of squid rhodopsin   <cit>  which was used as a template structure for mtre <dig>  msctt, and gsctt. these differences change the architecture of intracellular loop  <dig>  additionally, intracellular loop  <dig>  has different structures in mtre <dig> and gtre <dig> . in mtre <dig>  this loop region is unstructured. in contrast, there is a short helix in intracellular loop  <dig> in gtre <dig>  these differences in intracellular loop structure can be attributed to the template structure used to generate mtre <dig> and gtre <dig>  intracellular loop  <dig> is of interest since it is the location of some of the residues missing in tre1sctt.

building biologically relevant model systems
as gpcrs exist in a membrane environment, the four different protein structure predictions were inserted into a solvated pope lipid bilayer using the membrane builder in the charmm-gui  <cit> . the final solvated membrane systems are named the same as the structural predictions, mtre <dig>  msctt, gtre <dig> and gsctt. each system was subjected to over 250 ns of md and an example of the mtre <dig> system after md is shown in figure  <dig> 

experimental work has shown that at 310 k a pope lipid in a pope lipid bilayer maintains a surface area of  <dig>  –  <dig>  Å <dig> <cit> . to confirm the correct surface areas per lipid were maintained in mtre <dig>  msctt, gtre <dig> and gsctt, the voronoi tesselation and monte carlo  integration method  <cit>  was used. this method allows for calculation of the surface area per lipid in membrane-lipid systems. vtmc calculates the surface area per boundary and non-boundary lipids. non-boundary lipids are described as those lipids not interacting with atoms of the protein. it is important to make the distinction between lipid types  since lipids interacting with atoms of the protein will have a decreased surface area per lipid. the results of the vtmc analysis are shown in table  <dig> and confirm that the non-boundary lipids in each of the model systems maintained the correct surface area per lipid, ranging from  <dig>  –  <dig>  Å <dig> 

average surface areas per lipid were calculated using the voronoi tessellation monte carlo integration method  <cit>  and calculated at the end of each simulation for all model systems. a boundary lipid is a lipid that contacts an atom from the protein and a non-boundary lipid is a lipid that makes no contact with protein atoms. experimental values of surface area per non-boundary pope lipid is  <dig>  –  <dig>  Å <dig> <cit> . computationally determined surface area per non-boundary pope lipid using charmm <dig> is  <dig>  Å <dig> <cit> .

global movements of the model systems
root mean squared deviation  was computed over the course of the simulation for the cα atoms of the transmembrane regions of the proteins to measure structural stability . as seen from the curves in figure  <dig>  the rmsd values did not change significantly from the starting structure and each curve began to stabilize after 150 ns of dynamics. this suggests that the systems have equilibrated. further confirmation of structural stability after 150 ns can be seen from the curves of the rmsd values calculated for the complete proteins computed over the course of the simulation .

root mean squared fluctuation  was also used as a way to qualitatively characterize the protein dynamics. here, rmsf describes the fluctuations of each cα atom of the amino acid residues in the proteins averaged over the simulation time, beginning at 150 ns . the general fluctuations of specific regions of the proteins are similar between each of the tre1+ and tre1sctt models. it is clear from all four plots that the regions of the protein with the least amount of movement are the transmembrane regions. intracellular loop  <dig> shows the greatest fluctuations, which is expected since it is the longest loop in tre <dig>  of all the model systems, intracellular loop  <dig> of gsctt has the highest rmsf values. the high degree of fluctuation seen in intracellular loop  <dig> of gsctt could be due to its architecture, as intracellular loop  <dig> is more helical in gsctt than it is in mtre <dig>  msctt, and gtre <dig>  in gsctt, intracellular loop  <dig> begins as a helical extension of tm <dig>  and then it has an unstructured loop region, followed by another helical region that connects with tm <dig>  the high rmsf values in intracellular loop  <dig> in gsctt come from the residues in intracellular loop  <dig> that are in the unstructured loop. it is possible that the more rigid α-helical segments in intracellular loop  <dig> in gsctt prevent some of the other, unstructured residues in the loop from making important contacts with other parts of the protein. this could cause higher rmsf values.

a third qualitative assessment of the simulations was an all-to-all rmsd calculation on the transmembrane cα atoms of the tre <dig> protein, shown in figure  <dig> as heat maps. heat maps of all-to-all rmsd calculations show the number of different states the protein has visited during the course of the simulation. the darker diagonal blocks in each plot show when the tre <dig> protein  explores conformations that are structurally very similar. darker off-diagonal blocks suggest that the protein revisits a conformation over the course of the simulation, although in this case, low rmsd alone is not sufficient to guarantee that two, noncontiguous in time, structures are similar  <cit> . in the heat maps shown here, each simulation samples two or more conformational substates. the quality of sampling is comparable to the sampling obtained at 250 ns in previous md simulations of gpcrs  <cit> .

the final protein structures after the dynamics in a lipid bilayer are shown in figure 1c . in general, the transmembrane regions of the protein structures did not change drastically from the initial structures. some of the loops have changed considerably, but the distinctions between the initial structures generated by gpcr-modsim and gpcr-itasser noted previously are still present. to quantitatively determine changes in secondary structure over the course of the simulations, the dictionary of secondary structure of proteins  <cit>  was used . these plots confirm the seven transmembrane helices remain stable throughout the simulation, and the termini and loops are regions of change. while the significance of the differences between the gpcr-modsim and gpcr-itasser models remain to be understood, it is interesting that even after over 250 ns of md, some of the structural differences between the model systems were not resolved. this could mean that the structural models generated by the different modeling programs represent different protein conformations of tre <dig> 

studies of the nry motif of tre1
from previous genetic studies, it is known that the arginine of the nry motif  in tre <dig> is critical to the function of this gpcr  <cit> . other than the critical nature of the arginine to tre <dig> function, very little is known about the potential structural roles for this amino acid. it is possible that the arginine of the nry motif in tm <dig> is involved in forming a salt bridge with an aspartic acid residue in tm <dig>  a similar salt bridge in other gpcrs is thought to be important for holding gpcrs in inactive or activated states  <cit> . if there is a salt bridge in tre <dig> between the arginine of the nry motif and an aspartic acid residue in tm <dig>  loss of this arginine could remove this salt bridge and impair function, which would be consistent with experimental observations that germ cell migration requires this arginine in tre <dig> for function  <cit> . it is also possible that an alternative arginine just downstream of the deleted amino acids in tre1sctt could be used to form a salt bridge with tm <dig>  this alternative salt bridge could explain why the tre1sctt allele does not appear to be a complete loss-of-function allele of the tre <dig> gene. in tre1+ the sequence around the arginine is nryiliachsr*y. in tre1sctt, the amino acids ryiliach are missing and the remaining sequence is nsr*y. the arginine of the nry motif in tre1+ is numbered as r <dig>  the arginine r* in tre1sctt, the alternative arginine, is numbered as r <dig>  meaning this alternative arginine is located one residue from where the original arginine is located in tre1+. therefore, this alternative arginine could be close enough to form a salt bridge in the tre1sctt protein. to test this hypothesis, the potential for salt bridge formation was evaluated in all model systems. here, a salt bridge is defined as a noncovalent interaction between the carboxylate group of aspartic acid  and the guanidium group of arginine . as aspartic acid residues have two oxygen atoms that could be involved in a salt bridge, and arginine residues have two nitrogen atoms that could be involved in a salt bridge, the distance between both of the oxygen atoms of the aspartic acid in tm <dig> and both of the nitrogen atoms of the arginine in tm <dig> were calculated and plotted over the simulation time . interatomic distances of  <dig>  Å or less were considered favorable for salt bridge formation and such distances were seen in mtre <dig>  gtre <dig>  and msctt. the atoms studied in gsctt were never close enough to form a salt bridge. as shown in figure 7b, the nitrogen atoms of r <dig> in gsctt are not oriented towards the oxygen atoms of the aspartic acid residue in tm <dig> as they are in the gtre <dig> system . the md simulation of gtre <dig> shows interatomic n-o distances of  <dig>  Å or less for  <dig> of the  <dig> possible n-o pairs throughout most of the simulation . n-o distances in mtre <dig> were consistently greater than  <dig>  Å except for ~75 ns towards the end of the simulation . the differences in interatomic n-o distances between mtre <dig> and gtre <dig> could be due to different conformations of tre <dig> being represented or due to inherent differences in the initial protein structure predictions. msctt does not appear to be able to form a stable salt bridge using the alternative arginine, r <dig>  as correct interatomic n-o distances are only transiently seen over the course of the simulation. to ensure the differences in interatomic n-o distances were not due to differences in the distance between tm <dig> and tm <dig> carbon backbones, the cα-cα distances were measured between the arginine  in tm <dig> and aspartic acid  in tm <dig> in all systems. plots of the cα-cα distances over the course of the simulation showed that the distances between the residues studied here were similar .

discussion
the tre <dig> gpcr is an important component of primordial germ cell migration in drosophila  <cit> . in a severe partial loss-of-function allele of the tre <dig> gene, tre1sctt, proper primordial germ cell migration is disrupted. the tre1sctt protein is missing eight amino acids, ryiliach, from the junction of the third transmembrane domain and second intracellular loop  <cit> . this study was performed to analyze how the loss of the amino acids ryiliach may affect tre <dig> structure.

protein structure predictions were generated for tre1+ and tre1sctt using gpcr-modsim  <cit>  and gpcr-itasser  <cit> . the four resulting structures were inserted into a pope lipid bilayer and subjected to over 250 ns of md simulations each. interesting insights into the structures of tre1+ and tre1sctt were gained from this study. first, as shown by the rmsd versus time plots and the rmsf plots , tre1+ and tre1sctt behave similarly. the rmsd values for both tre1+ and tre1sctt protein structure predictions begin to stabilize around 150 ns of each md run. also, as shown by figure  <dig>  the general fluctuations of specific regions of the proteins are similar between tre1+ and tre1sctt.

the only primary sequence difference between tre1+ and tre1sctt is that tre1sctt is missing the eight amino acids ryiliach. of the eight amino acids, the arginine is the most conserved residue, being present in 96% of rhodopsin family gpcrs  <cit> . the arginine and the tyrosine are part of a highly conserved d/e/nry motif in rhodopsin family gpcrs  <cit> . the d/e/nry motif is thought to have roles as a micro-switch, being involved in holding the gpcr in an active or inactive state by forming a salt bridge with an aspartic acid residue or a glutamic acid residue in tm <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the arginine is also the most critical residue of the amino acids ryiliach for proper primordial germ cell migration in drosophila. when the arginine is substituted by an alanine, a severe loss-of-function germ cell phenotype is observed  <cit> . the germ cell phenotype from the arginine substitution is indistinguishable from the phenotype when the amino acids ryiliach are missing. based upon this knowledge, it was hypothesized that a salt bridge involving the conserved d/e/nry motif is present in tre1+ and absent in tre1sctt. a salt bridge with the d/e/nry motif could be important for maintaining tre1+ in a conformation required for efficient ligand binding. the lack of salt bridge in tre1sctt could alter the protein conformation such that the ligand cannot recognize the receptor. it is also possible that an alternative salt bridge using a nearby arginine could be formed in tre1sctt. if an alternative salt bridge forms, it could be involved in restoring some function of the gpcr.

the ability of the four model systems to form a salt bridge  was examined. wild-type systems, mtre <dig> and gtre <dig>  confirm that it is possible for a salt bridge to form between the arginine of the nry motif  and an aspartic acid  in tm <dig>  the salt bridge analysis using the mutant systems, msctt and gsctt, present a different picture. while it is possible for a salt bridge to form between the alternative arginine  and the aspartic acid of tm <dig>  in the msctt system, the salt bridge would not be very stable. distances favorable for salt bridge formation were not consistently present during the simulation . it is clear from figure  <dig> that no salt bridge would be expected to form in gsctt. it is possible that the salt bridge seen in gtre <dig> promotes interhelical stabilization of the protein, and this stabilization could be important for proper function of tre <dig>  the inability to form a stable salt bridge could disrupt tre1sctt protein structure making it unable to properly receive its ligand, or could alter the confirmation of tre1sctt such that it cannot bind interacting proteins. an alternative explanation for the salt bridge analysis results is that the systems have not been sufficiently sampled , and a salt bridge could still form in the tre1sctt forms of the protein.

with the salt bridge analysis there are significant differences between the independent model systems for tre1+ and tre1sctt. while it is possible that the different model systems represent two different protein conformations of tre <dig>  it is also possible that these differences can be attributed to how the protein structure predictions were generated. mtre <dig> and msctt were built using gpcr-modsim  <cit>  which uses the homology modeling program modeller. gtre <dig> and gsctt were built using gpcr-itasser  <cit>  which predicts protein structures through the use of threading. to further study tre <dig> structure, a third independent structure of tre <dig> could be built. for example, gpcr-sequence structure feature extractor  could be used to generate another starting structure. gpcr-ssfe is a database in addition to a homology modeling program that creates homology models of gpcrs using multiple templates and the program modeller  <cit> . the ability to use multiple templates is significant since the use of multiple templates with modeller has been shown to give more accurate homology models than using a single template  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the role of the arginine of the nry motif in tre <dig> was investigated. it is known from previous work that this arginine is critical to the proper function of the tre <dig> gpcr in drosophila primordial germ cell migration  <cit> . whether or not it is important for tre <dig> structure was unknown. the results presented here suggest that a salt bridge may form between this critical arginine and an aspartic acid in tm <dig> in tre <dig> 

gpcrs are a common class of proteins involved in cell migration. similar to how tre <dig> is involved in drosophila primordial germ cell migration, another gpcr, cxcr <dig>  is important for proper primordial germ cell migration in mouse, zebrafish and chicken  <cit> . like tre <dig>  cxcr <dig> contains the highly conserved d/e/nry motif. while a salt bridge with the arginine of the dry motif was not present in the crystal structure of the human cxcr <dig>  <cit> , it would be interesting to learn if the arginine of the dry motif is important to the structure of mouse, zebrafish or chicken cxcr <dig> and what implications this would have on primordial germ cell migration. the importance of the arginine to both the function  <cit>  and structure of tre <dig> could also mean that the arginine of the dry motif in cxcr <dig> is important for its structure and function.

primordial germ cell migration is an important process to study as it serves as a model for cell migration. in many animals, the primordial germ cells are formed at a place distant to the presumptive gonads requiring the primordial germ cells to migrate to their target tissues. in order for the primordial germ cells to properly migrate to the presumptive gonads, the primordial germ cells are required to initiate migration, migrate through various tissues, evade or suppress cell death mechanisms and respond to directional cues. the study of primordial germ cell migration as a model for cell migration will help to better understand the mechanisms of cell movements, enabling the development of new techniques or approaches to treat cancer or other diseased states caused by improper cell migration.
