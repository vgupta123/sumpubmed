BACKGROUND
with the growing commercialization of nanotechnology products, human exposure to manufactured nanoparticles  is increasing, raising concerns about their potential toxicity. synthetic, amorphous silica nps are a raw material for the manufacture of many nanocomposites, such as cosmetics, foods, drugs, and printing ink additives, on a large industrial scale  <cit> . the toxicity of crystalline silica, the inhalation of which is involved in many lung diseases, such as silicosis, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis, has been widely studied  <cit> . however, few studies have been performed on amorphous silica, because it exists in many diverse forms of natural or synthetic origin  <cit> . industrial processes use synthetic amorphous silica nanoparticles for the easy control of size, shape and physical properties. fumed  silica is prepared by the oxidation of silicon tetrachloride at elevated temperature, leading to a very low bulk density and high specific surface area nanopowder . fumed silica is used extensively as strengthening filler and thickening agent in a wide variety of products, such as foodstuffs, paints, printing inks  and adhesives. it also serves as a desiccant and is frequently added to cosmetics and toothpastes due to its respective light-diffusing and mild-abrasive properties. along with applications in polyester, silicone, paints, and coatings, hydrophilic fumed silica aerosil® products are used with increasing success in high-technology fields such as electronics and optical fiber industries. fumed silica poses an inhalation risk due to its extremely fine structure and the workers synthesizing or using it may be the first population exposed.

some in vivo toxicological studies have been carried out with aerosil products. reuzel et al. showed that aerosil®  <dig>  led to a clear dose–response relationship and to the accumulation of alveolar macrophages  <cit> . of the amorphous silicas examined, aerosil®  <dig> induced the most severe changes in the lungs of rats, which only partly recovered. previous in vitro studies also showed that amorphous silica nanoparticles were toxic to lung cells  <cit> .

while in vivo toxicity assays in animals remain the gold-standard methodology for evaluating the toxicity of a compound, the existence of a growing number of manufactured products mandates an urgent requirement for alternative assays based on high-throughput, cell-based methodologies. toxicogenomics, including in its broader scope transcriptomics and proteomics, is a promising tool not only for monitoring the toxicity of substances using human cell line assays but also for investigating and documenting the modes of action of unknown chemicals  <cit> . in this domain, lobenhofer  <cit>  developed a new concept that could potentially be a new, sensitive, and informative parameter to be systematically documented for risk assessment and comparison  <cit> . this parameter is the highest concentration of a given chemical for which no effect on the transcriptome is observed and is named the “no observed transcriptional effect level” . proteomics has, in addition, been proposed as a complementary approach to study the cellular response to toxicants  <cit> . specifically, the analysis of human cell line secretomes appears to be a promising source of biomarkers documenting their physiological state in response to chemicals  <cit> .

here, we have focused on the cellular effects induced by fumed silica nps  in a <dig> lung epithelial cells. for this, we established the transcriptomic dose–response curve over a range of silica concentrations and accurately determined the notel threshold using commercial human 4x44k gene expression microarrays. we also performed, by high-resolution shotgun proteomics, an analysis of the secretome of a <dig> cells after exposure. this new strategy allowed the highlighting, in a dose-dependent manner, of the significant cellular and molecular modifications triggered by the exposure to fumed silica nps.

RESULTS
characterization of silica nps
the silica nps were first characterized in terms of aggregation and size. in dmem/f <dig> culture medium comprising 10% fetal bovine serum , the average hydrodynamic diameter of the nps was 10 ± 4 nm, as measured by dynamic light scattering . this value is close to the value provided by the manufacturer . nps in serum-free medium were in an agglomerated form with a mean size, evaluated by dls, close to 350 nm . atomic force microscopy  showed disperse disks with diameter 10 ± 5 nm and thickness 2 ±  <dig>  nm  and confirmed the existence of size heterogeneity. figure 1b shows a typical 160 ± 90 nm agglomerate, where individual base units are clearly visible.figure  <dig> afm characterization of fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps. 5 μl of aerosil®  <dig> nps suspension  were deposited on freshly cleaved mica then dried under vacuum. afm imaging was recorded with a multimode and nanoscope v instrument . the scale of false colors spectrum code ranges from  <dig> to maximum height  using gwyddion software. a) afm imaging shows average size of individual disperse disks with diameter 10 ± 5 nm and thickness 2 nm ±  <dig>  nm. an agglomerate is observed in the upper right side. b) details of afm imaging of sio <dig> nps agglomerate in the same sample. the average size of agglomerates is 160 ± 90 nm. in the inset, a zoom of a sio <dig> agglomerate, recorded with peak force phase, reveals details of individual members clustered in the agglomerate.



viability tests and real-time cellular impedance
we evaluated the cytotoxicity of sio <dig> nps in a <dig> human alveolar epithelial cells in serum-free medium. two different toxicity assays, atp  and xtt , were carried out. these two assays comprised two different reporting systems – fluorescence and optical density, respectively – and were performed in parallel to identify potential bias due to possible interference from the nanoparticles. the atp test based on the intracellular atp content measurement is considered as a very sensitive viability test. the xtt test is based on the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme. this test was chosen to avoid the more standard mtt test. indeed, the formation of insoluble mtt formazan in this assay is often interlaced with np fibers or agglomerates, thus inhibiting its solubilization by the solvent  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  both the atp and xtt tests produced similar dose–response curves over the concentration range tested, from  <dig>  -  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> of cell surface. aerosil®  <dig> nps were cytotoxic from  <dig>  -  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  the no observed adverse effect level  for these nps was estimated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> and the lowest value for which an effect on cell viability was observed  was established at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> silica nps .figure  <dig> cell viability of a <dig> cells exposed to fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps. after 24 h exposure to silica aerosil®  <dig> nps, the viability of a <dig> cells was determined using the atp test   and the xtt test  . the results are expressed as the mean percent viable cells ± sd  compared with unexposed cells.



an xcelligence rtca instrument was used to carry out real-time cell monitoring after exposure to nps . the highest concentrations  induced a drastic decrease in cell index  compared with control cells. the lowest concentrations  indicated a biphasic ci evolution with an early increase, followed by a decrease up to the end of the experiment.figure  <dig> xcelligence experiment. real-time cell index  monitoring of a <dig> cells  exposed to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 50 μg/cm <dig> fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps for 72 h. the black arrow represents the starting point of exposure. cell index was normalized on baseline  to ensure inter-dose comparison. the highest concentrations  induced a drastic ci decrease compared to control cells. the lowest concentrations  indicated a biphasic ci evolution with an early increase followed by a decrease up to the end of the experiment.



omics-based probing of the silica np cellular effects
correlation between gene expression profiles and viability assays
gene expression changes depending on silica np concentrations were evaluated in three biological replicates with agilent human v <dig> 4x44k microarrays. figure  <dig> shows the number of differentially expressed genes detected in response to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> aerosil®  <dig> silica nps during 24 h exposure. a dose-dependent response to silica nps was observed, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  significantly differentially modulated transcripts compared with controls, with a fold change of at least  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig> . the lists of modulated transcripts including fold changes and p-values are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  these results showed a strong correlation between the numbers of modulated genes and the cell death percentage established with viability tests . from these results, the notel was set at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  with two successive concentrations  giving no significantly differentially expressed genes as the criterion . the lotel was set at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  with  <dig> transcripts as compared with controls. figure 5a shows the numbers of differentially expressed transcripts obtained with  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> silica nps, and their overlaps. a strong concordance of the results is represented by the venn diagram . at 24 h, more than 80% of the transcripts modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> were also modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  finally, the  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> doses were also analyzed with whole genome microarrays after 72 h exposure, to further identify potentially conserved adverse outcome pathways. we found  <dig> and  <dig>  modulated transcripts at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  respectively. after 72 h exposure, 88% of the transcripts modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> were also modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> figure  <dig> transcriptomic dose–response curve compared with atp assay. a <dig> cells  were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps . blue histograms represent the number of differentially expressed genes after statistical analysis with genespring software . the black curve indicates the cell death percentage obtained with the atp viability test related to the concentration of silica nanoparticles. the notel  was determined to be  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> and the lotel  as  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  the noael  was determined as  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> and the loael  at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> 



exoproteome changes upon silica np addition
to determine which secreted proteins were modulated upon silica np exposure to  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> doses at 24 h, we collected the supernatants of cell cultures from the transcriptomic experiments. this ensured that the data from both of these omics-based approaches were fully comparable. after protein extraction and trypsin proteolysis of the three biological replicates at the three conditions , the resulting peptides were analyzed by shotgun proteomics, i.e. nano-lc resolution on a reverse phase coupled to tandem mass spectrometry operated with an orbitrap mass analyzer. a total of  <dig>  ms/ms spectra were assigned with confidence to human proteins  taking the nine samples into consideration, indicating the presence of  <dig> proteins . figure 5b reports the number of significantly modulated proteins detected with this approach in the extracellular medium upon exposure to silica nps. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were significantly modulated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> at 24 h, respectively, with a fold change of at least  <dig>  . as for transcriptomics, the venn diagram showed a good correlation of the results between silica np doses, with more than 80% of the proteins that were modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> also modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> .

canonical pathway analysis
transcriptomic analysis
we identified the most relevant canonical pathways disturbed after  <dig> and 72 h exposure at all np doses using the ingenuity pathway analysis tool. each canonical pathway is constituted of a finite number of genes. for each dose and time point, we calculated a ratio indicating the percentage of altered genes in our dataset belonging to a given canonical pathway. these pathways are all significant according to a fisher statistical test .

figure  <dig> reports the seven canonical pathways mainly altered by fumed silica nps in a time- and dose-dependent manner. the most highly altered canonical pathways were related to the “coagulation system”, including “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” “prothrombin activation pathways”.figure  <dig> altered canonical pathways. a <dig> cells  were exposed for 24 h and 72 h to increasing concentrations of fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps . seven relevant canonical pathways disturbed after 24 h and 72 h exposure with two doses of nps  were revealed with the ingenuity pathway analysis tool. each canonical pathway is constituted of a finite number of genes. for each dose and time point, we calculated a ratio indicating the percentage of altered genes in our dataset belonging to a given canonical pathway. these pathways are all significant according to a fisher statistical test .



other pathways linked to the cell response, and involved at both times and both doses, included “acute phase response signaling”, “xenobiotic metabolism signaling”, “trem <dig> signaling” and “oxidative stress response”. some pathways are not represented in figure  <dig> because they were only engaged at the lowest dose . these pathways are “clathrin-mediated endocytosis”, “rho signaling pathway” and “actin cytoskeleton remodeling”; they presented low ratios but were obtained with high significance. this allowed specific cellular effects triggered as a function of increasing np concentrations to be distinguished and to be classified at three hierarchical levels of toxicological response. the additional file 3: table s <dig> indicates more precisely the genes characterizing each pathway for the three levels at all np concentrations , with their fold changes and p-values.

exoproteomic analysis
we used several tools such as signalp, secretomep, exocarta, and vesiclepedia to distinguish the proteins secreted by classical  and non-classical  export mechanisms from those that were not secreted at 24 h exposure. we then identified their implication in toxicological functions using the ipa database.

thus, at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>   <dig> proteins had a signal peptide  and were likely secreted by classical mechanisms. in addition,  <dig> proteins were found in the exocarta/vesiclepedia databases and  <dig> proteins were identified with secretomep , representing  <dig> proteins potentially secreted by non-classical mechanisms. finally, by appending all databases, it was found that 67/ <dig> proteins were secreted. remarkably, five proteins were not found with these tools and were considered as possible cellular waste with high half-lives in the extracellular compartment: histone h <dig> , t-complex protein 1e , t-complex protein 1b , tubulin b  and transitional endoplasmic reticulum atpase .

at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  eight proteins had a signal peptide  and were secreted by classical mechanisms. at this dose,  <dig> proteins were found in the exocarta/vesiclepedia databases and  <dig> proteins were identified with secretomep , representing a total of  <dig> proteins potentially secreted by non-classical mechanisms. finally, by merging all databases, it was found that 74/ <dig> proteins were actually secreted and five proteins would possibly be cellular waste: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins a2/b <dig> , transitional endoplasmic reticulum atpase , histone h <dig> , kynureninase , and tubulin beta chain .

three predominant toxicological pathways were identified with ipa. the “nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response” was triggered. among the proteins involved in the nrf <dig> response, six and seven proteins were identified at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  respectively. the “xenobiotic metabolism signaling” was also involved, with five and six proteins at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  respectively. these proteins include heat-shock proteins , detoxification enzymes such as glutathione reductase , glutathione s-transferase , lactate dehydrogenase , peroxiredoxins , thioredoxin reductase , protein disulfide isomerase , and aldo-keto reductases . all proteins were upregulated and detected with high sequence coverage .

among the non-classically secreted proteins, some, initially involved in glycolysis, were upregulated. the list includes enolase  <dig> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , aldolase a , glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , phosphoglycerate mutase  <dig> , phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , triosephosphate isomerase  <dig> , and pyruvate kinase . interestingly, only four proteins were downregulated compared to controls: thrombospondin- <dig> , transforming growth factor beta-induced , agrin , and nucleobindin  <dig> .

discussion
this work evaluated the mode of action of aerosil®  <dig> fumed amorphous silica nps in lung epithelial cells using complementary omics. we chose this cellular model because inhalation is the major route of exposure for workers in the np industry. any toxicity study with nanoparticles requires a thorough characterization of their size. we showed by atomic force microscopy  that these nps were disks with average diameter 10 ± 5 nm and thickness 2 nm ±  <dig>  nm. we also highlighted the presence of heterogeneous agglomerates  of average size 160 ± 90 nm. hydrodynamic diameters of fumed silica nps were measured by dls in the presence and absence of fetal bovine serum  in the culture medium. in the presence of fbs, these nps were dispersed, with a mean size of 10 ± 4 nm in agreement with the data from the literature  <cit>  and consistent with the data provided by the manufacturer i.e. 12 nm. in the absence of fbs, the silica nps formed agglomerates whose hydrodynamic diameter reached 350 ± 8 nm. interestingly, afm identifies the size and shape of objects whereas dls provides only their size. cell exposure was carried out in the absence of serum for two reasons: i) the exoproteome can only be assessed if contaminants from the culture medium and reagents are present in low quantities  <cit> , and ii) attempts to avoid agglomeration by artificial dispersion may lead to underestimation of possible adverse effects  <cit> . indeed, interactions between serum proteins and nanoparticles can attenuate or abrogate the potentially harmful effects of nps  <cit> .

the concept of notel
previous studies have shown that the number of modulated genes in human cells may be a good indicator of the level of cellular disturbance induced by a xenobiotic   <cit> . the concept of the notel  was described by lobenhofer et al.  <cit> . incorporating a genomic endpoint such as the notel, estimated from gene expression data, is of the highest importance in risk assessment  <cit> . we used conventional viability tests, atp and xtt , and cell impedance monitoring   as preliminary tests to determine suitable np concentrations and time points for subsequent toxicogenomic studies. with these preliminary techniques, we were thus able to frame the concentrations that were necessary and sufficient to trigger early effects on cellular mechanisms  <cit>  while avoiding excessive cellular damage. five concentrations  inducing less than 10% cell death were chosen for transcriptomic experiments. a 24 h exposure was set as the early effect test according to impedance results. the  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> doses were also analyzed in gene expression microarrays with an exposure of 72 h . the secretomes corresponding to cultures exposed to these two concentrations for 24 h were studied by tandem mass spectrometry.

we noted that the notel  was lower  than the noael identified with cytotoxicity assays , as shown in figure  <dig>  the lotel based on transcriptomics was also lower  than the loael determined from cell viability . thus, in our experiment, microarray technology may be considered to be more sensitive compared to viability tests. the notel may be a relevant indicator of biological exposure to quickly benchmark toxic doses of chemicals and mixtures, especially within the framework of large toxicology programs such as reach  <cit> .

advantages and pitfalls of omics
the data obtained with our two complementary omics approaches, transcriptomics and exoproteomics, were analyzed using the same bioinformatics tool , and the biological results were combined resulting in an illustrative example of toxicological integrative analysis. the venn diagrams showed that more than 80% of genes  and proteins  modulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> were also listed as modified at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  the two approaches are thus consistent and the results obtained at the two np doses reinforce the main toxicological findings extracted from the data. the canonical cellular pathways help to understand, in a fast and overall manner, the interactions between the modulated genes and the cellular mechanisms they belong to. the main pathways disturbed by silica nps are represented in figure  <dig>  regulation of gene expression is so finely tuned that two distinct experimental conditions can activate different transcripts , while belonging to the same pathway governing the same mode of action. thus, looking at the overall scheme rather than isolated genes allows for a better understanding of cellular mechanisms involved in the response to a toxic substance. a fortiori, analyzing the direction of regulation  of each regulated molecule seems pointless in such large eukaryotic systems, and in the state of our current knowledge. moreover, the mrnas are produced in an oscillatory manner  according to raj et al.  <cit> . their production is likely to obey finely tuned processes that we do not necessarily know. nevertheless, analyzing a direction of regulation is certainly more significant with multi-dose and multi-time analyses; potentially conserved regulations could therefore be confirmed. this is why, here, we operated microarrays at several times of exposure and doses of fumed silica nps.

regarding the analysis of proteins in the culture supernatants, comprehensive exoproteomics is tedious to perform because of the highly diluted nature of secreted proteins present in biological fluids or culture media  <cit> . consequently, we had to concentrate the supernatants by precipitation prior to their analysis with a sensitive tandem mass spectrometer. in addition, one cannot exclude the possibility that some proteins may be released in the supernatant by cell death or lysis during the cell culture. this pitfall was minimized by optimizing experimental parameters  and using specific bioinformatics tools  to distinguish the proteins that were genuinely excreted from those proteins arising from cell lysis. these secreted proteins illustrate the surroundings of the cells and how they interact with their environment.

dose-dependent hierarchical response
the hierarchical oxidative stress paradigm, first described by a. nel and colleagues  <cit> , posits that ros production leads to incremental cellular responses that can be classified as antioxidant defense, proinflammatory effects, and cytotoxicity. according to these authors, in tier  <dig>  the transcription factor nrf <dig> is activated to enhance the expression of phase ii enzymes, which attempt to restore redox equilibrium. if the level of oxidant injury increases , cells express proinflammatory cytokines by activating signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase  and nuclear factor-kappa b  cascades. at the highest level of oxidative stress , interference in mitochondrial inner membrane electron transfer or changing the open/closed status of the permeability transition pore could lead to effects on atp synthesis and the release of proapoptotic factors.

in this study, we illustrated this paradigm to demonstrate that increasingly severe cellular dysfunctions were triggered by silica nps in a dose-dependent manner . moreover, our data show cellular mechanisms that occur at lower doses than those that activate oxidative stress.figure  <dig> hierarchical stress response following exposure to increasing concentration of aerosil®  <dig> fumed amorphous silica nps. a <dig> cells  were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  the silica nps activated rho signaling pathways and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. from  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  proinflammatory effectors were activated and the “coagulation system pathway” was triggered. beyond  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  the pathways of “xenobiotic metabolism” and “acute phase response” were activated. the vertical scale represents the percentage of dead cells, as determined by atp assays, in relation to the tested doses of silica nps. these data exemplify the paradigm of dose dependent toxic events developed by meng et al.  <cit> . this figure is freely adapted from their scheme with permission from meng et al.  <cit> , american chemical society, although the quantitative data and pathways are those obtained in experiments described in the current article.



no effect 
as depicted in figure  <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg fumed silica nps per cm <dig> cell surface, no effect was detected by transcriptomics. the notel point, the highest concentration of nps giving no transcriptional effect, was set to  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  as two successive values gave no effect.

internalization, externalization 
at a very low dose of fumed silica nps , we observed an intense signaling activity . here, we highlighted five induced transcripts belonging to the pathway “clathrin-mediated endocytosis” . this pathway is the major pathway for the internalization of exogenous molecules from the plasma membrane into intracellular compartments. we also observed the induction of downstream effectors of the “rho signaling pathway” . rho signaling attests to a cytoskeleton reorganization by stimulating actin dynamics. rho gtpases regulate membrane trafficking and are important regulators of exocytosis through a process not yet elucidated  <cit> .

we did not observe, among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed at this concentration, any element of antioxidant response. typically, in our first level, we describe some events that are well below the events described by nel and colleagues in their tier  <dig>  i.e. oxidative stress  <cit> . a possible reason may be that antioxidant defense has been shown to be triggered by a higher concentration   <cit> , and another explanation is that our technology is extremely sensitive in apprehending very subtle events. in our data, the first level rather reflects the endocytosis and exocytosis of nps, as attested by the cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane trafficking. this likely corresponds to a normal response of cellular defense.

inflammation and nonspecific response 
starting from the  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> dose, upregulation of inflammatory mediators  and chemokines  was observed in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h exposure . these results are consistent with those found in the literature for silica and other nps  <cit> . perkins et al. previously compared crystalline and amorphous silica nps, but found that only cristobalite upregulated il <dig> and il <dig> in lung beas- 2b cells whereas amorphous silica nps only modulated ccl <dig>  expression  <cit> . here, we observed that not only the above interleukins, but also ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  were upregulated in the presence of aerosil®  <dig> fumed silica nps, with a fold change of  <dig>  and  <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  respectively. this discrepancy between our data and previously published data illustrates the possible heterogeneity of the results in the np literature, probably directly linked to the different nature of the nps. in particular, fumed aerosil®  <dig> nps differ from the amorphous silica nps of the previous study  <cit> , with a surface area  <dig> times greater. the “trem <dig> signaling pathway” was triggered, leading to proinflammatory immune responses. the trem <dig> transcript, which belongs to the immunoglobulin family of cell surface receptors, was upregulated at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> 

coagulation system perturbation as a specific response 
at higher concentrations , and for two exposure durations , the canonical “coagulation pathway” was altered by fumed silica nps . this pathway, and more specifically the “intrinsic and extrinsic prothrombin activation” subgroups, is the most significant altered pathway. besides the known functions of the alveolar epithelium, such as surfactant secretion , gas exchange, and ion transport, these cells also have barrier properties that protect against the passage of air pollutants into the circulation  <cit> . these authors also demonstrated that in a <dig> cells, the coagulation process responds to injury by the rapid formation of a clot and fibrin deposition  <cit> .

our data thus suggest that this pathway is a direct consequence of the alteration of the a <dig> cell monolayer by fumed silica nanoparticles, probably due to cell membrane alteration. indeed, as demonstrated by zhang and colleagues, fumed silica nps  induce a dramatically higher cytotoxicity than colloidal silica in lung cells beas-2b  <cit> . the authors explained the increased toxicity of fumed silica by its thermally promoted surface properties, i.e. the formation of strained, three-membered siloxane rings on the silica surface via dehydroxylation. these rings are rapidly hydrolyzed upon rehydration in culture medium, exposing hydroxyl groups responsible for cell toxicity by interaction with cell membranes. in our proteomic data, the cell membrane alteration is confirmed by the release of the ldh protein, which is an indicator of cell membrane integrity.

coagulation is a complex process that can be initiated via the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. in the extrinsic pathway, a cascade of activation including factor viia  and tissue factor  leads to the generation of thrombin  and the production of fibrin , which creates a clot. in the intrinsic pathway, a cascade of activations leads to the production of coagulation factors such as fxa . the coagulation system includes a number of control proteins to maintain a fine balance between formation and dissolution of the clot. plasmin is one of these proteins that are required for dissolution of the fibrin clot. plasmin is activated by tissue plasminogen activator  and urokinase . protein c, protein s, and thrombomodulin together degrade fva and fviiia.

the modifications of expression of the key actors in the coagulation process are given in additional file 3: table s <dig>  f <dig> , f <dig>  f <dig> and f13b are downregulated, as are fga, fgb and fgg , and klk <dig> . thbd  is upregulated, likely reducing coagulation and activating the anticoagulant pathway. proc, pros <dig>  and tfp <dig>  are also differentially expressed in our datasets. in addition, plat , plau , and plaur are upregulated. these participate in the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, thus activating fibrinolysis to dissolve fibrin clots.

although the interpretation of the direction of the regulation  of each individual molecular component of a pathway is far from being straightforward in such a complex system, it is interesting to note that key molecules of the coagulation system have a conserved modulation with both dose and time of exposure. the modifications in expression of the main transcripts of the coagulation system were confirmed by qrt-pcr .figure  <dig> changes in the mrna expression measured by transcriptome and by real-time pcr. the fold changes of fga, f <dig>  plau, fgg, f <dig>  and proc in cells treated with fumed silica aerosil®  <dig> nps  are expressed versus untreated cells. for qrt-pcr  normalization was based on the total rna mass quantified on the nanodrop. all expressions in treated cells were significantly different from controls at p <  <dig> . these genes are all connected to the “coagulation pathway” and the qrt-pcr findings confirm transcriptomic data.



hence it is difficult to determine if these genes activate wound healing by fibrinogenesis or if, on the contrary, they destroy fibrin clots by fibrinolysis. it is likely that both mechanisms are at work, as the coagulation system responds to injury through a cascade of events leading to the formation of a clot that is eventually degraded and resorbed through the process of fibrinolysis. it is possible that, at 24 h and 72 h after exposure, only the final stage of the process is detectable. proteomics revealed the inhibition of thrombospondin  which participates in the plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis  <cit> .

according to napierska et al., inhaled particles are involved in a procoagulant response in lung models  <cit> . available data from experimental instillation/inhalation of engineered nanoparticles are supportive of the hypothesis that a pulmonary and/or systemic inflammatory response induces a procoagulatory state  <cit> . therefore, in coherence with the literature, our data support an effect of these silica nanoparticles on the coagulation system, and argue for the involvement of this specific mechanism starting at level  <dig> 

toxic oxidative stress 
at the  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> dose, we observed by transcriptomics the first signs of oxidative stress , caused by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and the detoxification of reactive intermediates, especially the nrf <dig> signaling cascade, antioxidant molecules , and phase i and phase ii enzymes . proteomics clearly indicated the presence of the “nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response”, with the induction of the enzymes, prdx <dig> and txnrd <dig> 

our transcriptomics results highlighted the “acute phase response signaling” pathway, a nonspecific defense mechanism. this pathway is triggered by tissue injury and characterized by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins such as nfkb <dig>  il <dig>  and sod <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  “xenobiotic metabolism signaling” is also activated, with several transcripts encoding enzymes such as aldha, map2k <dig>  and tnf at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  proteomics confirmed this trend with the overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase aldha , glutathione transferase gstp <dig> , and heat-shock protein hsp90a , at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  respectively.

toxicogenomics and risk assessment
the hierarchical response of alveolar epithelial lung cells  illustrates quantitatively the perspectives developed by a. nel and colleagues  <cit>  regarding the safety assessment of nanomaterials.

the genome-wide response to nanomaterial exposure remains largely unexplored and the use of omics technologies in the safety assessment of nanomaterials would be interesting for predictive toxicology  <cit> . we have demonstrated that toxicogenomics can provide a quantitative assessment of toxicity and, at the same time, gives information about the mode of action of toxicants, possibly revealing adverse outcome pathways . in their vision and strategy for toxicity testing in the 21st century, the national research council cited the linkage of adverse effects to specific toxicity pathways and “applications of toxicogenomic technologies to predictive toxicology and risk assessment”. recently, efsa delivered a scientific report recommending for future work and research the use of omics technologies and aops in the context of the prioritization of chemicals for risk assessment  <cit> .

in our study, the use of these two techniques allowed us to establish a precise dose–response curve of fumed silica nps, with a notel, and to link these doses to specific pathways, allowing insights into mechanistic information for both intracellular and extracellular compartments.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were combined in the current study to investigate quantitatively the effects of aerosil®  <dig> fumed silica nps in a <dig> epithelial lung cells, and within their close environment to decipher their mode of action. such an alliance of omics has rarely been reported regarding the toxicological effects of nps. our main findings allowed the setting of a notel  for fumed silica nps at  <dig>  μg/cm <dig>  a threshold lower than values previously obtained with conventional viability tests. moreover, the notel may be a relevant indicator of biological exposure for use in quickly benchmarking doses of chemicals and mixtures in toxicology.

these techniques allowed us to establish a hierarchical dose–response curve of fumed silica nps, linking doses to adverse outcome pathways, and delivering not only quantified cytotoxic values but also mechanistic information for both the intracellular and extracellular compartments. monitoring the overall effects rather than those of isolated genes/proteins thus allows for a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in the response to a toxic substance, without losing the possibility to analyze very specific molecular effects. as in photography, toxicogenomics allows, at the same time, the acquisition of a wide vision of biological responses and a “zoom” into the details with a great depth of field. indeed the hypotheses generated by these results regarding a specific adverse effect can be studied further with more focused techniques. this approach might be adapted to any type of potentially toxic substance, alone or in a mixture, in cellular models as a predictive tool for toxicity assessment in a future regulatory perspective.
