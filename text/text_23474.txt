BACKGROUND
during the last decades consumers have started demanding animal products of low fat and high polyunsaturated fatty acids content, while maintaining high and consistent quality  <cit> . to that purpose, research has been conducted on ruminant’s adipogenesis and lipogenesis in order to improve both the production efficiency and beef quality. adipose tissue is involved in the regulation of body homeostasis, particularly in energy metabolism, storage and expenditure. in cattle, fatty acid type and amount in muscles are directly associated with meat quality and its value. in fact, subcutaneous and intramuscular adipose tissues are the most important fat depots concerning meat quality traits. it is desirable that cattle carcasses have minimal amounts of fat stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue , without a detrimental decrease in intramuscular fat  <cit> . this can be achieved only if the regulation of lipid deposition in intramuscular and other fat depots differs substantially. despite being the main site for de novo fatty acid and triacylglycerols  synthesis in ruminants  <cit> , the sat is also the most energetically inefficient fat depot and, therefore, considered an economic loss. however, while during the last decade knowledge of rodents and human fat physiology has progressed rapidly  <cit> , the same information regarding ruminant species is very limited.

the expression level of adipogenic and lipogenic genes in adipose tissues is regulated by a number of transcription factors  <cit> , whose differential expression is known to play a key role in lipid metabolism of cattle adipocytes  <cit> . adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis occur through the interaction of endogenous genetic mechanisms , external controls , as well as local interactions within cells in a fat depot  <cit> . despite the intricacies of lipogenesis and lipolysis, the role of some genes has been elucidated and confirmed to be related to fatty acid composition in cattle  <cit> . potential regulatory mechanisms involved in the fatty acid deposition are lipogenic  and oxidative  genes, as well as transcription regulators . these genes have been described  <cit>  for their roles and expression patterns during adipocyte differentiation, namely in studies comparing the regulation of adipose tissue deposition in distinct cattle breeds  <cit> .

genetic factors underlying both the deposition and the turnover of individual fatty acids are not fully understood, although breed has been found to influence beef fatty acid composition  <cit> . fatty acid composition in meat-producing animals is recognised to have implications on the nutritional and organoleptic properties of meat, as well as in its technological quality  <cit> . ruminant products can be an additional source of the beneficial long-chain n- <dig> pufa  for human diets  <cit>  when the consumption of n- <dig> pufa-rich foods, such as fish, is low. in addition, ruminant meats are major dietary sources of dpa . thus, genetic selection and breeding of animals with a desirable meat fatty composition may provide a source of beneficial fatty acids for human consumption  <cit> . comparative differences of beef cattle present a unique resource to study several aspects of lipid metabolism. in addition to genetic factors, finishing systems can dramatically alter fat deposition  <cit> , thus indicating that lipogenic activity is influenced by the dietary energy level, the energy source and, possibly, the forage to concentrate ratio. however, fatty acid composition in ruminant animals, unlike in monogastrics, is much less dependent on the diet, as a consequence of dietary fatty acid metabolism  within the rumen  <cit> .

the biochemical processes and the molecular background affecting genetic variability of the complex trait of fat content and fatty acid composition are not yet fully understood, particularly with regard to european cattle breeds, because most of the recent studies have been performed on the specific genetic background of japanese black cattle  <cit> . therefore, we conducted a trial with bulls from two portuguese genetically diverse breeds  <cit>  with distinct maturity rates, alentejana and barrosã, fed high or low silage diets. the working hypothesis of the present paper was that the expression of key genes controlling lipid metabolism during the finishing phase of cattle is breed-specific  and diet-modulated . furthermore, given the distinct roles of subcutaneous and intramuscular fat depots in cattle lipid metabolism, the tissue-specific variations were also investigated through the analysis of both sat and muscle gene expression patterns. finally, the breed-, diet- and tissue-specific relationships among the expression level of these genes and fat content and composition were also assessed.

RESULTS

total lipid content and percentages of main fatty acids  in the sat from the four experimental groups are presented in table  <dig>  the content of total lipids was higher  in the sat of barrosã breed when compared to alentejana bulls. barrosã bulls had lower 14: <dig> , 16: <dig>  and 18: <dig>  fatty acid proportions in the sat than the alentejana bulls. breed also determined the proportions of 16:1c <dig>  a-17: <dig>  18:1t <dig>  18:1c <dig> and 18:2c9t11-cla fatty acids in the sat, with the barrosã breed having higher values when compared to the alentejana bulls . trans fatty acids  were higher in barrosã than in alentejana bulls . diet influenced the proportions of a-17: <dig> and 18: <dig> , with the high silage fed bulls presenting the highest values. animals fed the low silage diet had the highest proportions of tfa . the branched chain fatty acids , which are closely related to the rumen activity, were higher in animals fed the high silage diets . a breed × diet interaction was found for the fatty acid 18:2n- <dig> , with the alentejana bulls fed the low silage diet presenting the highest proportion. while alentejana bulls had higher proportions of saturated  but lower monounsaturated fatty acids  percentages, the inverse pattern was observed in the barrosã bulls . both total pufa and n- <dig> pufa percentages were higher in the alentejana bulls fed the low silage diet, whereas in the sat from barrosã bulls no variation between diets was observed . the percentages of n- <dig> pufa were the highest in the sat from barrosã bulls fed the high silage diet .

for sat, the correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between total lipid content and fabp <dig> gene expression level . in addition, this analysis showed negative correlations between this gene and 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> fatty acids . furthermore, positive correlations were found for fabp <dig> expression level and 18:1c <dig> , 18:1c <dig>  and c <dig> t11-cla , as well as for sfa  and mufa . lpl gene expression had a negative association with 14: <dig>  and 16: <dig> , as well as the sfa . in addition, positive correlations were found between lpl mrna expression levels and total lipids , 18:1c <dig>  and c <dig> t11-cla , as well as with mufa . the scd gene expression and the proportions of both 18:1c <dig> and c <dig> t11-cla were positively correlated . a moderate association was also observed between scd gene expression and mufa . in addition, there was a negative correlation between 16: <dig> and expression of the scd gene . concomitantly, sfa and scd gene expression were also negatively correlated .

concerning the muscle, acaca expression levels were correlated with total lipids , and the percentages of tfa . correlations were also found between fabp <dig> mrna levels and total lipids , 18:1c <dig> , and mufa . the mrna levels for ppara gene were negatively related to 18:1c <dig>  percentages. levels of pparg expressionwere associated with the percentages of 14: <dig> . a positive association was found for scd mrna levels and tfa . finally, 18:1c <dig> and tfa showed positive correlations  with the expression levels of the srebf <dig> gene.

principal components analysis
a principal components analysis  was applied to a data set of fatty acid composition and gene expression parameters in order to describe the variability of the pooled data into two dimensions . the score plot of the first two components explains  <dig> % of the total variability, with  <dig> % for pc <dig> and  <dig> % for pc <dig> . in the score plot, there is a clear separation of most genes from the main fatty acids, except 18:1c <dig> and cla . most of the genes were allocated on the right side of the plot , clearly separated from the other variables, showing positive scores for the pc <dig> and little influence on the pc <dig>  in contrast, the cpt <dig> gene was located on quadrant a, with positive scores for pc <dig>

the pc <dig>  which explains 57% of the variability, separated tissues , with lipogenic genes and total lipids associated with sat metabolism . the pc <dig>  which explains 13% of the variability, separated palmitic  and myristic  fatty acids  from the remaining fatty acids. in quadrant b, a cluster was defined by acaca, crat, lpl, scd, srebf <dig> and ppara genes. in addition, a cluster was formed by cla, oleic acid  and the fabp <dig> gene. the score plot depicted in figure 3b shows the location of the ll muscle and sat samples in the multivariate space of the first two pcs. these scores were clearly arranged in two clusters, corresponding to each tissue. in addition, for sat there was some degree of separation between alentejana  and barrosã bulls , whereas for muscle the distinction between experimental groups was not so clear.

discussion
the deposition of fat and fatty acids in animal tissues has been ascribed to a complex regulation network of lipogenic genes, although the molecular mechanisms underlying these systems remain to be established. considering that adipose tissue physiology is related to both meat quality and animal production efficiency, understanding the factors affecting the depot-specific fat accretion and metabolism in beef cattle is of paramount importance. the present study addressed these aspects based on an experimental trial with two genetically diverse bovine breeds with distinct maturity rates, alentejana and barrosã, fed diets with different silage to concentrate ratios . albeit phylogenetically distant  <cit> , alentejana and barrosã breeds are, nevertheless, more genetically similar than the breeds used in previous studies addressing adipogenic gene expression differences, mainly based on the japanese black genotype  <cit> . nonetheless, results reported here indicate that genetic background and, to a lesser extent diet composition, determine fat content and composition, pointing out to a differential fat partitioning between subcutaneous and intramuscular fat in alentejana and barrosã breeds.

in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this physiological process, these breed- and diet-specific variations are explained here through the transcript levels of nine key lipid metabolism-related genes. the pca showed a close relationship among all adipogenic and lipogenic genes, which separated distinctively from cpt <dig> gene, involved in the β-oxidation pathway, but not crat. pparg is a key activator of adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity  <cit> , inducing the transcription of many adipocyte genes encoding proteins and enzymes involved in the development and the maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype  <cit> . surprisingly, levels of expression of pparg were kept unchanged among experimental groups in the sat samples, although barrosã breed tended to have higher expression levels in the muscle than alentejana bulls. it was expected that barrosã breed, being a precocious breed, would had a greater proportion of adipocytes undergoing differentiation and, therefore, would had a greater relative expression of pparg than alentejana bulls. although pparg expression peaks during adipocyte differentiation, it is also expressed in mature adipocytes, but at lower levels  <cit> . harper and pethick  <cit>  reported that the expression of pparg decreases substantially as growth proceeds. therefore, treatment differences may not have been detected if one group had adipocytes undergoing differentiation, whereas the other group may have greater number of mature adipocytes resulting in similar pparg expression levels. differences could, however, be detected at earlier stages of development. these results can be explained by the circumstance that subcutaneous fat develops earlier than intramuscular fat and, therefore, the tendency observed in the muscle was not detected in the sat.

the srebf <dig> gene encodes a transcription factor involved in adipocyte differentiation  <cit>  and in the biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit>  being, possibly, implicated in a mechanism that links adipogenesis and lipogenesis. in particular, the srebf1c isoform appears to be primarily involved in regulating the expression of lipogenic and fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes. the transcription and activation of srebf1c protein was proposed to be regulated by the degree of saturation of lipids  <cit> . graugnard et al.  <cit>  suggested that the expression of the srebf <dig> gene could be nutritionally regulated. transcriptional regulation of srebf <dig> in most non-ruminant animals is sensitive to insulin, which under times of carbohydrate excess leads to stimulation of fatty acid synthesis and tag deposition in adipose tissue  <cit> . in the present study, insulin levels were also the highest in low silage fed bulls  <cit> , as were the expression levels of srebf <dig> in the sat. although the transcription factor srebf <dig> is considered to regulate scd expression  <cit> , its expression levels were not consistent with that of scd in the muscle.

as pre-adipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes, lpl is one of the first genes expressed due to its role in the de novo fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . a higher relative lpl mrna expression in the sat could indicate that barrosã bulls had more adipocytes undergoing differentiation when compared to alentejana bulls. pickworth et al.  <cit>  proposed that lpl may be a more definitive indicator of adipocyte differentiation than pparg. concerning the relationships between the fatty acids and lpl expression in sat, the correlation analysis revealed close relationships between levels of lpl mrna and 18:1c <dig>  as well as c <dig> t11-cla, among others. these results highlight the role of lpl in the control of tag uptake and, consequently, on the fatty acid profile. however, the same pattern was not observed for the muscle and lpl showed no clear association with the main fatty acids. taking into account that both scd and lpl are expressed late in adipogenesis, increased gene expression would be consistent with more active adipocytes in sat from barrosã than in alentejana bulls. taken together, these results suggest that barrosã bulls may have more differentiated adipocytes, which are capable of storing fat in the subcutaneous depot.

fabp <dig> protein is responsible for the transport of fatty acid outside the cell  <cit>  and plays a role in lipolysis and fatty acid trafficking in different tissues  <cit> . fat storage and metabolism within functional adipocytes are modulated by fabp <dig>  <cit> , and thus levels of expression of this gene can be used as a marker of fully differentiated adipocytes  <cit> . in fact, its association with intramuscular fat content and backfat thickness have been reported by jurie et al.  <cit> . results herein presented for fabp <dig> expression are concomitant with a higher fatty acids deposition in the sat from barrosã when compared to alentejana bulls. the higher expression levels of fabp <dig> in barrosã bulls fed the low silage diet may be indicative of a higher level of adipogenic differentiation in the sat of these animals. several studies reported an association between bovine fabp <dig> gene expression or protein activity and intramuscular fat content  <cit> , as well as backfat depth  <cit> . accordingly, in this study, the barrosã carcasses had the highest intramuscular fat and carcass fatness scores . furthermore, levels of fabp <dig> expression were moderately associated with total lipids contents in the muscle, as well as with the 18:1c <dig> proportions and the associated desaturation index. on the other hand, fabp <dig> was associated with the main fatty acids in the sat. these results reinforce the role of fabp <dig> in intramuscular fat development and the sat as the major site for lipid metabolism in ruminants.

acaca is a key regulator of lipogenesis and the rate-controlling enzyme in adipose tissue of meat-producing animals  <cit> . the expression of the acaca gene is highly inducible in the major lipogenic tissues  <cit>  and the enzyme is nutritionally regulated  <cit> . in a study by joseph et al.  <cit> , it was found that oleic acid had an inhibitory effect on the expression of lipogenic genes in the sat. in line with this, data herein presented revealed that, in sat, acaca expression levels tended to be the highest in barrosã bulls fed the low silage diet . however, in the muscle, the expression levels tended to be lower in the high silage fed animals. these results suggested that the effect of dietary fatty acid composition is not only influenced by the genetic background but also by the fat depot location. in addition, acaca mrna levels were shown to have a positive association with total lipid content in the muscle samples, thus adding evidence to the importance of this enzyme to intramuscular fat deposition in ruminants.

dietary n- <dig> and n- <dig> pufa have been shown to inhibit de novo lipogenesis in dairy cattle  <cit> . accordingly, our results showed a tendency for higher acaca expression levels in the muscle from the low silage- in comparison to the high silage-fed bulls. underwood et al.  <cit>  reported a positive relationship between acaca enzyme activity and intramuscular fat, which is consistent with our findings. in the present study, total lipids in the muscle were positively related to the expression of acaca. although this gene codifies for an enzyme which catalyses the formation of sfa, there was a positive association between acaca expression levels and tfa. this suggests that an increase in tfa biosynthesis, that is, in desaturase activity, is a major factor in intramuscular  deposition in ruminants. in addition, cpt1b tended to show lower expression levels in the muscle from alentejana, indicating higher fatty acid oxidation in the barrosã breed.

results concerning scd gene expression, considered a marker of mature adipocytes  <cit> , support the concept of a higher degree of maturity of the sat adipocytes from the barrosã than the alentejana bulls, as observed for the fabp <dig> gene. the fatty acid composition of sat mirrors the action of the scd protein on substrates like stearic and palmitic acids. the correlation analysis between oleic acid proportions and scd expression levels in the sat was showed to be positive and significant. this result is in agreement with previous reports  <cit>  that reported that increased scd activity is, at least partially, responsible for an elevated oleic acid, the main mufa, content in ruminant. similarly, a significant correlation was also found between c <dig> t11-cla percentage and scd expression levels. taniguchi et al.  <cit>  reported a positive correlation between levels of scd mrna and mufa proportion, which led to the conclusion that scd expression might contribute to the differences in the sat fatty acid composition between breeds. the variations observed in the fatty acid classes in the sat and muscle samples were mostly due to breed. high mufa proportions in sat have been reported  <cit>  and might be related to an elevated scd activity. overall, our results support the concept of a central role for scd in adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis. genes encoding lipogenic enzymes responsible for the de novo sfa synthesis and mufa production were down-regulated in alentejana breed when compared to barrosã bulls. this is in agreement with changes in tissue fatty acid composition, in which 16: <dig> concentration, the end product of de novo sfa synthesis, and c <dig> t11-cla, a product of delta- <dig> desaturation, were reduced in the sat of alentejana bulls when compared to that of barrosã animals.

in contrast to what was observed in sat, the expression levels of the scd gene in the muscle were similar among the four experimental groups. several authors reported that scd mrna  <cit>  or protein expression levels  <cit>  in muscle do not reflect intramuscular fat levels. the results herein reported are consistent with those of the previous studies. in addition, an association between scd mrna levels and mufa contents in bovine sat has been reported in several works  <cit> . nonetheless, the same association has not been reported for muscle  <cit> , which could point to a depot-specific regulation mechanism of scd gene expression and/or enzyme activity. finally, it should also be noted that there was a high individual variation in the scd mrna levels. therefore, despite changes in relative gene expression mirroring the changes in mufa proportion, the correlation analysis failed to establish a significant association between both. the lack of association between c <dig> t11-cla and scd expression is in agreement with data reported by both ward et al.  <cit>  and bartoň et al.  <cit> . positive correlations, however, were found between the levels of scd gene expression and total lipids, as well as tfa, both of which increase as fattening proceeds  <cit> . it should however be taken into account that conclusions drawn from single-point observations may lead to the erroneous assumption that scd was not affected and/or had a crucial role in intramuscular fat synthesis. in that regard, graugnard et al.  <cit>  suggested that responses to high starch diets might not necessarily lead to increased adipogenesis. moreover, these authors reported with some surprise that animals fed a low starch/high fibre diet during the growing phase showed increases in expression of lipogenic genes pparg, fabp <dig>  and scd during the finishing phase.

the ppara gene induces the expression of the fatty acid β-oxidation genes  <cit> . the tendency for a higher expression of ppara in the sat from barrosã bulls fed the low silage diet in comparison to the remaining experimental groups is concomitant with a more intense β-oxidation in the former breed. in addition, ppara has been shown to induce the expression of delta- <dig> and delta- <dig> desaturase genes  <cit> . however, results from the present study revealed no clear association between the ppara mrna levels and the fatty acid composition of sat.

carnitine acyltransferases catalyse the exchange of acyl groups between carnitine and coenzyme a   <cit> . these enzymes include crat and carnitine palmitoyltransferases   <cit> . the cpts transesterify medium and long chain fatty acyl chains, whereas crat transesterifies short-chain acyl chains  <cit> . high crat gene transcription levels may be indicative of an elevated number of differentiating cells during growth  <cit> . the higher crat transcription levels found in the barrosã bulls are in agreement with the higher lipid accumulation in the barrosã sat, in comparison to the alentejana bulls. in contrast, the lack of a significant variation in their relative expression levels of both genes’ in muscle samples is in agreement with the similar expression levels observed for the genes indicative of terminal adipocyte differentiation . in addition, the close association between crat and the genes involved in lipogenesis reinforces the relationship between lipogenesis and β-oxidation, thus being indicative of high lipid turnover in those animals with high lipid deposition.

if in sat there was a clear effect of breed in fatty acid deposition, with no influence of diet composition, in the ll muscle the response to dietary silage levels depended on animals’ genetic background. in previous studies  <cit> , diets differing in starch contents , which is also the case of the present study, resulted in higher intramuscular fat in animals fed high starch diets. the interaction between breed and diet found suggests that the concept that high concentrate diets increase beef intramuscular  <cit>  may be determined by breed and/or maturity. the differential response to diet composition between alentejana and barrosã bulls suggests distinct ruminal biohydrogenation patterns, as indicated by the intramuscular fatty acids contents, as well as the increased 18:2n- <dig> metabolic availability in alentejana bulls fed the low silage diet. a differential regulation of fatty acid metabolism in distinct fat depots could explain the fact that no similar response was observed in sat. indeed, various fat depots have been reported to differ markedly in lipogenic activity  <cit> . an increase in the sfa content is to be expected whenever the concentrate proportion in the diet is increased. feed silage level had no effect on total sfa of both tissues. however, in the sat stearic acid was higher in high silage than in low silage fed bulls, and also higher in alentejana when compared to barrosã breed, but no such effects were found in the ll muscle. similarly, both total and individual mufa were not responsive to dietary silage level in the sat, whereas in the ll muscle a tendency was found for the low silage diet to promote higher percentages of these fatty acids. both pufa and tfa were influenced by breed and diet, but the response to breed and diet factors differed between tissues. the bcfa were the only fatty acids showing similar response to diet, given that they originate ruminal activity and suffer no further modifications until being deposited in tissues. taken together, these results suggest a differential regulation of fatty acid metabolism between tissues, possibly resulting from the contrasting roles of intramuscular and subcutaneous fat depots. in addition, the data also indicate differences in genetic background reflected in the response to diet composition, both in the gene expression of adipogenic and lipogenic factors and fatty acid composition of tissues.

the pca confirmed the tissues contrasting features regarding lipid metabolism and fatty acid composition, showing a clear separation between the muscle and the sat, as was previously shown by the analysis of variance. in addition, this statistical approach showed that there is less variability in muscle fatty acid composition and gene expression when compared to the sat, as depicted by the plot of component scores. furthermore, the pca indicates that the expression levels of most adipogenic and lipogenic genes, along with linoleic acid, are the variables with the most discriminant power between tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
the results herein presented suggest that, at  <dig> months old, barrosã bulls might have more differentiated adipocytes and lipids deposited in sat than alentejana animals. moreover, both lipogenesis  and β-oxidation  related genes had higher levels of mrna in the sat from barrosã animals when compared to alentejana bulls. these data indicate a higher storage/removal ratio of tag and a greater dynamics of lipid turnover in the sat of barrosã breed relative to alentejana bulls.

the fatty acid deposition in the sat is mainly influenced by dietary silage level, whereas the effect of breed is mostly associated with the expression level of the transcription factor srebf <dig>  combined effects of breed and diet were obtained for the de novo fatty acid synthesis  and fatty acid transport in adipocytes  related genes, and the transcription factor ppara mrna levels.

in contrast to sat, only a slight breed effect was obtained for muscle, with the expression levels of pparg and cpt1b showing a tendency to be higher in barrosã bulls. however, the low silage diet, relative to the high silage diet, increased the levels of fabp <dig> and acaca mrna and tended to decrease lpl expression in the muscle.

taken together, the results herein presented show that lipid metabolism in sat is more sensitive to breed than muscle, whereas lipid metabolism in the latter tissue appears to be mostly diet-dependent. the differential gene expression patterns in sat and muscle are likely responsible for the fatty acid partitioning between both tissues, thus reinforcing the prevailing role of sat over intramuscular fat in the de novo fatty acid synthesis. these findings provide evidence for breed- and tissue-specific variations in fatty acid content and composition of beef cattle, which can be explained, at least in part, by the expression of key adipogenic and lipogenic genes involved in lipid metabolism. this insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying fat deposition in bovine sat and muscle in different breed may contribute to the development of diet-based strategies to improve competitiveness of beef industry in order to satisfy consumers’ expectations.
