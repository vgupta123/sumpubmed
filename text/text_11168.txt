BACKGROUND
receptor-like/pelle kinases  are important components in the regulation of plant development, hormone signalling, abiotic, and biotic stress responses in plants. rlks are serine-threonine protein kinases that typically contain a signal peptide, a variable extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a conserved intracellular protein kinase domain. the extracellular ligand-binding domain perceives signals and is commonly used to classify rlks into distinct subgroups  <cit> . the rlks are one of the largest gene families in arabidopsis with more than  <dig> members,  <cit> , but only relatively few of them, mostly leucine-rich repeat rlks , have been functionally characterized. clavata <dig>  a lrr-rlk, binds the small extracellular protein clavata <dig> to regulate meristem proliferation  <cit> . feronia  is central to the regulation of male-female interactions during pollen tube reception in arabidopsis  <cit>  and in brassica the s-locus receptor kinase and its ligand are critical determinants of self-incompatibility  <cit> . in arabidopsis, erecta  is a multifaceted regulator of development and physiological processes as well as environmental responses  <cit> . brassinosteroid insensitive  <dig>  binds the plant hormone brassinosteroid and dimerizes with bri1-associated receptor kinase 1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  <dig>   <cit> . bak <dig> also inducibly dimerizes with the rlk flagellin sensitive  <dig> , which recognizes bacterial flagellin and is important in plant immunity  <cit> . other rlks contributing to pathogen recognition include efr  and rice xa <dig> , which recognizes a sulfonated peptide produced by the pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> .

the duf <dig>  rlks, also known as cysteine-rich rlks , form a large subgroup of the rlk family with more than  <dig> members  <cit> . the extracellular region of the protein contains two copies of the duf <dig> domain which has four conserved cysteines  that may form disulphide bridges as potential targets for thiol redox regulation. the crks are transcriptionally induced by oxidative stress, pathogen attack and application of salicylic acid   <cit> . accordingly several members of the crk subgroup of rlks are involved in the regulation defence reactions and cell death in arabidopsis leaves. constitutive over-expression of crk <dig> led to increased resistance to the virulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> but also to enhanced growth of the plant leaves  <cit> . over-expression of crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig> and crk <dig> by a chemically inducible promoter, on the other hand, caused cell death  <cit> . genetic analysis suggested that crk <dig> regulated cell death independently of sa  <cit> . conversely the enhanced resistance to pseudomonas upon overexpression of crk <dig> required increased sa levels  <cit> .

reactive oxygen species  have been established as important signalling molecules for inter- and intracellular communication in plants, animals and yeast  <cit> . ros are produced in strictly defined locations in reponse to specific stimuli  <cit> . pathogen infection rapidly induces an extracellular oxidative burst while light stress and specific chemicals, including paraquat and norflurazon, induce ros production in the chloroplast  <cit> . plant cells can differentiate between the type and localization of ros resulting in very specific responses. furthermore, ros production in specific cellular compartments can have impact on ros generation and signalling in other locations  <cit> . this crosstalk is likely accomplished through interplay between separate signalling pathways rather than direct interaction of the ros molecules themselves  <cit> . however, the molecular components and mechanisms involved are still poorly defined  <cit> . in addition, it is unknown how ros are sensed and how specificity in ros signalling is achieved. the gaseous molecule ozone  induces a burst of ros in the apoplast similar to the oxidative burst in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . other similarities between o <dig> and pathogen infection include the production of sa and ethylene   <cit> . o <dig> is a convenient system to experimentally address the effects of apoplastic ros since the plant is not exposed to other effector proteins or toxins which might induce defence responses. o <dig> permits the study of the apoplastic oxidative burst undisturbed by manual manipulation of the plant material.

plant hormones are a group of unrelated small compounds which are central to signalling during environmental adaptation and developmental regulation  <cit> . sa, jasmonic acid  and et are viewed as the main hormonal determinants of plant pathogen defence  <cit> . abscisic acid  modulates plant defence and is a negative regulator of sa responses  <cit> . in addition, aba is a key regulator of the high light response  <cit> . the interaction of hormone and ros signalling is well documented. ros can induce cell death in a sa-dependent and independent manner  <cit> . cell death and ros induce et synthesis, which feeds into a positive forward amplification loop enhancing ros production  <cit> . ros-induced ja is critical in limiting cell death  <cit> . thus, the successful outcome of a given response is not determined by one hormone, but is achieved through balance, interaction and constant recalibration of different plant hormones.

despite extensive research on ros signalling, the exact components mediating ros signalling, ros sensing, and perception in particular are still unknown. here we have analysed transcriptional regulation and the involvement of hormonal signalling in regulating the expression of the whole arabidopsis crk gene subfamily by ros. the effects of ros production in different subcellular compartments was analysed by using o3- and light stress treated plant material and publicly available microarray data. we show that o3-induced transcriptional responses are blocked in the defense, no death  <dig>  mutant, and they are altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling mutants. collectively this reveals alternate pathways in the regulation of ros responses.

RESULTS
crk transcriptional response to o3
several groups of rlks are transcriptionally regulated in response to biotic stresses  <cit> . we identified several crks which were differentially regulated by o <dig> . these results suggest a strong transcriptional regulation of the crks during stress responses. therefore we chose to investigate further the transcriptional regulation of the whole crk subfamily by ros.

according to shiu and bleecker  <cit> , chen et al.  <cit> , and our analysis , the crk subfamily consists of  <dig> members. previously two additional genes have been included, but at4g <dig>  was classified as a pseudogene in the current version of the arabidopsis genome  and at4g <dig>  contains no identifiable extracellular domain, signal peptide or complete kinase domain; thus both genes were excluded from the analysis.

nomenclature of the crk/duf <dig> group of rlks according to chen et al.  <cit>  and shiu and bleecker  <cit> . crk <dig> was not listed in chen et al.  <cit> .

we analysed the transcriptional responses of all the  <dig> crks to extracellular ros produced by o <dig> by quantitative real-time rt-pcr . out of the  <dig> crks,  <dig>  showed more than two-fold higher mrna abundance after 1-hour exposure to o <dig> . after a 6-hour o <dig> exposure followed by a 2-hour recovery period,  <dig> crks exhibited a more than two-fold increase in expression . only crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig> and crk <dig> showed decreased expression in response to o3-treatment. in order to analyze if transcriptional regulation after exposure to o <dig> was a feature of a single subset of the crks, the protein sequence of the kinase domain of all crks was aligned to construct a neighbour-joining tree representing the relations between the members of the crk group of rlks . crks that were transcriptionally regulated in response to o <dig> are high-lighted. o3-regulated genes were distributed across the tree instead of forming a unique branch. however, closely related genes showed a tendency to share similar o <dig> expression patterns.

crk transcriptional response to light stress
to determine the effects of light stress-induced ros production, we monitored the expression of ascorbate peroxidase  <dig> , encoding a ros scavenger and established marker for light-induced ros production  <cit> . apx <dig> was strongly induced after 1- and 2-hour exposure to light stress conditions . in contrast to o <dig> , light stress led to rapid transcriptional repression of several crks . twenty crks were transcriptionally repressed while only eight exhibited increased expression. however, the light-dependent regulation of the crks was not statistically significant. the lack of transcriptional induction in response to light stress corresponds to results from lehti-shiu et al.  <cit> , who reported that the crks were transcriptionally strongly induced in response to biotic stimuli but the expression level decreased in response to abiotic stress . of the abiotic treatments, only uv-b, osmotic stress and wounding resulted in increased expression of crks  <cit> .

crk transcriptional response to pamps is similar to the o <dig> response
to more broadly address transcriptional regulation of the crks, we analyzed and compared their expression profiles from publicly available affymetrix chip data. raw data files were obtained from several databases  and rma  normalized. to take the sample variation into account, parametric bootstrapping combined with bayesian hierarchical clustering  <cit>  was applied. this results in a numerical measure of similarity between treatments and genes, which can be clustered hierarchically . the meta-analysis of the publicly available o <dig> microarray data revealed high overlap with our qpcr data; all eight genes with more than 3-fold increased expression in the publicly available array data exhibited increased expression in our qpcr analysis. treatment with norflurazon  led to decreased expression of four crks. norflurazon blocks carotenoid biosynthesis and thus removes this quencher of the triplet chlorophyll and 1o <dig>  paraquat leads to superoxide  production in the chloroplast by transferring electrons from photosystem i to oxygen. the  is subsequently dismutated to h2o <dig>  paraquat had no effect on crk expression with the exception of the latest time point tested , whereupon five crks exhibited increased expression; four of which were also regulated in response to o <dig>  however, at this time point paraquat had most likely induced cell death. h2o <dig> treatment selectively led to increased expression of a few crks which also displayed increased expression by o <dig>  rotenone  had little impact on crk expression; only crk <dig> showed increased expression levels. thus, the crk expression profile triggered by o <dig> was not related to expression profiles established by other ros treatments. instead, the o3-triggered crk expression profile clustered together with that provoked by several biotic and pamp treatments, including blumeria graminis var. hordei , harpin z , and the flagellin elicitor-active epitope flg <dig> .

our qpcr analysis confirmed the changes caused by flg <dig> in the expression profile of the crks obtained from publicly available microarray data . treatments with benzothiadiazole s-methylester  resulted in two-fold or higher up-regulation of  <dig> crks, some of which also exhibited elevated expression in response to o <dig>  interestingly, in the non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes  <dig>  mutant these genes were not regulated by bth treatment , indicating that sa regulation of these genes was dependent on npr1-mediated signalling. application of methyl-jasmonate  did not cause any major changes in crk expression , whilst aba treatment resulted in decreased expression of crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig> and crk <dig> at late time points. overall, the crk expression profile in response to bth clustered together with that triggered by o <dig>  pathogen and pamp treatments; whereas crk transcriptional regulation upon aba application clustered together with paraquat, norflurazon, rotenone and meja treatments .

taken together, these results demonstrate that the crk expression profile in response to o <dig> is not related to treatments which mediate ros production in the chloroplast or the mitochondria. however, there is a substantial overlap between the transcriptional responses to o <dig> and pathogen infection/pamp perception, which may be a result of apoplastic ros commonly generated by all these stimuli.

crks display different expression in hormone mutants
altered transcriptional regulation of several crks has previously been shown following external application of the plant hormone sa or its active analog bth . in order to address the impact of hormone signalling on transcriptional regulation of crks, we used several mutants impaired in hormone biosynthesis and/or signalling. the salicylic acid induction deficient  <dig>  mutant is deficient in sa biosynthesis , whilst npr <dig> is impaired in sa signalling. the dnd <dig> mutant fails to produce a hypersensitive response , but has functional effector-triggered immunity, constitutive systemic resistance and accumulates elevated sa levels  <cit> . the ethylene insensitive  <dig>  mutant is deficient in et signalling, and the fatty acid desaturase 3/7/ <dig>  mutant is deficient in ja biosynthesis. we compared the transcript abundance of crks in these mutants to col- <dig> wild type plants using qpcr. the obtained actin-2-normalized threshhold cycle values  were compared between col- <dig> wild type and the mutants. several crks showed lower expression in sid <dig> and npr <dig> . crk <dig> displayed higher expression in sid <dig> and ten crks  exhibited higher expression in npr <dig>  in the ein <dig> and fad3/7/ <dig> mutants, for nine and twelve crks, respectively, expression levels were elevated as compared to wild type plants. only crk <dig> and crk <dig> showed lower expression in ein <dig>  along with several other defects, dnd <dig> exhibits constitutive sa responses  <cit> , which might be the cause for the increased transcript levels of  <dig> crks in dnd <dig> signalling -however, other regulatory mechanisms cannot be ruled out due to the pleiotropic nature of the mutant  <cit> . expression of some crks was unaltered or displayed only subtle changes in the sid <dig> mutant, but was elevated in npr <dig>  ein <dig>  fad3/7/ <dig> and dnd <dig> mutants . interaction between hormone signalling pathways is an established phenomenon  <cit> , and the crks above exemplify that altering the balance of sa, ja or et response leads to altered gene expression.

to test the robustness of gene expression in this set of hormone mutants, we compared two different growth conditions. these differed in photoperiod, light composition and intensity, soil composition and humidity , subsequently referred to as weiss chamber  and phytotron . notably, the dnd <dig> mutant did not grow under phytotron conditions. the higher transcript abundance of crks in ein <dig> and fad3/7/ <dig> observed in plants grown under weiss chamber growth conditions was largely absent in plants grown under phytotron growth conditions . moreover, the crks which showed higher gene expression in npr <dig> under weiss chamber growth conditions, were unaltered  in the phytotron. taken together, these results indicate that hormones play a major role in the transcriptional regulation of many crks. however, environmental growth conditions also have a large impact on the extent of this regulation especially in soil grown plants  <cit> .

o3-response of the crks in hormone mutants
to further study the role of sa, et and ja in ros signalling, wild type and the sid <dig>  npr <dig>  dnd <dig>  ein <dig> and fad3/7/ <dig> mutants were exposed to o <dig>  a subset of  <dig> o3-induced and one o3-repressed crks were selected for expression analysis in the mutant backgrounds by qpcr . most o3-induced crks exhibited even higher expression levels in sid <dig> and npr <dig> as compared to wild type, with the exception of crk <dig>  crk <dig>  crk <dig> and crk <dig>  in ein <dig>  the magnitude of crk induction was reduced. in the ja-deficient fad3/7/ <dig> mutant, the increased expression of crks in response to o <dig> was in several cases reduced or even absent as compared to wild type plants. remarkably, o3-triggered increase in expression of crks was absent in dnd <dig> . in summary, these results suggest that the plant hormones sa, ja and et play central roles in the regulation of the expression of the crk subfamily, both under control conditions , as well as in response to o <dig> 

to expand the model for o <dig> regulated gene expression, we tested several other o <dig> inducible marker genes. these genes were selected to represent "classical" marker genes for sa . in addition we selected genes based on our previous o <dig> microarray data , and genes which have previously been described as ja-regulated  or sa- and npr1-regulated . the overall regulation of the marker genes was obtained by clustering them in response to biotic and abiotic stress and hormone treatments . most of the genes were regulated in response to bth, biotic stress treatment and o <dig>  and the mdhar gene was confirmed as a ja marker gene, as previously reported  <cit> . however, there was a lack of overall "specificity" in marker gene expression, i.e., several hormones or stresses were altering their expression. the marker genes were next tested with qpcr in the same o <dig> samples used for crk expression. the genes were strongly induced in col- <dig> wild type plants and in most mutants. however, in dnd <dig> the o3-induced signalling pathway was evidently blocked since o3-induced gene expression was not observed or it was severely reduced. only pathogenesis-related gene  <dig>  was weakly induced in dnd <dig> at the later time point. the classical sa marker genes pr- <dig> and pr- <dig> had reduced o3-induced increased expression in sid <dig> and npr <dig>  indicating a role for sa signalling in response to o <dig>  the loss of o <dig> induction of mdhar in fad3/7/ <dig> confirmed the importance of ja in regulation of this gene.

light stress response of the crks in hormone mutants
to elucidate the role of sa, ja and et in the regulation of crk expression in response to light stress, wild type and the sid <dig>  npr <dig>  ein <dig> and fad3/7/ <dig> mutants were exposed to light stress and the subset of o3-regulated crks was analyzed by qpcr. the transcriptional repression observed in response to light stress  for a majority of crk family members was even more pronounced for some crks in sid <dig> . interestingly, several crks were specifically transcriptionally induced by light stress in the ein <dig> mutant. in fad3/7/ <dig>  most crks exhibited a transient decrease in gene expression at early time points. however, statistical significance was overall low for the light-dependent regulation of the crks in the hormone signalling and biosynthesis mutants .

crk promoter analysis
gene expression is regulated by transcription factors and the promoter elements they bind to. the  <dig> base pair  and  <dig> bp upstream promoter regions of the crks were inspected for significantly enriched promoter elements based on a list of verified arabidopsis promoter elements . the crks were divided into three groups  and searched for significant accumulation of single promoter elements or a combination of promoter elements. statistical significance was measured with the fisher exact test using false discovery rate correction  <cit> . the enrichment was calculated separately for the motifs in both forward and reverse orientations. no elements were enriched in the  <dig> bp region for any of the groups or in the  <dig> bp region of o <dig> down genes. one element, the w-box, a target for wrky transcription factors frequently found in the promoters of sa-regulated genes  <cit> , was significantly overrepresented as a single motif in the group of "crks all" and "crks o <dig> up" in the  <dig> bp region . interestingly, several pairs of promoter elements were present with high statistical significance in the  <dig> bp region for the "crks o <dig> up" and "crks all" groups. since these were mostly the same for both groups and had high statistical significance for the all group, this indicated that they were probably not responsible for the o3-regulation of these genes. the w-box was the only element enriched as a single motif but also present in most pairs of promoter elements. this indicated that the w-box, alone or in combination with other elements, could be a target for the sa and/or pathogen regulation of crks.

the promoters of the crk family were analyzed for enrichment of arabidopsis verified promoter elements. enrichment was calculated for single and double motifs in both plus and minus orientation. the crks were divided into three groups for the analysis: "crks all", "crks o <dig> up" - o <dig> increased expression and "crks o <dig> down" - o <dig> decreased expression.  motif on forward strand,  motif on reverse strand,  motif on either forward or reverse strand. the crks containing the respective motifs are shown in additional file 

discussion
the rlk family is one of the largest gene families in the arabidopsis thaliana genome. several rlks have previously been described to be involved in plant-microbe interactions  <cit>  and abiotic stress  <cit> . based on statistical analysis of gene expression data, rlks in general, as well as the crk subfamily, are more likely to have altered expression in response to abiotic and biotic stress than other arabidopsis genes  <cit> . we analyzed the expression profile of the crks in detail using qpcr and array analysis under various stresses, growth conditions, and in different genetic backgrounds to obtain a better understanding of the signalling pathways leading to transcriptional regulation of the crks and to elucidate the role of apoplastic ros in stress signalling.

the use of ros as signalling molecules is a common feature of many stress responses  <cit> . pathogen attack and perception of pamps are often associated with an oxidative burst in the apoplast  <cit> . similarly, a hallmark of the early o <dig> response is the generation of an oxidative burst in the apoplast  <cit> . ros are also produced in other subcellular compartments, including the chloroplast, where light stress or treatments with the herbicides paraquat or norflurazon elicit elevated ros production. in addition, crosstalk between pathways elicited by apoplastic ros and chloroplast-derived ros is important for the regulation of cell death  <cit> . the transcriptional response to apoplastic ros, e.g. induced by o <dig>  is strikingly different from chloroplast-derived ros, e.g., induced by paraquat  <cit> . to further dissect the role of apoplastic ros, we clustered several treatments triggering ros production in distinct subcellular compartments together with various biotic stress experiments. our results showed that the crk expression profile upon o <dig> exposure was most similar to those stimulated by pamp perception  and pathogen infection  . by contrast, treatments, which increased ros levels in the chloroplast  or mitochondria  either had no effect on crk gene expression or resulted in down-regulation. these results show that transcriptional induction of the crks can be triggered by apoplastic ros, whereas chloroplastic ros mainly lead to decreased expression. furthermore, cluster analysis separated the effects of plant hormones: bth  caused a similar expression profile as o <dig> and pamp treatments, whereas crk expression in response to aba and meja was related to norflurazon and paraquat treatments.

to extend the microarray meta-analysis, transcript accumulation of the crk subfamily was monitored in response to o <dig> and light stress by qpcr. out of  <dig> crks,  <dig> showed increased expression after exposure to o <dig> at both time points while five members exhibited decreased expression. light stress treatment led to a decrease in expression of the majority of the crks. thus, in agreement with the results from array analysis, ros production in different cellular compartments produces strikingly different transcriptional profiles on the crk gene subfamily.

to further dissect the o <dig> response, mutants deficient in biosynthesis, perception and signalling of sa , ja  and et  were exposed to o <dig> and the expression of a subset of crks was analyzed by qpcr. the o3-induced increase in transcript levels of the crks was higher in sid <dig> and npr <dig> implying that sa acts as a negative regulator of the ros signalling pathway. the o3-mediated transcriptional induction of crks was almost abolished in fad3/7/ <dig> and attenuated in ein <dig>  suggesting that ja, and to a lesser extent et are required for the proper transcriptional induction of crks in response to o <dig>  this role for sa, ja and et in o <dig> signalling has been previously proposed based on the results from cdna macroarray analysis  <cit> . the effect of light stress on the crk expression in various mutant backgrounds was very different compared to the effect of the o <dig> response. whereas et acts as positive regulator of crk expression in the o <dig> response, it appears to be a negative regulator in light stress since several crks displayed light stress-induced expression only in the ein <dig> mutant . under light stress conditions, the decreased expression of crks seen in wild type was even more pronounced in the sa mutants sid <dig> and npr <dig> and the ja mutant fad3/7/ <dig> 

dnd <dig> encodes cyclic nucleotide gated channel <dig>  which transports ca2+ into the cell and regulates nitric oxide production  <cit> . the complete lack of an effect of o <dig> on crk and marker gene expression in dnd <dig> suggests an important role for cngc <dig> in the o <dig> response pathway, possibly by regulating ca2+ levels . previous studies have shown that o <dig> rapidly invokes ca2+ transients  <cit>  and blocking of ca2+ transport can prevent ros-induced cell death  <cit> . the dnd <dig> mutant also has several pleiotropic phenotypes which include elevated sa levels and constitutive defence responses  <cit> . consequently, the lack of o <dig> response in dnd <dig> could be due to "dominance" of sa signaling over the ros signalling pathway, and o <dig> would have no effect when the sa pathway is fully stimulated. previous reports have shown that several members of the crk subfamily were transcriptionally induced through an external application of sa  <cit>  or bth . the response of crks to bth was completely blocked in npr <dig>  indicating that the sa pathway for regulating crks requires npr <dig> 

intriguingly, different growth conditions had a strong impact on the expression of crks in various mutants. several crks were expressed to higher levels in ein <dig> and fad3/7/ <dig> in weiss chamber-grown plants compared to phytotron-grown plants. in contrast, the decreased expression of several crks in sid <dig> and npr <dig> was similar between two different growth conditions . a strong effect of environmental conditions on mutant phenotypes, transcript profiles and other parameters are well known and a common problem when comparing results from different laboratories  <cit> . there could be several reasons for the differences in the expression levels of the crks between the weiss chambers and the phytotron growth conditions. plants were tested at slightly different ages and grown in different soil . illumination in the weiss chambers was provided using fluorescent lamps while in lighting in the phytotron was using metal halide lamps with different light spectra. notably, the crks are responsive to uv-b  <cit> . this suggests that light conditions could have an effect on the expression profile of this rlk family. another reason for this variation of gene expression could be that under control conditions most crks were expressed at very low levels; consequently, a minor perturbation either by genetic mutation or growth condition could lead to altered expression. thus, expression of crks is very sensitive to the surrounding environment. similar observations have been reported for the expression of the classical pdf <dig>  marker gene  <cit> . this gene has long been used to exemplify co-regulation by ja/et. however, pdf <dig>  is only regulated by both hormones when plants are grown in vitro  <cit> . when plants are grown in soil, either hormone alone  is sufficient to induce expression. thus, growth in soil is able to induce or prime defence signalling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the crk expression patterns and integrating current knowledge of ros signalling, pamp perception and light responses  <cit> , we propose a model for the regulation of increased expression of the crks : o <dig> induces ros production in the apoplast which is perceived by putative "ros receptors"  amplified by plant respiratory burst oxidase homolog -mediated  production, thus leading to activation of dnd1/cngc <dig>  this activates further down-stream signalling events where ja and to a lesser extent et act as positive regulators, and sa and npr <dig> as negative regulators of crk expression. eventually, the signal reaches the nucleus where transcription factors bind to a "ros" promoter element and activate transcription. in parallel, the genes are also regulated through a sa  and npr1-dependent pathway converging on the w-box promoter element. microbes and pamps could activate both pathways at different timing; a rapid pathway would act through a rboh mediated ros production and use the "ros pathway", while a later "sa pathway" requires increased sa biosynthesis and npr <dig>  further interconnections between the pathways are provided by the primary et transcription factors ethylene insensitive  <dig>  and ethylene insensitive 3-like  which repress sid2/ics <dig> expression and thus decrease sa levels  <cit> . light stress or chemical treatments that increase ros in the chloroplast activate separate signalling pathway mainly leading to repression of crk expression, which could involve aba and negative crosstalk with the sa pathway.

is it possible to separate the roles of chloroplastic and apoplastic ros in the regulation of crk expression? chloroplast-derived ros production is known to be involved in the regulation of cell death during pathogen infection and in response to abiotic stress  <cit> . specific removal of chloroplastic ros prevents pathogen-induced cell death but has no impact on defence gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, chloroplastic 1o <dig> regulates cell death dependent on executer <dig>  <cit> . in comparison, apoplastic ros might be involved with intra- and intercellular signalling  <cit> . thus, apoplastic ros would have a role in regulating defence gene expression and chloroplastic ros in regulation of cell death. in addition, there is crosstalk between apoplastic ros and chloroplast ros; rapid ros production in the chloroplast can be detected in response to o <dig> and blocking of ros production in the chloroplast reduces o3-induced cell death  <cit> . clearly, ros regulation of defence signalling and/or cell death is very complex and several other regulatory components have been identified, including lesion simulating disease  <dig> , enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  and phytoalexin deficient  <dig> , which are also involved in acclimation to light stress  <cit> . the only known phenotypes for crks have been obtained by ectopic overexpression, which induces hr-like cell death independent or dependent on sa signalling   <cit> . how this induction of cell death might be achieved is still unclear since transcriptional regulation of crks occurs in response to apoplastic rather than chloroplastic ros. some members of the rlk family might participate in a positive feed-forward loop to regulate ros production, defence gene expression, cell death and hormone signalling. this regulatory loop might be deregulated after overexpression of the crks leading to the observed cell death phenotypes. however, this will require experimental verification in the future.

what is the role of crks in plants and why are they regulated by pamps and o <dig> treatment? the external domain of these rlks could be the receptor for as yet uncharacterized pamps and they could be part of plant immune responses. an intriguing feature of the duf <dig> domain is the presence of a conserved cysteine motif c-8x-c-2x-c. the configuration of cysteines is similar to the cysteine motif in the grim reaper protein, which has been shown to be involved in the regulation of ros induced cell death  <cit> . despite the ubiquitous role of ros as signalling molecules in plants, no direct receptor for ros has been described. since cysteines are sensitive to redox modifications, could the duf <dig> domain act as sensor of ros in the apoplast and be the putative ros sensor as depicted in figure 9?
