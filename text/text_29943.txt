BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small regulatory rnas  that play crucial roles in diverse aspects of plant development  <cit> , biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> , signal transduction and protein degradation  <cit> . mirnas are generated by stepwise processing of rna polymerase ii -dependent primary mirna transcripts . the pri-mirnas typically form an imperfect fold-back structure, which is processed into a stem-loop precursor  and further excised as an rna duplex by the dicer-like <dig>  enzyme. partial or complete base-pairing between the mirna and its target rna allows the mirna-associated rna-induced silencing complexes  to promote translational inhibition, accelerated exonucleolytic mrna decay, and/or mrna cleavage through slicing within mirna-mrna base-pairing . the majority of the target genes of highly conserved mirnas are transcription factors that play important roles in development  <cit> . conversely, lineage-specific mirnas seem to regulate the expression of a broader type of genes, including those involved in cellular metabolism, stress response, and post-translational modifications  <cit> .

the identification of mirnas and their targets in a large number of plant species is an important step to understand the function and evolution of mirnas and mirna-dependent gene regulation. over  <dig>  mirnas from eudicotyledoneous and  <dig> mirnas from monocotyledonous plants have been deposited in the latest release of mirbase . although deep sequencing methods have substantially contributed to the identification of conserved and lineage-specific mirnas in model species  <cit> , these approaches are time-consuming and relatively expensive. in this regard, public est databases and genomic survey sequences  have become attractive alternatives to identify non-coding sequences through computational approaches in non-model plants.

the fact that most known mirnas are evolutionarily conserved raises the possibility of identifying new mirna homologs in other species using computer-based strategies  <cit> , and such in silico approaches have been reviewed and classified not only as homology-based but also as structure similarity-based searches  <cit> . therefore, recent computational methods provide an accurate, fast, inexpensive, and consequently convenient way to retrieve mirna precursor sequences from publicly available sequence databases. finally, target mrnas of conserved mirnas can be searched using web-based  <cit>  or in-house algorithms and analyzed across plant species.

most identified mirnas and their targets have been predicted in plants for which whole genome information is available such as arabidopsis thaliana and rice. currently, there is no experimental and only scarce computational information about mirnas and their targets in sugarcane . sugarcane is an economically important biofuel crop. recently, it has become a target for improvement of sustainable biomaterial production due to its high biomass productivity and built-in containment features  <cit> . modern sugarcane cultivars are highly polyploid, aneuploid hybrids between s. officinarum l.  and s. spontaneum l. . modern sugarcane cultivars typically have 2n = 100- <dig> chromosomes, of which approximately 15-20% are derived from s. spontaneum and 5% are recombinants derived from both species. therefore, the genome of modern sugarcane cultivars has at least  <dig> copies of most homologous loci, contributing to the high complexity of its genome  <cit> .

in this study, we used conserved mirnas to systematically search public est and gss databases for sugarcane pri-mirnas or mirna precursors. a total of  <dig> distinct sugarcane pri-mirnas were identified by our computational protocol, of which nine are monocot-specific. the expression profiles of selected sugarcane mirnas were monitored by pulsed stem-loop rt-pcr  <cit>  in organs/tissues of a modern cultivar as well as in s. officinarum and s. spontaneum. to identify target genes of the identified mirnas, we developed a blast-based computational tool to search the ncbi est and bac sequences of sugarcane, rice, and sorghum. by using this method, we predicted several target messages, of which one novel target was experimentally tested and confirmed. finally, we integrated sugarcane mirna primary precursor and target information into a web-based database , which is publicly available. the identification of mirnas and their targets is important not only to help us learn more about the roles of mirnas in sugarcane development and physiology, but also to provide a framework for further studies on rnai-based regulation mechanisms in this highly polyploid species.

RESULTS
identification of mirna primary transcripts in saccharum spp
mirnas have been intensively studied in a wide range of plants over the past few years  <cit> , but no systematic and comprehensive study has been performed on sugarcane, one of the most promising biofuel crops worldwide  <cit> . in order to computationally identify mirnas in sugarcane, we developed a homology-based strategy based on  <cit>  that included the following steps: first, we searched the sugarcane est and gss databases to find sequences matching previously known plant mirnas. then we predicted the secondary structures of the potential precursor sequences using mfold. the third step consisted of an in-house mircheck-based script to verify the putative pri-mirna candidates , followed by a manual inspection to eliminate possible false positives. finally, closely related est sequences were blasted against each other to detect redundancy and then further analyzed. we considered as one mirna precursor those ests sharing > 95% identity at the sequence level. this protocol allowed us to retrieve  <dig> distinct mirna precursors that were classified into  <dig> families . amongst them,  <dig> mirna precursors were found in the est database and a single one was found in the gss sequences, indicating the latter is still a poor source of in silico mirna discovery in sugarcane. although previous reports have identified some sugarcane mirna precursors  <cit> , in this study we have advanced these findings by systematically analyzing these precursors as well as identifying new ones. for instance, we identified precursors for sugarcane mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . moreover, we evaluated the expression patterns of selected mirnas in different sugarcane tissues/organs .

the sugarcane mirna families identified in this study include the six families already deposited in the mirbase , indicating the robustness of our approach. nonetheless, careful inspection of the sugarcane mirna precursor sequences deposited in the mirbase v. <dig> and comparison with our analysis revealed some divergences between these databases. for example, the ssmir156b/c  was previously annotated as a single stem-loop mir <dig> precursor . however, our analyses revealed that this precursor belongs to a cluster representing a two-tandem microrna precursor, which is highly similar to its sorghum homolog  and to the maize corngrass <dig> microrna   <cit> . moreover, genomic dna pcr amplification from sugarcane hybrid rb 83- <dig> using specific primers and subsequent sequencing indicate that ssmir156b/c locus encodes tandem mir <dig> genes . comparison among the mirbase-derived precursor sequences and with those identified in this study suggests that the  <dig> previously annotated sugarcane mirna precursors represent only eight different precursors . for instance, we identified only two distinct precursors of mir <dig>  ssmir408a and ssmir408b , instead of five . closer inspection suggests that ssmir408a and ssmir408b are likely different alleles of the same locus. this observation is supported by the fact that mir <dig> genes have been found only as one copy in all plant genomes evaluated to date . the discrepancies between our data and previous annotation in the mirbase may be due to the use of sogi release  <dig>   that contains substantially more tentative consensus  than the earlier releases, which likely reflect differences in est clustering or assembling.

in agreement with previous results  <cit> , most sugarcane mirna sequences have uracil as their first nucleotide . moreover, sugarcane mirna precursors displayed high minimal free energy index  values , which is a criterion used for distinguishing mirna precursors from other types of rnas. mfei is a parameter that considers not only the minimal free energy  value of a particular sequence but also its length and g+c content. mfei values were calculated as described by  <cit> .

mirnas are located either in the 5'-arm or 3'-arm of the stem-loop hairpin pre-mirna sequences . all new identified mirna precursors could fold into stem-loop structures , following the rules and parameters reported by  <cit> . one exception was the est tc <dig>  which displays high similarity  with one of the mir <dig> precursors present in the draft of the sorghum bicolor genome  <cit>  . it could not form a suitable stem-loop structure and thus it was not validated by our in-house mircheck-based script. this might be due to the fact that the mir319* is located at the 5'end of the sequence, which is not present in the tc <dig> sugarcane est. nevertheless, based on its extensive homology with sorghum mir <dig> precursor , we annotated this tc as a potential ssmir <dig> precursor . that most ests do not contain their entire 5'-end sequence information undermines est databases as sources for mirna precursor searching. based on the example given in this study, it may be interesting to develop rules and parameters to assign est sequences as mirna precursors based only upon extensive nucleotide identity with precursors from highly closely related species.

not only ssmir <dig>  but several sugarcane pre-mirnas show high sequence similarity with their sorghum homologs . sorghum and sugarcane are each other's closest relatives among cultivated crops. they belong to the andropogoneae tribe and diverged from a common ancestor around 8- <dig> myr ago  <cit> . based on genomic sequence comparisons  <cit> , it is likely that sugarcane and sorghum did not have sufficient time to diverge, which reflects the high degree of identity observed between their mirna precursors.

this feature allowed us, by using sugarcane mir <dig> pre-mirna sequence, to identify the sorghum mir <dig> precursor , which was not annotated in previous work  <cit> . sorghum mir <dig> precursor is located at chromosome  <dig> . the mature mir <dig> is highly conserved among grasses and displays few mismatches with sequences from arabidopsis and populus . the new sorghum mirna precursor was validated by our in-house mircheck-based script and it showed high similarity with its sugarcane homolog not only at the sequence level, but also at a secondary structure level .

among the monocot-specific mirna precursors, we have identified three potential precursors of microrna <dig> . interestingly, ssmir444b and ssmir444c contain tandem and overlapping mature mirna sequences , similar to mir <dig> precursors identified in rice and sorghum  <cit> . at least in rice, such precursors are able to generate natural antisense mirnas, or nat-mirnas. the production of nat-mirnas depends upon sense/antisense transcription and alternative splicing of the precursors prior to dcl <dig> cleavage  <cit> . these nat-mirnas seem to be restricted to monocot graminae, indicating this new pathway is less than  <dig> million years old.

recent works suggest that some plant and human mirna families are derived from a subset of dna-type transposable elements  called miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements . mites evolved from corresponding ancestral full-length  elements that originally encoded short interfering rnas . piriyapongsa and jordan  <cit>  found several examples in rice and arabidopsis supporting the notion that evolutionary intermediates may exist as tes that encode both sirnas and mirnas. moreover, voinnet  <cit>  suggests an association of recently evolved mirna families with mites. thus, we compared the identified sugarcane pri-mirna sequences against the gramineae repeat database  using blastn  to identify possible mite-derived hairpin precursors. only mir <dig> and all three mir <dig> precursors presented substantial similarity with known mites . accordingly, their maize homologs also have similarity with mite-derived hairpin sequences  <cit> . it has been shown in arabidopsis that mirna genes evolved via local inverted duplication events, which generated sequences capable of folding back into hairpin structures when expressed  <cit> . similarly, over the course of evolution, mites might have stimulated the rnai biogenesis enzymes to process hairpin-like structures to generate mirnas with endogenous gene regulatory functions  <cit> . we were able to detect mature mir <dig> by rt-pcr - as shown in the next section - and sequencing of the generated amplicon confirmed its identity . moreover, multiple sequence alignment of pre-mir <dig> from sugarcane, switchgrass  and wheat   <cit>  suggests partial conservation of the mir <dig> and mir1128* among these species, but not the surrounding precursor sequences . along with other requirements  <cit> , the conservation of the mirna and mirna* sequences in the precursor is a critical parameter to define a mirna-generating locus. taken together, our data support the mirna status of the sugarcane mir <dig>  however, we cannot rule out the possibility that mite-associated mirnas may lose their mirna status in the future  <cit> .

given the limited number of sugarcane est and gss sequences available as well as existent sequencing errors, the frequency of candidate mirna precursors identified in this study is comparable to others using such databases  <cit> . it is noteworthy that all mirnas reported in this study have been identified using previously known mirnas from several plant species. therefore, we did not uncover mirnas that are specific to sugarcane. further investigations that employ small rna libraries combined with computational approaches are needed to identify sugarcane-specific mirnas.

expression patterns of sugarcane mirnas
the expression pattern of a mirna in organs/tissues might provide initial clues regarding its biological function. therefore, we evaluated the expression of selected mirnas identified in this work . we have chosen one mirna poorly conserved , one highly conserved among plant species , and four potential monocot-specific mirnas . in this study, stem-loop rt-pcr approach was applied to detect mature mirna species in distinct organs/tissues from the commercial sugarcane hybrid rb 83- <dig>  the mirnas were detected in all organs/tissues analyzed, although with distinct expression profiles . transcripts of mir <dig> accumulate at high levels in all organs/tissues but lateral buds, while mir <dig> accumulates at higher levels only in leaf blade tissues. sugarcane mir <dig> and mir <dig> seem to be similarly expressed in the organs/tissues evaluated . mir <dig> mature transcripts accumulate at higher levels in leaf sheath and lateral buds, whereas mir <dig> transcripts were detected at lower levels in lateral buds. it is noteworthy that all tested ssmirnas, though at variable levels, are expressed in lateral buds . sugarcane is typically propagated via rhizomes, which contain one or more lateral buds. the new plantlet will arise from these buds and further develop into mature plants . therefore, efficient bud outgrowth is an extremely important step for the initial development of sugarcane. it is possible that some of these mirnas play important roles in the genetic regulation of sugarcane lateral bud outgrowth. functional studies may provide clues on the possible roles of these mirnas in the early development of sugarcane.

we also compared the expression profiles of these mirnas between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum to evaluate whether both species produce detectable mature mirna molecules. all mirnas are detected in the evaluated organs/tissues from these two closely related species . although most mirnas seem to accumulate similarly in both species, some presented variations in abundance when comparing the same organs/tissues at similar developmental stages of s. officinarum and s. spontaneum. for example, mir <dig> is slightly more abundant in vegetative apex of s. officinarum. in contrast, mir <dig> accumulates at higher levels in leaf blade tissues of s. spontaneum . similar data was observed for mirnas accumulating in some organs/tissues of stable arabidopsis allopolyploids  <cit> . the relatively low variation in mirna accumulation between these species is likely a reflection of their level of ploidy. highly polyploid species might have developed a genetic buffering against extensive mirna expression variation in particular organs/tissues or developmental stages to maintain target gene expression stability across generations of ploidy  <cit> . our data also present the possibility that both ancient species contributed similarly to the mirna-based regulatory pathways present in modern sugarcane hybrids. it will be interesting to test whether all target loci in hybrid modern cultivars are down-regulated by mirnas from one ancient progenitor or from both.

the final spatiotemporal accumulation of mature small rnas relies, at least in part, upon the transcriptional control of microrna  genes  <cit>  and such regulation may be conserved among closely related species. to gain more insight into the transcriptional regulation of the sugarcane mir genes, we analyzed in silico the ssmir <dig> locus, which has available genomic sequences . firstly, we employed eshadow software  <cit>  to search for evolutionary conserved regions in mir <dig> locus from sugarcane, sorghum, and maize. we detected several potentially conserved regions, of which most are localized upstream of the predicted pre-mirna and one highly conserved region includes the pre-mir <dig> . secondly, we scanned for putative conserved transcription factor binding  sites as well as for tandem repeats and cpg/cpnpg islands using jaspar  and plantpan  <cit>  databases, respectively. cpg/cpnpg islands are regions of the genome typically associated with promoters and 5' ends of several genes. hypo or hypermethylation of cpg/cpnpg islands in plants are of considerable interest because they relate to patterns of gene regulation, epigenetic phenomena, and chromosome structure  <cit> .

although we did not detect any tandem repeats, the cpg/cpnpg islands found in the three mir <dig> loci overlap broadly with the possibly conserved regions upstream of pre-mir <dig>  these regions also included common predicted tfb sites for the investigated species, such as an auxin response element  . taken together, these findings suggest the promoter regions of the sugarcane mir <dig> locus share conserved elements with its sorghum and maize homologs. such elements might be biologically important for the final organ/tissue localization of mir <dig> mature species and, consequently, for target down-regulation. it has recently been reported an evolutionary sequencing comparison for the mir319a locus in arabidopsis and related brassicaceae. reporter experiments have demonstrated that regions under stronger evolutionary constraints contain important information for mir319a transcription  <cit> . as more sugarcane genomic sequences become available, it will be interesting to verify whether most, if not all homologous mirnas between sorghum and sugarcane also share conserved elements in their promoters.

potential targets of sugarcane mirnas
previous studies demonstrated that mirnas regulate gene expression mainly by binding to perfect or near-perfect complementary sites of mrna sequences  <cit> . such behavior indicates that plant mirna targets can be predicted by simple sequence homology-based searches. using an in-house blastn-based algorithm , we identified a total of  <dig> potential distinct target sequences for the  <dig> identified sugarcane mirna families. consistent with the essential roles of mirnas in regulating a variety of biological processes in plants  <cit> , sugarcane target genes seem to be associated not only with development but also with diverse physiological processes . because ncbi sugarcane est database is limited and its corresponding proteins have not yet been fully annotated, we have additionally applied the same search for rice and sorghum protein-coding sequences. most sugarcane mirna targets identified here have homologs in rice and sorghum . although it is unlikely that true targets have been missed in our search, it is important to mention that blast-based search strategies have limitations to detect some targets even if a word size of seven is used. one such example of this are the mirnas mir395b, mir395c, and mir395f targeting aps <dig>  and aps <dig>  genes within arabidopsis  <cit> . the longest stretch of matching base pairs is six, which falls under the minimum word size employed by blast  <cit> .

interestingly, some target genes that are conserved across angiosperms seem to have lost their mirna-based regulation in specific lineages  <cit> . one such example seems to be the new targets for the possible monocot-specific mir <dig> . the three identified ests encode cu2+-binding domain-containing proteins . to evaluate the relationship between this lineage-specific mirna and its angiosperm-conserved targets, we initially investigated the accumulation of mature mir <dig> transcripts in distinct monocots and in the core eudicot arabidopsis. as expected, mir <dig> transcripts were detected in all graminaceous monocots but not in arabidopsis . although targets for the mir <dig> have been recently predicted in maize  <cit> , no experimental validation has been done to confirm such predictions. thus, we used the rlm-race method to map the cleavage sites in one of the predicted sscbps. as expected, most 5'-ends of the sscbp <dig> mrna fragments were mapped to the nucleotide that pairs to the tenth nucleotide of the microrna, confirming its cleavage guided by mir <dig> .

to gain more insight into the evolutionary history of the cbps, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using sscbp <dig> sequence as a query to search for homologous proteins within genomic and est databanks of a set of green plants, including angiosperms, basal land plants, and green algae . our analysis revealed that sscbp <dig> belongs to a possible group of orthologous  that integrates only angiosperm sequences . the simplest explanation is that these genes share a common origin within the last common ancestor of angiosperms. interestingly, the mir528-target recognition site is only present within monocot genes from pogo a . all eudicots orthologous to sscbp <dig> from arabidopsis, poplar, grape, and soybean genomes completely lack the mir528-target recognition site, suggesting that mir <dig> is indeed a monocot-specific microrna. taken together, our findings support the notion that the regulation of sscbp <dig> by mir <dig> is shared at least within graminaceous monocots, and this mirna-based post-transcriptional regulation evolved exclusively within the monocots lineage after the divergence from eudicots. further studies on plant cbps are needed to define their physiological role and the possible evolutionary advantages given by the mir528-based post-transcriptional regulation of monocot sscbp <dig> orthologs.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that several sugarcane mirna precursors share high homology with their sorghum's possible orthologous beyond mirna mature sequence. in the case of pre-mir <dig>  which was obtained from genomic sequences, we found precursor-surrounding regions conserved among sugarcane, sorghum, and maize homologs. this finding indicates these genes may share common genetic and epigenetic regulatory programs. however, further work that includes additional homologous sequences from other closely related species is required to confirm such conservation. our data also indicate that sugarcane mirnas are expressed in commercial hybrids as well as in the ancient progenitors s. officinarum and s. spontaneum. our approach leads to the prediction of several conserved and non-conserved sugarcane mirna targets in the available est and genomic databases. the data is available in the public website  that will be continuously updated to incorporate future mirbase updates. our findings will be a useful resource toward tracing the evolution of small rna-based regulation in sugarcane and related species. most importantly, this study will serve as a foundation for future research into the functional roles of mirnas and their target genes in this important biofuel crop.
