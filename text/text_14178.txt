BACKGROUND
normal cells cultured in vitro undergo a characteristic number of divisions before entering a non-dividing state termed senescence  <cit> . most cells are unable to overcome senescence to continue dividing unless key tumor suppressor pathways are first altered. cellular immortalization has been achieved by the inactivation of the p <dig> and rb pathways or by the activation of telomerase  <cit> . while spontaneous immortalization is an extremely rare event in human cells  <cit> , rodent cells spontaneously immortalize at much greater rates  <cit> . for avian cells, spontaneous immortalization also has been very rare, with only two other spontaneously immortalized chicken cell lines reported .

the tumor suppressor gene, p <dig>  has often been referred to as the 'cellular gatekeeper' or the 'guardian of the genome' because of its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular damage  <cit> . the p <dig> protein is dysfunctional in most human cancers, with p <dig> itself being mutated in about half of these cancers. in the other half of cancers when p <dig> itself is not mutated, it is inactivated indirectly as a result of alterations in the gene products that interact with p <dig> or transmit information to or from p <dig>  <cit> . in normal cells, the main negative regulator of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  maintains a relatively short p <dig> half-life by targeting it for degradation, thus preventing it from exerting antiproliferative effects  <cit> . the mdm <dig> and p <dig> proteins operate in a feedback loop whereby mdm <dig> degrades p <dig> while p <dig> activates transcription of mdm <dig>  thereby helping to maintain low p <dig> levels in normal cells  <cit> . another important gene involved in the p <dig> pathway is arf, which binds directly to mdm <dig>  protecting p <dig> from degradation and allowing for the increased expression of p <dig>  <cit> . one study showed that senescence requires an increase in the levels of arf and that conversely, fibroblasts lacking arf proliferate indefinitely  <cit> . many signals activate p <dig> such as dna damage, telomere shortening, hypoxia, and aberrant proliferative signals. upon activation, p <dig> induces a g1/s phase cell cycle arrest that is mediated by p21waf <dig>  <cit> , which functions by inhibiting the cdks  during the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, thereby preventing cell cycle progression  <cit> . consistent with this, the levels of p21waf <dig> have been reported to be elevated in senescent cells  <cit> .

the other main tumor suppressor mechanism involves the rb pathway, and alterations in this pathway have been shown to lead to tumorigenesis  <cit> . throughout the cell cycle rb undergoes changes in phosphorylation, with a hyperphosphorylated form predominant in proliferating cells and a hypophosphorylated form predominant in quiescent or differentiating cells  <cit> . as rb is hyperphosphorylated by cdk-cyclins in the mid-to-late g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, rb is unable to bind and inhibit the actions of e2f- <dig>  allowing e2f- <dig> to promote cell cycle progression from the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle into the s phase  <cit> . senescent cells express high levels of the cdk-inhibitor, p16ink4a, which prevents cdk-cyclins from phosphorylating rb, keeping e2f- <dig> bound to rb and unable to promote entry into the s phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . the p16ink4a gene is inactivated in many tumor cell lines  <cit> , while overexpression of p16ink4a results in g <dig> arrest  <cit> .

in the present study, mrna and protein expression levels of various genes involved in the p <dig> and rb pathways were measured in multiple passages of a spontaneously immortalized cef cell line, sc- <dig>  by analyzing the expression of important cell cycle regulatory genes at various stages of the immortalization process it was observed that the sc- <dig> cells underwent an initial crisis period between passages  <dig> and  <dig> and another transition period at about passage  <dig>  from this data, it has been hypothesized that following the initial crisis period, changes in the expression of important cell cycle regulatory genes allowed the cells to continue growing. it is quite possible that additional coordinated fluctuations in gene expression allowed the cells to increase their growth rate at approximately passage  <dig> and to become fully immortal.

RESULTS
growth rate and morphological analysis
in the present study the third reverse transcriptase -negative spontaneously immortalized chicken cell line  was established. data were obtained from many different passages of sc- <dig> cells, but only shown for passages  <dig> and  <dig>  since they represent the major transition phases that occurred in the sc- <dig> cells. an examination of this type has been performed for another spontaneously immortalized cell line   <cit> , but the expression of most cell cycle regulatory genes were very different compared to the sc- <dig> cells.

the sc- <dig> cell line was derived from primary cef cells that were thawed at passage  <dig>  between passages  <dig> and  <dig> the growth rate of the cef cells averaged  <dig>  population doublings per day . the cells entered a crisis period between passages  <dig> and  <dig>  during which their growth rate was negligible except for measurable growth between passages  <dig> and  <dig>  during this crisis period, cells were refed every 2â€“ <dig> days and passaged until small foci of cells appeared. at about passage  <dig> a subpopulation of cells emerged that was able to overcome cellular senescence and continue growing when other cells in the population succumbed to cell death. these cells were considered to have an extended lifespan and as such were designated the sc- <dig> cell line. the sc- <dig> cells continued to grow slowly between passages  <dig> and  <dig> averaging  <dig>  pd/d. passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were flattened and enlarged compared to the presenescent cef cells. the phenotype of the sc- <dig> cells changed dramatically at about passage  <dig>  appearing smaller than observed earlier at passage  <dig> and possessing a small, compact morphology, similar to df- <dig> cells . coinciding with the dramatic morphological change at passage  <dig>  the growth rate of the sc- <dig> cells increased to an average of  <dig>  pd/d after passage  <dig> . the sc- <dig> cells are currently at passage  <dig> and have maintained the improved morphology and increased growth rate since passage  <dig>  the sc- <dig> cells displayed contact inhibition when grown to confluence, did not show evidence of multi-layered growth, and did not form colonies when grown in a semi-solid agarose suspension , suggesting that these cells lacked many of the properties of transformed cells. karyotypic analysis  of the sc- <dig> cells indicated that they displayed a normal diploid karyotype. the sc- <dig> cells were analyzed twice for rt activity and mycoplasma contamination and found to be negative for both .

facs analysis showed that sc- <dig> cells possessed a distinct cell cycle distribution compared to either primary passage  <dig> cef or immortal df- <dig> cells . the percentage of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle was 65% for primary passage  <dig> cef cells, 48% for sc- <dig> cells, and 30% for immortal passage  <dig> df- <dig> cells.

cell growth rates were compared as shown in figure 2b. passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells had a very slow growth rate, with only  <dig>  pd/d after six days, while passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells showed increased growth rates  that where more similar to primary cef cells . the df- <dig> cells displayed the highest growth rate at  <dig>  pd/d after four days.

analysis of p <dig> and p53-regulated genes
because of the importance the p <dig> pathway plays in controlling the cell cycle, an examination of p <dig> and its related genes was performed during the conversion process in the sc- <dig> cell line using rt-pcr and southern blot analysis. like many other studies, an increase in p <dig> mrna expression  was observed in normal senescent passage  <dig> cef cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells . the decreased p <dig> mrna expression in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells agrees with other studies that have observed decreased expression of p <dig> in immortal cells  <cit> . unexpectedly, increased p <dig> levels were observed in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells that were similar to levels in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells. one possible explanation for this observation is the functional inactivation of p <dig> via deletion or point mutations. however, the nucleotide sequence of p <dig> mrna in the sc- <dig> cells was identical to that of the published chicken p <dig> mrna sequence  for the first portion of the 5'-end and the remainder of the 3'-end. we have had difficulties in sequencing the remaining approximate  <dig> bp , which is predominantly double-stranded  <cit> . with over 80% of the molecule sequenced, it appears that there are no deletions or mutations that exist. these results suggest that other cellular modifications may be responsible for the altered activity of p <dig> in the sc- <dig> cells.

to determine whether the fluctuation in p <dig> mrna levels affected other genes involved in the pathway, mrna expression levels of mdm <dig>  which is the predominant negative regulator of p <dig>  were examined. although the mdm <dig> gene is upregulated in 30%-40% of human tumors  <cit> , the levels of mdm <dig> in the sc- <dig> cells were similar to levels observed in normal primary passage  <dig> cef cells. the levels of mdm <dig> were expected to be higher in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells since p <dig> mrna levels were elevated. a possible explanation for the unchanged levels of mdm <dig> in the present study was that p <dig> protein was inactive and not able to participate with mdm <dig> in the normal feedback loop.

another important target of p <dig> is p21waf <dig>  a gene that causes arrest at the g <dig> and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle. in order to assess whether or not the fluctuating p <dig> levels were functional, mrna expression of p21waf <dig> was measured. similar to other studies  <cit> , levels of p21waf <dig> dramatically increased in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells . significant down-regulation of p21waf <dig> mrna was observed in all passages of sc- <dig> cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells. since the p21waf <dig> gene is up-regulated by p <dig> in response to dna damage  <cit> , the fact that the sc- <dig> cells possessed extremely low expression levels of p21waf <dig>  even in the presence of elevated levels of p <dig> mrna, suggested that p <dig> may be functionally inactive.

the related gene p27kip <dig>  which belongs to the same family as p21waf <dig> , is a cdk inhibitor that prevents transition from the g <dig> to s phase of the cell cycle. similar to p21waf <dig>  levels of p27kip <dig> also increased at senescence in normal cef cells . the levels of p27kip <dig> in the immortal df- <dig> cells and the sc- <dig> cells at passage  <dig> were slightly elevated. however, by passage  <dig>  levels of p27kip <dig> in the sc- <dig> cells had increased by almost 40% over levels observed in primary passage  <dig> cef cells.

another member of the kip/cip family is p57kip <dig>  which when over-expressed, has been shown to lead to growth arrest at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle in two different cell lines  <cit> . conversion of a lifespan extended population of human mammary epithelial cells to a fully immortal phenotype was marked by a dramatic decrease in p57kip <dig> expression, indicating that p57kip <dig> may be used as a marker of fully immortal cell lines  <cit> . here p57kip <dig> levels were slightly increased  in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells . however, in contrast to others who have observed decreased expression of p57kip <dig> mrna in immortal cell lines  <cit> , the sc- <dig> cells at passages  <dig> and  <dig> and the immortal df- <dig> cells possessed significantly increased levels of p57kip <dig>  while the levels of p57kip <dig> in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were increased by 134% over primary passage  <dig> cef cells, the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells still possessed levels of p57kip <dig> that were 85% greater than the levels expressed in primary passage  <dig> cef cells, but these levels had decreased considerably from the levels measured in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells. this suggested that the sc- <dig> cells still may be in the process of converting to a fully immortal phenotype.

to determine if the altered p <dig> transcriptional activity in sc- <dig> cells was caused by an inhibitory/repressor protein, cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, chx, which has been shown to stabilize several mrnas  <cit> . it was previously shown that chx treatment restored p <dig> mrna levels in cef cells and in immortalized  <dig> and  <dig> murine embryonic fibroblast  cells expressing constitutively low levels of p <dig> mrna  <cit> . we reasoned that a translation inhibitor such as chx should block the function of translation-dependent p <dig> regulatory elements that may be present, resulting in increased p <dig> mrna levels. since primary passage  <dig> cef cells possessed normal levels of p <dig> mrna it was not surprising that chx had no effect on p <dig> expression . however, in cells that contained depressed levels of p <dig> , chx treatment resulted in an upregulation of p <dig> mrna expression . this suggested that both the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells and df- <dig> cells contained a p53-regulatory element that blocked expression of p <dig> resulting in a 5- and  <dig> -fold increase in mrna expression following chx treatment, respectively. removal of this putative p <dig> inhibitor via chx allowed expression levels of p <dig> mrna to increase. however, chx had no effect in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells, which already possessed elevated levels of p <dig> mrna compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells. an examination of the effect of chx on the expression of p21waf <dig> would help substantiate the functional status of p <dig> in the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells. however, treatment with chx had no effect on the expression of p21waf <dig> mrna expression in sc- <dig> cells . this indicates that the p <dig> mrna levels in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells and the chx-restored levels in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were functionally inactive.

thus far, indirect assessment of the functional activity of p <dig> has been demonstrated by measurement of the expression of p53-regulated genes. since the ability of p <dig> to activate or repress transcription of downstream genes is important for cell cycle control, the protein level of p <dig> and the direct functional activity also were measured. unlike the mrna data that showed an increase in p <dig> mrna expression in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells, western blot analysis showed a slightly decreased level of p <dig> protein in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells . to determine whether the protein levels of p <dig> in the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were functional, direct activity was measured after transfection of a p <dig> consensus binding sequence promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid construct. it was discovered that the functional protein activity of p <dig> was  <dig> -fold less than that of primary passage  <dig> cef cells . the functional inactivation of p <dig> protein in the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells likely allowed the cells to escape the growth constraints imposed by p <dig>  in the df- <dig> cells the functional p <dig> activity was greatly decreased compared to the level in primary passage  <dig> cef cells, which is in agreement with the lower mrna expression levels observed in the df- <dig> cells.

expression analysis of genes involved in the rb pathway
another tumor suppressor that plays a fundamental role in controlling cell cycle progression and senescence is rb. alterations in this pathway are second only to alterations in the p <dig> pathway in human cancers  <cit> . surprisingly, an up-regulation of rb expression  was observed in the sc- <dig> cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells . however, this is in agreement with the results of a previous study that showed up-regulated levels of rb mrna in the immortal df- <dig> cell line  <cit> . the up-regulation of rb expression that was observed in all passages of sc- <dig> cells examined may be the result of a functionally inactive p <dig>  as others have shown that rb mrna expression is repressed by p <dig> in mammalian cells  <cit> .

the tumor suppressor p16ink4a, a key regulator of rb that maintains rb in a hypophosphorylated state, is inactivated in many transformed cell lines  <cit> . since p15ink4b assumes the role of p16ink4a in chickens  <cit> , its mrna levels were measured. unexpectedly, only a slight decrease in p15ink4b expression in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells and a significant increase in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were observed. the fact that the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells possessed an increased expression of p15ink4b suggested that the rb pathway may be altered in the sc- <dig> cell line. hypermethylation of the p15ink4b promoter in the sc- <dig> cells is unlikely since it would result in the downregulation of p15ink4b mrna expression, which was not observed in the sc- <dig> cells. it is possible that p15ink4b had been inactivated in the sc- <dig> cells, unlike the df- <dig> cells where hypermethylation of the p15ink4b gene promoter causes the downregulation of p15ink4b mrna expression  <cit> . to determine whether the increased levels of p15ink4b mrna were translating normal protein levels, western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of p15ink4b protein in the sc- <dig> cells. as shown in fig. 4b the p15ink4b protein levels also were increased  in the sc- <dig> cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells.

the p15ink4b alternate reading frame sequence , is encoded by the same genetic locus as p15ink4b, but in a different reading frame, resulting in two completely different genes. the chicken arf gene was recently isolated, and it was determined that chicken arf binds to mdm <dig> and stabilizes p <dig>  just as it does in human and mouse  <cit> . to verify the role of arf in the immortalization process of chicken cells, levels were compared in primary and immortal cef cells. as predicted, the levels of arf were elevated in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells and decreased in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells . although increased expression of arf has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest  <cit> , this was not observed in the passage  <dig> sc- <dig> or df- <dig> cells. it has been shown that e2f- <dig>  directly activates the expression of arf, establishing a link between the rb and p <dig> pathways  <cit> . e2f- <dig> is one of the growth-regulatory genes that is suppressed in senescent human cells  <cit>  and can induce senescence when over-expressed in normal human fibroblasts via arf. this induced senescence is dependent upon the presence of a functional p <dig> gene  <cit> . in the present study, elevated levels of e2f- <dig> were observed in immortal sc- <dig> and df- <dig> cells, which is similar to other immortal chicken cell lines developed in our lab  <cit> . the study by bates et al.  <cit>  proposed that induction of arf by e2f- <dig> would stabilize p <dig> unless there existed a mutation in arf or in p <dig> itself, again supporting our hypothesis that p <dig> was inactive in the sc- <dig> cells.

expression analysis of various cell cycle regulatory genes
since the cell cycle also is regulated by the various cyclins  <cit> , we examined mrna expression levels of multiple chicken cyclin genes . as expected, decreased expression for most of the cyclins was observed in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells. the only cyclin that was up-regulated was cyclin d <dig>  which has been shown to increase its expression in growth-arrested cells  <cit> . in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells, the expression levels of most of the cyclins also were decreased, except for cyclin b <dig>  which had similar levels compared to passage  <dig> cef cells. however, by passage  <dig> the expression of cyclins b <dig>  b <dig> and d <dig> were increased, while the expression of cyclins a, c, d <dig>  and e were decreased compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells. although unexpected, the decreased expression of certain cyclins in the sc- <dig> cells was also found in the fully immortal df- <dig> cells .

telomere regulation
telomerase activation has been shown to be an important step in the immortalization of normal fibroblasts  <cit> . however, in the current study we were unable to show telomerase activation using the trap assay. previous attempts to show telomerase activity in other immortal cef cells  <cit> , including the fully immortal df- <dig> cell line  have proven unsuccessful as well. although telomerase activity was undetectable in the immortal sc- <dig> or df- <dig> cells, telomere length did not decrease, even in senescent passage  <dig> cef cells . these results suggested that perhaps alterations in the p <dig> and/or rb pathways may be more important than telomerase activation for the immortalization of cef cells, which was in agreement with our other spontaneously immortalized cell lines . the question still remains as to how chicken cells maintain telomere length without detectable telomerase activity. it is possible that sufficient telomerase activity is present in immortal cef cells to maintain telomere length, but that this level is not high enough to be detected by the trap assay. it also is possible that telomere length is maintained in cef cells through alternative mechanisms, as has been proposed in a number of human cells lines that do not display telomerase activity  <cit> . although telomerase activity was undetectable, mrna expression of trf <dig>  which is involved in the maintenance of telomeres, was elevated in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells  suggesting that trf <dig> may participate in the stabilization of telomere length in sc- <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike other studies that have introduced exogenous genes into cells in attempt to achieve immortalization or else have characterized a spontaneously immortalized cell line after it had been established, the spontaneous immortalization of the sc- <dig> cell line was analyzed as it transitioned from a life-span extended population of cells into a fully immortal cell line. our results indicated that an initial down-regulation of p <dig> allowed the sc- <dig> cells to bypass senescence. the elevated levels of p <dig> mrna in passage  <dig> sc- <dig> cells were shown to be partially non-functional using the luciferase reporter assay, and also verified by the significantly down-regulated p21waf <dig> expression that was observed. in fact, it has been shown that the loss of p21waf <dig> allowed cells to bypass senescence in spite of p16ink4a expression  <cit> , which is what was observed in the sc- <dig> cells. the inactivation of p <dig>  and consequently p21waf <dig>  likely contributed to the sc- <dig> cells becoming a fully immortal cell line.
