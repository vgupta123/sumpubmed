BACKGROUND
to cooperate towards the execution of a common physiological function , proteins must be localized in the same cellular compartment. there is an involved machinery within the cell for sorting newly synthesized proteins and sending them to their final locations. identifying the destination of proteins in the cell is key to understanding their function. with the existence of many hypothetical proteins and proteins of unknown function, efforts to predict cellular localisation have been a vibrant field of research over the past few years. efforts to identify extracellular proteins, for example, have been fueled by their possible use as therapeutic proteins.

a number of systems have been developed that support automated prediction of subcellular localization of proteins. nakai and kanehisa  <cit>  developed an integrated expert system called psort to sort proteins into different compartments using sequentially applied "if-then" rules. the rules are based on different signal sequences, cleavage sites and the amino acid composition of individual proteins. at every node of an "if-then" tree a protein is classified into a category based on whether it satisfied a certain condition. expert systems using production rules have a rich language for representing biological knowledge but are not well suited for reasoning under uncertainty. they are also unable to learn how to predict on its own and therefore very time consuming to update or adapt to new organisms.

other computational prediction methods are based on amino acid composition using artificial neural nets , such as nnspl of reinhardt and hubbard  <cit> , or support vector machines , used in subloc  <cit> .

targetp of emanuelsson et. al.  <cit>  uses the existence of peptide signals, which are short subsequences of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, to predict specific cell locations. for example, the kdel, skl and sv40-like motifs characterize endoplasmic reticulum , peroxisome and nuclear proteins.

horton and nakai  <cit>  used binary decision tree classifier and the naive bayes classifier to predict the subcellular location for the protein on the basis of an input vector of real valued feature variables calculated from the amino acid sequence. these features were mainly the outputs of different methods for detecting signal motifs and discriminant analysis on the amino acid content.

proloc introduced by xie  <cit>  can be classified as a method combining both amino acid composition and sorting signals. proloc searches also for compartment-specific domains.

as pointed out in  <cit> , many genes are automatically assigned in large genome analysis projects, and these assignments are often unreliable for the 5'-regions. this can result in missing or only partially included leader sequences, thereby causing problems for sequence-motif-based localization algorithms. additionally, proteins which are targeted to the extra-cellular space via non-classical secretory pathways do not possess n-terminal signal peptides.

predictions based only on amino acid composition may lose some sequence order information. chou in  <cit>  proposed the so-called pseudo-amino-acid-composition. trying to incorporate neighborhood information, huang and li  <cit>  introduced a fuzzy k-nn method based on dipeptide composition. the count of occurrences of all 2-gram patterns is a  <dig> dimensional vector, which can be used to represent the protein sequence.

yu et al.  <cit>  proposed a predictive system called cello which uses svms based on n-peptide composition. the authors classified  <dig> amino acids into four groups  to reduce the dimensionality of the input vector.

bhasin and raghava in  <cit>  and sarda et al.  <cit>  used different physicochemical properties of amino acids, averaged over the entire protein or locally. however, such averaged values used as feature vectors for classification with svms do not utilize properly sequence order information.

bickmore et al.  <cit>  concluded that motifs and domains are often shared among proteins within the same sub-nuclear compartment. a novel concept of functional domain composition was introduced by chou and cai in  <cit> .

lockey of nair and rost  <cit>  conducts a similarity search on the sequence, extracts text from homologs and uses a classifier on the text features.

in this paper we propose a method, which uses the primary sequence of a protein for the prediction without employing methods for homology analysis, identification of sorting signals, searching for motifs and domains.

as a base learning algorithm our method uses bayesian classification procedure. this scheme represents each class with a single probabilistic summary. in this paper we propose to use markov chain model for the description of class density. markov chains are broadly applied for analyzing biological sequence data . since in markov chain model the probability of a symbol depends on the previous symbols, we believe that using markov chains to model groups of sequences is the appropriate way to incorporate sequence order information. for the prediction of protein subcellular locations markov chains were first used by yuan  <cit> .

to solve complex classification problems one can use hierarchical architectures, just like linear networks have led to multi-layer perceptrons. we exploit the idea of recursive partitioning, which was widely used in the classification with decision trees. we introduce a recursive algorithm called hensbc which constructs a hierarchical ensemble of markov chains based bayesian classifiers. a hierarchical system called loctree combining support vector machines and other prediction methods for predicting the subcellular compartment of a protein was introduced by nair and rost  <cit> . in contrast to our approach, the structure of the system is predefined by mimicking the mechanism of cellular sorting and using the evolutionary similarities among subcellular locations rather than learned from the data. the problem with this predefined architecture is that a prediction mistake at a top node could not be corrected at nodes lower in the hierarchy.

our approach was also motivated by the idea that ensembles are often much more accurate than the individual classifiers. ensemble methods have gained increasing attention over the past years, from simple averaging of individually trained neural networks over the combination of thousands of decision trees to random forests to the boosting of weak classifiers. adaboost  applied to probabilistic neural networks was used for protein subcellular localization based on amino acid composition in the paper of guo et. al.  <cit> .

our algorithm presents an interesting methodology how the classifiers, learned on different portions of data, can be combined into a powerful system.

RESULTS
in order to demonstrate the encompassing applicability of our novel algorithmic approach to predict subcellular localization, we implemented our algorithm and tested it on disparate sequence datasets, including datasets of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences of reinhardt and hubbard, dataset constructed by huang and li, gram-negative bacteria dataset, sequences of outer membrane and globular proteins, dataset of apoptosis proteins. in this section we will present and compare the overall predictive accuracies and the predictive accuracies for subcellular locations obtained with both procedures – single markov chains based bayesian classifier  and hierarchical ensemble of this classifiers  – for all datasets used in this study. confusion matrices constructed according to the results of hensbc algorithm are provided . we will also compare the results of hensbc with the results of previously published algorithms.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the results obtained for eukaryotic and prokaryotic data. compared to bc, hensbc has managed to improve significantly the predictive accuracies for extracellular and nuclear locations for data_euk. the overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> % achieved with hensbc for eukaryotic proteins is better than  <dig> % achieved by yuan  <cit>  with fourth-order markov chains, is comparable with  <dig> % achieved by hua and sun  <cit>  with svms and is lower than  <dig> % of huang and li  <cit> . the overall result of  <dig> % for prokaryotic proteins is slightly better than  <dig> % of  <cit>  achieved with fourth-order markov chains.

for the results of experiments with dataset of huang and li see table  <dig>  it is interesting, that for this dataset the hensbc was  <dig> % superior than single bayesian classifier. the predictive accuracies for vacuole, cytoplasm, chloroplast, peroxisome and nuclear subcellular locations were improved dramatically. the overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> % is actually the same  achieved by huang and li  <cit>  with fuzzy k-nn method. the only two classes, for which fuzzy k-nn method is superior than hensbc, are extracellular and chloroplast. noticeably, the prediction performance for the smaller sized classes such as cytoskeleton, golgi and vacuole achieved with hensbc is better than that of  <cit> . this implies that our approach gives better chance for the sequences of small classes in such a big dataset.

the confusion matrix for data_swiss  shows that the big part of the misclassification error results from confusing cytoplasmic proteins with nuclear proteins and vice versa. the same fact can be stated for data_euk  and was also observed by horton and nakai  <cit>  for yeast data. confusion of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins is also observed for data_swiss and data_euk. this fact was also noted by guo et al.  <cit> . all these confusions could possibly be considered as an illustration of the idea that some compartments are more similar to each other than others. in the hierarchical system loctree of nair and rost  <cit> , cytosol and mitochondria locations are grouped together into "intermediate" location class cytoplasm, and cytoplasm together with nucleus build "intermediate" location intracellular separated from secretory pathway proteins. the confusion matrix for data_swiss was encouraging in that only a small fraction of extracellular proteins were predicted as proteins sorted to the organelles, e.g. belonging to either of the following locations: endoplasmic reticulum , golgi apparatus, peroxisome, lysosome or vacuole.

since we wanted to compare our results for gram-negative bacteria dataset with previously published, we followed the method of gardy et. al.  <cit>  in evaluating classifier for proteins resident at dual localization sites. for the sequences with dual locations, if one of their locations is predicted, we will consider them as correctly predicted. the results of the experiments using this evaluation method are reported in table  <dig>  the overall prediction accuracy of our method reaches  <dig> %, which is  <dig> % higher than that of psort-b  introduced by gardy et. al.  <cit> , though we do not use specialized algorithms or particular input vectors for each localization site. compared with psort-b, our method gives significantly better predictive performances for all the localization sites except outer membrane proteins . psort-b reaches  <dig> % for omps, however, it utilizes an extra module based on identification of frequent sequences occurring only in beta-barrel proteins. we reach the accuracy of  <dig> % for outer membrane proteins, which is also very high. the identification of omps is of particular interest, because they are on the surface of the bacteria and so are the most accessible targets to develop new drugs against. these surface-exposed proteins are also useful for diagnosing diseases as a means to detect the bacteria.

it is remarkable, that for periplasmic proteins our method reaches the accuracy of  <dig> %, which is  <dig> % higher than that of psort-b.

however, the predictive accuracy of our method is  <dig> % lower than that of cello, reported by yu et. al.  <cit> , and  <dig> % lower than that of p-classifier introduced by wang et. al.  <cit> .

we tried also to consider dual localization categories as separate locations as it is done in the work of horton et. al.  <cit> . the problem therefore becomes a classification task with  <dig> classes. the prediction results achieved with hensbc are reported in confusion matrix of table  <dig> in additional file  <dig>  from the confusion matrix we see that five major locations are good predicted and only a small number of proteins from these locations are misclassified as dually localized. many of the proteins labelled as "cytoplasmic/inner membrane" are misclassified as either "cytoplasmic" or "inner membrane"; labelled as "inner membrane/periplasmic" are misclassified as either "inner membrane" or "periplasmic", labelled as "outer membrane/extracellular" are misclassified as either "outer membrane" or "extracellular". like in  <cit> , we gave partial credit for partially correct predictions as shown in table  <dig>  with this evaluation method we achieved the overall accuracy of  <dig> %.

the results of discriminating outer membrane from globular proteins are shown in table  <dig>  for this binary classification problem we achieved with hensbc the sensitivity  of  <dig> % and specificity  of  <dig> %, which is higher than 84% and 78% reported by gromiha and suwa  <cit> . the more recent work of park et. al.  <cit>  attains the overall accuracy of  <dig> % on a redundancy reduced  dataset of gromiha and suwa  <cit> . the sensitivity of omp prediction achieved in this work is  <dig> %.

CONCLUSIONS
automated prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important tool for genome annotation and drug discovery. here we report the subcellular location prediction method, which make use of the primary sequence information. the method constructs in a greedy top-down fashion hierarchical ensembles consisting of gating markov chain based bayesian classifiers, which gate the protein in question either to the leaf labelled with the output, or to the next classifier.

the employment of markov chain models for the description of class conditional distributions allows to make better use of sequence order and contextual information. the final ensemble can contain multiple probabilistic summaries for each location class, which provide the opportunity of better representing more diverse location classes.

the method can be effectively implemented and is computationally efficient. it demonstrates good results in the empirical evaluation and is competitive with previously reported approaches in terms of prediction accuracies. it outperforms the system psort-b for gram-negative bacteria data, improves significantly previously obtained results for the apoptosis proteins and for discriminating outer membrane and globular proteins.

we believe that our method offer an interesting way of creating well-performing classifiers for very large datasets with skewed class distributions.

because it does not utilize specialized algorithms or particular inputs for localization classes, it can be used for different organisms.

some improvements over the proposed approach are possible. in particular, the application of post-pruning can be investigated.

one possible venue for future research may be to use bayesian classifiers based on variable memory markov models   <cit> .

because the method we propose in this paper need only raw sequence data and can be applied without assuming any preliminary biological information, it bears the advantage of being applicable to various classification tasks in multiple areas of biological analysis. the method could be potentially useful for classification of g-protein coupled receptors , nuclear receptors, enzyme families, analysis of proteins function and prediction of rna binding proteins. our method might become a powerful tool for the analysis of huge amount of sequence data.

the idea of refining the existing classification schemes using multi-level ensembles should be investigated in other applications or integrated with other classification methods in order to verify whether it is generally applicable.
