BACKGROUND
as the sister lineage to seed plants, ferns represent a critical clade for comparative evolutionary studies in land plants  <cit> . in contrast to seed plants, ferns typically retain the ancestral condition for a suite of life history traits . ferns are thus an important outgroup for studying the evolution of wood, seeds, pollen, flowers, and fruit among other economically important characteristics found in seed plants, as well as the evolution of development in these complex structures and the expansion of gene families associated with seed plant evolution . for reasons not yet fully understood, ferns typically have much higher chromosome numbers and larger genomes than seed plants  <cit> .

understanding the factors that influence these differences and their evolutionary consequences will require developing genomic resources in ferns to provide the necessary comparative context to understand the evolution of these traits  <cit> . additionally, because ferns have evolved and maintained free-living and photosynthetic gametophyte and sporophyte life stages, they are an ideal group for studies of life-cycle evolution in land plants and genome function in independent haploid and diploid phases.

among the genomic tools available for non-model organisms, expressed sequence tags  have proven to be a rapid and cost effective strategy to develop sequence markers for comparative evolutionary and functional studies. while taxonomic sampling of plants in genome-scale projects has expanded substantially with dramatic decreases in sequencing cost, and increases in throughput, the development of genomic resources in ferns has lagged far behind those of other plant groups. this deficit has primarily been attributed to technical and economic barriers associated with the complex and large genomes in ferns, but is compounded by the limited agronomic value of most ferns  <cit> . to date , genomic information in ferns is limited to a genetic linkage map  <cit>  and a modest est data set comprised of about  <dig>  sanger cdna sequences  <cit>  for ceratopteris richardii, just over  <dig>  ests for adiantum capillus-veneris  <cit> , and over  <dig>  ests in osmunda lancea  <cit> . fewer than  <dig> ests for pteridium aquilinum have previously been sequenced and deposited in genbank  <cit> .

with the introduction of cost efficient and massively-parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies, genome-scale studies in non-model organisms are being actively pursued for gene discovery, expression profiling, snp and ssr marker development, and studies in functional, comparative, and evolutionary genomics in taxa where little or no previous genomic information exists  <cit> . we chose the roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing technology to sequence a full length enriched normalized cdna library for the gametophyte generation of the bracken fern, pteridium aquilinum  kuhn.

pteridium  is a cosmopolitan fern genus comprised of several closely related species that are well differentiated from other genera in the family. pteridium aquilinum is the most widespread of the bracken species and is distributed throughout the northern hemisphere and africa  <cit> . bracken is notorious as a weed in open fields and is toxic to people and livestock. despite its toxicity, bracken is eaten as a delicacy in several parts of the world, and due to its often high local abundance and large coarse stature, is sometimes used as thatching or packing material. because bracken is common, easily cultured and manipulated, and can have a major economic impact, it has become one of the most intensively studied fern species.

bracken has been used as a model system for the study of the fern life cycle  <cit> , gametophyte development and the pheromonal mechanism of sex determination  <cit> , cyanogenesis  <cit> , carcinogenesis  <cit> , invasion ecology  <cit> , and climate change  <cit> . pteridium aquilinum has a diploid chromosome count of 2n =  <dig> and a total genome size of about  <dig>  gbp  <cit> .

this study was conceived to develop an extensive expressed gene sequence resource in ferns for evolutionary and functional genomics. we present the first comprehensive transcriptome characterization for a fern gametophyte, including an assessment of transcriptome coverage, gene family and functional representation, ssr identification, and a comparative analysis of gene sets across land plants.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
raw roche  <dig> gs-flx titanium reads were quality and adapter trimmed and size selected to yield  <dig>  cleaned reads with a mean length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> mbp of total sequence data . reads were first assembled in mira v <dig> rc <dig>  <cit>  and the resulting assembly was passed through a second assembly step in cap <dig>  <cit>  to join additional contigs . the resulting final assembly consisted of  <dig>  unique sequences . unigenes had a mean length of  <dig>  bp and summed to a total assembly length of  <dig>  mbp . the average read-depth coverage for the final unigene assembly was  <dig> Ã— . the distribution of unigene coverage was highly left-skewed toward low coverage with an extremely long tail . the steep decline in read-depth coverage suggests that cdna normalization was effective and is typical for a normalized library  <cit> .

transcriptome coverage and data quality
because information about the actual size and composition of the transcriptome is often unknown, we utilized a simulation-based tool, estcalc  <cit> , to estimate the expected depth and breadth of transcriptome coverage for this data set. the model for transcriptome coverage backing estcalc was parameterized using the well-characterized arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome and several "next-generation" sequencing runs using normalized and non-normalized cdna libraries  <cit> . using the results from these simulations , our dataset is expected to cover 87% of the nucleotide positions in the transcriptome , with every gene represented by at least one read .

estimates of transcriptome coverage based on simulations modeled using the arabidopsis thalliana floral transcriptome  <cit> .

additionally, 70% of the genes are predicted to be sequenced to 90% of their length. consistent with these estimates, we were able to identify  <dig> of  <dig>  arabidopsis genes that are conserved as single copy genes across all eukaryotes . similarly, we detected  <dig> of  <dig>  shared single copy tribes from arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa, vitis vinifera, and oryza sativa in our classification of unigenes in the planttribes database  <cit> ). these two gene sets  represent a highly conserved subset of genes expected to be present in eukaryotic and plant genomes, respectively, and can be used as a proxy for gene detection and sampling breadth. as a final measure of gene detection in this data set, we utilized a bootstrapped data resampling approach using the distribution of reads in our final assembly  to generate a unigene accumulation curve which plots the number of unigenes detected as a function of sequencing effort . using this method, we estimate that on average 90%, 95% and 99% of the unigenes were tagged after approximately  <dig> ;  <dig> ; and  <dig>  reads were sampled . on average, it took  <dig> reads to detect each of the last ten unigenes.

to identify potential contaminant sequences in the sample or sequencing library, we examined the taxonomic distribution of blastx hits for each unigene searched in the ncbi nr database. we examined both the taxonomic classification of the best hit as well as the lowest common ancestor  assignment for each unigene using megan v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .  <dig>  unigenes had a positive a blast hit, of which only  <dig> % had a best hit to an organism outside of the green plants and  <dig> % received an lca assigned taxon which is not within, or a super set of land plants . we also examined the unigene set for potential genomic dna contamination by screening unigenes for blastn hits to the complete chloroplast genome sequence of pteridium aquilinum . none of the chloroplast sequences identified in the transcriptome were longer than  <dig>  kb or contained more than five adjacent genes  and thus can reasonably be considered putative transcripts  <cit> . that we did not detect any long fragments of chloroplast dna in the transcriptome assembly gives us confidence that our dnase treatment during rna extraction was effective and the resulting cdna library used in sequencing is free of contaminant genomic dna.

unigenes were searched in the ncbi nr protien database using blastx with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  keeping the best ten hits. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   had a positive hit. the lowest common ancestor  assignment for a sequence was calculated using the lca algorithm implemented in megan v <dig>   <cit>  based on at least three blastx hits with a bitscore greater than  <dig> and within 10% of the best bitscore. note: the predicted proteins from selaginella moellendorffii are not currently included in the nr database and thus are not reflected in these results.

functional annotation
unigenes were annotated with gene ontology  terms, enzyme codes, and conserved protein domain functions using the blast2go suite  <cit> . unigenes were first interrogated against the ncbi nr protein database using a blastx e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  keeping the top  <dig> high scoring alignments, resulting in  <dig>  unigenes  with positive blast hits. the best blastx hits for these unigenes corresponded to  <dig>  unique protein accessions in the nr database. the longest open reading frame  from  <dig>  unigenes  had positive matches to conserved protein domains using interproscan  searches implemented in blast2go. these results  were used to assign  <dig>  go terms to  <dig>  unigenes . these go terms were used to map  <dig>  enzyme codes to  <dig>  unigenes. enzyme codes were then used then to retrieve and color  <dig> kegg pathway maps. to assess whether the frequency of functional categories present in the pteridium transcriptome differ significantly from the suite of gene functions present in other plants, we compared the go terms assigned to pteridium unigenes with the go classification for all genes in the arabidopsis thalliana genome  using a two-tailed fdr-corrected fisher's exact test. when using the full go classification, none of the go terms in pteridium are significantly enriched or underrepresented relative to the full go classification for arabidopsis . to examine broad-level classification of gene functions in the bracken transcriptome, we mapped go terms to the go-slim vocabulary  and repeated the fisher's exact test.  <dig> go-slim categories were overrepresented and  <dig> categories were underrepresented in the pteridium transcriptome relative to the arabidopsis thalliana go-slim annotation .

comparative genomics
unigenes were classified into  <dig>  tribe  and  <dig>  orthogroup mcl clusters  in the planttribes gene family database on the basis of the best blastx hit to the inferred protein models of ten complete plant genomes included in an updated version of the planttribes database . to evaluate the level of gene overlap between the pteridium gametophyte transcriptome and other land plants, we examined overlap in both planttribes orthogroup cluster membership and blastx hits for predicted proteins in physcomitrella patens, selaginella moellendorffii, and arabidopsis thaliana . among genes in the arabidopsis genome with positive blastx hits with pteridium unigenes, we examined for the presence of "gametophyte genes" previously identified in the literature. honys and twell  <cit>  used microarrays to identify  <dig>  genes specifically expressed in haploid male gametophyte tissues in arabidopsis, that is, genes consistently expressed in at least one of four male gametophyte developmental stages and absent in six sporophytic tissue gene expression profiles. similarly, yu et al.  <cit>  and wuest et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes  that were significantly over-expressed in female gametophytic cells relative to sporophytic tissues. in total, we identified  <dig>  known arabidopsis gametophyte genes that produced significant alignments with pteridium unigenes in our blastx search .

repetitive sequence characterization
a total of  <dig>  perfect di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide simple sequence repeats  longer than  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> repeats, respectively, were identified in  <dig>  unigenes  using msatcommander  <cit> . sufficient flanking sequences existed to design high quality primers for  <dig> potentially amplifiable ssr loci. pcr primers were chosen using primer <dig>  <cit>  as implemented in msatcommander  <cit>  . since this rna was extracted from gametophytes derived from spores collected from a single diploid sporophyte, we are unable to determine the level of variation present at these ssr loci in natural populations.

to identify and classify expressed repeat sequences, we screened the pteridium unigenes with repeatmasker, using repbase sequences belonging to land plants . in total,  <dig> retrotransposons were identified, representing  <dig> % of the total unigene sequence length . additionally,  <dig> dna transposons were identified, representing  <dig> % of the total sequence length .

discussion
we have used high-throughput sequencing data to characterize the gametophyte transcriptome of pteridium aquilinum, a species for which very little genomic data are available. these data represent an 865-fold increase over the expressed sequence data previously available for pteridium in genbank  <cit> .

assembly quality
because contaminant adapter/primer sequences, polya/t repeats, and low complexity end sequences can substantially compromise de novo assembly and can be difficult to completely remove , we aggressively filtered and trimmed the reads beyond the default instrument-level processing routines at the cost of sequence information loss .

considering the sheer quantity and depth of sequencing produced by next-generation sequencing platforms, we deemed this an acceptable level of loss to improve accuracy in the assembly. we also used a two-step assembly strategy to minimize redundancy in our final unigene sequence set. we adopted this approach because mira is able to handle the large number of reads produced by  <dig> sequencing and utilizes a multi-pass strategy to identify and correct sequencing and assembly errors to produce a highly accurate assembly, but is sensitive to uneven sequencing depth of coverage and allelic diversity, resulting in a high number of redundant contigs. cap <dig> is a proven and efficient dna sequence assembler that can be used to join highly similar overlapping sequences, but is unable to handle the large number of reads produced by new high-throughput sequencing platforms. by combining these two assembly tools, we were able to join contigs and singletons that failed to assemble in mira to reduce sequence-level redundancy in our final unigene sequence set.

in examining the taxonomic distribution of nr blastx hits for the unigenes, we identified only a small proportion of sequences with best blast hits or lca assignments outside of the green plants. when we examine these hits in greater detail, we find that many of them only align to short conserved domains, are hypothetical proteins of unknown function from model organisms, or are genes which are conserved across broad taxonomic levels, such as cytochrome p <dig>  alpha-tubulin and dynein proteins. additionally, because no other fern genomes have been sequenced, some of these sequences may represent novel fern genes. thus, the evidence indicates that there is very little heterospecific sequence contamination in these data.

transcriptome coverage
while the simulations that underlay estcalc are based on the well characterized arabidopsis thaliana floral transcriptome  and assume perfect cdna normalization and sequence assembly, wall et al.  <cit>  show that their results were highly predictive for empirical datasets from diverse eukaryotic species and tissues, making their simulations useful as a null model for predicting transcriptome coverage in other organisms. the predictions for transcriptome coverage produced by estcalc are largely consistent with that observed in our two-step assembly. however, the larger assembly size, greater number of unigenes, and shorter unigene lengths observed in our data set relative to the estcalc prediction may be explained by imperfect cdna normalization or inefficient de novo assembly. additionally, it is also becoming evident that with increased transcriptome sequencing throughput, it is possible to capture a richer, more nuanced, picture of transcriptome complexity   <cit> . this increased information content, however, presents significant challenges for de novo assembly and often results in a fragmented or partially redundant assembly  <cit> . also consistent with the estcalc estimate that we have tagged all of the transcripts present in this sample, our unigene accumulation curve shows that the rate of new unigene detection for this cdna library has declined to the point that additional sequencing is unlikely to detect new genes, but may however serve to condense and join non-overlapping contigs in our assembly. similar approaches to evaluate sufficient sampling in transcriptome projects have been used by other researchers when other information about the transcriptome is absent  <cit> .

functional annotation
the go functional categories represented in the pteridium gametophyte transcriptome are not significantly different from the suite of functional categories present in the full arabidopsis genome go annotation. most of the unigenes annotated with a cellular component are localized to plastids or mitochondria, but a large number of them are also targeted for ribosomes or the plasma membrane . the molecular function of unigenes is heavily dominated by binding nucleic acids or proteins and metabolic activity, including hydrolase and kinase activity . the biological processes represented include all of the major cellular processes from transport and cellular organization to transcription, translation, and metabolism .

visual examination of annotated/colored kegg maps  indicates that we have captured all of the genes required for glycolysis, the citrate cycle, and plant hormone biosynthesis including gibberellin, abscisic acid, strigolactone, cytokinin, brassinosteroid, and auxin. we also detected enzyme code signatures for most of the genes involved in nucleic and amino acid metabolism and chlorophyll biosynthesis.

comparative genomics
the planttribes database contains an objective mcl cluster-based classification system for plant genes and gene families  <cit> . by identifying similar sequences in this classification system, we assigned unigene sequences with putative gene family identities. the most abundant of these gene families present in the unigene set was the pentatricopeptide repeat protein  family, with over  <dig> unigenes classified as ppr proteins. we were also able to identify  <dig> unigenes classified in the mads-box transcription factor family. using this classification, gene sequences from pteridium can be extracted for gene families of interest for use in studies of gene family evolution or phylogenomics. the overlap in orthogroup membership and blast hits for proteins in arabidopsis thaliana, selaginella moellendorffii, and physcomitrella patens is similar , but some striking differences can be observed. in both the planttribes and blast-based venn diagrams, most of the unigenes which were identified in arabidopsis, selaginella, or physcomitrella are also shared across all three species. in the planttribes classification, most of the genes are shared with arabidopsis , the species in this comparison that shares the most recent common ancestor with pteridium, while slightly fewer and approximately equal gene representation is shared with selaginella and physcomitrella . this is in contrast to the blast-based examination of gene set overlap in which arabidopsis again has the greatest number of unigenes with hits , but physcomitrella has hits with  <dig>  more unigenes than selaginella . at first this seems counterintuitive because pteridium shares a more recent common ancestor with selaginella than with physcomitrella. this pattern may be explained by the expression of "gametophyte genes" in pteridium that are conserved with genes in the physcomitrella genome, however little is known about the expression and evolution of genes between sporophyte and gametophyte stages. both physcomitrella and pteridium have maintained a homosporous life cycle with a large independent gametophyte stage. these life history differences may also play a role on the selective pressures and/or constraints influencing gene evolution and more work is needed to address these hypotheses.

in our examination of arabidopsis gametophyte genes, we identified gametophyte-expressed homologs in pteridium for over half  of the previously characterized arabidopsis gametophyte specific or enriched genes. this finding suggests that a highly specific suite of genes required for gamete production and syngamy may be conserved over long periods of evolutionary time, despite substantial differences in life cycle and reproductive strategies between pteridium and arabidopsis. it should be noted also that these conserved genes are not the genes required for meiosis because the tissues sampled in this study and those used to identify gametophyte specific genes in arabidopsis were all post-meiotic. an in-depth study of sporophytic genes in pteridium is needed to better understand the evolution and expression of genes between the sporophyte and gametophyte stages.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first comprehensive sequencing effort and analysis of gene function in the transcriptome of a fern and represents the most extensive expressed sequence resource available in ferns to date, nearly  <dig> times more data than exists for adiantum capillus-veneris. these data are an important new scientific resource for comparative evolutionary studies in land plants and will be of great value for studies of genome structure and function in ferns. these data can be used to develop microarrays for gene expression assays or serve as a reference transcriptome for future rna-seq experiments in pteridium. as additional genome-scale projects in diverse plants are undertaken, these data will be of immense value in representing ferns, the sister clade to seed plants, in comparative genomic analyses.
