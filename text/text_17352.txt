BACKGROUND
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  is the most common chronic liver disorder in industrialized countries with a 20–40 % prevalence worldwide  <cit> . while the milder form of nafld, characterized by simple steatosis  is generally benign, the progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , distinguished by necroinflammation and fibrosis, is linked to an increased risk for the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . the exact pathogenesis of nafld, especially the progression from ss to nash remains unclear but is hypothesized to be triggered by proinflammatory cytokines and intrahepatic accumulation of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol .

epigenetic mechanisms, including changes in methylation patterns or histone modifications, are able to efficiently change the expression of genes by modulating the accessibility of gene regulatory regions by transcription factors  <cit> . studies have repeatedly demonstrated that changes in methylation patterns are able to modify the risk for metabolic diseases, such as e.g. obesity  <cit> , or diabetes mellitus  <cit> . methylation patterns underlie dynamic changes, thus, being suggested to influence disease course and disease severity  <cit> .

three genome wide studies recently elucidated major nafld and nash associated shifts in the methylome and transcriptome and gave first important insights into the genome wide impact of nalfd on these gene regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . ahrens et al. nafld investigated methylation and associated transcriptional changes in liver tissue after bariatric surgery and detected as top hits methylation changes in genes involved in intermediate metabolism and insulin dependent signaling pathways. murphy et al. and moylan et al. demonstrated in two studies that especially progression of nafld leads to the induction of genome-wide occurring changes in methylation and associated changes in the transcriptome, which enables the distinction between mild fibrotic and advanced fibrotic nafld disease stages. comparing patient with mild and advanced fibrosis, the authors showed that key genes associated with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and cancer are significantly modulated in methylation and expression during nafld progress.

no study has to date addressed the question, to what extent nafld is specifically related to epigenetic and transcriptional shifts in gene networks responsible for bile acid  homeostasis and drug metabolism. disease associated changes in the expression of those genes may have relevant consequences for lipid homeostasis, liver function and drug therapeutic efficacy. synthesized from cholesterol, bile acids  are the main source of cholesterol catabolism in humans and are responsible for the intestinal uptake of fat soluble compounds. they are main ligands to the nuclear receptor fxr that has been shown to improve the lipid and glucose profile and has been repeatedly discussed as a putative drug target for the treatment of nafld  <cit> . thus, ba are important regulators of cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. importantly, ba homeostasis is tightly regulated by fxr. fxr is known to control every step in ba synthesis, transport and metabolism . this comprises the conjugation of ba to taurine and glycine and the enterohepatic circulation via several hepatic and intestinal fxr regulated influx and efflux transporters, such as bile salt export pump , apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter , organic solute transporter , the sodium -taurocholate cotransporter protein  and the organic anion transport peptide 1b <dig> . fxr-regulated enzymes, including cytochrome p <dig>  7a <dig>  cyp8b <dig> and cyp27a <dig>  cyp3a <dig>  cyp3a <dig>  sulphotransferase 2a <dig>  and udp-glucuronosyltransferase 2b <dig>  participate in the synthesis and metabolism of bas. imbalances in the composition of the ba pool have the potential to induce and to potentiate hepatotoxicity through pro-inflammatory mechanisms, membrane damage and cytotoxic reactions and may have consequences for lipid homeostasis  <cit> . lake et al. recently demonstrated that the ba composition in nash patients is shifted towards taurine conjugated ba derivatives, which was hypothesized to be caused by observed expression changes in several ba transforming proteins  <cit> . ba homeostasis and drug metabolism  and disposition are closely linked to each other. bas are not only targeting fxr but also other nuclear receptors, such as e.g. pxr and car, thereby impacting the transcriptional regulation of many proteins involved in drug transport and transformation. furthermore, several enzymes and transporters involved in ba homeostasis transport transform therapeutics as well  <cit> . this includes amongst others the hepatic uptake transporters oatp1b <dig> and oatp1b <dig>  the efflux transporters mrp <dig> and mdr <dig> and metabolizing enzymes, such as cyp3a <dig> or ugt2b <dig> 

using three independent nafld cohorts, we specifically address for the first time the question to what extent nalfd shows systematic shifts in the epigenetic profile of genes regulating ba homeostasis and drug metabolism and transport with relevance for the transcriptional expression in both gene networks. in this context we detect and define epigenetic surrogate markers in proximity of the transcriptional start site in two gene networks responsible for ba and dm that are sensitive to nafld and nafld progression and of functional relevance for transcription. the study provides a novel insight into pathogenetic mechanisms underlying a changed ba composition in nafld and the risk for changes in drug metabolism and disposition in nafld, which both may lead to a potentiation of harmful effects on the liver.

RESULTS
nafld is associated with significant methylation changes in genes involved in ba homeostasis and drug metabolism
based on genome wide methylation data measured in three independent nafld cohorts we specifically investigated and compared the methylation profiles of genes associated with ba transport and metabolism  and drug transport and metabolism  between  <dig> nafld patients  and nash ) and  <dig> non-nafld control patients , table  <dig>  fig. 1) using multiple linear regression analyses. for these analyses we specifically included all cpg sites located within the area 1500 bp upstream and downstream from the transcriptional start site  of each gene were taken into consideration. thirty three genes in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig> were significantly differentially methylated between nafld and controls . using multiple linear regression analyses the detected differential methylation of these genes was confirmed in a second independent cohort investigating the methylation state of these genes in dependency of fibrosis severity in  <dig> patients suffering from ss or nash . additional files 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> show all significantly differentially methylated genes and associated cpg sites that were confirmed in the validation cohort. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show an excerpt of the supplemental tables, condensing the list to those genes and associated cpg sites that were later on shown to correlate with gene expression. as demonstrated in  methylation changes related to nafld range from 3 % to 6 % for the majority of cpg sites. especially strong methylation shifts at distinct cpg sites between mild and advanced stages of nafld in genes showing methylation-transcription associations  were observed for slco2b <dig>  ephx , and atp8b <dig>  and for ugt1a <dig>  gstp <dig> , ugt1a <dig> , slc47a <dig>  cyp1a <dig> , sult1a <dig> , cyp1a <dig>  and cyp2c <dig>  . genes harboring cpg sites that were significantly modulated in their methylation profile encode for proteins that belong to all different functional categories represented in both gene clusters as distinguished in table  <dig>  this includes ba synthetizing, modulating, metabolizing and transporting genes, drug metabolizing and transporting genes as well as several important gene regulating nuclear receptors. methylation changes observed in both gene clusters in our targeted analysis are of considerable extent. ahrens et al., describes that the hepatic differential methylation of genome-wide top-hit findings before and after bariatric surgery lies between 5 % and 15 % before and after bariatric surgery  <cit> . murphy and co-workers highlight especially three genes of interest in their genome-wide analyses  that vary between 2 % and 5 % in methylation between mild and advanced nafld cases  <cit> .table  <dig> characteristics of individuals included into the study

we further categorized the strength of nafld dependent methylation changes into three groups. category  <dig> comprises genes with a high nafld dependent impact on methylation in combination with a high cpg site density, i.e. ≥  <dig> cpg sites abundant within the tss <dig> interval, and ≥ 50 % of these sites significantly disease dependently changed in methylation . category  <dig> includes genes carrying  <dig> to  <dig> cpg within the tss <dig> interval with ≥ 50 % of these sites significantly changed in methylation or carrying ≥  <dig> cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval with 30–50 % of these sites significantly changed in methylation . category  <dig> includes all genes carrying <  <dig> cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval and genes with ≥  <dig> cpg sites with < 30 % of these cpg sites affected in methylation .fig.  <dig> schematic overview on genes displaying significant nafld dependent methylation changes in the tss <dig> interval and associated transcriptional changes. genes involved in bile acid homeostasis are shown in the upper panel and genes involved in drug metabolism and disposition are shown in the lower panel. color codes in the left panels indicate the strength of methylation changes in both gene clusters: category  <dig>  defined as ≥ 50 % of cpg islands changed in genes with ≥ <dig> cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval; category  <dig>  defined as ≥50 % of cpg islands changed in genes with  <dig> to  <dig> cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval or 30–50 % of cpg islands changed in genes with ≥  <dig> cpg sites); category  <dig>  defined as <  <dig> cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval or ≥  <dig> cpg islands within the tss <dig> interval and < 30 % of cpg islands changed in methylation. color codes in the right panels indicate the direction of methylation change in dependency of fibrosis  and the direction of association between methylation and transcription . if no association between methylation and transcription was detected field were left white. the majority of methylation-transcription associations were inverse. positive associations and correlations were observed for abcc <dig>  and ugt2b <dig> , for cyp2b <dig>  and for nr2b <dig> . slco2b <dig> showed in the majority of cases fibrosis dependent hypermethylated cpg sites  and was therefore assigned to the hypermethylated targets



genes showing a high nafld dependent change in methylation combined with a high density of cpg sites within the tss <dig> interval  include the transporter genes slc51a , abcg <dig> and slco2b <dig>  the nuclear receptors genes nr2a <dig>  and hnf1α as well as ephx in gene cluster  <dig> . genes with a less strong cpg site density and a considerable significant disease dependent modulation in methylation  include the transporter genes abcb <dig> , slc10a <dig> , abcc <dig> , the enzyme coding genes cyp8b <dig>  cyp3a <dig> and cyp7b <dig> and the nuclear receptors nr0b <dig> , nr1i <dig>  nr1i <dig> and nr1h <dig>  the genes nr5a <dig> , slc27a <dig>  and cyp7b <dig> shall be mentioned within the group of genes only weakly affected in methylation , showing at least  <dig> cpg sites with altered methylation in nafld and a dense tss <dig> associated cpg site composition .

fifteen of  <dig> genes  show considerable significant nafld associated modulations in methylation in gene cluster  <dig> . this includes the genes encoding the drug metabolizing enzymes cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp3a <dig>  cyp2d <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and ugt1a <dig> as well as the drug transporters mrp <dig>  and oat <dig> . in this category we also found erα, cyp1a <dig> and slc47a <dig>  to be characterized by a very dense cpg site composition within the tss <dig> interval and to have at least  <dig> cpg sites associated with nafld-dependently altered methylation. genes showing high nafld dependent modulation in methylation  comprise cyp2e <dig> besides genes coding for hnf4α, hnf1α and cyp2b <dig>  which have been also part of gene cluster  <dig> as a result of their overlapping functional role in both ba homeostasis and dm.

nafld induced hepatic fibrosis is related to methylation changes in ba and dm associated genes
we validated the genes with significant nafld associated altered methylation profile within the tss <dig> interval of clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  using a cohort of  <dig> mild or advanced nafld patients . individuals had been characterized with regard to the severity of hepatic fibrosis in the frame of nafld. multiple linear regression analyses were performed considering demographic data, the percentage of steatosis or stage of fibrosis as putative confounders.

as demonstrated in , the severity of liver fibrosis had a significant impact on the methylation of genes in both clusters. strikingly, the severity of steatosis hardly impacted the epigenetic profile in both gene clusters, allowing the hypothesis that especially nafld associated fibrotic changes appear to be the driving force behind methylation shifts in both gene clusters. interestingly, erɑ, which is characterized by an exceptional high cpg site density within the tss <dig> interval shows epigenetic changes in dependency of both fibrotic and steatotic severity, thus, behaving in this respect discordant in comparison to the other gene targets investigated in gene cluster  <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig> excerpt of nafld associated methylation changes in genes involved in bile acid homeostasis

cpg site methylation impacted by nafld significantly inversely correlates with the transcription of dm and ba genes and respective neighboring genes
to evaluate to what extent the methylation of cpg sites associated with nafld impacts the expression of cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> genes in healthy and diseased hepatic tissue, pearson’s correlation analyses and robust linear regression analyses were performed in a cohort of  <dig> non-nafld and 20-nafld patients  cohort,  <cit> , e-geod- <dig>  fig.  <dig>  table 1), aligning methylation state and level of transcriptional expression inraindividually to each other and taking the fibrosis stage into account. for these analyses genes were separated in disease dependently hyper- or hypomethylated targets, averaging the strength of differentially methylated sites to a representative value for the tss <dig> intervals, which were then investigated in context to transcription.

we found a significant association of methylation with transcription for  <dig> ba homeostasis associated genes , of which nine were hypermethylated and inversely correlated with transcription in nafld . this includes the ba synthetizing and metabolizing genes cyp27a <dig>  ephx and ugt2b <dig>  the ba transporter genes slc10a <dig>  and slco2b <dig> as well as the genes fgfr <dig> and atp8b <dig> involved in ba signaling and bile associated phospholipid transport. the ba transporting protein abcc <dig> and the nuclear receptor nr2b <dig> were hypomethylated in nafld and displayed, in contrast to many other genes, a positive correlation of methylation and transcription. methylation of  <dig> dm associated genes, i.e. the phase i dm genes cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  the phase ii genes sult1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt2b <dig>  gstp <dig> and the transporter genes slc47a <dig>  slco2b <dig> was detected to be significantly inversely associated with the transcriptional expression in gene cluster  <dig> . with exception of gstp <dig>  nr2b <dig> and ugt1a <dig> all genes were hypermethylated in nafld. cyp2b <dig> was detected to display a positive correlation between methylation state and transcription. it is worth noting that inverse correlations between methylation and transcription were especially observed in analyses including liver-healthy individuals and in robust linear regression analyses, taking the severity of steatosis and fibrosis into account. unadjusted correlation analyses within the disease study arm of the ec cohort, which is composed of many individuals with simple steatosis and a low severity state of fibrosis, led only for a few targets to significant results.table  <dig> methylation/transcription correlations of genes involved in bile acid homeostasis in nafld

several genes did not show any significant methylation-transcription associations despite a high cpg site density and a significant variability of methylation observed in nafld. this includes the nafld dependently hypomethylated gene erɑ, and the nafld-dependently hypermethylated genes abcg <dig>  hnf-1α and hnf-4α.

to further validate our findings we investigated to what extent differences in cpg site methylation of those genes, significantly changed in expression and listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  affect the expression of five neighboring genes downstream and upstream of the respective gene targets in gene cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  as demonstrated in , nafld associated differences in methylation of genes in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> had in many cases a significant impact on the expression of neighboring genes as well. the strongest associations between cpg site methylation and gene expression of neighboring genes were observed for the regulatory regions of the genes ephx and fgfr <dig> in gene cluster  <dig> and of cyp1a <dig> in gene cluster  <dig>  showing an association with transcriptional changes of more than  <dig> neighboring genes. these findings further underline the strong impact of nafld associated differences in methylation on regulation of especially those genes.

discussion
in a robust study performing a systematic and targeted analysis in three independent cohorts of nafld patients we demonstrate for the first time that nafld is specifically related to significant changes in the hepatic methylation of genes responsible for synthesis, transport and metabolism of bas, in genes responsible for drug metabolism and transport and in genes regulating the transcription of these gene clusters. we show that the detection of methylation changes at cpg sites within the adjacent 1500 bp interval up- and downstream of the tss are valuable surrogate markers for functionally relevant epigenetic shifts observed in nafld in the investigated gene networks.

several studies show that the interplay of bas and fxr leads to a reduction of triglyceride levels in plasma and inhibits hepatic fat accumulation  <cit> . ba dependent activation of fxr furthermore inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and peripheral insulin sensitivity, which is associated with lower plasma glucose levels as demonstrated in several animal studies  <cit> . we highlight and add especially ostα, slco2b <dig>  ephx, slc27a <dig> and cyp27a <dig>  besides slco10a <dig>  <cit> , to the list of ba homeostasis genes which show disease dependent methylation pattern changes in proximity to the tss that impacts on transcriptional expression. an interesting observation is, that fxr and other nuclear receptors targeted by bas are not significantly differentially methylated in any stages of nafld, allowing the hypothesis that epigenetic changes of ba and dm genes are especially in progressed nafld a major regulatory mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of these genes. the observation that especially fibrosis is strongly associated with methylation shifts of functional relevance in the ba gene network suggests that especially patients suffering from nash may show changes in ba composition and associated consequences for lipid and glucose homeostasis. these observations are well in line with study results published by murphy et al. and ahrens et al., who both observed genome wide methylation shifts especially in patients showing nash associated fibrosis  <cit> . recently, lake et al. compared the ba composition and the transcriptomic profile of genes important for ba homeostasis in nafld patients and liver healthy controls. the authors showed that nafld leads to significant changes in the plasma ba profile, which appears to be based on an activation of the cyp7b <dig> dependent alternative ba synthesis pathway, putatively induced by expression changes of ba synthesizing enzymes, such as cyp8b <dig>  cyp7b <dig> and cyp27a <dig>  <cit> . the nafld related hypermethylation in cyp27a <dig>  as observed in our study, may be at least partly responsible for the expression changes seen for cyp27a <dig> in nafld. an inverse methylation-transcription behavior was, besides for ntcp , also observed for the hepatic uptake transporter slco2b <dig> and the efflux transporter ostα. these observations indicate that the transport of ba in the hepatocyte and from the hepatocyte into the canalicular system might be modulated in nafld. recently, it was demonstrated in vivo that the concentration of circulating plasma ba increases with progression of nafld  <cit> . it would be interesting to test in a future study whether the observed nafld related epigenetic changes are partly responsible for these in vivo effects.

we detected important genes responsible for phase i , phase ii  and phase iii  to show nafld dependent methylation changes that are associated with inverse transcriptional changes. these findings point to consequences for the individual safety and efficacy with therapeutics that are substrates for these proteins in nafld patients. similar to genes involved in ba homeostasis, methylation changes in dm genes are especially observed in fibrotic stages of nafld. we hypothesize that additional modulating effects on dm in nafld are induced by nafld associated shifts in ba composition and concentration that have consecutive effects on nr dependent regulatory pathways. nafld dependent pharmacokinetic studies investigating the in vivo behavior of therapeutics linked to the detected differentially methylated enzymes and transporters have not yet been performed to our knowledge. those studies would be essential to further evaluate the importance of the here observed disease dependent methylation-transcription changes in dm enzymes and drug transporters.

for several genes, such as e.g. hnf1ɑ, hnf4α, abcg <dig> or nr3a <dig> , we did not observe any significant correlations between the strength in methylation and mrna levels, despite the fact that fibrosis dependent changes in the methylation pattern were observed. these genes are linked to a high number of transcript identifiers on the affymetrix gene expression chip, which may result in an unspecific detection signal for the respective mrnas. therefore we do not want exclude that nafld dependent modulations in the methylation of these genes have an impact on the expression of these genes as well.

our study combines samples and data from three different data sets, which allowed for robust detection of nafld dependent methylation shifts in the gene clusters in focus as a basis for subsequent methylation-transcription correlations. we took cpg sites within the tss <dig> into account as it can be assumed that methylation changes within these regions may especially be able to induce changes in the expression of adjacent genes. we defined and validated an epigenetic marker for the methylation state of significantly changed genes based on the average methylation within the tss interval. this procedure is of great value for a robust epigenetic characterization of a gene. it can, however, not be excluded, that cpg sites further distal from the tss may have as well an impact on the expression of genes investigated in the frame of this study.

there are known epigenetic changes in the liver due to changes in lipid and glucose metabolism as well as dna damage and repair, fibrosis and liver tissue remodeling. previous comprehensive genome-wide methylation analyses found changes in e.g. pgc1α, a key transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, has been associated with insulin resistance in nafld patients  <cit> . there has not been, however, a comprehensive assessment performed of the association of nafld with or without changes in lipids or glucose levels and epigenetic changes in genes associated to bile acid or drug metabolism. we, thus, decided to take the known factors impacting strongly on bile acid and drug metabolism into consideration that were available in all three cohorts, i.e. gender, bmi and age. it may be of value to scrutinize in future studies to what extent variations in lipid composition and glucose homeostasis further induce epigenetic shifts in the gene networks investigated. furthermore it will be important in the future to study the relation of methylation and transcription in larger cohorts as soon as available, comprising a larger fraction of patients suffering from nash associated fibrosis, as an epigenetic changes in cpg sites significantly associated with transcription were especially observed in this patient group.

CONCLUSIONS
we were able to demonstrate that the transcriptional expression of genes belonging to the closely related gene networks regulating ba homeostasis and dm is strongly coupled to epigenetic patterns near the transcriptional start site that are significantly shifting in patients with nash associated hepatic fibrosis. these findings add further valuable information on how shifts in the ba profile and ba driven signaling pathways important for lipid and glucose homeostasis may arise in nafld patients and underline the importance for pharmacokinetic studies in patients suffering from nafld.
