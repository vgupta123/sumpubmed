BACKGROUND
the progressive impairment of endothelial function and integrity starts a cascade of events, leading to microcirculation damage, atherosclerosis and common cardiovascular disease , such as coronary heart disease , myocardial infarction , heart failure, stroke and peripheral arterial disease   <cit> . blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells  represent the “promoters” of vascular repair providing the rationale for autologous stem cell therapy  <cit> . the coexistence of multiple classical cvd risk factors negatively influences the number and functional activity of epcs  <cit> . the number of epcs has been reported to negatively correlate with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and aging but not smoking  <cit> . levels of epcs are inversely correlated to progression of coronary heart disease  <cit> . epcs are currently being tested in different clinical settings including repair of damaged microcirculation, regeneration of ischemic tissues, and bioengineering of vascular grafts .

clinically, circulating epcs can be obtained from adult peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood. the number of epcs in adult blood is known to be significantly lower than in cord blood  <cit> . epcs derived from different anatomic locations, just like other somatic stem cells of different sources  <cit> , possess unique biological activities: in vitro phenotypic studies demonstrated that cb-epcs have competitive advantage compared with pb-epcs due to their higher proliferative advantage, as well as better survival rate upon stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . in vivo, tissue-engineered blood vessels generated by peripheral blood- and umbilical cord blood-derived epcs: blood vessels formed by adult peripheral blood epcs are unstable and regress within weeks, while umbilical cord blood epcs form normal-functioning blood vessels that last for more than 4 months  <cit> . thus, umbilical cord blood epcs hold great therapeutic potential for cell therapy and vascular engineering.

the above findings suggest that cb-epcs have enhanced vasculogenic ability compared with adult pb-epcs. however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. epcs from human umbilical cord and adult peripheral blood activate different mechanisms upon high-dose x-ray radiation treatment: cb-epcs undergo p <dig> stabilization, bax-dependent apoptosis and p21-dependent g <dig> and g2/m cell cycle checkpoints, while pb-epcs undergo only radiation-induced senescence  <cit> , indicating unique gene expression patterns in epcs of different sources. another level of regulation may lie on micrornas , which are endogenously expressed small non-coding rnas of 18- <dig> nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression on the posttranscriptional level  <cit> . micrornas have emerged as master regulators of stem cell lineage differentiation and angiogenesis  <cit> . micrornas also play a crucial role in endothelial inflammation, senescence and susceptibility to atherosclerosis: endothelial inflammation is critically regulated by mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mir-10a, and endothelial aging is additionally controlled by mir- <dig> and mir-34a  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which are encoded from the same mirna cluster, modulate the angiogenic properties of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  by targeting c-kit and endothelial nitric oxide synthase   <cit> . in contrast, mirna- <dig> enhances endothelial cell migration and invasion by targeting fat <dig>  a novel breast cancer tumor suppressor  <cit> . mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and the mir- <dig> ~  <dig> cluster  also contribute to pathological angiogenesis  <cit> .

in this study we explored protein-coding mrnas and mirnas involved in epc activities. we found that cb-epcs migrate faster and form tubule structures in vitro more efficiently than pb-epcs do. mrna and mirna levels in epcs of different origins reflect their unique performance.

methods
isolation and cultivation of epcs
all patients gave informed consent, and the study was approved by the research ethics committee of the hsinchu mackay memorial hospital, taiwan . protocols of this study were consistent with ethical guidelines provided in the  <dig> helsinki declaration . epc isolation and characterization were done as described previously with minor modifications  <cit> . in brief, blood mononuclear cells  isolated by histopaque- <dig>  density-gradient centrifugation. mncs  were plated in 2 ml endothelial growth medium- <dig> , with supplementation  on fibronectin-coated six-well plates at 37 °c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. after 3 days of culturing, nonadherent cells were removed. thereafter, the medium were replaced every 2 days, and epcs colonies emerge 2–4 weeks after the start of mnc culture.

epc tube formation, transwell cell migration and cell proliferation assays
a mir- <dig> cdna construct was used in overexpression experiments  <cit> . tube formation assay was performed on epcs to assess their capacity for vasculogenesis, which is believed to be important in new vessel formation. in brief, the in vitro tube formation assay was performed by thawing matrigel at 4 °c overnight, and then placed it in a 96-well plate at 37 °c for 1 h to allow the matrix solution to solidify. epcs were harvested with trypsin/edta, and  <dig> ×  <dig> epcs were placed on matrigel with egm- <dig> medium or serum-free dmem and incubated at 37 °c for 6 h. tubule formation was inspected under an inverted light microscope . four representative fields were taken. for 3d angiogenesis assay, collagen type i acidic solution were mixed with 1/ <dig> volume of basic conditioned medium with  <dig>  ug/ml sdf-1α  and solidify 30 minutes in 96-well plate at 37 °c in a 5% co <dig> incubator.  <dig> cells per well were seeded and assayed.

cell migration ability was evaluated using costar transwell® polycarbonate permeable supports  as previously described  <cit> . the degree of cell proliferation was examined by the mtt assay system  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

mrna microarray and bioinformatics analysis
total rna sample preparation, crna probe preparation, array hybridization and data analysis were done as described previously  <cit> . affymetrixtm hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  whole genome chips were used. rma log expression units were calculated from affymetrix genechip array data using the ‘affy’ package of the bioconductor  suite of software for the r statistical programming language . the default rma settings were used to background correct, normalize and summarize all expression values. significant differences between the sample groups was identified using the ‘limma’  package of the bioconductor suite, and an empirical bayesian moderated t-statistic hypothesis test between the two specified phenotypic groups was performed  <cit> . to control for multiple testing errors, we then applied a false discovery rate algorithm to these p values in order to calculate a set of q values, thresholds of the expected proportion of false positives, or false rejections of the null hypothesis  <cit> . heat maps were created by the dchip software . array data are deposited in the gene expression omnibus  database with an accession number of gse <dig>  part of the pb epc array data were from a public geo dataset gse <dig>  and  <dig> cb-epc data from gse <dig> .

gene annotation was performed by our arrayfusion web tool   <cit> . gene ontology database search were performed by the david  <dig>  bioinformatics resources . the ingenuity pathway analysis  web tool developed by ingenuity co.  was used to construct functional regulatory networks of gene profiles. ipa uses the ingenuity pathways knowledge base to identify known interactions between focus genes and other genes that are not in the gene list. ipa then determines a statistical score for each network according to the fit of the network to the set of focus genes. the score is the negative log of p and denotes the likelihood of the focus genes in the network being found together by chance.

small rna sequencing  and data analysis
total rna was collected and small rna fractions were sequenced by illumina solexa genome analyzer iix  according to manufacturer’s instruction. for data analysis, quality fastq sequences, which were without poly-a, ambiguous nucleotides or a 5’ adapter, yet flanking 6- <dig> nt of 3’ adapter sequence, had the adapter sequences trimmed and the identical sequences were then collapse to unique sequences. the resulting unique sequences that did not align to mrna database  but were aligned to known microrna sequences  were subjected into further quantification analysis. sequencing reads were calculated to obtain a rpkm   <cit>  value as c/lmn x  <dig>  where c = read numbers aligned to given mirna chromosomal region, l = length of mirna, m = multiple mapping numbers across all mirna regions and n = total read numbers that map to human genome sequence. microrna target prediction was done by the mirtar webtool   <cit> .

rna extraction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
rna extraction and reverse transcription were performed as previously described  <cit> . the expression of mature human mirnas was determined by a stem-loop real-time pcr system using the appropriate primer pairs. the universal pcr reverse primer for the mirnas was 5’-gtgcagggtccgaggt-3’. mir-31-specific primers were used  <cit>  and the primer sequences are in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  primer sequences of all other genes and mirnas are also in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the mirna expression data were normalized against the average values of u <dig> snrna, u <dig> snrna and 5s rrna, while the mirna expression data were normalized against the average values of gapdh and beta-actin.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of human epcs from cord blood and adult peripheral blood
epcs were obtained from cord blood or peripheral blood of healthy subjects as described  <cit> . blood mncs that were initially seeded on fibronectin-coated wells were round, and outgrowth epcs with a cobblestone-like morphology similar to mature endothelial cells grew to confluence at days 14- <dig> . cultured epcs were subjected into traswell cell migration assays , tube formation assays , or mtt assays . clearly epcs from cb migrated faster, proliferated faster and formed microvasculature structure more efficient in vitro .

gene expression signatures and functional modules of different epcs
to provide the underlying mechanisms for observed phenotypes, we explored the transcriptome patterns of different epcs. protein-coding mrnas were deciphered first by affymetrix whole-genome microarrays. a total of  <dig> probe sets  q <  <dig> ) were found unique to cb-epc, while another  <dig> to pb-epc . a pca plot using these  <dig> probe represents their differentiating power .

the above gene list gave us a primary insight into the unique composition of differential epcs but reflected little on epc functions. to understand more how gene expression profiles might correlate with epc biology and to provide quantitative evidence, signature probe sets were subjected to gene ontology  database search for finding statistically over-represented functional groups within these genes. given that the whole human transcriptome was represented by the microarray analysis, this analysis was not biased toward the coverage of the microarray. the go categories of the biological processes being statistically overrepresented  among cb-epc genes are presented in figure 2c. the most significant biological process for cb-epcs is cell cycle , especially the mitotic cell cycle . vasculature development genes , especially those involved in angiogenesis , are also significantly higher in cb-epcs . the abundant expression of cb-epc or pb-epc genes were verified by rt-qpcr . a famous tumor suppressor tp <dig> was more abundant in pb-epc, while angiogenic genes angptl <dig> and cdk <dig> in cb-epcs . other related predominant processes include those pertaining to dna damage checkpoint , protein transport , and post-translational protein modification ).

we also subjected cb-epc genes into kegg and ingenuity pathway analysis  database search for disclosing enriched pathways and functional modules. more information was revealed from ingenuity database search. the “g2/m dna damage checkpoint regulation” canonical pathway ranks the no.  <dig> most significant pathway found among cb-epc genes . genes involved in the “flt <dig> signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells” pathway is also overexpresssed in cb-epcs . also enriched in cb-epcs are hif1α  signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling, renin-angiotensin signaling and nfat in cardiac hypertrophy pathways , reflecting the pro-angiogenic nature of cb-epcs. by kegg definition, genes involved in cell cycle are again found significant . database search and functional module assays explain in part why cb-epcs amplification quicker .

unique mirna expression profiles of different epcs revealed by small rna sequencing 
another level of gene expression regulation is through micrornas. to provide a more comprehensive view of transcriptome profiles of epcs from different sources, we determined mirna profiles of different epcs by sequencing the small rna fractions of both epcs. illumina solexa platform generated  <dig>  million high-quality sequence reads for pb-epcs, and another  <dig> million reads for cb-epcs . we constructed an in-house pipeline  for analyzing sequencing data. the initial operations included identifying sequence matches to the mrna database in order to eliminate degraded mrna exon reads. then non-exonic reads that match previously annotated mirnas deposited in the mirbase database  were subjected to normalization and quantitative profiling. the expression of known mirnas were converted into rpkm, and then filtered using a threshold rpkm >  <dig>  a total of  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed between  <dig> epcs, with  <dig> being more abundant in cb-epcs while another  <dig> in pb-epcs . the differential expression of mir- <dig>  mir-18a, mir-10a and mir-26a were verified by rt-qpcr .

applying the genetic network analysis function in the ipa web tool, we searched for mirna-mrna pairs and networks in cb-epcs. pb-epc mirnas, such as mir-10a/b, mir-26a, mir-103a, mir- <dig>  mir-139-5p, mir-151b, mir-361-5p, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were found to be master regulators of a subset of cb-epc protein-coding mrnas . the collective reduction of these mirnas in cb-epcs may explain in part why genes, such as etv <dig> , in this genetic network are more abundant in cb-epcs.

most of the differentially expressed mirnas have not been linked to angiogenesis. mir- <dig> is involved in regulating secretion  <cit> . mir-15a, -20b and - <dig> are reduced in the plasma of type  <dig> diabetes patients, which intend to have poor angiogenesis  <cit> . in vitro, mir- <dig> expression in ecs is upregulated in culture conditions mimicking diabetes mellitus  and ischemia-associated starvation . forced mir- <dig> expression inhibits ec proliferation, migration, and network formation on matrigel  <cit> . mir- <dig> is considerably upregulated after cardiac ischemia and is enriched in cardiac endothelial cells. mir- <dig> induces endothelial cell apoptosis, abolishes endothelial capillary network formation on matrigel, and inhibits cell sprouting from endothelial spheroids by targeting of the stemness transcription factor gata <dig> and the p21-activated kinase pak <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> has an antiangiogenic function by modulating proliferation, tube formation, and sprouting activity of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and functions as an endogenous repressor of the serine/threonine protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin   <cit> . mir-29b can suppress tumor angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis by regulating mmp- <dig> expression in hepatocellular carcinoma   <cit> . micrornas from the mir- <dig> ~  <dig> cluster are known to contribute in pathological angiogenesis  <cit> , and  <dig> out of  <dig> members  were overexpressed in cb-epcs .

mir- <dig> as a novel epc angiogenic mirna
to identify more pro-angiogenic mirnas involved in epc activity, we examined which mirna may contribute in epc angiogenesis. mir- <dig> is a known pro-angiogenic and pro-lymphangiogenic mirna which induce motility in both matured blood vessel and lymphatic endothelial cells  <cit> . knocking down endogenous mir- <dig> levels reduced tube formation and cellular migration abilities in cb-epcs , suggesting a pro-angiogenic role of mir- <dig> in both progenitor and mature type endothelial lineage cells. on the other hand, overexpressing mir- <dig> in pb-epcs helped to recapitulate some of the functions of cb-epcs . over-expressing mir- <dig> in pb-epc or knocking down endogenous cb-epc mir- <dig> level did not affect cell proliferation rate at a significant level in the first 24 hours of transfection . the tube formation and cell migration effects we observed should due to mainly the pro-angiogenic activity of mir- <dig> 

discussion
endothelial cells from the internal barrier of the vasculature, and play fundamental roles in vascular development and disease. the regulation of angiogenesis depends not only on the number of circulating epc but also on their functions  <cit> . aberrant epc activity and the resulting abnormal angiogenesis cause a variety of diseases, such as ischemia, cancer and metastasis. on the other hand, these cells are also potential cell source for cellular therapies aiming to enhance the neovascularization of tissue engineered constructs or ischemic tissues  <cit> . atherosclerotic heart disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. currently, vascular revascularization techniques, including balloon angioplasty and stenting, have been well developed. however, post-angioplasty restenosis substantially limit long-term benefits of heart revascularization procedures. therapeutic progenitor cell transplantation bear potential for organ vascularization regeneration in various pathological states  <cit> . the application of epc in stenting technology during vascular revascularization is the genous epc stent , which is a stainless-steel stent coated with immobilized human anti-cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies that allow the stent surface to "capture" epcs in the blood to accelerate endothelialization of the stent strut. in recent clinical trial, it shows promise result in reducing the risk of stent thrombosis by facilitating rapid endothelialization on stent strut  <cit> .

an increasing number of studies shows that mirnas, or angiomirs, play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of cancer biology, including angiogenesis. manipulating mirnas in the settings of pathological vascularization therefore represents a new therapeutic approach  <cit> . on the other hand, there are still challenges to harnessing epcs for cell therapy. one of these is their rarity , which makes epc isolation challenging. in vitro cultivation and amplification of epcs is therefore required before these cells may be appropriately investigated for use in clinical therapies. however, it is crucial to maintain epc activity during such in vitro manipulation. understanding the basic epc biology will help to develop new biomarkers for monitoring epc activities. in this report, we identified epcs, especially those from cord blood, exploit several cellular genetic groups and mirna pathways to regulate their angiogenesis activities. transcriptome information will eventually help to develop new clinical applications as mentioned above.

when pb-epc genes were subjected into go database search, we found these genes are enriched in both wnt receptor signaling  and positive regulation of i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascade . genes involved in the induction of apoptosis are also more abundant in pb-epcs . kegg and ipa database search also revealed that genes involved in both wnt signaling  and mapk  pathways are more abundant in pb-epcs . ipa analysis also revealed the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be more active in pb-epcs . the wnt signaling system regulates vascular patterning in the developing embryo  <cit> . it has recently been documented that wnt <dig> is a proangiogenic molecule of human endothelial progenitor function, and increases blood flow to ischemic limbs in a hgf-dependent manner  <cit> . our work further supports a crucial role of wnt pathway in adult epcs, and wnt proteins may be therapeutically deployed to increase blood flow and angiogenesis in adult ischemic tissues.

in this study we applied rna sequencing  technology, instead of microrna chips, for deciphering epc mirnomes. this is due to the fact that microarray application in mirnome research has several limitations, including hybridization and cross-hybridization artifacts, dye-based detection issues and design constraints that preclude or seriously limit the detection of newly discovered mirnas or previously unmapped, novel mirnas  <cit> . these issues have made it difficult for standard array designs to provide full sequence comprehensiveness  or transcriptome comprehensiveness . studies using this method have already altered our view of the extent and complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes  <cit> . rna-seq has also delivered a sharp rise in the rate of novel microrna discovery in the current mirbase r <dig> release , which is the primary online repository for all microrna sequences and annotation.

one of the cb-epc-dominant micrornas is mir- <dig>  a pro-angiogenic mirna that enhances endothelial cell migration  <cit> . mir- <dig> has recently been documented as a signature bec mirna that negatively regulates lymphatic endothelial cell identity and lymphatic vascular development by targeting prox <dig>  a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of lymphatic lineage-specific differentiation  <cit> . in the present study, we further showed that mir- <dig> is a dominant mirna in cb-epcs, and its overexpression is crucial for epcs to possess superior angiogenic ability . unmasking the roles of small rna-mediated gene regulation in epc activity will be crucial and will provide new insights into regenerative and reparative medicine. we envision that our report will serve as a resource for future mirna studies that aim to improve understanding of the various regulatory ultimately modulating epc and ec activities.

for mirnas more abundant in pb-epcs, mir- <dig> modulates endothelial cell senescence via silent information regulator  <dig>   <cit> . the levels of mir- <dig> and let-7e are higher in the myocardial microvascular endothelial cells  in type  <dig> diabetic goto-kakizaki  rats, which have impaired angiogenesis  <cit> . mir- <dig>  member of the mir-106b ∼  <dig> cluster , in tumor cells possesses oncogenic and angiogenic activities  <cit> . both microrna-125a-5p and mir-125b are overexpressed in pb-epcs , and their role in inhibiting endothelin- <dig> expression in vascular endothelial cells has been reported  <cit> . mir-10a regulates a proinflammatory phenotype in athero-susceptible endothelium in vivo <cit> . the collective effects of these mirnas in epc biology are still awaited to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results reveal a series of differentially expressed mirnas and protein-coding genes that have not previously been associated with epc biology. this study therefore provides a road map for future mechanistic studies of epc migration and microvasculature formation, which should eventually help to improve our understanding of angiogenesis, and will also benefit the development of new therapeutic approaches that target the inhibition of pathogenic angiogenesis in tumors, the stimulation of angiogenesis in patients with cardiovascular diseases, stroke or diabetes.
