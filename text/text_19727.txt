BACKGROUND
autism spectrum disorder  is characterized by impaired reciprocal social interactions, delayed or aberrant communication, and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors, frequently with restricted interests  <cit> . these disabilities often confer significant lifelong burdens on individuals with asd. this fact, together with the high asd prevalence in the general population, makes asd a major challenge for public health systems.  based on heritability estimates as high as 70- 90 % in twin and family studies  <cit> , great effort has been devoted to elucidating the genetic mechanism of asd. however, it has been difficult to identify any individual genetic factors that confer even moderate risk  <cit> .

genome-wide association studies  have implicated the region on chromosome 5p <dig>  between cdh <dig> and cdh <dig> as the first potential common genetic risk factor for asd in caucasian populations  <cit> . replication in independent gwas, however, has frequently not been achieved for many candidate loci for asd . phenotype and genetic heterogeneity between patients are conjectured to greatly reduce the power of overall genome-wide case-control studies in asd, and is a likely explanation for the lack of replication and much of the ‘missing heritability’ in this complex disease  <cit> . various attempts have been made to reduce heterogeneity in large-scale genetic studies of asd. one proposed approach to increase statistical power to detect pathogenic loci is to design genetic association studies focusing on asd sub-phenotypes .

restricted and repetitive behaviors  are a core symptom of asd  <cit> . previous studies have shown that rrb have an underlying genetic component and may be influenced by genes independent of those associated with the social or communication deficits . moreover, autism diagnostic interview-revised , a gold-standard diagnostic tool for asd  <cit> , provides widely-accepted quantitative measures for rrb  <cit> , making it a promising sub-phenotype for association studies. since rrb comprises heterogeneous groups of behaviors  <cit> , research during the last decade has used factor-analysis to examine the structure of rrb using different subsets of adi-r items and subpopulations of asd individuals that differ in symptom severity and/or ethnicity . remarkably, in spite of their methodological differences, many of these analyses converge on a two-factor solution for rrb comprising ‘repetitive sensory-motor’  and ‘insistence on sameness’ . the rsm subcategory quantifies motor mannerisms, sensory seeking behaviors, and the repetitive use of objects, whereas the is subcategory quantifies compulsions, rituals and difficulties with changes in routine  <cit> .

is and rsm were found to be differentially related to other asd variables. specifically, high correlations were found between rsm, but not is, with iq, additional adaptive behaviors, and age at first words and phrases  <cit> , suggesting that, compared to is, rsm may be more correlated with asd severity  <cit> . studies also indicated that the is subcategory might be under stronger additive genetic control than the rsm subcategory. whereas significant familial aggregation of the is subcategory has been consistently reported  <cit> , no significant concordance for familial aggregation has been reported for rsm  <cit> .

behavioral subcategories that differ in behavioral correlates and familiality are of particular interest to researchers investigating the genetic components that underlie asd sub-phenotypes. in a recent genome-wide linkage analysis  <cit> , rsm and is subcategories were linked to various chromosomal regions that only partially overlapped regions previously identified using asd diagnosis as the phenotype.

in the current work, we explored the underlying structure of rrb using two independent, publicly available asd datasets. in an effort to identify snp markers, candidate genes and biological pathways associated with rrb, the empirically derived rrb subcategories were then used as quantitative traits for gwas. the observation that both univariate and multivariate linear mixed models identified associated snps within 8p <dig> - <dig>  in the discovery dataset, provides the first evidence that genetic variation in this region influences rrb phenotypes in asd. further studies are needed to confirm the association signals within chromosome 8p <dig> -8p <dig> , since replication was not obtained in an independent sample of  <dig>  asd probands, possibly due to insufficient sample size and between-study heterogeneity.

methods
ethics statement
this study was approved by the ethics committee of the school of basic medical, fudan university, china . all the genetic data and phenotype data used is previously published and publicly available. written informed consent was previously obtained from all individuals and procedures had approval from institutional review boards from all the institutions involved in recruitment and research, following national and international ethical and legal regulations and the principles of the declaration of helsinki.

dataset demographics
the discovery dataset comprised individuals in the autism genetic resource exchange family-based dataset   <cit> . agre has obtained informed consent from all individuals listed in their pedigree catalogue. individuals with asd in the agre cohort were diagnosed using both the autism diagnostic interview-revised   <cit>  and autism diagnostic observation schedule   <cit> , widely considered to be the gold-standard diagnostic instruments for asd. individuals with possible non-idiopathic asd  were excluded. all subjects were genotyped using the illumina humanhap <dig> beadchip. genotyping details and other important information have been previously described  <cit> . a “cleaned” version of the raw agre genetic data, designated chop.clean <dig>  was downloaded from the agre website . following the method described in the supplement section of the study by wang et al.  <cit> , population structure was examined based on the first two principal components obtained by multidimensional scaling  of a matrix of pairwise ibs  values between these individuals. individuals of european ancestry were selected based on principal component  <dig> scores less than  <dig> , and principal component  <dig> scores between - <dig>  and  <dig> . a total of  <dig> asd families  were inferred to have european ancestry using the above procedure . because adi-r record were available only for asd probands rather than for all pedigree members, the final discovery dataset comprised  <dig>  probands, ranging in age from  <dig>  to 44 years , and were predominately male . the sample size of each computer-scored diagnostic group defined by agre was: autism  <dig>  , not quite autism   <dig> , and broad spectrum   <dig> . the specific criteria for these classifications are given on the agre website. detailed information for all individuals can be found in additional file  <dig> 

the dataset used for replication comprised individuals in simons simplex collection , a genetic study limited to families with one child with asd . previous reports have described the ssc data collection process, as well as the extensive phenotypic data available  <cit> . informed consent was obtained at each data collection site included in the ssc. our group obtained phenotype and genotype data for  <dig>  asd families, from which  <dig>  probands with adi-r records were selected for analysis, these probands ranged in age from  <dig> to 108 years , and were predominately male . the sample size of each diagnosed status defined by adi-r was autism:  <dig>  , and autism spectrum disorder :  <dig> . detailed information for all the individuals can be found in additional file  <dig> 

diagnostic instruments
the autism diagnostic interview-revised  instrument is a standardized parent interview designed to assess the presence and severity of symptoms based on the dsm-iv criteria for asd  <cit> . items designed for interviews fall within three diagnostic categories: i) social, ii) communication and iii) restricted and repetitive behaviors. two scores are given for most items: a ‘current’ score, which assesses behavior during the past 3 months, and an ‘ever’ score, which assesses behavior in early childhood or at its greatest severity. we used the ‘current’ score in each item to avoid potential retrospective bias that could result from using the ‘ever’ score. the full range of each item scores  was used to provide maximal information of severity. scores of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  given under certain circumstances were all converted to  <dig>  according to the algorithm listed in adi-r  <cit> .

genotype imputation
imputation of genotypes for autosomal snps was performed using impute version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the reference panel used was the  <dig> genomes phase i integrated haplotypes, which were produced using shapeit <dig>  <cit>  and released in june  <dig> . imputed snps with low imputation quality  or minor allele frequencies  < 5 % were excluded.

statistical analysis
pca analysis of rrb items
factor analysis was carried out using principal components analysis  with varimax rotation on  <dig> rrb items from the adi-r using r  <cit> . these items were previously included in the rrb subdomains, rsm and is by s. l. bishop and colleagues using exploratory factor analysis  <cit> . similar to previous factor analyses of the adi-r  <cit> , we employed a cutoff of  <dig>  for the inclusion of an item in a factor. correlation analyses were conducted to examine relationships between rrb subcategories.

assessment of familiality of rrb subcategories
to investigate potential familial relationships in the empirically derived subcategories, intraclass correlations  between sibling pairs with any asd diagnosis  from the multiplex families were calculated   <cit> . affected sib pairs of each multiplex family were included in iccs calculation . this analysis was only done using the agre dataset, since ssc was limited to families with only one asd child.

genome-wide association analyses
the association of snps with the rrb subcategories was measured using a novel genome-wide efficient mixed-model association  approach developed by zhou and stephens  <cit> . briefly, gemma fits univariate linear mixed models for associations with single phenotypes or multivariate linear mixed models for simultaneous associations with multiple phenotypes, while controlling for sample relatedness and potential population stratification. . gemma was downloaded from http://www.xzlab.org/software.html. raw item scores from adi-r score sheets of asd probands were summed for each subcategory of rrb identified by pca analysis. sex and age at adi-r standardized residuals of the summed scores of each subcategory were calculated using multivariate regression. these residuals were normalized following tukey’s formula using spss and then used as phenotypes in genome-wide association analysis. autosomal chromosome association results were retained  <cit> . first, associations between snps and each subcategory were tested using the gemma program based on a univariate linear mixed model, while applying a correction for sample structure  through a pairwise relatedness matrix derived from snp genotypes. second, the gemma program was used to investigate associations between snps and rrb sub-categories in a multivariate analyses model to estimate the robustness of the associations. the use of multivariate methods has been recommended, because multivariate analyses may increase power not only to detect genetic variants that affect only one of the multiple correlated phenotypes, but also pleiotropic genetic variants .

following association analysis, statistical evidence for association was evaluated by carrying out genome-wide association analysis for  <dig> permutations of phenotypes. to ease the computational burden, these analyses were performed for genotyped snps only. to estimate genomic inflation factors for all the distributions of p-values, lambda genomic control  values were calculated as the ratio of the median of the empirically observed distributions of the test statistic to the expected median. the empirical p-value for the original association was calculated as the proportion of permutation replicates with lambdagc values greater than the lambdagc value of the original distribution.

cis-eqtl analysis for the candidate loci
expression quantitative trait loci  analysis was conducted using gene expression data obtained using adult human prefrontal cortex obtained from the “braincloud” study   <cit> . only individuals of european ancestry  were included in the analysis. individual-level mrna expression data were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus  and genotype data were obtained from dbgap  linear regression models were used to identify snps located within 500 kb of the transcript being tested  with statistically significant correlations between genotype and mrna expression levels, with rna integrity numbers  and age included as covariates. genotype imputation for chromosome regions of interest was performed as described elsewhere  <cit> .

functional enrichment analysis
to identify plausible pathways associated with rrb, we expanded our focus beyond single variants by performing functional enrichment analysis using the web-accessible bioinformatics tool, database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit> . since david can only handle gene lists, snps with an association p-value smaller than  <dig>  were used to compile a list of genes for further analysis . analysis was performed using the software’s functional annotation clustering option. the“functional annotation clustering” tool identifies gene annotation terms that are enriched in the input gene list compared to the gene list from entire human genome and ranks the terms according to their enrichment p-values calculated using fisher’s exact test. subsequently, “clusters”of related gene annotation terms that are enriched in the input gene list are assigned an “enrichment score” , defined as the geometric mean of the log10-transformed p-values for all gene annotation terms in the cluster. enrichment scores >  <dig>  are considered to be nominally significant.

familiality of rrb
to test potential familial relationships between sibling pairs in our data, we calculated interclass correlations  between sibling pairs for rsm and is and the original rrb domain from adi-r. a significant family genetic effect was shown for is , while the icc for rsm was  <dig>   and the icc for rrb was  <dig>  .

genome-wide association analysis
after filtering for minor allele frequency  < 5 % and info score r2 <  <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> genotyped or imputed snps were tested for association with standardized and normalized rsm , is , and rsm/is  scores using gemma mixed model association analyses. quantile-quantile  plots of p-values for association with is or rsm in the agre cohort gwas are shown in fig.  <dig>  qq plots of p-values for association with rsm/is and permuted rsm/is phenotypes are also shown, with the true distribution compared to the permuted distributions . the true lambdagc value was  <dig> , while the permutation p-value for rsm/is association result was  <dig>  based on the distribution of lamdagc values obtain from all permutations analyzed . these results suggest little evidence for inflation of p-values due to stratification or other confounding biases, but provide compelling evidence for rrb association. the manhattan plots for associations of snps with rsm、is or rsm/is quantified using gemma are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> quantile-quantile plots of p-values for association with is, rsm or rsm/is in the agre gwas cohort. q-q plots compare log10-transformed observed p-values  to log10-transformed p-values expected under the null hypothesis of no association . a and b q–q plots obtained for association of gwas snps with rsm or is based on a univariate linear mixed model. c for associations of gwas snps with rsm/is based on a multivariate linear mixed model, qq-plots of the true association statistics for genotyped and imputed snps are shown in red, genotyped snps only in blue,  <dig> phenotype-permutated replicates in gray. d the true lambdagc value  is shown as a red vertical line and the distributions of lambdagc values from  <dig> phenotype-permutated replicates is shown as a histogram

we failed to detect genome-wide significant associations  with rsm or is in the agre cohort. however, rs <dig> at 11q <dig> showed an association signal close to genome-wide significance for rsm  and ten snps at this locus had p-values below  <dig> e- <dig>  all located within 20 kb upstream from il10ra , table 3). the strongest univariate association signals for is were detected at 8p <dig> -8p <dig> , including the top  <dig> significant snps/rs <dig> , rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> , located within 10 kb downstream of the stmn <dig> gene , table 4). several other regions showing suggestive association signals  for rsm or is were also detected, such as 1q21-1q <dig>   and an intron on ensa ), 6p <dig>  ) . these regions cannot be easily implicated in rrb, but may still provide new insights, if confirmed in follow-up studies with larger samples or sequencing validations.table  <dig> list of the most significant associations with rsm  in the agre cohort

for rsm/is, the top-ranked snps were identified within 8p <dig> -8p <dig> , completely overlapped with the most highly associated region for is , table 5). as shown in regional plots of association signals , association with 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  region snps is greater for rsm/is than for is or rsm, suggesting that the multivariate model including rsm and is might provide greater power for detecting associations. since no significant family genetic effect was detected for rsm in our analysis, association in the multivariate association analysis was likely driven by the is category. it should also be noted that this region did not show any significant association with asd diagnosis after we re-analyzed the association for this region in agre cohort following the earlier analysis  <cit>  . based on these observations, we focused subsequence analyses on the 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  region and hypothesized that common variants in this region may be novel candidate loci for rrb, especially is.table  <dig> list of the most significant associations with rsm/is  in the agre cohort

replication  dataset
based on pca of  <dig> adi-r scores in the ssc dataset, we identified the same two rrb subcategories, rsm and is, observed in the agre dataset . however, no statistically significant signals were detected for association with rsm、is or rsm/is in gemma univariate or multivariate analysis of 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  region snps. the top-ranked snp rs <dig> for rsm/is with p-value  <dig>  is located in an intron of ptk2b . the lack of association in the ssc dataset may be caused by between-study heterogeneity. ssc probands included in present analysis are from simplex families, in contrast to 90 % of the probands in the agre cohort who are from multiplex families. thus, the relatedness might increase the power for association analysis in agre sample. an additional source of heterogeneity comes from the age distributions of the probands in these two dataset, for which the sample means are significantly different .

although the associations we reported for 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  were not observed in ssc dataset, previous observations provide biological plausibility for the contribution of chromosome 8p and 8p <dig> -p <dig>  to asd. chromosome 8p is known to harbor numerous genes implicated in developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and asd  <cit> . in the largest schizophrenia linkage analysis to date, the 8p <dig> -p <dig>  region was found to be associated with schizophrenia   <cit> . in a subsequent publication, the same group reported significant associations for snps in and around dpysl <dig> and adra1a, 8p <dig> -p <dig>  region genes previously associated with schizophrenia in family-based and case-control association studies  <cit> ; the strongest associated snp  is located 377 kb from the top signal in our analysis   <cit> . recent meta-analyses of cnv and gwa studies results suggest that there are both clinical and biological links between autism and schizophrenia  <cit> , so it is highly plausible that common variants in this region contribute to both asd and schizophrenia. significantly, a subset of schizophrenia patients display multiple repetitive behaviors  <cit> .

genomic features of the 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  region
the snp showing the most significant association for rsm/is, rs <dig>  has a p-value just shy of genome-wide significance . in addition, twenty-four snps in the same region have p-values for association smaller than 5e −  <dig>  including the top associated snp for is  and three genotyped snps  that are in linkage disequilibrium with the top three snps . together, these  <dig> snps span a 117 kb region that contains three genes: stmn <dig>  trim <dig> and ptk2b. stmn <dig>  interacts directly with microtubules, causing a switch from a straight to a curved conformation that has been proposed to promote rapid microtubule depolymerization. according to the braincloud study database , stmn <dig> mrna is highly expressed in both fetal and adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex    <cit> , consistent with a role in early neuron development  <cit> . ptk2b  encodes a major focal adhesion kinase that plays a key role in neuritogenesis and neurite elongation  <cit> . because all the top snps are located in non-coding gene regions, we hypothesized that these snps are linked to genetic variants that regulate the expression stmn <dig> or ptk2b.

expression quantitative trait locus  analyses using adult ceu prefrontal cortex
with the aim of exploring the molecular basis of the observed associations with rsm/is, we investigated whether our top snps or their proxies  associate with gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  using expression and genotype data of  <dig> healthy adult ceu individuals. top snps and multiple proxy snps in or near stmn <dig> showed nominally significant association between genotype and stmn <dig> mrna expression , with the strongest association represented by rs <dig>  at a p-value of  <dig> . none of the snps were associated with the expression of ptk2b mrna. since expression data in braincloud dataset were from adult human brain, it is possible that the genetic variants regulate ptk2b mrna expression only in the developing brain.

bioinformatic evaluation
we queried the regulomedb database  <cit>  to assess whether any of the  <dig> snps that associated with the rsm/is sub-phenotypes  are located in known or predicted regulatory elements, including regions of dnase i hypersensitivity, binding sites for transcription factors and promoter regions that regulate transcription. two snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  received regulomedb likelihood scores of 1f . both of these variants, which are located within an intron of ptk2b, associated with expression of bnip3l mrna in a lymphoblastoid cell line and located within dnase i hypersensitivity peaks.

functional enrichment pathway analysis
in total,  <dig> genes linked to snps with nominal associations  with rsm/is in the multivariate analysis of the agre cohort were selected for enrichment analysis using david . using the david functional annotation clustering tool, we identified  <dig> annotation term clusters with enrichment scores >  <dig>  , including two clusters containing pathways crucial for brain development and function . cluster  <dig> contained several pathways previously implicated in the pathogenesis of asd, including neuron development   <cit> , neuron projection development   <cit>  and axon guidance . cluster  <dig>  contained several cell-adhesion pathways, which have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders  <cit> .

as a negative control, we also carried out david-based enrichment analyses using candidate gene lists derived from association analyses of  <dig> sets of permuted rsm/is phenotypes . among  <dig> annotation term clusters with enrichment scores greater than  <dig>  that were obtained for the ten gene sets, only one was related to the brain/neuron development . these results suggest that the gene list derived from the original, non-permutated association is enriched in brain and plausible asd-related pathways. because no enriched annotation term cluster identified in present study survived correction for multiple testing, however, the possibility of false-positive enrichments cannot be excluded.

discussion
in this work, analysis of adr-r rrb item scores in the agre and ssc datasets confirmed the existence of two previously identified subcategories in the rrb domain, rsm and is. gwas of rsm and is subcategory scores based on univariate and multivariate mixed models identified common variants within 8p <dig> -8p <dig> as possible susceptibility locus for rrb in the agre dataset, but not in the ssc dataset.

univariate association analysis identified different association patterns for is and rsm, including signals at 1q21-1q <dig> 、6p <dig> 、11q <dig> and 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  that have not previously been reported for association with rrb. several regions in 15q have previously been linked to rsm or is in linkage analysis, including 15q <dig> -q <dig> , 15q <dig> -q <dig>  <cit>  and 15q11-q <dig>  <cit> . our analysis failed to detect suggestive associations for rsm or is at these loci, although a suggestive association with is was detected for the 15q <dig>  region snp rs <dig> . lack of replication may reflect difference in populations and/or methodology, i.e., linkage vs. association analysis.

common variants within chromosome 8p <dig> -8p <dig> , a locus previously linked to schizophrenia, approached genome-wide significance for rsm/is and were also the top signals for is in univariate association analysis. since many genetic variants linked to asd have a high degree of pleiotropy , it is reasonable that some genetic variants contribute to both rsm and is and were detected with higher association magnitude using multivariate association model  <cit> . although the associations we reported for 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  were not observed in the ssc dataset, we should mention that a partial trisomy of 8p has been identified in a 6-year-old female with autism  <cit> . this region is also included in a large  chromosome duplication identified in a patient with autism and self-mutilation  <cit> . this patient presented with abnormal behaviors, including ritualistic behaviors, self-injury and temper tantrums, consistent with the hypothesis that this chromosomal region contains a dosage-sensitive gene that contributes to rrb phenotypes.

our top snps and multiple proxy snps in or near stmn <dig> were identified as eqtls for stmn <dig> in human prefrontal cortex, and it is plausible that stmn <dig> influences rrb domain phenotypes by modulating neuron development and dendritic microtubule dynamics  <cit> .

furthermore, based on mrna expression data from two public databases  <cit> , our top snp, rs <dig>  and several proxy snps correlate with expression of bnipl <dig>  a gene located almost  <dig> kilo base pairs upstream . since long-range regulation of mrna expression by genetic elements located as far away as  <dig> mbp, has been previously described  <cit> , in principle, this gene may also be considered a candidate for rrb. although bnipl <dig> has not previously been reported to be associated with asd, it encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that is required for mitochondrial clearance and has been proposed to play a role in hypoxia-induced autophagy  <cit> . recent research  <cit>  has shown that children and adolescents with autism have high dendritic spine density in the brain and this excess is due to a defect in dendritic spine “pruning,” a process essential for normal brain development  <cit> . the same study also showed that the abnormal spine pruning is caused by a defect in autophagy in neurons  <cit> . mitochondria localize in both pre- and postsynaptic department , and mitophagy is crucial for brain development and dendritic spine pruning  <cit> .

ptk2b has been widely studied since it was identified as a novel alzheimer’s disease  candidate gene in a large meta-analysis of ad gwas  <cit> . ptk2b kinase, a major focal adhesion kinase, regulates the integrity of focal adhesions, which are major compartments for integrating signals for cell growth, apoptosis, and neuron migration, cellular functions essential for normal brain development  <cit> . since several neuronal cell-adhesion genes have been identified in rare asd cases  <cit>  and a gwa study has shown that neuronal cell-adhesion molecules may be collectively associated with asds  <cit> , it is plausible that ptk2b contributes to asd through its roles in regulating integrity of focal adhesions.

because the terms in each enriched cluster identified by the pathway analysis did not survive multiple testing correction  using the benjamini-hochberg method), we could not identify specific biological pathways that contribute to the development of rrb in asd. however, david analysis included ptk2b among the top three enriched terms in cluster <dig>  based on its function in focal adhesion formation and regulation of adherens junction dynamics by phosphorylation switches  <cit> , providing evidence that ptk2b is a plausible candidate gene for rrb.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies of rrb subcategories using data from an agre asd cohort enabled the detection of associated snps at 8p <dig> -8p <dig> . this region contained  <dig> genotyped or imputed snps with p-values for association with rsm/is < 5e- <dig>  with the top snp  just missing genome-wide significance. notably, 8p <dig> -8p <dig> has previously been linked to schizophrenia and our top snps are located in close proximity and/or correlate with the expression of several genes with plausible connections to asd and rrb. because association signals in this chromosome region were not detected in the ssc asd dataset, however, more work will be required to validate the possible contributions of common variants in 8p <dig> -8p <dig>  to rrb or asd.
