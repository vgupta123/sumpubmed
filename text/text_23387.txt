BACKGROUND
nuclear hormone receptors  are transcription factors that work in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate gene expression  <cit> . most of the nhrs in vertebrates are ligand-activated, although some nhrs function in a ligand-independent manner. examples of ligands for nhrs include a range of endogenous compounds such as bile acids, retinoids, steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and vitamin d. a few nhrs, such as the pair of xenobiotic sensors, pregnane x receptor  and constitutive androstane receptor , are activated by structurally diverse exogenous ligands. nhrs share a conserved domain structure, which includes, from n-terminus to c-terminus, a modulatory a/b domain, the dna-binding domain , the 'hinge' d domain, the ligand-binding domain , and a variable c-terminal f domain that is absent in some nhrs  <cit> .

nhrs show varying degrees of sequence conservation across vertebrate species in the lbd that likely reflects, at least in part, cross-species variation in the physiologically important ligands. the xenobiotic sensors pxr and car show extensive cross-species amino acid sequence divergence across vertebrate species  <cit>  in addition to evidence of positive  selection in the lbd from phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . cross-species differences in xenobiotic ligands are a possible driving force for changes in the lbd sequence and structure. we and others have also provided data consistent with the hypothesis that the structure of the lbd of nhrs in the nr <dig> h and nr1i subfamilies may have co-evolved with the endogenous ligands in some species in evolution  <cit> .

bile salts are one class of nhr ligands that show substantial cross-species differences in chemical structure  <cit> . bile salts are amphipathic, water-soluble end-metabolites of cholesterol that facilitate intestinal absorption of lipids, enhance proteolytic cleavage of dietary proteins, and exert antimicrobial activity in the small intestine  <cit> . bile salts exhibit significant structural diversity across vertebrate species  <cit>  and include bile alcohols  and bile acids    <cit> . primary bile salts are defined as those synthesized by the liver, which is accomplished by a complicated biosynthetic pathway that starts with cholesterol  <cit> .

secondary bile salts result from modification of primary bile salts by host bacteria in the intestine  <cit> . common alterations in bile acids catalyzed by enzymes from anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract include deconjugation and dehydroxylation, with one possible end result being unconjugated and poorly water-soluble bile acids such as lithocholic acid , a compound known to be toxic to mammalian species including humans  <cit> . there have been few studies of intestinal bile salts in animals that utilize bile alcohols, but one study of the asiatic carp  showed that the bile alcohol sulfates synthesized in the liver of this species did not undergo hydrolysis in the intestinal tract and thus did not generate potentially toxic unconjugated secondary bile alcohols  <cit> .

variation in the stereochemistry of the junction between rings a and b of the bile salt steroid nucleus determines whether bile salts have a flat  or a 'bent' orientation. based on surveys of the bile salt composition in  <dig> vertebrate species, we have proposed that 5α  bile alcohols are the likely ancestral ligands  while 5β  bile acids are the derived  phenotype  <cit> . common 5β-bile acids include chenodeoxycholic acid  and cholic acid , the two dominant primary bile acids in humans and other mammals   <cit> .

pxrs are activated by a structurally diverse array of endogenous and exogenous molecules that includes bile salts, steroid hormones, prescription medications, herbal drugs, and endocrine disruptors  <cit> . pxr regulates the transcription of enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism and elimination of potentially harmful compounds, including sulfation of toxic bile acids  <cit> . previous studies have shown substantial cross-species differences in pxr ligand specificity, including in the selectivity for bile salts  <cit> . mammalian pxrs are activated by a broad range of bile salt structures , while chicken  and zebrafish  pxrs are activated by a structurally narrow range of bile salts  <cit> . we and others have proposed that the evolution of pxrs has been driven by at least two factors: adaptation to evolutionary changes in bile salt  structure and function as a xenobiotic sensor  <cit> . compared with published x-ray crystallographic structures of human pxr  <cit> , a homology model of the zebrafish pxr is predicted to have a smaller ligand-binding pocket  than human pxr, with a flat ligand-binding surface well-suited to binding the planar 5α-bile alcohols that are the primary bile salts of zebrafish and other cypriniform fish  <cit> .

fxr serves as the major transcriptional regulator of bile salt synthesis, in part by controlling the expression of cytochrome p <dig>  7a <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway  <cit> . mammalian fxrs are activated best by primary bile acids cdca and ca  <cit> . fxr is typically expressed at high levels in the liver, intestine, kidney, and adrenal glands. a second fxr, termed fxrβ , is found in some animal species  but does not appear to be involved with bile salt binding or regulation  <cit> . throughout this manuscript, fxr refers to nr1h <dig>  or what might be termed fxrα in species possessing two fxrs.

the african clawed frog  expresses an unusual fxr  that has a  <dig> amino acid insert, not found in mammalian fxrs, in helix  <dig> of the ligand-binding domain   <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that sea lamprey , zebrafish, and african clawed frog fxrs are activated by bile alcohols  <cit> . sea lamprey and zebrafish fxrs are selective for planar 5α bile alcohols. the xenopus fxr isoform  <dig> was activated by 5α- and 5β-bile alcohols  but was poorly activated by bile acids  <cit> .

the vitamin d receptor  is known to mediate the action of  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d , a hormone whose 'classic' function is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. however, vdrs are now known to be involved in a wide range of physiological processes including immune system modulation, skin development, and regulation of the metabolism of toxic compounds  <cit> . two vdr genes have been found in the genome of many actinopterygian fish   <cit> , with vdrα and vdrβ both shown to be functional in the japanese medaka   <cit> . mammalian vdrs are activated at low affinity by a narrow range of 5β-bile acids, particularly the toxic secondary bile acid lca and its derivatives  <cit> . vdr activation in the intestine has been shown to upregulate the expression of enzymes  that can metabolize and reduce the toxicity of lca  <cit> . we previously determined that the vdr from the sea lamprey  was insensitive to activation by a wide array of bile salts, including bile acids and bile alcohols with a range of substituents. we proposed the hypothesis that activation of vdrs by bile acids is a 'derived' trait, possibly as an adaptation to evolutionary changes in bile salt pathways and vertebrate physiology that allow for generation of toxic secondary bile acids  <cit> .

in this report, we characterize the ligand selectivity of fxr, vdr, and pxr from the green-spotted pufferfish , an actinopterygian fish that synthesizes mainly the 5β-bile acids ca and cdca  <cit> , thereby having a bile salt profile similar to most mammals. we also cloned and characterized vdrs from three additional non-mammalian species: medaka, african clawed frog, and chicken . in terms of primary bile salts, the medaka synthesizes a mixture of 5β c <dig> and c <dig> bile acids  <cit> . the african clawed frog has a complicated mixture of c <dig> and c <dig> bile alcohols, c <dig> bile acids, and c <dig> bile acids in its bile  <cit> . the chicken synthesizes mainly ca and cdca as primary bile salts  <cit> .

we generated homology models of tetraodon fxr  and pxr  using rat fxr  <cit>  and human pxr  <cit>  crystallographic structures, respectively, as templates. we then performed computational ligand docking experiments to these receptors. this allowed for comparison to the structures of the corresponding mammalian receptors, helping to formulate hypotheses to rationalize the structural changes that have occurred during receptor evolution. additionally, we build on our previous docking studies with bile acids and human vdr  and expand structure-activity series of bile acids at this receptor. combining information from docking experiments and cross-species sequence comparisons, we generated site-directed mutations and chimeras to better understand the molecular determinants of bile salt activation of vdrs.

RESULTS
bile salt profile of tetraodon nigriviridis
we previously reported a survey of the biliary bile salts of  <dig> fish species from  <dig> different orders  <cit> . included in this survey were six species from tetraodontiformes, an order of actinopterygian fish that includes tetraodon nigriviridis. the primary bile salts from all six species of tetraodontiformes examined were the common 5β-bile acids ca and cdca. this is illustrated in additional file  <dig> by high-performance liquid chromatography  and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry  . the primary bile salt pool of tetraodon is quite similar to that of many mammals  and birds  <cit> .

ligand selectivity of the tetraodon fxr
analysis of the draft genome of tetraodon nigriviridis revealed a single putative ortholog to human fxrα  and another single putative ortholog to human pxr . we did not find any evidence of an ortholog to fxrβ in the tetraodon genome. the lbds of tnfxr and tnpxr were cloned and functionally expressed as gal4/lbd chimeras . tnfxr was activated most strongly by gw <dig> , a synthetic ligand known to activate mammalian fxrs with high efficacy  <cit> , and activated weakly by t- <dig> , an agonist of mammalian liver x receptors , fxrs, and pxrs  <cit> . conjugated and unconjugated 5β bile acids also activated tnfxr, including cdca, tauro-cdca, 3-oxo-lca, and lca . the ec <dig> of bile acids for activation of tnfxr ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, with maximal effects varying from 15-61% of that produced by gw <dig> . the planar bile alcohol 5α-cyprinol sulfate  weakly activated tnfxr. a 76-compound library of known nhr ligands was screened for additional activators of tnfxr. this screening identified three activators of tnfxr in addition to bile acids which included two farnesol derivatives  and 6-formylindolo--carbazole.

ligand selectivity of the tetraodon pxr
with respect to bile salts, tnpxr had similar structure-activity relationships to tnfxr, namely activation by 5β-bile acids with one or two hydroxyl groups on the nuclear rings . unlike tnfxr, tnpxr was not activated by gw <dig> or farnesol compounds. tnpxr was also activated by a variety of androstane, estrane, and pregnane steroids, similar to pxrs from mammals, chicken, and zebrafish   <cit> . tnpxr was not activated by several xenobiotics known to be agonists of mammalian pxrs including hyperforin , nifedipine , rifampicin, and sr <dig>  but was activated by n-butyl 4-amino benzoate, an agonist of xenopus laevis pxrs  <cit>  .

structure-activity relationship of bile acids for activation of human and mouse vdrs
expanding on previous studies from our group  <cit>  and others  <cit> , we determined the structure-activity relationships of naturally occurring and synthetic bile acids for transactivation of gal4/lbd constructs of hvdr and mouse vdr . lca and derivatives  activated both hvdr and mvdr . iso-lca, with a single 3β-hydroxy group on the steroid rings , weakly activated hvdr and mvdr. in contrast, naturally occurring 5β-bile acids with two or three hydroxyl groups on the nuclear rings were inactive including cdca , dca , and ca . we also tested three 5β-bile acids not known to occur naturally in bile that have a single hydroxyl substituent on the steroid rings on a carbon other than c- <dig> , as well as unsubstituted 5β-cholanic acid . all four of these bile acids were inactive with respect to activation of hvdr and mvdr. thus, bile acids with hydroxyl groups at the c- <dig> or c- <dig> position are unfavourable for activation of hvdr . unsubstituted 5α-cholanic acid, which would have an overall planar orientation of the steroid rings, weakly activated hvdr and mvdr. two 5α-cholanic acid derivatives  were inactive .

activation of non-mammalian vdrs by bile salts
the african clawed frog vdr  was not activated by any bile salts tested, including bile alcohols. in contrast, chicken vdr , medaka vdrα , tetraodon vdrα , and zebrafish vdrα  were each activated by lca and/or its derivatives  but not by bile acids with two or more hydroxyl groups such as cdca, dca, or ca . the efficacies of lca, 3-oxo-lca, and lca acetate  for activation of chicken, medaka, tetraodon, zebafish vdrs were lower than for hvdr and mvdr .

structure-directed mutagenesis experiments
we previously used molecular modelling computational docking studies to understand the structural basis of bile acid activation of hvdr and mvdr  <cit> . these studies predicted an electrostatic interaction between arg- <dig>  and the bile acid side-chain, and a hydrogen bond between the 3α-hydroxyl group of lca and his- <dig> in helix  <dig> . this hydrogen bonding brings lca close to the activation helix  <dig> where lca forms hydrophobic contacts with val- <dig> and phe- <dig> that would stabilize the helix in the optimal orientation for coactivator binding. site-directed mutagenesis by adachi et al. supported this conclusion and indicated that alteration on this arg residue of hvdr  significantly disrupted the receptor response to lca  <cit> . additional file  <dig> displays the surface around the ligand binding pocket of hvdr, showing that it is predominantly hydrophobic in the middle with more polar features on its ends.

we next performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments to confirm the docking model of the bile acid to vdr, and to try to rationalize the cross-species differences in activation of vdr by bile salts. these mutations were performed in mvdr, which generally has higher maximal activation by bile acids but shows a similar selectivity for bile acids to hvdr. three residues, previously identified by the hvdr docking model as key to bile acid activation - arg- <dig> , his- <dig> , phe- <dig>  - were mutated individually to two other amino acid resides. this produced a total of six-directed mutants: r269a, r269e, h392a, h392y, f417a, and f417d.

we also made site-directed mutations at amino acid positions that showed differences between vdrs that are bile acid-sensitive  and bile acid-insensitive . these mvdr mutations changed the amino acid residue in mvdr to the corresponding residue found in the bile-salt insensitive vdrs: q286e , s <dig> d , s293g , n <dig> d , n319k , and rcr363-365lck , rcr363-365riq , rcr363-365acr  . lastly, we also tested the role of the h1-h <dig> 'insertion' domain in mediating bile acid activation. thus, we generated hvdr that lacked amino acid residues 165- <dig>  and an hvdr construct where the insert domain was replaced with the insertion domain from the bile acid-insensitive xlvdr . the analogous constructs were also created for xlvdr: one lacking the insertion domain  and the other with the insertion domain from hvdr .

the two mutations at arg <dig>  reduced the apparent affinity of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> by over two orders of magnitude and abolished activation by lca and 3-oxo-lca. similar effects were produced by the two mutations at his <dig>  which reduced the apparent affinity of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> by approximately 10-fold and 100-fold, respectively, and abolished activation by lca and 3-oxo-lca. the two mutations at phe <dig>  both reduced the apparent affinity of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> by approximately two orders of magnitude while retaining activation by lca and 3-oxo-lca but not lca acetate. interestingly, unsubstituted 5α-cholanic acid activated the r269a, r269e, h392a, h392y, f417a, and f417d mutants weakly.

in general, the mutations at glu- <dig>  ser- <dig>  asn- <dig>  and arg/cys/arg  had little effect on activation by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> or bile acids compared to wild-type mvdr. similarly, the four constructs that involved either deletion  or swapping of the h1-h <dig> insertion domain  had little effect on activation by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> or bile acids compared to wild-type hvdr. thus, the h1-h <dig> insertion domain does not appear to play a major role in selectivity for bile acids.

pharmacophore models for tetraodon vdr, pxr, and fxr
using the structure-activity data for tnvdr, tnpxr, and tnfxr , we developed common features pharmacophore models for these three receptors . the tnvdr pharmacophore, mapped onto  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> in figure 7a, has four hydrophobes and two hydrogen bond acceptors. the tnpxr pharmacophore, mapped onto taurochenodeoxycholic acid in figure 7b, shows three hydrophobes and one hydrogen bond acceptor, a smaller pharmacophore than that determined for hpxr  <cit> . the tnfxr pharmacophore, mapped onto gw <dig> in figure 7c, shows four hydrophobes, one hydrogen bond acceptor, and one negative ionizable feature.

homology modeling of tetraodon pxr
structural studies of the lbd of hpxr reveal a large , roughly spherical, hydrophobic lbp with the flexibility to accommodate large molecules such as hyperforin and rifampicin  <cit> . we can also see this by surface analysis of the co-crystallized ligands that cover a molecular weight range of 273- <dig> da and a calculated alogp  range of  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . the homology model we generated of the lbd of tnpxr showed an lbp predicted to be slightly smaller  compared to hpxr , but larger than the estimated volumes of homology models of the lbps of zebrafish pxr  and xenopus laevis pxrα  that we reported previously  <cit> . the homology model results for tnpxr are consistent with the pharmacophore model for this receptor described above .

we performed molecular docking studies with two steroids  and one bile acid  that activated tnpxr in the luciferase assays . docking studies show that the two steroids bind similar to the published crystallographic structure of 17β-estradiol bound to hpxr  <cit> . the carbonyl group of pregnanedione or hydroxyl group of androstanol at the c- <dig> position has a hydrogen bond with thr- <dig>  which corresponds to ser- <dig> in hpxr. for pregnanedione, the carbonyl group at c- <dig> forms another hydrogen bond with gln- <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  molecular docking indicated that the electrostatic interactions between cdca and the conserved arg- <dig> residue on helix  <dig> are important for binding to tnpxr. the hydroxyl group at the c- <dig> position forms a hydrogen bond with glu- <dig>  which is different from tnfxr, for which a his residue is involved in hydrogen bonding. for tnpxr, tyr is in the position of this his residue, and adopts a different side-chain rotamer orientation to provide van der waals contacts with the hydrocarbon scaffold of cdca.

homology modeling and docking studies of zebrafish pxr  <cit>  show an important amino acid sequence difference . this residue is located at the bottom of the pxr lbp and has direct van der waals contacts with a-ring and b-ring of the hydrocarbon scaffold of bile salts, specifically the methyl group at the c- <dig> position. in zebrafish pxr, the bulky and more rigid benzyl side-chain of the phenylalanine significantly narrow this portion of the zebrafish pxr lbp compared with human pxr which has the flexible side-chain of methionine- <dig>  which may lead to preference for planar bile alcohols by zebrafish pxr. tnpxr has valine at the position corresponding to methionine- <dig> in human pxr, which allows enough room for either bent or planar formations of the a/b ring of bile salts.

homology modeling of tetraodon fxr
for the homology model of tnfxr, molecular docking studies show that gw <dig> adopts a similar orientation in the structural model as in the hfxr crystal structure  <cit> . the carboxyl group of gw <dig> forms a strong electrostatic interaction with the conserved arg residue in helix  <dig> of tnfxr. in addition, extensive hydrophobic contacts occur between the di-chloro-substituted benzyl ring of gw <dig> and residues in helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of tnfxr, which would stabilize the active conformation of receptor. cdca also activated tnfxr in our experiments, but with weaker activity compared with its activity in hfxr. sequence alignment indicated that most of the ligand contact residues identified in the crystallographic structure of hfxr  <cit>  are conserved between tnfxr and hfxr. however, one important hydrogen bond interaction between the c- <dig> hydroxyl group of cdca and hfxr is not present for tnfxr because tyr- <dig>  in helix  <dig> is substituted for by phe in tnfxr.

there is an opening to solvent for the fxr lbp as seen in crystallographic structures of human or rat fxrs  <cit>  and our homology models . the width of this opening is mostly controlled by two residues - met- <dig> and ile- <dig> in human fxr. for tnfxr, the residue corresponding to hfxr ile- <dig> is alanine. our model suggests that the lbp of tnfxr has a wider opening to solvent than hfxr, which may explain how tnfxr and not hfxr can accommodate cyprinol 27-sulfate, a c <dig> bile acid that has a longer side-chain and more hydroxyl groups than cdca. the pharmacophore model for tnfxr summarized in figure 7c is consistent with the homology modelling and docking results, in having multiple hydrophobic interactions, a hydrogen bond acceptor, and negative ionizable features for the bound ligand.

discussion
in this study, we characterize the fxr, vdr, and pxr of the green-spotted pufferfish tetraodon nigriviridis, an actinopterygian fish that synthesizes mainly 5β-bile acids. this bile salt profile is similar to humans and most mammals, as well as many other actinopterygian fish, some reptiles, and some birds  <cit> . we find that the fxr and pxr of tetraodon  are activated by common bent-shaped 5β-bile acids such as cdca and less well by planar 5α bile alcohols, matching the endogenous primary bile salt profile of this species.

our experimental and molecular modelling studies of tnfxr reveal a receptor that differs in multiple respects from sea lamprey and zebrafish fxrs  <cit>  but is instead more similar to medaka fxrα  <cit>  and mammalian fxrs. homology modelling of tnfxr predicts an lbp with a wide opening to solvent  and an overall architecture that differs markedly from homology models of sea lamprey and zebrafish fxrs, which are both predicted to have narrow lbps that can accommodate planar bile alcohols but cannot accommodate bent bile acids such as cdca. docking studies of lamprey and zebrafish fxrs predict good binding to planar 5α-bile alcohols but not to bent 5β-bile acids, a prediction that is consistent with reporter assay experiments  <cit> . for tnfxr, docking studies show that the fxr-selective agonist gw <dig> and bile acid cdca adopt orientations in the lbp similar to those observed in the crystallographic structures of gw <dig> bound to hfxr  <cit>  and rat fxr bound to an analog of cdca, respectively  <cit> , lending further support to the conclusion that tnfxr has an overall lbp structure more similar to human and rat fxrs than to sea lamprey or zebrafish fxrs.

tetraodon fxr has similar ligand selectivity to medaka fxrα , including strong activation by gw <dig> and the primary bile acid cdca   <cit> . given that the activation of medaka fxrα upregulates the transcription of genes important in bile salt synthesis and transport, including the genes for cyp7a <dig> and bile salt export protein as well as the nhr repressor small heterodimer partner   <cit> , tetraodon fxr seems likely to also be involved in regulation of bile salt biology. tetraodon fxr and medaka fxrα have a substantially different ligand selectivity from sea lamprey fxr, which is not activated by gw <dig>  cdca , or t- <dig>  <cit> . this is not surprising because the primary bile salts of the sea lamprey  are quite different from those of tetraodon  and medaka   <cit> . the fxrs of tetraodon and medaka also differ significantly from an fxr cloned and characterized from the little skate , which was found to be insensitive to bile salts, even the 5β-bile alcohols  produced by the little skate and many other cartilaginous fish  <cit> . however, the skate fxr showed significant differences in sequence from other vertebrate fxrs, including novel insertions, and there is the possibility that this receptor is actually orthologous to mammalian fxrβ , which are activated not by bile salts but instead by other steroidal compounds such as lanosterol  <cit> .

homology modelling of tnpxr predicts a receptor with an lbp with a volume  significantly larger than the estimated volumes of the lbps of zebrafish pxr  and xenopus laevis pxrα   <cit>  but smaller than the lbp of hpxr in crystallographic structures  <cit> . the homology model and docking studies of tnpxr are consistent with our studies of recombinant tnpxr in luciferase reporter assays that show activation by a wider range of ligands than can activate either zebrafish or xenopus pxrs. for example, tnpxr is activated by a broad range of 5β- and 5α-bile salts and steroids similar to hpxr. in contrast, studies of recombinant zebrafish pxr show activation by a narrow range of planar 5α-bile alcohols  <cit> . the pharmacophore model for tnpxr is similar to models of hpxr  <cit>  which have four hydrophobic features along with a hydrogen bond acceptor, although the tnpxr pharmacophore had three hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond donor, consistent with a somewhat more restricted lbp limited to smaller ligands than hpxr  <cit> . like hpxr, tnpxr has a pharmacophore model markedly different from that of chicken and zebrafish pxrs  <cit> .

overall, the ligand selectivity of tnfxr and tnpxr contrasts with that of sea lamprey fxr, zebrafish fxr, and zebrafish pxr, which are activated better by 5α bile alcohols, which are the main bile salts of jawless fish  and cypriniformes   <cit> . unlike lampreys and zebrafish, tetraodon nigriviridis has a bile salt profile of mainly bent 5β-bile acids such as cdca, and would thus be predicted to have bile-salt-regulating nhrs that can recognize tetraodon endogenous bile acids and not the 'ancestral' bile alcohols that comprise only a trace fraction of the tetraodon bile salt pool. these results lend further significant support to the hypothesis that structural changes to the lbd of fxr and pxr throughout evolution have paralleled cross-species changes in bile salt profile  <cit> . in additional file  <dig> bile salt variation and nhr bile salt sensitivity are overlaid on a fish phylogeny. so far, only a limited number of fish species have been characterized with respect to their fxrs, vdrs, and/or pxrs. as discussed in additional file  <dig> a number of fish groups would be of particular interest for future studies of nhrs, including the elasmobranchii , chimaeriformes , myxiniformes , and lobe-finned fish .

our present and previous studies  <cit>  with vdrs from various non-mammalian species have revealed some vdrs that are insensitive to bile acids  and others that are activated by secondary bile acids such as lca . in humans and some other mammals, enzymes from anaerobic bacteria in the caecum deconjugate and dehydroxylate primary bile acids such as cdca, leading to secondary bile acids such as lca that can produce toxicity to the intestinal and hepatobiliary tracts  <cit> . we and others have speculated that the ability of vdrs to bind secondary bile acids was acquired during vertebrate evolution as a protective mechanism against the potential toxicity of poorly water-soluble secondary bile acids such as lca  <cit> . one challenge to this hypothesis is that there has been little study to date of the secondary bile salts  of non-mammalian species. for example, it is not known whether tetraodon or other actinopterygian fish species have physiologically important amounts of secondary bile acids in the intestinal tract. with these caveats in mind, we summarize our studies of vdrs across different species.

the structure-activity and molecular modelling data are both consistent with a tight, hydrophobic binding pocket for bile acids in the human vdr lbp that can bind bile acids with an oxo or single hydroxyl group at the c- <dig> position but not bile acids with substituents at the c- <dig> or c- <dig> positions . molecular modeling predicts an hvdr bile acid binding pocket that is predominantly hydrophobic but with polar features that permit hydrogen bond interaction with the 3α-hydroxy or 3-oxo group on the a ring of the bile acid and electrostatic interactions with the bile acid side-chain as described above. bile acids that have hydroxyl groups on steroid rings b and/or c  do not interact favourably with the more hydrophobic and sterically constrained portion of the hvdr bile acid binding pocket, consistent with the lack of activity of these bile acids in transactivation assays. on the contrary, the unsubstituted and hydrophobic b, c, and d rings of lca complement well the lipophilic portion of hvdr pocket and can form numerous van der waals interactions. we suggested that the unique physicochemical arrangement of the hvdr ligand binding cavity provides the structural basis for selective activation by lca and its derivatives  <cit> .

it is less clear, even with our mutagenesis studies, exactly what changes mediate the cross-species differences in vdr pharmacology. our studies rule out the helix  <dig> - helix  <dig> 'insertion' domain as playing a role in the cross-species differences in activation by secondary bile acids. this insert is disordered in human and mouse vdrs and shows highly variable sequences and lengths across species  <cit> . our site-directed mutagenesis experiments do confirm the previous prediction that arg- <dig> and his- <dig> play a key role in interacting with bile acids  <cit> . interestingly, arg- <dig> and his- <dig> are conserved in the bile salt-insensitive xlvdr, indicating that other determinants underlie the differences in bile salt pharmacology between xlvdr and bile-salt responsive vdrs.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies provide further important evidence of the relationship between fxr, pxr, and vdr ligand selectivity and cross-species variation in bile salt profiles. zebrafish and the green-spotted pufferfish tetraodon nigriviridis provide a clear contrast in having markedly different primary bile salt profiles  and correspondingly contrasting receptor selectivity that matches the differences in endogenous ligands. in contrast, tetraodon has a bile salt profile and receptor ligand selectivity similar to humans. our observations present an integrated picture of co-evolution of bile salt structure and the binding pockets of three nuclear hormone receptors.
