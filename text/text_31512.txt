BACKGROUND
protein phosphatase 2a  is a multifunctional serine/threonine phosphatase found in all eukaryotes that regulates a host of cellular processes  <cit> . it is composed of a core heterodimer consisting of a structural a subunit and a catalytic c subunit  <cit> , which further complexes with regulatory b-type subunits to form heterotrimeric pp2a holoenzymes. the b-type subunits direct pp2a to specific signaling complexes and subcellular locations  <cit>  and regulate the activity of the c subunit towards different substrates . while there are only two isoforms of the a and c subunits , there are several families of b-type subunits . in addition to these three families of b-type subunits, the striatin family of scaffolding proteins , and zinedin) represents a possible fourth family of pp2a b-type subunits in that they bind pp2a a/c heterodimers in the absence of other b-type subunits  <cit>  and alter the activity of the bound pp2a a/c heterodimer  <cit> .

striatin family members serve as molecular scaffolds that organize large signaling complexes. striatin, sg2na, and zinedin contain multiple protein-binding domains: a caveolin-binding domain  <cit> , a coiled-coil domain  <cit> , a ca2+-calmodulin-binding domain  <cit> , and a wd-repeat domain  <cit>  . consistent with the presence of these domains, striatin family members have been reported to associate with calmodulin in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit>  and with caveolin- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, striatin family members oligomerize with each other  <cit>  and the coiled-coil domain has been shown to mediate this interaction  <cit> . other proteins found in complexes with striatin family members include, but are not limited to, mob3/phocein   <cit> , which is involved in vesicular trafficking  <cit> ; mst <dig>  mst <dig>  and stk <dig>  <cit> , members of the germinal center kinase-iii  subfamily of sterile 20-like kinases recently implicated in control of cell migration, cell cycle, golgi assembly, and cell polarity  <cit> ; cerebral cavernous malformation  <dig>  protein  <cit> , which is required for stabilization of the gck-iii kinases and thus for their function  <cit> ; and striatin-interacting proteins   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, striatin family complexes containing pp2a, mob <dig>  gck-iii kinases, ccm <dig>  and strip  <dig> and  <dig> can also associate mutually exclusively with additional components  <cit> . finally, striatin has been found to bind gαi and estrogen receptor α, facilitating rapid non-genomic signaling of estrogen receptor α  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest that a common function of striatin family complexes is their involvement in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking. striatin, sg2na and the common associated protein mob <dig> are localized to the golgi, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane  <cit>  and the golgi localizations of sg2na and mob <dig> are rapidly altered by exposure of cells to brefeldin a, an inhibitor of arfs, small g proteins known to regulate vesicular trafficking  <cit> . in addition, striatin, sg2na, and mob <dig> all associate with proteins implicated in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking  <cit> . finally, both ccm <dig> and the drosophila mob3/phocein homolog, dmob <dig>  have been directly implicated in endocytosis and/or vesicular trafficking  <cit> .

striatin complexes have been linked to several clinical conditions. the ccm <dig> protein found in striatin complexes is one of three gene products mutated in cerebral cavernous malformation, a common type of angioma  <cit> . moreover, a small deletion in the 3' untranslated region of striatin that leads to lower levels of striatin mrna was recently implicated in a canine model of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy  <cit> . finally, the striatin gene was also found in one of twenty-two loci containing common variants associated with qrs interval length and cardiac ventricular conduction  <cit> . thus, the study of striatin family complexes is of great interest because of their potential roles in vesicular trafficking, golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, cell cycle, signaling, and disease.

despite the identification of a large number of components of striatin family complexes, little is known about the architecture of these complexes and their regulation. defining the molecular organization of striatin family complexes is critical to understanding how they function. equally important is the elucidation of the targets, roles, and regulation of the phosphatase and kinase enzymes in these complexes. striatin association with the pp2a a/c heterodimer alters pp2a's substrate specificity  <cit> , but the targets and role of striatin-associated pp2a are not known. treatment of cells with okadaic acid at concentrations known to inhibit pp2a induces hyperphosphorylation of striatin, sg2na, mob <dig>  and other unidentified striatin family binding partners, including proteins that migrate at the size and isoelectric point of mst <dig> and mst <dig>  <cit> . thus, striatin-associated pp2a may regulate the function of striatin-family complexes by modulating the phosphorylation state of striatin and its associated proteins, including the mst <dig> and mst <dig> kinases. however, this hypothesis has not been directly tested.

to help define the molecular organization of striatin complexes and to determine whether mst <dig> might be regulated by striatin-associated pp2a, we performed a structure-function analysis of striatin, defining domains of striatin important for the binding of a number of striatin binding partners and determining the effect of pp2a-deficient striatin mutants on the activation state of mst <dig>  to gain insight into the mechanism of mst <dig> activation by autophosphorylation, we also performed a mutational analysis of mst <dig> activation loop phosphorylation sites. our results greatly enhance our understanding of the architecture of striatin family complexes, uncover unique binding requirements for pp2a, and provide new insight into the oligomerization of striatin family members and into the mechanism of activation of mst <dig> by autophosphorylation. overall, they support a model in which striatin orchestrates the regulation of mst <dig> by pp2a to regulate mst <dig> function in the cell.

RESULTS
generation of striatin mutants for structure-function analysis of striatin complexes
to facilitate dissection of the molecular organization of striatin complexes, we generated a set of deletion mutants and a complementary set of point mutants of striatin for use in our experiments. because all cells tested to date contain endogenous striatin, all striatin mutants were constructed with an n-terminal hemagglutinin -epitope tag to allow specific immunoprecipitation and detection of the exogenously expressed wild-type and mutant striatins. figure 1a shows the known domain organization of striatin while figure 1b shows a schematic of the different striatin mutants used in this study on the same scale as figure 1a.

the wd-repeats of striatin are not required for pp2a binding but contribute to mob <dig> association
the a and c subunits of pp2a are known to bind striatin  <cit>  but the region of striatin that binds to pp2a is unknown. as a first approach to identifying striatin sequences important for pp2a association, we compared the relative ability of ha-epitope tagged wild-type striatin and two ha-tagged striatin c-terminal deletion mutants, k270stop and f457stop , to bind pp2a in vivo. both bind pp2a . quantitation of the ratio of pp2a bound to striatin shows that loss of seven of eight of striatin's wd-repeats  has no effect on pp2a association while loss of all eight wd-repeats plus the central region of striatin  has only a small effect on pp2a binding that was not statistically significant . these data indicate that residues 270- <dig> of human striatin are largely dispensable for pp2a association and that the first  <dig> amino acids of striatin contain the primary pp2a binding domain.

to determine the importance of c-terminal striatin sequences for mob3/striatin complex formation, the same immunoprecipitates were probed for mob <dig>  mob <dig>  like pp2a, also binds to both of the c-terminal deletion mutants . thus, amino acids 1- <dig> in striatin also contain a domain that binds mob <dig>  either directly or indirectly. however, quantitation of results from multiple experiments shows that mob <dig> binds at reduced levels to both of the c-terminal mutants . loss of seven wd-repeats  or all eight wd-repeats plus the central region of striatin  results in a 29% or 45% reduction in mob <dig> binding, respectively. these results demonstrate that the wd-repeats are important for efficient association of mob <dig> and that residues between  <dig> and  <dig> may also contribute. thus, striatin residues 1- <dig> contain binding sites for both mob <dig> and pp2a.

both n- and c-terminal sequences of striatin associate with mob <dig> but only n-terminal striatin sequences associate stably with pp2a
the reduced binding of mob <dig> to both of the striatin c-terminal deletion mutants suggested that striatin sequences beyond residue  <dig> might bind mob <dig>  to test for this possibility, immunoprecipitates of Δ striatin, an n-terminal deletion mutant of striatin , were probed for the presence of mob <dig>  the Δ striatin mutant bound mob <dig> at approximately 40% the level of wild-type striatin . thus, there are at least two distinct domains within striatin  capable of interacting directly or indirectly with mob <dig>  pp2a c subunit, on the other hand, did not bind to Δ striatin , demonstrating that pp2a associates stably only with residues located in the n-terminal region of striatin.

the coiled-coil and caveolin-binding domains of striatin, but not the calmodulin-binding domain of striatin, are necessary for oligomerization and for pp2a binding
to further localize the pp2a-binding domain within the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of striatin, ha-tagged striatin mutants lacking previously identified n-terminal protein-interaction domains  were created . co-immunoprecipitation was utilized to test the abilities of these mutants to bind pp2a c subunit . the coiled-coil domain of striatin is required for binding pp2a, since a coiled-coil deletion mutant, Δ, is unable to specifically co-precipitate pp2a c subunit . it has been reported that the coiled-coil domain is the oligomerization domain of the striatin family of proteins  <cit> . in agreement with this, Δ striatin fails to oligomerize with sg2na and zinedin, as demonstrated by the absence of sg2na and zinedin in immunoprecipitates of this mutant . Δ also shows reduced ability to bind mob <dig>  binding only 40% of wild-type levels. considering the fact that there is a mob <dig> binding domain in aa1- <dig> of striatin that can bind approximately 55% of the wild-type level of mob <dig> , these results suggest that the coiled-coil domain contains binding sites for both pp2a and mob <dig> 

in addition to the coiled-coil domain, striatin has been reported to bind caveolin- <dig> through a caveolin-binding domain found within amino acid residues 53- <dig>  <cit> . to determine the role, if any, of the caveolin-binding domain in striatin association with pp2a and mob <dig>  a mutant of striatin lacking the caveolin-binding domain, Δ striatin, was analyzed. co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Δ striatin binds little to no pp2a . in contrast, the Δ striatin mutant could co-precipitate mob <dig> at near wild-type levels, confirming that loss of pp2a binding is specific and not due to protein misfolding. interestingly, this mutant is completely defective in oligomerization as indicated by its inability to bind sg2na and zinedin , indicating that one or more residues within 53- <dig> are essential for striatin oligomerization.

finally, we examined the importance of the calmodulin-binding domain in the n-terminus of striatin by analyzing the striatin deletion mutant, Δ, which deletes this entire domain . loss of striatin's calmodulin-binding domain has only a small effect on pp2a c subunit binding, and no significant effect on mob <dig> binding or oligomerization with sg2na and zinedin .

residues in the coiled-coil domain of striatin are critical for pp2a c subunit association independent from their role in oligomerization
the fact that the coiled-coil domain of striatin is required for its association with pp2a suggested that pp2a might bind directly to this region. if so, the introduction of point mutants in the coiled-coil domain may disrupt pp2a binding without interfering with striatin oligomerization. to test this hypothesis, we compared the peptide sequence of the coiled-coil domain of striatin from several species and identified residues that were completely conserved. four such residues were arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig>  pairs of these residues were substituted with uncharged serine residues or residues of opposite charge in an attempt to disrupt striatin/pp2a association. the resulting double point mutants, r88s/k89e and r100s/r101e striatin, were then analyzed for pp2a, mob <dig>  and sg2na binding. the mutants r88s/k89e and r100s/r101e are able to bind only 40% and 10% of wild-type levels of pp2a c subunit, respectively . binding of mob <dig> was not reduced. both mutants retained the ability to efficiently bind sg2na at wild-type  or near wild-type  levels , indicating that effects on pp2a c subunit can be separated from effects on oligomerization. these results support the hypothesis that pp2a binds directly to the coiled-coil domain of striatin.

to further investigate pp2a binding in the coiled-coil domain, four conserved hydrophobic residues  were replaced with alanine. two triple mutants  reduced pp2a binding to 32% to 17% of wild-type levels, while striatin oligomerization remained intact . no statistically significant reduction in the binding of mob <dig> was seen. together, these results show that critical residues in the pp2a binding domain of striatin are within the central portion of the coiled-coil domain between residues  <dig> and  <dig> 

to define whether the coiled-coil domain was sufficient to bind pp2a and to test the importance of the amino acids preceding the caveolin-binding domain for pp2a binding, two additional mutants  were constructed . both of these mutants contain the coiled-coil domain. because the caveolin-binding domain is also required for pp2a binding  both mutants were designed to retain this domain as well, but mutant 46- <dig> lacks most of the amino acids that precede it. pp2a binds efficiently to both mutants, demonstrating that the binding site for pp2a is within striatin amino acids 46- <dig> and that the first forty-five amino acids of striatin are dispensable for pp2a binding .

determinants within striatin residues 191- <dig> are critical for binding to mst <dig> and mst <dig> kinases and to ccm3
we next investigated the association of striatin with mst <dig> kinase, a recently discovered component of striatin family complexes  <cit> . initial experiments showed that mst <dig> does not bind to Δ striatin , indicating that striatin residues before  <dig> are critical for its association. however, mst <dig> bound well to Δ striatin  and Δ , indicating that mst <dig> association with striatin does not require the coiled-coil or caveolin-binding domains or oligomerization of striatin. this result also indicates that the loss of pp2a binding to Δ seen in figure 3a-b is not simply due to misfolding of this mutant.

to further delineate the striatin residues needed for mst <dig> binding, the ability of mst <dig> to associate with a set of deletion mutants spanning regions of unknown function between the coiled-coil domain and residue  <dig> of striatin  was measured. the results of this analysis  indicate that deletion of the residues between the coiled-coil domain and the calmodulin domain and deletions after the calmodulin-binding domain up to residue  <dig> cause no reduction in mst <dig> binding. however, deletion of residues 191- <dig> causes a ~33% reduction in mst <dig> binding while loss of residues 270- <dig> causes an ~85% loss of mst <dig> binding. deletion of striatin amino acids 191- <dig> and 270- <dig> also reduced mst <dig> binding by  <dig> ± 5% and  <dig> ± 3%, respectively . these results indicate that the mst <dig> and mst <dig> binding sites probably span across amino acid  <dig>  with the strongest interactions being c-terminal to this residue.

because ccm <dig> has been reported to bind and stabilize mst <dig> and mst <dig>  <cit> , the importance of striatin residues 191- <dig> and 270- <dig> for ccm <dig> binding was tested. since commercially available ccm <dig> antibodies did not consistently detect ccm <dig>  we established a stable flag-tagged ccm3-expressing cell line as described in methods and analyzed the ability of this ccm <dig> to associate with ha-tagged wild-type and mutant striatins by co-immunoprecipitation. deletion of striatin residues 191- <dig> and 270- <dig> reduced ccm <dig> binding ~40% and ~90%, respectively , suggesting that ccm <dig> and the mst <dig> and mst <dig> kinases may bind as a complex to this region of striatin.

the calmodulin-binding domain of striatin negatively regulates association with the mst <dig> and mst <dig> kinases
the deletion mutant, Δ striatin, had a statistically significant ~25% increase in the amount of mst <dig> bound . since this region is just before the calmodulin-binding domain of striatin, we tested the ability of mst <dig> to bind to Δ striatin, in which the calmodulin-binding domain has been deleted. at the same time, we tested an additional mutant, Δ striatin, spanning the region that seemed to affect mst <dig> binding the most. the results indicate that Δ striatin is almost completely defective in mst <dig> binding, while still binding mob <dig> at 75% of wild-type levels . in striking contrast, mst <dig> bound ~ <dig> -fold better when the calmodulin-binding domain of striatin was deleted . interestingly, probing of the same immunoprecipitates for the related striatin-associated kinase, mst <dig>  revealed a less dramatic reduction  in mst <dig> binding to Δ striatin but a similar ~4-fold increase in binding to the calmodulin-binding domain deletion mutant.

striatin-associated pp2a negatively regulates the phosphorylation of mst <dig> kinase
previously, two-dimensional analysis of sg2na complexes from 32p-inorganic phosphate-labeled cells revealed an ~ <dig> kda unknown protein whose phosphorylation increased dramatically upon treatment of cells with okadaic acid at concentrations known to inhibit pp2a  <cit> . the size and estimated isoelectric point of that phosphoprotein are similar to mst <dig>  raising the possibility that striatin-associated pp2a regulates the phosphorylation state of striatin-associated mst <dig>  to test this possibility, we took advantage of the fact that phosphorylation slows the mobility of many proteins. figure 8a shows that upon incubation with atp and manganese in vitro, a portion of mst <dig> undergoes a gel shift on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the gel shift does not occur in the absence of atp or if the kinase inhibitor staurosporine is included , indicating that the shift occurs due to autophosphorylation of mst <dig> or phosphorylation of mst <dig> by a tightly associated kinase.

mst <dig> in lysates from untreated human  <dig> cells exists predominantly as one major band and a minor, more slowly migrating, upper band . upon treatment with  <dig> nm okadaic acid, the mst <dig> in the lower band shifts to the upper band over time until at  <dig> h the upper band becomes the predominant band . it was previously shown that treatment of mammalian cells with  <dig> nm okadaic acid for  <dig> h- <dig> h inhibits most cellular pp2a without significantly inhibiting pp <dig> because of the slow rate at which okadaic acid enters cells  <cit> . considered together, these results indicate that mst <dig> phosphorylation may be regulated by pp2a.

okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of mst <dig> could be due to inhibition of pp2a in the striatin complex or to inhibition of another pp2a holoenzyme responsible for regulating the phosphorylation state of mst <dig>  to distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested whether selectively reducing the amount of pp2a associated with striatin would increase the steady-state phosphorylation level of mst <dig> in those striatin complexes. we reasoned that if pp2a in the striatin complex were responsible for dephosphorylation of striatin-associated mst <dig>  then mutant striatins with reduced pp2a binding would bind phosphorylated mst <dig> but dephosphorylate it at a reduced rate, causing the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated mst <dig> in those striatin complexes.

to test this prediction, the four pp2a-deficient striatin coiled-coil domain point mutants were used. in cells expressing these mutants, pp2a that is not complexed with striatin  will be unaffected; only the amount of pp2a associated with ha-striatin will be affected. we compared the ratio of the upper  and lower bands of mst <dig> associated with the pp2a-deficient striatin mutants with the ratio of these mst <dig> bands associated with wild-type striatin. figure 8c  shows the results of a representative experiment. mst <dig> associated with striatin mutants deficient in binding pp2a has a greater proportion of the upper band than mst <dig> associated with wild-type striatin, indicating that there is an increased amount of hyperphosphorylated mst <dig> associated with the pp2a-deficient striatin mutants. quantitative analysis of several experiments showed that mst <dig> hyperphosphorylation was significantly increased in all four of our pp2a-deficient striatin complexes , with the greatest increase in the r100s/r101e mutant shown in figure  <dig> to be the most defective in binding pp2a. the reduction of pp2a binding to striatin causes the hyperphosphorylation  of a large fraction of the associated mst <dig>  as can be seen most clearly by visual comparison of the mst <dig> bands in the wild-type and r100s/r101e lanes in the ha-ip panel of figure 8c. more than half of mst <dig> associated with the r100s/r101e mutant is in the upper band.

to determine the effect on the total mst <dig> population in the cell, we also analyzed the amount of hyperphosphorylation  of mst <dig> in lysates from cells expressing exogenous wild-type or pp2a-deficient mutant striatins. figure 8c-d  show that expression of pp2a-deficient striatin does cause an increase in total hyperphosphorylated mst <dig> in cells. the most robust increase, ~ <dig> -fold, was again induced by expression of the striatin mutant most deficient in binding pp2a, r100s/r101e.

to definitively prove that the gel shift in mst <dig> observed with pp2a-deficient striatin mutants is due to increased phosphorylation and not some other modification, we tested whether gel-shifted mst <dig> associated with r100s/r101e striatin could be eliminated by treatment with purified pp2a. the slower migrating form of mst <dig> disappeared when denatured r100s/r101e striatin immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified pp2a but not when they were incubated with pp2a and okadaic acid . together, these results indicate that pp2a in the striatin complex regulates the phosphorylation state of striatin-bound mst <dig> 

pp2a negatively regulates the activation of striatin-associated mst <dig> kinase
to gain insight into the functional significance of the pp2a-regulated phosphorylation of mst <dig> in the striatin complex, we determined the sites of phosphorylation on mst <dig> necessary for the observed gel shift. to do this, the three reported activation loop phosphorylation sites of mst <dig>  threonine residues  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in mst <dig> isoform b , were individually mutated to alanine to prevent their phosphorylation. after transfection of constructs expressing flag-tagged wild-type and mutant mst <dig> isoform b proteins into hek <dig> cells and treatment of the cells with okadaic acid or vehicle control , lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-flag antibody . the results show that mutation of threonine  <dig> causes a small reduction in the ratio of shifted to unshifted mst <dig> bands while mutation of either threonine  <dig> or  <dig> to alanine abolishes the okadaic-acid induced gel shift of mst <dig> 

next an autophosphorylation site-specific  antibody was used to further analyze the t172a, t178a, and t182a mst <dig> mutants. because mst <dig>  mst <dig>  and stk <dig> have similar sequences in their activation loops, this antibody reacts with all of these kinases when activated by autophosphorylation. to specifically examine mst <dig>  lysates of okadaic acid-treated cells expressing the flag-tagged mst <dig> isoform b proteins were first denatured to disrupt complexes by heating with sds and reducing agent as described in methods. then anti-flag immunoprecipitates of wild-type and mutant mst <dig> proteins were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-mst <dig>  antibody and with anti-flag antibody . the results confirm the specificity of the anti-phospho-mst <dig>  antibody since only igg background is seen in the t178a pmst <dig> immunoblot lane while a strong band of the t178a mutant protein is seen in the flag-mst <dig>  immunoblot panel. the results also reveal that the t182a mst <dig> mutant is phosphorylated robustly on threonine  <dig> and that mst <dig> phosphorylated on threonine  <dig> is present in both the lower and upper bands of the mst <dig> doublet in the wild-type and t172a lanes. thus, phosphorylation of threonine  <dig> is not sufficient to generate the upper mst <dig> band, but appears to be a prerequisite for its formation. no threonine  <dig> phosphorylation was detected on any of the flag-tagged mst <dig> proteins when flag-mst <dig> immunoprecipitates were prepared from vehicle control -treated cells , indicating that the mst <dig> autophosphorylation on threonine  <dig> seen with okadaic acid-treated cells was induced by okadaic acid and not pre-existing. together, the results in this section show that both the upper and lower mst <dig> bands contain phosphorylated mst <dig> species but generation of the upper, hyperphosphorylated band appears to require at a minimum phosphorylation of both threonine  <dig> and threonine  <dig> in the activation loop of mst <dig>  thus, the gel shift seen with pp2a-deficient striatin mutants is indicative of, but probably an underestimate of, activation and autophosphorylation of mst <dig> 

discussion
the results of this study help define the architecture and regulation of the striatin family complexes. a model for the organization of the striatin complex is presented in figure  <dig>  the creation of striatin point mutants deficient in pp2a association facilitated a set of experiments clearly identifying striatin-associated pp2a as the phosphatase negatively regulating mst <dig> activation in striatin family complexes. moreover, mutational analysis of mst <dig> autophosphorylation sites and studies with the pp2a inhibitor, okadaic acid, provided new insight on mst <dig> activation.

the a and c subunits of pp2a were previously shown to bind to striatin family complexes but the region of striatin to which the a/c heterodimer bound was unknown  <cit> . our current data show that the coiled-coil domain of striatin mediates the formation of this pp2a heterotrimer . although we cannot rule out a direct contribution of the caveolin-binding motif, the fact that double or triple point mutations in the middle of the coiled-coil/oligomerization domain of striatin almost completely disrupt pp2a association suggests that the primary determinants for pp2a binding are near the middle of the coiled-coil domain .

our data also suggest that pp2a association with striatin is dependent on oligomerization of striatin complexes. of the charged coiled-coil residues that were mutated to disrupt pp2a binding to striatin, only arginine  <dig> is predicted to be at the dimerization interface when either ncoils  <cit>  or paircoil <dig>  <cit>  prediction programs are used, while the other residues are predicted to be more available to potentially interact with pp2a. however, arginine  <dig>  mutated in the r100s/r101e mutant, is part of a signature in striatin called a trimerization motif  <cit> , and could have an effect on topology as well. of the hydrophobic coiled-coil mutations, leucine  <dig>  isoleucine  <dig>  and leucine  <dig> are predicted to be at the dimerization interface, while leucine  <dig> may be more accessible. thus, it is interesting that the striatin mutant l84a/l94a/l105a is significantly more defective in pp2a binding than the mutant l84a/l94a/i102a , because the only difference between these two mutants is in amino acids predicted to be at the interface of the helices. these results are consistent with the idea that association of the pp2a a/c heterodimer is sensitive to local alterations in the dimerization interface of striatin. we hypothesize that this sensitivity results from pp2a binding asymmetrically across the dimerization interface to more than one striatin family coiled-coil domain. further support for this model comes from the fact that deletion of the caveolin-binding motif, which leaves the residues mutated above intact, abolishes oligomerization of striatin and its association with pp2a. thus, although a precise understanding of the effects of the different striatin mutants on pp2a association may await crystallization studies, our current data are consistent with a model in which the pp2a a/c heterodimer binds to the coiled-coil domain of striatin family members in an oligomerization-dependent manner. because we have shown that mst <dig> binding to striatin is not dependent on striatin family oligomerization, this model provides an attractive feature of restricting the regulation of striatin-associated mst <dig> by pp2a until oligomerization occurs.

a surprising result from this study was the complete loss of oligomerization caused by deletion of the caveolin-binding motif within striatin ). a previous study  <cit>  reported that a fusion protein consisting of residues 81- <dig> of mouse sg2na  fused to the c-terminus of gfp did not oligomerize for unknown reasons. one possible explanation for both of these results is that striatin family oligomerization requires binding of caveolin. this would have to be a transient requirement, however, because we could find no associated caveolin even in wild-type striatin immunoprecipitates  and no caveolin was found in striatin family complexes in a recent proteomics study  <cit> . alternatively, loss of oligomerization could result from one or more of the deleted residues being directly required for oligomerization. analyses using ncoils  <cit>  and paircoil <dig>  <cit>  prediction programs suggest that the n- and c-terminal limits previously assigned to the coiled-coil domain of striatin  may need to be extended. using a  <dig> residue window with ncoils, which is recommended for locating the ends of coil-coils, and an unweighted analysis , probabilities of almost  <dig> are obtained for residues 61- <dig> being part of the coiled-coil of human striatin. weighted analysis  using the same window still assigns these residues high probability  of being part of the coiled-coil. results from similar analyses of human sg2na suggest that sg2na residues corresponding to striatin aa61- <dig>  or aa64- <dig>  have a high probability of being part of the coiled-coil. finally, for human zinedin, ncoils predicts unweighted and weighted n-terminal ends corresponding to striatin aa <dig> and aa <dig>  respectively. for striatin, sg2na, and zinedin, these analyses also suggest that the c-terminal end of the coiled-coil may be around aa120- <dig>  paircoil <dig> analysis of these proteins predicts a similar end to the coiled-coil but an even earlier start to it, ranging from striatin aa56- <dig>  potentially including much of the caveolin-binding motif, residues 53- <dig>  the results of these analyses are consistent with the idea that our caveolin deletion mutant and the gfp-sg2na fusion protein published by others may have removed amino acids critical to the formation of striatin coiled-coils. since the missing residues common to both of these constructs are residues 53- <dig>  it is possible that these are the critical amino acids. in fact, the complete loss of coiled-coil formation caused by our small caveolin-binding motif deletion is reminiscent of "trigger" sequences, sequences absolutely required for coiled-coil formation  <cit> . additional analyses will be needed to firmly define the striatin coiled-coil and resolve these possibilities.

there are at least two distinct domains within striatin  that interact directly or indirectly with mob . the c-terminal striatin residues important for mob <dig> binding were further narrowed down by the fact that deletion of striatin residues 270- <dig> had no significant effect on mob <dig> binding . this result suggested that the most important c-terminal determinants of striatin for mob binding likely occur after residue  <dig> and include the wd domain. however, because of the larger standard deviation of mob <dig> binding to the Δ mutant, a contribution of striatin residues 310- <dig> cannot be completely ruled out. in the n-terminus of striatin, mob <dig> binding seems to be largely restricted to the coiled-coil domain because deletion mutants collectively spanning residues 115- <dig> and a mutant deleting the caveolin-binding motif had no significant effect on mob <dig> binding, while deletion of the coiled-coil domain had the same reduction of mob <dig> binding as the Δ striatin mutant. the fact that mob <dig> binds much better to the caveolin-binding motif deletion mutant than to the coiled-coil deletion mutant and close to wild-type levels also supports the idea that mob <dig> binding to the striatin n-terminus is not highly dependent on oligomerization. this result suggests that mob <dig> binding to the striatin n-terminus is not solely due to indirect binding of mob <dig> through oligomerization of endogenous striatin family members with mutants. however, additional studies are necessary to strengthen this conclusion. it has not been firmly established whether mob <dig> binds directly or indirectly to striatin. a previous study identified mob <dig>  by its binding to striatin in a two-hybrid assay but no additional data was presented to rule out the possibility that the interaction was mediated by a conserved protein in yeast  bridging the association. mob <dig> binds striatin independently of pp2a c subunit, mst <dig>  and ccm <dig> because when close to 85% of the latter associations were disrupted by various mutations little to no reduction in mob <dig> binding was seen. since pp2a c subunit, mst <dig>  and ccm <dig> are other core striatin binding partners, the results support the model that mob <dig> binds directly to striatin. however, the question of whether striatin binds two molecules of mob <dig> or uses two binding domains to interact with a single molecule of mob <dig> still needs to be resolved. given our other data on the organization of the striatin complex, it is tempting to speculate that binding of two striatin domains to one mob <dig> molecule might function in part to bring mst <dig> and pp2a into proximity in the 3d structure of striatin.

the results of this study show that striatin-associated pp2a is the phosphatase responsible for negatively regulating the phosphorylation and activation of mst <dig> in striatin family complexes. four separate striatin point mutants deficient in pp2a binding showed hyperphosphorylation of associated mst <dig>  moreover, hyperphosphorylated, gel-shifted mst <dig> could also be detected in lysates from cells expressing these mutants, indicating that these mutants cause the hyperphosphorylation of a significant portion of the mst <dig> in the cell. using mst <dig> activation loop point mutants, autophosphorylation site t178-specific antibody, and okadaic acid to inhibit pp2a and activate mst <dig> in vivo  <cit> , we demonstrated that gel-shifted mst <dig> was indicative of mst <dig> activation and autophosphorylation in vivo. this conclusion is further supported by previous studies that reported a gel shift of mst <dig> upon autophosphorylation in vitro  <cit> , and a consequential increase in kinase activity after autophosphorylation  <cit> . our data further show that the mst <dig> gel shift represents an underestimation of the amount of mst <dig> autophosphorylated on threonine  <dig>  the reported site of mst <dig> autophosphorylation for mst3b  <cit> , because phosphorylation at both threonines  <dig> and  <dig> on mst3b appears to be required to obtain the observed gel shift. thus, striatin-associated pp2a negatively regulates the phosphorylation and activation of mst <dig>  and likely of the other related kinases in striatin family complexes, mst <dig>  and stk <dig>  as well. the fact that reduction in striatin-associated pp2a is sufficient to cause activation of mst <dig> suggests that one way the mst <dig> and the other gckiii kinases could be regulated is by modulation of striatin-associated pp2a activity or modulation of pp2a's access to mst <dig> in striatin family complexes. an important goal of future research on these complexes will be to determine if these mechanisms exist, and if so, to elucidate them.

previous data suggested that threonine  <dig> was not a major autophosphorylation site on mst <dig>  <cit> . however, this data was largely based on peptide phosphorylation studies. we  and others  <cit>  have found that incubation of immunoprecipitated mst <dig> in the presence of atp and manganese generates the hypershifted form of mst <dig> in vitro. considered together with the current result that mutation of threonine  <dig> to alanine completely prevents the gel-shift of mst <dig> without blocking the phosphorylation of threonine  <dig>  this finding supports the notion that threonine  <dig> is a major autophosphorylation site of mst <dig>  the fact that there is no detectable gel shift when either threonine  <dig> or threonine  <dig> is mutated to alanine is intriguing. one possible explanation is that simultaneous phosphorylation at both of these sites is required to produce the gel shift. another possibility is that there may be a preference for sequential phosphorylation of mst <dig> activation loop phosphorylation sites, with phosphorylation at threonine  <dig> being a prerequisite for phosphorylation at threonine  <dig>  which in turn is required for the observed gel shift to occur. evidence for an interdependence in activation loop phosphorylations has been noted previously for other kinases such as chk <dig>  <cit> . availability of a phospho-specific antibody for threonine  <dig> of mst <dig> would be helpful for distinguishing between these and other possibilities.

deletion of the calmodulin-binding domain  striatin), which has no effect on striatin oligomerization or binding of mob <dig> to striatin and little effect on pp2a association with striatin , caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in both mst <dig> and mst <dig> association with striatin. this result is consistent with the possibility that the calmodulin-binding domain negatively regulates the binding of mst <dig> and mst <dig> in striatin family complexes. the effect of this deletion mutant is not simply due to the removal of amino acids in this general area of the striatin sequence because adjacent deletions on either side of the calmodulin-binding domain had either no effect or only a modest 25% increase in mst <dig> binding. given that we and others have shown that striatin family members associate with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner  <cit> , calcium may regulate mst <dig> and mst <dig> recruitment to striatin complexes by regulating calmodulin binding to striatin. however, it is also possible that removal of these specific sequences modifies mst <dig> binding in a manner that will not be recapitulated by changes in calcium. further experimentation will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study help define the architecture of striatin complexes by identifying residues of striatin important for complex formation with mob <dig>  pp2a, mst <dig>  mst <dig>  and ccm <dig>  our data support the novel hypothesis that pp2a binding to the coiled-coil domain requires striatin family oligomerization, which has implications for the assembly of striatin family complexes and the ability of pp2a to regulate other components of these complexes. the finding of residues critical for striatin oligomerization n-terminal to its previously assigned coiled-coil domain combined with results from analyses using coiled-coil prediction programs suggest that striatin's coiled-coil domain may begin earlier in the striatin sequence than previously thought. in addition, our results support a model in which striatin binds mst <dig> and ccm <dig> likely as a dimer via residues lying between striatin's calmodulin-binding and wd-domains and recruits the pp2a a/c heterodimer to its coiled-coil/oligomerization domain to regulate mst <dig>  striatin-associated pp2a is critical for efficient dephosphorylation and inactivation of striatin-associated mst <dig>  upon inhibition of pp2a by okadaic acid, mst <dig> activation appears to involve autophosphorylation of its activation loop phosphorylation sites, resulting in a gel shift on sds-page. mob <dig> can associate with striatin sequences c-terminal to the mst <dig> binding site but also with sequences proximal to striatin-associated pp2a, consistent with a possible role for mob  <dig> in the regulation of mst <dig> by pp2a.
