BACKGROUND
myostatin  and growth/differentiation factor  <dig>  are highly related members of the transforming growth factor β  superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors. like other tgfβ family members, myostatin and gdf <dig> precursor proteins are proteolytically processed to form biologically-active carboxy-terminal dimers. myostatin and gdf <dig> share 90% amino acid identity in this carboxy-terminal region which places them in their own tgfβ family subgroup. they also have similar signaling pathways; both bind the activin type iib receptor  and activate the intracellular mediator smad 2/ <dig> pathway  <cit> , and both are antagonized by follistatin, a secreted glycoprotein that can bind several tgfβ family members  <cit> .

mstn is predominantly expressed in developing and adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . we previously reported the disruption of the mstn gene by gene targeting in mice and showed that myostatin normally functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass  <cit> . most mstn-/- muscles are approximately double the mass of mstn+/+ muscles due to both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of myofibers  <cit> . subsequently, naturally occurring mstn gene mutations were found in cattle, dogs, sheep, and one child with increased muscle mass indicating conservation of myostatin function in mammals  <cit> . injection of myostatin antagonists also causes a significant increase in muscle mass in normal and dystrophic adult mice demonstrating that myostatin function is not restricted to developmental stages  <cit> . these results suggest that inhibition of myostatin may be a promising therapeutic target for treating muscle wasting diseases.

we also reported the deletion of the gdf <dig> gene by gene targeting in mice  <cit> . in contrast to mstn-/- mice, gdf11-/- mice display anterior homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton wherein the identity of posterior vertebrae are transformed into those of more anterior vertebrae  <cit> . anterior/posterior  axial mesoderm identity is thought to be established by differential combinatorial expression of hox genes that are induced as cells move through the primitive streak during gastrulation  <cit> . consistent with this model, gdf <dig> is strongly expressed in the primitive streak and tail bud  <cit> , and gdf11-/- mice have altered hox gene expression along the a/p axis  <cit> . in addition to the axial skeleton, defects in gdf11-/- mice are found in other tissues where gdf <dig> is expressed. for instance, gdf11-/- mice have renal agenesis, an increase in the number of islet progenitors in the pancreas, an increase in the number of neurons and neuronal progenitors in the olfactory epithelium, and an increase in the number of retinal ganglion cells and reduction in the number of photoreceptors and amacrine cells in the retina  <cit> .

although the phenotypes caused by each gene disruption appear to be non-overlapping, the high sequence identity and similarity in signaling mechanisms suggest the two factors may be functionally redundant. in addition, mstn is expressed transiently in the primitive streak in the chick  <cit> . we therefore decided to test whether myostatin has a role in determining a/p positional identity of the axial skeleton. in a similar vein, gdf <dig> has been shown to inhibit myogenesis in chick limb mensenchyme cultures  <cit> , so we also sought to test whether gdf <dig> has a role in regulating skeletal muscle mass. our data show that myostatin and gdf <dig> have redundant functions in regulating skeletal patterning in mice but most likely not in regulating muscle size.

RESULTS
skeletal patterning in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice
we crossed double heterozygous mice  to produce mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice to examine redundancy of myostatin and gdf <dig> function during development. mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice were born at the expected ratio , but none were found alive. while most gdf11-/- mutants have renal agenesis and cleft palate  <cit> , these phenotypes were fully penetrant in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice. to analyze skeletal alterations in double mutants, we performed skeleton preps on newborn mice to determine vertebral identity. wild-type mice commonly have  <dig> thoracic and  <dig> lumbar vertebrae while gdf11-/- mice typically have  <dig> thoracic and  <dig> lumbar vertebrae  <cit> . gdf11-/- offspring from crosses of double heterozygotes had 17– <dig> thoracic and 7– <dig> lumbar vertebrae as expected . in contrast, skeletons of mstn-/- mice had a similar pattern as the majority of wild-type mice with  <dig> thoracic and  <dig> lumbar vertebrae . deletion of one allele of mstn in gdf11-/- mice  also had no effect on thoracic or lumbar vertebral number in comparison with gdf11-/- mice . loss of both alleles of mstn in gdf11-/- mice, however, resulted in a much more severe phenotype. most mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice had  <dig> rather than  <dig> thoracic vertebrae although in  <dig> out of  <dig> double mutant pups the transformations were even more dramatic . in these  <dig> mice, the most posterior thoracic vertebra was asymmetric with a 21st rib on one side and a lumbar-like phenotype on the other . the extent of the anterior homeotic transformations in the thoracic region of mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice were greater than any we have seen in gdf11-/- mice.

numbers of mice displaying a given number of vertebrae are shown. some mice have left-right asymmetry of the most posterior thoracic vertebra with a rib on one side and a lumbar phenotype on the other. these are designated by a + sign between  <dig> numbers indicating the number of ribs for each side.

numbers of mice displaying a given number of vertebrae are shown. some mice have left-right asymmetry of the most posterior lumbar vertebra with a lumbar phenotype on one side and a sacral phenotype the other. these are designated by a + sign between  <dig> numbers indicating the number of vertebrae possessing a lumbar appearance for each side. asymmetric vertebrae with a thoracic and lumbar phenotype were counted as thoracic . number of lumbar vertebrae could not be determined for mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice.

the skeletal regions posterior to the thoracic region were also altered in mutant mice. as previously described  <cit> , the sacral vertebrae were present in gdf11-/- mice, but the axis was truncated in the caudal region resulting in an overall decrease in the number of vertebral segments and the loss of most of the tail with only a few deformed vertebrae remaining . in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice, there were even fewer post-thoracic vertebrae with an average of  <dig> post-thoracic segments, the most posterior of which were malformed . the sacral vertebrae were not identifiable in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice making it difficult to tell which vertebra was the most posterior lumbar vertebra . the increase in severity of the gdf <dig> null phenotype throughout the vertebral axis in the absence of mstn demonstrates that myostatin and gdf <dig> play redundant roles in patterning and development of the axial skeleton.

mstn-/- gdf11-/- pups also had other skeletal defects not seen in gdf11-/- mutants. the frontal bones curved anteriorly to meet the nasal bone which gave the skull vault a rounded shape compared to gdf11-/- mice . although gdf <dig> is expressed in the developing limb buds  <cit> , no defects were detected in limbs of gdf11-/- mutants . mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice, however, had severe limb defects. many mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice had small projections emanating from the skin on the ventral surface of the torso, some of which were filled with a single rod of cartilage . in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mutants, the long bones of the forelimb were shortened relative to those in gdf11-/- mice and, in  <dig> out of  <dig> double mutants, an extra bone projected from shoulder . the most surprising result was a third limb that resembled a forelimb composed of a single unidentifiable long bone with attached digits . this phenotype was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> double mutants, two of which also had an extra bone on the contralateral shoulder. in all mstn-/- gdf11-/- mutants, the forelimbs in the normal position displayed digital patterning defects including a sixth digit, which appeared to be similar to digit v, and syndactyly of digits iii and iv consistent with the expression of gdf <dig> in the interdigital region where programmed cell death would normally occur  <cit>  . no other genotypes displayed any of these limb defects.

the hindlimbs in mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice displayed very different malformations than the forelimbs. the hindlimbs were small and deformed although what appeared to be elements of both proximal and distal structures, pelvic bones, long bones, and digits, were seen in most double mutants . these results suggest some proximal/distal patterning was maintained despite inhibition of hindlimb bud outgrowth.

this is the first demonstration that myostatin and gdf <dig> are both required for limb development and axial skeletal development and patterning. the effects of deletion of both factors on the axial skeleton was greater than for loss of gdf <dig> alone most likely due to the transient expression of mstn in the posterior primitive streak overlapping with gdf <dig> expression  <cit> . we presume that the extra limbs seen in the double mutant mice result from an expansion of the limb field, but clearly additional studies will be required to fully understand the molecular basis for the formation of the extra limb buds.

skeletal muscle in gdf <dig> mutants
we also sought to determine whether myostatin and gdf <dig> are functionally redundant with respect to control of muscle mass. the increase in muscle mass in mstn-/- mice is not present at birth  so the neonatal death of gdf11-/- and mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice precludes a comparison of the skeletal muscle phenotype. we therefore generated a targeting construct containing a conditional deletion allele of the gdf <dig> gene by inserting loxp recombination sites into intron  <dig> and flanking a neo gene downstream of the gdf <dig> 3' utr  . following homologous recombination in embryonic stem  cells and injection of the targeted cells into blastocysts, we obtained chimeric mice that transmitted the gdf11flox-neo allele through the germline. mice carrying the gdf11flox-neo allele were then crossed to eiia-cre transgenic mice to generate gdf11flox/+ mice carrying one upstream and one downstream loxp site after removal of the neo gene. recombination at the remaining loxp sites would be predicted to delete exons  <dig> and  <dig> , which would remove the biologically-active carboxy-terminal domain. to demonstrate that recombination of loxp sites produced a null allele, we generated germline recombination of loxp sites in gdf11flox/+ mice . skeletal analysis performed on offspring from gdf11Δ2–3/+ matings showed that gdf11Δ2–3/+ and gdf11Δ2–3/Δ2– <dig> mice had  <dig> and  <dig> extra thoracic vertebrae, respectively . these thoracic vertebral numbers are identical to that of gdf11+/- and gdf11-/- mice  <cit>  confirming that recombination of loxp sites in the gdf11flox allele results in a null allele.

for skeletal muscle-specific recombination of loxp sequences, a cre deletor transgenic line was made using the myosin light chain 1/ <dig> promoter/enhancer  . as expected, cre expression in this line was restricted to skeletal muscle . mlc-cre mice were crossed to gdf11flox/+ mice and then backcrossed to gdf11flox/+ mice or crossed to gdf11+/- from the original knockout line. recombination of gdf11flox was detected specifically in skeletal muscle genomic dna . in gdf11flox/- muscle, cre-mediated recombination resulted in a near complete reduction in skeletal muscle gdf <dig> expression .

body weight and muscle mass were measured in all  <dig> possible genotypes produced from crosses of gdf11flox/+ mlc-cre and gdf11+/- mice. there were no differences in body weight or muscle mass between gdf11+/+, gdf11+/+ mlc-cre, gdf11+/-, gdf11+/- mlc-cre, gdf11flox/+, or gdf11flox/+ mlc-cre mice demonstrating that there was no heterozygous or transgene phenotype . we next performed an examination of the muscle phenotype of gdf11flox/- and gdf11flox/- mlc-cre mice. there was no statistically significant difference in body weight or muscle mass between gdf11flox/- and gdf11flox/- mlc-cre mice .

skeletal muscles vary in their composition of fiber types which differ in metabolic and contractile properties  <cit> . in mice, type i fibers are slow contracting and oxidative, type iib fibers are fast contracting and glycolytic, and type iia and iid/x fibers are intermediate in phenotype. mstn-/- mice have an overall increase in the number of muscle fibers and alterations in the proportions of the different fiber types compared to mstn+/+ mice resulting in a shift toward more glycolytic muscle  <cit> . to determine whether gdf <dig> regulates fiber number or type, we counted the number of each of the four fiber types in gdf11flox/- and gdf11flox/- mlc-cre mice from the widest part of each muscle. we chose a fast muscle, the extensor digitorum longus , and a slow muscle, the soleus, for analysis because they have been previously shown to have alterations in fiber number and type in mstn-/- mice  <cit> . unlike muscle in mstn-/- mice, there was no difference in the total number of fibers in either the edl or the soleus muscles between gdf11flox/- and gdf11flox/- mlc-cre mice . fiber type composition in gdf11flox/- and gdf11flox/- mlc-cre mice was not significantly different either .

because a role for myostatin in axial skeletal patterning was found only in the absence of gdf <dig>  we asked whether a phenotype caused by loss of gdf <dig> in muscle might be present in the absence of myostatin. mstn-/- gdf11flox/flox mice were crossed to mstn-/- gdf11flox/flox mlc-cre mice, and body weight and muscle mass were measured in offspring at  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months of age. there were no significant differences in body weight or muscle mass found between genotypes at either age . next, we determined fiber number and fiber composition. there were no significant differences in the total number of fibers or in the number of individual fiber types in edl or soleus between mstn-/- gdf11flox/flox and mstn-/- gdf11flox/flox mlc-cre mice .

our results provide evidence that that myostatin and gdf <dig> have redundant functions in regulating skeletal development and patterning but not skeletal muscle size. we certainly cannot rule out the possibility that sufficient gdf <dig> function is maintained by the small amount of gdf <dig> expression remaining in the mutant muscles or that gdf <dig> may have a function in developing skeletal muscle at early stages of development prior to activation of the mlc promoter. gdf <dig> is detectable in serum  <cit>  so we also cannot rule out the possibility that gdf <dig> produced by other tissues not affected by muscle-specific recombination contributes to muscle mass regulation.

nevertheless, the lack of an effect of these genetic manipulations of gdf <dig> signaling on muscle mass was somewhat unexpected because myostatin and gdf <dig> are highly homologous and because the function of myostatin in regulating skeletal muscle mass is clearly redundant with that of other tgfβ family members. injection of a soluble acvr2b receptor causes a 20% increase in muscle mass in mstn-/- mice demonstrating that at least one other ligand in addition to myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle size  <cit> . this other acvr2b-binding ligand must also be inhibited by follistatin; mstn-/- mice have double the muscle mass of mstn+/+ mice while mstn-/- mice overexpressing a muscle-specific follistatin transgene have quadruple the skeletal muscle mass of mstn+/+ mice  <cit> . several other tgfβ superfamily members are potential candidates for myostatin functional redundancy. in addition to gdf <dig>  other family members, such as the activins and some bone morphogenetic proteins, bind acvr2b and follistatin  <cit> . myostatin, gdf <dig>  activin, and some bmps can be isolated from serum using acvr2b affinity purification  <cit> . the affinity of the bmps for follistatin, however, is considerably lower than that of activin, myostatin, and gdf <dig>  <cit> . additionally, the activins inhibit differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts and skeletal muscle precursors in the chick limb and would therefore be likely candidates for functional redundancy with myostatin  <cit> . it is also possible there are multiple tgfβ family members that are negative regulators of muscle mass in addition to myostatin that individually have only small effects on muscle growth. if so, deletion or inhibition of these factors might cause a measurable increase in muscle mass only in the absence of myostatin and other redundant ligands.

not only are the ligands redundant, myostatin and gdf <dig> receptor function is also redundant. although the affinity of myostatin for activin type ii receptor  is low  <cit> , acvr2-/- mice, like acvr2b-/- mice, have a small increase in skeletal muscle mass relative to mstn-/- mice  <cit> . this suggests that both acvr <dig> and acvr2b are receptors for myostatin in vivo. similarly, acvr2b-/- mice have anterior homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton that are milder than those seen in gdf11-/- mice  <cit> . the acvr2+/- acvr2b-/- axial skeletal pattern closely phenocopies that of gdf11-/- mice  <cit>  suggesting that both acvr <dig> and acvr2b are receptors for gdf <dig>  these data suggest therapeutic strategies that target both acvr <dig> and acvr2b receptor function or myostatin and other tgfβ growth factors with similar functions would lead to greater increases in muscle mass than targeting either acvr2b or myostatin alone.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that myostatin and gdf <dig> have redundant functions in regulating skeletal patterning in mice. we did not, however, find evidence that gdf <dig> is the tgfβ family member that is redundant to myostatin in regulation of skeletal muscle size. to determine the therapeutic strategy that results in the greatest potential increase in muscle mass, it will be important to identify the other tgfβ family members that negatively regulate skeletal muscle mass.
