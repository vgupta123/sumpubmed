BACKGROUND
in south america, horses are represented by two groups: equidiforms and hippidiforms. hippidion are characterized by a retracted nasal notch which has been interpreted as an adaptation to the presence of a proboscis and limbs with robust metapodials. the upper teeth present an elongate-oval protocone with simple enamel plication and lower teeth have a deep ectoflexid, penetrating the isthmus . on the other hand, in equus  a retracted nasal notch is not present and the metapodials are slender. the upper teeth present a triangular protocone and multiple internal posfossette plications. there are features that are common to both of these groups, such as differentiation into horses of both small and large body size, which are possibly a consequence of convergence due to adaptation to similar environments. the three species of hippidiforms are included within the genus hippidion owen,  <dig>  <cit>  whereas the five species of equidiforms are included in the subgenus equus   <cit> . each of these groups has different ecological adaptations that are evident in the cranial morphology, robustness of the limbs and body size  <cit> .

a technique that has proven useful for investigating the ecology of fossil horses is through examination of stable isotope values found in teeth and bone in combination with dental wear  <cit> . isotopic analyses can reveal information about resource use and resource partitioning among species and is also able to determine diet and habitat use  <cit> . here, we will address:  whether stable isotope values permit identification of resource use and partitioning among horse species and  if resource use and partitioning are determined, do the results support the ecology predicted by morphology or body size? finally, we compare carbon isotope values and evaluate the hypothesis that dietary niches, inferred from the mean and variation of carbon isotope values, did not change throughout time in the same latitude.

stable carbon and oxygen isotopes are incorporated into the tooth and bone apatite of horses and are representative, respectively, of the food and water consumed while alive. the carbon isotope ratio is influenced by the type of plant material ingested, which is in turn influenced by the photosynthetic pathway utilized by the plants. during photosynthesis, c <dig> plants in terrestrial ecosystems  discriminate more markedly against the heavy 13c isotope during fixation of co <dig> than c <dig> plants . thus c <dig> and c <dig> plants have distinct δ13c values. c <dig> plants usually have δ13c values of - <dig> per mil  to -22‰, with an average of approximately -26‰, whereas c <dig> plants have δ13c values of - <dig> to -10‰, with an average of about -12‰  <cit> . animals incorporate carbon isotopes from food into their teeth and bone with an additional fractionation of ~ <dig> to 14‰  <cit> . mammals feeding on c <dig> plants characteristically have δ13c values between - <dig> and -8‰, while animals that eat c <dig> tropical grasses have δ13c values between + <dig> and -2‰. a mixed-feeder would fall somewhere in between these two extremes  <cit> . hence, the relative proportions of c <dig> and c <dig> vegetation in the diet of an animal can be determined by analyzing the δ <dig> c value of its teeth and bones.

a number of previous studies have used the carbon and oxygen isotopic abundance of fossils and paleosols from south america to reconstruct the diets of extinct herbivores and the paleoenvironmental parameters of ancient terrestrial communities and ecosystems  <cit> . carbon isotope data for horses from south america have been presented in several papers  <cit> . in  <dig>  macfadden et al.  <cit>  presented the ancient distributions and latitudinal gradients of c <dig> and c <dig> grasses based on isotopic data from new world pleistocene horses. in addition, some papers have investigated the application of geochemical techniques in conjunction with morphological and dental wear data to reconstruct the feeding ecology and niche characterization of individual species  <cit> .

all equid taxa from south america were sampled for teeth  and bone  stable carbon and oxygen isotopes . additional data of thirty samples were taken from macfadden et al.  <cit> . together the data represent five species within the subgenus equus : e.  andium, e.  insulatus, e.  neogeus, e.  santaeelenae and e.  lasallei  <cit> . the genus hippidion includes three species: h. principale, h. devillei and h. saldiasi  <cit> . some of these valid species have a wide geographical distribution whilst others, such as e.  andium and e.  insulatus, are restricted to the andes region. in contrast, e.  neogeus, e.  santaeelenae and e.  lasallei are found in the non-andean tropical or subtropical regions of south america such as argentina, uruguay, colombia, brazil, and the coastal area of ecuador . h. saldiasi is restricted to a particular habitat in southern patagonia  <cit> ; while h. principale and h. devillei come from different localities in south america, such as tarija in bolivia and the pampa region in argentina, that cover a broad range of altitudes from  <dig> to  <dig> m. one restriction to our study is the chronological control of the sample. most of the samples were collected from old museum collections in ecuador, bolivia and argentina. these old collections were recovered without sufficient stratigraphic control. anyway we considered this limitation may condition the interpretations about altitudinal and latitudinal gradients for fossil samples, but do not invalidate the suggested patterns.

methods
materials
fossil samples were collected from specimens stored at the following institutions in argentina: museo de la plata, museo argentino de ciencias naturales "bernardino rivadavia" in buenos aires and museo de ciencias naturales y antropológicas "juan cornelio moyano"in mendoza. museo de la escuela politécnica nacional of quito, in ecuador. the museum specimen number, locality, country, age, skeletal tissue  and the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution of each sample are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we analyzed  <dig> samples of hippidion and  <dig> carbon and oxygen isotope composition samples of equus . additional  <dig> samples values  were taken from macfadden et al.  <cit>  and macfadden and shockey  <cit> .

pre-treatment of the samples
the samples were finely ground in an agate mortar. the chemical pre-treatment of the samples was carried out as described in koch et al.  <cit>  in order to eliminate secondary carbonate. about 40- <dig> mg of powdered enamel and bone samples were soaked in 2% naocl for three days at room temperature to oxidize organic matter. residues were rinsed and centrifuged five times with de-ionized water, and then treated with buffered 1m acetic acid for one day to remove diagenetic carbonates. pre-treatment of the enamel was slightly different because samples were soaked in 2% naocl for only one day.

analysis of the samples
carbon dioxide was obtained by reacting about 40- <dig> mg of the treated powder with 100% h3po <dig> for five hours at 50°c. the carbon dioxide was then isolated cryogenically in a vacuum line. results are reported as δ =  ×  <dig>  where r = 13c/12c or 18o/16o, and the standards are pdb for carbon and v-smow for oxygen. we have applied the data corrections for calcite from koch et al.  <cit>  to calculate the magnitude of the oxygen isotopic fractionation between apatite co <dig> and h3po <dig> at 50°c. the analytical variation for repeated analyses was  <dig> ‰ for δ13c and  <dig> ‰ for δ18o. for the analysis of phosphate we followed the chemical treatment procedure described by tudge  <cit> , which resulted in the precipitation of the phosphate ions in the form of bipo <dig>  co <dig> was obtained by reacting bipo <dig> with brf <dig> as described by longinelli  <cit> . all the samples were run in duplicate and the reported results are the mean of at least two consistent results. the analytical precision for repeated analyses was  <dig> ‰.

we performed both parametric  and nonparametric  statistical tests to evaluate δ13c and δ18o differences in middle and late pleistocene populations. spss  <dig>  software was used for the statistical analysis.

RESULTS
preservation state of the enamel, dentine and bone in the specimens analyzed
we checked the diagenetic alteration between the different skeletal tissues under the assumption that primary values were similar between different skeletal tissues from one individual. the phosphate oxygen isotope composition is usually considered to be more robust against diagenetic alteration than the carbonate oxygen at least if no bacteria are involved during the alteration processes. we measured both δ18o co <dig> and δ18o po <dig> values on the same specimens and obtained a regression between both, and compared those with known isotope equilibrium-relationships for biogenic apatite of modern bones and teeth  <cit> . if samples fall in the range of modern biogenic apatite this would argue for a preservation of primary δ18o co <dig> and δ18o po <dig> values, and thus likely also δ13c values as they are less easily altered than δ18o co <dig> values. this was taken as an indicator that even the bone and dentine samples may be reasonably well-preserved and can be interpreted to infer feeding ecology and habitat use of these ancient horses.

several authors  <cit>  suggest a high correlation between these two phases in some european and north american equids. in south america, the equation obtained for equus from argentina  <cit>  was: δ18o co <dig> =  <dig>  δ18o po <dig> +  <dig> ; r <dig> =  <dig> . more recently, sánchez et al.  <cit>  also found that a significant relationship existed between the δ18o results in the carbonate and phosphate apatite phases  when they analyzed the oxygen isotopic composition of gomphotheres from several south american localities. the new data shows that δ18o po <dig> and δ18o co <dig> are highly correlated, with the latter being about  <dig>  ‰ more positive than the former.

we analyzed the δ18o po <dig> and δ18o co <dig> of the  <dig> samples for hippidion and  <dig> samples for equus  in this way. the results of δ18o po <dig> versus v-smow standard are reported in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the analytical variation for repeated analysis was  <dig> ‰. each pair of δ18o values of teeth and bone belonged to the same individual, generally from the jaw or maxilla, the correlation being: δ18o po <dig> =  <dig>  δ18o co <dig> -  <dig> ; r <dig> =  <dig> . we also calculated the correlation between pairs of δ18o po <dig> - δ18o co <dig> values for the enamel, dentine, and bone, from the same individual. the results are plotted in figure  <dig>  the correlations between the different po4-co <dig> pairs are:

enamel δ18o po <dig> =  <dig>  δ18o co <dig> -  <dig>  r <dig> =  <dig> ; dentine δ18o po <dig> =  <dig>  δ18o co <dig> -  <dig>  r <dig> =  <dig> ; and bone δ18o po <dig> =  <dig>  δ18o co <dig> -  <dig>  r <dig> =  <dig> . in the first case it appears that the sample might have been modified by diagenesis because the carbonate results among the three skeletal phases  are different. in fact, the range of variation is  <dig> ‰ in the δ18o po <dig> and  <dig> ‰ in the δ18o co <dig> for the samples from the same specimen. results of δ13c obtained from the bone are similar to those obtained from the dentine and are, in general, equal or more negative than results obtained from the enamel. we observed the same pattern in the δ18o results as we did in the δ13c results. the range of variation between the three skeletal phases  was small and we suppose that they have not been significantly altered by diagenesis. for these reasons, we consider these δ13c values as representative of each group of horses.

dietary partitioning
the carbon isotopic ratio of equus  and hippidion remains indicate significant ecological differences . the hippidion samples analyzed here are more homogeneous than the equus  samples, with a δ13c range between - <dig>  and - <dig>  ‰ .

all the species of hippidion were almost exclusively c <dig> feeders but some individuals from bolivia and argentina fall at the lower end of the mixed c3/c <dig> range. for instance, h. principale from the eastern corridor  and h. devillei from the andes corridor yield similar δ13c values suggesting that they ate mainly c <dig> plants. the same pattern of dietary partitioning was obtained when comparisons were made between the same taxa at different latitudes . from the upper pliocene  to the lower pleistocene  the dietary partitioning remains similar. the same pattern in dietary partitioning is observed throughout the middle to late pleistocene  showing a predominance of c <dig> plants. also, we did not find differences between h. saldiasi from the ultima esperanza in southern patagonia and the other hippidion species present at different localities across south america.

equus species have predominantly been grazers, and as such, carbon isotopic values provide evidence of the c <dig> and c <dig> grasses. the carbon isotope data indicates that equus  shows three different patterns of dietary partitioning. samples of e.  neogeus from the province of buenos aires indicate a preference for c <dig> plants in the diet. the samples from ecuador and bolivia  show a preference for a diet of mixed c3-c <dig> plants, while those from la carolina , bolivia, and brazil are mostly c <dig> feeders.

as mentioned before, a few outliers  cannot be easily explained. these extremely high δ13c values  cannot be explained by consumption of c <dig> vegetation, which should impart an upper limit of about 3‰. these outliers could be the result from one of several possibilities, such as individuals living in costal peninsula areas of ecuador during the time in which c <dig> grasses were abundant and may have produced δ13c values not observed in the modern ecosystem, or the sample presents taphonomic alteration. specimen number v. <dig> has a high variation between dentine, enamel, and bone . macfadden et al  <cit>  obtained a δ13c value of  <dig> ‰ for the enamel of the same specimen but obtained  <dig> ‰ for the enamel of specimen number v. <dig> from the same locality. a more definitive explanation for these outliers must await the analysis of additional samples from these regions.

the δ18o co <dig> results of the horse remains differ according to altitudinal and latitudinal distribution. there is a clear difference in the δ18o values obtained from the populations from the lower plains and those from high elevations. the lowest δ18o co <dig> values are found in high elevation species from ecuador and bolivia  and range from  <dig>  to  <dig> ‰ with an average of around 25‰. the h. saldiasi samples from southern patagonia are also included in this group, their low δ18o values being caused by the effects of altitude and latitude. the second group is mostly represented by e.  neogeus, h. principale and h. devillei. these species come from the province of buenos aires, brazil, and bolivia. the distribution values range from  <dig>  to  <dig> ‰ with an average of around 30‰. the highest values come from the carolina peninsula in ecuador, with δ18o co <dig> maximum of  <dig> ‰.

discussion
areas of sympatry
as might be expected from ecological theory, finer-scale preliminary results from this study suggest feeding and niche differentiation within coexisting horses. hippidion and equus  are sympatric in the same stratigraphic level in two localities: tarija  in bolivia and the pampas in argentina . data from both localities suggest some difference in dietary partitioning. in a previous study, macfadden and shockey  <cit>  presented carbon isotopic results from tarija herbivores that, based on dental morphology, span the spectrum from presumed browsers  to presumed grazers  coexisting in the same localities. they suggested than the horses clearly occupied different dietary niches and can be separated using the carbon isotopes and hypsodonty index. hippidion is the least hypsodont taxon and has the most negative mean δ13c value, whereas the relatively hypsodont equus has the most positive mean δ13c value. as has been shown in another article  <cit> , equus is usually among the most grazing adapted mammalian herbivore in pleistocene terrestrial ecosystems. this position in the herbivore community is similar at tarija, whereas hippidion are more adapted to the browsing end of the spectrum and equus are primarily c <dig> grazers based on their carbon isotopic signature.

our data suggests that the range of δ13c values for h. devillei and h. principale from tarija falls in the low end of the mixed c3/c <dig> range , whereas e.  insulatus falls in the higher end . there is some overlap with at least the two values of - <dig>  and - <dig> ‰ indicating some differences in isotopic niche, with h. devillei consuming less grass than e.  insulatus at this place and time  <cit> .

in the data from arroyo tapalque , one of the localities in the pampas, the range of δ13c values for h. principale  and e.  neogeus  do not overlap, but both are close that they suggest the same pattern of dietary partitioning as in tarija.

if we look at the morphology, these taxa are very different. several previous papers based on cranial and limb morphology associate these differences with browsing and grazing diet preference . in general, the teeth of equus  are more hypsodont than hippidion, and the enamel patterns are more complicated in equus .

another difference between sympatric species is body sizes. for instance, h. principale and e.  neogeus are sympatric in the pampas in argentina. both have a large body size, adapted to open habitat, but they differ in body mass   <cit> . the skulls of e.  neogeus are big and show an enlarged preorbital and nasal region. the limb bones are large and robust, but more slender than in the other south american equus species  <cit> . on the other hand, h. principale has a retracted nasal notch might signify some sort of proboscis. the skeleton is large and bulky, and the extremities are robust, mainly the metapodials and phalanges. it is the largest and strongest of the south american hippidiforms. these characteristics are classically associated with dietary and habitat preferences. the morphology indicated that h. principale may have been a browser but was able to live in open grasslands and that e.  neogeus is the most hypsodont horse, and has the relatively straight muzzle characteristic of grazing horses  <cit> .

the effect of latitude
some of the most fundamental patterns in global biogeography are those that are structured by the latitudinal gradients that extend from pole to equator . the proportion of c <dig> to c <dig> grasses in most modern ecosystems rises with increasing latitude. c <dig> grasses are predominant  in high-latitude steppes and prairies, whereas c <dig> grasses are predominant  in most low-elevation, and equatorial grasslands. the transition between c <dig> and c <dig> dominance in grasslands occurs at about 40-45° latitude in the northern hemisphere  <cit> . exceptions to this general rule include grasses at high-elevations or in climates with cool-growing seasons , where the grasses are predominantly c <dig> regardless of latitude  <cit> , and the occasional c <dig> grass species that are found in arctic regions  <cit> .

macfadden et al.  <cit>  used the pleistocene distribution of equus  in the americas to present a general δ13c gradient that seems to be symmetrical on either side of the equator. they found that the isotopic transition between a full c <dig> signal and full c <dig> signal is observed at about 45°n in the northern hemisphere. although there are considerably fewer data points in the southern hemisphere they  <cit>  have found a signal of exclusively c <dig> feeders at around 35°s . a similar pattern in the southern hemisphere was found by sánchez et al.  <cit>  in the distribution of gomphotheres in south america. samples of gomphotheres from the province of buenos aires, at around 39°s latitude show a mean δ13c value of - <dig> ‰, while samples from chile  show a mean δ13c value of - <dig> ‰. this fact would confirm the existence of a latitudinal gradient for the southern hemisphere, and places the transition between a full c <dig> signal and mixed c3/c <dig> signal around 35° to 41°s.

the new data for the genus equus  analyzed in this paper are in agreement with the δ13c latitudinal pattern postulated by macfadden et al.  <cit> , while data for hippidion also seem to follow a clear pattern. samples of hippidion show a boundary between an exclusively c <dig> to a mixed c3/c <dig> diet at tarija , but in this case there is an effect of altitude combined with latitude. at the highest latitude specimens from patagonia , the mean value is - <dig> ‰. the middle latitude samples, from the province of buenos aires , show δ13c values that range between - <dig>  and - <dig> ‰, while the lowest latitude specimens, from tarija , show δ13c values that range between - <dig>  to - <dig> ‰.

altitudinal gradient
there are also significant differences between the δ18o co <dig> values for the two genera, even when the range of δ18o values for high altitude and equatorial samples are taken into account . this demonstrates the effects of an altitudinal gradient. the hippidion specimens from the andes corridor  and the equus  specimens from ecuador and bolivia show the lowest values . on the other hand, samples from around  <dig> m of altitude  present values that correspond with more temperate conditions . the effects of low altitude and latitude on δ18o co <dig> may also explain the higher value obtained for the samples from la carolina, ecuador , where samples showed δ18o values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ‰.

results of tests performed on twelve possible paired comparisons between two genera of south american equids. the definition of groups is the same as for table  <dig>  p: significance level. p <  <dig>  in bold.

we calculated a regression of δ18o po <dig> values with altitude to quantify the effects of altitude. bryant et al.  <cit>  suggest a high correlation between δ18o po <dig> and δ18o co <dig> in miocene north american equids. we found a good correlation between δ18o po <dig> values and altitude. the equation obtained was: δ18o po <dig> = - <dig>  altitude +  <dig>  . we obtained an altitudinal gradient of - <dig>  δ unit/ <dig> meters.

an important point concerns altitudinal gradients. it seems that the horses living at high altitudes,  <dig> up to  <dig> m above sea level, and at low to middle latitude  still have a c <dig> component in their diet. this is not surprising at all given the distribution of modern c <dig> plants in the central andes. at present, three c <dig> amaranthaceae species occur at high elevations  where c <dig> plants are rarely observed and the altitude record reported for any confirmed c <dig> species worldwide is  <dig> m for the grass muhlenbergia peruviana  <cit> . however, this is not true for our specimens from  <dig> m, which have a pure c <dig> diet. in this central andean region, a clear altitudinal vegetation gradient is present. subparamo  presents mosaics where shrubs and small trees which alternate with grasslands; and paramo proper , is dominated by grasslands and shows patches of woody species which occur only in sheltered locations and along water streams. this altitudinal vegetation gradient changed during the pleistocene. the treeless vegetation above the upper forest line was most widespread during glacial times, whereas it was limited to small areas on mountain tops during interglacial times  <cit> . the fossil pollen records show that such oscillations in patterns of plant distribution were repeated many times during the pleistocene ice ages  <cit> . during the last glacial maximum, when atmospheric pco <dig> was reduced by some 50%, c <dig> plants dominated the paramo vegetation, while only the highest mountain tops were covered by c <dig> grasses because of the low temperatures. such small patches of c4-rich vegetation are probably relicts from the last ice age during which paramo vegetation was mainly composed of small tussocks and tufts of c <dig> grasses  <cit> .

the change in altitudinal vegetation gradients during the pleistocene is one of several possibilities to explain the c <dig> dietary component in horses living at high altitudes. another alternative explanation might be that the horses partially fed at lower altitudes.

CONCLUSIONS
based on modern analogues, pleistocene horses are inferred to be grazers but none of the grazing horses were interpreted as consumers of only c <dig> grasses. our data shows that equus  had three different patterns of dietary partitioning. e.  neogeus from the province buenos aires indicates a preference for c <dig> plants. e.  andium from ecuador and e.  insulatus from bolivia show a preference in a mixed diet of c3-c <dig> plants, while e.  santaeelenae from la carolina  and brazil are mostly c <dig> feeders. these results confirm that ancient feeding ecology cannot always be inferred from dental morphology.

the record from south america suggests that hippidion is in general a higher latitude taxon than equus . the highest latitude occurrence of hippidion appears to be in southern bolivia, in contrary to equus  where the occurrences are further north, and alone goes a long way in explaining the isotopic differences.

the data for hippidion indicates a preference for c <dig> plants and mixed c3-c <dig> plants, but most of this data came from high altitude or latitude specimens. one possible, but unconfirmed explanation is that hippidion were living in a "c <dig> world" and were browsers as indicated by their morphology, but more southern individuals were living at latitudes high enough to support c <dig> and c <dig> grasses.

the current study demonstrates the utility of using wide-ranging fossil mammals to explore latitudinal gradients and patterns of c3/c <dig> grass distribution and continental palaeotemperature during the pleistocene. the carbon isotope composition of horses decreased as latitude increased. in equus  we found a change in signal between a mixed c3/c <dig> diet and a pure c <dig> diet around 32°s and a boundary between mixed diet and exclusively c <dig> signals at 35°s.

we also found that the horses living at high altitudes and at low to middle latitudes still have a c <dig> component in their diet, except for those specimens living at  <dig> m, which have a pure c <dig> diet. the change in altitudinal vegetation gradients during the pleistocene is one of several possibilities to explain the c <dig> dietary component in horses that lived at high altitudes. another alternative explanation implies that the horses fed partially at lower altitudes.
