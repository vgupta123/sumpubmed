BACKGROUND
due to the reproduction, nutrition, proliferation, and protection needs between insects and plants, an interactive relationship has been established. plants also produce constitutive and inducible defense mechanisms. the constitutive defense mechanisms refer to the plants’ own existence materials which inhibit harmful organism infestations  <cit> . the induced defense mechanisms reflect a type of special insect resistance characteristic when herbivorous insects infect plants  <cit> . it is one of the important defensive measures by which to explore the regulation mechanisms of plant resistance to pest under the condition of pest persecution at the protein level, such as soybean response to prodenia litura  <cit> , rice response to brown planthopper  , and arabidopsis thaliana response to plutella xylostella  <cit> , the research of all of which has achieved various degrees of conclusive results.


lamprosema indicate  belongs to the lepidoptera and pyralidae groups. it is an important soybean leaf feeding pest, whose larvae lurk inside soybean leaves, cause leaf curling and feed on leaf tissues. this feeding affects the plants’ photosynthesis, and causes abnormal growth  <cit> . these infestation disasters have occurred in jilin, southern of liaoning, and the eastern regions of sichuan in china. they can occur over multiple generations of plants in 1 year in central and southern china. in the event of serious pest damaged years, only veins and petioles have been left on the blades, thereby causing serious yield losses  <cit> . relevant research has been reported in regard to the resource excavations of soybeans’ resistance to lamprosema indicata  <cit> , resistance identification  <cit> , inheritance of the resistance  <cit>  and related gene qtl locations  <cit> . however, the results of proteomics research which has focused on soybeans’ resistance to lamprosema indicata has not yet been made available.

in this study, soybeans with high resistance and susceptibility to lamprosema indicata were selected as the research objects. the protein expression abundance was analyzed for the soybean following the lamprosema indicata feeding using the itraq-mrm technology. the related proteins’ resistances to lamprosema indicate were identified. the analysis explored how these proteins participated in the responses to resistance, and aimed at resolving the soybeans’ constitutive and inducible defense mechanisms in response to lamprosema indicate at the proteomic level. the results of this study provided a new perspective for the development of the germplasm innovation of soybeans’ resistance to lamprosema indicata, as well as genetic improvement and new species breeding.

RESULTS
basic protein identification information
in this study, itraq technology was used to analyze and compare the different accumulated proteins in different resistant soybean before and after lamprosema indicate feeding. a total of  <dig>  spectra were obtained, in which  <dig>  spectra were matched to the known soybean spectra in the reference genomes using mascot software . among these,  <dig>  were found to be unique spectra. here,  <dig>  peptides were identified, with  <dig>  unique peptides and  <dig> proteins . the results declared that the itraq has high degree of sensitivity, it can get more comprehensive information than other technique when used to analyze the proteins in plants.

whole distribution of the proteomics
the statistical analyses of all of the proteins were conducted according to the relative molecular weights . the results showed that the proteins’ molecular weight distributions which were identified by itraq were relatively broad, and covered the sizes of the different proteins. the analysis of the lengths of all the peptides which were identified by itraq showed that most of the lengths were 7–19 kda, among which the highest area of distribution was 8–13 kda . the distribution of the protein sequence coverage was analyzed for all of the proteins identified by itraq . the results showed that itraq was able to cover the majority of the expressed proteins. the majority of the identified proteins showed better peptide coverage, of which 52% of the identified proteins had more than 10% of the peptide coverage, and 27% have more than 20% of the peptide coverage. the peptide number analysis for the proteins identified by itraq showed that the peptide segment numbers in most of the proteins were identified to contain less than  <dig>  and the number of proteins decreased with the increased number of matched peptides . among these, more than  <dig> %  of the protein contained at least two peptide segments, which suggested that the proteins’ isolation and identification were satisfactory. these results indicated that the data qualified for further analysis.fig.  <dig> protein mass distribution. note: the x axis represents the molecular weights  of the identified proteins, and the y axis represents the number of proteins

repeatability analysis
when the level of variation was 20%, the summation of the proportion of the numbers of proteins at different levels of variation accounted for the total number of proteins reaching more than  <dig> , which was considered as high repeatability. in this study, the analysis of two biological replicates in four comparative groups showed that, when the level of variation was 20%, the summations of the proportion of the numbers of proteins at different levels of variation accounted for the total number of proteins were greater than  <dig> , indicating that this research showed high repeatability .fig.  <dig> repeatability analysis. a. cv_hr48/hr0_combine, b. cv_hs48/hs0_combine, c. cv_hr0/hs0_combine, d. cv_hr48/hs48_combine. note: the horizontal axis represents the different levels of variation; the left vertical axis indicates the numbers of the quantitative proteins at different levels of variation and the corresponding column; and the right vertical axis represents the summation of the proportion of the number of proteins at different levels of variation, which accounted for the total number of proteins, along with the corresponding line chart. hr represents the highly resistant line of the gantai-2-2; hs represents the highly susceptible line of the wan 82–178; and  <dig>   <dig> indicate that the soybean samples were treated with lamprosema indicate at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively




analysis of the differentially expressed proteins 
a total of  <dig> non-redundant proteins were detected by itraq, among which, 3252proteins were quantified . the experimental results showed that  <dig> deps were identified compared gantai-2- <dig>  with wan 82– <dig>  at 0 h feeding, of which  <dig> proteins were up-regulated and  <dig> proteins were down-regulated. also,  <dig> deps were identified in the gantai-2- <dig> compared 48 h feeding with 0 h feeding, including  <dig> up-regulated proteins and  <dig> down-regulated proteins. and,  <dig> deps were identified in the wan 82– <dig> compared 48 h feeding with 0 h feeding, including  <dig> up-regulated proteins and  <dig> down-regulated proteins.

the deps in the above three alignment programs were further divided into three classes. the first class was the “deps with non-lamprosema indicate induced genotype”, there were  <dig> deps in total. this class of proteins was the “deps identified in the gantai-2- <dig> compared to the wan 82– <dig> before lamprosema indicate feeding induction”, in which four were always up-regulated and three were always down-regulated at 0 h and 48 h. in addition, one protein was up-regulated at 0 h, but down-regulated at 48 h, while the other  <dig> proteins displayed no changes at 48 h. the second type of proteins were known as the “worm-induced deps which appeared in both genotypes”, and included  <dig> deps in total. these mainly presented an up-regulated trend, including  <dig> proteins which were up-regulated and  <dig> proteins which were down-regulated. the third class of proteins was the “lamprosema indicate-induced genotype deps”, which contained  <dig> proteins. these proteins appeared only in the highly resistant material or only in the highly susceptible material, including  <dig> deps found only in the gnatai-2- <dig> and  <dig> deps found only in the wan 82– <dig>  in this study, a total of  <dig> deps in the three classes of induced proteins.

a comparison was made of the lamprosema indicate feeding at 0 h and 48 h. the numbers of up-regulated proteins were all greater than the down-regulated proteins in the different resistance materials, which indicated that the lamprosema indicate feeding induced a certain protein expression. this protein expression improved the soybean’s resistance to insects. the total number of deps in the highly susceptible material were found to be more than in the highly resistant material, which indicated that it has its own characteristics for highly resistant and highly susceptible soybean in response to lamprosema indicate feeding induced reactions. also, soybean with different resistant levels may use different defense strategies in response to insects, in which highly susceptible soybean boost more of the proteins involved in the responses to pest stresses.

dep cluster analysis
the dep clustering results showed that the four comparison groups were divided into two modules . the first shows that the entire expression styles of hr48/hr <dig> and hs48/hs <dig> were similar. the second module shows that the entire expression styles of hr0/hs <dig> and hr48/hs <dig> were similar, namely for lamprosema indicate before and after feeding, the expression patterns of the deps between two genotypes were similar. these similarities mainly showed that the up- or down-regulation occurred at the same time. this indicated that two kinds of genotypes all exhibited insect-induced deps after the lamprosema indicate feeding, which can respond to the stress of insects, and achieve the purpose of defense insects. in addition, the resistant material itself contains a protein which protects against pests.fig.  <dig> thedeps function clustering analysis of four comparison groups. note: the fold changes of deps were presented with different colors, red represents down-regulated; green up-regulated. hr represents the highly resistant line of the gantai-2-2; hs represents the highly susceptible line of the wan 82–178; and  <dig>   <dig> indicate that the soybean samples were treated with lamprosema indicate at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively




gene ontology  enrichment analysis for all deps
to further analyze the subcellular localization, molecular functions and biological processes of the deps, go annotation analysis was performed on the  <dig> deps using blast2go v <dig>  software. the results showed that  <dig> deps  had been annotated into  <dig> functional groups, including  <dig> biological processes,  <dig> cellular components, and  <dig> molecular functions . in the biological processes, the deps were mainly involved in metabolic, cellular, responses to stimulus, single-organism processes, and so on. in the cellular components, the deps were mainly focused on the cells, cell parts, organelle, membranes, organelle parts, and so on. in the molecular functions, the deps were mainly involved in catalytic activities, binding, antioxidant activities and structural molecule activities. these results indicated that the lamprosema indicate response proteins were mainly involved in stress and responses to biotic stimuli, primary metabolic processes, cellular, and so on. we concluded that when the soybean was harmed by the lamprosema indicate, the defense systems in the plants would immediately respond to the stimuli, appropriately increase the metabolic activities in vivo, and produce defense substances, as well as enhancing the activities of various enzymes to promote defense.fig.  <dig> go enrichment for all of the identified deps. note: the x axis represents each go term, and the y axis represents the enrichment ratio of the deps in each of the major classes




clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  function analysis for all of the deps
a cog enrichment analysis for the  <dig> deps was conducted using blastx  <dig> .24+ software. the results showed that  <dig> deps  were annotated to  <dig> cog categories , among which six were annotated to more deps, including energy production and conversion , translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , general function prediction only , lipid transport and metabolism , posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones , and inorganic ion transport and metabolism . the results speculated that most of deps related to lamprosema indicate stress were mainly concentrated in these six functional categories. the signal transduction mechanisms , secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism , cell wall, membrane and envelope biogenesis , rna processing and modification  and chromatin structure and dynamics , were annotated to fewer of deps. these results indicated that most of the deps were contained nearly every aspect of soybean metabolism and growth.fig.  <dig> cog functional classes of all of the identified deps. note: the capital letters in the x axis represent the cog categories on the right of column, and the y axis represents the number of deps




kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  enrichment analysis of all of the deps
a kegg pathway enrichment analysis of the  <dig> deps was carried out in a kegg pathway database using blast_v <dig> . <dig> software. the results showed that  <dig> deps  were annotated to  <dig> kegg pathways, and the metabolic pathways  were the primary pathway enrichment. the second were the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolite . based on the kegg enrichment analysis, it was found that the deps participated in the following resistant related pathways, such as ribosome , linoleic acid metabolism , flavonoid biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , peroxisome , stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis , glutathione metabolism , pant hormone signal transduction , and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis . the pathway analysis showed that the lamprosema indicate induced the deps in the metabolic pathways were related to the resistance, they played a defensive role against the insect stress.

in the kegg pathway enrichment process, an r language was used for the hyper geometric algorithm. the functions of the deps were determined for the classification of the pathways . the deps functions were mainly involved in metabolism, including the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, along with amino acid, energy, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolisms, and other metabolic processes. the second were genetic information processing, including translation, transcription, folding, sorting and degradation. other functions, such as signal transduction, transport and catabolism, and environmental adaptation, occupied a lower proportion of the deps. there were related to the plants’ components. also, all of the functional material syntheses in the plants’ were required to be accomplished through metabolic processes. therefore, a large base existed for these proteins. we concluded that the lamprosema indicate activated both defense and tolerance responses, which in turn made large demands on metabolism. the results provided a basis to better understand the responses which the soybean made under the lamprosema indicate stress conditions.table  <dig> comparison of the deps of the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig> after the lamprosema indicate feeding

analysis of dep interaction network
the results of the dep interaction network showed that 48 h after lamprosema indicate feeding stress, compared to 0 h, the interaction network of identified part of the deps in the resistant material guantai-2- <dig>  was divided into three levels , i.e. gi| <dig> ,894|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,907|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,797|ref.|np_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,846|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,926|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,210|ref.|xp_ <dig> |  and gi| <dig> ,142|ref.|np_ <dig> | ; gi| <dig> ,232|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,142|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , and gi| <dig> ,873|ref.|np_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,108|ref.|xp_ <dig> | . the interaction network of the identified part of the deps in wan82– <dig>  was divided into five levels , namely gi| <dig> ,894|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,797|ref.|np_ <dig>  | , gi| <dig> ,535|ref.|np_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,166|ref.|xp_ <dig> |  and gi| <dig> ,874|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,815|ref.|xp_ <dig> | and gi| <dig> ,518|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,203|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,794|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,927|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,923|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,923|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , and gi| <dig> ,755|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,890|ref.|xp_ <dig> | . before lamprosema indicate feeding, the interaction network of part of the deps in the insect susceptible material  was divided into four levels when compared to insect resistant material  , namely gi| <dig> ,894|ref.|xp_ <dig> |, gi| <dig> ,213|ref.|xp_ <dig> | and gi| <dig> ,755|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,210|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,779|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,926|ref.|xp_ <dig> |  and gi| <dig> ,623|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , respectively; gi| <dig> ,324|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,890|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , gi| <dig> ,815|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,294|ref.|xp_ <dig> | , and gi| <dig> ,636|ref.|xp_ <dig> | interacted with gi| <dig> ,364|ref.|xp_ <dig> | . after the interaction of up and down regulation, the expression levels of gi| <dig> ,894|ref.|xp_ <dig> |, gi| <dig> ,213|ref.|xp_ <dig> | and gi| <dig> ,755|ref.|xp_ <dig> | were unchanged. it was speculated that this might act as a bridge or signal transduction in the middle part of the regulatory network. after the up or down regulation of single proteins, the other proteins, such as the expression levels of gi| <dig> ,232|ref.|xp_ <dig> |, gi| <dig> ,873|ref.|np_ <dig> |, gi| <dig> ,815|ref.|xp_ <dig> |, gi| <dig> ,518|ref.|xp_ <dig> |, etc. were unchanged. it was presumed that this was a result of invalid control or regulated by other factors, thus there was no significant change in expression. the results of this study showed that the difference expressions of related proteins in the soybean stimulated the regulation of lamprosema indicate feeding stress response, causing the plant body endocrine to create more antigen proteins, so as to resist the harm caused by the lamprosema indicate.fig.  <dig> network metabolic analysis for deps. a. hr48/hr <dig>  b. hs48/hs <dig>  c. hs0/hr <dig>  note: the fold changes of differential expressed proteins were presented with different colors, red represents down-regulated; green up-regulated. hr represents the highly resistant line of the gantai-2-2; hs represents the highly susceptible line of the wan 82–178; and  <dig>   <dig> indicate that the soybean samples were treated with lamprosema indicate at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively




validation of itraq data for selected candidate proteins by multiple reaction monitoring 
the reliability of the itraq results was verified by mrm. in accordance with the reported data results, as well as the different expression proteins analyses,  <dig> candidate deps which may have been related to resistance to lamprosema indicate were selected to establish an mrm method. skyline software was used to select peptides of the target proteins with a ms/ms spectral library  which were generated on a tripletof <dig>  search using mascot  against with a glycine_max database. among  <dig> target proteins,  <dig> proteins have ms/ms spectrum  and unique peptide . therefore, the mrm detection and analysis were performed for these  <dig> deps only . the results showed that the expression levels of the  <dig> deps in the different comparison programs were basically the same as in the itraq expression patterns . the difference between the levels of expression may have been due to the different detection methods. therefore, the mrm analysis confirmed that the itraq results were reliable.fig.  <dig> relative expression leves of selected proteins measured by itraq and mrm in the hr48/hr <dig>  hs48/hs <dig>  hr0/hs <dig> and hr48/hs <dig>  a. gi| <dig> ,155|ref.|np- <dig> |, b. gi| <dig> ,275|ref.|np- <dig> |, c. gi| <dig> ,717|ref.|np- <dig> |, d. gi| <dig> ,959|ref.|np- <dig> |, e. gi| <dig> ,075|ref.|xp- <dig> |, f. gi| <dig> ,656|ref.|np- <dig> |, g. gi| <dig> ,320|ref.|np- <dig> |. note: “*” means deps. hr represents the highly resistant line of the gantai-2-2; hs represents the highly susceptible line of the wan 82–178; and  <dig>   <dig> indicate that the soybean samples were treated with lamprosema indicate at  <dig> and 48 h, respectively




discussion
the different resistance soybeans formed self-defense proteins in order to avoid the insect herbivory attacks before lamprosema indicate feeding stress. also, after feeding some defense related proteins expressions were induced, which regulated the plants’ metabolic balance in order to achieve insect resistant reactions. for the purpose of more thoroughly understanding the protein expression levels in the soybean after the lamprosema indicate feeding for 0 h and 48 h, a differential proteomic analysis was conducted for the leaves of the highly resistant line  and the highly susceptible line  using itraq. a total of  <dig> deps were identified according to the standard threshold. then, based the biological information analyses of these deps, combined with the previously reported data, some of the deps were determined to be related to the lamprosema indicate.

deps associated with active oxygen scavenging
plants may be subjected to drought, high and low temperature, salt, plant disease and pest stress during their entire growth process. all of these can lead to the plants’ cells producing large amounts of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . ros are important signal molecules in plants, but can also cause plant toxicity. plants have formed a set of regulations and detoxification mechanisms, along with enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant protection systems, to remove the ros  <cit> .

peroxidase  is an important defense enzyme system in plants. it has the ability to catalyze the decomposition of h2o <dig> to remove the ros , which can be induced by insects in wheat  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and other crops. in this study, the peroxidase 12-like in the wan 82– <dig> was up-regulated compared 48 h with 0 h. it was speculated that this protein in the highly susceptible soybean had the ability to reduce the damage of the ros which was caused by the invasion of the pest.

ascorbate peroxidase  is a key enzyme in the h2o <dig> detoxification system, can catalyze cycle it plays the key role of catalyzing the asa-gsh cycle  <cit> . the apx isozymes in higher plants are divided into cytosolic apx , and chloroplasts apx , in which the capx are the main enzymes for responses to harsh environments  <cit> . caldwell et al.  <cit>  found that the transcription, translation, and post translation regulations of the capx in soybean could enhance its ability to resist environmental stress. yoshimura et al.  <cit>  determined that the absence of capx <dig> caused a breakdown of the chloroplast h2o <dig> clearance system. in this study, it was found that the expression level of the capx <dig> in the gantai-2- <dig> was always higher than that in the wan 82– <dig> at 0 h and 48 h. these results indicated that expression of capx <dig> can protect the important regions of the cells from oxidative stress, and strictly control the intracellular h2o <dig> levels in order to resist pest invasions  <cit> .

superoxide dismutase  in plants is a key enzyme in the removal of ros. it is an important protective enzyme in plants’ cell defense systems, and is closely related to the plants’ resistances  <cit> . depending on the combination of metal ions, sod can be divided into three types: cu/zn-sod, mn-sod, and fe-sod  <cit> . previous studies have confirmed that salt stress  <cit> , cucumber mosaic virus   <cit>  and plum pox virus   <cit>  can all induce the expression of sod in plants. also, oxidative stress, hormones, and salt stress adversity can induce the fe-sod expression in barley  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and other crops. the two fe-sod proteins in the gantai-2- <dig> were up-regulated compared 48 h with 0 h, and illustrated that the highly resistance materials under the lamprosema indicate stress can decrease the damages of the ros, then resist pests. also, the expression level of two fe-sod proteins in the wan 82– <dig> were always higher than that in the gantai-2- <dig> at 0 h and 48 h. therefore, a high expression of fe-sod in the highly susceptible soybean was determined to be a defense against pest invasion.

deps related to other secondary metabolite biosynthesis
cytochrome p <dig>  is a class of heme containing oxidoreductases. it can catalyze some substances with defensive functions, such as isoflavones, alkaloids, terpenoids, and so on  <cit> . it plays an important role in the defense against pests, as well as environmental stresses  <cit> . the products were catalyzed by cyp79a and cyp71e <dig> in a sorghum containing cyanide, which is toxic to insect pests  <cit> . the phytoalexins in arabidopsis were catalyzed by cyp71b <dig>  which can resist pathogen hazards  <cit> . transgenic maize expressing cytochrome p <dig> genes were able to avoid herbicide toxicity  <cit> . bphs can induce the cytochrome p <dig> expression in rice  <cit> . in this study, a cytochrome p <dig> 82a4-like was up-regulated in the wan 82– <dig> compared 48 h with 0 h. and it was found to be always higher in the gantai-2- <dig> than in the wan 82– <dig> at 0 h and 48 h. therefore, it speculated that the cytochrome p <dig> 82a4-like catalyzed the synthesis of the substances which were defending against the pest, and thereby caused harm to the insects or stopped the pests’ feeding.

one of the key enzymes in the ethylene biosynthesis of plants is 1-aminocyclopropane-1- carboxylate oxidase . the amount of ethylene production is mainly determined by the activity of the aco  <cit> . the aco is a multigene family encoding protein, which is regulated by the feedback regulation of the ethylene signaling  <cit> . ethylene, as a plant endogenous hormone, regulates the growth and development of plants, defense responses, and the synthesis of secondary metabolites  <cit> . it was found that the aco would be induced when peach was affected by wounding  <cit> . the ntaco <dig>  ntaco <dig> and ntaco <dig> in tobacco were induced during salt stress  <cit> . also, the aco in a wild type of arabidopsis was enhanced after being treated for salt resistance  <cit> . in this study, the aco in the wan 82– <dig> was up-regulated compared 48 h with 0 h. it was hypothesized that the pest stress inducted the aco expression, and produced a large amount of ethylene in order to improve the resistance abilities to the lamprosema indicate.

oas-tl is a key enzyme in the synthesis of cys, and it has been found to be closely related to the secondary metabolic synthesis of some plants  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the oas-tl isoenzymes in watermelon  <cit> , leucaena leucocephala  <cit>  and quisqulis indica  <cit>  can synthase toxic or anthelmintic beta heterocyclic rings, which replaced alanine and resisted pests. in this study, the expression level of the gmoastl <dig> in gantai-2- <dig> was found to always be higher than the wan 82– <dig> at 0 h and 48 h. these results suggested that it may synthase some of the secondary products resistance to lamprosema indicate feeding, or beta site heterocyclic substituted alanine and other substances. therefore, it plays a key role in the defense against lamprosema indicate.

deps associated with carbohydrate metabolism
glutamine synthetase  is the key enzyme of the nitrogen metabolisms in higher plants. it catalyzes the ammonium salt and glutamate to generate glutamine, providing needed nitrogen compounds for proline synthesis, which affects plant growth and development  <cit> . gs is divided into two categories, cytoplasmic or cytosolic types of gs , and plastid or chloroplast types of gs , in which the gs <dig> mainly produces glutamine to complete the transport of nitrogen between cells  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the gs <dig> isozyme is associated with plant disease and stress resistances. the expression of the gs <dig> isozyme was enhanced when the following plants suffered pathogen infections, drought, and other stresses: tomato  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . in this study, the gs <dig> isoform x <dig> was all up-regulated in the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h, which may have facilitated proline accumulation, in order to improve the osmotic adjustment abilities in the soybean leaves, as well as to activate the oxygen scavenging capacities against the lamprosema indicate feeding.

enolase is a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, and has the ability to catalyze the dehydration of phosphoglyceric acid to form phosphoenolpyruvic acid  <cit> . it has been reported that enolase is involved in stress responses, which can be induced by pest invasions, hypoxia, and cold stress in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and other plants. in this study, the enolase was up-regulated in the wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h. it was speculated that the expression changes of the enolase may promote the light respiration in the plants, thereby maintaining a dynamic equilibrium in order to resist pests  <cit> .

deps associated with jasmonic acid  signaling pathways
when plants are subjected to pest feeding or stress, they will be induced to produce jasmonic acid -mediated signaling pathways. ellis et al.  <cit>  found that aphid populations’ growth decreased significantly in the arabidopsis mutant cev <dig> when the ja signaling pathway was activated. these results indicated that ja limits the damage to plants caused by aphids. lipoxygenase  is the key enzyme in the synthesis of ja  <cit> , and also is an important signal factor in plants’ defense pathways  <cit> . when plants suffer pest infestations, pathogen infections, high temperature, and other stresses, the expression of single or multiple lox genes can be induced  <cit> . these have been induced by pests, water logging, hypoxia, or disease adversity stresses in the following plants: potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana , and citrus sinensis  <cit> , as well as other plants. constabel found that the lox activity increased rapidly, can led to a slowdown of the development speed of spodoptera exigua  <cit> . alpha-dioxygenase  is also able to catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids. the product of 2-hydrogen peroxide fatty acids is a new type of oxidation fatty acid, and is also an enzyme in the ja pathway  <cit> . some studies have indicated that α-dox is also related to plants’ resistances to pathogen invasions and insect attacks. α-dox <dig> or α-dox <dig> have been induced by plant diseases, insect pests, or adversity stresses in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . in this study, seven lox and one α-dox <dig> were all up-regulated in the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h. it was speculated that the linolenic acid in the soybean leaves was released from the membrane lipids during the damage caused by the pest invasion, and the ja and its derivatives were finally formed under the action of the lox and α-dox <dig>  <cit> . ja is a plant’s signal molecule caused by injury, herbivores, and pathogens  <cit> , and binding to a receptor can induce the expression of defense enzymes or proteins  <cit> . it was presumed the ja signaling pathway was involved in the responses to the lamprosema indicate defense in the plants.

deps related to genetic information processing
many defense related proteins are produced when plants are being damaged by insects, many of which are synthesized by the endoplasmic reticulum, and transported by the golgi apparatus to various parts of the cells  <cit> . in this study, protein disulfide-isomerase-like , pdi a <dig>  and calreticulin-3-like  were all involved in the process of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. the pdi which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum could catalyze the protein disulfide oxidation, reduction, and isomerization through the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide  <cit> . many previous studies have shown that pdi is involved in stress responses, such as drought, cold, and salt stresses, which have induced pdi expressions in corn  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . crt is a multifunctional ca2+ binding protein, and is mainly attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. crt is involved in plant stress responses under biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the crt was found to be up-regulated by mosaic virus infections or waterlogging stresses in soybean  <cit> . in this study, the pdi, pdi a <dig> and crt- <dig> in the wan 82– <dig> were all up-regulated, comparing 48 h with 0 h. therefore, it was speculated that the highly susceptible material activated the basic defense mechanisms after the lamprosema indicate feeding. however, other resistance mechanisms existed in the highly resistant material.

anti digestion proteins
lectins have at least one non-catalytic domain specific reversible binding to monosaccharide or oligosaccharide. when lectin is ingested by insects to induce local or systemic toxic effects, it may result in antifeedant, insect growth arrest, and even death  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the survival and reproductive rates were greatly reduced in heliothis virescens  <cit> , myzus persicae  <cit> , lacanobia oleracea  <cit> , and other insects, which fed on transgenic plants expressing the lectin. transgenic tobacco which expressed soybean lectin enhanced its resistance capacity to pathogens and pests  <cit> . in this study, the lectin precursor was all up-regulated in the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h. presumably, the lectin precursor was released from soybean victims’ cells, and then combined to the chitin of the insects’ peritrophic membranes, and sugar-based compounds and glycosylation of digestive enzymes in epithelial cells of the digestive tract, thereby affecting the normal absorption of nutrients, disorders in the digestive tract were also induced, and bacterial multiplication in the digestive tract was promoted, causing insect growth inhibition or death, which achieved the defensive purpose of killing the pests  <cit> .

trypsin inhibitors can significantly inhibit the protease activities in insects’ guts, and hinder the insects’ digested protein. they have especially strong inhibitory effects on lepidopteran insects . the insects which have fed on trypsin inhibitors and have suffered from malnutrition and even increased mortality include tribolium castaneum  <cit> , spodopera exigua  <cit> , heliothis zea  <cit> , callosobruchus maculates  <cit> , apis mellifera  <cit> , and so on. in this study, trypsin inhibitor, trypsin inhibitor a-like and kunitz trypsin protease inhibitor-like precursors, were all up-regulated in the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h, which may have caused the proteolytic enzyme activities in the insects’ guts to decrease significantly, as well as disturbing the normal metabolisms of the insects.

deps associated with resistance to lamprosema indicate
pr- <dig> proteins are a class of the prs protein family, and play a very important role in plants’ resistances to adversity stresses  <cit> . previous study results have shown that the transgenic tomato expressing pr <dig> genes could increase disease resistance  <cit> , and salt stress or disease induced the expression of the pr <dig> protein in tomato  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , and other plants. in this study, the pr-5b protein precursor in the wan 82– <dig> was up-regulated, comparing 48 h with 0 h. due to the multiple disulfide bonds of protein pr-5b maintaining the equilibrium distribution in the protein structure domain, the other proteins were protected  <cit> , or the pr- <dig> proteins increased the resistance through the accumulation of proline in the plants  <cit> . the soybean stress-induced protein sam <dig> was expressed by the induction of wounding, or by the transpiration-mediated uptake of salicylic acid, methyl viologen, fungal elicitor, hydrogen peroxide, or sodium phosphate, as well as other stresses  <cit> . the expression of the stress-induced protein sam <dig> in the soybean plants was up-regulated by waterlogging stress, and the expression was further strengthened when it was inoculated with b. japonicum  <cit> . in this study, the stress-induced protein sam22-iike was all up-regulated in the gantai-2- <dig> and wan 82– <dig>  comparing 48 h with 0 h. these results indicated that stress defense system, as well as the relevant stress-induced protein sam <dig>  were involved in the defense responses.

CONCLUSIONS
this study analyzed the differentially expressed proteomic for soybean, the resistant and susceptible varietal and varieties after lamprosema indicate feeding and non-feeding using itraq technology, as well as the screening the deps which were resistant to lamprosema indicate. the results showed that  <dig> deps were identified in the gantai-2- <dig> when compared to the wan 82– <dig> at the lamprosema indicate non-feeding. a comparison was made of the lamprosema indicate feeding at 48 h and 0 h,  <dig> deps were identified in the gantai-2- <dig> and  <dig> deps were identified in the wan 82– <dig>  all of the identified deps were further divided into three types: non-lamprosema indicate-induced, both genotypes of insect-induced differential proteins, and lamprosema indicate-induced differential proteins. different resistance soybeans may use different defense strategies in response to pests, in which highly susceptible soybeans boost more of the proteins involved in the responses to pest stresses. based on the results of the differential proteomic analyses, along with the relevant previously released data, it was suggested that the soybean defended or resisted the lamprosema indicate damage by the induction of a synthesis of anti-digestive proteins which inhibit the growth and development of insects, reactive oxygen species scavenging, signaling pathways, and secondary metabolites synthesis, and so on.
