BACKGROUND
at the molecular level, naturally occurring dna sequence variation is comprised of single nucleotide polymorphisms  or indels . estimates of nucleotide diversity in mammals range from 1: <dig> base pairs  in humans  <cit> , 1: <dig> bp in chimpanzees  <cit> ,1: <dig> bp in mice  <cit> , 1: <dig> bp in cattle  <cit>  and 1: <dig> bp in pigs  <cit>  from interbreed crosses of the chinese meishan and a european white composite. insights to human diversity after genotyping three major populations  have yielded  <dig>  million snps that approximately correspond to millions of sequence variation between any two individual human genomes and  <dig>  non-synonymous amino acid changes in the proteomes  <cit> . discovery of expressed snps could arguably represent the most informative and valuable resource to study disease susceptibilities, to determine structural effects on protein sequence, and to design association studies aimed to clarify complex, polygenic phenotypes.

over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in developments of high-throughput genome-scale technologies and, collectively, high impact projects like the human genome and hapmap have paved the sequencing efforts of livestock genomes. the international swine genome sequencing consortium  has obtained funding to produce a 6x coverage of the domestic swine genome <cit> . the pig represents a priority to sequence due to its extensive history in advancing biomedical research to improve human health and agricultural importance  <cit> .

strategies for snp discovery roughly dichotomize into experimental or in silico approaches. traditionally, experimental means for uncovering snps in resource panels have predominantly relied on polymorphism screening by dna sequencing  <cit> . although 'brute force' dna genotyping by dideoxy sequencing has been the method of choice for de novo snp detection, it suffers from difficulty of dna template amplification, limitations of pcr multiplexing per reaction, and increasing equipment costs. in light of these limitations, there has been increased demand for affordable, genome-wide strategies for scaleable snp genotyping to uncover genomic variation  <cit> . contemporary, high-throughput strategies for genotyping include bead-based microfluidics, chip-based methods, bioluminescent microfluidics, and multiplex snp genotyping with maldi-tof mass spectrometry to name a few  <cit> . alternatively, in silico snp discovery pipelines rely on scanning databases for sequence variants via computational tools to examine redundancy and to score for accuracy of snp detection  <cit> . recently, chip-based methods  <cit>   such as affymetrix gene expression arrays have been used for snp discovery affymetrix short oligonucleotide arrays are fabricated with sets of eleven 25-mer probes to interrogate the expression level of a particular mrna. because of the short probe length, a snp falling in the middle of the probe sequence will result in that probe's failure to hybridize. figure  <dig> illustrates three potential hybridization scenarios within a single probe set: 1) mrna to target probes is not expressed in either breed, 2) mrna to target probes is equivalent in both breeds or, 3) intensity of a probe within a set is expressed at a high level in one breed and negligible in the other breed. although several explanations, such as alternative splicing, could account for the latter case, they can also be due to the presence of snps within the probe.

various approaches have been used to detect sfps. winzeler et al.  <cit>  provided initial proof-of-principle that single feature polymorphisms in yeast could be detected by hybridizing labeled genomic dna to short oligonucleotide microarrays. ronald et al.  <cit>  extended this approach to hybridizing crna to identify polymorphisms in yeast with a sensitivity of 45% and a false discovery rate  of 6%. borevitz et al.  <cit>  applied the sfp discovery technique to arabidopsis, an organism with an  <dig> megabase genome   <cit> , with an average false discovery rate of 35%.

rostoks et al.  <cit>  reported an average of 35–40% fdr to detect sfps using crna hybridized to affymetrix barley gene expression short oligonucleotide arrays. however, they observe more noise relative to signal when trying genomic dna hybridizations to gene expression arrays and offer the suggestion that this may be a consequence of the larger genome size of barley   <cit> .

luo et al.  <cit>  compared four different methods of sfp detection using affymetrix short oligonucleotide arrays in barley. they distinguish between genetic expression markers  which affect entire probe sets and sfps which are localized to individual probes. four methods are compared: 1) a pm-mm model, 2) a pdnn  of ronald et al.  <cit> , 3) the method of winzeler et al.  <cit>  based on genomic dna that does not distinguish between the effects of expression differences across a probe set versus in a specific probe, and 4) a k-means clustering based method. altogether, their results pointed out the methods uniformly have a high  false discovery rate  in analyses of their barley datasets.

cui et al.  <cit>  report < 20% fdr  of sfp detection using barley crna on affymetrix short oligonucleotide chips, using a method called robustified projection pursuit. this is a mathematically complex leave-one-out correlation method, where sfps are predicted on the basis that correlations omitting the feature in a probe set are likely to be higher than correlations calculated including it.

utilizing the siggene and sam procedures as described in rostoks et al  <cit> , kumar et al  <cit>  reported the identification of sfps in japonica or saponica rice varieties with a fdr ranging from 10–12%.

in general, successful methods for sfp discovery can reliably distinguish hybridization differences affecting individual probes within the context of expression differences that affect all probes in the probe set. the fdr of predicted sfp prediction appeared to correlate with genome size or complexity.

in this report, we have adapted rostoks et al.  <cit>  method of probe-by-breed analysis to facilitate snp discovery in two breeds of swine and streamlined and automated the procedure  to interface with sas/jmp® genomics.

RESULTS
mining for expressed single feature polymorphisms  by statistical analysis of expression microarrays
six porcine gene expression chips were hybridized with day  <dig> placental total rna of occidental  or chinese meishan  swine origin. a linear-mixed model was fit to the dataset to test for probe-by-breed interaction effects. this model is adapted from the rostoks et al. method with modifications in the correction for the average breed effect. in figure  <dig>  the volcano plot provides a visualization of significant changes in probe-by-breed expression values between the two swine populations. using storey's q-value procedures  <cit>  to correct for multiple testing,  <dig>  probes were identified at an estimated false discovery rate  of 5%. additionally, a threshold of a 2-fold change was imposed to examine the effect on reducing the number of false positives detected. after imposing this filter, which is represented by the vertical red lines in the volcano plot,  <dig> unique probes at a fdr of q <  <dig>  and with greater than 2-fold difference in estimated corrected probe-by-breed interaction effects were identified.

to help interpret the probe-by-breed interaction effect, individual probe plots were constructed for each probe set, represented by  <dig> unique probes per transcript, using the affymetrix porcine arrays . specifically, each of the significant probes was plotted to visually inspect probe behavior within the respective probe set versus its normalized intensity. representative plots are depicted in figures 3a and 3b. in figure 3a meishan rna for the tpt <dig> gene  did not hybridize to probe number  <dig> in all three meishan arrays ; conversely, the occidental breed did hybridize. a rational interpretation of these probe dynamics is that meishan rna could be polymorphic with respect to the array probe and is essentially behaving as a mismatch probe instead of a perfect match probe. these efforts were repeated to sample more candidates, including peg <dig> . interestingly, a non-breed specific polymorphism was revealed in one of the meishan placentas profiled for peg <dig> . in other words, because one of the probes with meishan rna behaved similar to the three occidental samples, a similar genotype could be inferred for the single meishan sample. indeed, the linear-mixed model was sensitive enough to identify a non-breed specific polymorphism as demonstrated by pyrosequencing data in the following section .

pyrosequencing data confirms the intensity plot where a g/c = s polymorphism is identified .

pyrosequencing confirms the non-breed specific nature of the polymorphism, namely a/g = r .

twenty-seven putative sfps were selected, and were pyrosequenced to confirm or disprove predicted snps at probe locations. the column labeled 'sfp' describes the character of the polymorphism discovered, such as transitions/transversions, indels , or false positives . when filtering out probes with less than 2-fold expression difference between breeds, 87% of predicted snps were true.

validation of sfp candidates by pyrosequencing
for the purposes of initial method validation, a subset of  <dig> probes were arbitrarily selected for reverse transcription-pcr using universally-tagged primers compatible with pyrosequencing technology was performed  <cit> . we opted to use pyrosequencing on cdna as this technology has high accuracy in the immediate vicinity of the sequencing primer unlike conventional dye-termination chemistry, and the target sequences were readily available as compared with paucity of swine genomic sequence. short amplicons  were designed using the exemplar sequences available from affymetrix netaffx <cit>  to amplify a region surrounding the 25-mer probe. all primers used for these assays to amplify specific probes were designed using primer <dig>  <cit>  or mprime  <cit> . probe behavior as seen in the intensity plots in figures 3a and 3b was explained by genotyping with pyrosequencing technology . a transversion mutation  in tpt <dig> was confirmed in position  <dig> of probe number  <dig> . a forward pyrosequencing assay was generated for peg <dig> to confirm the non-breed specific  snp and is illustrated in figure  <dig>  respectively. of the twenty-seven probes examined by pyrosequencing in the absence of the 2-fold cut-off,  <dig> out of  <dig> probes were confirmed as containing snps. imposition of the 2-fold expression difference criteria, improved the overall success rate of snp detection . validation of snp discovery efforts is summarized in table  <dig> 

these results also confirmed that this method tends to identify sfps that are located near the center portion of the probe sequence rather than at the ends. this is consistent with what one would predict and with the distribution observed in rostoks et al.,  <dig>  <cit> .

unbiased confirmation rates of sfp detection by random sequencing of genomic dna
in order to obtain an unbiased confirmation rate of our approach, we randomly selected sfps for sequencing from the entire pool of  <dig> candidate sfps that match a q <  <dig> , and |log <dig> fold change| >  <dig> criteria. as the complete porcine genome assembly is not yet available, these sequences were derived by comparing affymetrix porcine target sequences by blast to the latest sequence available from the porcine high throughput genomic traces from ncbi's trace archive, and represent  <dig> predicted sfps and  <dig> non-sfps. of these,  <dig> probes were confirmed to be true sfps, with an unbiased confirmation rate of 70%  of  <dig> , sensitivity of  <dig> , and specificity of  <dig> ; see table  <dig> and table 4).

this table summarizes the results of sequencing of randomly selected predicted sfps meeting the criteria of q ≤  <dig>  and a 2-fold expression difference between interacting probes. we estimate the unbiased confirmation rate from this random sample to be 70% using  <dig> arrays.

this is a confusion matrix comparing predicted versus actual sfps. sensitivity:  <dig> , specificity:  <dig> , fdr:  <dig> .

method comparison to other current approaches
the method of rostoks et al  <cit> has been successfully applied to a number of species including arabidopsis, rice, and barley; we were therefore interested to determine whether how our method performed in comparison. in order to directly compare method performance in a species with a larger number of known snps, we downloaded barley microarray and snp data  <cit>  and the respective researcher's website <cit> . both the method described herein and the method described by rostoks et al. were executed on the six-array gem subset, and performed within 1–2% of each other as measured by sensitivity and false discovery rate .

mixed model comparison using divergent tissue types
to answer the question of whether we could detect sfps in the presence of confounding effects such as different tissue types, we tested whether gene profiles obtained from two different tissue types  could be used to effectively to detect sfps. this question is particularly pertinent in the situation where one might download gene expression data online from two different breeds of animals where commonly different treatment or tissue types confound the breed effect. our test of spearman's rank correlation coefficient indicates  that there is a significant relationship between the breed-by-probe interaction p-values of a comparison between day  <dig> meishan versus occidental placenta and day  <dig> meishan versus day  <dig> occidental fibroblast.  <dig> sfps are predicted by both approaches  where  <dig> are expected by chance indicating that there is a significant overlap  =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ). taken together, these statistics suggest that sfps identified by using divergent tissue types are real.

predicted sfps and non-sfps from analysis of microarray data from same tissues are in rows; predicted sfps and non-sfps from divergent tissues are in columns.  <dig> are predicted by both analyses, where  <dig> are expected by random chance.

discussion
traditional methods of snp discovery via sanger sequencing are labor intensive. in this study, we tested a bioinformatics method of snp discovery in a species where presently no snp-chip genotyping platform exists by using the high-throughput platform of gene expression short oligonucleotide arrays to mine thousands of transcripts simultaneously. the method herein demonstrates the utility of fortuitous snp discovery exploiting the properties of probe-by-breed interaction effects after transcriptional profiling with affymetrix genechip microarrays.

in this report, we examined affymetrix probe behavior using a linear-mixed model and reasoned that probes specific to one breed that exhibit outlying intensity profiles may contain expressed single feature polymorphisms. we initially developed  <dig> pyrosequencing assays to validate the sfp detection method in swine. all sequence initially validated snps identified meishan as the discordant breed on the array due to lack of rna binding to an individual probe. a more complete description of the porcine genome should allow for localization of those sfps which fall in coding regions and give rise to non-synonymous changes. these results are also congruent to previous reports  <cit>  in which central nucleotides in the affymetrix probe were efficiently detected to contain a sfp, however flanking nucleotide positions  were marginally discernible above background .

after randomly selecting an additional set of predicted sfps for sequencing, we find that the unbiased confirmation rate , sensitivity, and specificity is comparable to those seen in barley. our adapted mixed model method highly enriches for snps within the sfp region. this mixed model approach is both sensitive and specific. using this model we do observe a trend correlating lower q-values  with the rate of sfp discovery; for example, the lower ranked 50% of samples randomly sequence contained 69% of all false positives detected .

while our approach performs similarly in comparison to other current methods, it is more computationally efficient and scaleable, generating candidate snps in approximately 20-fold less time on standard desktop computing workstations. further, our implementation has been automated for affymetrix short oligonucleotide microarrays and can generate a list of candidate sfps when provided only with an experimental design file pointing to raw .cel files. this method  is freely available as supplemental file  <dig> 

however, a limitation of this approach, as evidenced by sequencing of probes such as pak <dig> probe  <dig> rank  <dig>  is that the model is written on the assumption that there is only one polymorphic probe per probe set. the effect of the presence of multiple polymorphic probes within a single probe set is to reduce the accuracy of the correction for the average breed effect, increasing the likely false positive rate.

another drawback of this approach is that only expressed probe sets are interrogated for snp discovery. for instance, in the placenta-to-placenta comparison only  <dig>  probe sets out of  <dig>  were found to be expressed. thus, only  <dig> % of the genes present in the array could be interrogated. when two different profiles were used  this number was further decreased to  <dig>  . an alternative to increase the scope of sfp discovery is to pool different tissues. noting this potential, executing the model on existing microarray data available through ncbi's expression microarray repository, the gene expression omnibus   <cit> , may also lead to new snps.

our comparison of an analysis performed using divergent tissues  demonstrate that this method is not limited to gene expression data obtained from the same tissue or treatment and is capable of detecting interacting probes in the context of probe set wide differential expression, whether such differential expression is a result of breed or tissue specific transcriptional differences. there was a high correlation and overlap beyond that expected by chance between the sfp candidates derived from placenta-to-placenta comparison and the placenta-to-fibroblast comparisons. as such this modification broadens the application of the technology and the possibility that existing datasets, even if generated from different tissue types, can be mined for sfps. insomuch, existing microarray datasets can quickly be examined for snps that are directly associated with the samples used to generate the microarray data, thus, providing snp information that is directly relevant to the breed, strain, or and sample of interest.

in conclusion, we have adapted a linear mixed model approach to identifying expressed polymorphisms that is portable across any short oligonucleotide platform. the approach was examined by pyrosequencing of cdna, and 87% of the candidates sampled contained expressed polymorphisms. by this method, expressed transition and transversion snps as well as indels were detected. the identification of new polymorphisms should: 1) facilitate current swine genetic mapping efforts, 2) enable detailed linkage disequilibrium studies and 3) increase the resolution needed to track quantitative trait loci. as more variation in swine is identified among divergent breeds, the power to identify polygenic traits should also be vastly improved.

CONCLUSIONS
while various methods for the detection of sfps have been used in other species ranging in genome complexity, we demonstrate in this report the utility to successfully detect sfps from a mammalian species by using porcine short-oligonucleotide arrays. indeed, indels, transition and transversion single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by this approach. furthermore, the process of sfp detection has been streamlined to simplify detection on almost any short-oligonucleotide array.
