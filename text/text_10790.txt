BACKGROUND
gonadotropin-releasing hormone , the peptide responsible for the regulation of secretory activity of the pituitary gonadotropes, is found in a diffuse neuronal system situated in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamic area  <cit> . the neurons project their terminals to the median eminence where the peptide is released into the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels. the secretion of gnrh is normally pulsatile, as demonstrated by the measurement of gnrh following the direct sampling of hypothalamo-pituitary portal blood in various species such as sheep  <cit> . the frequency of this pulsatility is the main characteristic of this secretion and it encodes each part of the sexual cycle in the female  <cit> . the highest circulating concentration of gnrh is induced during the follicular phase in the female by the sequential action of the two main ovarian steroids . these act within the brain to trigger a large and sustained period of gnrh release, the gnrh surge, which stimulates the preovulatory lh surge, and subsequently ovulation.

the pulsatile nature of gnrh secretion, as well as the large amount of peptide released during the preovulatory surge, indicate that the activity of gnrh-containing neurons can be synchronized, and it has been demonstrated that the gnrh neurons of the preoptic area receive synaptic contacts from gnrh neurons  <cit> . oestradiol, which initiates the preovulatory surge of gnrh, has been shown to be involved in the synaptic plasticity demonstrated in various neuronal populations, including those in the arcuate nucleus  <cit> . moreover, in rats, an increase in the expression of the molecular markers of synaptic remodelling is observed at the time of the surge in the preoptic area where most of the gnrh neuron cell bodies are found  <cit> . in sheep, changes in the expression of the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule around the periphery of the gnrh cell bodies, associated with the seasonal changes in gnrh secretion, are indicative of potential plastic changes in this neural system linked with changes in secretory activity  <cit> . in addition, oestradiol and progesterone have been shown to modify the morphology and staining intensity of gnrh neurons within the ovine hypothalamus  <cit> , suggesting that ovarian steroids could elicit plastic changes in gnrh neurons during the oestrous cycle. however, very little work has been done regarding neuronal organization at the level of the gnrh cell bodies during the oestrous cycle in the ewe.

the aim of this work was to study the number, distribution and potential contacts present between gnrh-containing cells in intact ewes under natural conditions, focusing particularly on the neuroanatomical organization of these neurons around the preovulatory surge when a high level of oestradiol is released by the growing follicles.

RESULTS
plasma hormones
because there are some individual variations in the response to the induction of ovulation treatment , an analysis of plasma hormone concentration was carried out to confirm the allocation of animals to experimental groups according to the characteristic hormonal level previously described  <cit> . in group  <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  progesterone and lh concentrations were low, characteristic of the late follicular phase. in group  <dig>  progesterone remained low  and a surge of lh was observed for  <dig> out  <dig> animals. analysis of the lh profile concentrations showed that these animals were killed either during the ascending  or descending  part of the lh surge; for the remaining animal only a slight increase in lh secretion was observed at the end of the sampling period. in groups  <dig> and  <dig> a preovulatory surge of lh was clearly identified in all animals. these lh surges were followed by a clear increase in progesterone concentrations and the progesterone level was in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  at the end of the sampling period . global analysis of plasma hormone concentrations at the last sampling time before animals were killed revealed significant differences between groups for lh  and progesterone . as shown in figure  <dig>  the lh level was higher in group  <dig> than for any other group , and progesterone concentrations were lower in groups  <dig> and  <dig> than in groups  <dig> and  <dig> . for groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  mean levels ± sem were respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for lh and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for progesterone. however, the ewes showing no clear lh surge  or a moderate increase in progesterone concentration  were considered as slightly different from any other animal of the same group and were not used for determining the number or relative clustering of gnrh neurons.

four of the eight animals in experiment  <dig> were killed during the lh surge . the  <dig> remaining animals were killed 4– <dig> hours after the end of the lh surge and were discarded from the study.

gnrh-immunoreactive neurons
experiment 1
gnrh-containing neurons were distributed in the preoptic area  as previously described  <cit> . there was some variation in the staining intensity in the same section, but it was usually strong. the black dab/nickel ammonium sulfate precipitate was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the cell bodies and processes. the nucleus was never stained. gnrh-ir fibres were also observed around perikarya, presenting large varicosities. the distribution of gnrh cell bodies was homogenous between animals. gnrh-ir neurons were counted when the nucleus was clearly visible.

there was no difference in the total number of gnrh-ir neurons in the experimental groups  . however, the organization of the labelled neurons differed in the different experimental groups. clusters of two or more gnrh-ir neurons in which there appeared to be close contacts between neuronal cell bodies  were found in the preoptic area of all groups. however, the number of clusters and the proportion of identified neurons involved in clusters varied significantly between the experimental groups. these clusters  were more numerous in groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the moment of the preovulatory surge than in groups  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the luteal phase  .

the percentage of clusters was higher in group  <dig>  than in groups  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

experiment 2
in the second experiment, four additional animals were studied during the gnrh surge, and the data compared with those of the group  <dig> ewes in the first experiment. as shown in table  <dig>  there was no difference in the proportion of clusters of gnrh-ir neurons in the four animals sampled during the ascending phase of gnrh surge and the four sampled during the descending phase of the surge.

discussion
our observations indicate that the organization of gnrh-ir neurons was modified during the oestrous cycle, since more clusters were observed during the follicular phase. however, we did not observe any difference between the ascending and descending phases of lh release in group  <dig>  therefore, our data support the hypothesis that there are changes in communication between gnrh cell bodies prior to the initiation of the preovulatory gnrh surge.

the increase in the number of clusters was not mirrored by a parallel change in the total number of gnrh cell bodies. however, as the number of clusters was relatively small compared to the gnrh cell population , the putative increase in the number of gnrh-ir neurons could have been masked due to the large variations in the number of labelled neurons between animals. an alternative hypothesis is that the number of gnrh neurons remains constant, and that the variations in the number of clusters is linked to variations in the peptide level, which are consistent with the variations in the staining intensity observed in all animals. in this case, the level of gnrh would be higher in clustered neurons than in isolated neurons at the moment of the preovulatory surge, and therefore neuronal communication would be more efficient in clustered neurons. the percentage of clusters increased only in group  <dig>  while the difference between the number of clusters in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was not statistically significant. this special morphological organization may constitute an anatomical support for the synchronization of gnrh neuronal activity needed to induce the gnrh preovulatory surge.

clusters of gnrh-ir cell bodies have been previously described in sheep  <cit>  , rats and monkeys  <cit> . in rats they represented only 2–7% of the gnrh neuronal population  <cit> . in our study, the proportion of clusters was similar  to that observed in monkeys . however, contrary to our observation, the numbers did not change with the different hormonal conditions in the monkey  <cit> . this might be related to the distribution of gnrh cell bodies which differs between monkeys and sheep  <cit> , and it is possible that the increase of clusters observed in our experiments was related to a specific gnrh neuronal population involved in the gnrh surge secretion. indeed, fos expression at the time of the preovulatory lh surge has been shown to be expressed in a subset of gnrh neurons in rats  <cit> .

a neuronal re-organization of gnrh-containing neurons has also been previously described in anoestrous ewes where the neurons are ensheathed by glial processes which decrease the number of axo-somatic synaptic contacts  <cit> . in this latter situation, photoperiod would be the major signal to induce such a modification. another example of the relationship between synaptic afferents and gnrh secretion has been described in the monkey where the increase of gnrh activity at puberty correlates with the decrease in synaptic afferents on gnrh-containing neurons  <cit> . this morphological regulation of gnrh-containing neurons, through synaptic contacts or perikaryal apposition, involves glial processes, since in both sheep and monkeys these neurons are ensheathed by numerous glial processes  <cit> .

steroids, mainly oestradiol, are the most potent regulators in the control of gnrh neuronal activity. therefore, we may hypothesize that this "plasticity" results from an oestradiol effect, as has been shown in the monkey where oestradiol modulates the number of synaptic contacts on gnrh neurons  <cit> . in rats and monkeys, numerous studies have demonstrated that oestrogens induce synaptic plasticity in the control of gonadotropin secretion . in our study, the highest number of clusters was found during the preovulatory surge which occurred about  <dig> hours after the expected oestradiol increase, this delay being consistent with an oestradiol effect.

there was no difference in the number of labelled neurons in the experimental groups, and this observation may indicate that the level of gnrh-immunoreactivity was stable in the neurons of the preoptic area. it has previously been demonstrated in the ewe that gnrh messenger ribonucleic acid expression changes before the onset of the oestradiol-induced luteinizing hormone surge  <cit> , and that the staining intensity of gnrh-ir perikarya increases after oestradiol treatment, but that the number of labelled neurons does not change  <cit> . in addition, the variations of lh secretion induced by progesterone withdrawal are not linked to a variation in gnrh mrna  <cit> . unlike the apparent stability of the gnrh level in the perikarya, gnrh-immunoreactivity decreases in the median eminence after ovulation  <cit> . this information could indicate that variations in gnrh secretion arise from its release from the median eminence terminals without variations in peptides in the perikarya.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the morphological organization of the gnrh neurons of the preoptic area is modified during the oestrous cycle, although the overall number of gnrh-ir neurons does not change. during the preovulatory surge, the gnrh neurons are more frequently found in clusters, and the percentage of clusters is significantly higher immediately prior to the preovulatory lh surge. actual contacts between gnrh-ir neurons cannot be determined using light microscopy, but can only be demonstrated using electron microscopy. because oestradiol is the most powerful regulator of gnrh activity during the oestrous cycle, we can hypothesize that this plasticity may be induced by steroids. the role of this plasticity remains to be demonstrated, but it could increase interneuronal communication during the preovulatory surge.
