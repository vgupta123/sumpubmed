BACKGROUND
chloroplast biogenesis from proplastids requires coordinate expression of nuclear and chloroplast genes  <cit> , and is largely regulated by developmental and environmental cues such as light. approximately  <dig> proteins in chloroplasts are encoded by the nucleus  <cit> . they participate in a large number of functional processes that are required for chloroplast biogenesis. these processes include import of nuclear encoded proteins through the toc/tic complexes, protein assembly and disassembly with chaperone proteins, thylakoid formation, pigment synthesis, plastid divisions, and retrograde signaling  <cit> . in addition, a great number of proteins localized outside chloroplasts, such as photoreceptors, light-signaling transducers, and transcription factors, have been shown to be involved in chloroplast development  <cit> . on the one hand, most genes belonging to these two classes are essential for chloroplast development since suppression of their expressions leads to impaired chloroplasts. on the other hand, some light signaling pathway genes, such as constitutive photomorphogenic  <dig> , cop <dig>  cop <dig>  de-etiolated  <dig>  and phytochrome-interacting transcription factor  <dig> , function as suppressors of light-regulated gene expression and loss-of-function mutations of these genes result in ectopic chloroplast development  <cit> . in contrast, elongated hypocotyl  <dig>  that acts downstream of multiple families of photoreceptors  <cit>  has been genetically characterized as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis under a broad spectrum of light and affects chloroplast development  <cit> . overexpression of hy5-Δn <dig> has been shown to result in precocious development of chloroplasts in the hypocotyls  <cit> . determining how these genes are coordinately expressed during chloroplast development requires a genome-wide examination of gene expression during the transition from non-colored plastids into chloroplasts.

mutations in model and other plant species are important resources for functional genomics studies. analyses of some plastid development mutants identify important regulatory genes of plastid development. for example, arc <dig>  the first gene discovered to have a global effect on plastid differentiation in higher plants, was identified from an arabidopsis mutant arc <dig>  <cit> . the orange  gene that encodes a zinc-finger dnaj cysteine rich domain containing protein is isolated from the orange curd cauliflower mutant and has been proven to be responsible for the conversion of leucoplasts into chromoplasts  <cit> . the green curd cauliflower mutant is a spontaneous mutation with an abnormal pattern of chloroplast development in curds. compared with other mutants in which chloroplast development is impaired, the green curd mutant is unique in turning otherwise non-photosynthetic white tissue into green color with the ectopic development of chloroplasts in the inflorescence meristematic cells. the mutation in the green curd cauliflower could involve the gene sufficient for chloroplast development, although there is possibility that the white curd cauliflower carries a genetic mechanism for the suppression of chloroplast development, which the green curd mutation would suppress.

in the present study, we profiled gene expression in green and white curds on the genome scale using the rna-seq approach. we assembled  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp from cdna libraries of green and white curds and detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a change in expression of at least 3-fold. among them are a large number of genes associated with chloroplast development. we also observed that bohy <dig> was expressed at higher level in green curds than in white curds and that  <dig> hy5-targeted genes were expressed differentially. among these hy5-targeted genes, all the  <dig> up-regulated genes were found to be hy5-targeted genes in the light in arabidopsis, suggesting a role of bohy <dig> with the ectopic chloroplast development in the green curd cauliflower mutant.

RESULTS
cauliflower mutant with green curds
cauliflower curd is composed of inflorescence meristems that normally contain proplastids and leucoplasts and is therefore white  <cit> . in the commercially available green cauliflower mutant, chloroplasts are developed in the curd, turning the otherwise white tissue green . while the mutant plants produced green curds under normal growth conditions in greenhouse and in field, the intensity of green hue in the curd tissues was affected by light intensity. under field growth conditions, the curd tissues exposed to direct sunlight showed dark green color and those grown in shade exhibited less green hue. autofluorescence of chlorophyll in chloroplasts was clearly observed in the green curd cells under the confocal microscope .

to investigate chloroplast development in the green curd mutant, we first measured chlorophyll content in young leaf and curd tissues. higher level of total chlorophyll was detected in leaf tissue of green cauliflower plants than that of the white control. the concentration of chlorophyll in green curd cauliflower leaves was  <dig>  μg/g fresh weights , while that in the white curd leaves was  <dig>  μg/g fw. although different levels of total chlorophyll were observed between the two samples, the ratio of chlorophyll a/b for leaves in white and green mutant was similar at  <dig> : <dig> and  <dig> : <dig>  respectively. in comparison to leaf tissue, the chlorophyll level in the curd of green cauliflower was lower at  <dig>  μg/g fw. the chlorophyll a/b ratio was  <dig> : <dig>  showing that the accumulation of chlorophyll a was much greater than that of chlorophyll b in green curds . as expected, no chlorophyll accumulation was detected in the white curd tissue. the green curd cauliflower mutant serves as an excellent model system for investigating the genetic basis of chloroplast biogenesis in plants.

comparative analysis of gene expression between green and white curd cauliflower
to investigate the transcriptional control of chloroplast development, rna-seq was employed to monitor differences in gene expression between the green curd mutant and the white cauliflower. a single lane of an illumina gaii run was utilized for each library and a total of more than  <dig> million 86-bp reads from each lane were produced. since currently there is no full genome sequence available for cauliflower  and the genomics resources from other brassica species are not applicable due to the short length of rna-seq reads, we developed a novel analysis strategy for our rna-seq data as described in the methods section. a total of  <dig>  unigenes  with an average length of  <dig> bp were obtained. statistical analysis identified  <dig> unigenes that were differentially expressed between green curd mutant and white curd control. among them,  <dig> genes  were expressed at least 3-fold higher  and  <dig> genes  were expressed at least 3-fold lower in green curd than in white curd . functional categorization revealed that these genes were largely involved in cellular process , response to stress , metabolic process , response to abiotic stimulus , and biosynthetic process . yet, a large group of genes  remained unclassified .

verification of gene expression by quantitative rt-pcr
in order to verify the expression profiles obtained from the rna-seq approach, qrt-pcr was utilized to analyze the expression of  <dig> selected genes. these genes encode light signal transducers , photosystem ii component , chloroplast constituents , atp-dependent peptidase  and chlorophyll synthetase . among them were  <dig> up-regulated genes  and  <dig> down-regulated genes . the trends of the observed expression patterns of these genes from qrt-pcr were consistent with that determined by the rna-seq approach . however, there were differences at the fold level as reported in other studies  <cit> .

*qrt-pcr was carried out with two biological repeats and three technical trials.

metabolic pathway changes
to identify the metabolic pathways that were affected in the green curd mutant, a cauliflower metabolic pathway database was created based on annotation of the assembled cauliflower unigenes. the significantly affected pathways were identified by using the plant metgenmap analysis system http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/metgenmap/home.cgi <cit> . a total of  <dig> specific metabolic pathways were significantly changed in green curd mutant  . as expected, many metabolic pathways involved in chloroplast biogenesis and function were significantly altered. these included those associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis, such as chlorophyllide a biosynthesis i, chlorophyll a biosynthesis i, chlorophyll a biosynthesis ii, chlorophyll a degradation, and chlorophyll cycle, as well as with carotenoid biosynthesis . in addition, those pathways associated with photosynthesis, such as oxygenic photosynthesis, calvin cycle, and photorespiration, and with other metabolic processes that take place in chloroplasts, such as amino acid biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis, were also significantly changed .

genes involved in chloroplast formation
chlorophylls and carotenoids compose the photosynthetic pigments that play key roles in photosynthesis. many genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were found to be expressed highly in green curd in comparison with white . the upregulated genes included mg-chelatase that plays a key regulatory role in chlorophyll biosynthesis. genomes uncoupled  <dig>  and genomes uncoupled  <dig>  involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were also expressed at higher levels in green curds. these two genes are among those that produce plastid-to-nuclear retrograde signaling molecules  <cit> . the upregulation of many genes in chlorophyll biosynthesis resulted in the accumulation of chlorophyll a and b in chloroplasts. concomitantly, a number of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were also up-regulated , suggesting an increased capacity for the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. consistent with the accumulation of chlorophyll a and b in green curds, genes encoding chlorophyll binding proteins were also up-regulated . moreover, genes encoding photosystem i and photosystem ii proteins were among the up-regulated genes , indicating the development of chloroplast structures in the green curd tissue.

*that the top hits of several cauliflower unigenes correspond to one gene in arabidopsis could be due to paralogs or alternative splicing of genes in cauliflower.

in addition to the enhanced biosynthesis of photosynthetic apparatus, genes involved in a number of other chloroplast biogenesis processes were also differentially expressed in green curd mutant. translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts  <dig>  and toc <dig> are important parts of the toc/tic complexes mediating protein import from cytosol  <cit> . high levels of toc <dig>  and toc <dig>  transcripts were observed in the green curds. proteins imported into chloroplasts need to be properly assembled and folded, a process that is mediated by a group of chaperone proteins, such as hsp <dig> and cpn <dig>  and protein disulfide isomerase  <cit> . accordingly, chaperone hsp <dig>  and protein disulfide isomerase  were found to be significantly upregulated in green curds .

chlorophyllase catalyzes degradation of chlorophyll a to yield chlorophyllide and phytol  <cit> . chlorophyllase  was expressed lower in green curds than in white curds, which could account for the accumulation of chlorophyll a in green curds .

signaling genes for chloroplast biogenesis
the large number of differentially expressed genes between the green curd mutant and white curd cauliflower suggests that genes at high hierarchy in the signal transduction cascade could be involved. cop/det/fus are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that represent central repressors of photomorphogenesis including chloroplast development  <cit> . no changes were detected in the expression of cop <dig>  cop <dig>  cop <dig>  and det <dig>  cop <dig> complex acts as a suppressor of chloroplast development  <cit> . unexpectedly, we found that cop <dig>  and fusca  <dig> /cop <dig> signalosome complex subunit  <dig>  were expressed at higher levels in green curds than in white curds. such higher expression could be a result of a negative feedback as the case of spa <dig>  a partner of cop <dig>  which is frequently found to be light induced  <cit> . pifs are another group of regulators that repress photomorphogenesis. no changes were observed for the expression of pif <dig> and pif <dig> in the green vs. white curds. interestingly, the transcript of pil <dig>  was increased in the green curd mutant.

in contrast to those photomorphogenesis repressors, hy <dig> is a key regulator that promotes photomorphogenic development in all light conditions and directly regulates the light-responsive gene expression  <cit> . here, we found that bohy <dig>  and bohy5-homolog  were expressed at higher levels in green curds than white curds . a recent study on genome-wide mapping of the hy5-mediated gene networks in arabidopsis reveals that hy <dig> could potentially bind to  <dig>  genes with  <dig> and  <dig> being light and dark regulated genes, respectively  <cit> . sequence comparison with the hy5-targeted genes in arabidopsis revealed that a total of  <dig> cauliflower hy5-targeted homolog genes were differentially expressed in green curds . among them included  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes . all of the  <dig> up-regulated genes were found to be hy5-targeted genes in the light, while  <dig> down-regulated genes were hy5-targeted genes in the dark . among the  <dig> up-regulated hy5-targeted genes were  <dig> transcription factors, including arabidopsis thaliana homeobox  <dig> , phytochrome-associated protein  <dig> , phytochrome interacting factor 3-like  <dig>  and indole-3-acetic acid inducible . forty-four transcription factors including rap <dig>  , apetala <dig> , auxin response factor  <dig> , and short hypocotyl  <dig>  were down-regulated in green curds. the significant alteration of a large number of transcription factors could cause profound effects on chloroplast biogenesis and/or other processes.

discussion
large-scale transcriptome sequencing by next generation sequencing platforms such as the illumina ga sequencing system has been proven to be a powerful and efficient approach for gene expression analysis at the genome level and offers several advantages over microarray technologies  <cit> . since the rna-seq approach provides digital representation of the gene abundance and the statistics are well modeled by the poisson distribution, even a single replication has been shown to be adequate  <cit> . currently, the rna-seq approach has been widely used to investigate transcriptomes of plants and animals, especially for those having whole genome sequences  <cit> . a number of tools to map rna-seq data to reference genomes and to quantify the expression of transcripts have been developed  <cit> . however, relatively fewer reports have shown studies on using the rna-seq approach for organisms without reference genomes. in this report we employed the rna-seq approach to investigate the gene expression changes in a green curd mutant in order to elucidate the genetic basis of chloroplast biogenesis and development. rna-seq reads along with publicly available ests of cauliflower were assembled de novo using a novel assembly strategy as described in the methods section. a total of  <dig>   <dig> unigenes were obtained and  <dig> genes showed at least 3-fold changes in expression in green curd mutant. among them, a large number of genes involved in photomorphogenesis including chloroplast development were revealed, demonstrating a successful use of the rna-seq approach to profile gene expression in a species without a fully sequenced genome.

chloroplast biogenesis and development proceed with the coordinated action of many processes  <cit> . both environmental signals and plastidic/nuclear factors affect these processes. light regulation of chloroplast development has been well-documented  <cit> . the light signaling pathways are composed of phytochromes, transcription factors and numerous intermediates which control photomorphogenesis including chloroplast development. the cop/det/fus proteins are suggested to have a function in suppressing chloroplast development in non-photosynthetic tissues  <cit> . loss of function mutation of these regulators, such as cop <dig> and det <dig>  has been shown to result in ectopic chloroplast development, leading to greening in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . the fact that the transcripts of cop <dig> and det <dig> remained unchanged and a large number of light-responsive genes were altered in green curds of cauliflower suggests that other regulatory genes in the hierarchy of photomorphogenic regulation are responsible for chloroplast development in the green curd.

in the light signaling cascade, hy <dig> plays an important role in light signaling and chloroplast development. hy <dig> receives upstream signals and activates a large number of genes by directly binding to the g-box in the promoters of these genes  <cit> . here, we observed higher level of hy <dig> transcript in the green curd mutant. furthermore,  <dig> cauliflower homologs of hy5-targeted genes were differentially expressed in green curds. noticeably, among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were up-regulated genes in green curd cauliflower. the fact that all  <dig> up-regulated genes were the hy5-targeted genes in the light suggests an important role of elevated expression of bohy <dig> in mediating chloroplast development in green curd cauliflower mutant. furthermore, it is known that cop <dig> negatively controls hy <dig> activity  <cit> . although cop <dig> was expressed at the same level between green curds and white curds, we found that cip <dig> was significantly reduced in green curds . arabidopsis cip <dig> is associated with the cytoskeleton and has been hypothesized to affect partitioning of cop <dig> in the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> . it is possible that cop <dig> activity in the nucleus might be affected by low level of cip <dig>  causing ectopic chloroplast development in green curds. thus, bohy <dig> and/or the other genes at the high hierarchy in the signal transduction cascade could be responsible or work in concert to regulate chloroplast biogenesis and development in otherwise white tissue to give rise to the striking green curd mutant phenotype.

ultimately, the development of chloroplasts requires the coordinated action of a number of processes, including the biosynthesis of photosynthetic complexes, transportation of nuclear encoded proteins into chloroplasts, processing of the imported proteins, and assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus  <cit> . indeed, many genes involved in photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis along with pigment-binding proteins such as chlorophyll a/b binding proteins were discovered to be upregulated in our genome-wide profiling of green curd cauliflower. the majority of chloroplast proteins are nucleus-encoded and enter the chloroplasts via the toc/tic translocon complexes  <cit> . the increased expression of toc genes in the green curd mutant supports an enhanced activity of chloroplast-targeted protein import. the imported proteins are folded and processed to form functional proteins. molecular chaperones hsp <dig> and cpn <dig> have long been known to be involved in this process  <cit> . a recent study shows that a protein disulfide isomerase is also required for protein folding  <cit> . consistent with the increased activity of protein import, genes associated with protein folding and assembling were expressed highly in the green curd mutant for chloroplast development.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we compared gene expression on a genome-wide scale by using rna-seq in a species without a reference genome. this study identified a great number of genes associated with chloroplast development and suggested the potential role of elevated expression of bohy <dig> and/or other regulatory genes in the high hierarchy of light signaling pathways for the ectopic chloroplast development in green curd cauliflower. our results indicate that rna-seq as a powerful tool in a genomic era could accelerate the functional identification of genes and aid in dissecting the genetic basis of naturally-occurring variations in crops.
