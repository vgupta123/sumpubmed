BACKGROUND
during the past  <dig> years, protein modification by ubiquitin  and ubiquitin-like  molecules has been suggested to be an important mechanism in regulating numerous critical cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, protein degradation, epigenetic modification and intracellular localization. ubq is a  <dig> amino-acid protein that is covalently linked to lysine residues of target proteins in a multi-step process. the process of ubq conjugation involves three basic classes of enzymes. ubq-activating enzymes  activate the c terminus of ubq, resulting in the formation of an atp-dependent thio-ester that is linked to the e1's active site - cysteine residue. afterwards, ubq is transferred to the active site - cysteine residue - of an e <dig> conjugating enzyme. the third class of enzymes, the ubq-protein ligases  catalyze the final reaction , in which the ubq is attached to the lysine residue of the protein substrate . as a result of the ubiquitylation  process, the target protein can be modified by a single ubq  or several ubqs , which determines the tagging outcome  <cit> .

deconjugation of ubq- and/or ubl-modified protein substrates is essential to recycle both the substrate proteins and the ubq or ubl modifiers; thus, this process influences protein-protein interactions, signaling processes and the pool of free ubq/ubl within the cell. the deconjugation process is managed by deubiquitylating enzymes . the dubs are in a heterogeneous group of cysteine or metalloproteases  <cit> , which can cleave the scissile peptide bond between the last residue of ubq  and target proteins. since their discovery in 1990s, dubs have been emerging as key regulators in many basic cellular processes. for example, they modulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system . recently, numerous studies have shown that dubs are linked to diseases such as cancer. cydl is a tumor suppressor  <cit> ; uchl <dig> and usp <dig> are involved in parkinson's disease  <cit> ; atxn <dig> influences ataxias  <cit> .

most extensively, dubs have been studied in the human genome  <cit> . the classical dubs can be divided into five subclasses based on their ubq-protease domains. these are  ubq-specific proteases ,  otubain proteases ,  ubq c-terminal hydrolases ,  machado-joseph disease proteases  and  jamm motif proteases . nijman et al. have identified  <dig> dubs, out of which the overwhelming majority  belongs to the usp class. whereas the dubs in the jamm family are metalloproteases, the other four groups belong to the cysteine protease class. additionally, two more subclasses of dubs have been suggested based on evidence from sequence homology  <cit> . the so-called pppde group involves papain-like proteases and the wlms  are metalloproteases. both are hypothesized to play a role in removal of ubq or ubl from substrate proteins. experimentally, dubs can be identified with several approaches such as using hemagglutinin-tagged  ubq-derived probes  <cit>  or biotin-labeled ubq aldehyde probes  <cit>  for labeling. these methods had been used to identify several members of the usp, uch and otu families  <cit> . alternatively, extension of families of known or suspected representatives of dub classes is possible with the in silico collection of families of significantly similar sequences within the homology concept.

it must be noted that the understanding of the dubs' functions remains very limited despite considerable research efforts. apparently, the problems are associated with the large number of various dubs  and with their position in the subcellular gene networks where a single dub can affect several pathways via its protein substrates. one possibility to get new insight into the problem is to involve new model organisms into the analysis and to rely on their specific methodological advantages. the zebrafish  system with its morpholino  technology is superbly suited for easily studying the loss-of-function phenotype in vivo, important information necessary to elucidate the genes' function  <cit> . in this work, we use the zebrafish model to identify the mo knockdown phenotypes of potential dub genes that we have identified with in silico methods from the genome sequence. the respective experiments have been carried out for  <dig> putative dubs.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were found to be required for normal development and their morphants have exhibited complex phenotypes always with inclusion of notochord deformations. in order to narrow down the functions in development for some of the genes, we chose a neuronal marker, huc, for grouping the dubs into subgroups that provide hints for specific pathway involvement. this first loss-of-function study of dub genes in zebrafish provides a valuable resource for further dub studies in vertebrates.

RESULTS
zebrafish has more than  <dig> putative dubs encoded in its genome
dub-subclass-specific hidden markov model and blast/psi-blast searches  have been applied for identifying dubs in the proteome of zebrafish. it should be noted that the first genome-wide search has been started in february  <dig> and was regularly repeated . depending on the zebrafish proteome and the non-redundant protein database, the numbers of hits were slightly different and not all putative dub sequences were known at the planning stage of experimental work. therefore, we conclude that our current list of potential dubs in zebrafish might not be completely exhaustive; yet, it appears comprehensive at the time of writing. for the ubiquitin-specific protease  class containing a uch  domain, we determined  <dig> proteins.  <dig> zebrafish proteins resembling otu-like cysteine proteases  have an otu  domain. another three proteins have the features of machado-joseph disease proteases  with josephine domain . there are four zebrafish ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase proteins  sharing a peptidase_c <dig>  domain. the dub metalloproteases are represented by  <dig> proteins carrying a mov34/mpn/pad- <dig> family  domain . another four proteins belong to the pppde class . in total, this results in  <dig> candidate targets. in additional file  <dig>  the names and accession numbers of all  <dig> hits are shown.

the sequence domain architectures of all  <dig> dub hits are also shown in additional file  <dig>  the combination of ubq-protease domains with domains and motifs from the ubiquitylation pathway  is not a real surprise, whereas the association with nucleic-acid binding domains  and protein-binding domains  would make sense in the context of the involvement of dub proteins in the regulation of gene expression. the prpf <dig>  protein, a member of the jamm protein family, is known to be one of the largest and most highly conserved nuclear protein that occupies a central position in the catalytic core of the spliceosome  <cit> . another member of the jamm protein family, mysm <dig>  is a histone h2a deubiquitinase that regulates transcription by coordinating histone acetylation and deubiquitylation, and destabilizing the association of linker histone h <dig> with nucleosomes  <cit> . we searched the scientific literature extensively for evidence for dub functions and the summary of known dubs is shown in additional file  <dig> 

we think that both the human and zebrafish dub lists are not complete at present and revisions of the genome build or the proteome lists will lead to some correction. as a general trend, the total numbers as well as the numbers of dubs in the subclasses are quite comparable between both organisms  <cit> . for the overwhelming majority , there are also clear orthologues in fish and humans ; yet, there are also a few cases of missing equivalents in either organism or organism-specific duplications and it is not clear at present whether genome revisions will resolve these discrepancies. so far, it appears too early to draw biological conclusions out of differences in the dub lists.

 <dig> dub genes are required for zebrafish early development
at the time of starting the mo experiments, our list comprised  <dig> gene entries. for most of them, we found records in genbank and/or the ensembl genome database  suitable for straightforward mo design. it is a common and general practice to design the mos that target the atg translation sites. translation-blocking mo interferes with the protein translation process of the target gene. however, atg translation start site information was missing for  <dig> sequences and we used a workaround as described in the methods section. for these genes, we designed mos targeting splicing of exon-intron junction that is on or in the vicinity of conserved domains .

among all  <dig> mos tested,  <dig> mos  led to no detectable morphological phenotypes, while two mos  resulted in cell death in early developmental stages . the remaining  <dig> mos  gave different observable phenotypes, including abnormal development in head, brain, eyes, body axis, notochord, precardial region, yolk and tail. most of the mos did not specially affect one region but several. the notochord was always affected in the mo knockdown experiments. the results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  in this table, brief phenotypic descriptions and images of the morphants are shown.

classifying dub genes into five subgroups according to their huc expression level and pattern
as we mentioned above, most of the dub genes gave pleiotropic phenotypes. it appears difficult to classify the diverse phenotypes based on their varied morphology. therefore, we applied additional in situ staining of the neuronal huc marker. we chose huc as the primary marker because of its strong and easily recognizable staining patterns in zebrafish early development. in addition, neuronal development is always a hot topic and research-focusing point. in the screen, its distinctive distribution patterns allowed classifying  <dig> out of  <dig> dub genes into five groups  that resulted in cell death). the largest group includes  <dig> members , which shows no change in huc expression level or patterning. within this group, all the members exhibit the same neuronal pattern as the control. neurons are formed in a well-organized manner . group i is the only group that has an increased huc expression  and/or enlarged patterning and is composed of three members . overgrown hindbrain neurons were found among them . groups ii to iv are characterized by a decrease in huc expression with different patterns. group ii shows decreased huc expression without changed patterning and comprises  <dig> members . group iii exhibits decreased huc expression with slightly destructive patterning effect and has  <dig> members . they have abnormal shape of hindbrain neurons, such as curved neuron pattern and uneven cranial ganglia length. finally, group iv features a decrease of huc expression together with severely destructed patterning and it is made up of  <dig> members . all the members in this group cannot form organized neuronal patterns. besides, individual small clusters of neurons were observed. moreover, all the cranial ganglia structures were lost in this group. selected results among them are shown in figure  <dig>  since groups i and iv showed distinct huc in situ results, we next focused on these two groups for general signaling and developmental studies. the classification is summarized in additional file  <dig> 

otud7b, bap <dig> and uchl <dig>  may be involved in notch signaling
the knockdown of group i dub genes resulted in increased huc expression , indicating an increase in neurons. neurogenesis is the process of forming neurons in the early development. neuronal death during the development is a normal process happened in the normal development  <cit> . one of the well known midline cell fate signaling is the notch pathway  <cit> . inactivation of notch pathway leads to a failure of the lateral inhibition, which results in premature differentiation of neural progenitors and permits neuron mass production.

activation of notch leads to her <dig> expression  <cit> . morphants of all group i dub genes  showed neuronal hyperplasia, indicating a compromise in notch-dependent lateral inhibition during development . consistently, all their morphants showed decreased her <dig> expression in descending order of otud7b, bap <dig> and uchl <dig> , indicating that their corresponding genes may be involved in the notch signaling pathway.

otud <dig>  usp <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig>  play critical roles in dorsoventral patterning
from the huc expression, we noticed that neurons of group iv morphants are not well organized, implying that their dorsoventral patterning might be affected in the early stages. from the phenotypic studies at  <dig> hpf, the group iv morphants have dorsalized phenotypes that ranged from c <dig> to c <dig> , where c <dig> shows the strongest dorsalized phenotype  <cit> . their phenotypes became milder afterwards , which might be due to the decreasing mo blocking effect at later stages and/or negative feedback regulation on gene expression  <cit> . we collected the mo-injected embryos for in situ staining at about 50%-60% epiboly and 10-somite stages. several molecular markers were used to examine the mesoderm, ectoderm and dorsolateral regions.

three different markers of ventral territories  and two dorsal ectoderm and mesoderm markers  were used. bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  is important to the dorsoventral patterning of the mesoderm. the failure of its expression in dorsal blastomeres causes the ventralization of the embryo  <cit> . eve <dig> is a zebrafish homeobox gene similar to even-skipped in drosophila  <cit> . it is strongly expressed in the ventrolateral marginal cells. gata <dig> is a hematopoietic transcription factor gene  <cit>  that is expressed in a pattern similar to eve <dig>  it is a marker for ventral ectoderm and hematopoietic cells in ventral mesoderm. all three markers showed similar results in the group iv morphants. their transcripts in the ventral half of the marginal and the animal zone are expressed in a more restricted area than controls . for the dorsal patterning, we used chordin  and goosecoid . chordin can antagonize and repress bmp <dig> and is normally dorsally restricted  <cit> . similarly, gsc expression is also restricted to dorsal region  <cit> . expression of chd and gsc in the morphants was expanded into lateral domains . to summarize, the ventral fates were affected and restricted in a smaller area while the dorsal region was expanded during gastrula.

the shift of various marker genes  would result in phenotypic changes in the later developmental stages. in order to confirm that the dorsalized effects are maintained after gastrulation, we chose some other in situ markers for the studies at 10-somite stage: myod is used for dorsal mesoderm and somite muscle staining  <cit> ; gata <dig> is ventrally expressed in presumptive hematopoietic cells in two lateral stripes  <cit> ; and pax2a is used for marking the presumptive neural region  <cit> . from the in situ results, we found that myod and pax2a expression patterns were expanded in group iv morphants, indicating a dorsalized phenotype  <cit> . myod expression in otud <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig> morphants was weaker but wider. the number of stained somatic muscles was decreased. usp <dig> morphants showed the most severe result while usp <dig> showed a similar myod pattern to wild-type . for gata <dig> staining, widening of the two lateral stripes of presumptive hematopoietic cells was found in otud <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig> morphants. same as the results of other probes, usp <dig> morphants showed a similar gata <dig> expression pattern as wild-type . similarly, in pax2a in situ staining, usp <dig> morphants showed a similar expression pattern as wild-type. in otud <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig> morphants, distance between two otic vesicles was increased, which featured dorsalization. in addition, usp <dig> morphants also showed a decreased pax2a expression in otic vesicles . taken together, the abnormal dorsoventral patterning in morphants of otud <dig>  usp <dig>  usp <dig> and usp <dig> genes started from gastrula and continued in later developmental stages. in addition, while usp <dig> morphants always showed a more severe dorsalized pattern, usp <dig> always showed the least.

the group iv dub genes are likely involved in the bmp pathway
the bmp signaling pathway is well known for its essentiality in many developmental processes  <cit> . in zebrafish, it plays a main role in determining the ventral cell fates  <cit> . briefly, the bmp signaling pathway starts from the bmp receptors activation. the receptors are mediated by bmps and will active the smad proteins  through phosphorylation. the smad protein will then bind to a common mediator smad  to form complexes, which will finally be translocated into the nucleus and act as transcriptional regulators. mutations of ventral bmp gene will result in the dorsalization of the embryo. swirl  and snailhouse   <cit>  are two well known mutants that have mutations in bmp2b  <cit>  and bmp <dig> genes  <cit> , respectively. to gain further insights into where group iv dubs function in the bmp pathway, we preformed co-injection of group iv mos and selected mrna of bmp signaling genes. single mrna injections of bmp <dig> and smad <dig> resulted in ventralized phenotypes as previously described  <cit> . when embryos were injected with bmp <dig> mrna and group iv mo, we observed ventralized phenotypes . the results seemed to disagree with our hypothesis, since bmp <dig> is at the uppermost position in the bmp pathway. however, because dubs are enzymes, their functions might be compensated or replaced by others. thus, we preformed co-injection of bmp <dig> mrna with different combination of group iv dub mos. based on the single mo injection result, we chose the most effective usp <dig> mo as a basic component and all the mo concentrations were halved as single injection. except for the mild effect of usp15+usp <dig> double knockdown, both otud4+usp <dig> and usp5+usp <dig> mos significantly enhanced the dorsalized phenotypes in embryos co-injected with bmp <dig> mrna . for co-injection of smad <dig> mrna and group iv mos, ventralized phenotypes were found . specific injection amounts were tabulated in table  <dig>  in the table, we introduced the dorsal-ventral  value, which was calculated by the frequencies of phenotypes times a fixed value . the final dv value indicated the average result of the co-injection experiments. to summarize, the combination mos could not rescue ventralized phenotypes caused by smad <dig> mrna injection , while maintained their dorsalized phenotypes when co-injected with the bmp <dig> mrna . these data suggested that the group iv dubs act downstream of bmp <dig> and upstream of smad <dig> in dorsoventral patterning. the substrate of the particular e <dig> ligase in the bmp pathway can be deubiquitylated more efficiently by two dubs. collectively, all the group iv dub genes are involved in the bmp pathway and can affect the early dorsoventral patterning in the zebrafish. the proposed working model is depicted in figure 6a-g. we classified the phenotypes based on additional file  <dig> and further confirmed by in situ staining using different molecular markers at different stages .

two mrna  were co-injected with the group iv mos . the dorsal-ventral values were calculated as follows: frequency of phenotypes * . the highest dv value is  <dig>  which indicates 100% c <dig> phenotypes, while lowest is - <dig>  which represents 100% v <dig> phenotypes. negative values  were shown in bold.

discussion
in this paper, we describe our identification of candidate dub genes in zebrafish and the results of the "loss-of-function" screen based on the morpholino technology; thus, vastly extending the available biological information about dub gene function and creating a resource for their further functional study. to our knowledge, "loss-of-function" studies of dubs in any kinds of organism have been carried out only for very few genes due to the considerable cost associated with raising genetic knockout- and/or knockdown-modulated animals. zebrafish is a model organism that is well suited to fill this gap. it is well known for its fast life cycle and the transparency of its embryos. recently, the techniques of using mo knockdown and mrna overexpression by microinjection further advance the versatility of using zebrafish as a model system. developmental processes are always an interesting area for studying gene functions. thus, we used the zebrafish to perform the dub genes "loss-of-function" screen to understand their developmental functions.

more than  <dig> dub candidates in zebrafish were found
to begin with, we started an in silico screen aimed at identifying potential dub genes from the zebrafish genome. although both the genome and the proteome of zebrafish are subject to some changes and corrections in the future, the available sequence data is sufficient for deriving the overwhelming part of the complete genes of dub candidates. for six of the described seven classes of dubs , we found  <dig> candidates. as expected, there are no candidates for the wlm group. both in total number and in respect to the distribution among subclasses, zebrafish and human are not very different. for most  of the candidates, there are obvious orthologues in both organisms although there are occasional organism-specific duplications or missing dubs . the sequence domain architecture analysis of the dubs showed co-occurrence with domains characteristic for ubq/ubl pathways as well as for gene expression, chromatin and cytoskeletal re-structuring processes; thus, it is likely that dubs influence the respective biomolecular mechanisms .

through the in silico screen,  <dig> putative dub genes were found in zebrafish, which were classified into  <dig> families. details were summarized in the table. for the first  <dig> families , gene and protein names in human were based on nijman et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . the human homologues of the pppde family were not studied in this work. n.a. stands for "not analyzed".

dub genes play different roles in the developmental processes
out of  <dig> putative zebrafish dub genes that were subjected to a mo test,  <dig> dub morphants show pleiotropic phenotypes throughout the body. from the results, we infer that dub genes play different roles in the early zebrafish developmental processes, ranging from the dorsoventral patterning during the gastrulation to the fine-tuning of neurons and fin phenotypes. most of the dub genes appear multi-functional: they affect not only one and single developmental process. taking cyld as an example, there are published papers using the cyld knockout mice for the studies. they have different effects on spermatogenesis and osteoclastogenesis  <cit> . deubiquitylation is an important process for cells to maintain the cellular level of ubq. different cellular processes require ubiquitylation. e <dig> ligase is an enzyme that is involved in the last step of ubiquitylation. e <dig> ligases like bir repeat-containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  and mind bomb  perform different functions. bruce can regulate the apoptosis and cytokinesis  <cit> , while mib can facilitate the internalization of cell surface delta in signal-sending cell and promote notch activation in signal-receiving cells  <cit> . the number of ubq e <dig> ligases is far greater than that of dub enzymes, which implies that, as a trend, one dub enzyme could deubiquitylate the substrates of several e <dig> ligases  <cit> . this fact may explain why our dub-morphants did not show any unique and specific phenotypes. the resulting normal phenotype in some morphants may be due to the non-specific or/and low dosage of the mos. besides, we could not exclude the possibility that some other dubs could compensate the deubiquitylation process of the knockdown dub gene. thus, those  <dig> dub genes that did not give phenotypes could be regarded as the "non-essential" dub genes, while those  <dig>  dub genes caused abnormal phenotypes are critical for development.

notch signaling and the group i dub genes
in the vertebrate neuronal development, formation of excess number of neurons during the neurogenesis will decay through apoptosis to ensure the formation of correct neurons' connection and pattern  <cit> . neuronal death is a normal process happens during development  <cit> . thus, it is abnormal that there are an increased number of neurons in the developmental process. the selection of the neuronal cell death and/or survival is mainly based on various neurotrophic factors and their related signaling pathway  <cit> . notch signaling is well known for its control of cell fate and regulation of pattern formation  <cit> . notch is a transmembrane receptor that is involved in the notch signaling pathway, which was first identified in the mutant fly with "notches" in the wing  <cit> . reports had shown that notch signaling restricts neural differentiation by inhibiting the expression of proneural genes and its deficiency results in neurogenic phenotypes  <cit> . our huc in situ screen identified three group i dub genes, whose morphants exhibit an increase of neurons, indicating a premature differentiation - a possible consequence of a failure in the notch-dependent lateral inhibition. within these morphants, we further confirmed that the expression level of one of the notch signaling downstream target gene, her <dig>  was decreased. these results suggested that group i dub genes affected notch signaling directly or indirectly.

bmp signaling and the group iv dub genes
in the huc screen, there were four dub genes whose morphants had severely destructive neuronal patterning. one of the reasons to cause this could be the early defect in dorsoventral patterning. we tested different dorsal and ventral molecular markers at different time points and the results suggested that these morphants are dorsalized. one of the well known pathways involved in the dorsoventral patterning is the bmp pathway, which is required to specify the ventral cell fate  <cit> . we further underwent the co-injections experiments of mrna of bmp signaling genes and the dub mos to further determine whether these dubs are involved in the bmp pathway. when we co-injected smad <dig> mrna and group iv dub mos into embryos, the dorsalized phenotypes caused by mo injection alone was rescued, indicating that group iv dub genes are involved in the bmp pathway. surprisingly, bmp <dig> mrna injection with single group iv mo also resulted in ventralized phenotypes, which suggested that their functions might be compensated by others. thus, we decided to make a combination of mos among the group iv dubs. after double knockdown with bmp <dig> overexpression, results showed that there was a shift from v3-v <dig> phenotypes to dorsalized phenotypes. it is notable that all the experiments could not completely transform the overexpression  or knockdown  effects. this observation suggests that group iv dubs may not simply be involved in the bmp pathway, but also involved in other dorsoventral pathways such as nodal, fgf, and wnt. reports have shown that these pathways can interact with each others  <cit> . we tested different signaling genes mrna expressions by the real-time pcr. consistently, results showed that the group iv mo could affect the signaling genes expression slightly but significantly in nodal, fgf and wnt pathways. details were shown in additional file  <dig>  it is not surprising that dubs are involved and function differently in more than one pathway. many cellular processes involve ubiquitylation, which suggests that one dub may deubiquitylate more than one substrate. here, we only showed the knockdown of group iv dub genes will change the mrna expression of different signaling genes; however, we did not know exactly how they are regulated and what is the mechanistic details between group iv dub genes and them. further biochemical studies have to be conducted in order to fully understand the nature of the dubs.

CONCLUSIONS
from the in silico screen, we have identified  <dig> zebrafish dub candidate genes belonging to six families. out of the  <dig> targets that were subjected to a mo knockdown test: two were found to cause cell death and  <dig> resulted in pleiotropic developmental phenotypes; the remaining  <dig> did not show a detectable phenotype. based on the expression level and pattern changes of huc, the  <dig> cases are classified into five groups. further functional analyses of group i dub genes suggest that three dub genes  are the candidate genes to be functionally associated with the notch pathway. group iv dub genes  appear to be involved in the bmp pathway. besides, our results suggest that substrates of the e <dig> ligase in bmp pathway are deubiquitylated more efficiently by two dubs. to conclude, this paper provides a basic frame for the functional studies of dub genes and acts as a screening step for researchers to pick up their specific dub genes for follow-up studies based on the phenotypes. we understand that the screen might not be fully complete and that further research and in-depth studies are required. by releasing the genetic and functional information at this stage, the research efficiency with respect to zebrafish dub genes will be accelerated.
