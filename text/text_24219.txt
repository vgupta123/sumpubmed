BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses have a segmented genome of single-stranded negative-sense rna and belong to the family orthomyxoviridae  <cit> . they have been isolated from a variety of animals, including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals, and birds  <cit> . there are  <dig> subtypes of influenza virus a, among them the highly pathogenic avian h5n <dig> viruses which caused  <dig> confirmed infections and six deaths in hong kong in  <dig>  this virus can apparently be transmitted directly from birds to humans with no intermediate mammalian host  <cit> . infection of poultry with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can be devastating in terms of flock morbidity and mortality, economic loss and social disruption  <cit> . swayne et al.  <cit>  suggested that vaccination has the potential to reduce environmental contamination with avian influenza virus and prevent subsequent bird-to-bird transmission  <cit> . in order to prevent spread of influenza viruses, emphasis must be placed on biosecurity and flock management practices, the development of rapid diagnostics  <cit>  and vaccine production  <cit> . current influenza vaccines include a subunit vaccine  <cit> , attenuated vaccine  <cit> , dna vaccine  <cit>  and inactivated influenza vaccine  <cit> , with the latter being the most widely used on a commercial scale  <cit> .

current inactivated vaccines production requires large numbers of embryonated chicken eggs  <cit> . the major problems for production of this type of vaccine are the requirements for high-level biocontainment facilities, and in some cases, an inability to obtain high yields of virus in embryonated chicken eggs  <cit> . the yield of total viral protein from the 10-day-old chicken embryos is typically 20– <dig> mg/ <dig> eggs  <cit> . therefore large scale preparation of inactivated vaccine by this method is not feasible.

subunit vaccines, recombinant hemagglutinin and neuraminidase  <cit>  may be an attractive alternative to the inactivated vaccine, although none are currently in use as commercial vaccines. the preparation of such vaccines is obviously safer than for an inactivated vaccine and preparation of candidate subunit vaccines is simple  <cit> . moreover, subunit vaccines do not generate antibody responses to internal influenza viral proteins and thus allow distinction between vaccinated and infected birds  <cit> .

hemagglutinin protein is the receptor-binding and membrane fusion glycoprotein of influenza virus and the target for infectivity-neutralizing antibodies  <cit> . the entire hemagglutinin protein  from the h5n <dig> is composed of  <dig> amino acids, with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. the ha molecule consists of ha <dig> and ha <dig> subunits, with the ha <dig> subunit mediating initial contact with the cell membrane and ha <dig> being responsible for membrane fusion  <cit> .

the recombinant hemagglutinin protein can be produced in different ways such as expression of hemagglutinin protein in the insect cell system  <cit>  or in the recombinant baculovirus express in insect larvae  <cit> . previous baculovirus/insect cell systems have been used to express hemagglutinin genes isolated from avian influenza subtypes. however, a protein band corresponding to rha <dig> from baculovirus infected cells was not observed by sds/page of total cell protein. this could have been due to a low level of expression or alternatively incorrect glycosylation of the polypeptide in insect cells  <cit> .

the recombinant baculovirus/insect cell system can be carried out under monolayer and suspension culture. in this research the ha <dig> gene from avian influenza virus h5n <dig> encoded recombinant baculovirus was constructed and infected into insect cells under different culture methods and condition. the expression level of recombinant hemagglutinin protein in baculovirus/insect cell system was compared. guinea pigs were immunized with recombinant hemagglutinin protein in order to evaluate its immunogenicity.

RESULTS
expression of recombinant hemagglutinin in insect cells under monolayer and suspension culture conditions
a recombinant baculovirus carrying the ha <dig> gene of avian influenza a/goose/guangdong/ <dig>  was constructed and propagated in sf <dig> cells. after  <dig> generations, the virus stock was collected and the expression level of recombinant hemagglutinin protein was determined under monolayer and suspension culture conditions.

the sf <dig> cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus and cultured in  <dig> cm <dig> flasks for monolayer culture and in  <dig> ml baffled glass flasks for suspension culture. the monolayer culture was incubated in the incubator and the suspension culture was incubated in the shaking incubator for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. sds-page and immunoblot analysis of baculovirus infected sf <dig> cells from monolayer and suspension cultures revealed an obvious difference in the amount of the  <dig> kda rha <dig> protein between the different cultures, with a far yield being obtained from the suspension culture than the monolayer culture after a  <dig> h incubation . confocal imaging of the rha1-expressing sf <dig> cells using a h <dig> influenza-specific monoclonal antibody indicated that the protein was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic space .

under monolayer culture conditions, a cell density of  <dig> cells/l yielded  <dig> mg/l of hemagglutinin protein . in contrast, the suspension cell culture could be grown in reusable  <dig> ml baffled glass flasks with approximately the same cell density yielded almost  <dig> mg/l of rha <dig> . this may be due to a reduced efficiency of baculovirus entry into the sf <dig> cells and lowered cell substrate uptake in the monolayer culture, as suggested in the dee and shuler  <cit>  mathematical treatment of the diffusion-limited attachment rate in suspension and monolayer cultures.

influence of harvesting time on hemagglutinin expression in suspension culture
the sf <dig> medium contains a mixture of sugars: glucose, fructose and sucrose. glucose concentration in the culture remained above  <dig> g/l at the end of fermentation, indicating that the carbon source was not a limiting factor in this medium . suspension cultures were incubated in a shaker incubator, so optimization of harvesting time could be performed with ease in the shortest possible time. the results from the suspension culture are presented in figure 3b, illustrating the cell growth pattern after infection and the kinetics of hemagglutinin protein in the infected sf <dig> cells. there was an initial increase in the volumetric yield of hemagglutinin protein at the peak cell density, the maximum viable cell density postinfection. the observed hemagglutinin protein was  <dig> mg/l at  <dig> h post infection. at the very late phase  the yield of hemagglutinin protein in the cell decreased. the resultant secreted protein in the medium was  <dig> mg/l after  <dig> h compared with  <dig> mg/l at  <dig> h. this may be due to the lysis of some cells releasing occluded virus and some intracellular protein into the extracellular fluid. possee  <cit>  also reported that ha activity peaked at  <dig> h and decreased at  <dig> h postinfection in a similar expression system. in that study it was assumed that this decline presumably reflected cell lysis and subsequent degradation of ha. according to these results, appropriate harvesting time of baculovirus infected sf <dig> cells was an important factor in obtaining a high yield of hemagglutinin.

sugiura et al.  <cit>  obtained  <dig> – <dig> μg/larvae of purified hemagglutinin protein from the recombinant baculovirus infected in silkworm larvae. possee  <cit>  observed the hemagglutinin presented in the plasma membrane of the infected cells and ha activity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> hau/ <dig> cells was reached at peak infection of recombinant baculovirus to the s. frugiperda cells. in this study a yield of  <dig> μg/ <dig> cells was obtained from the recombinant baculovirus infected in the sf <dig> cells. this may be due to the expression of hemagglutinin protein localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells.

purification of hemagglutinin protein from the recombinant baculovirus infected sf <dig> cell
the expressed hemagglutinin protein was partially purified with the lysis buffer incorporated with 1% np- <dig>  samples were taken from each purification step and analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting . the majority of rha <dig> presented as insoluble material in the pellet as evidenced by immunoblot analysis. therefore recombinant protein is expressed as a dimeric species that is present in both insoluble and free forms in the infected sf <dig> cells. when the cell lysis experiment was repeated under various ph conditions, no additional extraction was achieved and the protein of interest remained insoluble.

immunogenicity of recombinant hemagglutinin subunits in guinea pigs
there are numerous studies of the immune response to baculovirus-expressed recombinant hemagglutinin expressed in mice  <cit> , chickens  <cit> , horses  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . doses of 15– <dig> μg of rha <dig> protein are typically required to induce the same level of immunity in humans as that achieved with a standard dose of inactivated influenza vaccine containing  <dig> μg of ha antigen  <cit> . jones et al.  <cit>  reported that higher doses of subunit vaccine were needed to induce responses comparable to those elicited by current licensed egg-derived, detergent-split influenza vaccines.

in order to study the immunogenicity of the recombinant hemagglutinin obtained from the suspension culture, guinea pigs were immunized with rha <dig> as insoluble and detergent-solubilized protein and the immune response measured by hemagglutinin inhibition, hi and virus neutralization assays. the antibody response to these proteins is shown in table  <dig>  neutralizing antibody responses to a titer of 1: <dig> and an hi titre of 1: <dig> were obtained after two vaccinations with  <dig> μg of insoluble rha <dig> . however, low hi titers and negative virus neutralization were observed in sera derived from guinea pigs immunized with the same dosage of detergent-solubilized recombinant hemagglutinin protein.

CONCLUSIONS
these results show that recombinant hemagglutinin expressed from baculovirus elicits an antibody response in guinea pigs and induces hi and neutralization titers against to the h5n <dig> avian influenza virus. therefore, this protein has good potential for use as antigen for subunit vaccine and diagnostic test. this system coupled with suspension culture could probably be easily adapted to large scale manufacturing of h <dig> antigen for the development of subunit vaccine and diagnostic test for h <dig> avian influenza virus.
