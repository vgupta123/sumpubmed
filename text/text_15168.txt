BACKGROUND
the human eto co-repressor family comprises the homologous nuclear proteins eto , mtg <dig>  and mtgr <dig>  evolutionary related to the drosophila protein nervy  <cit> . the eto homologues do not interact directly with dna but are recruited by transcription factors such as plzf, bcl <dig>  tal1/scl, gfi1and heb  <cit>  to become partners of multi-protein complexes on a gene promoter  <cit> . the eto homologues of the complexes recruit nuclear co-repressors such as n-cor,  <cit>  sin <dig>  <cit>  and smrt  <cit> , which in turn interact with histone deacetylase  compelling transcriptional repression.

importantly, eto homologue genes are commonly involved in reciprocal chromosomal translocation  characteristic of acute leukemia. for example, the eto gene becomes fused to the aml <dig>  transcription factor gene by t resulting in the biosynthesis of the aml1-eto fusion protein  <cit> . similarly, the mtg <dig> gene becomes fused to the aml <dig> gene by t resulting in the production of the aml1-mtg <dig> fusion protein  <cit> . the oncogenic fusion proteins interfere with hematopoietic gene regulation by transcriptional repression mediated by eto and mtg <dig>  respectively. co-repressors-hdac recruited by the eto portion of aml1-eto diminishes chromatin accessibility leading to transcriptional repression at aml <dig> targets  <cit> , contributing to the cellular differentiation block of the leukemic cells.

gene expression involves both trans-acting factors such as transcription factors and cis-acting elements such as promoter, enhancer and silencer regions whose accessibility to the trans-acting factors is governed by the chromatin packing. the mechanisms for transcriptional on/off switching of eto homologue genes have not been examined. eto and mtg <dig> show distinct cell-type-specific expression suggesting differences in gene regulation. eto is present in many normal tissues with the highest transcript level detected in brain and heart  <cit> . mtg <dig> is expressed for example in hematopoietic tissues, placenta and pancreas  <cit> . furthermore, the eto homologues are differently expressed during hematopoietic differentiation; eto is transiently expressed during erythropoiesis, mtg <dig> is expressed in progenitor cells and downregulated during myeloid and erythroid differentiation and mtgr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, further suggesting differences in gene regulation among the eto homologues  <cit> . results from gene targeting reveals involvement in hematopoietic development of mtg <dig>  <cit>  but not of eto  <cit>  or mtgr <dig>  <cit> . the leukemogenic fusion protein aml1-eto promotes self renewal of primary erythroid cells  <cit>  concomitant with an aml-eto-induced block of erythroid lineage commitment. this block correlates to blockade of p300/cbp coactivation complex-mediated acetylation of the erythroid regulatory transcription factor gata- <dig>  <cit> . as eto is expressed in human erythroid cells  <cit>  it may be affected by aml1-eto.

the restriction of hematopoietic expression of eto to erythroid cells  <cit>  suggests an involvement in lineage-specific gene regulation. in order to study lineage-specificity it is essential to identify structural and functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequences of the eto gene. as erythroblasts and megakaryocytes derive from a common bipotent erythroid/megakaryocyte progenitor  <cit>  studies were done in both cell types. our results show a critical role for an evolutionary conserved gata binding site in transcriptional regulation of the eto gene in cells of erythroid/megakaryocytic potential.

RESULTS
homologous non-coding eto sequence in human, mouse and rat
in order to identify the location of the proximal eto promoter, the transcription start site was identified by use of 5'-rapid amplification of cdna-ends  with mrna extracted from hel cells. the amplified cdna was cloned, sequenced and aligned to genomic dna . a complete sequence match with an upstream region of the eto transcript variant- <dig>  was observed and the transcription start site was identified at - <dig> bp . orthologous genes may be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms in conserved regions of different species  <cit> . a search for homologies within the gene upstream of the transcription start revealed a region at - <dig> to - <dig> bp that was highly conserved between human, mouse and rat . this region may carry important cis-acting regulatory elements. examination by bioinformatics analysis revealed potential ets <dig> binding sites  at - <dig> and -661; gata consensus transcription factor-binding sites at - <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig>  and a caat binding site at - <dig>  .

functional promoter upstream of the eto coding region with erythroid/megakaryocytic specificity
the factors regulating the eto gene expression have to our knowledge not been determined. therefore, we aimed at identifying major regulatory cis- acting regions and trans- acting factors regulating human eto expression in hematopoietic cells. to examine whether the sequence upstream of the transcription start of the eto gene is transcriptionally active, we cloned an - <dig> to - <dig> bp region , which was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in promoterless pgl3/basic vector, creating the plasmid pgl3/-1820- <dig>  we transfected plasmids into hematopoietic cell lines and determined luciferase activity. transcriptional activity was normalized to pgl3/sv40-promoter; promoterless pgl3/basic served as negative control. renilla vector was used as internal control for transfection efficiency. pgl3/- <dig> to - <dig> showed an approximately 3-fold increased reporter signal compared to pgl3/sv40-promoter both in erythroid  and megakaryocytic  cell lines  suggesting the presence of strong cis-regulatory elements in this particular region.

in order to identify the functionally important regulatory dna sequences, sequential deletions were made from the 5'end of the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region. the deletions were inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in promoterless pgl3/basic thus generating pgl <dig> -1326- <dig>  pgl <dig> -839- <dig>  pgl <dig> -729- <dig>  pgl <dig> -579- <dig>  and pgl <dig> -429- <dig> reporter constructs, which were transfected into erythroid hel and megakaryocytic meg- <dig> cell lines. the region between - <dig> and - <dig> bp was found to retain the transcriptional activity . the - <dig> to - <dig> and the - <dig> to - <dig> bp regions obtained by further deletions showed no transcriptional activity and may not play a significant role in eto gene expression in hel or in meg- <dig> cells. hence, the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region represents the smallest fragment generated herein that retained full transcriptional activity. thus, the results from both phylogenetic footprinting and deletional analyses reveal a region, which is likely to contain the proximal eto promoter.

the likely proximal eto promoter region  was investigated for cell specificity. the pgl <dig> -729- <dig> reporter plasmid gave a strong signal in erythroid  and megakaryocytic  cell lines and a low signal in promyelocytic hl- <dig>  myelomonocytic u- <dig> and monkey kidney cos- <dig> cells . as shown by results from real-time pcr, eto transcripts were detected in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines but not in the myeloid cell lines u- <dig> and hl- <dig> or in cos- <dig> cells . thus, even if a limited number of cell lines were investigated a robust correlation is suggested between transfected promoter activity and endogeneous eto gene activity. this result suggests cell-type-specific activation of the eto promoter. however, transfected promoter activity did not correlate directly with the eto mrna levels detected with real-time pcr. for example, meg- <dig> cells showed higher luciferase activities than hel cells but lower transcript levels . the relationship between promoter activity and mrna activity is affected by the endogeneous environment. gene regulation involves more than promoter activity. differences in repressor elements could explain the lack of correlation between promoter activity and mrna.

mutagenesis of the gata - <dig> consensus binding site represses and mutagenesis of the ets <dig> - <dig> binding site increases transactivation of the eto promoter in hel/meg- <dig> cells
as mentioned above several potential transcription factor binding sites were detected on the conserved region of the promoter . ets and gata factors play a role in erythroid differentiation and caat-binding sites are often involved in promoter regulation. therefore, we choose to determine whether the identified potential transcription factor binding sites of the conserved region contribute to transactivation of the promoter each element was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis . disruption of the gata - <dig> binding site led to a 4-fold reduction in reporter gene activity in hel/meg- <dig> cells relative to intact eto promoter. conversely, mutation of the ets <dig> - <dig> binding site  increased the luciferase signal twice. disruption of the gata - <dig>  gata - <dig>  ets <dig> - <dig>  and the caat - <dig> binding sites did not significantly affect the reporter signal. caat - <dig> was mutated because caat plays a role in promoter regulation. the results suggest that the gata - <dig> site may have a role in activation and that the ets <dig> - <dig> sites may have a role in repression of the eto gene activity in cells with erythroid/megakaryocytic potential.

gata- <dig> binds to consensus sites in the eto promoter in vitro and in vivo of hel/meg- <dig> cells but not in in vitro in g1e cells
electrophoretic mobility shift assays  and antibody supershift assays were used to examine interactions of the putative gata binding sequences  using nuclear extracts from hel or meg- <dig> cells. biotin-labeled probes, which include the various gata binding sequences were used for emsa. binding of proteins from nuclear extracts to biotinylated probe that includes the gata - <dig> sequence was indicated by gel shift . specificity of the shift was shown by lack of binding to a probe with mutations within the core consensus sequence and by inhibition of binding of biotinylated probe by excess unlabeled probe. proteins bound to the gata - <dig> probe were "super-shifted" by antibody to gata- <dig> but not by antibody to gata- <dig> indicating binding of gata- <dig> to the consensus site . gata - <dig> and - <dig> probes also showed a shift that was competed for by excess unlabeled probe indicating specific binding of nuclear extract protein . furthermore, proteins bound to the gata - <dig> and gata - <dig> elements were "super-shifted" by antibody to gata- <dig> but not by antibody to gata- <dig> . this indicates that gata- <dig> can bind to all three gata consensus sites within the conserved region of the eto promoter.

the lack of gata- <dig> binding to the - <dig> probe could result from competition from gata- <dig>  to determine whether gata- <dig> binding can be competitively inhibited by gata- <dig>  emsa was performed with nuclear extract of the g1e cell line, which is gata-1-  but gata-2+  <cit> . no primary interaction of gata- <dig> with probe that included the gata - <dig> sequence was seen . in lack of primary gata- <dig> protein-dna interaction no supershift was observed with anti-gata- <dig> . the results argue against strong binding of gata- <dig> to the - <dig> site, and therefore do not support competition from gata- <dig> for gata- <dig> binding, although this can not be entirely ruled out for the experiments with meg-01/hel cells.

an additional band besides the one labeled "shift" is present in the emsa experiments of fig.  <dig>  it is still present with the gata mutant oligo  indicating that it is non-specific, but the band is lost by supershift , suggesting that it contains gata- <dig> protein. it may represent a non-specific gata- <dig> interaction.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were used to examine in vivo binding of gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> to the putative eto gene promoter. chip assays were performed using chromatin isolated from hel or meg- <dig> cells and antibodies towards gata- <dig> or gata- <dig>  the presence of gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> in hel and meg- <dig> cells was confirmed by western blotting . the precipitated dna was examined by pcr amplification of the eto promoter fragment using gene specific oligonucleotides. by using primers specific for the evolutionary conserved region of the eto promoter, pcr products of  <dig> bp were generated from the anti-gata-2- and anti-gata-1-immunoprecipitated chromatin of meg- <dig> cells . eto promoter amplification with anti-gata- <dig> was also obtained in hel cells . chip with anti-gata- <dig> and amplification of control region with primers b was negative in both meg- <dig>  and hel cells  and amplification with control primers b was also negative with anti-gata- <dig> in both hel and meg- <dig> cells . chip controls with anti-actin or without antibody were negative , while positive pcr controls with genomic dna were positive  assay for examining interactions in vivo of consensus gata binding sequences in the 5'promoter of eto. the forward and reverse primers used to amplify the proximal promoter region from - <dig> to - <dig>  and forward and reverse primers for a downstream region from  <dig> to  <dig> as control  are shown. chip assays were carried out as described in methods using chromatin isolated from hel and meg- <dig> cells. pcr products were separated on a 2% gel and representative results are shown. top and bottom gel figures represent meg- <dig> and hel cells, respectively, except that lane  <dig> in top gel represents hel cells. lane  <dig>  100-bp ladder; lane  <dig>  actin antibody and primers a; lane  <dig>  actin antibody and primers b; lane  <dig>  no antibody and primers a; lane  <dig>  no antibody and primers b; lane  <dig>  gata- <dig> antibody and primers a; lane  <dig>  gata- <dig> antibody and primers b; lane  <dig>  genomic dna and primers a; lane  <dig>  genomic dna and primers b. gata- <dig> precipitated chromatin amplified with primers a in hel and meg- <dig> cells is shown in lane  <dig> and lane  <dig>  respectively . by using primers specific for the evolutionary conserved region of the eto promoter, a pcr product is generated both from the anti-gata- <dig> and the anti-gata- <dig> immunoprecipitated chromatin. no amplification is seen in the absence of antibody or in the presence of anti-actin. the experiment was repeated twice.

in conclusion, results from emsa/supershift assays demonstrate gata- <dig> binding in vitro to the gata - <dig> binding site supported by chip assays demonstrating binding in vivo of gata- <dig> to the putative eto promoter. these results are consistent with a function of gata- <dig> in activation of the eto promoter suggested by the results of the mutagenesis studies depicted in fig.  <dig> 

overexpression of gata- <dig> stimulates the eto promoter
gata- <dig> was transiently overexpressed in hel/meg- <dig> cells to determine the effect on co-transfected eto - <dig> to - <dig> bp promoter. the eto promoter was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by gata- <dig> . this result is consistent with a role of gata- <dig> in transactivation of the promoter.

expression of aml1-eto represses the eto gene reporter in hel/meg- <dig> cells
aml1-eto was transiently expressed in hel/meg- <dig> cells to determine the effect on the co-transfected eto - <dig> to - <dig> bp proximal promoter reporter. the eto promoter reporter was strongly repressed in a dose-dependent manner by expression of aml-eto 

discussion
the goal of this work was to feature the promoter of the eto co-repressor gene. to this end, we identified essential cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that govern eto expression within hematopoietic cells. we identified the likely proximal promoter of the eto gene whose expression within hematopoiesis seemed to be restricted to erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. examination for regulatory cis-elements of a  <dig> -kb region upstream of the transcription start site of the 5' flanking region of the eto gene revealed an initial  <dig> bp stretch to be required for maximal eto promoter reporter signal when examined in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines, which have endogeneous eto expression. conversely, the eto promoter gave no reporter signal when examined in hematopoietic cell lines with lack of endogeneous eto. phylogenetic footprinting revealed a  <dig> bp region at - <dig> to - <dig> bp  containing cis-acting elements with gata binding sites required for regulation of eto transcription.

disruption of the gata - <dig> site within the conserved region repressed transactivation whereas disruption of the ets <dig> - <dig> binding site activated the eto promoter. examination in vitro with emsa revealed binding of gata- <dig> but not of gata- <dig> to a probe that included gata - <dig> site sequences, the disruption of which abolished transactivation of the eto gene. our demonstration that emsa from the g1e cell line, which expresses gata- <dig> but lacks gata- <dig>  also did not show gata- <dig> binding to the - <dig> site, suggests that gata- <dig> does not bind to this site. however, the lack of binding of gata- <dig> to this probe is of uncertain significance and it is not possible to definitely distinguish between gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> interactions at the eto promoter. examination with chip assay revealed binding in vivo of gata- <dig> to elements within the conserved region of the eto promoter. furthermore, the promoter was stimulated by overexpression of gata- <dig>  collectively, our results demonstrate that the gata- <dig> transcription factor binds to the eto proximal promoter and is involved in eto gene expression. the gata- <dig> transcription factor is a master regulator in erythroid/megakaryocytic development  <cit> .

role of gata-1/eto in hematopoiesis
gata- <dig> belongs to a family of gata transcription factors, which bind to dna sequences within the internal gata-motif a/ta/g  <cit> . gata-1/gata- <dig> recognize similar dna-binding motifs; their expression profiles overlap for example in the erythroid lineage. gata-1-mediated eto activation is in agreement with gata- <dig> being a critical direct repressor of several target genes including gata- <dig>  <cit> , the repression of which facilitates erythroid differentiation  <cit> . in addition to the cis-acting gata elements, a putative ets <dig> binding element was also identified within the conserved region of the eto proximal promoter and shown to mediate suppressor activity. many members of the ets family for example pu. <dig>  fli <dig> and ets <dig> are known to play an important role in megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation  <cit> .

the gata family of transcription factors contains important regulators of gene expression in hematopoietic cells  <cit> . gata- <dig> is essential for the development of early and definitive erythropoiesis/thrombopoiesis  <cit> . gata- <dig> deletion results in blocked terminal erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation  <cit> . gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> are expressed reciprocally during erythropoiesis, gata- <dig> levels rise when gata- <dig> levels decrease  <cit> . what role does eto have in erythroid/megakaryocytic development and differentiation? the regulation of the eto promoter by gata- <dig> suggests a role of eto-mediated gene suppression at a phase of erythropoiesis/thrombopoiesis when gata- <dig> is up  <cit> . gata- <dig> is expressed at high levels during terminal maturation of erythroid/megakaryocytic cells  <cit> . thus, eto-mediated gene suppressor action may have a role during terminal erythroid/megakaryocytic maturation as a result of gata-1-mediated eto transactivation.

gata- <dig> has a role in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit>  by activating erythroid-specific genes  <cit>  or megakaryocyte-specific genes  <cit>  and repressing genes associated with proliferation  <cit> . the expression level of one member of the eto homologues, murine mtg <dig>  has already been shown to regulate expansion of erythroid progenitors  <cit> . likewise, eto <dig> expression in megakaryocytic cells is restricted to immature megakaryocytes and restrains their differentiation  <cit> . therefore, eto <dig> is suggested to repress inappropriate early expression of terminal megakaryocyte genes by binding to gata- <dig>  <cit> . we have observed that mtg <dig> decreases during early in vitro-induced human erythropoiesis whereas eto is increased transiently during the peak of erythropoiesis  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that eto, in contrast to mtg <dig> , has a role in repressing genes associated with self renewal and proliferation and that gata-1-activation of the eto gene might be viewed in this context.

eto homologue functions
the eto homologues are expressed in hematopoietic cells in a more or less cell-type-specific manner  <cit> . this is supported by the present work, which indicates differences in promoter regulation among the eto homologues as a possible explanation for lineage-specific expression. we find that the eto promoter is regulated by cis-acting elements contained within an evolutionary conserved region, which is lacking in the 5' flanking region of both mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> . the 5' flanking region of mtgr <dig> contains an evolutionary conserved region lacking in the two other eto homologues . the cell-type-specific hematopoietic expression of eto is much tighter than that of mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> suggesting specific eto functions. however, even though their genes are differently regulated, the eto homologues could have redundant functions if they are expressed in the same cell-type-specific context.

suppression of eto promoter by aml1-eto
the aml1-eto fusion protein, which is a gene product of the  chromosomal translocation of acute leukemia  <cit> , binds the promoter region of many genes mostly causing transcriptional suppression  <cit> . however, some genes regulated by aml1-eto do not show binding of the fusion protein to the promoter, the transactivation of which is instead affected indirectly  <cit> . the aml1-eto-mediated suppression of the eto promoter observed is unlikely to be due to a direct competition for aml1-binding sites, which are not detectable on the promoter. nevertheless, our observation may be relevant to the reported aml-eto-induced block of erythroid development  <cit> . if eto is normally involved in repressing genes associated with self renewal and proliferation, suppression of the eto gene by aml1-eto could facilitate the aml1-eto-induced block of erythroid lineage commitment.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report that the gata- <dig> transcription factor binds to the eto proximal promoter and transactivates the gene in cells of erythroid/megakaryocytic potential in a cell-type-specific manner. the same trans-acting factors that are essential in eto expression are essential in erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation.
