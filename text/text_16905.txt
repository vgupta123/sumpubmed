BACKGROUND
tumors arise from the activation of oncogenes along with the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes via somatic gene mutations or copy number variation . identification of the genetic/genomic changes that drive biological processes associated with cancer onset or progression assists in the development of therapeutics targeting the affected proteins or their downstream consequences <cit> . although extensive gene expression studies have been conducted for identifying tumor signature genes associated with poor outcome <cit> , the reproducibility of these signatures is low <cit> , posing a major challenge for identifying the causal genetic/genomic variations.

genome-wide dna copy number variation  has been increasingly used for identifying biomarkers and targets in cancer research <cit> . unfortunately, the cgh, snp genotype, and dna sequencing data typically used to detect cnv are not available for many published, large-scale studies. therefore, the development of methods to infer cnv from non-genetic data collected in these studies would serve to enhance their scientific value. strong correlations between cnv and gene expression have been observed <cit>  and initially suggested the possibility of detecting cnv directly from gene expression data. recently, the analysis of copy number alteration by expression  algorithm was developed to identify amplified or deleted chromosome regions based on gene expression data <cit> . while this approach demonstrated the utility of leveraging expression data to identify candidate cnv regions and genes whose expressions might be affected by the candidate cnv, the identified regions were often large and harbored many genes. furthermore, no objective mechanism was employed to distinguish cancer driver genes from passenger genes within a putative cnv region.

here we describe a novel wavelet based analysis of copy number alteration by expression  algorithm and combine it with bayesian networks via a key driver analysis to provide a systematic and unified approach for distinguishing cancer driver genes from passenger genes residing in inferred copy number variation sites.

methods
preprocessing data
we collected four independent breast cancer datasets, nki <cit> , wang <cit> , miller <cit> , and christos <cit> . nki samples were profiled on the agilent human  <dig> k platform comprised of  <dig>  non-control oligonucletoide probes while the other studies were carried out using the affymetrix hg133a platform, compromised of  <dig>  probe sets. each of the four microarray datasets was adjusted for estrogen and progesterone receptor  status as well as age to avoid their influence. the data were fit using a robust linear regression model , and the residuals with respect to the model fit were carried forward in all subsequence analyses as the gene expression traits. in all analyses except ace, the expression of individual gene/probe was used. in the subsequent analysis, for a gene with multiple probes we used the average expression profile to represent its expression so as to eliminate the weight effect due to multiple data points on a single location.

we also downloaded the gene expression and acgh data from the stanford university breast cancer study http://smd.stanford.edu/ <cit> . again the expression profiles of multiple probes representing the same gene were consolidated by average. the expression and acgh data were adjusted for array batch, er/pr status and age to avoid their influence.

a unified framework for expression based cnv inference and causal gene identification
we developed a framework for integrating cnv inference and gene regulatory network analysis to provide a systematic and unified approach to prioritizing genes residing in inferred cnv  regions . under this framework, we first developed a wavelet-based ace algorithm  to more efficiently and accurately detect amplified/deleted regions of the genome in cancer samples. for a given gene expression study the samples are first classified into two groups based on phenotypes such as poor versus good outcome and the two corresponding subsets of gene expression data are then taken as input for wace to infer significantly amplified or deleted cnv regions. meanwhile, a regulatory network is constructed using the bayesian network reconstruction method. finally, genes on the inferred cnv regions are input into a key driver analysis to identify hub genes in the network as potential cancer driver genes. when multiple datasets are available, all icnv regions are aligned to form recurrent cnv regions and multiple regulatory networks are combined into a single network. the recurrent cnv regions and the combined network then go through the key driver analysis to identify putative regulators.

wavelet based analysis of copy number alteration by expression 
wace algorithm is described in detail in the method of additional file  <dig> and summarized by a diagram in figure  <dig>  in brief, for a given dataset, the gene expression traits were first ordered according to their physical location on chromosomes. the expression scores  were computed for each gene with respect to the good and bad tumor outcome, and were then subjected to wavelet transform to obtain the neighboring scores . to evaluate the significance of the ns's on each individual chromosome, we empirically approximated its null distribution by applying wavelet transform to "random" es's based on randomizing the sample class labels with respect to the expression vectors, repeating this process  <dig> times. the false discovery rate for each observed ns was computed as the fraction of random ns's that were greater than  or equal to the observed value if ns >  <dig> . after evaluating the statistical significance of ns, an icnv region on a chromosome was identified if it harbored at least n consecutive positive/negative ns's at a false discovery rate <  <dig> . the n value, which varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  was proportional to the scaling level used in wavelet transform which in turn relate to the gene/probe density of the microarray platform. a high scaling level of wavelet transform increases the ns magnitude of neighbor points around a single differentiated gene, and thus makes them become statistically significant, which might in turn falsely identify a region as icnv if n is small . therefore, n value is determined by the scaling level used in wavelet transform. the higher scaling level requires large n. we have tested different n values from  <dig> to  <dig> for a given s =  <dig> in the stanford data which is comprised of both acgh and expression data. we have found that n =  <dig> provides the best overlap between acgh-and expression-based expression. similarly, n =  <dig> which corresponds to s =  <dig>  provides robust results for identifying recurrent icnv regions. finally, icnv regions in multiple datasets were aligned to determine the recurrent cnv regions. the selection of filter function and scaling level for wavelet transform, as well as the validation of the method, is discussed in detail in additional file  <dig> 

distinguishing cancer driver genes from passenger genes via reconstruction of bayesian networks
cnv regions harbor many genes but only a small portion of them are cancer causal genes. a key challenge in cancer genomics is to distinguish the cancer driver genes, which are causal for oncogenesis and whose variations confer growth advantage on cancer cells, from the passenger genes that are physically located close to the driver genes in cnv regions <cit> . several methods have been proposed to indirectly identify driver genes by intersecting genes associated with cnv regions and gene coexpression networks <cit>  or protein-protein interaction data <cit> . in our study, gene expression of two neighbor genes in an inferred cnv region  are correlated to the inferred cnv . to distinguish the potential cancer drivers, we tested whether they can causally regulate other genes instead. as shown in figure  <dig>  two candidate genes c <dig> and c <dig> are cis regulated by a common cnv. to determine whether a downstream gene g is regulated by c <dig> or/and c <dig> or neither is equivalent to select among competing models:            

where eq.  represents g independent of c <dig> and c <dig>  eq.s  -  represent g regulated by c <dig> , c <dig>  both c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively. as there are many other potential genes or factors that can affect the expression levels of gene g, the models eq.  -  are needed to condition on all other such factors. thus, the model selection process is equivalent to a bayesian network reconstruction process, which will be discussed subsequently.

bayesian network is a probabilistic representation of the gene regulatory network and has shown superior performance in integrating genetic data into gene causal networks predictive of complex phenotypes <cit> .  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially regulated genes for nki <cit> , wang <cit> , miller <cit> , and christos <cit> , respectively, were selected as input into a bayesian network reconstruction software program based on a previously described algorithm <cit> . markov chain monte carlo  simulation was then employed to identify the most plausible structures. for each seed, 15*n <dig> iterations of mcmc were run on average, where n is the number of nodes. the bayesian information criterion  scores were used as the optimization criteria. one thousand bayesian networks were reconstructed using different random seeds to start the reconstruction process. from the resulting set of  <dig> networks generated by this process, edges that appeared in greater than 30% of the networks were used to define a consensus network. the cutoff of 30% was based on a simulation study <cit> . when summarizing  <dig> constructed structures from random seeds, the histogram of the number of link occurrences among  <dig> structures shows a bimodal distribution, where 30% is the best value to separate the two modes and also has the best recall-precision tradeoff  <cit> . edges in this consensus network were removed if 1) the edge was involved in a loop, and 2) the edge was the most weakly supported of all edges making up the loop.

key driver analysis 
one primary goal of gene network analysis is to identify key regulatory components, or key drivers, of sub-networks with respect to varying biological contexts  <cit> . the kda takes as input a set of genes  and a gene causal  network n. the objective is to identify the key regulators for the gene sets with respect to the given network. candidate drivers are identified as follows. we first compute the size of the h-layer neighborhood  for each node. the range of h is from  <dig> to the diameter of the network n. specifically, for a given node g, the size of its hln is the number of its downstream nodes that are within h edges away from g. for the given network n, let μ be an array of the sizes of hlns and d be an array of the out-degrees for all the nodes. the nodes are nominated as candidate drivers if their sizes of their hln are greater than , where  is the mean of μ is and σ is the standard deviation of μ. the candidate drivers without any parent node  are nominated as global drivers while the rest are local regulators. let  be the mean of d and σ be the standard deviation of d. we also promote hub nodes as global drivers, i.e., the nodes with out-degrees above  are designated as global drivers. these criteria identify genes with number of downstream nodes or number of outlinks significantly above the average.

by definition, each driver modulates a set of genes, i.e., its downstream nodes. previous work has shown that a gene's function can be predicted by its neighbor genes in networks <cit> . moreover, a series of validation experiments show that the downstream nodes of a driver predicted by bayesian networks significantly overlap with its knockout signature <cit> .

sirna screen and cell viability assays
cell lines and sirna library
four different breast cancer cell lines, er-positive mcf <dig> and zr-75-1; and er-negative mda-mb-231and mda-mb- <dig> <cit> , were obtained from the american type culture collection, rockville, md . the sirna library targets ~ <dig>  unique human genes, with three sirnas per gene, as described previously <cit> . the library represents genes comprising kinases, membrane proteins, enzymes, components of major cellular pathways including cell cycle, transcription regulation, and signal transduction, etc.  <cit> . sirna sequences were designed with an algorithm developed to increase efficiency of the sirnas for silencing while minimizing their off-target effects  <cit> . sirnas were ordered from sigma-proligo .

sirna screen and cell viability assays
sirna screens were performed as described previously <cit>  and cells were transfected using rnaimax . cell viability assay was determined using alamarblue reagent . the fluorescence signal was corrected for background . cell growth was expressed as % viability relative to the median value of wells transfected with an sirna to luciferase.

RESULTS
as detailed in the materials and methods, the proposed unified framework for expression based cnv inference and causal gene identification is comprised of three major components, wavelet based cnv inference, causal network construction and key driver identification.

performance comparison of wace and gace
the original ace approach for identifying amplified or deleted chromosome regions used the simple gaussian transform to smooth the data and then identified the significantly abnormal regions comprised of over- or under-expressed genes via a permutation test <cit> . although this approach, named gace, was able to narrow down genes whose expression might be affected by the local cnv, it often systematically overestimated the size of the identified regions which were typically re-arrangements of small sequences. we improved gace by introducing: i) a wavelet based smoothing technique and ii) a new statistical method for assessing significance of putative cnv regions. wavelet transform is a more sophisticated filtering technique and has become a cutting-edge technology in signal and image processing because of its superior ability to accurately deconstruct and reconstruct finite, non-periodic and/or non-stationary signals <cit> . this led to a wavelet-based ace algorithm  to efficiently and accurately narrow down amplified/deleted regions of the genome in cancer samples.

to access the performance of wace, first we compared it with the existing method gace based on a previously published breast cancer study  <cit> , which consisted of gene expression and acgh data, as well as clinical data relating to tumor progression . a detailed comparison is described in additional file  <dig>  wace and gace comparison . figure s <dig> to s <dig> in additional file  <dig> illustrated the comparison results between two methods based on  the correlation coefficient between the expression- and acgh-based ns profiles, and  re-identifying cnvs based on gene expression, respectively. here we summarize the findings:  wace uncovered almost three times as many expression icnv regions overlapping with the acgh icnv regions compared to gace, and  these two sets of regions identified by wace were better correlated with each other than those identified by gace.

we also verified the cis-effect of cnv on gene expression by considering the correlation between the acgh and gene expression data of each gene in bcs <dig>  the expression of the genes located in the overlapped cnv regions was highly correlated to the corresponding acgh data. for instance, wace identified in both expression and acgh data a dna amplification region at 20q <dig>  and the gene expression and acgh ns profiles were highly correlated .

amplified regions associated with poor outcome affect cell cycle
we applied wace to the aforementioned four breast cancer microarray studies  <cit>  to infer cnv regions associated with metastasis. each dataset was independently analyzed by wace and the identified regions were then aligned to locate the recurrent regions of icnvs. to calculate the es's for each dataset, the samples were classified into two groups, the patients with metastases within  <dig> years and those with no metastasis after more than  <dig> years of follow-up.

the recurrent regions of cnv were defined as the union of the regions in which the abnormal gain/loss events were identified in at least two out of the four studies. wace found  <dig> recurrent regions covering  <dig>  genes . table  <dig> lists the recurrent regions of amplification that were consistently found by wace in all four datasets. several regions on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> identified here have been previously identified via analysis of cgh arrays applied to breast cancer tumors  <cit> . these results further confirm the accuracy of wace. we note that many of the genes in the inferred recurrent regions were oncogenes  or significantly affected the cell viability based on sirna experiments .

the important genes include known oncogenes, known tumor suppressors, and the genes that, when silenced, reduced cell viability by more than 50% based on our sirna experiments.

these regions were tested for gene enrichment using the gene ontology  categories, kegg, panther, and genego pathways. the most enriched categories include nucleosome assembly , chromatin assembly , systemic lupus erythematosus , chromatin assembly or disassembly , dna packaging  and protein-dna complex assembly . cell cycle and cholesterol biosynthetic process pathways are also enriched in the regions. all the enriched categories are shown additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

icnv regions versus acgh based regions
we further examined to what extent the recurrent cnvs inferred by gene expression reflect the recurrent cnvs based on an independent acgh data in bcs <dig>  to ensure an objective comparison, we used a popular cnv detection method, the circular binary segmentation  algorithm  on the acgh data. forty six or  <dig> % of the  <dig> cbs based acgh cnv regions in bcs <dig> significantly  overlapped with the  <dig> recurrent icnv regions detected by wace on the four gene expression studies. the overlapped regions on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have been previously identified via analysis of cgh arrays applied to breast cancer tumors  <cit> . these results demonstrate a good correspondence between the inferred cnv regions and the experimental results and thus confirm the accuracy of wace.

breast cancer gene regulatory networks
four whole-genome gene regulatory networks were first constructed by the bayesian network reconstruction method  <cit>  for the aforementioned four breast cancer studies  and then were combined by union of directed links to form a single network, which consisted of  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  directed links. previous works have shown that genes controlling many other genes in gene regulatory networks are more likely regulatory genes regulating their downstream genes <cit> . the top  <dig> genes with the most out links are arf <dig>  foxa <dig>  esr <dig>  hif1a and ube2c. arf <dig> is involved in the activation of the pi3k/akt pathways which regulate cell survival and proliferation <cit> . hif1a plays an essential role in cellular and systemic homeostatic response to hypoxia was recently found to regulate the metastasis of breast tumor to lung <cit> . foxa <dig>  esr <dig> and ube2c, are known as breast cancer prognosis biomarkers <cit> . the global features of the combined network are described in detail in additional file  <dig>  properties of breast cancer bayesian networks .

key driver analysis
we assume that the cancer driver genes have broad impacts on global gene expression while passenger genes have small impacts  <cit> . to quantify impacts of genes residing in the recurrent icnvs detected across multiple data sets, we count numbers of downstream genes that are regulated by each candidate gene locally or globally in the combined network. genes are grouped into global drivers, local drivers and passengers according to the rank of these numbers . in the key driver analysis, we focus on the genes residing in amplified regions which are regarded as a hallmark of dominant cancer driver genes <cit> .

for the genes in the recurrent regions of amplification , we identified  <dig> global drivers and  <dig> local drivers. known breast cancer susceptibility genes like tpx <dig>  aurka, tk <dig> and birc <dig> are among the top  <dig> global drivers . other known breast cancer gene target such as erbb <dig>  e2f <dig> and mtdh are in the global driver list. many of them such as aurora kinases aurka and survivin  have been targets for anticancer drugs  <cit> .

to access the robustness of predicted key drivers, we performed the kda on the networks  as combinations of any three of the four bayesian networks. over 79% of the drivers based on the 3n networks are the drivers based on the combination of all the four bns. on the other hand, the four driver sets based on the 3n networks significantly overlap with each other  and they share at least 41% of their members. therefore, the drivers uncovered are fairly robust. it is of note that the network based on all the four networks leads to many more drivers than any 3n network, indicating the great advantage of the combination of all the networks.

validation of key drivers via in vitro sirna knockdown experiments
we assessed the effect of knocking down the genes located on the amplified recurrent icnv regions by sirna on breast cancer cell viability because they were enriched for gene sets involved in cell cycle and metabolic regulation. in the previously described sirna experiments, the median of the viability of the sirna transfected cells was  <dig> %, with a standard deviation of  <dig> %, compared to the control cells transfected with an sirna to luciferase. we used a viability cutoff value of  <dig> %  to determine viability signature genes that, when silenced, significantly decrease cell viability. this resulted in the identification of a  <dig> gene signature  with a significant effect on cell viability in multiple cell lines. based on a cutoff of  <dig> × standard deviation below the median, we also derived a signature for each cell line. the four signatures from individual cell lines were then combined with v <dig> to derive a combined signature v <dig> with  <dig> genes. the genes in v <dig> and v <dig> and their viability scores are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

we assessed whether v <dig> and v <dig> signatures are significantly enriched in different gene sets including the global drivers, the local drivers, the drivers , the non-driver genes and the genes not on the recurrent regions . figure  <dig> shows the fold enrichment of each gene set for the sirna hit signatures v <dig> and v <dig>  when compared with the genes not on the recurrent icnv regions, the genes on these regions are about twice  more likely to fall into v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively. also the global drivers are most likely to be sirna hits in both v <dig> and v <dig>  followed by local drivers and non-drivers. for example, the global drivers, the local drivers and the non drivers are  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   times more likely to overlap with v <dig>  respectively than the genes on the human genome. when the genes on the recurrent icnv regions were considered as background, the global drivers were  <dig>   and  <dig>   times more likely to be in v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively, and the local drivers are less significantly enriched for the signatures.

seven drivers  are in v <dig>  the protein survivin is encoded by birc <dig>  and is well-known for its role in mitotic regulation and apoptosis, and has been developed as a target for cancer treatment  <cit> . silencing birc <dig> decreased the cellular viability by 64%. tpx <dig> is located on 20q <dig> and the cell viability dropped by 64% when it was silenced. figure  <dig> shows the subnetwork associated with the amplified recurrent icnv regions. the global and local drivers are highlighted in different sizes. the genes found in the signature v <dig> are highlighted in green.

as mentioned earlier, aurka and tpx <dig> are the top key regulators of the recurrent icnv regions. on the other hand,  <dig> of the genes on the recurrent regions overlapped with v <dig> and they include tacc <dig>  ect <dig>  cdc <dig>  notch <dig>  and pik3ca etc. here we found a molecular mechanism that linked tacc <dig> and tpx <dig> through aurka. tacc <dig>  located on an amplified region on 4p <dig>  recently emerged as an important gene in the stabilization of the mitotic spindle <cit> , and is up-regulated in several cancer cell lines including thyroid and lung cancers <cit> . cell viability was reduced by  <dig> % in the tacc <dig> sirna transfected cells. aurka resides on 20q <dig>  which was also identified as a recurrent region of amplification. it has previously been shown that tpx <dig> is one of several activators for aurka  <cit> , which in turn controls the localization of tacc <dig> to the spindles  <cit> . furthermore, tpx <dig> acts as an allosteric activator of aurora a, and together they inhibit the activity of tumor suppressor p <dig> in xenopus oocytes . the molecular interaction between the hubs located on different recurrent regions might suggest the trans-association between regions. we expect more mechanisms of this kind will be unraveled through the integration of wace and network analysis.

these experimental results demonstrate the importance of the recurrent icnv regions and the predicted key driver genes, especially global drivers in terms of significant impact on cancer cell viability, and thus validate our procedures for inferring cnv regions and identifying cancer driver genes in these inferred cnv regions.

discussion
we developed a novel wavelet based algorithm to analyze copy number alteration based on expression  and further combined this analysis with gene regulatory network analysis to identify the cancer driver genes in the chromosome regions with genomic alterations. the performance of these two methods was evaluated in additional file  <dig>  section  <dig>  in brief, wace improved on the state-of-the-art algorithm  by  reducing the over-smoothing effect of the gaussian transform and retaining the local patterns, and  eliminating the type i and ii errors induced by the non-zero centered null distribution . wace demonstrated superior performance over gace on several large scale gene expression datasets . by analyzing multiple datasets, we were able to identify recurrent icnvs that harbor many cancer-related genes, suggesting genes in these regions are worthy of further study.

integration of the recurrent regions identified by wace and the gene regulatory network analysis uncovered not only many well-known oncogenes like birc5and e2f <dig>  but also a number of novel cancer susceptibility genes such as ect <dig>  tpx <dig> and tacc <dig>  which are involved in cell cycle and ecm regulation. many of the cancer driver genes we predicted were subsequently validated via sirna experiments. table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> includes the four known and  <dig> novel breast cancer genes that are in the recurrent regions of amplification and validated by the sirna experiments across multiple breast cancer cell lines.

the importance of the identified recurrent regions of amplification  and the inferred drivers are further justified by another independent dataset from cancer gene census http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/cgp/census/. among the  <dig> known breast cancer genes compiled by cancer gene census,  <dig> are located in the arrs while  <dig> are outside the arrs, indicating that the known breast cancer driver genes are  <dig> -fold overrepresented in the arrs when compared to the genes not on these regions. among the  <dig> census genes located in the arrs, one  is the global key driver and the rest four are not the drivers, representing 25- and 2-fold enrichments, respectively, compared to randomly selected human genes.

there are multiple molecular factors contributing to poor outcome, including cell proliferation, metastasis and cell stemness etc. our assumption is that cnv significantly contributes to the disease outcome though the separation of the samples into good and bad outcome groups tends to identify metastasis genes. we don't need to pre-specify through what molecular mechanism that cnv drives disease outcome, which can be inferred in a data-driven manner. to further understand the functions of the arrs, we performed gene co-expression network analysis <cit>  on the four breast cancer datasets to identify gene modules . a module enriched for cell cycle genes  and conserved across the four corresponding networks is most predictive of survival in all the four studies, indicating cell proliferation contributes to breast cancer outcome. the arrs are highly enriched for the genes of the cell cycle module . this is further supported by the fact that the inferred key drivers include not only known breast cancer metastasis genes  but also known cancer cell cycle genes such as tpx <dig>  aurka, e2f <dig> and birc <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  these known cell cycle and metastasis genes interact with each other and with many other drivers to co-regulate the genes on the aars. furthermore, aars are enriched  for a cell cycle prognostic signature identified as metastasis markers <cit> , and two  of the thirty-three signature genes are the global key drivers . therefore, cell viability assay, used to test cell proliferation, at least partially validated our drivers. the future experiments will consider cell mobility assay to test how these inferred key drivers impact cancer cell mobility that drives metastasis.

a recent paper by akavia et al. describes a method to predict cancer driver genes by integrating cna and gene expression data <cit> . akavia et al's approach bears certain similarity as ours. both approaches first define gene groups of interest, then identify genes in the groups with cis-cnv as candidate driver genes. as we discussed in the main text, expression levels of genes in the same cnv segments are likely to be correlated so that they are assigned into the group. candidate genes  in the same co-expression module are equivalent so that we cannot rank which candidate genes are more likely to be drivers. akavia et al. used a literature based method to rank candidate genes. basically, they chose genes with known connections to cancers. however, our approach is completely data driven. we first constructed causal networks to dissect how genes in the regions of interest are regulated and related to each other and then we ranked candidate genes based on the causal networks, which is the key driver analysis described in the main text. as we mentioned in the previous discussion, majority of the drivers identified by our approach are novel and thus they won't be picked up by akavia et al's literature based approach.

jornsten et al. recently developed the epoc method to integrate cna and gene expression variations <cit> . epoc focuses on cna driving gene expression changes but disregards the indirect changes through more hubs. only genes with cna can be cancer driver genes based on the epoc model. however, our bayesian network approach focuses on how genes are causally related to each other. in our case, predicted cancer driver genes may or may not have copy number alterations. theoretically, the epoc method can also derive gene-gene relationship as jorsten et al. indicated that gene-gene relationship matrix a is the inversion of the cna-gene relationship matrix g . however, they showed that there was no prediction power using the a matrix. one reason is that in their lesso formulation for g matrix, they explicitly assumed cnas are hubs so that g- <dig> is not exactly a. we have showed that gene-gene networks based on our bayesian network approach have prediction power <cit> . thus, our method can be complimentary to the epoc method.

the impact of cnv on gene expression has been extensively studied <cit> . in our analysis, we focused on genes with cis-regulated cnvs. cnvs may result partial deletions of genes and the functional changes of the affected genes in turn cause expression changes of downstream genes. gene regulatory networks may be able to capture the effect of these cis-regulated cnvs on the trans-regulated ones. in our model, we explicitly assume cnvs cause gene expression changes. there are many mechanisms that cnv can be arisen <cit> . it is possible that expression changes of genes in dna repair processes affect cnv. more sophisticated causal models, such as dynamic bayesian network, are needed to capture these causal relationships. it is of note that there is a limitation of this transcriptome-based approach. we may miss kinases or enzymes that drive cancer progression and metastasis if these kinases' or enzymes' activity changes are mainly due to protein level changes. complementary proteomic approaches are needed to complement this approach.

CONCLUSIONS
the framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis, provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets. to our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based cnv regions in breast cancer. this integrative approach can be applied to many other large-scale gene expression studies and other novel types of cancer data such as next-generation sequencing based expression  as well as cnv data.
