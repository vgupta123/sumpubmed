BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae is a gram-negative plant pathogen that causes a spectrum of speck, spot and canker diseases on a range of plant hosts. it is divided into approximately  <dig> pathovars  that are specialized for particular host plants and are generally unable to cause disease on other species. multilocus sequence analysis  has shown that many pathovars correspond to distinct evolutionary  lineages  <cit> . a notable exception to this pattern is p. syringae pv. avellanae , where two distantly related lineages within p. syringae have converged upon a common disease phenotype on hazelnut  plantations in greece and italy. pav-associated hazelnut decline characterized by wilting of branches and trunk cankers was first observed in greece and italy in the mid 1970s, though the disease was not formally described in italy until the 1990s  <cit> . mlsa has shown that all isolates from greece form a distinct lineage related to pathogens of kiwifruit  and plum  in phylogroup  <dig>  this phylogroup also includes a large number of pathogens of herbaceous plants, including the well-studied p. syringae pv. tomato strain pto dc <dig>  in contrast, italian isolates collected during outbreaks in the 1990s cluster together in phylogroup  <dig>  along with pathogens of peas, cereals, and other plants, including the well-studied p. syringae pv. syringae strain psy b728a. more recent outbreaks of hazelnut decline in italy from 2002– <dig> were caused by pav that phylogenetically clusters with the greek isolates in phylogroup  <dig> 

in order to determine the genetic changes accompanying the evolution of hazelnut pathogenesis in these two independent lineages, we obtained draft whole genome sequences for the earliest isolate of the hazelnut decline pathogen, pav bp <dig>  a phylogroup  <dig> strain isolated from drama, greece in  <dig> and for pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig>  two strains isolated in rome, italy in the early 1990s. the latter two strains represent the extremes of genetic diversity observed in phylogroup  <dig> pav strains as determined by the mlsa analysis of wang et al. <cit> . this mlsa analysis indicates that pav ve <dig> clusters with pea pathogens  while the other strains group with pathogens of beets  and barley  although with very weak phylogenetic support.

we compared these three draft genome sequences to  <dig> other complete or draft p. syringae genome sequences representing  <dig> pathovars, including seven phylogroup  <dig> strains and six phylogroup  <dig> strains  <cit> . we performed ortholog analysis to identify instances of horizontal gene transfer between the two independent pav lineages and looked in detail at the evolutionary histories of a number of candidate pathogenicity genes, including the type iii secreted effectors  that are translocated into host cells and are important for both suppressing and eliciting defense responses. we show that the two lineages have dramatically different t3se profiles and that pav bp <dig> has undergone extensive secretome remodeling.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
 <dig> million read pairs were generated from the pav bp <dig> paired-end library, while the pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> paired-end libraries produced  <dig> million and  <dig> million read pairs respectively . the 82 bp reads for the latter two strains resulted in considerably longer contigs  than the 38 bp pav bp <dig> reads . the read depth of the contigs was very uniform for pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig>  with almost all the contigs centered around a depth of 1000x . in contrast, the majority of the pav bp <dig> contigs were centered around a depth of 300x, but there were also a large number with depth in the thousands, including some up to almost  <dig>  bp in length. these high-coverage contigs indicate that this strain harbors one or more multi-copy plasmids.

 <dig>  millions of reads.

when the contigs were scaffolded using 38– <dig> million mate-pairs, the n <dig> improved to 79 kb for pav bp <dig> and to 264–298 kb for the other strains . the total genome sizes were  <dig>  megabases  for pav bp <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb for the other two strains, consistent with the presence of extra-chromosomal plasmids in pav bp <dig>  pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> are largely colinear with the phylogroup  <dig> reference strain psy b728a, while pav bp <dig> displays substantially more rearrangement relative to pto dc <dig>  the reference strain for phylogroup  <dig> . there is a 95 kb scaffold in pav bp <dig> that is made up of high-coverage contigs and is colinear with plasmid a from pto dc <dig> over about half of its length.

ortholog analysis
the rast annotation sever predicted between  <dig> and  <dig> open reading frames  per strain  which were grouped into between  <dig> and  <dig> ortholog groups by orthomcl . there were  <dig> ortholog families shared among the three pav strains, all of which were also found in other strains. of these,  <dig> were found in all  <dig> p. syringae strains, comprising the operational p. syringae core genome. each pav strain had between  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes that lack orthologs in any other p. syringae strain. the closely related pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> strains shared  <dig> orfs that lacked orthologs in any other p. syringae strain, while there were no orfs found only in the three pav strains and no other p. syringae strain.

there were a total of  <dig> pav- specific homology groups that lacked orthologs in any other psy strain in the ortholog analysis section of the results. approximately half of these were most similar to genes from other species in the gamma-proteobacteria, while another 25% were most similar to genes from beta-proteobacterial species . over half of the orfs with gamma-proteobacterial hits matched genes from other pseudomonas species, while ~15% were to genes from the plant pathogen xanthomonas campestris. of the  <dig> pav-specific genes in pav ve <dig>   <dig> were located in two large gene clusters. one of these was a 110 kb cluster of  <dig> genes inserted at a trna locus in a region that is syntenic between pav ve <dig> and psy b728a . of these genes,  <dig> are most similar to xanthomonas campestris  <dig> genes , including a type iv secretion gene and a transposase gene located at one end of the cluster. the second cluster is 175 kb in length and consists of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> that are shared with pav ve <dig> . the central core of this region comprises a 49 kb pfgi- <dig> type integrative conjugative element , most of which is homologous to an ice from pseudomonas fluorescens swb <dig> 

recombination and phylogenetic analysis
comparisons of genealogies for each gene greater than 300 bp in length to the genome tree identified seven putatively recombinant genes where pav bp <dig> is sister to one or both of the other pav strains. however, in two cases all but one of the sequences are from pav strains, so pav bp <dig> necessarily has to be sister to other pav strains in the unrooted tree. three of the remaining five have very poor branch support. the remaining two putatively recombinant genes, a gad-like protein and a putative prophage lysozyme, cluster pav bp <dig> with one of the other pav strains, but not both. in both cases the gene trees are highly incongruent with the core genome phylogeny, so it is not possible to determine the direction of transfer. indeed, there are relatively long terminal branches leading to the pav strains, suggesting that both pav strains horizontally acquired the gene from other un-sequenced strains or that their relation may be an artifact of long-branch attraction.

when  <dig>  variable positions from  <dig> single-copy orthologous genes in each of the  <dig> genome sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis the relationships were consistent with previous mlsa studies, although with much stronger phylogenetic support . there was 100% approximate likelihood ratio test  support for every node except for two of the relationships within the pto lineage. in phylogroup  <dig>  pav bp <dig> clustered with pan  <dig> and pmo  <dig>  sister to five pto strains and pla  <dig>  in phylogroup  <dig>  pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> cluster as a sister lineage to pja,  <dig>  ptt  <dig> and ppi 1704b within a group that also included psy cit <dig>  pac  <dig> and psy b728a. these two phylogroups clustered with the phylogroup  <dig> lineage that included  <dig> of the twelve additional sequenced strains, to the exclusion of the single representatives of phylogroups  <dig> and  <dig>  the rooting of the tree is uncertain since the phylogenetic analysis did not include outgroups.

divergence times
divergence time estimates were strongly dependent on the substitution rate priors specified . using the slower rate based on the divergence of e. coli from salmonella  <dig> million years ago, we obtained age estimates for the most recent common ancestor of all p. syringae isolates ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million years, depending on the locus. phylogroup  <dig> pav strains are inferred to have diverged between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, while phylogroup  <dig> strains have ages ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million. when the substitution rate is inferred from the emergence of a clonal lineage of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  since  <dig>  <cit> , p. syringae is inferred to have diversified within the last  <dig>  to  <dig>  years. even with this rapid rate the data are not consistent with emergence of pav within the last 40 years as the minimum age within the 95% confidence interval of any of the loci is 281 years for phylogroup  <dig> pav and 2210 years for phylogroup  <dig> pav. phylogroup  <dig> pav is inferred to have emerged thousands of years before phylogroup  <dig> pav .

 <dig>  million years before present.

type iii secreted effectors
there are dramatic differences in the number of t3se homologs encoded in the genome of pav bp <dig> versus the two other strains . pav bp <dig> has homologs of  <dig> t3ses, of which five have frameshift mutations and four have transposon insertions. there are partial sequences of three additional t3ses, suggesting that they are truncated. however, they are located at the ends of scaffolds, so we are unable to confirm this. the entire sequence of a fourth t3se that is also located at the end of a scaffold, hopg <dig>  is present except for the stop codon. in contrast, pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> have homologs of only twelve and eleven t3ses respectively, and one of these, hopag <dig>  is disrupted by a frameshift in pav ve <dig> 

only six t3se homologs are common to all three pav strains, and four of these are putatively non-functional in pav bp <dig>  three of these shared t3ses  are also present in all other p. syringae strains and have genealogical histories congruent with the core genome phylogeny of the species, though hopm <dig> is truncated in many strains. these three t3ses are located in the conserved effector locus  that flanks the type iii secretion system structural genes. the pav bp <dig> hopm <dig> locus has a number of frameshift mutations, while the avre <dig> gene contains a mutation in the first codon, changing gtg to gta, which is a highly-atypical start codon that very likely severely reduces or completely disrupts translation  <cit> . the only shared and putatively functional t3se in the cel is hopaa <dig> 

the other t3se homologs that are present in all three pav strains are hopai <dig>  which is truncated in pav bp <dig>  hopx <dig>  which has a frameshift in pav bp <dig>  and hopaz <dig>  all three pav strains carry hopx <dig> in the exchangeable effector locus , which is located on the opposite side of the type iii secretion system structural genes as the cel, and which contains a variable assortment of t3ses that are flanked by conserved genes. the eel of pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> also contain avrb <dig> while the eel of pav bp <dig> contains a hopf <dig> sequence that has been disrupted by a transposase. both hopx <dig> and hopai <dig> appear to have been acquired independently by the two pav lineages after their divergence from their most recent non-pav common ancestor. the hopaz <dig> t3se is particularly interesting since it is intact and putatively functional in all three pav strains, yet appears to have been acquired independently by all three. no pav hopaz <dig> sequence shares more than 71% amino acid identity with any other pav sequence, and they each form very strongly supported distinct phylogenetic clusters with other hopaz <dig> alleles .

five other t3ses are present in the majority of p. syringae strains and have phylogenies congruent with the core genome. these include two that were lost in the common ancestor of all phylogroup  <dig> strains  and three that have recently been lost in the phylogroup  <dig> pav lineage . all other pav t3ses have been acquired by horizontal transfer since the two pav lineages diverged from each other. in the phylogroup  <dig> lineage, avrb <dig> was acquired by the common ancestor of all phylogroup  <dig> strains, hopbf <dig> was acquired by the common ancestor of phylogroup  <dig> pav, and hopba <dig> was acquired by pav ve <dig> since its divergence from pav ve <dig>  in the phylogroup  <dig> lineage, six t3ses were acquired by the common ancestor of all phylogroup  <dig> strains. nine additional t3ses  were acquired by the common ancestor of pav bp <dig>  pmp  <dig> and pan  <dig>  however, the majority of t3se gain has occurred since pav bp <dig> diverged from its common ancestor with pmp  <dig> and pan  <dig> , almost half of which are pseudogenes.

discussion
the hazelnut decline pathogen p. syringae pv. avellanae provides a striking example of convergent evolution of host-specificity. while both pav lineages are part of the p. syringae species complex, one must go back to the origin of the species complex to find their most recent common ancestor  <cit> . the fact that these two lineages began causing disease on hazelnut at roughly the same time and give rise to similar disease phenotypes makes it seem unlikely that their convergent evolution occurred entirely independently. however, we find almost no evidence of genetic exchange between these lineages, and little similarity in their respective virulence gene complements.

hazelnut decline was first described in greece caused by phylogroup  <dig> pav, yet there is strong evidence that phylogroup  <dig> pav emerged first. mlsa studies show that the phylogroup  <dig> pav clade, which is restricted to italian isolates, has over four times the genetic diversity found among the phylogroup  <dig> pav strains, which include both greek and italian isolates  <cit> . this is significant since the extent of genetic diversity is usually associated with evolutionary age . this is borne out by our molecular dating results. there is large variation in absolute divergence times depending on the substitution rate used, as rates based on fossil evidence  <cit>  are several orders of magnitude higher than rates based on emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria  <cit> , diversification within hosts  <cit> , or ancient dna  <cit> . despite these limitations, one clear point is that divergence times are three to ten times older for phylogroup  <dig> pav than for phylogroup  <dig> pav. indeed, even the most rapid substitution rates result in estimated divergence times for both lineages that predate the emergence of hazelnut decline by thousands of years.

the finding that pav has been diversifying for a long period of time without being observed in the field is surprising. in greece, pav had a particularly heavy impact on the hazelnut cultivar palaz during the late 1970s  <cit> . this cultivar was introduced from turkey in the late 1960s where there are no records of hazelnut bacterial canker. in contrast, there has been a long history of hazelnut cultivation in italy, although the palaz cultivar is not grown. italian hazelnut cultivation increased rapidly during the decades leading up to the first observed outbreak during the 1970s, going from  <dig> hectares in  <dig> to almost  <dig>  hectares by  <dig> in the province of viterbo  <cit> . much of the new cultivation in both greece and italy occurred on marginal lands with acidic soils, which are conditions that are likely to make hazelnut more susceptible to pav infection.

how can the long time since pav divergence be reconciled with the recent occurrence of hazelnut decline? microbiological surveys of in italy have found that wild hazelnut trees are often infected by phylogroup  <dig> pav <cit> , suggesting that wild trees might act as a reservoir. it is possible that phylogroup  <dig> pav are associated with wild hazelnut in greece, but similar surveys have not been carried out. taken together, these data strongly suggest that both pav lineages have been cryptically infecting hazelnut trees or wild relatives for a long time, and that the emergence of hazelnut decline in the 1970s was most probably due to changes in agricultural practice.

while there is no evidence of horizontal transfer between pav lineages, we do find a large number of genes that have been horizontally acquired from other bacteria. over  <dig> orfs from the three pav genomes lack orthologs in any other sequenced p. syringae strain. this includes over  <dig> genes that are present in one of the phylogroup  <dig> pav strains but not the other, suggesting extensive gene acquisition and loss in this lineage. over 80% of these genes have homologs in other proteobacteria. many of the strain-specific genes are organized into large genomic islands with signatures of mobile elements. two of these genomic islands are homologous to regions found in other plant-associated bacteria, although the genetic similarity is low. this suggests either that the genetic exchange occurred in the distant past or that the donor strain is only distantly related to the sequenced strains in the database. it would be interesting to sequence other hazelnut-associated bacteria such xanthomonas arbicola pv. corylina, which is responsible for hazelnut blight and pseudomonas fluorescens strains associated with the roots of hazelnut trees.

a remarkable feature of evolution of phylogroup  <dig> pav is the extremely fluid nature of their t3se repertoires. like other phylogroup  <dig> strains, the frequency of t3se acquisition is extremely high, with  <dig> t3ses acquired since it diverged from the common ancestor of the group. however, the rate of t3se loss is much higher than has been documented for any other p. syringae strain. a total of twelve pav bp <dig> t3ses are inferred to be non-functional. by comparison, the strain with the second most t3se pseudogenes is pto dc <dig> with seven  <cit> . all of the pseudogenization events in pav bp <dig> appear to have happened since it diverged from pmp  <dig> and pan  <dig>  indeed, seven of them involve t3ses that were acquired since this divergence, meaning that they were either acquired as nonfunctional genes or that they became pseudogenes after acquisition. the frequency of t3se gain and loss is much lower in the phylogroup  <dig> pav strains, with six and five gains for pav ve <dig> and pav ve <dig> respectively since they diverged from other phylogroup  <dig> strains. this is typical of the phylogroup as a whole, with three other strains that have acquired six or less t3ses and the largest number of t3se gains being twelve in ppi 1704b.

two of the pav bp <dig> t3se putative pseudogenes, avre <dig> and hopm <dig>  are notable because they are located in the cel, which is present in all p. syringae strains with canonical hrp/hrc type iii secretion systems. avre <dig> is essential for virulence in some p. syringae strains  <cit> , but is functionally redundant with hopm <dig> in pto dc <dig>  where it suppresses salicylic acid-mediated immunity  <cit> . frameshift mutations and truncations are common in hopm <dig>  including in pph 1448a  <cit> , p. syringae pv. aptata dsm  <dig>  <cit>  and pto t <dig>  <cit> . to date, all sequenced strains have had intact avre <dig> genes, except for psv  <dig>  <cit> , which has a contig break in the gene and por 1_ <dig>  which has a premature stop codon, but has an intact hopm <dig> gene  <cit> . homologs of avre are also present in a number of other plant pathogens, including erwinia amylovora and pantoea stewartii, where it is essential for virulence  <cit> . since p. syringae mutants lacking both of these t3ses have strongly impaired virulence  <cit>  it is unclear how pav bp <dig> is able to establish infection without functional copies of either gene. it is possible that hopr <dig>  <cit>  or another uncharacterized t3se compensate for the loss of avre and hopm <dig> in hazelnut. alternatively, a low level of translation might be initiated off the highly-atypical gta start codon in avre <cit>  or another in-frame start codon might be used, though this would be likely to have drastic effects on the n-terminal secretion signal and there are no other obvious candidates for ribosome binding sites.

of the twelve putatively non-functional t3ses in pav bp <dig>  four have intact homologs in phylogroup  <dig> pav. these include the two cel t3ses discussed above and two t3ses  that were independently acquired in each pav lineage since they diverged from their closest sequenced relatives. furthermore, three additional t3ses that are present in phylogroup  <dig> pav are inferred to have been lost completely in pav bp <dig> since it's divergence from pmp and pan. this striking pattern suggests that phylogroup  <dig> pav bp <dig> was under strong selective pressure to lose t3ses deployed by the other pav lineage.

the only putatively functional t3ses that are common among the three pav strains are hopaa <dig> and hopaz <dig>  hopaa <dig> is encoded in the cel and descended from the common ancestor of p. syringae. it has been shown to play a role in the suppression of innate immunity in arabidopsis  <cit> . pav bp <dig> also carries a paralogous copy  of hopaa <dig> in addition to the one in the cel. this paralogous hopaa <dig> allele is also present in the two strong arabidopsis pathogens pto dc <dig> and pma es <dig>  one of the most interesting findings is that hopaz <dig> was independently acquired in all three pav strains, which points to hopaz <dig> as a promising candidate for modulating hazelnut host specificity. unfortunately, this t3se has not been functionally characterized and has no conserved domains. hopaz <dig> alleles are present in twelve of the  <dig> p. syringae strains with sequenced genomes and dispersed among four of five phylogroups. a genealogical analysis of the hopaz <dig> family shows strong discordance from the evolutionary history of the core genome, indicating frequent horizontal transmission of this t3se family .

CONCLUSIONS
our comparative genomic analysis of three pav isolates has further confirmed convergent evolution of two independent lineages onto hazelnut, and that this convergence is not due to genetic exchange between lineages. furthermore, the divergence in t3se complements suggests that the molecular mechanisms of defense evasion are distinct in each lineage. there has been particularly extensive remodeling of its t3se repertoire in the more recently emerged lineage possibly in response to recognition by host factors that have coevolved with the t3ses deployed by the other lineage. however, both lineages have been diversifying as hazelnut pathogens since long before the initial hazelnut decline outbreak was first documented in  <dig>  this suggests that changes in agricultural practice such as the propagation of new cultivars in greece in the 1960s and 70s and the expansion of hazelnut cultivation into marginal habitats in italy may have provided suitable conditions for the epidemic emergence of previously cryptic pathogens. while this scenario is clearly conjecture, we now have a number of strong candidate loci to pursue. functional characterization of these loci in the future may reveal the key steps that these two distinct lineages took in order to subvert the hazelnut immune system.
