BACKGROUND
in the past few years, our understanding of signals required for cell-to-cell communication during plant development has increased tremendously. identification of components that mediate signaling serves as a landmark in understanding the mechanism of cell-to-cell communication in planta. several components such as phytohormones, mobile transcription factors, mobile small rnas and peptides serve this purpose  <cit> . phytohormones are lipophilic compounds which are active at very low concentrations and involved in plant growth ranging from embryogenesis to senescence  <cit> . similarly, small-secreted peptides are now emerging as growth regulators and many of them are involved in basic functions of cell growth and development. more than  <dig> genes are annotated as encoding putatively secreted peptides in the arabidopsis genome but very few are known to be involved in specific cellular signaling  <cit> . however, the precise role and mechanism proceeded by secreted peptides is yet to be established. secreted peptides have now been recognized as a new class of intracellular signal molecules, which coordinate and specify cellular functions in plants. as a new class of intracellular signal molecules, the role of these secreted peptides could be explored further.

plant cells transduce signals utilizing surface receptors binding to ligands present in the apoplast  <cit> . the s-locus receptor zmpk <dig> from maize was the first receptor kinase identified in plants  <cit> , and many receptors have been identified in plants ever since  <cit> . signaling molecules can elicit different signaling pathways, and a single receptor can also respond to more than one signal molecule  <cit> . perception of signal molecules  <cit> , and adjustability to different environmental conditions  <cit>  are interesting characteristics of these signaling cascades. plants demonstrate different growth patterns under different environmental conditions owing to asymmetric elongation or cell division . they also exhibit flexibility in the size and numbers of produced organs to ensure diversity and specificity in perception of external stimuli .

plant peptide containing sulfated tyrosine  is a tyrosine-sulfated peptide isolated from arabidopsis cell suspension medium  <cit> . it promotes cell expansion and differentiation in the elongation zone of roots at nanomolar concentration. this 18-amino acid glycopeptide is derived from a 75-amino acid precursor polypeptide containing an n-terminal signal peptide  <cit> . psy <dig> is believed to bind the extracellular domain of leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase , which is named as a receptor of psy <dig> . psy <dig> and its receptor psy1r are expressed throughout the whole plant with higher expression in shoot apical meristem and elongation zone of roots. psy <dig> is known to be highly up-regulated after wounding  <cit> . exogenous application of purified psy <dig> peptide to suspension cell culture induces cellular proliferation, expansion and elongation while overexpression of arabidopsis psy <dig> causes longer roots with larger cotyledon as compared to wild type  <cit> . recently, receptor psy1r and peptide psy <dig> were found to be involved in plant defense  <cit> . the psy1r might integrate growth promotion and defense signals leading to modulation of cellular plasticity, and may allow the cells to adjust towards environmental changes.

in order to understand the role of psy <dig> and its receptor psy1r, a full genome microarray study was performed. identification of genes responding to psy <dig> is a bottleneck in explaining the specific signaling phenomenon. this is the first comprehensive study to elucidate components of the psy1-based signaling cascade using full genome microarray in response to exogenously applied psy <dig>  we found that several genes, involved in plethora of physiological functions, are differentially expressed after psy <dig> exposure. our study indicates that two psy <dig> responses exist. the promoter analysis leads to identification of a light regulatory motif in differentially expressed genes of psy1r mutant plants.

RESULTS
genome wide analysis of two plant lines after psy <dig> treatment and validation of microarray data
in order to understand the psy1-based signaling cascade, we decided to identify genes affected by psy <dig>  for this purpose, transcriptome analyses were performed on two plant lines after psy <dig> treatment. the two plant lines  were germinated and grown hydroponically for one week under sterile conditions. then both lines were treated with psy <dig> peptide  for 4 hrs before mrna isolation for microarray analysis . three independent biological samples were prepared and an arabidopsis gene expression microarray  of one color was used.figure  <dig> 
schematic presentation of experimental set-up. two plant lines were grown hydroponically for one week and following treated with  <dig> nm psy <dig> for 4 hr before rna extraction. three independent biological samples were prepared.



in the transcriptome analysis, a number of genes were identified using the criteria; p <  <dig>  and fold change > <dig> or < - <dig>  gene expression analysis after peptide treatment of wild type plants revealed significant differential expression of  <dig> genes. among them  <dig> genes were up-regulated while  <dig> genes were down-regulated . mutation of the receptor resulted in  <dig> genes with altered expression levels as compared to wild type . among them,  <dig> genes were down-regulated while  <dig> genes were up-regulated in receptor knockout plants indicating the lack of a downstream response to the treatment . interestingly, the number of differentially expressed genes  was higher when comparison was made between psy1-treated wild type and psy1-treated receptor knockout lines  . examination of gene ontology  terms in both plant lines after psy <dig> treatment demonstrated the specific contribution of different classes of biological functions in each category . individual genes of each category were assigned to six different classes of relevant putative biological functions that were derived automatically using amigo. interestingly all three comparisons showed the overall same distribution. maximum numbers of differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular and biosynthetic processes while the major part of the genes were also involved in regulation and metabolism . the category “reproduction” was not found after psy <dig> treatment in wild type while this category was present in receptor knockout plants . additionally, the number of differentially expressed genes attributed as kinases or phosphatases were higher in receptor mutant plants as compared to psy <dig> responsive genes .figure  <dig>

the expression levels found in the microarray study were confirmed by quantitative real time rt-pcr for selected genes . the genes were selected in view of their role in cell elongation with range of differential expression to validate microarray data. the selected genes included a novel protein wave-dampened  <dig>  involved in cell expansion and root waving. another gene that encodes a phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase  also up-regulated after psy <dig> treatment was selected, and so was ralf <dig>  which is not characterized but belongs to another family of signaling peptide. other tested proteins included aml <dig> , which is involved in embryo development, crl , which is implicated in pattern of cell division and mpk <dig> , which influences differentiation and plastid division. the specific primers used for each gene are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the qrt-pcr results generally agreed with the microarray data, however quantitative differences in expression levels were observed. in our experiments, the microarray was found to be more sensitive than the qrt-pcr data . importantly, the qrt-pcr confirmed the presence of two groups of psy <dig> responsive genes, one group dependent on the presence of psy1r, the other group independent of psy1r.figure  <dig>

identification of enriched go terms of differentially expressed genes in both plant lines
in order to identify enriched go terms, an analysis of over-representing go categories using agrigo  was conducted  <cit> . over-representing go terms were divided into biological processes , cellular component  and molecular function . according to bp,  <dig> categories were significantly enriched in wild type after psy <dig> treatment. to make it more simple and visual, the over-representing go categories were drawn manually. these over-representing go categories include response to hormone stimulus, regulation of biosynthetic processes and regulation of transcription . when looking at cellular components , four significant enriched categories were observed with majority of genes localized to cell wall . cell wall loosening requires lowering of the apoplastic ph as well as structural changes such as breakage of load-bearing bonds through enzymes  <cit> . according to molecular functions, two over-represented go categories were found namely transcription factor activity and carboxylesterase activity . esterases remove methyl groups from polysaccharides and can thereby cause breakage of polysaccharides  <cit> . this is suggested to be one of the mechanisms required for cell elongation , and would support a mechanism of psy1-induced cell growth.figure  <dig>

a functional enrichment study of differentially expressed genes in the psy1r mutant plants revealed that  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched. the most prominent enriched functions in bp were response to stimuli, regulation of transcription, metal ion transport, flower development and response to abscisic acid stimulus  . response to stimuli and regulation of transcription are believed to happen through perception of psy <dig> peptide by the receptor psy1r as extracellular signals mediate specific cellular functions by triggering a signaling cascade that result in modulation of transcription factor activity  <cit> . other significant enriched terms are metal ion transport genes  mainly involved in copper and iron transport. both iron and copper transporters contribute to root elongation of arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . the metal ion transport go term’ is also found in the psy1r mutant plants. the go term “response to abscisic acid stimulus” is enriched in psy1r mutant plants. abscisic acid is involved in various processes including biotic and abiotic stress responses. a number of the differentially expressed genes  have previously been found to exhibit a negative regulation on abscisic acid response during growth  <cit> . recently mosher et al.  found an involvement of psy1r in plant defense  <cit> . this effect may be caused by changes in aba levels, since aba has profound roles in modulating diverse plant-pathogen interactions mediated by cross talk with the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signal pathways  <cit> . genes found in the psy1r mutant plants involved in go term “flower development”  are mainly involved in promotion of transition of vegetative meristem to reproductive development, carpel formation and ovule development . according to cellular component , over-representing go term found in the psy1r mutant plant is nucleus . this is not surprising due to the increase in transcription factor activity occurring in the nucleus. according to molecular functions ,  <dig> categories were significantly enriched. the most significant enriched functions were ion binding followed by transcription factor activity, kinase activity and atp binding . these molecular function go terms make sense in psy1r mutant plants due to psy1r role in these functions and being a receptor of peptide psy <dig> figure  <dig>

in the psy1-treated psy1r mutant plants,  <dig> go terms were found according to biological component  and these numbers were higher in the psy1-treated psy1r mutant plants than in untreated psy1r mutant plants. go terms lacking in the untreated psy1r mutant is “response to auxin stimulus” and “cellular amino acid metabolic processes”. no differences were observed according to cellular component. when comparing molecular function go terms of psy1-treated and untreated psy1r plants, most prominent difference is the carboxylesterase activity observed in peptide-treated plants. this enzyme activity is completely absent in the untreated mutant plant line. these differences encouraged a more comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed genes in the two plant lines.

receptor dependent and independent response to peptide psy1
in order to compare the affected genes venn diagrams were drawn. the diagrams provide a comparison of differentially expressed genes in all three treatments . the diagrams illustrate that some differentially expressed genes are common among treatments and some solely expressed in one treatment but absent in other treatments. additionally a simplified comparison is made between peptide-treated wild type and peptide-treated psy1r mutant plants . it revealed that psy <dig> does trigger a response even in the absence of psy1r, suggesting the existence of two parallel responses, named as a) psy1r-independent response and b) psy1r-dependent response. the genes that responded to psy <dig> in both plant lines belongs to the psy1r-independent response, while the psy1r dependent response consists of genes that are differentially expressed as response to psy <dig> only in the presence of the receptor psy1r. the psy1r-receptor independent response includes  <dig> genes expressed in both plant lines after psy <dig> treatment . there could be two possible reasons for transcripts expression in psy1r-independent response. the first one might be due to absence of natural receptor psy1r, psy <dig> binds to a low affinity receptor that capable of activating another signaling cascade results in transcripts expression. alternatively, second one may explain that the addition of exogenous psy <dig> peptide in the presence of endogenous psy <dig> may cause homeostatic disturbance and a parallel signaling cascade is initiated. nevertheless, a clear response is observed after exogenous peptide treatment.figure  <dig>

interestingly, when analyzing the over-represented go categories it is found that the psy1r-independent pathway represents the cell wall modifications , while the psy1r-dependent pathway represents the response to stimuli, regulation of transcription, metal ion transport, flower development and response to abscisic acid stimulus.

identification of light-responsive cis elements in promoters of differentially expressed genes
a search for common elements  in the psy <dig> affected genes was carried out using the promomer tools in the botany array resource  <cit> . the promomer tools use alignment of sequences of genes and enumerative method to find motifs. we searched for over-represented 6-bp motifs in the 1-kb upstream promoter region . the data indicated that all putative motifs are ta rich. it is known that ta rich sequences in the core promoter region act in promoting or repressing genes at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the highly significant motifs include tatata and tgtata , which are a part of the light regulatory motif . the tgtatatat motif was previously shown to be involved in the network of light regulated genes  <cit> . this motif is found in the promoter region of  <dig> genes of psy1r mutant plants and in only two psy1-responsive gene promoters in wild type plants, accounting for 9% and 2% of all differentially expressed genes, respectively . the fourteen genes of psy1r mutant plants containing the light regulatory motif in the promoter region are: isochorismate synthase  <dig> , knox arabidopsis thaliana meinox , rxw <dig> , at1g <dig>  ovate family protein  <dig> , at3g <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> , nga <dig> , peroxidase  <dig> , sweet  <dig> , at5g <dig>  ndr1-like  <dig> , longifolia  <dig>  and at5g <dig>  the longifolia  <dig> is known to regulate longitudinal cell elongation in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . the finding of tgtatatat in differentially expressed genes of psy1r mutant plants may suggest an involvement of psy1r in light response. a separate experiment was conducted in order to test if psy1r knockout plants react differently to the lack of light. elongation of hypocotyls of etiolated psy1r plants was analyzed after 5 days of growth. comparison of hypocotyls of dark- grown plants revealed shorter hypocotyls in psy1r mutant plants compared to wild type . these results also support the view that psy1r contributes to hypocotyl cell elongation in response to light.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
small signaling peptides perceived by receptors are situated in specific cells to control growth and development by eliciting a vast array of physiological responses. psy <dig> is a secreted peptide and its action is dependent on a receptor psy1r that triggers a signaling cascade leading to cell elongation. however, the targets of this signaling pathway are yet to be studied in detail. our work revealed that addition of exogenous psy <dig> leads to transcription of cell wall modifying enzymes, enzymes that might contribute to the loosening of the cell wall during elongation. two parallel responses to psy <dig> were found to exist . this could suggest that other receptors for psy <dig> peptides exist within the plant. psy1-responsive genes encode several genes localized in cell wall that regulate carboxylestrase activity, while differentially expressed genes in psy1r mutant plants largely were localized to the nucleus with molecular function of ion binding and transcription factor activity. a major part of psy1-responsive genes were involved in cell growth, cell differentiation and catabolic processes. genome wide gene expression profiling based on go revealed that most differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular functions and response to stimuli. this suggests a crosstalk between developmental cues and environmental stimuli. a promoter analysis revealed a specific cis-element present in 9% of the differentially expressed genes of psy1r mutant plants. this element has previously been found in genes regulated by light. elongation growth of hypocotyls is closely linked to light and one can speculate that psy1r is involved in the regulation of light response.
