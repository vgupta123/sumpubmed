BACKGROUND
in plants, cell shape patterning and growth are regulated by multiple genes that are mediated by actin and microtubule cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking pathways  <cit> . the combined activities of the cytoskeleton, endomembrane, and cell wall biosynthetic systems organize the cytoplasm and define the architectural cell patterning  <cit> . genetic screens have identified a class of mutants known as distorted mutants because of their significant actin-related cytoskeletal growth-associated phenotypic defects and overall distorted cell shape patterning and abnormal polarized growth   <cit> .

genetic analysis reveals that gene that function in signal transduction cascades controlling local actin polymerization through the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit>  and the scar/wave complex  <cit>  regulate cell patterning/morphogenesis in plants. most of this knowledge comes from studies of differently distorted trichome mutants generally characterized by irregular cell expansion and polarized growth  <cit> .

in order to decipher the genetic basis of plant cell shape patterning and growth, we employed, in this study, a reverse genetic approach by screening the loss of gene expressions in arabidopsis t-dna knockout mutants to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling cell morphogenesis in plants. distorted mutants are known to display a dramatic cell shape alteration in comparison to wild type plants. the overall cell  morphology of distorted mutants has been well studied  <cit> . the distorted genes have been reported to function in signal transduction cascades that control actin cytoskeleton assembly through wave/scar2-arp2/ <dig> pathway  <cit> .

in this manuscript, we describe a new distorted gene termed curvy <dig>  that encodes a member of the receptor-like kinase  superfamily. protein kinases are generally involved in perception of general elicitors initiating signal transduction cascades regulated by protein phosphorylation  <cit>  to activate downstream responses that include the production of reactive oxygen species, ethylene biosynthesis, activation of a mapk cascade, activation of abiotic or defense gene expression and other biological processes  <cit> . in addition, rlks have also been recently related to the regulation of unidimensional cell growth, response to nitrate, and transferase activities in eukaryotes  <cit> . several protein kinases and their biological phosphorylation processes are still largely uncharacterized in arabidopsis thaliana. among the protein kinase genes, the curvy <dig>  gene appears to have a unique function related to cell morphogenesis, as cvy <dig> mutant displays phenotypes similar to distorted scar/wave and arp2/ <dig> mutant cell morphologies  <cit> . using a reverse genetic approach, we examined and characterized a salk_t-dna knockout curvy <dig> mutant  with respect to cell morphogenesis and growth phenotypes. knockout mutation in cvy <dig> caused severe trichome growth defects with relatively mild effects on overall shoot development, demonstrating that cvy <dig> functions in polarized cell growth and cell shape patterning. in addition, the work demonstrates that curvy <dig> represents a novel receptor-like kinase that regulates trichome, pavement cell morphogenesis and cell wall biogenesis among other interesting phenotypic features and might function in signal transduction cascades that control local actin assembling through the scar2/wave-arp2/ <dig> pathway.

RESULTS
genetic and phenotypic characterization of curvy <dig> mutant
to investigate the role of curvy <dig> in regulating cell morphogenesis in plants, we initiated a reverse genetic analysis of the gene using the salk collection of arabidopsis t-dna knockout lines of our in-house arabidopsis seed stock library. curvy <dig> is here shown to be important not only for polarized cell growth and trichome morphology but also other biological processes including flowering time and seed production. our data reveals that mutations in curvy <dig> gene results in strong-distorted trichomes that are similar to the scar/wave and arp2/ <dig> mutant phenotypes  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first time that curvy <dig> has been shown to control cell morphology/patterning . in addition, we investigated the role of curvy <dig> in other biological processes. we employed a reverse genetic approach using the arabidopsis t-dna salk lines mediating loss of function of curvy <dig> gene to examine curvy1-knockout phenotypes. the salk_ <dig>  line harboring a t-dna insertion in the only exon of curvy <dig> gene map  was selected and confirmed as null mutant with loss of cvy <dig> function. we confirmed the location of the t-dna using the t-dna-specific oligonucleotide primer lb <dig> and the cvy1-specific primer  and examined the cvy <dig> mrna transcript levels in wild type and cvy <dig> mutant using rt-pcr. as shown in , the t-dna insertion caused a knockout of the cvy <dig> gene in cvy <dig> mutant background. the mutation caused significant distortion of trichomes  and altered pavement cell morphology  compared to wild type. the cvy <dig> cell patterning  is not obviously different from previously characterized arp2/ <dig>  distorted mutants . the tissue specific expression pattern of cvy <dig>  is consistent with genevestigator microarray data  <cit> . the curvy <dig> gene is ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues, but particularly high in polarized cells/tissues such as the trichome, root, root tip, and hypocotyls , suggesting its importance in plant cell morphogenesis and polarized cell growth.figure  <dig>

curvy <dig> controls cell morphogenesis in plants
we confirmed that cvy <dig> morphological phenotype was indeed caused by the described t-dna insertion by constitutively overexpressing cvy <dig> gene in cvy <dig> mutant background. this complementation functionality test was performed by using agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation to introduce the 35-promoter-cvy <dig> transgene into cvy <dig> plants  <cit> . as expected, overexpression of cvy <dig> in cvy <dig> mutant background was sufficient to rescue the cvy <dig> phenotype , demonstrating that cvy <dig> gene knockout is indeed responsible for the phenotypic characterization in cvy <dig> mutant phenotype, and thus providing further confirmation of the correct genetic characterization of curvy <dig> as a new “distorted” gene. the t-dna  causing knockout mutation in cvy <dig>  is also present in mir156a  gene that targets spl <dig>  however, we ruled out the possibility of cvy <dig> mutant phenotypes being caused by a plausible insertion on mir156a gene because homozygous mir156a mutant does not have distorted trichome phenotype and the overall phenotypic complementation tests  excluded the implication of mir156a mutation in the observed/described curvy <dig> phenotypes .figure  <dig>

trichome branch length assay and pavement cell phenotypes are generally the most sensitive assays to describe phenotypic similarity among different distorted mutants  <cit> . the trichome phenotypes  of curvy <dig> mutants were indistinguishable from the well characterized arp2/ <dig> distorted mutants . in addition, cvy <dig> shape complexity of pavement-cells was significantly reduced compared to wt , but was also indistinguishable from arpc <dig> and arpc <dig> pavement cells , suggesting a conserved cell shape regulatory relationship between curvy <dig> and arp2/ <dig> in plants. the data suggests that curvy <dig> belongs to the “distorted group” of genes. arp2/ <dig> gene mutations are associated with actin cytoskeleton defects  <cit> , suggesting that curvy <dig> might regulate cell morphogenesis through signal transduction cascades that control local actin assembly through the arp2/ <dig> complex or the scar/wave complex  <cit> . in addition, we scored the stomata surface areas and found wt-stomata overall to be bigger than the stomata of mutants . we analyzed the growth of wild type, curvy <dig> mutants and the well characterized arp2/ <dig>  mutants under latrunculin b , an actin filament depolymerization drug  <cit> . the wild type , curvy <dig>  and arp2/ <dig>  were affected by latb  treatment. however, we observed a significantly stronger effect of latb on curvy <dig> mutants that was indistinguishable from the effect of latb on arp2/ <dig>  mutants , supporting the notion that curvy <dig> might regulate cell morphogenesis through actin cytoskeleton networks  <cit> . to further make the link between curvy <dig> and the actin cytoskeleton, we tested the sensitivity of cvy <dig> rescue lines to the actin depolymerization drug latb. as expected, the effect of latb on cvy <dig> rescue lines  were similar to that of the wild type . overall, these data demonstrate that curvy <dig> regulates cell morphogenesis through actin cytoskeleton functional network.figure  <dig>

curvy <dig> encodes a member of the receptor-like kinase  protein family
the rlks are integral plasma membrane associated proteins with an extracellular domain that mainly binds to a carbohydrate, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular ser/thr kinase domain  <cit> . overall, plant rlks have been reported to regulate various signaling pathways, including meristem function, brassinosteroid perception, floral abscission, ovule development and embryogenesis, plant defense, and plant morphology  <cit> . previous studies showed that selected members of arabidopsis crrlk gene family including feronia   <cit> , theseus <dig>   <cit> , hercules <dig>  <cit> , anxur <dig> and anxur <dig>   <cit>  regulate cell growth processes in different tissues under different development conditions. likewise, curvy <dig> has been found to control plant cell morphology and overall growth including flowering time, cell polarity, and actin cytoskeleton network.

curvy <dig> gene encodes a receptor-like kinase  that belongs to the catharanthus roseus rlk -like family  <cit> . rlks represent a large diverse family of proteins with approximately  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . however, the crrlk-like family comprises a conserved extracellular carbohydrate-binding malectin-like domain  <cit>  with  <dig> members in arabidopsis  and  <dig> in rice  <cit> . as expected, curvy <dig> displayed all protein features  of well characterized crrlk-like family . interestingly, all  <dig> arabidopsis members of crrlk gene family are structurally well conserved. they are exclusively made of a single exon flanked with a variable utr length structure at both 3’ and 5’ ends. nine out of the  <dig> arabidopsis members of crrlk1-like gene family are located on chromosome  <dig>  three on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively and one on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . phylogenetic analysis revealed four subclasses with curvy <dig> belonging to the larger subclass composed of  <dig> members including the well characterized theseus <dig>  and hercules <dig>  . these four subclasses suggest a diversification of arabidopsis crrlk1-like proteins based on functional specifications .figure  <dig>

actin bundles are disorganized in curvy <dig> epidermal cells
we examined the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in pavement cells of cvy <dig> mutant. the wild type  generates a significantly higher population of polarized actin bundles extending towards to the peripheral patterning of the pavement cells . the cvy <dig> pavement cells  displayed the presence of high levels of presumably diffuse and loosely aligned actin monomers and filaments, but lacking in polarized actin bundles . the actin cytoskeleton phenotype of cvy <dig> mutant is similar to what has been reported for arp2/ <dig> mutants  <cit> . the actin cytoskeleton phenotype  suggests that the curvy <dig> gene might function in a common wave/scar2-arp2/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . to further support the function of curvy <dig> through actin cytoskeleton network, we used the imagej analysis tool to quantify the number of actin bundles  in pavement cells after thresholding the stacked image to easily track/count the actin bundles. using a grid system  covering the entire pavement cell , we obtained a significantly  higher number of actin bundles in wt  compared to cvy <dig> mutant  per surface unit of the grid . consistent with the diffused and loosely aligned actin cytoskeleton phenotype of curvy <dig> , the dark grown cvy <dig> mutant displayed a loss of gravity and polarized growth orientation compared to wt . in addition, the etiolated phenotype was rescued by overexpressing curvy <dig> gene in cvy <dig> mutant plants , suggesting that curvy <dig> regulates cell morphology and polarized growth through functional actin cytoskeleton network in arabidopsis thaliana.figure  <dig>

curvy <dig> controls other biological processes in plants
interestingly, we noticed an early flowering phenotype in cvy <dig> mutants  supported by a significantly  reduced number of rosette leaves  compared to the wild type  at bolting time. unlike cvy <dig> mutants, arp2/ <dig> mutants  showed a significantly  delayed flowering phenotype compared to wt and cvy <dig> mutant , suggesting that curvy <dig> might regulate growth development through distinct signal transduction cascades to control transition from vegetative to reproductive stage. the homozygous cvy <dig> mutant  displayed a faster growth rate and higher seed pod  production compared to the wild type  and arp2/ <dig> mutants  , indicating that curvy <dig> negatively regulates cell division and growth in meristemic regions as well as the overall production of seeds. under similar growth conditions, cvy <dig> mutants produced about three-fold more seed pods  compared to wt  and 10-fold more siliques than arpc <dig> mutant . manipulating curvy <dig> gene might be a promising target to improve crop yield in higher plants. to support this observation, we weighed all the seeds of each genotype at harvest time and found cvy <dig> seeds weighing two and half times more than those of wt and five times more than seeds of arpc <dig> mutant. our data reveals that mutations in cvy <dig> gene result in early flowering, senescence, and improved seed productivity. the mechanism by which curvy <dig> regulates transition processes from vegetative to reproductive phase needs to be investigated in agronomically important crops.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we present in this work the identification of a new gene, curvy <dig> that regulates growth, cell morphogenesis and seed production in arabidopsis thaliana. this work presents evidence that curvy <dig> belongs to the “distorted group” of genes. homozygous cvy <dig> mutant displayed strong morphological phenotypes that are indistinguishable from the well-characterized distorted trichome mutants  <cit> . the curvy <dig> gene encoding a receptor-like protein kinase is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested. the distorted trichome phenotype in cvy <dig> mutant was rescued by expressing curvy <dig> gene in the mutant background. unlike the other distorted mutants, mutation of curvy <dig> gene promotes early flowering and seed production in arabidopsis thaliana. overall, curvy <dig> represents a novel receptor-like kinase gene involved in regulating cell morphogenesis, including trichome and pavement cell shape patterning through local actin cytoskeleton assembling and additionally functions in signal transduction cascades that control flowering time and seed production in plants.
