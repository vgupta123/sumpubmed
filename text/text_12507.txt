BACKGROUND
the plastid is a nearly autonomous organelle because it contains the biochemical machinery necessary to replicate and transcribe its own genome and carry out protein synthesis. within angiosperms the plastid genome includes approximately  <dig> to  <dig> genes and usually ranges in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kilobases   <cit> . of the estimated  <dig> or so distinct proteins found in the higher plant plastid  <cit>  only a small fraction are encoded by the plastid genome  <cit> . the bulk of the plastid proteome is nuclear encoded, translated on cytosolic ribosomes and subsequently translocated across the plastid envelopes  <cit> .

the circular plastid genome is divided into four regions: large single copy , small single copy  and the inverted repeat  which is present in exact duplicate separated by the two single copy regions. restriction site analysis indicates that the molecule exists in two orientations present in equimolar proportions within a single plant  <cit> . the circular molecule undergoes interconversion into a dumbbell-shaped conformation that is facilitated by the ir. concerted evolution within the ir  <cit>  suggests intramolecular recombination between the repeats may be occurring.

the advantages of plastid transformation for bioengineering are several-fold and include the integration of multiple genes in a single transformation event  <cit> , lack of gene silencing  <cit> , position effect due to site-specific transgene integration  <cit> , and minimization of pleiotropic effects due to compartmentalization of recombinant proteins  <cit> . the presence of many copies of the plastid genome within the many plastids in each cell contributes to high levels of foreign protein expression  <cit> . plastid genetic engineering could minimize transgene escape because of maternal inheritance of transgenes  <cit>  and the possibility of employing cytoplasmic male sterility to contain transgenes  <cit> .

the ability to transform the plastid genome of higher plants has facilitated the accumulation of foreign proteins previously found to be recalcitrant in plant expression systems  <cit> . until very recently breakthroughs in this regard have been limited to nicotiana tabacum  where plastid transformation has become routine  <cit> . as the field progresses to encompass the expression of vaccine antigens and other therapeutic proteins via the plastid genome  <cit> , there is a growing interest in developing a crop system for oral delivery of these recombinant products. daucus carota  has been proposed as an ideal candidate for this application for several reasons. cultivated carrot is a biennial, the reproductive structures are not present until the second year, yet the root crop is suitable for harvest in the first year  <cit> . this feature further ensures the ability to contain foreign genes in the field by eliminating the possibility of dispersal by pollen and seed. in terms of storage, the root may be realistically maintained up to six months without any processing under typical commercial conditions  <cit> . with an average annual value of over  <dig> million dollars, carrot ranks in the top ten among commercial vegetable crops in the united states adding to the interest in biotechnological improvement of this species  <cit> .

transformation of the carrot plastid genome has been accomplished, and expression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase  from spinach in carrot plastids was found to confer salt tolerance up to  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . in this case native carrot plastid sequences flanking the integration site were amplified by pcr from primers derived from the tobacco genome, due to the scarcity of carrot plastid dna sequences in the public databases. despite the potential of plastid genetic engineering, this technology has only recently been extended to a few major crops, including soybean  <cit> , carrot  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> , via somatic embryogenesis, achieving transgene expression initially via non-green plastids  <cit> . most previous studies focused on direct organogenesis by bombardment of leaves containing mature green plastids  <cit> .

although overall gene content and order are highly conserved among land plants, this same conservation is not observed in non-coding sequences such as introns and intergenic spacers , which along with the untranslated regions of genes , comprise about  <dig> % of the plastome  <cit> . genes for input traits such as insect  <cit>  and herbicide resistance  <cit> , salt  <cit>  and drought tolerance  <cit>  and pathogen resistance  <cit>  as well as output traits such as the production of therapeutic proteins  <cit>  are targeted to igs regions to avoid disruption of endogenous genes. integration of foreign sequences is dependent on homologous recombination between the transformation vector and the plastid genome. it is possible to achieve integration without 100% sequence identity between the vector and plastid genome sequence but recombination and hence transformation efficiency is impaired when sequences are divergent  <cit> . additionally, evaluations of utrs from a variety of species indicate the need to employ species-specific regulatory elements, such as promoters and translation sequences, to elevate the level of foreign protein expression  <cit> .

completely sequenced plastid genomes also provide a valuable source of phylogenetic data for resolving relationships among angiosperms  <cit> . the use of dna sequences from shared plastid genes provides many more characters for phylogeny reconstruction relative to previous molecular phylogenies based on one to several plastid genes. however, the use of complete plastid genome sequences is constrained because of limited taxon sampling, a phenomenon that can often lead to incorrect tree topologies . thus, there is an increased need to expand taxon sampling of complete plastid genomes to overcome this problem. currently there are  <dig> published plastid genome sequences of angiosperms  <cit> . some major lineages have multiple genome sequences available, especially basal angiosperms, monocots, and rosids, whereas other major clades are represented by only one or two taxa. the euasterid ii clade represents one lineage that is undersampled. this group, comprising four major subclades with approximately  <dig> families and  <dig>  species  <cit> , has only one published genome sequence from panax  <cit> .

in this paper, we report on complete plastid genome sequence of daucus carota, the first sequenced member of the family apiaceae. we describe the organization of this genome and we present a phylogenetic analysis of daucus and  <dig> other angiosperm plastid genomes based on  <dig> shared protein-coding genes. this is only the second published plastid genome sequence of the species-rich euasterid ii clade. the complete plastid genome sequence of daucus also provides valuable information for the application of plastid genetic engineering to this economically important crop plant  <cit> .

RESULTS
size, gene content, order and organization of the carrot plastid genome
the complete daucus carota plastid genome is  <dig>  base pairs  in length . the inverted repeat is  <dig>  bp and the two copies are separated by two single copy regions; the large single copy region is  <dig>  bp long and the small single copy region is  <dig>  bp. there are a total of  <dig> predicted coding regions,  <dig> of which are unique and  <dig> are duplicated in the ir. on lsc/irb boundary, the ir extends into rps <dig>  resulting in the duplication of a portion of this gene. there are  <dig> unique protein-coding genes,  <dig> of which are duplicated in the ir. also in the ir region is the ribosomal operon, which includes all  <dig> rrna genes as well as trna-ile and trna-ala. there are five additional trnas within the ir resulting in a total of  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> of which are unique. there are  <dig> genes containing introns, with  <dig> of these with only a single intron . non-coding sequences, including igs regions and introns, comprise  <dig>  % of the carrot plastome. the overall nucleotide composition is  <dig>  % at and  <dig>  %.

repeat analysis
repeat analysis identified  <dig> direct repeats and  <dig> palindromes of ≥  <dig> bp with a sequence identity of ≥  <dig> % . repeated sequences were found in igs regions, introns and within coding sequence . there are  <dig> direct repeats in ycf <dig>  with repeated sequences ranging up to  <dig> bp in length.

phylogenetic analysis
our phylogenetic data set included  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa , including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups . the data set comprised  <dig>  nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded to avoid regions with ambiguous alignment due to length variation there were  <dig>  characters.

maximum parsimony  analyses resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>   and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% and  <dig> of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. maximum likelihood  analysis resulted in a single tree with – lnl =  <dig> . ml bootstrap values also were also high, with values of = 95% for  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes and  <dig> nodes with 100% bootstrap support. the ml and mp trees had very similar topologies but differed in three places.  the mp tree placed amborella as the sister group to all other angiosperms, whereas the ml tree placed amborella sister to the nymphaeales, and together this group formed the sister group of all other angiosperms. support for the relationships of basal angiosperms in the mp tree is strong  but only moderate in the ml tree .  the mp tree placed calycanthus sister to the eudicots, whereas the ml tree positioned calycanthus as sister to a large clade that included both monocots and eudicots. support for the different placements of calycanthus was weak in both mp and ml analyses.  relationships among the rosids differed, especially the position of cucumis and the monophyly of eurosids i. the mp tree  provides strong support for the monophyly of the eurosid i clade because cucumis is sister to the three legume taxa. in contrast, the ml tree  places cucumis sister to the two examined taxa of myrtales, and support for this relationship is not as strong . these three differences were detected in recent phylogenies based on complete plastid genome sequences of basal angiosperms  <cit>  and rosids  <cit> . the remaining angiosperms formed two major clades, one including monocots and a second including the eudicots . monophyly of the monocots was strongly supported . ranunculales were strongly supported as sister to the remaining eudicots. there were two major clades of core eudicots, one including the rosids and the second including the caryophyllales + asterids. both mp and ml trees provide very strong support  for the sister relationship of daucus with panax in the euasterid ii clade.

discussion
implications for plastid genetic engineering
an important agricultural crop worldwide, carrot has long attracted attention from the research community. it was the first crop species in which somatic embryogenesis was demonstrated  <cit> . this ability, to regenerate entire plants from cell or tissue cultures, has helped to maintain interest in carrot as our technology has advanced to include the improvement of agronomic species via genetic manipulation. the carrot nucleus has been the recipient of foreign genes to confer input characteristics such as pathogen resistance  <cit>  and herbicide resistance  <cit> . recently an extensive analysis of four agrobacterium rhizogenes strains and twelve daucus carota genotypes examined the utility of green fluorescent protein  as a selectable marker for nuclear transformants  <cit>  demonstrating continued interest in this system for expression of foreign proteins.

most interesting has been the exploration of carrot as an ideal platform for the production of proteins of significance to pharmacology. the small isoform of human glutamic acid decarboxylase  has been identified as a major autoantigen contributing to the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus   <cit> . expression of the gad <dig> cdna in transgenic carrot and tobacco resulted in an immunoreactive product which retained appropriate enzymatic function. unfortunately levels of expression were quite low for both tobacco leaves and carrot taproots, on the order of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of total soluble protein , respectively  <cit> . a heterologous version of human gad <dig> having the n-terminus substituted with gad <dig> from rat was expressed in tobacco and was able to achieve stable accumulation of functional immunoreactive product up to  <dig> % of the tsp. although oral administration of disease associated autoantigens such as gad <dig> can lead to the induction of tolerance in the murine model, dosage on the order of milligrams per week per mouse are required  <cit> . expression levels and stable accumulation will have to be improved by orders of magnitude to make oral dosage truly feasible.

vaccine antigens have been expressed in a number of plant species  <cit> , including carrot. transformation experiments have introduced a hemagglutinin glycoprotein  <cit>  and a novel chimeric polyepitope antigen  <cit> , both for neutralizing immunization against measles virus into the carrot nuclear genome. extracted proteins demonstrated immunogenicity, raising antibody titers in sera of injected mice. however, quantitative data on protein accumulation in transgenic plants is lacking, especially for taproots. an estimate based on elisa of 2% of membrane fraction in crude membrane preparations from carrot leaf is offered, but no mention is made of protein content in the root  <cit> . it is noteworthy that these extracts were homogenized with freund's adjuvant  prior to initial injection and at each boost. freund's adjuvant is employed to enhance antibody formation suggesting that plant extracts from nuclear transformants were insufficient to induce the desired immune response.

the need for an alternative expression system to obtain high levels of protein accumulation in carrot roots becomes apparent if efficacious oral delivery is to be accomplished. furthermore a system for oral delivery of antigens should ideally include the adjuvant, limiting further the need for post harvest processing. transformation of the plant plastid has demonstrated the capacity to produce substantial quantities of functional and immunoreactive proteins .

stable transformation of the daucus carota plastid genome via somatic embryogenesis has been demonstrated recently  <cit> . integration of foreign genes in these experiments was accomplished through the use of flanking sequences that were pcr-amplified from the native carrot plastid ribosomal operon, whereas the regulatory sequences used to facilitate expression of the transgenes were derived from tobacco and bacteriophage t <dig>  when assayed for badh enzyme function, roots of carrot plastid transformants showed activity up to  <dig>  % of leaf tissue. in root tissues, plastome copy number is generally about  <dig> % of the level in mature leaves. the notably high activity is probably due to the elevated concentration of root chromoplasts in carrot, the plastid type responsible for the orange coloration. with the availability of the entire carrot plastid genome sequence, it will now be possible to incorporate native translation regulatory sequences into transformation constructs to further enhance foreign protein accumulation in carrot plastids. additionally, detailed knowledge of this genome will allow the identification of optimal intergenic spacer regions for the integration of transgenes.

receptor-mediated translocation of antigens and other pharmaceutical proteins across the intestinal mucosa offers the potential to make plant-produced, orally delivered vaccines and therapeutics a reality. the toxin of vibrio cholerae  is recognized as one of the most potent mucosal adjuvants. the holotoxin is composed of the a subunit, responsible for toxicity, and the non-toxic homopentameric b subunit , which facilitates entry into epithelial cells of the intestine by binding the gm <dig> receptor followed by endocytosis. recombinant forms excluding the a subunit are rendered non-toxic, and when fused to another antigen, the b subunit cannot only carry this antigen across the intestine, but also strongly potentiate the antigen's immunogenicity  <cit> . recently a fusion construct of ctb and gfp expressed in transplastomic tobacco demonstrated the efficacy of ctb to deliver foreign proteins to the circulatory system of mice, which were fed pulverized leaf tissue from plastid transformants. between the two protein sequences investigators included the cleavage site for the ubiquitous protease furin to facilitate the intracellular cleavage of gfp. quantitative elisa revealed accumulation of ctb-gfp in transgenic plants ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of tsp. following oral administration of ctb-gfp expressing leaf material to mice, fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the presence of gfp in the mouse intestinal mucosa, liver and spleen while ctb remained in the intestinal cells  <cit> . remarkable levels of protein accumulation coupled to a receptor-mediated oral delivery mechanism offers realistic hope for the possibility of plant-derived, orally delivered therapeutic proteins.

genome organization and evolution
the daucus genome with two copies of an ir separating the ssc and lsc regions is identical in architecture to most sequenced angiosperm plastid genomes  <cit> . the size of the genome at  <dig>  bp is also within the known range for angiosperms, which generally vary from  <dig>   <cit>  to  <dig>  bp  <cit>  for taxa that have both copies of the ir. the size of the daucus ir at  <dig>  bp is at the upper end of the size range of other sequenced genomes, which vary from  <dig>    <cit>  to  <dig>   bp  <cit> . gene content and order of the daucus plastid genome are identical to panax  <cit> , the only other published euasterid ii genome.

a number of recent comparisons of plastid genomes of angiosperms have identified dispersed direct and inverted repeats  <cit> . the carrot genome contains similar numbers and sizes of repeats to these other angiosperms . in most cases, these repeats are located in intergenic spacer regions and in introns but several also occur in trnas and protein-coding genes. examination of repeats in highly rearranged algal and angiosperm genomes have demonstrated a correlation between both the number and location of the repeats and the propensity for rearrangements  <cit> . the role of dispersed repeats in unrearranged plastid genomes remains unknown.

phylogenetic implications
the phylogenies based on  <dig> protein-coding plastid genes for  <dig> angiosperms  are largely congruent with relationships suggested by previous studies based single and multiple genes  <cit>  and a number of recent phylogenies based on complete plastid genome sequences  <cit> . there is strong support for the monophyly the major clades of angiosperms, including monocots, eudicots, rosids, asterids, eurosids ii, asterids i and asterid ii. the three areas of incongruence between the mp and ml trees regarding relationships of basal angiosperms, calycanthus, and eurosids i were identified previously  <cit> , and are likely due to limited taxon sampling and misspecification of model parameters in large concatenated, multigene data sets.

the position of caryophyllales within angiosperms has been controversial in the past. previous molecular phylogenies clearly indicated that this order is a member of the eudicot clade  <cit> , but relationships of caryophyllales to other major eudicot lineages remains uncertain. the order has been suggested to be allied to rosids, asterids, or simply as an unresolved major eudicot clade sister to the dilleniaceae  <cit> . two recent phylogenies based on  <dig> shared plastid gene sequences provided support for a sister relationship between the caryophyllales and asterids  <cit> , however, only a single representative of the euasterid ii clade was included. the addition of the daucus plastid genome to this data set increases the level of support for a sister relationship of asterids and caryophyllales .

finally, the multiple plastid gene phylogenies also provide strong support for the monophyly of the euasterid ii clade . this result is not surprising given that the araliaceae  and apiaceae  have been considered sister families for a long time based on both morphological and molecular data  <cit> . expanded taxon sampling of the other three major clades of euasterids ii is needed to further test the monophyly and relationships of this large, diverse angiosperm clade.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first sequenced plastid genome of the family apiaceae and only the second published genome sequence of the species-rich euasterid ii clade. both mp and ml trees provide very strong support  for the sister relationship of daucus with panax in the euasterid ii clade. these results provide the best taxon sampling of complete chloroplast genomes and the strongest support yet for the sister relationship of caryophyllales to the asterids.

the availability of the complete plastid genome sequence should facilitate improved transformation efficiency and foreign gene expression in carrot through utilization of endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements. the ability to express high levels of foreign protein, particularly those of clinical interest, makes plant plastids an attractive target for biotechnology. as a biennial crop which is amenable to relatively long term storage, carrot taproots may provide a feasible platform for the production of pharmaceutical proteins for oral delivery. the availability of the complete plastid genome sequence should facilitate improved transformation efficiency and foreign gene expression in carrot through utilization of endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements.
