BACKGROUND
rna editing is a process that results in the synthesis of proteins that are not directly encoded in the genome. one type of rna editing involves the modification of individual adenosine bases to inosine in rna by adar enzymes   <cit> . because inosine acts as guanosine during translation, a-to-i conversion in coding sequences leads to amino acid changes and often entails changes in protein function  <cit> . a-to-i rna editing is common in animals and is associated with various neurological functions  <cit> . caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster and mus musculus mutants lacking adar enzymes display predominantly distinct neurological phenotypes  <cit> . in addition to amino acid changes, the editing and subsequent destabilization of the rna duplex present in the 5' or 3'-untranslated regions  could alter the stability, transport or translation of the mrna  <cit> . moreover, rna editing may influence alternative splicing decisions  <cit> .

alternative splicing is a major contributor to transcriptomic and proteomic complexity, disease, and development. alternative splicing may affect the protein sequence in two ways:  by deleting or inserting a sequence and creating long and short isoforms, or  by substituting one segment of the amino acid sequence for another  <cit> . an indication for the first pathway is that truncated isoforms often act as dominant-negative regulators of the full-length isoform's activities  <cit> . in contrast, the second mode is capable of creating, from mutually exclusive alternative sequences, a multitude of functionally distinct protein isoforms and thus might have a crucial role in the evolution of complex organisms  <cit> . as both rna editing and alternative splicing can lead to the inclusion of alternative amino acid sequences into proteins, functionally distinct isoforms are likely to be generated  <cit> . therefore, editing and alternative splicing provide a powerful posttranscriptional means for fine-tuning of gene expression at the cellular and organismal levels.

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  mediate the fast actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine  in both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . an extraordinary feature of the insect nachr genes is that they can potentially create many different mrnas by rna editing and alternative splicing. more than  <dig>  alpha <dig> nachr isoforms are theoretically possible through rna editing and alternative splicing, without considering any linkage between these events  <cit> . the alternatively spliced exons are organized into two clusters. the exon  <dig> and  <dig> clusters contain  <dig> and  <dig> alternative versions, respectively  <cit> . seven adenosines could be modified in d. melanogaster alpha <dig>  four of which are also edited in the alpha <dig> ortholog in the tobacco budworm heliothis virescens. however, although these rna a-to-i editing sites are conserved between d. melanogaster and h. virescens, they are not shared with the equivalent nachr subunit of anopheles, which is considered to be an example of convergent evolution  <cit> . it is possible that different alpha <dig> isoforms may interact with distinct sets of receptor guidance cues. rna editing and alternative splicing of the nachr alpha <dig> pre-mrna may therefore be central to the mechanisms specifying transmitter affinity, channel conductance and ion selectivity.

the recently sequenced genomes of  <dig> drosophila species  <cit> , the mosquito a. gambiae  <cit> , the silkworm b. mori  <cit> , the honeybee a. mellifera  <cit> , and t. castaneum  <cit>  have renewed interest in molecular and functional diversity in the insect nachr alpha <dig> gene. recent analysis reveals bees and wasps  are at the base of the radiation of holometabolous insects  <cit> . here, we compare the rna editing and alternative splicing of the nachr alpha <dig> gene from these insects spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution. these sequence comparisons provide insight into the evolution of the nachr alpha <dig> gene and indicate that many isoforms have arisen by rna editing and alternative splicing events. these findings also suggest that expressing a diverse nachr alpha <dig> repertoire is more important than the actual sequence of each isoform. in this article, we describe the a-to-i rna editing and alternative splicing found in insect nachr alpha <dig> genes, as well as their evolutionary conservation and divergence, and regulation. in addition, we provide an example of a strong correlation between rna editing and alternative splicing.

RESULTS
comparison of the nachr subunit alpha <dig> genes from different insect species
to obtain insight into the functional diversity, the regulation of expression, and the evolution of nachr alpha <dig>  we have compared the sequence of the nachr alpha <dig> genes in drosophila to other species. the organisms analyzed consisted of  <dig> dipteran species, including  <dig> drosophila species  and one mosquito , the lepidopteran b. mori , the coleopteran t. castaneum  and the hymenopteran a. mellifera . the sequences from these species allowed us to analyze the evolution of the nachr alpha <dig> gene over at least  <dig> million years and across phylogenetic orders. the overall organization of the nachr alpha <dig> genes of these insect species is quite similar, but there are a few subtle differences. the nachr alpha <dig> genes possess two versions for exon  <dig> in most species, while no such tandem duplication of coding exon  <dig> can be found in the a. mellifera genome. although nachr alpha <dig> genes have three versions for exon  <dig> in most species, only two alternatives for the equivalent exon are observed in the a. gambiae and b. mori genomes.

we next analyzed the evolutionary relationship of the alternative exons from d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, b. mori, t. castaneum and a. mellifera nachr alpha <dig> genes. for these analyses we used d. melanogaster as the representative drosophila species. phylogenetic analyses indicated that a. mellifera did not contain an ortholog to the second alternative exon  <dig> while b. mori and a. gambiae lacked an ortholog to the first alternative exon  <dig> <cit>  . the orthologs to the second alternative exon  <dig> were very highly conserved, with all amino acid sequences identical , although they are not highly conserved at the nucleotide level. the hierarchy of amino acid conservation of the alternative exons  <dig> of nachr subunit alpha <dig> genes was exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c. phylogenetic analysis of the protein products of equivalent duplicated exons showed that members of a duplicated pair were more similar to each other than to the exons from other genes . this evidence suggests that exon duplication predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution.

we next analyzed the evolutionary relationship of the alternative exons within the drosophila species. all three exon  <dig> variants had orthologs in each species. all three exon  <dig> orthologs were very highly conserved in these species, and were identical at the amino acid level. surprisingly, the orthologs to the alternative exon 8b were identical even at the nucleotide level. we determined a similar hierarchy of nucleotide conservation of the alternative exons  <dig> of nachr subunit alpha <dig> genes within the drosophila species, namely exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c.

conservation and divergence of alternative splicing
we were interested in understanding the alternative splicing of the nachr alpha <dig> transcripts and in particular whether this is regulated. we first analyzed how the alternative exons  <dig> were regulated. the vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons  are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events  <cit> . the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  showed a very clear band in d. melanogaster and t. castaneum adult cdna, as in a. mellifera with constitutive exon  <dig> . direct sequencing of these amplification products confirmed that these duplicated exons were alternatively spliced . sequence analysis of  <dig> cdnas also showed that no duplicated exons were spliced together. these results indicated that the vast majority of exons were likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing, which was consistent with est and cdna data analysis, although a duplicate of exon  <dig> was even found in cdna  <cit> .

the rt-pcr showed a distinct pattern in b. mori , not seen in d. melanogaster and t. castaneum. total silkworm rna harvested from silkworms at various stages of development was used as a template for rt-pcr with primers surrounding the exon  <dig> . at the embryo stage, only one band could be amplified, and direct sequencing indicated a mixed sequence signal of two nucleotides, confirming the existence of alternative splicing of exon  <dig>  the existence of alternative splicing in the embryonic transcripts was further confirmed by independent sequencing of cloned cdnas of rt-pcr products. this band, which resulted from type i and type ii alternative splicing, decreased slightly during development, exhibiting a very low level in the pupal and adult stages . however, another slightly larger band appeared during development, displaying a very low level in the larvae but increasing rapidly during the stages from pupa to adult . sequencing of cloned cdnas of this product indicated the existence of splice type iii alternative splicing, which included both alternative exons, and retained the opening frame of the spliced rna.

to elucidate how the alternative splicing patterns of exon  <dig> were developmentally regulated, we designed the specific primers based on three alternative variant cdnas . consequently, the expression of splice type i and ii appeared to be tightly regulated in a similar manner, exhibiting an abundant level in the embryo, and decreasing slightly during the pupal stage to the adult level. in contrast, the expression of splice type iii showed a distinct mode during development, exhibiting a very low level in the embryo, and increasing rapidly during the pupal stage to the adult level . the expression analysis using rt-pcr was consistent with the results derived from rt-pcr clones . thus, the alternative splicing patterns of exon  <dig> in silkworm were different from the other insect species.

next, to determine how the alternative exons  <dig> were regulated developmentally, we first performed rt-pcr on rna isolated from silkworm embryos, larvae, pupae and adults by use of primers flanking exon  <dig>  the identity of the pcr product was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. sequence analysis of transcripts, derived from different staged rna independent amplification experiments, indicated that only cdnas containing exon 8b were included, but no cdna containing exon 8c was included. this suggested that only exon 8b was spliced while exon 8c expression was very low in these developmental stages. we next tested whether the selection pattern of exon  <dig> alternative splicing observed in silkworm was conserved in d. melanogaster, t. castaneum and a. mellifera, where nachr subunit alpha <dig> has three versions for exon  <dig>  interestingly, rt-pcr analysis revealed an identical hierarchy of selection efficiency among d. melanogaster,t. castaneum and a. mellifera: exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c . considering the identical trend between selection efficiency and conservation of alternative exons  <dig>  it is proposed that expression of alternative exons  <dig> might be closely related with its conservation . this phenomenon might reflect evolutionary trajectories and/or differential functional constraints.

evolutionary conservation and divergence of nachr alpha <dig> rna editing
similar to substitution alternative splicing, rna editing causes amino acid changes by substituting individual nucleotides. although rna a-to-i editing occurred in drosophila transcripts, it was not present in the equivalent nachr subunit of anopheles  <cit> . to determine whether orthologous nachr subunits were also rna-edited in other insect species, we have subsequently analyzed the nachr alpha <dig> genes from b. mori, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. several sites were either determined as pure g signals, or as mixed sequence signals of g and a, while the nucleotide in the reference genomic dna was a at these positions. we also checked for genetic variation in these alpha <dig> regions, using pcr amplification on silkworm genomic dna, applying primers surrounding the equivalent regions and direct sequencing. as a result, it was revealed that the nucleotide in genomic dna was adenosine at these positions, confirming that post-transcriptional modifications occur in this case. we have identified a total of ten a-to-i rna editing sites within silkworm alpha <dig> transcripts, seven of which are located in exon  <dig> . sequence analysis of transcripts showed that six amino acids could be changed by seven possible a-to-g transitions in exon  <dig> .

we have subsequently analyzed the nachr alpha <dig> genes from t. castaneum and a. mellifera. we demonstrated that editing also occurred in both the alpha <dig> homolog of t. castaneum and a. mellifera, with a quite different pattern of editing . these sites were originally discovered through sequence analysis of cdnas that were subsequently compared with genomic dna. in each case, a was observed in the genomic sequence with g at the corresponding position in numerous cdnas. a-to-i rna editing occurred across the species except a. gambiae with its extraordinarily short flanking intronic sequences . there are up to  <dig> a-to-i rna editing sites in a. mellifera. during the preparation of this paper, six a-to-i rna editing sites were found in a. mellifera  <cit> , which were identical with  <dig> of the  <dig> rna editing sites in our experiment. the editing sites  <dig> and  <dig> in nachr alpha <dig> were conserved among the four orders of insect, represented by d. melanogaster, b. mori, t. castaneum and a. mellifera . the rt-pcr clone data revealed that editing was detectable at site  <dig> in b. mori and a. mellifera, as in drosophila, albeit at a very low level. site  <dig> was edited at low levels in d. melanogaster, but almost completely edited in b. mori, and undetectable in t. castaneum and a. mellifera. interestingly, site  <dig> was specifically edited in a. mellifera but it constituted a genomically encoded g in other species. sites  <dig> and  <dig> were markedly edited in a. mellifera, while editing was undetectable in other species. in contrast, site  <dig> was edited in d. melanogaster, b. mori and t. castaneum, but undetectable in a. mellifera . overall, editing sites and levels of the alpha <dig> homolog differed among species, possessing conserved and species-specific editing sites in each species. however, this was the most highly conserved rna editing event yet reported in invertebrates.

some a-to-i editing sites were a genomically encoded g in other species
the nachr subunit alpha <dig> genes were subject to rna editing in d. melanogaster, b. mori, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. interestingly, there were several examples in which some a-to-i editing sites were a genomically encoded g in some species. for example, the alpha <dig> site  <dig> was edited in b. mori and a. mellifera, while the site  <dig> in the alpha <dig> ortholog α7– <dig> in the tobacco budworm h. virescens  was a genomically encoded g . the site  <dig> was edited in a. mellifera, while the homologous sites in a. gambiae, h. virescens, b. mori and t. castaneum were a genomically encoded g . similarly, the alpha <dig> site  <dig> was edited in drosophila  <cit> ; however, the alpha <dig> homologous sites in other species were a genomically encoded g . although we did not know how general this phenomenon was, this led us to consider the possibility that rna editing might act as an evolutionary intermediate form between single nucleotide polymorphism  sites, maintaining partial conservation at the protein and functional level despite sequence divergence at the dna level.

correlation between rna editing and alternative splicing
the vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons  are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events  <cit> . the alternative splicing patterns of the duplicated exon  <dig> were conserved in the chosen insect species, except the silkworm. it remained to be determined whether the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons was changed because the signal ensuring the splicing of pairs of alternative exons was disturbed in the silkworm. rt-pcr and direct sequencing of the cdnas derived from adult transcripts showed that two a-to-g substitutions occurred in exon  <dig> of the silkworm nachr subunit alpha <dig> gene . however, these two a-to-g substitutions were undetectable in embryonic transcripts. interestingly, sequence analysis of  <dig> cdna clones derived from embryonic, larvae, pupae and adult transcripts, respectively, revealed two a-to-g substitutions in exon  <dig> of the silkworm in splice type iii, but not in splice types i and ii. pcr amplification of silkworm genomic dna and direct sequencing revealed that adenosine was the nucleotide in the genomic dna at both positions, confirming that a-to-i editing occurred in this case. these results suggest that specific editing in exon  <dig> and splice type iii of exon  <dig> might be closely related.

to determine whether coordinated rna editing and alternative splicing were conserved in other insects, we subsequently analyzed the nachr alpha <dig> genes from d. melanogaster, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. in contrast to the silkworm, sequence analysis indicated that no a-to-g substitutions took place in exon  <dig> in these species. these results suggest that rna-editing sites in exon  <dig> are species-specific in b. mori, which correlates with the species-specific alternative splicing pattern of the duplicated exon  <dig>  to discern whether alternative splicing also correlates with rna editing in other distant exons in the silkworm, we analyzed the a-to-i rna editing sites in exon  <dig> of the nachr subunit alpha <dig> gene. however, no evidence indicated any relation between alternative splicing patterns of exon  <dig> and editing in distant exon  <dig>  suggesting that the alternative splicing patterns of exon  <dig> was not regulated by rna editing in distant exon  <dig> 

discussion
evolutionary implications
our results indicate a high level of editing events in insect species spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution. interestingly, rt-pcr analysis showed that rna editing was absent in a. gambiae, indicating a divergence in molecules targeted by rna editing within the diptera order  <cit> . interestingly, enzyme assays measuring conversion of adenosine to inosine in salivary gland homogenates of several mosquito species detected adenosine deaminase activity in culex quinquefasciatus and aedes aegypti, but not in a. gambiae  <cit> . however, syt i is also edited in mosquitoes, sharing two editing sites with drosophila species, and one mosquito-specific site  <cit> . this suggests that adenosine deaminase functions in the anopheles lineage, as in drosophila. a comparative sequence analysis of these species showed that the exon  <dig> was highly conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid level among these species , but the flanking intronic sequences were highly divergent. the downstream intron  <dig> was extraordinarily short in length,  <dig> bp, in a. gambiae, while it was >  <dig> kb in drosophila, >  <dig> kb in b. mori, >  <dig> kb t. castaneum, and >  <dig> kb in a. mellifera, respectively . likewise, the upstream intron  <dig> was also extraordinarily short,  <dig> bp, in a. gambiae, while it was much more than  <dig> kb in the other insect species . the absence of editing in anopheles correlated with the lack of downstream intronic sequences, which were necessary to direct editing by forming duplex rna substrates for adars within larger, energetically stable rna secondary structures. similarly, sequential decrease and loss of editing in a. gambiae, through weakening of the ecs-editing site interaction to form poorer duplex rna substrates for adars, could titrate in the edited form of the protein to the least advantageous level, or even an undetectable level.

rna editing conserved between the orders diptera and lepidoptera for one nachr gene was previously considered an example of convergent evolution  <cit> . however, our phylogenetic analysis of rna editing in orthologous nachr alpha <dig> genes from different species revealed a divergent evolution from a common ancestor. moreover, this implies that divergent evolution from a common ancestor would have been accompanied by editing loss or gain in paralogous genes. we suggest that the data presented here comprise a credible phylogeny of rna editing for a gene, graphically illustrating descent with modification . rna editing in insect nachr subunit alpha <dig> genes predates at least the radiation of the coleopteranand hymenopteran orders, beginning with sites  <dig> and  <dig>  new editing sites were probably generated and ancestral editing sites were lost in subsequent evolution through global intronic variation . our evidence suggests that anopheles lost editing in the nachr alpha <dig> gene during the evolution of the diptera; such a loss might be consistent with the phylogenic evolution of the introns. the nachr alpha <dig> genes possess tandem duplication of coding exons in their genomic sequences in insect species, which represents alternative spliced exons. dating exon duplications through a combination of the available experimental data on alternative splicing in orthologous genes from different species and computational analysis indicated that the exon  <dig> and  <dig> duplications predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution. our results disproved the previous hypothesis that a duplication event gave rise to exon 8b and 8c before the divergence of an ancestor of drosophila and anopheles, whereas after the divergence a further duplication gave rise to an extra exon  in the drosophila lineage  <cit> . however, our evidence suggests the possibility that divergent evolution from a common ancestor was accompanied by exon loss and generation of paralogous genes . in the nachr alpha <dig> gene, our evidence suggests that recent loss of copies of duplicated exons has occurred . moreover, divergent evolution from a common ancestor would have been accompanied by change in the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons in paralogous genes 

rna editing and snp sites
the nachr subunits alpha <dig> are subject to rna editing in insect species. interestingly, there were several examples where some a-to-i editing sites were a genomically encoded g in closely- related species. although we do not know how general this interesting phenomenon is, this led us to consider the possibility that mrna editing might act to maintain similarity at the protein and functional level despite sequence divergence at the dna level. in plant mitochondria, mrna editing might act to maintain similarity at the protein level  <cit> . some genetic restoration events in plants and animals are proposed to be the result of a template-directed process that makes use of an ancestral rna-sequence cache  <cit> . therefore, the edited rna-sequence might be taken as a template to synthesize dna, thus causing changes at the dna level. in addition, the most prevalent changes of substitutional rna editing in the nucleus of higher eukaryotes are hydrolytic deaminations where a genomically encoded c or a is converted to u and i, respectively  <cit>  interesting, a/g and c/t substitution were much more prevalent than other forms of snp. given these relations between rna editing and snp, it is pertinent to ask whether rna editing might be an evolutionary predecessor to genomically fixed snps.

regulation of mutually exclusive alternative splicing
rna editing and alternative splicing play an important role in expanding protein diversity and are commonly employed to enlarge the proteome. since both processes may require conserved exonic and intronic elements, rna editing may influence alternative splicing decisions or vice versa. there are a few examples of an association between alternative splicing and editing  <cit> . as rna editing usually occurs close to exon/intron boundaries, this is likely to be a general phenomenon and suggests an important and novel role for rna editing  <cit> . moreover, the adar <dig> protein regulates its own synthesis by creating an alternative splice site that leads to an out-of-frame product  <cit> . the auto-editing of adar <dig> intron  <dig> by the adar <dig> adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide aa to ai creates a new 3' splice site  <cit> . the editing site and the affected splice site are usually in close proximity to one another, and so rna editing affected alternative splicing by creating or deleting splice sites  <cit> . only one example indicates that the editing efficiency of a drosophila gene correlates with a distant splice site selection where alternative splicing occurs downstream of editing. in contrast, no correlation is seen when editing occurs downstream of alternative splicing  <cit> . however, the result remains to be determined without considering the fact that rna editing and alternative splicing are not regulated by similar developmental patterns.

in this study, rna editing could affect the alternative splicing pattern by another mechanism because no new splice sites were generated or deleted. the vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons  are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events  <cit> , therefore, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the splicing of pairs of alternative exons is strictly mutually exclusive, involved in competing base-pairing interactions  <cit> , the steric hindrance of snrnp binding  <cit>  and the dual spliceosome mechanisms  <cit> . if the signal involved in these mechanisms was disturbed, the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons might be changed. taken together, a model can be proposed to explain how editing and alternative splicing of pre-mrna is coordinated. rna editing in exon  <dig> might disrupt a splicing enhancer signal within exon  <dig>  which can prevent the exon  <dig> cluster from splicing together. the disrupted splice site is now more efficient at splicing out the shorter intron, leading to the longer product. it is not exactly clear how an enhancer within this exon would alter the choice of a distant acceptor site, but there are previous studies showing that longer introns tend to be flanked by stronger splice sites  <cit> . to test whether a-to-i editing disrupts exon splicing enhancer  elements, we analyzed edited and unedited exon sequences with an ese-finder program  <cit> . a-to-i editing in two sites was predicted by the ese-finder to destroy the sf2/asf  and srp <dig>  ese motifs, respectively. taken together, our results suggest that ese disruption is the underlying mechanism of a-to-i editing that results in the change of the alternative splicing pattern. conversely, if rna editing does not occur, for example, in the silkworm embryo and in d. melanogaster and t. castaneum, mutually exclusive alternative splicing of the duplicated exons has arisen in the majority of transcripts. alternatively, a-to-i editing might disrupt the other splice signals within exon  <dig> in the silkworm nachr subunit alpha <dig>  which controls mutually exclusive splicing of the duplicated exons. one protein has recently been identified that prevents all of the duplicated exon variants from being spliced together, which demonstrates that the duplicated exon variants are in fact capable of being spliced together but protein factors exist that repress this reaction  <cit> . a-to-i editing possibly relieves the repression on the upstream alternative duplicated exons, and as a result, the duplicated exon variants might be spliced together.

CONCLUSIONS
we have documented the existence, evolutionary conservation, and regulation of rna editing and alternative splicing in nachr alpha <dig> from five insects spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution– d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, b. mori, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. a combination of the experimental data and computational analysis of orthologous alpha <dig> genes from different species indicated that rna editing and alternative splicing predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~ <dig> million years of evolution; however, they might be lost in some species during subsequent evolution. the occurrence of alternative splicing was found to be developmentally regulated, and even correlated with rna editing in some cases. interestingly, some a-to-i editing sites represented a genomically encoded g in other species. phylogenetic analysis of rna editing and alternative splicing, which are capable of creating the multitude of functionally distinct protein isoforms, might have a crucial role in the evolution of complex organisms beyond nucleotide and protein sequences.
