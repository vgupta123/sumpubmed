BACKGROUND
huntington's disease  is one of several hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of a cag repeat in the respective disease genes. in hd, unstable cag expansion within the coding region of the it <dig> gene is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract near the n-terminus of the protein called huntingtin   <cit> . while mutation analysis and transgenic animal models for disease have unequivocally identified the expanded polyglutamine tract as key in toxicity  <cit> , the mechanism by which mutant htt  progressively kills brain cells is poorly understood.

long polyglutamine tracts are known to form hydrogen bonded, β-sheets  that are prone to aggregation  <cit> . indeed, aggregates called inclusion bodies have been identified in human disease tissue for all polyglutamine disorders  <cit> . aggregates were found to affect vital cellular functions and accelerate cell death  <cit> . suppression of aggregate formation has been shown to be beneficial in cell models for hd and is accepted as one of the markers of successful therapeutic approaches  <cit> . consequently, aggregate formation has served as a phenotype in screening of small molecules and peptides for their inhibitory properties that promote cell survival in mhtt-expressing cells  <cit> . screening of the ninds custom collection of fda approved drugs for their ability to prevent aggregation has produced a number of compounds including gossypol, gambogic acid, juglone, celastrol, sanguinarine and anthralin. although each compound effectively reversed aggregation of amino terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin  with  <dig> polyglutamines in vitro, none of these molecules was effective in promoting survival of r6/ <dig> mice, a model representing the most severe hd phenotype  <cit> . thus, blocking aggregate formation, by itself, may not be a definitive predictor of the efficiency of potential therapeutics. additionally, mhtt has multiple cellular interacting partners and confers many adverse effects in cells  <cit> . since no single physiological process has yet been identified as the primary therapeutic target, better functional screening phenotypes would be necessary in order to evaluate the effectiveness of particular compounds.

we have previously synthesized and examined the biological activity of a number of tricyclic pyrone  analogs and found that tp compounds directly bind to and inhibit formation of amyloid-β  aggregates in cell model representing alzheimer's disease   <cit> . moreover, 2-week treatment with cp <dig>  dramatically reduced formation of non-fibrillar and fibrillar aβ oligomers in vivo in mouse model representing familial ad  <cit> . thus, tps represent a promising class of compounds with anti-aggregate properties. however, whether tp compounds could prevent aggregate formation in other neurodegenerative disorders has not been studied. it is also unknown whether tp compounds could ameliorate earlier cellular defects that preclude aggregate formation in the cells.

in our early study, we have established a cellular model that allowed assessment of the effect of mhtt-induced aggregate formation on survival of primary neurons, cells that are most vulnerable in hd  <cit> . in this model, transfection of primary neurons from control mice with gfp-tagged truncated mhtt fragment  caused rapid formation of aggregates that marked late events in hd progression. recently, we identified cellular dysfunctions that arise early in disease progression prior to aggregate formation. we demonstrated that expression of full-length mhtt causes cholesterol accumulation and inhibition of clathrin-independent caveolin- <dig> -related endocytosis in embryonic striatal neurons from hd <dig> mice  <cit> . these observations lead us to test whether tp compounds could effectively prevent mhtt-induced aggregation and restore early cellular defects associated with hd. we also reported synthesis and evaluation of biological activity of a new tp compound, tp <dig> , which was modified to possess higher functionality and ability to penetrate blood-brain barrier. we found that treatment with tp compounds not only prevented aggregate formation caused by expression of truncated form of mhtt in both primary neurons and glial cells, but also reduced cholesterol accumulation and restored endocytosis inhibited by expression of full-length mhtt.

RESULTS
synthesis of a new tricyclic pyrone analogue, tp4
previously, we found that tricyclic pyrone molecules, cp <dig> and tp <dig>  inhibit formation of toxic aβ oligomers and prevent cell death in mc <dig> cells conditionally expressing a partial β app fusion protein , c <dig>  <cit> . structurally, cp <dig> and tp <dig> compounds consist of a tricyclic pyranopyrone skeleton and an adenine moiety attached on its n3' or n9' to the c <dig> isopropyl group of the fused cyclohexane ring . the n3'-molecule, cp <dig>  is ten times more efficient in preventing cell death in mc <dig> cells than the n9'-derivative tp <dig>  <cit> . however, the bioactivity of tp compounds where the methyl group at c <dig> atom will be substituted with other groups that could enhance their solubility in water has not been examined. to investigate the effect of c3-substituent, we synthesized a cp <dig> analogue, tp <dig> , possessing an acetoxyethyl group at c <dig> and compared its biological activity with that of cp <dig> and tp <dig>  we previously synthesized cp <dig> and tp <dig> compounds via a sequence of reactions starting from compound  <dig> , derived from a one-pot condensation reaction of 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone and --perillaldehyde  <cit> . compound tp <dig> was similarly synthesized from compound  <dig>  by a deprotonation with lithium diisopropylamide  followed by formaldehyde and then acetic anhydride  to give compound  <dig>  it should be noted that the hydroxyl intermediate derived from the reaction of compound  <dig> with formaldehyde is an unstable compound, which undergoes reverse aldol reaction to produce compound  <dig> and formaldehyde under weakly acidic conditions. hence, protection of the hydroxyl function with an acetyl moiety is needed. selective hydroxylation of compound  <dig> with boranethf followed by oxidation with naoh-h2o <dig>  mesylation of the resulting hydroxyl function with methanesulfonyl chloride , and displacement with adenine in n, n-dimethylacetamide  afforded tp <dig>  cp <dig>  tp <dig> and tp <dig> were purified using hplc with acetonitrile, water and trifluoroacetic acid   as solvents. the pure solids obtained after lyophilization were stable water-soluble tfa salts.

treatment with tp compounds at low concentrations does not cause toxicity in embryonic neurons
effective pharmacological compounds must be non-toxic to cells. to evaluate the toxicity of tp compounds, primary embryonic  striatal neurons from fvb control mice were cultured and treated next day after plating with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm of different tps. cells were kept under these conditions for  <dig> days. every other day, the neuronal morphology and the extent of cell death were evaluated by imaging of five randomly selected fields . for all tp compounds tested, concentrations below  <dig> μm did not cause significant cell death for up to  <dig> days in culture . about 60% of neurons remain healthy and preserve their morphology. however, concentrations above  <dig> μm effectively killed cells in less than  <dig> days . at day  <dig> in culture, for each tp compound, we determined the lethal dose at which 50% of the cells died  . the results suggested concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm were least toxic for all tps tested. survival of hd neurons in response to tp treatments did not differ from control cells . thus, we used these conditions in the following experiments.

treatment with cp <dig> inhibits aggregation in primary embryonic neurons expressing mhtt
previously, we have shown that treatment with cp <dig> and tp <dig> effectively prevent aβ aggregation in cell and animal model for ad  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether tp compounds can also prevent aggregation caused by expression of mhtt. it has been well documented, that expression of a truncated form of mhtt with expanded polyglutamine region leads to rapid formation of intracellular aggregates  <cit> . indeed, transfection of neuronal cultures from control mice with gfp-hd <dig>  a truncated form of human htt  with pathologic  <dig> polyglutamine repeats, leads to rapid formation of visible aggregates in both primary striatal neurons and glial cells within 2– <dig> hours post transfection . aggregates are visible as green puncta indicated with arrows). however, treatment of striatal cultures with cp <dig> from the day of plating eliminated formation of inclusions in neurons and reduced aggregate formation in glial cells by 90% relative to untreated cells . aggregation was specific to expression of gfp-mhtt with expanded polyglutamine tract since no aggregates were formed in cells transfected with control plasmid expressing a short gfp-htt fragment with  <dig> polyglutamines  . thus, cp <dig> efficiently inhibited aggregation caused by expression of truncated form of mhtt in neurons and glial cells at the concentrations as low as  <dig> μm.

treatments with tp compounds do not affect the expression of mhtt
control experiments were performed to examine the effects of tp compounds on the expression of mhtt. we plated neurons from hd mouse and treated cells with different doses of cp <dig> , tp <dig> , and tp <dig>  for  <dig> days starting from the first day of plating. treated and untreated hd cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to the western blot analysis using specific monoclonal anti-huntingtin antibody  <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . results are shown in figure 3c and data indicated that treatments with tp compounds do not affect expression of mhtt in primary neurons from hd mice .

treatment with cp <dig> restores clathrin-independent endocytosis inhibited by expression of mhtt
since aggregate formation is a late event in disease progression, we next investigated whether cp <dig> treatment could alleviate early cellular dysfunctions associated with hd. recently, we have shown that expression of full-length mhtt causes abnormal cholesterol accumulation and inhibition of clathrin-independent caveolin-related endocytosis in embryonic striatal neurons from hd <dig> mice early in disease progression prior to aggregate formation  <cit> . thus, we first tested whether cp <dig> treatment could restore defective endocytosis associated with mhtt expression in striatal neurons from hd <dig> mice.

internalization of essential extracellular components in neurons occurs through multiple endocytic pathways including clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent caveolin-related endocytosis  <cit> . in order to evaluate whether cp <dig> treatment could restore defective endocytosis in hd <dig> neurons, we monitored internalization of fluorescently labelled cargoes specific for each pathway. alexa fluor 594-labeled transferrin, tfn, was used as a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> , and bodipy-lactosylceramide, laccer, as a marker for clathrin-independent caveolin-related endocytosis  <cit> . consistent with previous observations, expression of mhtt had no effect on tfn internalization in hd <dig> neurons comparing to control cells . treatment with either  <dig> or  <dig> μm of cp <dig> also did not affect tfn internalization or intracellular localization in hd <dig> neurons comparing to control or untreated hd <dig> cells . these data suggest that neither cp <dig> treatment nor mhtt expression affected clathrin-mediated endocytosis in striatal neurons. in contrast, the uptake of laccer was inhibited by 70% in hd neurons relative to control cells . however, pre-treatment with  <dig> μm of cp <dig> restored the uptake of laccer in hd cells to approximately 60% of that in control neurons . thus, cp <dig> partially restores lipid trafficking defect caused by expression of mhtt, and the beneficial effect of cp <dig> is evident prior to visible formation of aggregates.

treatment with tp compounds prevents cholesterol accumulation in neurons caused by expression of mhtt
since cp <dig> has been found to restore lipid trafficking in primary striatal neurons expressing mhtt, we next investigated whether cp <dig> and its analogues could also avert another early cellular defect found in hd neurons, the accumulation of cholesterol  <cit> . to test this, we plated embryonic  striatal neurons from control and hd <dig> mice and immediately treated them with  <dig> μm of different tp compounds. neurons were kept under continues tp treatment for  <dig> days, then cells were fixed and intracellular levels of free cholesterol were estimated and compared to untreated neurons using filipin staining. filipin is an antibiotic that specifically binds free cholesterol and could be visualized under the uv light  <cit> . consistent with our previous data, untreated hd <dig> neurons accumulated significant amounts of cholesterol after  <dig> days in culture relative to control neurons . in contrast, in hd <dig> neurons kept in the presence of  <dig> μm cp <dig> cholesterol levels did not increase and were similar to control neurons  <dig> days after plating . thus, cp <dig> treatment effectively prevented accumulation of cholesterol caused by mhtt expression.

next, we compared the efficiency of different tp compounds in preventing cholesterol accumulation in embryonic striatal hd neurons . in control neurons, pre-treatment with cp <dig>  tp <dig> or tp <dig> did not affect cholesterol levels as measured using filipin  <dig> days after plating . however, treatment with  <dig> μm of tp <dig> or tp <dig> was as efficient in lowering cholesterol in hd neurons as treatment with cp <dig> . all tp compounds effectively prevented cholesterol accumulation in hd neurons reducing it to the levels observed in control cells. thus, tp compounds appeared not only to efficiently prevent aggregation caused by expression of mhtt, but also suppress early cellular dysfunctions in hd neurons that precede aggregate formation.

discussion
the use of small molecules to inhibit specific protein-protein interactions and prevent aggregation has important potential therapeutic application  <cit> . the fact that in most neurodegenerative disorders faulty proteins form fibrils with very similar structure suggests that it is feasible to find the molecular approach that could be effectively applied in many disease  <cit> . however, formation of detectable aggregates usually occurs later in disease progression and may not represent the primary cause of cellular dysfunction. therefore, it is important to evaluate whether specific treatment modalities could not only inhibit aggregation, but also alleviate cellular dysfunctions that occur early in disease progression.

previously, we reported that tricyclic pyrone molecules, cp <dig> in particular, directly bind aβ  <dig> oligomers and prevent formation of aβ fibrils in cellular and mouse models for ad  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that tp compounds also efficiently block aggregate formation in hd. pre-treatment with cp <dig>  the most efficient aggregate inhibitor in the ad cell model, blocked formation of aggregates caused by expression of truncated form of mhtt in both cultured primary striatal neurons and glial cells. moreover, treatment with tp compounds alleviated early cellular defects associated with hd that preclude aggregate formation. specifically, tp treatment partially restored clathrin-independent endocytosis and eliminated cholesterol accumulation in mhtt-expressing neurons. it will be important to test whether tp compounds demonstrate similar efficacy in vivo in animal models representing hd.

htt is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels in neurons  <cit> . both htt and mhtt interact with a large variety of cellular proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics  <cit> , clathrin-dependent and independent endocytosis  <cit> , axonal transport  <cit> , postsynaptic signaling  <cit>  and transcription  <cit> . expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in htt alters its interactions with cellular proteins disrupting their functions and contributing to pathology  <cit> . in our previous study, we demonstrated that application of cav <dig> sirna restored clathrin-independent endocytosis and eliminated cholesterol accumulation in hd neurons suggesting that interaction between mhtt and cav- <dig> underlies these cellular defects  <cit> . in the present experiments, treatment with tp compounds did not affect cellular levels of mhtt or cav- <dig> in neurons . thus, it is feasible that tp compounds could bind mhtt and not only prevent its aggregation but also block mhtt interaction with its targets. preventing aberrant interactions could be beneficial, however additional experiments to demonstrate the specificity and efficiency of this approach are necessary.

originally, tp compounds were synthesized based on the structures of pyripyropene a, an inhibitor of acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase   <cit> . acat is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident enzyme that regulates intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by converting excess free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters  <cit> . acat inhibitors have been shown to effectively suppress generation of aβ, the major toxic component of senile plaques in ad, the disease where cholesterol is known to be an important risk factor  <cit> . one of the explanations of the reduced free cholesterol levels in the cells is the demonstration that acat inhibitors increase the expression of cholesterol efflux transporter atp-binding cassette transporter  <dig>   <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of acat action remains to be elucidated. we found that all three tp compounds used in this study, while only partially restoring clathrin-independent endocytosis, effectively reversed mhtt-induced cholesterol accumulation in hd neurons. these observations suggest that tp compounds possess a complex mechanism of action. first, they may act as small molecules that directly bind faulty proteins preventing aggregation and blocking protein-protein interactions. additionally, they may also affect cholesterol homeostasis by regulating cellular cholesterol efflux.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated that tp compounds effectively inhibit mhtt-induced aggregation in hd neurons and glial cells. additionally, treatment with tp compounds alleviated cholesterol accumulation and restored clathrin-independent endocytosis, early neuronal defects caused by expression of full-length mhtt that preclude aggregate formation. our data suggest tp compounds may be used as lead molecules for prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including hd and ad.
