BACKGROUND
in order to make full use of the growing amount of sequence information, in terms of increasing our knowledge of protein function, engineering new variants of known proteins, developing biomedical applications, etc, structural information is clearly required  <cit> . indeed, one of the most important challenges in the post-genomics era is to fill the gap between the large number of known protein sequences and the still relatively small number of known structures  <cit> . structural genomics projects have addressed this challenge and have led to the design and development of high-throughput production pipelines for structure determination  <cit> . this considerable research effort is starting to give results and recent reports show a clear increase in the number of known structures, and particularly of structures showing new folds, solved in structural genomics projects  <cit> .

providing experimental structures for all possible proteins clearly exceeds our present capacity. therefore, the yield of structural genomics projects is increased by the use of comparative/homology modelling tools  <cit> . indeed, the latter are of great importance as they allow the extension of the knowledge provided by structural genomics projects by at least one order of magnitude  <cit> . however, the usefulness of homology models varies and is determined by their quality  <cit> . drug design  requires high quality models that are usually obtained for sequence identity  levels above 70% between the target and template  <cit> . useful designs of pseudo-molecules fitting the active site of an enzyme, which can be employed for screening small-compound databases, can be obtained at seq.id. of around 30%  <cit> ; medium to high-accuracy models can be applied to interpret the damaging effect of point mutations  <cit> , etc. a series of independent studies  <cit> , as well as the results of casp experiments  <cit> , give the user of comparative modelling a good idea of the model's overall performance, and how the latter can be estimated from the seq.id. between the target and template sequences.

most of these studies address quality issues regarding the model as a whole; however, because many applications of homology models depend on the quality of the biologically crucial parts of the protein  <cit> , more recent work either includes specific analyses of these sub-structures <cit>  or is completely devoted to the same  <cit> . among the points addressed is the hypothesis that some functional regions are better modelled than others because of their higher sequence and structure conservation  <cit> . analyses of casp experiments provide contradictory evidence either supporting  <cit>  or rejecting  <cit>  this hypothesis. along another line, de-weese and moult  <cit>  used casp data to explore how ligand binding information can be obtained from comparative models. these authors analyzed the errors in protein-ligand contacts as well as the source of these errors . they found that when there are no alignment errors, comparative models provide a useful understanding of the interaction between the protein and its ligand, even at seq. id. levels of around 30%. complementary to these casp-based studies, recent large-scale studies of comparative models have also considered the quality of protein functional regions  <cit> . in these two studies, the authors describe the behaviour of several global, structure-dependent properties, such as accessible surface area and electrostatic potential, in comparative models  <cit> . in addition to examining these global properties, the authors also analysed the degree of conservation of protein clefts in terms of location and boundary residues. they reported that:  spurious clefts appear as seq.id. decreases;  the more similar the target and template sequences, the more conserved the clefts; and  clefts in models have a more rugged surface than in the experimental structure.

the work by de-weese and moult  <cit>  and by sanchez's group  <cit>  provides a valuable, but still incomplete, picture of how the quality of functional cavities is preserved in comparative models. in the case of de-weese and moult's work  <cit> , the reach of their results is limited by the following: the reduced number of proteins and models studied,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively; the consideration of only small molecule binding; and the fact that the analysis is based on the use of essentially one variable, distance root-mean-square deviation. sanchez's group  <cit>  studied a series of structure-based properties, including clefts. more precisely, in the case of clefts, their work was restricted mainly to the issue of the degree of their preservation between the experimental structure and the model. however, apart from the ruggedness study, no shape descriptors were used to specifically define cleft quality in protein models. in summary, and to the extent of our knowledge, there is no exhaustive study entirely devoted to assess how cleft structure varies in comparative models. here we address this issue and examine the quality of clefts in protein models obtained at a range of target-template seq.id. levels, using six variables that cover various features of cleft structure. although we provide data for the entire seq.id. range, we focused on the behaviour of comparative models in the medium  and low  ranges for the following reasons:  the quality of homology models above 60% seq.id. is usually high  <cit> ;  biochemical function above 60% seq.id. is usually conserved  <cit> ;  target selection protocols in structural genomics projects usually rely on a 30% seq.id. threshold to obtain a maximal coverage  <cit> ; and  comparative modelling is possible below 30% seq.id. because the protein structure is preserved below this threshold  <cit> . the study was carried out using  <dig> comparative models  for  <dig> protein cath domains  <cit> . our results provide a detailed and quantitative view of how cleft quality varies in comparative models and constitute a valuable guide for users of this structure prediction technique. more precisely, we  quantitatively show the dependence between several descriptors of cleft quality and seq.id. between target and template sequences;  demonstrate that a certain number of good quality models up to 20% seq.id. can be found; and  indicate that above 30% seq.id. cleft quality approaches that obtained when using the best possible alignments .

RESULTS
in table  <dig> we show the range of seq.id. levels between target and template sequences for the models examined. while the whole sequence range was covered, the vast majority of the models clustered in the 0% – 60% interval, which constitutes the main focus of this study. sequence alignments within this range showed a considerable number of non-aligned residues, which, in general, resulted in poorly modelled regions  <cit> . for this reason, we restricted our analysis to those clefts for which all contouring residues were aligned to a template residue.

the domains chosen were distributed over the four cath  <cit>  classes , sampling  <dig> architectures and  <dig> topologies, thus giving a good coverage of the structure space of protein domains.

clefts were computed for each experimental protein structure using surfnet  <cit> , which provides a list of clefts. we chose the largest cleft from this list because it is the one that is most likely to play a relevant functional/structural role. furthermore, in whole proteins this cleft is usually associated with the biochemical function of the protein, by either participating in protein-protein interactions, or hosting the enzymes' active site  <cit> . in our case, in addition, because we considered protein domains, the largest cleft may also correspond to the locus of domain-domain interactions that determine the structure of the whole protein, thus playing an equally important structural role. however, given that smaller clefts may have a functional role in some cases, we also provide results for the top-five clefts.

shape changes
to explore how well clefts were reproduced in the models, we used six variables : root-mean-square deviation , normalized root-mean-square deviation , global distance test , protrusion index , variation in accessible surface area  and contact number . rmsd is widely applied in many areas of structural analysis, and in particular has been successfully used in the characterization of shape variations in binding sites  <cit> , a problem formally analogous to that addressed in the present study. rmsd <dig>  <cit>  is a transformation of rmsd that eliminates the size dependence present in the latter and its use allowed us to exclude size biases from our results. gdt, developed within the context of casp experiments  <cit> , is a quality measure that helps to detect the presence of well preserved sub-structures in otherwise bad models, thereby helping to prevent the sensitivity of rmsd to outliers. cx is a simple measure of the protrusion degree of protein atoms, related to the atomic environment, that can be used to characterise binding sites, cleavage sites, etc  <cit> . asa  <cit>  is a shape descriptor that has been extensively employed in protein structural analysis to describe, amongst others, energetic and functional features, such as atom-atom interactions  <cit> , protein solvation  <cit> , protein-protein interactions  <cit> , etc. finally, Δcn, which is directly derived from Δasa  <cit> , provides an approximate idea of how comparative models preserve the capacity of cleft atoms to establish functional interactions.

rmsd
rmsd between the observed structure of the protein and the homology model was computed considering only the set of atoms defining the cleft in the former . as a control, and to assess the limits introduced by the model building procedure itself, we employed the results of the auto-modeling process in which a model for the target protein was produced using its own experimental structure as template. our results provide a basal line that corresponds to the limits of the modelling software – modeller  <cit>  in our case- and includes the impact of the distinct approximations implicit in the different steps of the structure building process – e.g. the force field employed, the minimization protocol, the internal protein representation, etc.

cleft rmsd varied depending on the seq.id. between the target and the template sequences  . as expected, we observed that as the latter increased, cleft rmsd decreased, asymptotically approaching auto-modelling values. most of the cleft models that showed poor conservation were found at seq.id. levels of less than 20%, where rmsd values were, in general, very high . the number of good models increased with seq.id., and even in the 20% – 40% range well over 50% of the models showed clefts with rmsds below  <dig> Å. this observation indicates that even within this seq.id. range there are clefts that could be used for applications such as low-resolution compound screening, function identification, etc, as long as they can be singled-out from the background of low-quality cases. over 40% seq.id., a plateau was reached, with ~50% of the cases clustering between  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å. these results indicate that even at very good seq.id. levels it may be difficult to reach the limits of the modelling method because of the effect of small sequence changes, the presence of bound ligands, crystal contacts, etc  <cit> . thus even above 40% seq.id., standard modelling protocols may not be good enough for applications that require accurate models of the protein clefts of the target protein. a greater modelling effort – e.g. using molecular dynamics simulations  <cit> , or conformational searches of the non-aligned regions, using de novo procedures like rosetta  <cit> , or modeling of the active site using specific templates  <cit> , or, eventually, experimental determination of the target structure, may be required in these cases. our results are partly consistent with the picture arising from the work of deweese and moult  <cit> , and show that in some cases good cleft models can be found even below the 30% threshold proposed for target selection protocols for structural genomics projects  <cit> . however, the sharp quality decrease observed for seq.id. levels lower than 20% indicates that below this threshold conventional sequence alignment methods in most cases will result in very poor models. similar results were obtained when plotting rmsd as a function of cleft seq.id. instead of whole-protein seq.id. .

to illustrate the rmsd results with specific examples, figure  <dig> shows three cases where the first cleft observed in the target's experimental structure is highlighted in models obtained at distinct seq.id. levels. while the global shape and location of the cleft were preserved above 30% seq.id., this was not the case for seq.id. below this threshold. the impact that shape changes may have on the modelling of protein-ligand interactions is exemplified in figure  <dig>  where the ligand  is shown with the same orientation it has in the experimental structure of the complex. even at high seq.id., the structure of the cleft may not be of sufficient quality to properly reproduce the protein-ligand interaction pattern.

to complete the previous view, we explored the relationship between cleft and backbone quality. this is an important point, particularly when considering further refinement of the models with techniques such as molecular dynamics, which, a priori, treat all protein atoms equally. when sufficiently large and in absence of specific restraints, the poorly modelled parts may prevail over the better parts, thus resulting in an effective degradation of the latter. this may occur when attempting to refine comparative models in which functional clefts are better modelled than the rest of the protein because of functional constraints  <cit> . in our analysis we divided the previous cleft rmsd data in three classes, on the basis of backbone quality : high , medium  and low . we found  that above 30% – 40% seq.id. a considerable proportion of the clefts showed an rmsd lower than the corresponding backbone rmsd, particularly for high and medium quality backbones. two main opposing factors are likely to contribute to this trend: the existence of functional constraints acting on the first cleft and the presence of poorly modelled parts in the rest of the structure. the former would result in better cleft rmsd and the latter in poorer backbone rmsd. regardless of the case, our results suggest that subsequent refinement of initial models obtained within the 40% – 100% seq.id. range may require the application of several restraints to the cleft contouring atoms, at least in the first steps, in order to preserve the initial cleft quality. for lower seq.id. levels, overall model refinement could eventually result in an improvement in cleft quality.

rmsd100
the meaning of rmsd as a quality measure depends on the size of the elements compared  <cit> , that is to say, while  <dig> Å rmsd may indicate high similarity when comparing  <dig> residue proteins, it may suggest poor resemblance if small active sites are compared. because the clefts considered in this study were of distinct sizes, we used rmsd <dig>  <cit> , a normalized rmsd which is independent of size. the behaviour observed for rmsd <dig>  was comparable to that found for raw rmsd , showing the same asymptotical trend towards auto-modelling values and the large variability within seq.id. bins. in addition, we also found the quality transition between 10% and 30% seq.id. present in the rmsd data . this confirms the independence of our main results from cleft size.

gdt
gdt is a summary measure directly related to the presence of quality/well-preserved sub-structures within the model, and works by identifying the percent of atoms modelled below a given distance threshold  <cit> . application of a range of distance thresholds provides a complete view of how quality varies within the predicted structure; in our case we used four commonly used thresholds  <cit> ,  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å,  <dig> Å and  <dig> Å, which result in four gdt values, gdt_ <dig>  gdt_ <dig>  gdt_ <dig> and gdt_ <dig>  smaller thresholds were discarded as we focused mainly on seq.id. below 60%, where models tend to be of poor quality. after considering the results for the four thresholds  together, cleft models were divided into two classes on the basis of seq.id.. above 30% seq.id, a considerable proportion of the clefts showed large gdt_ <dig> and gdt_ <dig> values, indicating the presence of high-quality sub-structures. because of the a priori value of these parts, this result supports the use of post-modelling analysis for their identification , as they may provide a good starting point for further refinement of the cleft model. in contrast, models below 30% seq.id. showed few or no high quality sub-structures . in the medium quality threshold , corresponding to gdt_ <dig> values, a non-negligible fraction of cleft models below 30% seq.id. showed sub-structures of such quality. these sub-structures may not be useful for highly demanding applications, such as drug design, but may be a reasonable starting point for further refinement of the model, or provide a coarse-grained view of some aspects of protein function, e.g. rough shape of the binding site  <cit> .

side-chain atoms constitute a large fraction of the set of cleft contouring atoms. because side-chains are usually hard to model  <cit> , we studied their contribution to cleft quality. to this end, for each cleft we computed the ratio, which we called r, between two percentages: the percentage of side-chain atoms in the list of atoms contributing to a given gdt  and the percentage of side-chain atoms in the cleft's set of contouring atoms. if, side-chain and main-chain atoms are modelled with equal accuracy r will be equal to one. however, if side-chains are poorly modelled than main-chain atoms r will be lower than one . we focused our analysis on gdt_ <dig> and gdt_ <dig> values because these identify high-quality modelled sub-structures. the results for gdt_ <dig> and gdt_ <dig> are provided as additional file . when we plotted the distribution of r values , we observed that auto-modelling r values were slightly lower than  <dig>  indicating that even in this ideal situation the modelling of side-chain atoms is poorer than main-chain atoms. if we now consider our set of models, in general, r values were below  <dig>  but approached asymptotically auto-modelling values as target-template seq.id. increased. this observation indicates that main-chain atoms make a stronger contribution to the best-modelled parts of clefts; however, as seq.id. increased side-chain building improved and their contribution almost reached the limits imposed by the modelling software. the large fluctuations in r observed in the 0% – 30% seq.id. range , in particular for gdt_ <dig>  were probably a consequence of inaccurate main-chain modelling, which in turn resulted in an almost random building of side-chains. as alignment quality improved so did backbone accuracy, thereby leading to better built side-chains, which in turn resulted in better r values for seq.id. above 30%, an improvement that was particularly notable for gdt_ <dig>  on the basis of these results, an increase in cleft quality could be expected after improving the side-chain modelling, for example using the scrwl package  <cit> . however, results from sanchez's group  <cit>  indicate that surface properties are not particularly sensitive to better side-chain modelling, and cannot be improved by the single use of scrwl  <cit> . instead, these authors report that improvements in the force field, e.g. better solvation term, may be required to correctly model surface properties  <cit> . an alternative option to extract more information from available cleft models, or at least to explore the cleft's conformational space, would be the use of restrained molecular dynamics  <cit> . in this approach all model atoms are frozen except those defining the protein's active site, which are allowed to move freely, subject to covalent restraints with the rest of the structure. the resulting trajectory gives an approximate view of correlations between residues, cleft volume, etc, which may be useful in the design of coarse-grained probes to screen small molecule 3d databases  <cit> .

cx
cx is a volume ratio  that gives a local measure of the atomic environment that can be related to function  <cit> . we computed the percentage of cleft atoms for which the cx value varied between the observed and the model structures and examined how this number varied with target-template seq.id.. to exclude noise corresponding to small experimental fluctuations, we followed a simple protocol . we first obtained a set of  <dig> structure pairs with each pair member corresponding to a different experimental version of the same structure. we then computed the difference in cx for all pairs of equivalent atoms and plotted the resulting distribution . for over 99% of the cases, the difference in cx was between - <dig> and  <dig>  on this basis we considered that: for any given atom cx had varied between the experimental and the model structures when the difference in cx was larger than  <dig> in absolute value.

the atomic local structure of cleft models obtained at seq.id. above 30% – 40% was almost equally well preserved along the whole seq.id. range . in contrast, for seq.id. below 20% – 30% the percentage of atoms with cx values varying between observed and model structures increased substantially, showing a transition similar to that found for rmsd data . this finding indicates that cleft structures for models obtained at low seq.id levels show large changes in both their global  and local  features. the cx result was also consistent with the lack of common sub-structures observed in gdt_ <dig> and gdt_ <dig>  analyses. taken together, these results indicate that model refinement at this seq.id. requires large conformational searches, or introduction of external restraints  in order to obtain true improvements.

Δasa and Δcn
to complete the picture, we explored the changes in atomic asa experienced by clefts in comparative models. this analysis complements previous analyses as changes in asa are related to protein energetics, e.g. solvation free energy  <cit>  or free energy of atom-atom interactions  <cit> . this analysis provides an approximate idea of how well we can model native interactions of the target protein with other molecules  <cit>  – either quaternary structure partners, small substrates or designed drugs. to this end, we divided our set of models in three quality groups: low , medium  and high . for each of these quality bins, we computed the change in asa for all atoms of the largest cleft . in accordance with our previous results, asa changes  tended towards the auto-modelling values as seq.id. increased;  were larger the lower the quality of the model; and  the distributions for medium and high quality models differed substantially from that of low quality models. the latter was more spread over the Δasa range, a result that completes cx results , thereby confirming the presence of significant local changes in the atomic environment. we also observed that changes in asa values were evenly distributed around zero, indicating that the modelling protocol introduces no substantial biases towards exposing or burying cleft atoms.

as mentioned previously, a number of applications of comparative modelling, like drug design or study of enzyme-substrate interactions, require accurate modelling of native atomic interactions between the target protein and another molecule . to provide an estimate of how modelling of these interactions may vary in comparative models, we used an additional parameter, Δcn , which is computed from Δasa using an approximated relationship proposed by colonna-cesari and sander  <cit> : Δcn ~  <dig> Δasa. Δcn gives a rough idea of how changes in solvent accessibility can modify the ability of cleft atoms to establish interactions with other molecules.

we found  that even for high-quality models almost 25% of cleft atoms had Δcn values around three. this indicates that these atoms had either gained  the ability to establish three non-native interactions or lost  their ability to establish three native interactions, on average. furthermore, while this situation was comparable for medium-quality models, for low-quality models the figure rose to over 40% of the cases.

factors affecting cleft quality
finally, we studied the effect of several factors contributing to cleft quality, focusing on two related issues:  the effect of non-aligned cleft contouring residues; and  the maximal improvement we could obtain when optimal target-template alignments were available. we also examined whether cleft quality was affected by differences in protein fold, or cleft rank , although these results are provided separately as additional files . to take into account the size effect, we used rmsd <dig> in all cases.

non-aligned residues lead to poorly modelled regions  <cit> . we therefore focused on clefts in which all residues were aligned. however, in some cases when the number of non-aligned residues is relatively small, the restraints imposed by the rest of the structure  <cit>  may result in acceptable models for this structural region. to explore this idea, our analysis included all models with a small fraction  of non-aligned residues affected. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of cleft models with 100% or at least 75% of residues aligned to the template, respectively. the latter tended to show poorer rmsd <dig> values in the medium  and high seq.id.  range. however, the differences were not so large as to exclude the usefulness of these models. in the low identity range , alignment quality was too low to result in reasonable cleft models, even when all residues were aligned.

within this context we attempted to establish the maximal quality that can be reached by improving sequence alignment. this point is of particular relevance since it may help the user of comparative modelling to determine whether it is worth investing time and effort in ameliorating the target-template alignment. to this end, instead of sequence alignments we used structure-based alignments as input to modeller. these alignments were obtained, for all target-template pairs, using the mammoth suite  <cit>  and correspond a priori to the best alignment obtained between two sequences. when comparing the rmsd <dig> distributions for models obtained using either sequence or structure alignments  we distinguished two scenarios. below 30% seq.id., cleft models derived from structural alignments were clearly better that those obtained from sequence alignments. this finding shows that, in this case, improving sequence alignments is beneficial. however, above 30% seq.id., sequence-sequence alignments improved and cleft quality started to depend more on having all cleft residues aligned , or on factors related to the template structure, such as crystal contacts, presence of bound ligands, etc, mentioned in previous sections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide a quantitative view of how the quality of protein clefts varies in comparative models, depending on the seq.id. between the target and template sequences. our results show how cleft quality – measured using rmsd, rmsd <dig>  gdt, cx, asa and contact number- is related to target-template seq.id.. when considered together, these analyses consistently show that below 20% seq.id. cleft quality undergoes a clear decrease, both from a global  as well as from a local point of view . this finding suggests that even between 20% and 30% seq.id., useful models of protein clefts can be obtained, although the use of quality assessment tools is strongly advised, due to the important proportion of poor models within this seq.id. range. once identified, the cleft model may be subject to subsequent refinement steps aimed at improving quality, e.g. using global model refinement , although the greatest improvement is likely to result from the use of good alignments . above 30% – 40% seq.id., the main restriction to model quality is determined by the template selected . within this seq.id. range, overall backbone structure tends to deteriorate more than cleft structure, probably because of functional restraints on the latter. therefore, further model refinement should probably freeze, at least partly, the structure of the cleft, to prevent degradation. overall, our work goes beyond previous studies  <cit>  presenting a complete view of how the structure of protein clefts varies in comparative models, which constitutes a useful guide for researchers interested in the study of protein function using comparative modelling methods.
