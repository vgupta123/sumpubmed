BACKGROUND
crohn's disease  is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the intestinal tract characterized by a strong activation of the intestinal immune system. a complex interaction of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors contribute to the immunopathology of cd but despite intensive investigation over the last half-century, a unifying etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases  has not been uncovered  <cit> . abundant clinical and experimental data implicate luminal bacteria or bacterial products in both the initiation and perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation  <cit> . some pathological manifestations observed in cd, including ulcers of the mucosa, mural abscesses and macrophage recruitment and activation, also occur in well-recognized infectious diseases caused by shigella, salmonella and yersinia, in which invasion into mucosal epithelial cells is an important virulence trait  <cit> . however, a growing body of evidence indicates that the balance between host defence responses and the commensal microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ibd  <cit> . patients with cd display an increased number of coliforms in their feces, particularly during periods of active disease  <cit>  and e. coli antigens are found in most intestinal resection specimens from these patients  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that early and chronic ileal lesions of cd patients harbour high levels of e. coli that might participate in disease pathogenesis  <cit> . e. coli strains isolated from the ileal lesions of cd patients can exhibit adherent and invasive capabilities in both gastrointestinal epithelial cells and macrophages  <cit> , a phenotype that was the basis for a new pathogenic group called adherent and invasive e. coli   <cit> . aiec are enriched in ileal lesions in human cd  <cit>  and are associated with expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation in mice expressing human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  receptors  <cit> . the predominance of aiec in human cd patients, in conjunction with a growing body of biological and animal model data  <cit>  has generated intense interest into the possible role of aiec in the initiation or maintenance of chronic inflammation associated with cd.

we previously reported on a clinical aiec isolate with serotype o83:h <dig>  that was isolated from the terminal ileum of a patient with cd  <cit> . nrg857c belongs to the same serogroup as the historical aiec isolate called lf <dig> first described over a decade ago  <cit>  for which much of the experimental data on aiec phenotypes have been documented. aiec do not harbour common virulence factors found in various other pathogenic e. coli, and so the genetic basis for their invasive phenotype, proinflammatory nature and association with cd are not fully understood. here, we report the complete genome sequence of aiec nrg857c that includes a 150-kb plasmid. we found that aiec are closely related to a group of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  associated with urinary tract infections and neonatal meningitis, a finding that confirms and extends previous work  <cit> . the comparison of this genome with other expec, enteropathogenic e. coli, aiec lf <dig>  and commensal e. coli facilitated the identification of  <dig> high-confidence genomic islands and  <dig> genes unique to e. coli displaying the adherent and invasive phenotype.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and gap closure
aiec strain nrg857c was shotgun sequenced to 40-fold coverage using pyrosequencing. assembly of the raw sequence data generated  <dig> contiguous regions  greater than 2-kb with a total size of  <dig> -mb. contigs were assembled by aligning the larger contigs to an optical restriction map using mapsolver and by blastx analysis of contigs ends. the majority of gaps between contigs were identified because contigs ends were syntenic with single-copy genes in previously sequenced e. coli genomes. pcr primers were designed to amplify across these gaps followed by sequencing to generate "super-contigs" . final gap closure was achieved after incorporation of sequence data for the seven ribosomal rna operons. plasmid contigs were identified by blastx analysis. gap closure for the plasmid was done using blastn analysis of the terminal sequences from which pcr primers were designed. amplification and sequencing of these regions resulted in the assembly, but not closure, of a single plasmid contig.

general features of the nrg857c aiec genome
the chromosome of nrg857c is  <dig> , <dig> bp , encoding  <dig>  genes . the plasmid is  <dig>  bp  and encodes  <dig> genes . the sequence of both the nrg857c chromosome and plasmid has been deposited in genbank .

phylogenetic position of nrg857c
the phylogeny of aiec nrg857c was resolved in two ways. first, a phylogenetic tree based on the optical map data was constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  along with the in silico derived ncoi fragments for other sequenced e. coli strains . the second method involved multi-locus sequence typing  with seven housekeeping genes as described previously  <cit>  , followed by comparison to sequences from other strains  <cit> . in both analyses nrg857c clustered with avian pathogenic e. coli , and the uropathogenic e. coli isolates  <dig> and cft <dig>  also in this group was lf <dig>  another aiec strain of the same serotype as nrg857c  whose genome sequence was retrieved from genoscope . lf <dig> shows high sequence similarity to our strain as analyzed by mapsolver , by blastn analysis , and by phylogenetic analysis .

a general comparison of the total genome content of nrg857c with several other e. coli pathotypes is shown in table  <dig>  the majority of human expec belong to phylogenetic group b <dig> and are categorized based on their clinical spectrum of disease, including urinary tract infections  and neonatal meningitis   <cit> . aiec strains cluster genetically with expec and share some of their phenotypic traits including the ability to colonize mucosal epithelial cells, invade eukaryotic host cells, and to induce inflammatory responses in host animals  <cit> . although the prototype epec strain e2348/ <dig>  and other epec strains belong to the same phylogenetic group as the expec strains  <cit> , they are not generally considered to be invasive organisms. however, recent data suggests that at least two type iii secreted proteins  can facilitate epec invasion into non-phagocytic cells and may define a new category of invasive epec  <cit> .

genomic islands and unique sequences associated with aiec
genomic islands  comprise a horizontally acquired flexible gene pool that is a major driver in evolution and niche specialization of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . recent computational methods that take advantage of genetic signatures indicative of horizontal gene transfer enable the high-confidence prediction of gis in annotated bacterial genomes  <cit> . to identify putative genomic islands in nrg857c, we used islandviewer, which uses three independent methods for island prediction, islandpick, islandpath-dimob and sigi-hmm. using the methods and established thresholds described previously  <cit> , we identified  <dig> genomic islands  on the nrg857c chromosome ranging from  <dig> to 25-kb, with g+c content differing significantly from genome mean and with poor conservation among the other non-aiec pathotypes shown in figure  <dig> . we limited our comparative analysis here to the strains most related to nrg857c and to two well-described e. coli strains of commensal and pathogenic nature. the conservation of these  <dig> islands between nrg8578c and lf <dig> was high, suggesting that they may encode traits unique to the adherent and invasive phenotype. five of the genomic islands  code for defective prophages, three  are fimbrial islands, and three  appear to be involved in lipopolysaccharide or capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. gi- <dig> is noteworthy because it encodes an emrky-tolc multidrug resistance efflux pump and the sensor kinase, evga, involved in acid resistance and multidrug resistance in e. coli  <cit> . gi- <dig> and gi- <dig> appear to be metabolic islands involved in the transport and metabolism of various sugars. an additional six genomic islands were identified on the large plasmid  .

to date, restriction profiles or other biased analyses such as pulse field gel electrophoresis , mlst or typing for known virulence genes common to intestinal pathogenic e. coli have failed to uncover unique genetic determinants implicated in the aiec phenotype  <cit> . to begin to identify single genetic determinants unique to aiec, we carried out whole-genome comparisons between nrg857c, lf <dig>  and  <dig> other non-aiec genomes of e. coli. nrg857c and lf <dig> show considerable sequence similarity and synteny  with  <dig> chromosomal genes unique to nrg857c and  <dig> chromosomal genes unique to lf <dig> . the large plasmids from nrg857c and lf <dig> show almost no conservation between them , suggesting that they have different ancestry.

panseq, a web-based tool designed to analyse the "pan-genome" of closely-related genome sequences, was used to identify genes common to aiec strains nrg857c and lf <dig>  but absent in other members of this phylogenetic cluster . we programmed panseq to find unique sequences of at least 2-kb present in nrg857c and lf <dig> but absent in apec-o <dig>   <dig> and cft <dig>  in this analysis, we found  <dig> sequences with a combined length of 155-kb that are unique to aiec strains. several of these sequences code for prophage elements including a  <dig> -kb region encoding the morphogenesis and packaging modules of a p22-like prophage . a second interesting region of  <dig> -kb extends, with one interruption, from nrg857_ <dig> to nrg857_ <dig> and codes for several proteins involved in intermediary metabolism including transport of propanol/propanediol and galactitol. blastn analysis of this region revealed two sub-regions, one  <dig> -kb and the other  <dig> -kb, which are not found in the complete genome sequence of any other e. coli strain. the latter region shows 71% sequence coverage to a region from the complete genome of citrobacter rodentium icc <dig>  while approximately half of the longer sequence is also found in an uncharacterized e. coli strain atcc  <dig>  this  <dig> -kb region has no nucleotide similarity with any other fully sequenced bacterium. blastx revealed similarity in this region to two hypothetical vibrio coralliilyticus atcc baa- <dig> proteins  adjacent to orthologs in burkholderia cenocepacia hi <dig> , which are described as hypothetical proteins.

plasmid analysis
the 150-kb plasmid in nrg857c is different from the plasmid found in lf <dig>  whereas plasmid pnrg857c shows significant regions of identity to plasmids in other seropathotypes of e. coli, the 110-kb plasmid of strain lf <dig>  has very little similarity to pnrg857c or papec-o <dig> , pcolbm , puti <dig>  and po <dig> sakai  . the extrachromosomal plasmid in nrg857c is a antimicrobial resistance plasmid with a suite of genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, chloramphenicol, mercury, quaternary ammonium salts, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim, several of which appear to be enclosed as transposon blocks. the plasmid may be capable of conjugal transfer as it encodes several tra genes, although we have not experimentally tested this. in addition, there are genes for colicins m and v production and immunity. the antibiotic resistance genes are clustered in three regions of the plasmid in pi- <dig>  pi- <dig> and pi- <dig> . the mercury resistance cassette is identical to is <dig> found in inca/c <dig> plasmids pryc103t <dig> , plew <dig> , nr <dig>  and r <dig> . the β-lactam-macrolide region is identical to sequences present in plasmid ptz <dig>  and ptz <dig> . also of interest to us were several genes involved in siderophore production and iron metabolism. plasmid pnrg857c has the sitabcd operon that encodes proteins involved in the periplasmic and inner membrane transport of iron and manganese. two outer membrane proteins  are also encoded by the plasmid and are involved in translocation of iron across the membrane. iuta  is the ferric-aerobactin receptor, while fepa  is an iron-enterobactin outer membrane transporter, both of which are involved in the tonb-dependent transport pathway for iron and also the om receptor for the colicins  <cit> . iuta and fepa are encoded on plasmids papec-o103-colbm, papec-o1-colbm, pcvm29188_ <dig> , pvm <dig> , and plvpk . interestingly, the chromosome contains a fepa paralog . the presence of several iron-acquisition genes suggests that fur regulation of these plasmid-encoded genes occur  <cit> . as predicted, the consensus dna sequence for fur binding  is found in the upstream regulatory region,  <cit> ) of the irobcde, sitabcd, iucabcd-iuta operons, and the shif and fepa genes.

identification of other potential virulence determinants
the chromosome of aiec strain nrg857c encodes a variety of potential virulence factors . as mentioned above, the plasmid carries several potential virulence factors including genes for iron acquisition. this would suggest that the plasmid contributes to the overall virulence of this bacterium, however we have demonstrated previously that a plasmid-cured variant was still able to attach to and invade epithelial cells in vitro  <cit> .

 type vi secretion system
we identified genes for a complete type vi secretion system  that are associated with virulence in other invasive organisms   <cit> . t6ss are phage-related secretion systems found in many gram-negative pathogens and are thought to be involved in supporting an intracellular lifestyle, although their distribution is not restricted to pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the t6ss in nrg857c is found in gi- <dig>  a low gc region of the chromosome directly downstream from a trna which is a common integration site for mobile genetic elements. this t6ss island encodes the conserved core elements of the secretion apparatus, including the valine-glycine repeat protein g , the clpv atpase  and the hemolysin coregulated protein  that is 100% identical to hcp in apec-o <dig> and the upec strains ut <dig> and  <dig>  we also identified a second hcp upstream of this conserved locus  that is 100% identical to hcp in e. coli s <dig>  that causes neonatal meningitis  <cit> , suggesting that this t6ss island is a mosaic with different ancestries. other organisms, including vibrio cholerae, have two hcp genes in different parts of the genome  <cit> , which may impart different functionalities on the secretion apparatus. whether the t6ss in aiec facilitates intracellular survival and/or growth will require additional experimentation that we are currently pursuing.

 adhesins
nrg857c contains genes that are important for adhesion and invasion of aiec lf <dig>  including nlp <dig>  htra, yfgl, and dsba  <cit> . the spaan program  <cit>  as well as blastp with relaxed stringency was used to identify and extensive list of additional predicted adhesins . the majority of the fimbrial operons in nrg857c are found in other e. coli strains, with the exception of the long polar fimbriae , which might be important for tissue tropism. a second auf fimbrial system with a potential role as a colonization factor is encoded by genes nrg857_ <dig> through _ <dig>  other potential mediators of invasion include a hemagglutinin/invasin  and an ibe invasin . in previous work, the invasion of brain endothelial cells was found to be mediated by the ibe invasin, and was located on a genomic island called gima  <cit> . the presence of gima was almost exclusive to expec strains of phylogroup b <dig>  and we now show that ibe is also present in aiec, suggesting it may be involved in invasive properties of certain strains.

in mouse models of aiec-induced colitis, inflammation requires type i pili expression by the bacterial cells, as no colitis is induced by Δfimh mutant bacteria  <cit> . colitis in this model requires the expression of human ceacam receptors by transgenic mice, suggesting that the type i pili of aiec can induce a proinflammatory response via ceacam receptors in the gut mucosa. in support of this, fimh, the adhesin tip protein, is necessary but not sufficient for adhesion of aiec strain lf <dig> to intestine- <dig> cells  <cit> . polymorphisms in the fimh sequence have been identified in e. coli isolated from ibd patients and healthy individuals. in particular,  <dig> amino acid variants are associated with e. coli from ibd tissue and  <dig> variants are associated with e. coli from healthy individuals  <cit> . interestingly, fimh in nrg857c contains two disease-associated amino acid variants . whether or not these variants are associated with different inflammatory responses or subtle differences in adherence in vivo will be important areas for future work.

 transcriptional regulators of virulence genes
nrg857c contains global transcriptional regulators including phop-phoq, envz-ompr, slya and the negative regulators hns, hha, and fis involved in genome architecture and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . although these transcriptional factors are common to many bacterial species, in most gram-negative pathogens they coordinate transcription of virulence genes including secretion system, toxins, adhesins and flagellar biosynthesis machinery  <cit> . with this completed genome sequence, functional genomics approaches are now possible to understand the regulons of these transcription factors and their roles in intracellular survival and growth of aiec. indeed, fis levels in the cell have already been associated with regulating the adhesive properties of aiec strain lf <dig>  <cit> .

 iron acquisition
iron acquisition is an essential virulence trait in other expec and these systems are expressed during urinary tract infections in vivo  <cit> . since nrg875c had an abundance of iron uptake systems, we designed experiments to test the role of iron acquisition during infection. we made an aerobactin transport mutant by deletion of iuta and tested whether this iron transport system was important for intracellular survival and the ability to colonize animals. we found that the iuta mutant was able to synthesize but not transport aerobactin . to investigate the invasive properties of Δiuta, we conducted standard gentamicin protection assays in j <dig>  macrophage cells, which did not reveal a significant difference in the uptake at  <dig> h of the wild type and the iuta mutant . however, by  <dig> h after infection and thereafter, the iuta mutant had a significant defect in intracellular survival and/or replication compared to wild type cells. to determine whether the transport of aerobactin was important for bacterial infection in vivo, streptomycin pre-treated mice were infected with wild type nrg857c and the isogenic iuta mutant as described previously for a salmonella infection model  <cit> . wild type nrg857c was recovered in ~50-fold more abundance in the intestinal tissue compared to Δiuta .

CONCLUSIONS
the two broad hypotheses accounting for the immunopathology of ibd, including deregulation of the intestinal immune system, and dysbiosis of the commensal microbiota  <cit> , are likely not mutually exclusive. both pathways could be operationalized at the same time and in response to known genetic and environmental triggers. regarding the genetic correlates of the aiec phenotype, our genome sequence and comparative analyses provide many testable hypotheses to uncover the adhesive, invasive, and proinflammatory nature of aiec. the fact that the  <dig> genomic islands in nrg857c are, in many cases, highly orthologous in lf <dig> but weakly conserved or absent in other e. coli pathotypes and commensal organisms is suggestive that these genomic islands may have an influential role in the expression of the aiec phenotype. it is also likely that evolved differences in gene expression, or regulatory evolution, has played a pivotal role in generating phenotypic diversity involved in pathogen-like behaviour of aiec, as we have shown previously for another intracellular pathogen  <cit> . functional genomics studies enabled by this work will be forthcoming.
