BACKGROUND
micrornas , a class of 21–24 nt small rnas, have important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants  <cit> . the precursors of mirna genes have imperfect stem-loop structures and are further processed into mirna-mirna* by rnaiii-like nucleases. one strand of the duplex is associated with a member of the argonaute  family. the resulting mirna-ago complex is the mirna-induced silencing complex, which interacts with the complementary site of target mrna transcript, thereby repressing the expression of the target transcripts at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> .

the recently developed next-generation sequencing technology has provided a rapid and high-throughput tool to explore the large inventory of small rna  populations  <cit> . to date, a large number of mirnas have been identified in diverse plant species . the june  <dig> release of mirbase  <dig> contains over  <dig>  distinct mature mirna sequences  <cit> . many of the mirnas are conserved in plants, while a large number of mirnas show species specificity. the appearance in the database of large numbers of species-specific mirnas  suggests that mirnas are born frequently but are also lost frequently, and the foldback sequences in genomes, inverted duplication events, and transposable elements, are thought to be important sources of many new mirnas  <cit> .

genome-wide surveys of mirna and mirna binding site polymorphisms have been conducted widely in animals and human. these studies have shown that polymorphisms in mirnas and their targets are less than in neutral regions. further, the mutations at the mirna and target sites exhibit a general signature of purifying selection  <cit> . although, the polymorphisms of mirna and mirna binding site are low, several mutations can be detected in these loci, which may cause the change of mirna targets. in animal and humans, many studies have reported that snps or indels in mirna-related loci can change the mrna targets of mirna  <cit> . for example,  <dig> snps were identified in human mirna seed regions and thousands of snps in the 3’ untranslated regions have the potential to either disturb or create mirna-target interactions  <cit> .

in plants, there were some reports on the mirna and mirna binding site polymorphisms in arabidopsis and rice. these studied have proved that, like in animal and humans, both mirnas and their target binding sites have low nucleotide variation and divergence compared to their flanking sequences, indicating strong purifying selection on these sites  <cit> . in plants, mirna target recognition is highly dependent on interactions between complementary sequences in the mirnas and their target sites in mrnas   <cit> . therefore, mirna targeting and function can be affected by sequence polymorphisms in mirna-target pair sites. in rice,  <dig> mutation sites were observed in the mature sequences of  <dig> mirnas, and the snps in mir <dig> cause the production of new mirna targets  <cit> . although, these studies have shown how snps in mirna-target pair sites affect mirna targeting and function, there is still absent systematically studies on how snp have impacts on mirna-targets changes in plant.

in this study, we performed the deep sequencing of cucumber mirna, and used re-sequence data to assess the variation of mirna-related loci in cucumber. our results showed that snps can alter mirna function and cause unique mirna targets for domestic and wild cucumbers. therefore, mirna-related snps could be an important factor that leads to the agronomic differences between domestic and wild cucumbers.

RESULTS
construction and sequencing of small rna libraries
we constructed root, stem, and leaf-derived small rna  libraries for cucumber line  <dig> and line hardwickii, respectively. for each library, on average more than  <dig> million clean reads and more than  <dig>  million unique reads were obtained . we mapped the unique reads to the corresponding line  <dig> and hardwickii genomes. averagely, more than  <dig>  million of the non-redundant unique reads in each library had at least one perfect match to the cucumber genome, and were analyzed further. the size distribution of all the srna reads is summarized in fig.  <dig>  the cucumber srnas varied in length from  <dig> to 30 nt, and the majority were in the 20–24 nt range. the 24-nt long reads were the most abundant, followed by the 21-nt long reads, which is consistent with the findings in other plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice and soybean.table  <dig> statistics of short rna sequences from the cucumber leaves, stems, and roots

identification of conserved and known mirnas in cucumber
conserved mirna families have been found in many plant species and have been shown to have important functions in plant development and stress response  <cit> . we used the mirbase  <dig> database as a reference to identify conserved mirnas in the six cucumber srna libraries. the reads with two or fewer mismatches to sequences in mirbase  <dig> were considered as candidate conserved mirna. these candidate mirnas were subjected to a rigorous secondary structure analysis using the mireap software to predict their secondary structure  <cit> . totally, we identified  <dig> conserved mirnas families with canonical stem-loop structure . we refer to these srnas as conserved mirnas in this study. we calculated the expression levels of conserved mirna families based on rmp  values . some of the conserved families were similarly high  or low  in all three tissues; however, some conserved mirnas were more abundant in some tissues than in others. for example, mir <dig> expression in the root was more than three times its expression in stem and leaf. we also found some differences in mirna expression patterns between  <dig> and hardwickii. for example, in  <dig>  mir <dig> expression was higher in leaf than in stem and root, while, in hardwickii, the mir <dig> expression was low in all three tissues .table  <dig> the abundance of conserved and known mirnas family in cucumber tissues

in addition to the conserved mirnas, there were other mirnas that are not conserved, but that are found in only a few plant species. we refer to these less-conserved but known mirna as known mirnas in this study. a total of nine known mirna families were identified in the six libraries . most of the known mirnas exhibited relatively low expression; however, a notable exception was mir <dig>  which was expressed at an abundance of more than  <dig>  reads per million  in all three tissues tested. some of the known mirnas displayed tissue-specific expression. for example, mir <dig> expression was detected in the stem and leaf, but not in the root.

cucumber-specific mirnas
after excluding the srna reads that were homologous to the conserved and known mirnas, the remaining srnas with a maximum of  <dig> matches in the genome were subjected to rigorous secondary structure analysis of their precursors according to the criteria established by meyers  <cit> . a total of  <dig> mirna candidates contained stem-loop structure and met the screening criteria, and, for  <dig> of them, a mirna star  sequence was identified in the same library. we considered the  <dig> mirnas with mirna* sequences as new cucumbers-specific mirnas and the remaining  <dig> without mirna* sequences as candidate cucumber-specific mirna; collectively, we termed them cucumber-specific mirnas .

to verify the existence and expression of the mirnas identified in this study, we used real-time rt-pcr analysis to detect their relative expression pattern in root, stem and leaf between  <dig> and hardwickii . the relative expression levels of  <dig> selected conserved, known mirnas and  <dig> cucumber-specific mirnas were analyzed. the results showed that the conserved and known mirna showed fewer expression differences between  <dig> and hardwickii than the cucumber-specific mirnas .

snps and nucleotide divergence in cucumber mirnas
in this study, we used the cucumber resequencing data to assess genome-wide patterns of nucleotide diversity for the cucumber mirnas. a whole-genome snp analysis, with the parameter π , was used to identify nucleotide diversity in the loci of the mirna genes. the average π values of the conserved mirna and cucumber-specific mirna genes loci were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> respectively , which is significantly lower  than the π value of the cucumber genome , indicating that the mirna loci are more conserved than the cucumber genome as a whole. we also analyzed the nucleotide diversity of mirna-related loci, including mirna mature sequences loci, mirna gene loci , mirna flanking regions  and mirna-target binding sites. as expected, the highest nucleotide diversity was observed for the mirna flanking regions, followed by the mirna gene loci. except for the mirna flanking regions, other mirna-related loci showed significantly low sequence diversity compare to cucumber genome . notable, the nucleotide diversity of mirna-target interaction sites, including mirna mature sequences and mirna-target binding sites was much lower than that of mirna gene loci, indicating that these loci were much conserved in the evolution.fig.  <dig> the nucleotide diversity of mirna-related loci in cucumber. the average pairwise nucleotide diversity  is used to analyzed the nucleotide diversity of cucumber mirna-related loci. x-axis is represented different mirna-related loci 




mirna target alteration by snps in mirna mature sequences
in plant, microrna target recognition is highly dependent on sequence complementarity between mirna mature sequences and their target. therefore, mirna targeting and function can be affected by polymorphisms in those sequences. we first used cucumber resequencing data to identify the snps in cucumber mirna mature sequences. totally, for conserved and known mirna, only four mirna mature sequences, mir164a, mir166b, mir399b and mir396d were actually found to be polymorphic . compared with conserved and known mirnas, we detected more snps in cucumber-specific mirna mature sequences, with  <dig> snps for  <dig> cucumber-specific mirnas . to analyze the effects of snp on mirnas function, we constructed snp-mirnas corresponding to their cognate mirnas according to resequencing data. two mirna target finding software, mentioned in our material and methods, were used to predict targets for the both snp-mirnas and their cognate mirnas. our results showed that snp-mirnas could interact with a total of  <dig> new targets compared with the cognate mirnas , with snp-mirnas 396d having the maximum number  new targets. finding of lots of new targets for snp-mirnas suggest that snps in mature sequences could cause mirna to obtain new functions.table  <dig> the snps within mirna mature sequences and their frequencies

it was noted that mir164a snp showed a significant difference between china-group and india-group cucumber. in india-group cucumber, all accessions have the same base  in the 14th base from 5’ end of mirna164a, whereas about half of china-group cucumber  has base g in the locus . the snp-mir <dig> sequence was detected in  <dig> srna libraries. we used degradome data to confirm the targets for mirna <dig> and snp-mir <dig>  as showed in fig. 3a, we identified five targets of mirna <dig>  and all five of these mrnas encoded members of the nam  protein family. it should be noted that snp-mir <dig> had a unique target named csnam <dig>  that also belongs to the nam protein family, indicating that the snp cause mirna164a to obtain a new target. the cleavage site of snp-mir <dig> was at 663 bp from 5’-end of csnam <dig>  which corresponding to our degradome data . however, no statistic significantly cleavage site for evm.model.chr <dig> , the orthologous genes of csnam <dig> in line hardwickii, can be detected , indicating that mir <dig> is unlikely to cleave evm.model.chr <dig> . the expression levels of csnam <dig> detected by real-time pcr were lower than that of evm.model.chr <dig>  in all tissues tested , suggesting that csnam <dig> expression was repressed by snp-mir <dig>  nam proteins are plant-specific transcription factors involved in development processes, such as formation of the shoot apical meristem and lateral shoots. the ability of snp-mir <dig> to target a unique nam gene suggests that a new regulatory role for mirna <dig> in domestic cucumber development.fig.  <dig> the targets analysis for mir <dig> and snp-mir <dig> in domestic cucumber. a. predicted targets for mir <dig> and snp-mir <dig>  the short vertical bars represent match base pair and two vertical dots representing a g-u pair. b. a schematic figure represents the interaction between snp-mirna164a and it’s predicted target csnam <dig>  thick black line represents mrna of csnam <dig>  number on the black line represents cleavage site within mrna, which also was represented by the red arrow. the snp-mirna <dig> and the target mrna are showed in the expanded regions. the number in the parentheses represents the number of sequenced 5’ race clones corresponding to each site. c. target plots of snp-mirna <dig> target csnam <dig> confirmed by degradome sequencing. the black dots represent degrade tags from degradome sequencing. the red dot represents the most abundant cleavage tag derived from mirna cleavage site. d. the expression of csnam <dig> revealed by real-time pcr. β-actin was used as an internal control to normalize the data. for compare analysis, we set expression of csnam <dig> in line  <dig> root as control. e. target plots of snp-mirna <dig> target csnam <dig> confirmed by degradome sequencing. the black dots represent degrade tags from degradome sequencing. the red dot represents the most abundant cleavage tag derived from mirna cleavage site. f. the expression of evm.tu.chr <dig> , which is an orthologous gene of csnam <dig> in line hardwickii, compared with expression of csnam <dig> in line  <dig> roots




mirna target alteration by snps in mirna-target binding sites
we used  <dig> mrna genes to predict targets for cucumber mirnas, and found a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mrnas that could be the candidate targets for the conserved and cucumber-specific mirna, respectively . we identified the snps at mirna-mrna binding sites by using the resequencing data. we detected a total of  <dig> and  <dig> snps in the mirna-target binding sites of conserved and cucumber-specific mirna, respectively , suggesting these snps could affect mirna-target binding. to analyze the influence of snps in mirna-target binding sites on mirna/target interactions, we focused on the snps differences of mirna-target loci between  <dig> and hardwickii. we detected  <dig> mirna-target binding sites snps between  <dig> and hardwickii for conserved and known mirna, and  <dig> for cucumber-specific mirnas . to confirm whether those snps be functional snps, according to snps at mirna-target binding sites and  <dig> mrna sequences, we reconstructed snp-mrna sequences corresponding to their cognate mrna in  <dig>  and we also used two kinds of softwares to find mirna targets in snp-mrna sequences. in addition, to confirm the reconstructed snp-mrna sequences being derived from hardwickii mrna, we used the snp-mrna sequences blast to hardiwkki annotated mrna. those snp-mrna sequences were considered as potential hariwikki mrnas, if they satisfied the following strict criteria:  the similarity between the snp-mrna sequences and hardwickii mrnas is higher than 90%  the corresponding hardwickii mrna must contain predicted mirna-mrna binds sites of snp-mrna. we referred to these snp-mrna sequences as hariwikki mrnas. we compared the target differences between  <dig> mrna and hardiwkikki mrna, for conserved and known mirna, we found that the mirna-mrna binds sites snps between  <dig> and hardwickii disrupted  <dig> mirna-mrna complementary binding sites in  <dig>  and created  <dig> new potential target binding sites in hardwickii, which potentially creating  <dig> 9930-unique and  <dig> hardwickii-unique mirna targets . for cucumber-specific mirna, we detected  <dig> 9930-unique and  <dig> hardwickii-unique target mirnas .

experimentally confirm mirna target alteration by snps in mirna-mrna binding sites
we further used experimental methods, including degradome analysis, 5’race and realtime pcr, to confirm these unique mirna targets. as showed in fig.  <dig>  the degradome data of line  <dig> indicated that mirna159c has a cleavage site at 333 bp within mrna of csa5m <dig> , and this target can be classed into category  <dig> as a result of the most abundant cleavage tags can be detected at the cleavage site, according to category criteria established by cleaveland  <dig> . however, by analyzing the degradome data of line hardwickii, we failed to found a statistical significant cleavage site for hardwickii gene evm.model.chr <dig> , which is a high similar  orthologous gene for csa5m <dig> . a nucleotide difference between csa5m <dig>  and evm.model.chr <dig>  can be detected at 331th bp site of csa5m <dig>  , and our degradome results suggested that this snp is likely to affect mirna-mrna binding by disrupting the base pair between mirna159c and its target. we further employed 5’race to verify the cleavage site within csa5m <dig>  by using a gene-specific primer designed at 792 bp site of csa5m <dig> , and we obtained a 484 bp band , which were consistent with our degradome sequencing data. by comparing expression levels of csa5m <dig>  and evm.model.chr <dig>  in different tissues, we found that the expression levels of csa5m <dig>  were lower than those of evm.model.chr <dig>  , indicating that mirna159c inhibit the expression of csa5m <dig>  but not for evm.model.chr <dig> . together, our experiments confirmed mirna159c can cleavage csa5m <dig>  but not for evm.model.chr <dig> .fig.  <dig> experimentally confirm snps-causing 9930-unique target csa5m <dig> .

totally, we experimentally verified six 9930-unique targets and nine hardwickii-unique targets for conserved cucumber mirna , including some members of transcriptional factor such as gras, f-box and so on, suggesting that these 9930-unique or hardwickii-unique targets could play roles in various differences between domestic and wild cucumbers. our real-time pcr analysis showed that most of unique targets expressions were inhibited by mirna compared to their corresponding orthologus genes that were no more than the targets for the mirna .table  <dig> snps-causing 9930-unique targets and hardwickii-unique targets confirmed by experiments

discussion
cucumber mirnas and their genetic diversity
in this study, we identified a total of  <dig> conserved and less-conserved mirnas , which the nomenclature of cucumber mirna was obtained according to the criterion of mirna research  <cit> . compared with the results of previous study in cucumber mirna  <cit> , there were some differences in our results. for example, we identified five new conserved or less-conserved mirnas  in cucumber that were not detected in the studies in previous study. the different results may be partly explained by differences between the tissue-derived srna libraries that were used. the libraries used in the martinez’s study were derived from phloem and leaves of cucumber, and the libraries used in the mao et al. study were derived from leaves and roots. in our study, the libraries were derived from the stem, leaf and root. it is likely that the different mirnas will have different expression levels in the various tissues and, therefore, some mirnas may be detected in one tissue, but not in other tissues. we also identified  <dig> new mirnas in this study and each of these  <dig> new mirnas was predicted to have a canonical stem-loop structure. in the previous two studies, a total of nine new cucumber mirna were identified  <cit> . mao et al. identified two new cucumber mirnas, csa-mirn1-5p, which corresponds to our csa-mir <dig>  and mirn2-5p, which corresponds to our csa-mir <dig>  martinez et al. identified six new cucumber mirnas, including csa-mir <dig>  which corresponds to our csa-mir <dig>  and csa-mir <dig>  due to many new mirna derived from repeat regions, therefore, the prediction result for new mirnas also variable  <cit> .

qi et al. reported that genome-wide nucleotide diversity of domestic cucumbers was significantly lower in domestic cucumbers compared with wild cucumbers  <cit> , and our analysis of between the domestic and wild cucumber libraries confirmed this earlier finding. our results showed that domestic selection had reduced the genetic diversity of mirna loci compared with the genetic diversity of mirna loci in wild cucumber. although, the nucleotide diversity of domestic cucumbers is significantly lower than that of wild cucumbers, the domestic cucumbers have group-specific snps. for example, our results indicated that the 9930-specific snps occurred at the 14th base in the mature mir164a sequence. our study also showed that the snp could produce new mrna targets for mir164a. these results indicated that some variations have been fixed in cucumber mirna loci by domestic selection  however, how mir164a regulates the expression of its target genes is still unknown.

snps play an important role in the expressions of mirna and their targets
mirnas regulate plant growth and development, and respond to various stresses through negative, post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of their target genes . at the same time, mirnas expression is also regulated in tissue-specific, developmental-specific and stresses-induced manner. for example, our results indicated that even several conserved mirna showed a differential expression in different tissues. we also found some differences in the mirna expression patterns between  <dig> and hardwickii. for example, the expression of mir <dig> in  <dig> showed an obvious difference compared with in hardwickii, suggesting that the abundance of several mirnas of closely related cucurbit species was also distinctly different, which is similar with previous report  <cit> .

snps in mirna seed regions and translated regions have potential to change the mirna expression. several snps in human mirna seed regions and untranslated regions are supposed to have the ability to change mirna expression  <cit> . snps in the mature sequences of  <dig> rice mirna have possible impacts on the mirna expression  <cit> . mirnas, like protein-coding genes, have their own promoter region. the snps in promoter region of protein-coding can change the gene expression. therefore, the snps in promoter region of mirna could also change mirnas expression. many evidences suggest that snps in human mirna genes promoter can alter the expression of mirna  <cit> . we next will investigate the association between the snps and mirna expression in cucumber.

the genetic diversity, including snp and indel, within mirna-targets interaction sites can affect the recognition and binding between mirnas and their targets. in this study, we found a total of  <dig> snps within mature sequences and  <dig> snps within binding sites, suggesting the snps could impact mirna-targets binding. we experimentally confirmed that the snps disturbed or created mirna-binding that cause to 9930-unique or hardwickii-unique targets. on the other hands, we found that most of snps within mirna-targets interaction sites had no influence on the binding despite of these snps have decreased or increased the complementarity between mirna and targets. so a question rose. what degrees of complementarity within mirna-targets interaction sites decided the reorganization between mirnas and their targets, or decided the transcriptional repression and transcriptional cleavage. in animal, the complementarity between 6 bp seeds region of mirnas and their binding sites are required for the recognition. the snps or indels outside of the seeds regions have little impact on bindings, while within the seeds regions the snps and indels will exclusively alter mirna targets. whether is there seeds regions within plant mirna mature sequences? more studies on how mirnas interact with their targets should be carried on.

snps associated with important agronomic trait in cucumber
cultivated and wild cucumbers show significant differences in various agronomic traits. most of these agronomic traits are regulated by mirnas such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and many transcriptional factors are the targets of mirnas. mirnas have an important regulatory function in plant development and, therefore, may have important roles in regulation pathways that contribute to the significant differences in various agronomic traits between cultivated and wild cucumbers. in our study, based on a genome-wide degradome analysis, we identified many 9930-unique and hardwickii-unique target mrnas of cucumber. some of the unique targets were the members of transcriptional factor. for example, nam proteins are plant-specific transcription factors involved in development processes, such as formation of the shoot apical meristem and lateral shoots. in our study, one of nam protein  is the target of snp-mir <dig>  and this result was found only in domestic cucumbers. interestingly, nam protein family is also underwent domestic selection in domestic cucumber. our results suggest that the changes in mirna targets would have resulted from domestic selection.

to verify whether the mirna-related snps have agronomic importance, we perform gwas analysis for this snps. cucumber fruit length  showed an obvious difference between  <dig> and hardwickii, which is a typical agronomic trait of domestic selection. we found a snp  occurred in the mirna-target interaction sites of mirna <dig> and its target csa3m <dig>  shows a significant association with fl . it was noted that the snp <dig> located in a selective sweep region of chromosome  <dig> which is associated with fl. therefore, our study suggests that the mirna-related snps could have important impact to crop agronomic traits.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> conserved mirna families, nine less-conserved mirna families, and  <dig> cucumber-specific mirnas in cucumber genome. using cucumber resequencing data,  <dig> snps in mirna mature sequences and  <dig> snps in mirna-target binding sites were identified. we found that snps can alter mirna function and cause unique mirna targets for domestic and wild cucumbers, which leads to the agronomic differences between domestic and wild cucumber.
