BACKGROUND
cucumber  is an economically important crop, with an annual global production of over  <dig> megatons  <cit> . powdery mildew  is one of the most widespread diseases in cucurbits, and a limiting factor for cucumber production. two species of fungi have been reported to cause pm in cucumber, i.e., podosphaera xanthii  and golovinomyces cichoracearum . of these, p. xanthii is considered to be the main causal agent of pm in cucurbits  <cit> .

breeding of resistant cucumber varieties has been undertaken for several decennia , but underlying resistance genes have to date not been functionally characterised. as the genome of cucumber  was published in  <dig>  <cit> , and several other cucumber accessions have been resequenced  <cit> , the time is now ripe to identify causal genes for cucumber resistance to mildew diseases.

traditionally, breeding of disease resistant crops is performed by introgression of resistance  genes, often from wild relatives of the crop. r proteins, most commonly of the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich-repeat  type, are able to recognise either corresponding avirulence  gene products of the pathogen, or degradation products of host factors associated with pathogen attack  <cit> . this triggers a defence response in the host cell, often associated with a hypersensitive response , leading to cell death  <cit> . as r genes recognise very specific products, introgression and subsequent employment of a new r gene puts selective pressure on the pathogen to evolve in such a way that it is no longer recognised by the host plant. therefore, r-gene based resistance is often breached by new, virulent, races of the pathogen quite soon, especially for versatile pathogens, such as powdery mildew fungi  <cit> .

an alternative for r-gene mediated resistance is the identification of impaired susceptibility  genes  <cit> . most pathogens require cooperation of their host plant to be able to successfully establish a compatible interaction  <cit> . this is especially true for biotrophic pathogens such as mildew species, as they greatly rely on a long-lasting interaction with  host cells to facilitate their propagation  <cit> . therefore, the expression of several host genes is essential for the pathogen. such genes can be regarded as s genes, and can function for instance in facilitating host recognition and penetration, negative regulation of host defences or fulfilling metabolic and structural needs of the pathogen  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in a s gene are thought to lead to durable, broad spectrum, recessively inherited resistance  <cit> .

the barley mlo gene is one of the best-known examples of an impaired s gene. after it first was found in the 1940s in a mutagenized barley population  <cit> , deployment of loss-of-function mlo alleles in barley has resulted in pm resistant barley varieties. these have been grown in the field for several decades already without breaching of resistance by virulent new mildew races to date, providing evidence for the durability of s-gene based resistance  <cit> . after the barley mlo gene was cloned  <cit> , it was found that mlo genes are conserved throughout the plant kingdom and occur in higher plants as a multi-copy gene family  <cit> . in several plant species, mlo-like genes have been found to be involved in pm susceptibility, such as arabidopsis, tomato, pea, pepper, tobacco, bread wheat and potentially also grapevine and peach . it has been found that in phylogenetic trees of the mlo gene family all mlo-like s-genes for pm detected in monocotyledonous species cluster in clade iv, whereas all mlo-like s-genes identified in dicotyledonous species cluster in clade v. the other clades  harbour mlo-like genes that have not been proven to be s-genes  <cit> .

the genome of cucumber harbours  <dig> putative mlo-like genes  <cit> . of these, three  cluster in clade v of the mlo gene family, and can therefore be considered candidate s-genes for powdery mildew resistance  <cit> . csamlo <dig> is of particular interest, as its position on the genome  co-localizes with pm <dig> , a recently identified major qtl explaining  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation for ‘hypocotyl’ resistance in f <dig> families derived from the resistant cucumber inbred line wi  <dig>  <cit> . ‘hypocotyl’ or intermediate resistance of cucumber to pm was previously shown to be a recessively inherited monogenic trait in crossings between several cucumber lines, and was characterised by completely resistant hypocotyl, stem and petiole tissue and partially resistant leaves and cotyledons. hypocotyl resistance is suggested to play an important role in overall pm resistance of cucumber, as it appears that complete resistance in leaves is not possible without the recessive hypocotyl resistance gene  <cit> . in breeding practice loss of the hypocotyl resistance allele leads to pm susceptible seedlings. the allele is present in almost all modern pickling cucumber varieties, and most of the resistant long cucumber varieties , showing the agricultural significance of hypocotyl resistance in cucumber.

here, we report the cloning of csamlo <dig> from both susceptible and  resistant cucumber genotypes. we show that at the transcript level the allele obtained from the resistant genotype has deletions of  <dig> or 174 bp due to alternative splicing, caused by the insertion of a ltr retrotransposable element in this gene at the genomic level. complementation of the tomato mlo-mutant with the wild-type and ∆ <dig> alleles of csamlo <dig> showed that wild-type csamlo <dig> is a functional susceptibility gene , whereas the ∆ <dig> allele has lost its function as s-gene, thus leading to pm resistance. furthermore, qrt-pcr showed that csamlo <dig> is transcriptionally upregulated upon inoculation with p. xanthii in hypocotyl tissue, but not in leaves or cotyledon, explaining why loss-of-function of csamlo <dig> provides particularly resistance in the hypocotyl.

RESULTS
cloning and sequencing of the csamlo <dig> coding sequence from susceptible and resistant genotypes
we performed rt-pcr using rna derived from either a susceptible wild-type cucumber cultivar or a resistant breeding line known to be homozygous for the hypocotyl resistance qtl as a template. whereas the product we obtained from the susceptible genotype was of the expected size , we obtained two different products from the resistant genotype, both smaller than expected . sequence analysis revealed that the csamlo <dig> mrna variant obtained from the susceptible genotype was identical to the predicted coding sequence. the two mrna products obtained from the resistant genotype however had  deletions of respectively  <dig> and 174 bp. the 174 bp deletion variant corresponds to a loss of the complete 11th exon of the csamlo <dig> gene, whereas the 72 bp deletion variant corresponds to the loss of a fragment of the 11th exon with canonical splice sites  . furthermore, the coding sequence of the resistant genotype has five  snps compared to the reference genome .fig.  <dig> characterization of csamlo <dig> alleles from resistant and susceptible cucumber genotypes. a cdna of resistant  and susceptible  cucumber genotypes was used as template for pcr with csamlo <dig> specific primers. amplified products were analysed on  <dig>  % agarose gels. whereas the product amplified from cdna of the susceptible genotype gives a single band of the expected size, cdna of the resistant genotype results in two separate bands, both of a smaller size than expected. b full length csamlo <dig> amplified from cdna from susceptible and resistant cucumber genotypes was sequenced. a partial alignment is shown between the  sequence as obtained from the susceptible genotype and the sequences from two deletion variants  obtained from the resistant genotype. numbers are relative to the start of the alignment. c partial alignment of the csamlo <dig> protein and other proteins encoded by clade v mlo s-genes of several species. amino acid residues are coloured according to the rasmol colour scheme. the  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues deleted in the proteins encoded by the ∆ <dig> and the ∆ <dig> variants of csamlo <dig> are indicated by red arrows. a bar graph underneath the alignment indicates the conservedness of each amino acid position. d graphic representation of the transmembrane structure of the predicted csamlo <dig> protein, determined using hmmtop  <dig>   <cit> . the plasma membrane is indicated by two horizontal lines. amino acid residues highlighted in black are predicted to be deleted in the protein encoded by the ∆ <dig> variant of the csamlo <dig> gene, residues highlighted in black and grey are predicted to be deleted in the protein encoded by the ∆ <dig> variant of the csamlo <dig> gene



to determine the impact of the  <dig> and 174 bp deletions found in the mrna on the predicted csamlo <dig> protein sequence, the predicted csamlo <dig> protein was aligned to a dataset of mlo proteins encoded by clade v s-genes from several other species i.e., arabidopsis, barrel clover, pea, lotus, tomato, pepper and tobacco . it appeared that the region encoded by the deleted area in the  <dig> and 174 bp deletion variants is highly conserved among different mlo proteins . furthermore, the transmembrane structure of the csamlo <dig> protein  was predicted using hmmtop  <dig>  software  <cit> . the predicted transmembrane structure of the wild-type protein was largely consistent with the barley mlo structure determined by devoto et al.  <cit> . the  <dig> and 174 bp deletions correspond to removal of a region of  <dig> respectively  <dig> amino acid residues in the  third cytoplasmic loop of csamlo <dig> .

the relative transcript abundances of the two csamlo <dig> splice variants characterised by the  <dig> and 174 bp deletions were determined by qrt-pcr using splice junction spanning primers on different tissues  of pm resistant cucumber, either inoculated with pm or non-inoculated. it appeared that the 174 bp deletion splice variant was the most abundant isoform, whereas the 72 bp deletion splice variant was less abundant in each tissue regardless whether tissues were inoculated or not .

complementation of slmlo <dig> loss-of-function tomato mutant with csamlo <dig> wt and csamlo8∆174
the sequence analysis of the transcripts of csamlo <dig> from susceptible and resistant genotypes led to the hypothesis that csamlo <dig> is a functional s-gene for pm, whereas the 174 bp deletion allele  has lost its function as s-gene. to test these hypotheses, both alleles were overexpressed in a previously described tomato mlo-mutant, which carries a mutation in the tomato slmlo <dig> gene and is resistant to tomato powdery mildew, oidium neolycopersici  <cit> .

cuttings of ten independent transgenic individuals per construct  were challenged with the tomato pm pathogen o. neolycopersici. powdery mildew susceptibility was evaluated qualitatively, by looking for pm symptoms on the leaves . six out of ten individual transformants expressing csamlo <dig> wt were scored as susceptible to pm, whereas none of the transformants expressing csamlo8∆ <dig> were scored as susceptible to pm. pm susceptibility was confirmed quantitatively, by performing qpcr on dna isolated from inoculated leaves, using o. neolycopersici specific primers. this showed that the biomass of o. neolycopersici in plants scored as susceptible to pm was at least  <dig> , relative to the biomass in the susceptible control mm, whereas the biomass in plants scored as resistant was less than  <dig>  . furthermore, transcript abundances of the transgenes in each of the transgenic individuals were determined by qrt-pcr using csamlo <dig> specific primers . this confirmed that transcript levels of csamlo <dig> wt and csamlo8∆ <dig> were comparable. the six csamlo <dig> wt transformants scored as susceptible to pm had a higher csamlo <dig> expression than the four csamlo <dig> wt transformants scored as resistant to pm.fig.  <dig> complementation of ol- <dig> tomato with csamlo <dig> wt restores pm susceptibility, whereas complementation with csamlo8∆ <dig> does not. the pm resistant ol- <dig> tomato mutant with a deletion in slmlo <dig>  <cit>  was transformed with either a 35s::csamlo <dig> wt construct, a 35s::csamlo8∆ <dig> construct, or an empty vector  control. cuttings from these transformants were inoculated with a oidium neolycopersici spore suspension. as additional control we used the wild-type, susceptible cv. moneymaker . a the phenotype of susceptible control mm, resistant ev transformed ol- <dig>  and transgenic individuals overexpressing either csamlo <dig> wt or csamlo8∆ <dig> in ol- <dig> background. photographs were taken 16 days post inoculation. b relative quantification by qpcr of the ratio between oidium neolycopersici and plant gdna in susceptible mm, resistant ev transformed ol- <dig>  and transgenic individuals overexpressing either csamlo <dig> wt or csamlo8∆ <dig> in ol- <dig> background. fold changes were normalised relative to the susceptible control mm. bars represent the average fold change over  <dig> technical replicates. error bars indicate standard deviation. asterisks indicate plants scored as susceptible to powdery mildew based on macroscopic evaluation. c relative quantification by qrt-pcr of the ratio between csamlo <dig> expression and expression of tomato housekeeping gene slef-α in ev transformed ol- <dig> and transgenic individuals overexpressing either csamlo <dig> wt or csamlo8∆ <dig> in ol- <dig> background. bars represent the average fold change over  <dig> technical replicates. error bars indicate standard deviation. asterisks indicate plants scored as susceptible to powdery mildew based on macroscopic evaluation



sequencing and characterization of a transposable element in csamlo8
to investigate the cause of the deletions in the csamlo <dig> coding sequence, we performed pcr using dna from both the susceptible and resistant cucumber genotypes as a template, with primers designed to amplify the region that contained the deletions in csamlo <dig>  the product amplified from the susceptible genotype had the expected size , whereas the product amplified from the resistant genotype was larger . sequence analysis of the amplified product revealed a 1449 bp insertion in the genomic dna sequence of the resistant genotype compared to the susceptible genotype. this insertion in the dna of the resistant genotype coincided with the region that contained the deletion in the csamlo <dig> mrna of this genotype. characterization of this genomic insertion by a dot-plot  revealed the presence of long terminal repeats  with a length of ca. 200 bp. an alignment between the first and last 200 bp of the insertion confirmed the presence of 184 bp long ltrs beginning with a 5′-tg-3′ and ending with a 5′-ta-3′ . the ltrs share 100 % sequence identity with one another. after the 3′ ltr, there is a duplication of the 5 bp of csamlo <dig> before the insertion . no open reading frames  could be detected in the insertion. taken together, these findings led us to the conclusion that the insert is most likely a non-autonomous transposable element  of class i, order ltr, according to the transposable element classification scheme proposed by wicker et al.  <cit> .fig.  <dig> amplification and sequencing of csamlo <dig> from genomic dna isolated from the resistant genotype reveals the insertion of an 1449 bp long transposable element . a the genomic region of csamlo <dig> in which deletions in the coding sequence were observed in the resistant genotype was amplified from dna isolated from both the susceptible and resistant genotypes. amplified products were analysed on  <dig>  % agarose gel. whereas the product amplified from the susceptible genotype was of the expected size, the product amplified from the resistant genotype was larger than expected. b the product amplified from the resistant genotype as described in  was sequenced, which revealed an insertion with a length of 1449 bp. a dot-plot was made of the insertion to see whether the sequence contains repetitive elements. c the first and last 200 bp of the insertion, plus 15 bp of csamlo <dig> before and after the insertion were aligned to one another, to verify the presence of long terminal repeats . non-aligned parts of the sequence are highlighted in red. it can be seen that the first 184 bp of the insertion are completely identical to the last 184 bp of the insertion. there is a duplication of 5 bp from csamlo <dig> before and after the insertion . d schematic representation of the insertion. the locations of ltrs and the 3′ tsd are indicated



similar tes in the cucumber genome
in an attempt to identify homologous, potentially autonomous, transposable elements in the cucumber genome, we performed a blastn search on the cucumber reference genome  with the ltr sequence of the te found in csamlo <dig> as query. we identified  <dig> putative homologous ltrs. a previously designed tool  <cit>  was used to screen the genome for regions bordered by two putative homologous ltr sequences. two putative homologous ltr sequences within a window of 20 kb were considered to be the borders of a putative homologous te. the 20 kb window was decided upon based on the observation that ltr retrotransposons are generally between  <dig> and 15 kb of size  <cit> , the only exception to our knowledge being the very large ogre retrotransposons found in legumes  <cit> , which have ca. 5 kb ltrs and are therefore ca. 22 kb in size. a total of  <dig> putative tes was identified, randomly distributed over all seven chromosomes of the cucumber reference genome . for  <dig> putative tes, the complete sequence in between the ltrs was extracted from the genome, and compared to the sequence of the te found in csamlo <dig> . it was found that most of the putative tes have a length comparable to the csamlo8-te, being between  <dig> and 2 kb. one putative te was considerably larger than average, with 7142 bp, whereas one putative te was considerably smaller than average, i.e., 367 bp. in only one out of the  <dig> putative tes , an open reading frame  could be detected. this orf, with a length of 411 bp, does not lead to a predicted protein with any similarity to known proteins according to a blastp search against all non-redundant protein databases, and is therefore considered a false positive orf. we conclude that we could not detect an autonomous te that contained the genes that could have been responsible for the insertion of the non-autonomous te in csamlo <dig> fig.  <dig> there are  <dig> putative homologous tes in the cucumber reference genome. a blastn search was performed on the cucumber reference genomes with the ltr sequence of the te found to be inserted in csamlo <dig>  pairs of putative ltrs within 20 kb of one another were considered borders of putative tes.  <dig> putative tes were identified, chromosomal locations of which are indicated



occurrence of the te-allele of csamlo <dig> in cucumber germplasm
we were interested to see how frequently the te-allele of csamlo <dig> we have characterised in our resistant cucumber genotype occurs in the cucumber germplasm. as qi et al.  resequenced a core collection of  <dig> very divergent cucumber accessions  <cit> , we decided to perform an in silico search for the presence of the mutant csamlo <dig> allele containing the transposable element te) and/or the wild type  allele among those genotypes. for  <dig> resequenced accessions  we could only detect reads indicating presence of the te-allele. for  <dig> resequenced accessions  we could only find reads indicating presence of the wt-allele. for  <dig> accessions  we found reads indicating presence of both alleles. for the remaining two accessions , presence of neither of the alleles could be identified . the te-allele of csamlo <dig> was present in three out of the four geographic groups of accessions  as defined by qi et al.  <cit> . one of the  <dig> accessions in which the te-allele of csamlo <dig> was detected  belongs to the wild form of cucumber, cucumis sativus var. hardwickii, whereas the other  <dig> accessions belong to the cultivated form of cucumber, c. sativus var. sativus.table  <dig> thirty-one out of  <dig> resequenced cucumber accessions have the te-allele of csamlo8


total reads of  <dig> recently resequenced cucumber accessions  <cit>  were assayed in silico for the presence of reads indicating the presence of either the allele of csamlo <dig> characterised by the insertion of a te, or the wild-type allele. the amount of reads indicating presence of either the te-allele or the wt-allele of csamlo <dig> is given. database number, accession names and geographic groups of accessions were obtained from  <cit> 



inoculation with p. xanthii induced transcription of csamlo <dig> in hypocotyl tissue, but not in leaf tissue of susceptible cucumber
mlo genes involved in pm susceptibility are upregulated in several plant species several hours after inoculation . to see whether the same holds true for csamlo <dig>  we performed qrt-pcr experiments to quantify csamlo <dig> transcript abundances in hypocotyl, cotyledon and leaf tissues of pm susceptible and resistant cucumber plants, prior to and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after pm inoculation . for pm susceptible plants, we found that in hypocotyl tissue csamlo <dig> transcript abundance was significantly higher at  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi  compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation . the significant difference had disappeared  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi . contrastingly, csamlo <dig> transcript abundances in cotyledons and true leaves were not significantly altered at any of the evaluated time points after pm inoculation  . for pm resistant plants, we found that csamlo <dig> transcript abundance was not significantly higher in any tissue at any time point after inoculation compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation . in hypocotyl tissue, transcript abundance was significantly lower at  <dig> hpi ,  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi  compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation . in cotyledon tissue, transcript abundance was significantly lower at  <dig> hpi  compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation .fig.  <dig> 
csamlo <dig> transcription is induced after inoculation with podosphaera xanthii in hypocotyl tissue, but not in cotyledon or true leaf tissue. susceptible  and resistant  cucumber seedlings were inoculated with a p. xanthii spore suspension. prior to and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h post inoculation, hypocotyl, cotyledon and true leaf tissue were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. relative quantification of csamlo <dig> expression was performed by qrt-pcr. fold changes were normalised relative to csamlo <dig> expression prior to inoculation. bars represent the average fold change over three independent biological replicates. error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. asterisks indicate significant differences to the expression prior to inoculation 



discussion
csamlo <dig> is a functional susceptibility gene for pm in cucumber
several studies characterised some, but not all, clade v mlo genes as being required for pm susceptibility in different dicotyledonous plant species . here we have shown that heterologous expression of the cucumber gene csamlo <dig> in slmlo <dig> mutant tomato background restored pm susceptibility, providing evidence for the role of csamlo <dig> as a susceptibility gene for pm in cucumber . as the role of clade v mlo genes in susceptibility to pm seems to be evolutionary conserved between divergent dicotyledonous plant families, e.g., brassicaceae  <cit> , solanaceae  <cit> , fabaceae  <cit> , vitaceae  <cit> , rosaceae  <cit>  and now also cucurbitaceae, it is probable that in other economically important species belonging to the family cucurbitaceae, such as melon  and pumpkin  clade v mlo genes will also play a role in pm susceptibility. indeed, in a patent application a functional complementation of arabidopsis atmlo <dig>  atmlo <dig>  and atmlo <dig> , <dig> mutants by a melon mlo-like gene was claimed to partially restore pm susceptibility, based on the percentage of diseased leaf area in  <dig> to  <dig> primary transformants  <cit> . alignment of this melon mlo gene with the three clade v genes of cucumber revealed that the gene from melon is most similar to csamlo <dig>  and less alike to the two other clade v genes   <cit> . this is consistent with our finding that csamlo <dig> is a s-gene for pm. in tomato we observed that complementation of slmlo <dig> loss-of-function mutants with csamlo <dig> restored pm susceptibility, with individual transformants with higher csamlo <dig> expression generally being more susceptible to pm than transformants with lower csamlo <dig> expression . it seems possible that in the case of complementation of arabidopsis mutants by the melon mlo gene there was also a quantitative effect due to different levels of melon mlo expression in individual transformants, leading to the conclusion that the melon mlo gene only partially restores susceptibility whereas it was possibly due to the fact that transgene expression was not high enough to fully complement the loss of atmlo function.

transposon insertion in csamlo <dig> leads to aberrant splicing and therefore to loss of the s-gene function
by cloning csamlo <dig> from cdna of a pm resistant cucumber genotype that is homozygous for the hypocotyl resistance qtl, we found evidence for aberrant splicing of csamlo <dig> in this genotype, leading to products with deletions of respectively  <dig> and 174 bp in exon  <dig>  compared to the wt gene. we showed that these deletions are predicted to lead to loss of  <dig> respectively  <dig> amino acid residues in the third cytoplasmic loop of the csamlo <dig> protein, in a highly conserved region between clade v mlo proteins from different species . as it was previously shown that cytoplasmic loop-loop interplay is required for mlo function  <cit> , we anticipated that such rather big deletions in one of the cytoplasmic loops, if the protein should properly fold at all, would lead to loss-of-function of the protein. indeed, we showed here that expression of the ∆ <dig> variant of csamlo <dig> in slmlo mutant tomato background failed to restore pm susceptibility . this makes cucumber, after barley  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and pea  <cit> , the fourth plant species in which a natural mutation in an mlo gene has been found to lead to resistance. although we did not try to complement slmlo mutant tomato with the 72 bp deletion variant of csamlo <dig>  and thus cannot rule out the possibility that it is  functional as an s gene, we expect that the result will be similar to the 174 bp deletion variant, given the conservedness of the deleted region.

to determine the reason for the aberrant splicing of csamlo <dig> in the resistant cucumber genotype, we set out to amplify and sequence the genomic region of csamlo <dig> in which the deletions were detected. in this way, we discovered a 1449 bp insertion in exon  <dig> of the gene compared to the reference genome. sequence analysis of the insertion revealed the presence of 100 % identical ltrs and tsds, but no open reading frames or any similarity to known proteins or genes , leading to the conclusion that the insertion is probably a class i, order ltr  transposable element , following the te classification scheme proposed by wicker et al.  <cit> . the fact that the ltrs are completely identical to one another is an indication that the te is relatively recently inserted. the integration of a transposable element in a mlo gene, leading to aberrant splicing of transcripts and in that way to loss of gene function, is reminiscent of the findings in the pea psmlo <dig> gene, where in one of the alleles  the integration of an ogre ltr retrotransposon lead to aberrant splicing  <cit> .

we analysed putative tes with similar ltrs , and found no functional orfs in these tes, confirming that we are dealing with a family of non-autonomous tes. additionally, a large amount of ltr singlets  were detected, as only  <dig> out of the  <dig> detected ltrs could be assigned to a putative te . ltr singlets presumably originate from the unequal recombination between two ltrs of a single element  <cit> , or from assembling errors of the reference genome. it is known that plant genomes are to a great extent shaped by the integration of large amounts of transposable elements, with ltr retrotransposons being the most abundant among them . the cucumber genome was shown to be no exception to this, with 24 % of the genome consisting of transposable elements and ltr retrotransposons comprising  <dig>  % of the genome  <cit> . to our knowledge, the te we found to be inserted in csamlo <dig> is the first te with a reported effect on a cucumber gene. it seems likely that more tes with an effect on genes in cucumber will be found in the future.

csamlo <dig> is upregulated upon p. xanthii inoculation in hypocotyl tissue only
resistance to pm in cucumber has previously been reported to be tissue specific, with an important, recessively inherited gene providing full pm resistance in hypocotyl tissue and partial resistance in leafs  <cit> . recently, pm resistance of cucumber was mapped in multiple tissues separately. the strongest qtl for hypocotyl resistance, pm <dig>  was mapped on chromosome  <dig>  in a region containing csamlo <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we showed that csamlo <dig> was, in susceptible cucumber, transcriptionally upregulated in hypocotyl tissue at  <dig> and 6 h post inoculation, but not in cotyledon or leaf samples . apparently, the ability of the pathogen to upregulate csamlo <dig> expression is specific for hypocotyl tissue. therefore, we postulate that it is very well possible that pm resistance caused by a loss of function allele of csamlo <dig> would also be specific for hypocotyl tissue.

interestingly, csamlo <dig> was not found to be transcriptionally upregulated in hypocotyl tissue  in the resistant cucumber line . this is in sharp contrast with the findings in barley  <cit>  where transcription of the mlo gene seemed to be even stronger induced upon pm inoculation in mlo loss-of-function mutants compared to wild type plants. in tomato it was found that transcription of the slmlo <dig> gene was slightly upregulated upon pm inoculation in slmlo <dig> loss of function mutants, but to a far lesser extent than in wild type plants  <cit> . although it remains a question why the pathogen is unable to upregulate csamlo <dig> expression in our resistant cucumber line several explanations might be offered, e.g., lesser transcript stability of the mutant csamlo <dig> transcripts, differences in the promotor region of the mutant allele of csamlo <dig> or differences in other genes required for csamlo <dig> expression compared to the susceptible cultivar.

previously, rna-seq experiments on cucumber leaf tissue revealed that of the thirteen csamlo genes only csamlo <dig>  another clade v mlo gene, was transcriptionally upregulated after inoculation with p. xanthii  <cit> . this is consistent with our finding that csamlo <dig> is not upregulated in leaf samples after pm inoculation . it is possible that csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are functionally redundant, but are specifically expressed in separate tissues . to our knowledge there are no other examples of tissue specialization in mlo-like s genes of other species. in arabidopsis, which also has three clade v mlo genes, atmlo <dig> mutants were found to be partially resistant, double mutants atmlo2/atmlo <dig> or atmlo2/atmlo <dig> were more resistant than atmlo <dig> single mutants, and triple mutants atmlo2/atmlo6/atmlo <dig> were completely resistant  <cit> . it is not yet known by what mechanism mlo genes are transcriptionally upregulated upon pm infection, although it would seem intuitive to hypothesise that it is an active process caused by an effector of the fungus. given the tissue specificity of mlo upregulation in cucumber, this might be an interesting model to investigate the mechanism of mlo upregulation by pm fungi.

the transposon insertion allele of csamlo <dig> occurs frequently in cucumber germplasm
interestingly, during the preparation of this manuscript, another group reported the fine-mapping of a qtl for pm resistance on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  which they called pm <dig> , to a region of 170 kb containing  <dig> predicted genes. the main candidate gene in this region was found to be a mlo like gene, which appears to be the same as csamlo <dig> in our study. by cloning and sequencing of this gene from genomic dna of their resistant parent, line s <dig>  as well as two additional unrelated resistant lines, s <dig> and s <dig>  they found that they contained a 1449 bp insert in the 11th exon of the gene  <cit> . sequence analysis indicates that the location and sequence of the insertion found in their study are completely identical to the ltr retrotransposon described in this study. these researchers did not report on cloning the coding sequence of csamlo <dig> in their material, nor on complementation experiments.

additionally, a patent was filed describing an allele of cskip <dig>  a gene claimed to provide pm resistance, shown to harbour a 72 bp deletion in the coding sequence  <cit> . although it is not shown in the patent, the occurrence of this allele is claimed to be caused by the integration of a transposon-like element in the 11th exon of the gene. sequence analysis revealed that cskip <dig> is in fact the same gene as csamlo <dig>  and the 72 bp deletion allele they describe is the same as the 72 bp deletion we found in our material. interestingly the patent does not describe the 174 bp deletion which we found, but an in silico prediction showed that the 174 bp deletion variant would not be amplified by the primers they chose to amplify the partial csamlo <dig> sequence. in the patent no functional proof is given that this allele of csamlo <dig> indeed leads to resistance.

as several groups independently found the same allele of csamlo <dig> in different, to our knowledge unrelated, resistant cucumber genotypes, we were interested to know how often this allele occurs in the global cucumber germplasm. therefore, we performed an in silico screen on a collection of  <dig> recently resequenced cucumber accessions  <cit>  for the presence and/or absence of the transposable element  allele of csamlo <dig>  we found evidence for the presence of the te-allele, either homozygously or heterozygously, in at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> accessions , indicating that this particular allele of csamlo <dig> occurs quite often. for some accessions only a small number of reads indicating presence/absence of the te allele was found, potentially due to a low read coverage at this locus. it is therefore possible that in some accessions now identified as homozygous for either the te-allele or the wt allele of csamlo <dig>  reads indicative of the other allele were missed due to low read coverage, so there might be some heterozygous accessions misidentified as being homozygous for one of the alleles.

as we found that the te allele of csamlo <dig> leads to pm resistance, it might have been selected for by cucumber breeders, by selecting for the most resistant plants. interestingly one of the accessions found to have the te-allele of csamlo <dig> was pi  <dig>  a wild accession of c. sativus var. hardwickii collected in india in  <dig>  this indicates that the te-allele of csamlo <dig> does occur in the wild, and might have been introgressed in cultivated cucumber from pi  <dig> or a related hardwickii accession.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provide evidence for a role of csamlo <dig> as a s gene for powdery mildew  susceptibility. we show that complementation by csamlo <dig> overexpression in slmlo <dig> mutant tomato background restores pm susceptibility. we also show that a mutant allele of csamlo <dig> cloned from resistant cucumber fails to restore pm susceptibility. as csamlo <dig> is located in the region where a qtl for hypocotyl specific resistance was detected, we determined csamlo <dig> expression in different tissues of pm inoculated plants, and found that csamlo <dig> was only transcriptionally upregulated in hypocotyl tissue. on this basis we conclude that the mutant allele of csamlo <dig> is causal to the observed hypocotyl resistance towards pm in cucumber.
