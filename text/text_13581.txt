BACKGROUND
the solanaceae is an unusually divergent family consisting of approximately  <dig> genera and  <dig> - <dig>  species  <cit> . members of the solanaceae have evolved into extremely divergent forms, ranging from trees to annual herbs, and they occupy diverse habitats ranging from deserts to aquatic areas  <cit> . such hyper-diversity in one family makes it useful to study plant adaptation and diversification. despite this diversity, all solanaceous species evolved during the last  <dig> million years  <cit> . furthermore, almost all members share the same chromosome number   <cit> .

to date, diversity within the solanaceae has been studied by comparative genome analyses using common genetic markers. as a result, we know that the solanaceae genomes have undergone relatively small numbers of chromosomal rearrangements , maintaining well-conserved gene content and order  <cit> . the conservation of the solanaceae genic region was also identified by the comparison of a syntenic segment in eggplant, pepper, petunia and tomato  <cit> .

despite such conservation, the genome sizes of the solanaceae family members are diverse. for example, the genome size of the solanum tuberosum  is  <dig> mb, s. lycopersicum   <dig> mb, petunia hybrida   <dig> mb, and capsicum annuum   <dig> mb. however, the genetic analyses conducted to date were not successful at explaining genome size diversity due to limitations in the genetic markers. hence, a sequence-level analysis to investigate the cause of the genome size diversity is required.

among the solanaceous species, pepper and tomato show strong advantages for the study of genome size difference because of following reasons. first, the genome size of pepper is three times larger than that of tomato. second, the duplication of the whole genome did not occur during the evolution of both species  <cit> . third, although pepper and tomato show large size differences in their genomes, their speciation is estimated to have occurred recently   <cit> , which makes them not as closely related as potato and tomato, but more closely related than tobacco and tomato within the solanaceae family  <cit> . therefore, the investigation of genome diversity between pepper and tomato can represent the general trend of genome diversification among solanaceous members that have not undergone the whole genome duplication.

to date, most studies related to the pepper genome have been carried out by generating genetic maps  <cit> . in contrast, the structure of the tomato euchromatic and heterochromatic regions has been the subject of several studies through the analyses of tomato bac sequences  <cit> . furthermore, the tomato genome sequencing project is currently underway, with the goal of generating a reference genome in the solanaceae  <cit> .

as a first study concerning the expansion of the pepper genome, the present work addresses the causes behind the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions. for this purpose,  <dig>  mb of pepper sequences from  <dig>  bac clones selected from euchromatin-enriched regions were generated. using information from the tomato genome project,  <dig>  mb bac sequences of tomato were chosen for comparing orthologous gene-rich sequences and the constitution of repetitive elements between the pepper and tomato genomes. we used fluorescence in situ hybridization  to support the results. this study presents an example of the solanaceae genome diversity revealing how the pepper euchromatic region was expanded.

RESULTS
sequencing of pepper bac clones
to produce the pepper sequence data representative of all pepper euchromatic regions,  <dig>  pepper bac clones of an average insert size of  <dig> kb  <cit>  were sequenced using pyrosequencing technology. to enrich the euchromatic regions, bac clones were selected by bac screening using labelled cdnas derived from pepper mrnas . a total of  <dig>  mb of assembled sequences was obtained from  <dig> Ã— coverage sequences generated by  <dig> gs flx-titanium . to avoid the bias caused by the short contig length, we used the long contigs, whose length is over  <dig> kb , in the analyses . in addition, ten selected pepper bac clones containing gene-rich regions of pepper chromosome  <dig> were sequenced using sanger methods, resulting in a total of  <dig>  bp contig sequences . three of the ten bac sequences were assembled into one contig, resulting in a total of eight full-contig bac sequences. these eight full-contig bac sequences were used in the comparative micro-synteny analysis of pepper and tomato euchromatic regions.

comparison of visible genome structures
prior to the comparative sequence analysis between pepper and tomato, we analyzed visible chromosome structures in pepper and tomato using pachytene chromosomes. on visual inspection, the pepper and tomato chromosomes showed differences in structure. the tomato heterochromatic regions were mainly located on the pericentromeric regions and the euchromatic regions were clearly distinct from the heterochromatin structure . in contrast, the pepper pachytene chromosomes showed more extensive heterochromatic regions . furthermore, the pepper euchromatic regions were intermixed with the heterochromatin structure .

comparison of repetitive elements in the orthologous gene-rich regions
to investigate the reasons for the presence of differences in euchromatin structure between both genomes, the orthologous gene-rich sequences of pepper and tomato were compared. to compare within the same chromosome, the orthologous gene-rich sequences were selected in chromosome  <dig> that has no inter-chromosomal crossover between both species  <cit> . bac sequences distributed over seven positions in chromosome  <dig> were used to avoid bias based on position within the chromosome . the positions of the bac sequences were determined using genetic markers on the tomato genetic map   <cit> . on the basis of tomato chromosome  <dig>  the centromere is located at the top  of the tomato genetic map   <cit> . eight orthologous pepper bac sequences of a total of  <dig>  bp were compared with the tomato sequences consisting of  <dig>  bp .

the comparative analysis of the orthologous gene-rich sequences revealed many insertions found exclusively in the pepper sequences. the insertions were transposable elements, and there were  <dig> transposable elements in the compared pepper sequences . boundary of the ltr-retrotransposons was determined in  <dig> elements by manual inspection . the else transposons were found by gene prediction and repeat blast search in repbase  <cit> . all of the transposable elements were found in the inter-genic regions, therefore without a disruption of the other structural genes. the insertion of the transposable elements resulted in a doubling of the pepper sequence size in comparison to that of tomato. accordingly, the gene density was lower in pepper  than in tomato .

to determine the most prevalent type of transposon, the composition of the repetitive elements found in the compared sequences was analyzed. by repeat blast search in repbase, a total of  <dig>  bp of transposon sequences were found in pepper and  <dig>  bp in tomato. the repeat sequences were classified into three groups .

among identified transposable elements, ltr-retrotransposon sequences were the most abundant. most of the ltr-retrotransposons were found in the pepper sequences . in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> transposable elements found in pepper sequences were identified as ltr retrotransposons. the pepper sequences contained ltr-retrotransposon sequences with a frequency approximately  <dig> times higher than in the tomato sequences. the other two repeat classes also presented higher proportions in pepper than in tomato. pepper had about  <dig>  times as many dna transposons,  <dig> times the number of non-ltr retrotransposons .

according to our transposon annotation results, the total length of the transposons found was  <dig>  bp . among them, ty3/gypsy-like element was the most abundant as  <dig>  bp in total length , which suggests its important role in pepper euchromatin expansion. the next was ty1/copia-like elements as  <dig>  bp . the non-ltr retrotransposon and dna transposon was  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively.

similar gene composition between pepper and tomato
in contrast to the repetitive elements, gene constitution less affected the difference in the sequence size. in the compared sequences, a total of  <dig> genes were predicted excluding the transposable element genes. these included  <dig> pepper genes and  <dig> tomato genes . the total length of the genes combined was  <dig>  bp in pepper and  <dig>  bp in tomato, showing a length difference of  <dig>  bp. the total gene-length difference corresponded to approximately 10% of the total length difference of the compared sequences. the total gene-length difference was mainly caused by the intron-length difference. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were paired into  <dig> orthologous sets . in these sets the average length of the pepper coding regions was  <dig>  bp, which was  <dig> bp longer than that of tomato , whereas the average intron length in pepper was  <dig>  bp, which was  <dig> bp longer than that of tomato . among the  <dig> orthologous sets, six sets  consisted of duplicated genes. these six sets corresponded to  <dig> of the  <dig> genes , of which  <dig> genes were in pepper and  <dig> in tomato . hence, there was no remarkable bias in gene duplication number between both species .

identification of ltr retrotransposons in the pepper and tomato genome sequences
the causes for the accumulation of ltr retrotransposons in the pepper euchromatic regions were investigated by comparing the overall constitution of ltr retrotransposons between pepper and tomato by phylogenetic analysis. for this analysis, reverse transcriptase  sequences, which are constitutive genes in ltr retrotransposons  <cit> , were identified from the pepper and tomato genome sequences. the rts were classified into ty3/gypsy and ty1/copia types by blast search in repbase  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ty3/gypsy-like and  <dig> ty1/copia-like tomato rts were identified from  <dig>  mb of tomato bac sequences  and  <dig> ty3/gypsy-like and  <dig> ty1/copia-like pepper rts were found in the  <dig>  mb pepper bac sequences. because the tomato genome project focused on the gene-rich region, the number of heterochromatin-preferential ltr retrotransposons might be underestimated in this comparison.

differential accumulation of a group of ty3/gypsy-like elements
the phylogenetic tree of ty3/gypsy-like elements was generated by  <dig> pepper and  <dig> tomato rts. a total of three subgroups were clearly identified from the phylogenetic tree . each subgroup was classified on the basis of reported elements by blast search against gydb . the blast results with high confidence  were used for classification reference  <cit> . the representative elements of each subgroup which are acquired from the gydb were also included in the phylogenetic tree. according to the classification, the three groups belonged to tat and athila subgroups, which belong to athila/tat, and to del subgroup, which belongs to chromoviruses. most of the ty3/gypsy-like elements were found in the three major subgroups.

the ty3/gypsy-like elements in the del subgroup were identified as being accumulated in the pericentromeric heterochromatin. yang et al. reported that the pcrt <dig> in the del subgroup is a tomato ty3/gypsy-like element distributed throughout pericentromeric heterochromatin of tomato  <cit> . this result was consistent with our fish result of another tomato del element . furthermore, the fish result of the pepper del element exhibited the same distribution pattern as that of tomato . these results suggest that the del elements constitute pericentromeric heterochromatin in both genomes, which means they do not affect euchromatin expansion.

the differences that may affect the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions were observed in the tat and athila subgroups. the number of pepper tat and athila elements was approximately twice the number in tomato . according to the previous report by yang et al., pcrt <dig> and pcrt <dig> are the tomato ty3/gypsy-like elements preferentially distributed in the tomato heterochromatic regions  <cit> . these two elements belonged to athila and tat respectively, suggesting that the tomato ty3/gypsy-like elements in these groups are accumulated in heterochromatic regions. in contrast, the fish result of the pepper tat element showed randomly distributed signals throughout the pepper chromosomes including the euchromatic regions . furthermore, four of the nine black arrows indicating the pepper ty3/gypsy-like elements found in the compared pepper gene-rich sequences belonged to tat. likewise, two of the nine elements belonged to the athila subgroup, indicating the elements in this group are also found in pepper gene-rich regions. however, the del subgroup didn't contain any of the ty3/gypsy-like elements found in the pepper gene-rich sequences . these results show that, in contrast to the distribution in tomato, the pepper ty3/gypsy-like elements in the tat and athila subgroups are randomly inserted throughout the whole genome, including the euchromatic regions.

chromodomains in the ty3/gypsy-like elements
a chromodomain functions to recognize the heterochromatic regions when the ty3/gypsy-like elements insert into chromosomes  <cit> . to determine the chromatin selectivity of the ty3/gypsy-like elements, the existence of the chromodomain was investigated in each group. for this analysis,  <dig> intact ty3/gypsy-like elements were identified from the pepper and tomato sequences to check the chromodomain . except for the tat and athila elements, almost all of the other intact ty3/gypsy-like elements contained the chromodomain . the existence of the chromodomain in the del intact elements was consistent with the heterochromatin-preferential accumulation of the del elements in both species. likewise, the absence of the chromodomain in tat and athila was consistent with the random accumulation of pepper elements. however, the absence of the chromodomain was in disagreement with the anticipated heterochromatin-preferential accumulation of tomato tat and athila elements.

to determine whether the tomato tat and athila elements are really accumulated in the heterochromatic regions in sequence-level, we investigated gene densities of the  <dig> tomato bac sequences that contain the tat and athila elements . two of the  <dig> tomato bac sequences were gene-rich regions with a gene density similar to that of the compared tomato gene-rich sequences . however, the remaining  <dig> bac sequences were gene-poor regions, in which the minimum gene density was about three times lower than that of the compared tomato gene-rich sequences. considering that the tomato sequences are mainly from euchromatic regions, the accumulation of the tomato tat and athila elements shows a bias toward the heterochromatic regions. this result was consistent with the heterochromatin preferential distributions of the pcrt <dig> and pcrt <dig>  indicating that the tomato tat and athila elements are accumulated in heterochromatic regions without the chromodomain.

proportion of the intact pepper ty3/gypsy-like elements in the genome
the proportion of the pepper ty3/gypsy-like elements in the genome was estimated using the intact ltr retrotransposons  . the proportion of the individual elements was broadly different according to the classified groups. the average proportion of the tat elements was  <dig> % but the athila was  <dig> %, suggesting more active accumulation of the tat elements. the elements in the del showed higher proportion than other classified groups in the genome as  <dig> % of average proportion.

highly diversified features with similar lineage collections of ty1/copia-like elements
the phylogenetic tree of ty1/copia-like elements presented highly diversified features that differed from those of ty3/gypsy-like elements. however they also showed similar lineage collections between pepper and tomato. by blast search against gydb, four subgroups of the ty3/copia-like elements, tork, sire, oryco, and retrofit, were classified . the tork was constituted with four subgroups that match to fourf, tork <dig>  tnt- <dig>  and batata. the six pepper ty1/copia-like elements found in the eight orthologous pepper bac sequences are indicated by black arrows in figure  <dig>  these six elements belonged to diverse phylogenetic positions in the phylogenetic tree . one of the six pepper elements that belongs to the retrofit was tested by fish analysis, and the signals distributed randomly on the chromosomes . the fish signals of the tomato ty1/copia-like element that belongs to the tork <dig> of the tork subgroup were also observed in both brightly and darkly stained chromosome regions, indicating its distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions . on the other hand, the fish signals of tomato batata element in the tork subgroup and the elements in the sire subgroup were observed mainly in the brightly stained chromosome regions, indicating a heterochromatin-preferential distribution .

discussion
the results of the present study revealed that one of the important factors for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions was the massive accumulation of the pepper tat and athila elements. in the tat and athila subgroups, the ty3/gypsy-like elements were found to be approximately two times more abundant in pepper than tomato. considering that the pepper sequences used in this study were smaller than those of tomato in terms of total length  and in each contig length , the number of pepper tat and athila elements would further exceed that of tomato. given that the tomato tat and athila elements preferentially accumulated in the heterochromatic regions , the higher copy number and random insertion of the pepper tat and athila elements suggests their important role in the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions.

according to the fish analyses, the del elements in both pepper and tomato genomes were identified as forming the pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks. unlike the ty1/copia-like elements, the ty3/gypsy-like elements that constitute pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks are known to be selectively inserted into the heterochromatic regions in a. thaliana  <cit> . the existence of the chromodomain in both pepper and tomato del intact elements can explain this insertion selectivity. the insertion site preferences of ltr retrotransposons have also been observed in other plant genomes, including conifers, and members of the genus helianthus  <cit> . although the number of del elements is predominant in the phylogenetic tree, accumulation of the del elements would have expanded the pericentromeric heterochromatin, not affecting euchromatin expansion in both species.

pereira reported that the ty1/copia-like elements in a. thaliana were randomly inserted into the whole genome, after which they underwent purifying selection in euchromatic regions  <cit> . this resulted in the preferential accumulation of the ty1/copia-like elements in the pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks of a. thaliana genome. in the present study, a similar phenomenon was detected in the heterochromatin preferential accumulation of the tomato ty3/gypsy-like elements that belong to tat and athila . the absence of the chromodomain in the elements indicates its initial random insertions in the genome. however, the purifying selection may have been eliminated the tomato tat and athila elements from the tomato euchromatic regions, resulting in their preferential accumulation in the heterochromatic regions.

the comparative analysis of the ltr retrotransposons in the present study revealed a similar collection of lineages in both ty3/gypsy-like and ty1/copia-like elements. given that the ltr retrotransposons of the same lineage have similar characteristics, both genomes would have accumulated the ty1/copia-like elements and ty3/gypsy-like elements of the tat and athila in their euchromatic regions. however, the copy number of the elements in the tomato euchromatic regions may have been reduced due to the purifying selection, which could have resulted in the lower accumulation of the ltr retrotransposons in the tomato euchromatic regions than in those of pepper.

the number of pepper del elements corresponded to twice the number of tomato del elements . this difference was partially due to the euchromatin selective sequencing of the tomato genome project. although the pepper bac clones were selected by the labelled cdnas of mrnas, our bioinformatics survey suggested that a large portion of pepper bac clones contained heterochromatic regions. this phenomenon can be caused by contamination with the transcripts of repetitive elements, such as retrotransposons, during the selection of the bac clones.

the expansion of genome sizes through the accumulation of ltr retrotransposons is well documented among flowering plants  <cit> . based on the results of the present study, the expansion of the pepper genome is also due to the accumulation of ltr retrotransposons. a similar comparative analysis of repetitive elements in close species was carried out between a. thaliana and brassica oleracea by zang et al.  <cit> . zang et al. reported that the large size of the b. oleracea genome is accounted by the higher copy number of each type of transposable elements within a similar collection of lineages, explaining the overall genome expansion  <cit> . however, the gene densities of both genomes were  <dig>  kb/gene in a. thaliana and  <dig>  kb/gene in b. oleracea  <cit> , indicating that the euchromatic regions of both genomes are highly gene-rich, as is the case in tomato. in contrast with b. oleracea, pepper has an expanded euchromatin structure, and the present results explained the expansion of the euchromatic regions. hence, the comparison of the pepper and tomato genomes can provide new insights into the expansion of euchromatic regions by the accumulation of repetitive elements.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study show that the ty3/gypsy-like elements in the tat and athila play an important role in the expansion of the pepper euchromatic regions. the genic regions of pepper and tomato were found to be well conserved with regards to gene order and content. however, the euchromatic regions in pepper were expanded to twice the size of those in tomato, mainly due to the insertion of ltr retrotransposons. the ltr retrotransposons in the pepper euchromatic regions may also explain why the pepper euchromatic regions look like intermixed with the heterochromatin structures.
