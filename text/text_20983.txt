BACKGROUND
genomic sequence analysis predicts that integral membrane proteins constitute 20–30% of all sequenced prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. these proteins are critical for many essential cellular functions and constitute  <dig> to 70% of current drug targets  <cit> . however, to date, less than 1% of the atomic resolution structures in the protein data bank represent membrane proteins  <cit> . the remarkable gap between the significance of membrane proteins and the limited number of high resolution membrane protein structures is, in part, due to the availability of membrane proteins for structural biology.

for structure determination, obtaining enough highly homogeneous protein is the first substantial challenge, especially for membrane proteins  <cit> . for a specific membrane protein, overexpression of a functional state is so difficult that researchers often have to perform numerous expression trials. apart from selection of a suitable strain as the host and optimization of expression conditions, vector construct optimization can be critical, including selection of promoters, fusion partners, truncation, mutation and other protein engineering methods  <cit> . such "trial and error" processes can be very time consuming.

the ligation independent cloning  approach was developed for direct cloning of pcr products without restriction enzyme digestion or ligation reactions  <cit> . by making use of the 3'–5' exonuclease activity of t <dig> dna polymerase, the specific 12– <dig> nucleotide single stranded overhangs can be created for both the vector and the insert. after annealing in vitro and transformation into the host cells, the vector and the insert are covalently ligated in vivo to form a circular plasmid. generally, the lic approach features simplicity and very low non-recombinant background, and it is suitable for high throughput cloning  <cit> .

there is no doubt that the construction of a high throughput cloning and expression screening platform would facilitate expression optimization through construction of fusion proteins and protein engineering as well as the characterization of membrane proteins. in the present effort, we have developed such a platform, which consists of a series of ligation independent clone  based vectors, for high throughput cloning and expression screening and then tested the platform with  <dig> putative integral membrane proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis. these targets have a molecular weight range lower than  <dig> kda and one to four transmembrane α-helices. the results show that, by using this platform, genes encoding membrane proteins can be efficiently cloned for initial expression screening. for those proteins which could not be well expressed in the initial screening, three fusion partners were used to successfully facilitate their overexpression.

methods
construction of expression vectors
in the present work, the vectors used were modified from the lic expression vector pmcgs <dig>  <cit>  . to facilitate the addition of fusion partner proteins onto the n terminus, a spei restriction site was introduced into the pmcsg <dig> vector right after the his tag by pcr , resulting in a new vector, named ptbsg. the maltose binding protein  gene was amplified by pcr by using the sense primer 5'-ggactagtaaaatcgaagaaggtaaactg-3' and anti-sense primer 5'-cggg gtaccagtctgcgcgtctttcag-3'. the glutathione s-transferase  gene was amplified by using the sense primer 5'-ggactagtctaggttattgga aaattaag-3' and the anti-sense primer 5'-cggggtaccatccgatttt ggaggatggtc-3'. the ketosteroid isomerase  gene was amplified by using the sense primer 5'-ggactagtcataccccagaacacatc-3' and the anti-sense primer 5'-ggggtaccctggcatgcgtgaatattc-3'. the pcr products were digested with restriction enzymes spei and kpni, and then ligated into the ptbsg vector digested with the same enzymes, resulting in  <dig> fusion vectors .

cloning
methods for target selection of membrane proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis were used as described  <cit> . the molecular weight of the target proteins were limited to about  <dig> kda . target genes were amplified by pcr using a pair of primers in which the sense primer began with the sequence 5'-tacttccaatccaatgca-3' followed by the target gene and the anti-sense primer began with the sequence 5'-ttatccacttccaatg-3' followed by the complement of a stop codon and the c-terminus of the target gene. the volume of a typical reaction mixture was  <dig> μl, the product was cleaned using a ym- <dig> spin column  and recovered in  <dig> μl of buffer including  <dig> mm tris  and  <dig> mm edta. the vector  was digested with ssp <dig> for two hours and applied to dna agarose electrophoresis. the band corresponding to the cleaved vector was carefully sliced and recovered from the gel using the qia® gel extraction kit  and then treated with t <dig> dna polymerase  in the presence of dgtp. the insert was treated with dctp and t <dig> dna polymerase at room temperature for  <dig> minutes then heated at 75°c for  <dig> minutes to stop the reaction. annealing was carried out simply by mixing  <dig> μl of the digested vector,  <dig> μl of the insert and  <dig> μl of edta  and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. the annealed plasmid was transformed into dh5α competent cells. positive clones were screened by pcr and then sequenced. cloned genes were transformed into the expression host, bl21-rp codon plus .

protein expression screening
the e. coli cells harboring the expression vector were grown on lb agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol. a single clone was picked and inoculated into  <dig> ml lb media for overnight growth.  <dig> μl of the overnight culture was then inoculated into  <dig> ml lb media, and the expression was induced with the addition of  <dig>  mm iptg when od <dig> reached  <dig> . the culture was grown for an additional  <dig> hours at 37°c. cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig> g for  <dig> min at 4°c, resuspended in  <dig> ml lysis buffer  and lysed by sonication  three times . the lysate was fractionated by centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig>  g. the supernatant normally contained soluble proteins and fragmented membranes, while the pellet consisted of insoluble proteins . the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at 8°c to separate the membrane and soluble protein fractions. the soluble, insoluble and membrane fractions were adjusted to the same volume with lysis buffer, and then  <dig> μl of each was mixed with  <dig> μl sample buffer  and  <dig> μl was loaded on 12% tricine sds-page gels followed by either coomassie staining or western blot using antibody against the his-tag of expressed proteins. control experiments were performed under the same experimental conditions without iptg induction.

small scale purification of rv0011c
mbp-rv0011c was expressed in  <dig> ml cultures as described above. the membrane fraction was collected and solubilized in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl, and 1% dpc at 4°c for  <dig> hour. after ultracentrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at 8°c, the supernatant was mixed with  <dig> μl ni2+-nta resin  which was pre-equilibrated with the wash buffer . after incubation at 4°c overnight with gentle shaking, the resin was extensively washed with the wash buffer and then eluted with the elution buffer . tev with an n terminal his tag was purified as reported previously  <cit>  and added at a mass ratio of 5: <dig> . the cleavage reaction was performed at 30°c for  <dig> hours. before re-loading on the ni2+-nta resin  to remove mbp and tev , the sample was dialyzed against the dialysis buffer  for  <dig> hours to remove imidazole. the re-loading was performed at 4°c overnight with gentle shaking, and then the flow through containing the released rv0011c was collected and analyzed by sds-page.

RESULTS
cloning through lic
as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> open reading frames  identified in the m. tuberculosis genome as putative helical membrane proteins were targeted. these proteins range in molecular weight from  <dig>  to  <dig> kda with  <dig> to  <dig> putative transmembrane helices, similar to the target genes studied in a previous effort  <cit> . only two of these targeted genes failed to be cloned using our lic method, while the conventional ligase dependent method used previously resulted in a cloning success rate of only 72%  <cit> . this substantial increase in cloning efficiency can be attributed to the simplicity of ligation independent cloning. the most difficult step in the ligase dependent method is ligation, whose efficiency is strongly influenced by the sequence of the sticky end, the efficiency of the restriction endonuclease enzyme digestion and the experimental conditions. for lic the ligation is performed in vivo by the intracellular system in the host cell, thereby avoiding the in vitro difficulties and increasing the cloning efficiency. lic has been successfully used in high throughput cloning for soluble proteins  <cit> , and the cloning efficiency in the present work is close to that for soluble proteins, indicating that this lic method is also effective for high throughput cloning of membrane proteins.

first round expression screening
as in the previous study  <cit> , it was found that many overexpressed membrane proteins were in the inclusion body fraction. the advantage of such expression is that the protein is often produced in large quantity  and in relatively pure form. proteins expressed in inclusion bodies are also protected from proteolysis. despite these advantages there are concerns about the refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies. however, methods have been designed to recover correctly folded proteins from these amorphous aggregates  <cit>  and recently there have been numerous examples of successful refolding  <cit> , including α helical membrane proteins  <cit> . the work from villaverde's group showed two important features of these precipitated aggregates, namely that they are structurally and dynamically heterogeneous, but importantly, they provided evidence that the aggregation in the inclusion bodies is reversible  <cit> , consistent with the recent refolding efforts.  <dig> of the membrane protein targets here, are also detected in the membrane fraction, and  <dig> proteins, including rv0008c, rv0258c, rv0424c, rv <dig>  rv1567c, rv1761c, rv2081c and rv2828c, were found to be overexpressed  in the membrane fraction. expression in the membrane fraction is a strong indication that the protein may be in its native or native-like conformation and that the in vitro refolding process can be avoided in sample preparations for various characterizations.

second round expression screening as fusion proteins
to improve upon the first round efforts, three commonly used fusion partners  were tested for the  <dig> putative membrane proteins that did not express in the first round of screening. table  <dig> lists the results for cloning and expression screening of the fusion proteins where expression was detected by coomassie blue staining. since the same lic site was used in all the vectors , t <dig> dna polymerase treated pcr products in the first round of screening were inserted directly into these vectors without any additional treatment. all the target genes were successfully inserted into the fusion protein vectors and expressed at high level from at least one of the fusion vectors. figure  <dig> shows the gels for expression of rv 0011c and rv  <dig> from the various vectors.

** symbol "x" indicates the estimated yield of the fusion protein from coomassie blue stained sds-page gel. one "x" corresponds to the expression yield between  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg for the fusion protein from  <dig> l lb culture.

as expected, all of the ksi fusion proteins aggregated in the inclusion body fraction . ksi appears to be effective for expression of small peptides that are unstable and/or toxic  <cit> . the same idea was applied in the present work: ksi forced the unstable or toxic membrane proteins into inclusion bodies, avoiding the proteolysis and/or potential toxic effects to the host cells. of the ten tested membrane proteins, rv  <dig> was the only one that was exclusively expressed as a ksi fusion protein. kcv protein, a viral potassium channel, is another example where ksi fusion has been uniquely successful .

gst is a highly soluble protein and frequently used as a fusion partner to increase the solubility and the yield of small soluble proteins. gst has been used to fuse with a low molecular weight membrane protein, psbh  <cit> , and it was found that the majority of the fusion protein was in a soluble state, facilitating the purification by affinity chromatography with immobilized glutathione resin. however, in our experiments, although the molecular weights of the target proteins were less than  <dig> kda, all of the expressed fusion proteins were obtained in the inclusion body fraction . it has been previously reported that the capability of gst to increase the solubility of the passenger proteins was weak among the commonly used fusion partners  <cit>  consistent with our results. compared with ksi fusion proteins, gst fusion proteins could be relatively easily solubilized and refolded in detergent micelles, facilitating the cleavage by a specific protease to release the passenger protein prior to further purification  <cit> .

mbp is known for its strong capability to increase the solubility of the target protein and has been extensively used as a fusion partner for both soluble and membrane proteins  <cit> . in our experiments, mbp fusion proteins show two distinguishing features . the mbp fusion proteins were frequently expressed in the membrane fraction, in sharp contrast with the ksi and gst fusion proteins. it is not surprising that mbp increases the solubility of the target protein, but how the mbp fusion tag enhances affinity for the membrane fraction is unclear. in addition, the expression levels of mbp fusion proteins are significantly larger than ksi and gst fusion proteins. even when the high molecular weight of mbp is taken into account, the expression of the target membrane proteins are still substantially higher than those for ksi and gst fusion proteins. both features make mbp an attractive fusion partner for membrane proteins: the target membrane proteins are not only overexpressed, but also in the native membrane. based on these and previous results  <cit> , the application of mbp as a fusion partner for membrane proteins is a powerful tool for the study of membrane proteins.

the fusion protein strategy is only effective if the fusion partner can be easily removed. as shown in figure  <dig>  mbp-rv0011c was purified to homogeneity and subjected to tev protease proteolysis. it is clear that after incubation with tev protease for  <dig> hours at 30°c, all of the fusion protein was cleaved, resulting in two bands on sds-page gel corresponding to mbp and rv0011c, respectively. as previously reported  <cit> , removal of mbp and tev can be simply achieved by passing the sample through a ni2+-nta column . it should be noted that there will be additional three residues  remaining after tev cleavage at the n terminus of the target protein.

in sum, the second round of expression screening resulted in the production of all the target proteins which were not expressed in the first round of screening. also unique features of three commonly used fusion partners  were illustrated for membrane protein expression. the data shown here strongly suggests that construction optimization, especially with respect to fusion partner protein screening, can be useful for enhancing membrane protein expression.

a platform for high throughput cloning and expression screening for membrane proteins
in the present work, the vectors, ptbsg and the three derivative fusion protein expression vectors, are the core components of the platform for high throughput cloning and expression screening for membrane proteins. the platform features the following four advantages:

high throughput cloning
through lic 95% of the target genes were successfully cloned on the first attempt. the use of identical treatments for all targeted genes makes lic an ideal method for membrane protein high throughput cloning.

high flexibility for different constructs
as shown in the previous section, fusion partners can be very useful for membrane protein expression. through the use of the same lic system, the pcr amplified target genes can be inserted into all the vectors for full expression screening, minimizing the efforts associated with a new clone/subclone process. in our structural genomics efforts, both the target genes and vectors were treated and stored as "standard modules", and construct optimization meant combining different modules. in addition, the restriction endonuclease sites for spei and kpni provide an open window for introducing new fusion partners  as new modules, making the present platform updatable.

highly efficient expression
by using the present platform, as shown in our experiments on  <dig> putative membrane proteins, all of the cloned genes  could be expressed and two thirds of the cloned genes  could be overexpressed in at least one construct. in addition, the target proteins detected only by western blot  in the first round of screening were not tested as fusion proteins, so there is considerable potential for enhancing the percentage of overexpression.

simplified downstream application
once cloning and expression screening is completed, downstream purification and characterization can be conveniently performed. in these vectors the n terminal his tag, which is compatible with detergents and chaotic agents, provides a simple and general method for downstream purification, especially for membrane proteins. in addition, for fusion proteins, the fusion partner can be easily removed by passing it through a ni2+-nta resin after tev proteolysis, leaving the target protein in the flow through.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, a lic based platform for membrane protein cloning and expression screening is demonstrated on  <dig> putative integral membrane proteins from the genome of m. tuberculosis and potentially suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance characterization. it was found that this platform was characterized by its high throughput and high efficiency for cloning and expression, as well as its high flexibility for construct optimization. it can be anticipated that this platform will be a useful tool for many studies of membrane proteins.
