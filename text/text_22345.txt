BACKGROUND
microparasites  and macroparasites  are important components of both external and within-host ecosystems  <cit> . the majority of animal and human hosts are co-infected with pathogens  <cit> , often a mix of micro- and macroparasites that can interact with each other to modify pathogen transmission, virulence, and host availability. while pathogens can compete with each other for within-host niches  <cit> , the majority of interactions appear to occur indirectly via the immune system  <cit> . through immunomodulation, infections can increase host susceptibility to other parasites  <cit> , enhance the intensity of other pathogen infections  <cit> , increase disease severity and pathology  <cit> , and increase disease duration  <cit> .

immunomodulation and immune tradeoffs are particularly strong in mixed microparasite-macroparasite infections. intracellular pathogens  generally cause the mammalian adaptive immune system to mobilize t-helper- <dig>  cells, while extracellular pathogens  usually trigger t-helper- <dig>  cells. the pathways leading to and from th1-type responses and th2-type responses are mutually cross-regulated; thus, hosts have difficulty simultaneously mounting effective th <dig> and th <dig> responses  <cit> . many studies have demonstrated that helminth infections are particularly adept at skewing immune responses toward the th <dig> arm  <cit>  and downregulating th <dig> immunity even in the face of microparasitic coinfections  <cit> . chronic helminth infections may also cause host immunosuppression, resulting in maintenance of the immunomodulating worm infection  <cit>  and increased susceptibility to coinfections  <cit> .

while many studies regarding the effects of coinfections and immune trade-offs have been conducted in laboratory settings, similar studies in wildlife are rare. fewer studies have been conducted regarding disease and immune seasonality, as these are challenging to model in laboratory settings and require difficult, longitudinal samplings in natural systems. seasonality is especially prominent in directly transmitted helminth infections, as free-living stages require temperature and moisture thresholds to develop and survive outside of hosts  <cit> . given the seasonality of these infections and their propensity to immunomodulate hosts, it is likely that helminths can help drive seasonal patterns of coinfections, but this hypothesis has rarely been examined. here we present what we believe to be the first longitudinal study simultaneously examining coinfections, seasonality, and complex immunity in wildlife hosts.

over three years, we examined a natural population of plains zebra  in etosha national park , namibia. we examined coinfections with ectoparasites , gastrointestinal  helminths, and anthrax in concert with several measures of immune function in these hosts. these three parasites are the only known pathogens infecting zebra hosts in enp; rabies does exist in this system, but there is no evidence that zebra play a role in its dynamics, and there is as yet no evidence of tick-borne pathogens in these enp hosts etosha ecological institute, eei, unpublished data;  <cit> . while enp zebra have a nearly 100% prevalence year-round with gi helminths, they experience a significant increase in infection intensity in the wet season compared to in the dry  <cit> . these new helminth infections are constrained to the wet season; the eggs and larvae require for survival moisture and moderate temperatures over the 1– <dig> week period of development in the external environment before they become infectious to new hosts  <cit> . the wet season is also when enp plains ungulates experience annual outbreaks of anthrax, a bacterial infection caused by the ingestion of bacillus anthracis spores from the environment  <cit> ; zebra account for 52% of all anthrax cases in enp, and 57% of all anthrax cases occur in march and april at the middle and end of the rainy season  <cit> . the reasons for anthrax seasonality, however, are not yet understood. the traditional spore concentration hypothesis   <cit>  cannot account for the enp rainy season outbreaks. there is as yet no definitive evidence that anthrax can multiply in the soil in natural systems  <cit> ; though see  <cit> , and thus anthrax spore levels likely do not increase under seasonal conditions. given the endemic nature of anthrax in enp, the prolonged survival times of spores in the environment  <cit> , the fact that anthrax deaths and sublethal infections do occur throughout the year in this system  <cit> , it is likely that animals come into contact with anthrax spores in all seasons, though some hosts may also ingest more b. anthracis in soil during wetter times  <cit> . while multiple factors are likely involved in the timing of anthrax outbreaks, we hypothesize that seasonal changes in host coinfection and immune factors may influence host susceptibility to this environmental pathogen. anthrax can cause death within hours to days  <cit> , though there is evidence that even very susceptible host species can experience a sublethal dose of anthrax and survive, in part, due to a humoral immune response against the anthrax protective antigen  toxin  <cit> . these anti-pa antibodies have been shown to be essential for adaptive protection against anthrax and can mature through memory responses with multiple infections, though otherwise tend to last less than six months  <cit> . as a bacterial infection, anthrax provokes a primarily th1-type immune response, a response in opposition to the th2-type immune response driven by helminth infections  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that the seasonally constrained increase in helminth infections in enp zebras result in immunomodulation that increases host susceptibility to anthrax, even in the face of likely increased immune resources during a time of nutritional surplus  <cit> .

we address this possibility by i) examining the host immune responses and immunomodulatory relationships that correlate with each of the three pathogens being examined, and ii) determining if gi parasite infection intensities most strongly correlate with host th2-type immune resource allocation that may influence immunity to anthrax.

RESULTS
seasonal comparisons
our study design involved the sampling of zebra over five seasons , resampling the same individuals as many times as possible over those five events to control for individual variation. we compared several immune and pathogen measures between seasons. to control for nutritional status and resource allocation, we measured total white blood cell  counts and hematocrits . total wbc counts are a broad indicator of how much a host has invested in immune resources  <cit> . hematocrit is a measure of percent of red blood cells per unit of blood, with a higher hematocrit often reflecting a higher nutritional state  <cit> . eosinophils are white blood cells often important for eliminating helminths, are quite specific for macroparasite infections, and have been shown to be a good measure of th <dig> responsiveness  <cit> . monocytes are white blood cells that are recruited and activated by interferon-gamma  in th <dig> immune reactions, and were used as a measurement of potential th <dig> immune activity  <cit> . immunoglobulin e  is an antibody isotype mediated by the th2-associated cytokine interleukin  <dig>  and important, and specific, in fighting against helminths  <cit> . immunoglobulin g, subtype b  is the most prevalent antibody isotype in equine serum  <cit> . while iggb is important in the protective response against intracellular pathogens, suggesting a th1-associated response, hooper-mcgrevy et al.  <cit>  found that iggb is likely a th2-related antibody in horses. antibodies against the protective antigen  toxin component of anthrax have been shown to be essential for adaptive protection against anthrax  <cit> . as a bacterial infection, anthrax provokes primarily a th <dig> type immune response  <cit> . ifn-γ is a key th <dig> cytokine that activates macrophages early in infection. il- <dig> is an important th <dig> cytokine that induces antibody isotype switching to ige and augments recruitment of eosinophils in response to the presence of helminths  <cit> .

we first compared data from only the first sampling events for animals between the two season types. this ensured that we were only comparing unique individuals, and their population-level effects, between seasons. we then did pairwise comparisons across the same animals, between seasons, for first and second captures only to examine individual level effects; this allowed us to account for individual-level variation that otherwise might have obscured patterns at the population level. we found highly statistically significant differences between seasons for gi parasites and eosinophil counts for both individual and population-level comparisons . iggb titers  were nearly significantly different between seasons at a population level, and were significantly different between seasons for individual-level comparisons; thus, our paired comparisons aided in elucidating patterns otherwise obscured by individual variation. similarly, ectoparasite counts were only significantly different between rain groups for individual-level comparisons . in addition, we found that both wbc counts and hct were significantly higher in the wet season for both population-level , and for individual-level comparisons .figure  <dig>

we found no statistically significant differences when comparing il- <dig> transcript ratios between seasons for all animals , or for first or paired captures . however, we found a mean  <dig> -fold increase in the mean transcript in the wet season in our population-level analysis. we found no statistically significant differences when comparing ifn-γ transcript ratios between seasons for all animals , or for first or paired captures . comparing mean ratios in the different seasons, however, we found a  <dig> -fold increase in transcript in the dry season in our population-level analysis. thus, we conclude that there is some evidence showing an increase in il- <dig> production during wetter times, and for an increase in ifn-γ production during drier times but more data are needed.

parasite coinfection models
in the best fitting gi parasite model, increased cumulative rainfall two months prior to sampling  significantly predicted higher gi parasite loads, as expected from seasonal analyses . however, higher eosinophil counts significantly predicted decreased gi parasite infection intensity . higher ige titer nearly significantly  predicted decreased gi parasite loads. while anti-pa titer was not statistically significant in the model, its negative coefficient suggests that higher magnitude anti-pa titers may be associated with lower gi parasite counts .table  <dig>

in the best fitting pa model, as rainfall increased, positive titer prevalence increased, and as eosinophil count increased, titer prevalence increased . the interaction term of rainfall with eosinophil count, however, was more highly statistically significant and negative, indicating that animals experiencing higher eosinophil counts were less likely to mount an anti-anthrax immune response than were animals with lower eosinophil counts during the wet  season. figure  <dig> illustrates that this negative relationship between eosinophils and anti-pa titer is strongly significant in the wet season , whereas the significantly positive relationship between anti-pa titer and eosinophil count observed in the pa gee model only holds for the dry season and at a less steep slope than that for the wet season relationships .figure  <dig>

immune interaction models
prior rainfall affected all immunity measures, with increased rainfall associated with increased eosinophils, monocytes, ige, and iggb titers . gi parasite counts were significantly, negatively associated with eosinophil counts, as was observed in the gi parasite gee model . while gi parasite counts and ectoparasite counts were not statistically significant in the ige model, they both showed a potentially negative association with ige titer. ifn-γ was significantly negatively associated with animals that had both high eosinophil counts and gi parasite infection intensities , and with animals that had both a high ige titer and increased gi parasite infection intensities . rainfall and eosinophil counts both significantly positively predicted monocyte counts; however, the interaction between rainfall and eosinophils, was significantly negatively associated with monocyte counts, indicating a complex interplay between these three variables. ige and iggb antibody titers both significantly negatively predicted monocyte counts, and monocytes were significantly, negatively correlated with iggb titers in the iggb model. relationships for immunity models are illustrated in figure 3c.

discussion
this study evaluated seasonality of infectious diseases and the seasonal interactions between concurrent infections and immunity in a natural, wet season anthrax-gi parasite system. we found evidence that gi helminth infection intensities, eosinophil counts, ige and iggb antibody titers, and possibly il- <dig> cytokine concentrations were increased in wet seasons. ectoparasite infestations and possibly ifn-γ cytokine concentrations were increased in dry seasons, and monocytes and anti-anthrax antibody titers were both negatively associated with interactions between rainfall and eosinophils. these patterns support the hypothesis that zebra experience th2-type increases in the wet season, that a th1-type of immunity may predominate in the dry season, and that th1-th <dig> trade-offs may exist in a natural system. we found evidence that this wet season th2-type immune increase is correlated primarily with gi parasite infections, which may affect anthrax infection dynamics at this time. we have therefore found preliminary evidence that one seasonally bound pathogen may be able to enforce seasonality on another pathogen through host immunomodulation.

seasonal immune resource allocation
the seasonal patterns in these immune parameters may partly reflect seasonal nutritional differences. higher hct in the wet season likely reflects a higher nutritional state, especially in light of the fact that dehydration often results in an elevated hct  <cit> ; the fact that hct in the wet season was still significantly higher than that of the more dehydrated animals in the dry season makes it likely that overall red blood cell numbers were even higher during periods of more rainfall. higher wbc in the wet season may also reflect this higher plane of nutrition, as may the higher total numbers of eosinophils and monocytes, and higher antibody titers. however, several of these immune parameters had complex relationships with rainfall, pathogen markers, and other immune factors, and thus simple seasonality and nutritional effects cannot completely account for these patterns.

several of the parasite and immune factors provide evidence that there may exist th1-th <dig> tradeoffs in zebra hosts. demonstrating such trade-offs in a natural system is powerful in that it helps to ground truth and support similar work previously conducted in controlled laboratory settings. our work in this natural system also allowed us to examine whether these trade-offs in nature can act in a temporal dimension, as we measured differential immune resource allocation in the wet versus the dry seasons.

as we expected from previous work  <cit> , gi parasite infection intensities were significantly higher in wetter seasons , likely due to increased survival of environmental life stages with increased moisture  <cit>  and adult worms delaying egg production until it is environmentally advantageous to produce eggs  <cit> . eosinophil counts were also significantly higher in the wetter seasons than in the drier ones, consistent with hosts, at a population level, fighting against new gi parasite infections during wetter conditions  <cit>  . other work in enp has found that zebra shed significantly more strongyle larvae during wetter seasons than in drier ones, lending further evidence of an overall, population-wide active immune response against new infections during the wet season . individually, we found a negative relationship between gi parasites and eosinophil counts . previous studies in wildlife have found a similar pattern, with a strongly negative association between gi helminth fecs and eosinophil counts, even when taking into account other host factors  <cit> . these findings suggest that individuals that are predisposed toward mounting stronger th <dig> responses  are more resistant to parasite infections, and thus exhibit lower fecs.

while total monocyte counts were significantly correlated with increased rainfall, they were significantly, negatively correlated with a rainfall-eosinophil interaction effect . this perhaps indicates that, while nutritional effects of the wet season may have increased host allocation to immune resources including monocytes, a trade-off between th2-type eosinophil responses and th1-type monocyte counts may be occurring. the fact that monocytes were significantly, negatively correlated with the th2-type immune factors ige and iggb titers further supports the hypothesis of a trade-off between these different arms of immunity.

ectoparasite counts were significantly higher in the drier seasons than in the wetter ones in paired samples but not in unique animal comparisons ; this provides evidence that individual susceptibility, likely mediated by immune responses and/or immunomodulation, was at least partly responsible for seasonal differences in ectoparasite infection intensities. previous studies have found that hard-bodied ticks in most systems prefer higher humidity and intermediate temperatures and are at their lowest numbers on hosts in very hot, dry seasons  <cit> . as ticks were actually less prevalent on enp zebras during what should have been their preferred season, this lends more evidence that immunomodulatory conditions influenced tick infestation of hosts.

iggb antibody titers were significantly greater in wetter seasons, but only for resampled animals, indicating that there are individual differences in immune allocation, immunomodulation, or both . while iggb is likely a th2-type antibody subtype in equids  <cit> , it is also the most prevalent antibody isotype in equine serum and is potentially involved in protection against other types of pathogens as well  <cit> . thus, while changes in iggb titers may in part reflect seasonal changes in gi parasite infection intensity in enp zebras, they may also be affected by other factors such as seasonal changes in host nutrition or reproduction.

il- <dig> is an instrumental component in protection against or the clearing of many helminth infections, with levels peaking soon following new parasite infections and falling a couple of months after infection attenuation  <cit> . while we had a small sample size and non-significant seasonal comparisons, we detected a 15-fold increase in mean il- <dig> signal in resampled animals while these animals were experiencing their highest gi parasite infection intensities, consistent with previous findings  <cit> . similarly, we observed drops in mean il- <dig> seen in the dry season as gi infection intensities waned. ifn-γ significantly decreases in the face of increased gi helminth infection intensity and increase after anthelminthic treatment  <cit> . though our sample size was small and seasonal comparisons were nonsignificant, our approximately twofold decrease in mean ifn-γ signal in wet seasons when hosts were experiencing peak new gi helminth infections compared to in the relatively parasite-depleted dry season supports previous findings  <cit> . in addition, the significantly negative association between ifn-γ signal and animals with high gi parasite infections in conjunction with either high eosinophil counts or ige titers lends support for opposing patterns between this th1-type cytokine and parasites and parasite related immune factors, as would be expected in a parasite driven th2-type immune skewing.

thus, the wet season eosinophil peak, combined with significantly higher iggb antibody titers and preliminary evidence for increased il- <dig> and decreased ifn-γ signaling at the same time provides evidence that host immune resources may be skewed toward a th2-type response in the wet season. the addition of significant inverse relationships between monocytes and iggb and ige antibody titers, and between monocytes and eosinophils during times of higher rain, support this hypothesis. the timing of these immune increases in conjunction with the timing of gi helminths infections that are known to affect immunity in a th <dig> positive manner suggests that these immune patterns are related to wet season new gi helminth infections. the significant drop in eosinophil counts and iggb titers in the dry season, coupled with preliminary evidence of increased ifn-γ signaling at that time supports the hypothesis that immunomodulation toward a th <dig> response by gi parasites may be attenuated when free-living gi parasite stages are less capable of survival and infecting new hosts.

correlates of coinfection with immunomodulatory effects
previous work in enp has demonstrated that ungulates ingest significantly more soil in the wet season, likely leading to increased exposure to b. anthracis at that time  <cit> . in support of this, we found that anti-pa titer prevalence was significantly, positively related to rainfall in the pa gee , likely reflecting this increased exposure to b. anthracis during the wet season, with a subsequent immune response if hosts are exposed to sublethal doses  <cit> . as we previously found evidence that mean time for negative seroconversion in titer-positive animals is less than six months  <cit> , we are confident that the rainfall-correlated immune signatures represent recent, seasonal b. anthracis exposure. this immune signature, coupled with the simultaneously significantly increased rates anthrax deaths supports the assertion that differential exposure to anthrax at least partly drives its seasonality in this system.

however, the wet season increase in th2-type immune resources observed in our system, in correlation with the timing of peak anthrax incidence, suggests that hosts may also experience seasonally increased anthrax susceptibility shortly following periods of peak gi helminth infection intensity due, at least in part, to immunomodulatory effects and immune tradeoffs. th2-type skewing by helminths has been found to have significant consequences for hosts fighting against concurrent microparasitic infections  <cit> . in support of this assertion, we also found indirect evidence  that decreased anti-pa titers were correlated with increased gi parasite infection intensities, and vice versa . thus, as gi parasite numbers increase, hosts may be less likely to mount a humoral immune response against anthrax. the significant, negative relationship between the rainfall/eosinophils interaction term and anti-pa titer prevalence in the pa gee model further supports the hypothesis that this anti-anthrax immune attenuation may be related to gi parasite immunomodulation even in the face of increased anthrax exposure. these anthrax-th <dig> immunity relationships held only for the wet season when gi parasite infection intensities were highest . similar directional tradeoffs were observed in studies of concurrent gi helminth and tuberculosis infections in buffalo  <cit> .

the lack of a stronger, directly negative relationship between gi parasite infection intensity and anti-pa titer magnitude may be due to the ability of animals that ingest low levels of b. anthracis in the wet season to mount at least a minor th1-type immune response, even in the face of strong th2-skewing. potian et al.  <cit>  found that mice coinfected with gi helminths and lung tuberculosis bacteria were able to mount both th <dig> and th <dig> responses, respectively, to these pathogens, but only once the parasites colonized separate organs. as animals ingesting very high doses of b. anthracis spores are more likely to develop subacute fulminant infection and die  <cit> , animals that have measurable anti-anthrax titers are even more likely to be individuals who experienced low infectious doses while mounting a measureable th <dig> response against an established th2-type skewing. animals that experience high gi parasite infections and large anthrax doses are also likely at much greater risk for mortality, thus effectively removing very helminth-susceptible and coinfected animals from this study  but still benefiting anthrax transmission  <cit> . as we were not able to sample anthrax carcasses for gi parasite and immune parameters, our results may be biased against accurately measuring those animals that succumbed to anthrax due to macroparasite th2-type skewing.

while studies suggest that ectoparasites are more active in parasitizing hosts during milder and more humid times, ectoparasite infection intensities in our study were both higher on hosts in the dry season in rain group comparisons and were significantly, negatively associated with rainfall in gee models . interestingly, higher gi parasite infection intensities were significantly associated with higher ectoparasite counts, despite the opposite interaction of ectoparasites with rainfall . several studies suggest that a th1-type immune response is most effective against tick infestations and that ticks can suppress this response in favor of a less effective th2-type skewing  <cit> . however, our study suggests that a th2-type immune response is actually more effective in fighting against tick infestations, the more so because otherwise the combination of preferred environmental conditions coupled with a strong th <dig> skewing would be expected to result in very high tick burdens in the wet season. as hard-bodied ticks are more capable of survival during dry seasons than are desiccation-prone gi helminth free-living stages  <cit> , the increase in tick infestations in the dry season may represent ticks taking advantage of a decrease in gi parasite-driven th <dig> immune pressure at this time. the directionality of these interactions, with gi parasites potentially driving a th2-type immune response and indirectly affecting ectoparasites, is supported by the fact that rare major histocompatibility complex  alleles were found to be associated with increased gi parasite infection intensities, and common alleles with increased ectoparasites in enp zebras  <cit> . this suggests that gi parasites exert stronger selective pressure at the gene locus in question than do ectoparasites, with gi parasites having higher fitness costs to hosts and likely driving host immune allocation in this system.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we measured a complex, interacting set of host-parasite variables that, taken together, support the hypothesis that enp zebra allocate more immune resources toward a th2-type of immune response in the wet season, while a th1-type immunity may prevail in the drier seasons. this th2-type allocation is likely primarily driven by gi parasite infections, which show strong seasonal fluctuations primarily constrained by external environmental effects on free-living parasite stages. this study is, to our knowledge, one of the first to examine seasonal th1-th <dig> trade-offs in a natural system.

increased eosinophil counts during wet seasons likely represent an active, and partly successful, immune response against primarily new gi parasite infections. as the interaction between rainfall and eosinophil counts is significantly, negatively correlated with anti-anthrax adaptive immune responses, this may provide evidence for the immunomodulatory effects of gi parasite infections on anthrax susceptibility. as zebra hosts experience significantly increased gi helminth infection intensities and evidence for th2-type immune resource allocation shortly prior to the population's annual anthrax outbreaks, this suggests that anti-parasite th <dig> responses may make hosts less capable of mounting effective th1-type immune responses against anthrax infections at this time. this increase in susceptibility, combined with evidence of increased b. anthracis exposure  during the wet season, could be a driver of anthrax outbreaks in this system. thus, our findings suggest that, through immunomodulation, seasonally constrained pathogens could help force seasonality on other pathogens that are, on their own, not as temporally driven. in addition, by examining the interaction between two environmentally transmitted pathogens, our findings also suggest that certain pathogens can bridge the gap between external and internal ecosystems; through immunomodulatory effects, gi parasites in this system may influence the external ecosystem by altering bacillus anthracis dynamics. while our study is correlative in nature and therefore speculative, this work represents an important first step in understanding the seasonal interplay between macro- and microparasites in a natural system and will hopefully lead to further explorations of these relationships. these findings have important implications both for understanding and predicting anthrax outbreaks, and for understanding the increasingly complex ways in which pathogens can influence hosts, each other, and greater ecosystems.
