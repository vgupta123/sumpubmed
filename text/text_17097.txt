BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis  is among the most common sexually transmitted pathogens in the us and contributes to many conditions, such as pelvic inflammatory disease  <cit> , infertility  <cit> , and others  <cit> . c. trachomatis has a small genome, ~ <dig>  mb, and like viruses  depend on the host cell for survival  <cit> . the chlamydial life cycle exhibits two forms that are relevant to chlamydial pathology. the elementary body  is a ‘spore-like’ infectious form, previously perceived as metabolically inert but recently shown to display maintenance level of metabolic activity  <cit> . following internalization into the host cells, ebs initiate the inclusion formation and transform into metabolically active reticulate bodies , which then replicate within the inclusion. during the time course of rb replication, the early inclusions expand and fuse to form the early-mid inclusion, which then further expands into the mid-late inclusion. at this stage the rbs are converted back into ebs and are then released from the host cells through extrusion or cell lysis  <cit> . the process of c. trachomatis development from attachment/entry to extrusion/exit, is regulated by an arsenal of c. trachomatis and host cell proteins  <cit> . for example, several groups reported the recruitment of tyrosine-phosphorylated host cell proteins at the site of c. trachomatis entry into the host cell  <cit>  and the requirement of actin polymerization along the time course of infection  <cit> . in accordance with this, previous studies have shown that chlamydia muridarum , a species closely related to c. trachomatis, induces activation of two host cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases: the fibroblast growth factor receptor , and the platelet derived growth factor receptor β   <cit> . fgfr and pdgfrβ have been proposed to be important for binding of the chlamydial ebs to the host cell. elwell and co-workers have shown that pdgfrβ is phosphorylated upon c. muridarum infection and can function as a receptor for bacterial binding to the host cell. a function for pdgfr activation beyond this stage was not reported  <cit> . in an elegant study performed by kim et al., it was shown that c. muridarum recruits fgf <dig> signaling to enhance infection and bacterial spread  <cit> . in this case, fgf <dig> acts as a bridging molecule between the ebs and the receptor that results in the activation of fgfr and bacterial uptake in the host cells.

the question therefore arises whether some of the other receptor tyrosine kinases play a similar function in the bacterial uptake or have functions that extend beyond this initial stage of bacterial infection. of particular interest to our research is the epidermal growth factor receptor , the activation and overexpression of which has been linked to malignant transformation and progression of a broad variety of cancers  <cit> . with respect to cancer, similar studies have shown that infection with c. trachomatis may contribute to malignant transformation as a co-factor with hpv or independent of hpv  <cit> . moreover, fischer et al. have shown in clinical studies an association between egfr expression and c. trachomatis infection in women with intraepithelial neoplasia and with invasive carcinoma of the cervix  <cit> . the involvement of egfr in chlamydial infection has been further shown in chlamydia pneumoniae , in which the protein pmp <dig> binds to and activates egfr to facilitate host cell entry  <cit> . a function of egfr beyond entry was however not established. increased activity of egfr was also observed in a number of other infectious diseases. zhang et al. have studied the function of host cell egfr for pseudomonas aeruginosa in which they show that, during infection, the activity of egfr is enhanced followed by up-regulation of the downstream pi3k and erk1/ <dig> pathway  <cit> . significant changes in the levels and activity of host signaling molecules like akt, erk1/ <dig> and the downstream bad protein during the developmental cycle of chlamydia have also been reported  <cit> . similarly, swanson et al. have shown an enhanced neisseria gonorrhoeae-induced activity of egfr, which facilitated the gonococcal invasion  <cit> .

egfr signaling is also an important regulator of cytoskeleton remodeling in cells  <cit>  and, over the years, several research groups have put forward the significance of host cytoskeletal rearrangement in the chlamydial development cycle  <cit> . interestingly, egfr has an f-actin binding domain   <cit> , that is not present in pdgfrβ or fgfr. the functional consequence of the interaction between egfr and the actin cytoskeleton is complex with recent evidence suggesting a role for the f-actin organization in egfr dimer formation and polarized response to growth factor stimulation  <cit> .

altogether, the evidence brought about by the studies summarized above has prompted us to investigate the potential significance of host cell egfr in c. trachomatis development and progression of c. trachomatis-associated diseases. we provide here the evidence identifying egfr signaling as the first host cell receptor pathway required for c. trachomatis development within the host cell. our data show: a) distinct functional requirements of egfr versus pdgfr during c. trachomatis infection - we demonstrate that pdgfr is critical only at the step of bacterial attachment, and that knockdown of egfr but not pdgfr impairs development of c. trachomatis inclusions within the host cell; b) infection with c. trachomatis increases phosphorylation of egfr and of its downstream effectors plcγ <dig>  akt and stat5; c) c. trachomatis infection results in re-localization of egfr at the periphery of c. trachomatis inclusion inside the host cell; and d) inhibition of egfr results in the formation of a diffuse assembly of f-actin at the periphery of incompletely developed inclusions. co-localization of egfr with f-actin at the periphery of c. trachomatis inclusion is a particularly exciting and novel finding implicating egfr in the regulation of actin polymerization around c. trachomatis inclusions.

RESULTS
c. trachomatis induces egfr phosphorylation and activation of egfr signaling pathways
to assess the role of egfr in c. trachomatis development, we initiated our studies by comparing the chlamydial inclusion formation between isogenic cell lines, mefs egfr+/+  and egfr null mefs . both cell lines were infected with chlamydial ebs and at  <dig> hours post infection  the cells were stained with chlamydial fitc-conjugated anti-lipopolysaccharide  mab as described in the methods. confocal imaging was performed to visualize the development of chlamydial inclusions. well-developed c. trachomatis inclusions were observed in mefs egfr+/+ while in the mefs egfr−/− cells, the inclusions were significantly smaller in size in comparison to mefs egfr+/+ . these initial results indicated a role of egfr in c. trachomatis infection and prompted us to explore it further. we first examined whether c. trachomatis could induce egfr phosphorylation in infected cells. to ensure the results were not biased by the selection of cell line, both hela cells and mefs egfr+/+ were used in these experiments. the mefs egfr+/+ cells were infected with chlamydial ebs and lysed at different time points ranging from  <dig>  hpi to  <dig> hpi. we observed a significant  <dig> -fold increase in phosphorylation of y <dig> in egfr that peaked at  <dig>  hpi  . similar results were obtained in hela cells , in which we also observed an increase in pdgfrβ phosphorylation . we further analyzed the phosphorylation of egfr at other tyrosine residues . an increased phosphorylation was observed in c. trachomatis-infected mefs egfr+/+  at all sites analyzed with the exception of y <dig> . the results show that c. trachomatis can enhance egfr activity and predicts a function of egfr signaling in c. trachomatis infection.figure  <dig>

 and hela  with and without chlamydial infection were lysed at different hpi as indicated and immunoblotted with antibodies against py1173-egfr and egfr antibodies. the immunoblots from three independent experiments were quantified for both mefs  and hela cells  after normalization with β-actin used as loading control. a significant increase  in phosphorylation of egfr in mefs egfr+/+
 and hela cells  was observed at  <dig>  hpi.  hela cells with and without chlamydial infection were lysed at  <dig>  hpi. two biological replicates were subjected to immunoblotting for ppdgfrβ  and β-actin as loading control. an increase in pdgfrβ phosphorylation was observed in c. trachomatis-infected cells compared with non-infected cells.  mefs egfr+/+ were infected with c. trachomatis for  <dig>  h or  <dig> h. western blotting was performed for comparing egfr phosphorylation by c. trachomatis at various tyrosine residues. c. trachomatis induced phosphorylation was observed at all sites analyzed with the exception of y <dig> site.

egfr activation in response to extracellular cues  is known to activate pi3k/akt, plcγ <dig>  and stat proteins   <cit> . to determine whether c. trachomatis-induced egfr phosphorylation can also activate its downstream effector proteins, the phosphorylation of plcγ <dig> , akt  and stat <dig>  was monitored in mefs egfr+/+ and egfr−/− cells infected with chlamydial ebs at time points ranging from  <dig>  hpi to  <dig> hpi. as shown in figure 3a and the quantification in figure 3b, c. trachomatis infection induced a significant increase in phosphorylation of egfr and its downstream targets, plcγ <dig>  akt and stat <dig> at  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . at  <dig> hpi, the phosphorylation of egfr, akt and plcγ <dig> returned close to the basal level. interestingly, the phosphorylation of stat <dig> persisted at  <dig> hpi, presumably due to delayed kinetics or secondary activation subsequent to primary stimulus, an aspect that will be investigated in future studies. the egfr dependence of these phosphorylation events was further confirmed by the experiments in mefs egfr−/− cells. under these conditions, c. trachomatis infection at the same time points did not induce an increase in phosphorylation of plcγ <dig>  akt and stat <dig> proteins . combined with our previous observation of phenotypically smaller inclusions formed in mefs egfr−/− cells , these findings led us to hypothesize that activation of an egfr-dependent signaling axis was essential for establishing a successful c. trachomatis infection. to further confirm that the activation of these proteins was c. trachomatis- and egfr-dependent, we investigated the c. trachomatis-induced activation of plcγ <dig>  stat <dig> and akt in mef egfr+/+ and hela cells using multiple methods of egfr inhibition. mefs egfr+/+ cells were treated with egfr sirna for  <dig> h, then infected with c. trachomatis for  <dig>  h and tested for activation of plcγ <dig>  stat <dig> and akt. chlamydial infection resulted in increased phosphorylation of all three proteins in cells treated with control sirna but not in cells treated with egfr sirna . c. trachomatis-induced phosphorylation of egfr, plcγ <dig>  stat <dig> and akt was also inhibited by treatment of hela and mefs egfr+/+ with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of egfr and specifically blocks egfr functions . these studies confirmed egfr activation as one of the upstream regulatory events in the phosphorylation of plcγ <dig>  stat <dig> and akt signaling in c. trachomatis-infected cells.figure  <dig>

egfr is essential for the formation of mature chlamydial inclusions
next, we assessed the contribution of egfr to the formation of c. trachomatis inclusions in hela cells and mefs. egfr was inhibited by using erlotinib, cetuximab or egfr sirna. erlotinib is a small molecule inhibitor that targets the intracellular kinase domain of egfr, while cetuximab blocks the binding of egf to its cognate receptor and thus blocks receptor activation  <cit> . effective inhibition of egfr phosphorylation by erlotinib or cetuximab was confirmed by western blot . similarly, western blot analysis was performed to confirm the depletion of egfr protein in hela and mefs treated with egfr sirna . hela cells with or without egfr inhibition , were infected with c. trachomatis. the cells were immunostained using anti-chlamydial lps mab at  <dig> hpi and analyzed by confocal imaging to quantify the size and number of inclusions. in comparison to control , there was a significant decrease in both the number and size of chlamydial inclusions under all treatment conditions . use of multiple approaches to inhibit egfr discounts the possibility of observing these results because of an unspecific interaction of the inhibitors with non-target molecules, a potential caveat of using pharmacological agents  <cit> . the decreased chlamydial infection upon egfr inhibition was further confirmed by monitoring the chlamydial hsp <dig> using western blot analysis . to ensure that erlotinib and cetuximab treatments did not affect the viability of chlamydial ebs, we infected hela cells with ebs that were pretreated with erlotinib or cetuximab. at  <dig> hpi the cells were lysed and blotted using antibodies against chlamydial hsp <dig>  the hsp <dig> antigen load in the cells infected with drug-treated ebs was comparable to the infection by the untreated ebs , confirming that egfr inhibitors did not affect the viability of ebs in these experiments. additional studies were performed to ensure that the poor inclusion development was not due to loss of the host cells’ viability during erlotinib treatment. the highest concentration  and maximum duration  of erlotinib treatment did not reduce the viability of hela cells .

because we observed pdgfrβ phosphorylation triggered by c. trachomatis infection  and the role of pdgfrβ has been established in c. muridarum attachment to host cells  <cit> , we also investigated the formation of chlamydial inclusions in cells treated with pdgfrβ sirna. the depletion of pdgfrβ in hela cells treated with pdgfrβ sirna was confirmed by western blot . similar to egfr, depletion of pdgfrβ decreased the number of inclusions in host cells ; however, unlike egfr, the size of the inclusions was not significantly affected by pdgfrβ sirna treatment . these results were further substantiated by experiments in mefs egfr−/− cells, which showed similar results to the egfr-inhibited hela cells . we then examined the possible role of egfr in the bacterial attachment to the cell surface and its subsequent internalization, during the early stage of c. trachomatis infection. the pdgfrβ sirna treated hela cells were included as control in these experiments. hela cells with or without egfr and pdgfrβ inhibition were infected with c. trachomatis for  <dig>  h and processed for inside-out staining to differentially quantify external and internalized bacteria. at  <dig>  hpi a significant decrease in cell-associated bacteria  was observed  in both egfr and pdgfrβ inhibited cells . since more than 80% of the cell-associated bacteria were successfully internalized into the host cell , these results point to defects in bacterial attachment to the host cell as a main cause for the decrease in overall chlamydial internalization. the results were further confirmed by western blot analysis of chlamydial hsp <dig> .

the small inclusions formed upon inhibition of egfr were examined in detail by transmission electron microscopy experiments. large inclusions were observed in hela cells infected with c. trachomatis whereas the erlotinib and cetuximab treated hela cells contained small inclusions .

to further distinguish between the role of egfr in bacterial attachment from the growth-associated consequences during c. trachomatis infection, experiments were performed in which egfr inhibitor  was added at different time points , post bacterial infection. under all conditions the total time of infection with c. trachomatis was  <dig> h. egfr inhibition after  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi, impaired regular inclusion formation and resulted in formation of numerous bacterial aggregates . on the other hand, egfr inhibition at  <dig> hpi did not significantly affect the inclusion development . these observations correlate well with the pattern of egfr signaling shown in figure 3a and b. the results were further confirmed by western blot analysis of chlamydial hsp <dig>  significantly lower expression of hsp <dig> was noted in cells treated with erlotinib at  <dig>  hpi compared with erlotinib addition at  <dig> hpi . together, the results described above show that egfr has discrete functions both at the level of bacterial attachment/internalization and subsequent inclusion development.figure  <dig>

egfr regulates intracellular calcium during c. trachomatis infection
the electron micrographs of the inclusions formed in egfr-inhibited cells  were reminiscent of previously reported type of inclusions formed upon inhibition of calcium binding protein calmodulin  <cit> . since egfr is known to regulate cellular calcium response and calcium signaling is pivotal for numerous bacterial infections  <cit> , we next tested whether egfr could be involved in c. trachomatis-induced calcium release in host cells. hela cells were treated with control sirna, egfr sirna or pdgfrβ sirna followed by c. trachomatis infection. at  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for intracellular calcium. at  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi, a significant increase in calcium was observed upon c. trachomatis infection in control sirna and pdgfrβ sirna treated cells but not in egfr sirna treated cells . in another set of experiments, erlotinib was added at  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi and cells were incubated for up to  <dig> hpi when they were stained for calcium. a significant drop in calcium signal was observed in c. trachomatis-infected cells that had been treated with erlotinib at  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi . examination of these results in combination with the observations described in figure  <dig>  suggest that egfr-induced calcium release is necessary for the development of c. trachomatis inclusions. next, we mimicked a calcium deficient environment by treating hela cells with the calcium chelator bapta/am for  <dig> h followed by c. trachomatis infection for  <dig> h. a significant decrease in both inclusion size and number was noted, similar to the conditions of egfr inhibition in hela cells . impaired inclusion formation was also observed in c. trachomatis-infected cells treated with bapta/am at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi  compared with the control dmso treated cells . intriguingly, the addition of ionomycin  to egfr sirna treated cells was not able to rescue the formation of chlamydial inclusion . this shows that a coordinated and synchronized regulation of egfr-dependent calcium release along with other factors regulated by egfr are required for formation of inclusions within the host cells. we hypothesized that one of these factors could be f-actin; the reasoning and experiments to address this hypothesis are described next.figure  <dig>

egfr is essential for f-actin assembly around chlamydial inclusions
cytoskeletal elements like f-actin and intermediate filaments have been shown to form a dynamically regulated scaffold around the chlamydial inclusions  <cit> . interestingly, a unique feature of egfr that is not present in other receptor tyrosine kinases  is the presence of an f-actin binding domain involved in the internalization of activated egfr  <cit> . independent studies have implicated egf-induced plcγ <dig> activation in both calcium mobilization and cytoskeleton remodeling  <cit> . our results demonstrate egfr-dependent plcγ <dig> activation and calcium mobilization upon c. trachomatis infection . to examine the role of egfr in arrangement of f-actin at the inclusion periphery, hela cells treated with erlotinib, cetuximab, and egfr sirna were infected with c. trachomatis for  <dig> h and processed for confocal microscopy to visualize the intracellular arrangement of f-actin. we observed formation of a distinct f-actin ring at the inclusion periphery in c. trachomatis infected control cells  . in the egfr sirna treated cells, the arrangement of f-actin around the c. trachomatis inclusion was either diffused or disorganized . similar results were observed in the erlotinib and cetuximab treated hela cells , as well as in the mefs egfr−/− cells .figure  <dig>

since egfr is an f-actin binding protein, we performed additional experiments to investigate whether egfr co-localizes with f-actin ring at the periphery of inclusion. hela cells were infected with c. trachomatis and at  <dig> hpi the cells were stained for c. trachomatis eb, egfr and f-actin . co-localization of egfr and f-actin at the periphery of c. trachomatis inclusion was evidenced by overlapping fluorescence signals . the normalized mean deviation product   <cit>  was calculated for each pixel in the image to identify regions of intense co-localization or exclusion within the image. the resulting nmdp color maps of the whole cell and the inclusion area  show areas with co-localization ranging from moderate to intense, with no areas of exclusion . the intensity profile for a cross-section in figure 8a, which includes from top left to bottom right  shows clear enrichment of egfr and f-actin at the periphery of inclusion as well as the cell membrane . quantitative processing of the image data shown in figure  <dig> was performed using a number of independent algorithms  <cit> , which are described in the legend for additional file 3: figures s14-s <dig>  similar analysis was applied to other  <dig> inclusion areas and  <dig> non-inclusion areas  and all five parameters show significant increase of egfr and f-actin co-localization in inclusion areas compared with non-inclusion areas . additional representative images and analyses are shown in additional file 3: figures s15- <dig>  collectively, all quantitative analyses show strong and statistically significant evidence of co-localization of egfr and f-actin at the periphery of inclusion.figure  <dig>

discussion
as an intracellular pathogen, c. trachomatis has developed an arsenal of molecular tools that enables it to hijack signaling and metabolic pathways of the host cell and establish an intracellular niche favorable to its development. an extensive network of interactions exists between c. trachomatis and host proteins to facilitate bacterial attachment and entry and c. trachomatis development in the host cell. c. trachomatis can interact with and modulate the activity of numerous cell surface receptors to promote attachment and entry into the host cell. egfr is an important cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase with a central role in cell growth, proliferation and migration  <cit> . the function of egfr was studied in a number of bacterial and viral infections ; however, it has not been thoroughly investigated in relation to c. trachomatis pathogenesis. we provide here the first evidence that c. trachomatis has the ability to upregulate egfr activity in host cells and establish egfr as a critical effector molecule in the formation of chlamydial inclusions within the host cells.

we demonstrate that c. trachomatis induces an increase in egfr phosphorylation and that inhibition of egfr phosphorylation or depletion of egfr protein impairs c. trachomatis attachment and its development in the host cells. in  <dig>  elwell et al. analyzed both pdgfrβ and egfr phosphorylation in hela cells infected with c. muridarum  <cit> . while there was an increased phosphorylation of pdgfrβ, a change in phosphorylation of egfr was not observed in this study. the discrepancy in results could be due to differences in the time points  investigated, moi and chlamydia species. our results are further supported by the egfr-dependent increase in phosphorylation of downstream targets like akt, stat <dig> and plcγ <dig> in c. trachomatis infected cells. phosphorylation of akt during chlamydial infection is well documented  <cit>  and previous studies reported that activation of the pi3k/akt pathway blocks the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and delays apoptosis thereby promoting chlamydial growth and survival inside the host cell  <cit> . the lack of akt phosphorylation in egfr−/− cells demonstrates egfr as the upstream regulator of akt phosphorylation, which was not known before. with respect to stat <dig> activation, a recent report showed that the interaction of egfr with stat <dig> in the nucleus could lead to activation of aurora-a gene expression  <cit> , and subsequent chromosomal instability. interestingly, c. trachomatis infection was previously linked to centrosome defects  <cit> . thus, a mechanistic connection could exist between c. trachomatis-induced activation of egfr and stat <dig> and the centrosome abnormalities observed in c. trachomatis infections; this remains to be investigated.

in this study, we have followed-up on egfr-dependent activation of plcγ <dig>  it is well known that egf binding to egfr results in activation of plcγ <dig>  the subsequent production of ip <dig> is linked to activation of ip <dig> receptor  and intracellular calcium mobilization  <cit> . there is extensive evidence that links egfr activation to this process  <cit>  and we demonstrate here that inhibition of egfr abrogates the c. trachomatis-induced increase in intracellular calcium flux. also, removal of calcium by chelation resulted in marked reduction in the size and number of chlamydial inclusion similar to egfr inhibition. this is consistent with previous studies, which have reported localization of intracellular calcium stores and regulators of calcium release and uptake  in the vicinity of c. trachomatis inclusions and formation of immature inclusions upon inhibition of calcium binding proteins like calmodulin  <cit> . however, the failure to restore c. trachomatis inclusion development by addition of a calcium ionophore  indicated that other egfr-regulated processes might contribute to c. trachomatis inclusion development in conjunction with calcium.

c. trachomatis is known to utilize cytoskeletal elements like f-actin and intermediate filaments to form a dynamically regulated scaffold that maintains the structural integrity of the chlamydial inclusions  <cit> . a unique feature of egfr that distinguishes it from pdgfrβ is its ability to regulate actin polymerization through its f-actin binding domain. egfr and f-actin interaction was previously reported to play an active role in egfr internalization and has been proposed to localize egfr signaling at specific loci within the cell  <cit> . our data show distinct co-localization of egfr with the f-actin ring around the chlamydial inclusion and interruption in the formation of f-actin rings around the chlamydial inclusions in both calcium depleted and egfr inhibited cells. these results are consistent with the function of plcγ <dig> and calcium mobilization in cytoskeletal remodeling  <cit> . rho family of small gtpases has also been reported to participate in the egfr-dependent regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling  <cit>  and previous findings have shown recruitment of these molecules at the inclusion periphery  <cit>  therefore, egfr interaction with f-actin may function to nucleate the assembly of signaling protein complexes for cytoskeletal remodeling required for inclusion development.

egfr-dependent regulation of f-actin and calcium release can affect inclusion formation at multiple stages of c. trachomatis infection. first, it can have a direct effect on the bacterial attachment and entry. consistent with this, our data indicate that egfr inhibition significantly impairs the bacterial attachment to the host cell surface at a level comparable with inhibition of pdgfrβ. recently, molleken et al. demonstrated that egfr inhibition  reduced c. pneumoniae eb internalization to hep- <dig> cells but did not affect eb attachment  <cit> . the discrepancy could be due to differences in the chlamydia species, host cell lines and the dose and type of egfr inhibitors used in these studies. nevertheless, the defect in bacterial attachment seen in our studies could be due to the inability to bind to egfr and/or the defective egfr signaling. since erlotinib, as an egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor, does not directly compete with c. trachomatis for binding to egfr, our results suggest that c. trachomatis attachment is not only mediated by its binding to egfr, but also facilitated by the downstream signaling events. early events of c. trachomatis infection  involve accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins at the site of entry  <cit> , cytoskeletal remodeling and reorganization of microvilli at the cellular surface for c. trachomatis uptake  <cit> . we propose that c. trachomatis-activated egfr can trigger changes in cytoskeletal rearrangement and microvilli extensions that favor c. trachomatis attachment and entry. whether egfr activation is the direct result of ebs binding to the extracellular domain of egfr or occurs indirectly , it remains to be investigated in future studies. alternatively, reduced c. trachomatis attachment to erlotinib-treated host cells could be due to changes in egfr subcellular localization or egfr affinity to its ligand. however, in our imaging studies, we did not detect any significant changes in egfr cell surface localization in the presence of erlotinib, consistent with another report  <cit> . although other egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors  have been shown to alter egfr interaction with its ligand  <cit> , whether erlotinib could change the affinity of egfr to its ligand remains to be investigated. however, the molleken et al. studies, which used ag <dig> would suggest that this mechanism is unlikely and that the attachment of ebs to host cell is impaired by inhibition of egfr downstream signaling. it should be noted that entry of c. trachomatis in the host cell could use multiple routes. our data supports this statement since independent inhibitions of either egfr or pdgfrβ affect the bacterial attachment and neither of the two receptors can compensate for the other. the second stage at which egfr can control the inclusion development is at the local aggregation of c. trachomatis inside the cell. in fact, experiments in which egfr was inhibited post chlamydial invasion, showed decreased intracellular calcium  as well as numerous bacterial aggregates , perhaps stalled at the stage of fusion of bacterial inclusions. as discussed above, a number of studies have indicated a role of calcium in aggregation of c. trachomatis and f-actin rearrangement  <cit> . the egfr-dependent regulation of calcium and f-actin not only provides the dynamic structural scaffold for the expanding inclusion but can also aid in the nutrient uptake required for replicating bacteria since the f-actin and microtubules are known to be essential for vesicular trafficking and intracellular motility  <cit> . interference with the f-actin arrangements by inhibiting egfr can therefore impair the maturation of chlamydial inclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the studies included here show that chlamydial infection upregulates egfr activity in host cells. this results in activation of downstream effectors of egfr such as plcγ <dig>  akt and stat <dig>  we demonstrate that egfr and egfr-mediated signaling play a critical role in both c. trachomatis attachment and development of c. trachomatis inclusions in host cells through mechanisms that involve egfr-dependent regulation of calcium release, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and egfr co-localization with f-actin at the inclusion periphery. these findings shed light on the complexity of c. trachomatis-host cell interactions, which when solved may open new venues to treat c. trachomatis infections and c. trachomatis-associated diseases. these results form the basis of the model we propose in figure  <dig>  which will be further evaluated in the future. in this model, egfr plays a key role in the early and middle stages of c. trachomatis infection wherein the egfr mediated calcium signaling and f-actin remodeling are central to the establishment of a successful c. trachomatis infection inside the eukaryotic cells. the model shows the direct activation of egfr by ebs binding, but as discussed above other mechanisms are possible and warrant investigation.figure  <dig>

infection.
c. trachomatis infection induces egfr phosphorylation and activation of downstream targets like akt, stat <dig> and plcγ <dig>  the direct activation of egfr by ebs binding to the extracellular domain of egfr is shown here but other indirect mechanisms of egfr activation are possible as well. activation of egfr signaling can upregulate host cell survival mechanisms and induce increased calcium mobilization. egfr co-localization with f-actin is suggestive of a possible direct role of egfr in formation of f-actin rings at the periphery of inclusion. the increased calcium signaling can have several functions ranging from cytoskeletal remodeling to recruitment of host proteins at the inclusion membrane. the egfr-induced formation of f-actin ring and other cytoskeletal elements at the inclusion periphery can further aid in inclusion expansion via vesicular trafficking and nutrient uptake.
