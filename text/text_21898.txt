BACKGROUND
ischemic stroke is a major cause of neurological disability and a big burden on the family and society. regaining function can significantly reduce dependence and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors. ischemic stroke has a very complex pathophysiology. in addition to irreversible neuronal damage, ischemia also triggers cellular processes for neuronal repair involving remaining neurons. apoptosis and necrosis are two vital types of cell death in ischemic brain injury  <cit> . recently, autophagic cell death has been reported as a third type of cell death in ischemic tissue  <cit> . autophagy is a lysosomal pathway for recycling of organelles and long-lived proteins  <cit> . in the course of autophagy, autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles, are formed to sequester cytoplasmic constituents  <cit> . the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to digest the contents for recycling. physiologically, autophagy plays a key role in adapting to nutritional deprivation and eliminating aggregated proteins  <cit> . however, inappropriate activation of autophagy may lead to cell death in cerebral ischemia  <cit> . although it is unclear whether autophagy prevents or contributes to apoptotic cell death, the interaction between autophagy-related and apoptosis-related proteins, suggests an interplay between apoptosis and autophagy  <cit> . on the other hand, stroke also induces neurogenesis  <cit> . it has been reported that newborn neurons can contribute to functional recovery after stroke  <cit> . interestingly, down-regulation of either autophagy or apoptosis can increase neurogenesis after stroke  <cit> . therefore, the functional outcome may be resulted from a complex interplay among autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis following cerebral ischemia.

previously, we and others have demonstrated that physical exercise can improve functional recovery after stroke  <cit> . the protective effects of physical exercise are partially associated with enhancement of neurogenesis and attenuation of apoptosis  <cit> . it is necessary to investigate the effects of physical exercise on neuronal proliferation and death. although it has been proved that physical exercise can mitigate autophagy and enhance functional recovery after myocardial infarction in animals  <cit> , the role of autophagy in exercise-induced functional recovery after stroke remains elusive. growth factors such as igf- <dig> also have benefitial effects on exercise-induced functional recovery in cerebral ischemia  <cit> . it is also reported that up-regulation of igf- <dig> expression mitigates autophagy in some conditions  <cit> . consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of physical exercise on ischemia-induced autophagy, apoptosis, neurogenesis and igf- <dig> in the peri-infarct region after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion  in rats.

in this study, we demonstrated that physical exercise could mitigate autophagosome accumulation, attenuate apoptosis, promote neurogenesis and igf- <dig> expression in the peri-infarct region, thus improving the functional recovery.

RESULTS
physical exercise improved functional recovery
the effects of physical exercise on neurological function were evaluated using modified neurological severity score  scale. the mnss were  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days in the exercise groups after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the mnss were  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days in the control group after mcao, respectively. the repeated measures anova revealed a significant main effect of mnss  at  <dig>  and  <dig>  days, an significant interaction between treatment effects and time effects at  <dig>  and  <dig>  days and a significant time effect at  <dig>  and  <dig>  days. but there was no significant difference between two groups at  <dig> days  after mcao. non-parametric analysis revealed that the mnss values at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days were much lower than those in control group at  <dig> days , indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao.

there was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure, rectal temperature, arterial blood gas values, glucose levels and body weight .

physical exercise reduced the volume of the infarct area
the relative infarct volumes were  <dig>  %± <dig> % at  <dig> days in basal control group after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were  <dig> %± <dig> % and  <dig> %± <dig> % in physical exercise and control group at  <dig> days after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were  <dig> %± <dig> % and  <dig> %± <dig> % at  <dig> and  <dig> days in the physical exercise group after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the relative infarct volumes were  <dig> %± <dig> % and  <dig> % ± <dig> % at  <dig> and  <dig> days in the control group after mcao, respectively. in control group, the infarct volumes were significantly smaller at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days than those at  <dig> days after mcao , indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao. compared with control group, physical exercise significantly reduced the infarct volumes at  <dig>  and  <dig> days  but not at  <dig> days  after mcao . interestingly, the attenuation of mnss was positively correlated with the reduction of infarct volumes . these findings suggest that physical exercise reduces brain damage and improves neurological function.

physical exercise mitigated autophagosomes accumulation and attenuated apoptosis in the peri-infarct region
to examine the involvement of autophagosomes, immunostaining was performed using an antibody against lc <dig>  there are two forms of lc3—the cytosolic  and membrane-bound  forms. upon induction of autophagy, the cytosolic lc3-i is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form lc3-ii and the latter then translocates to the newly formed autophagosome membrane. therefore, lc <dig> staining shows a change from diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to intense punctate labelling when autophagosome formation is induced. lc <dig> staining remained diffuse within the cytoplasm in sham-operated rats or contra-lateral hemisphere . in contrast, lc <dig> staining displayed numerous punctate dots within the cytoplasm after transient mcao . lc3-immunopositive cells reached the peak in the peri-infarct region at  <dig> days after mcao and decreased thereafter . there were significant differences in the number of lc3-punctate cells between control and physical exercise groups at  <dig>  and  <dig> days , but not at  <dig> days  . compared with control group, physical exercise alleviated autophagy. furthermore, the number of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with both neurological function scores  and relative infarct volumes , suggesting that activity of autophagy is associated with ischemic cellular injury. therefore, physical exercise improves functional recovery may, at least partially, through inhibition of autophagy.

the tunel-positive cells were rare in the contra-lateral hemisphere and sham-operated group after mcao. in contrast, the tunel-positive cells were evident in peri-infarct region at  <dig> days and then decreased gradually from  <dig> to  <dig> days . there were significant differences in the number of tunel-positive cells between physical exercise group and control group at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days , suggesting that physical exercise reduces apoptotic cell death .

to further investigate the demise of lc3-positive cells, double-labeled immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies against lc <dig> and tunel. notably, double staining showed that  <dig> % of lc3-positive cells were also stained with tunel . lc3/tunel double-positive cells were significantly lower in physical exercise groups than in control group . moreover, the induction of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with the number of tunel-positive cells .

physical exercise increased the expression of igf- <dig> and promoted neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region
igf-1-positive cells were evident on ischemic side but were rarely detected on the contra-lateral hemisphere . there was no co-localization between igf- <dig> and lc3-ii. compared with control group, physical exercise increased the expression of igf- <dig> at all the observed time points  .

ki <dig>  a proliferative marker, was used to evaluate neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region. at  <dig> days after mcao, ki67-positive cells were obvious in the peri-infarct region, but were barely visible in the contra-lateral cerebrum and sham-operated group . the number of ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region reached the peak at  <dig> days and decreased thereafter. physical exercise significantly increased ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> days  after mcao .

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the effects of physical exercise on autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis. we found that ischemia-induced autophagy was associated with apoptotic cell death but not with neurogenesis, suggesting a deleterious role of autophagy in brain ischemic injury. in addition to attenuating autophagy and apoptotic cell death, physical exercise also promoted igf- <dig> expression and cell proliferation, thereby improving functional recovery.

the function of autophagy in exercise-mediated protection against ischemia still remains controversial. for example, in myocardial infarction, prior exercise maintains basal autophagy and protects against cardiac ischemic injury  <cit> . on the other hand, post-ischemic exercise reduces the ratio of lc3ii/lc3i and improves functional recovery  <cit> . it is generally believed that imbalance or excessive autophagy promotes cellular pathology and ultimately leads to cell death in cerebral ischemia  <cit> . however, the relationship between autophagy and exercise-mediated neuroprotection is not clear. consistently, we found that autophagosomes were accumulated after focal cerebral ischemia. in contrast, physical exercise attenuated ischemia-induced autophagosome accumulation . the suppression of autophagy by exercise was positively associated with the recovery of neurological function  and reduction of brain damage , suggesting that physical exercise may improve functional recovery from ischemic stroke, at least in part, through inhibition of autophagy. cell death, especially apoptosis, is a major contributor to neuronal damage in cerebral ischemia  <cit> . the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis is very complex. autophagy can either promote or inhibit apoptosis under different conditions  <cit> . interestingly, we found that tunel-positive and lc3-punctate cells were pronounced in the peri-infarct region and the number of tunel-positive cells was positively correlated with the number of lc3-punctate cells . physical exercise significantly reduced both autophagic and apoptotic cell death. given that autophagy and apoptosis can share many common death pathways  <cit> . our findings suggest that autophagy may play a pathologic role in ischemic cell death whereas physical exercise may attenuate ischemia-induced brain damage through inhibition of common upstream signals for cell death.

neurogenesis, particularly igf-1-mediated neurogenesis, is a major mechanism underlying beneficial effects of exercise on ischemic stroke  <cit> . post-ischemic neurogenesis is a complex process involving coordination of multiple signaling pathways. it has been reported that autophagy can play opposite roles in regulating neurogenesis depending on different conditions. for example, activation of autophagy can modulate cell proliferation during neuronal development and regeneration  <cit> . on the other hand, reducing autophagic activity has been shown to promote neurogenesis after ischemic stroke  <cit> . in addition, igf- <dig> is also thought to have significant inhibitory actions on autophagy through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex  <dig>   <cit> . consistently, exercise significantly increased the numbers of igf-1- positive cells and ki67-labeled proliferation cells. however, lc <dig> was not co-localized with either igf- <dig> or ki- <dig>  indicating that autophagy may not be directly involved in ischemia-induced neurogenesis. whether igf- <dig> plays a role in exercise-induced mitigation of atuophagy needs further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our results suggest that the benefit of physical exercise on functional recovery is associated with mitigation of autophagy, attenuation of apoptosis and enhancement of neurogenesis as evidenced by igf- <dig> expression and cell proliferation in the peri-infarct region after stroke.
