BACKGROUND
as sessile organisms, plants have adapted to their changing surroundings and their survival is based primarily on timely evolved immune responses. the first line of defense occurs at the plant cell surface with the recognition of conserved microbial groups such as lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans, commonly revered to as pathogen or microbe-associated molecular patterns . the mamps are recognized by cognate pattern-recognition receptors  and trigger immediate immune responses leading to basal pamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . known prrs fall into one of two receptor classes: transmembrane receptor kinases and transmembrane receptor-like proteins, the latter of which lack any apparent internal signaling domain  <cit> . notably, prrs are components of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane under tight control by protein phosphatases and other regulatory proteins  <cit> . in a number of cases specialized pathogens are able to overcome basal pti by either circumventing the detection of pamps or interfering with pti by delaying, suppressing or reprogramming host responses via delivery of effector molecules inside host cells. as a counter mechanism, deployed intracellular resistance  proteins detect the presence of these effectors directly or indirectly leading to effector-triggered immunity . the rpm1-interacting protein  <dig>  is a well-studied key-player in the former situation  <cit> , whereas direct interaction could be exemplified by the r genes and effectors in the rice – magnaporthe oryzae pathosystem  <cit> .

the plant resistance proteins are modular, that is, they consist of combinations of conserved elements some with features shared with animals reviewed by . the majority of r proteins are typically composed of a nucleotide-binding site  with a leucine-rich repeat  domain of variable length at the c-terminus. these nb-lrr proteins are divided into two classes on the basis of their n-terminal sequences consisting either of a coiled-coil  sequence or of a domain that shares sequence similarity with the drosophila melanogaster toll and human interleukin- <dig> receptor referred to as tir. these blocks of conserved sequences have remained throughout evolution and can still be identified in diverse organisms of eubacteria, archaea, metazoans and bryophytes  <cit> . despite this high degree of conservation, the r proteins confer resistance to a broad spectrum of plant pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes and nematodes .

nb-encoding resistance genes have been annotated in many monocot and dicot species pioneered by arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the current wealth of genomes of sequenced plant species has revealed r genes to be one of the largest plant gene families. in the reference genome of a. thaliana,  <dig> r-proteins harbor a lrr motif whereof  <dig> are composed of tir-nb-lrr and  <dig> have cc-nb-lrr domains  <cit> . several shorter proteins also are present comprising one or two domains represented by  <dig> tir-nb encoding genes and  <dig> genes with tir-x domains. in total, a. thaliana has approximately ~ <dig> proteins with one to three r gene-associated protein domain combinations.

in this study we took advantage of the accelerating genome information in a. thaliana and performed genome-wide analyses of r genes in  <dig> a. thaliana genomes. we further expanded the analysis by including the genomes of the related arabidopsis lyrata, capsella rubella, brassica rapa and eutrema salsugineum species. in addition we selected two loci harboring resistance to brassica fungal pathogens in order to trace down their evolutionary patterns. we found that  <dig> r genes formed a core set within a. thaliana, whereas as few as five r genes were retrieved from the genomes of the five different species. one of those five genes, the hopz-activated resistance  <dig>  gene known to possess novel signaling requirements is also present in other plant families within the rosid clade. the resistance to leptosphaeria maculans  <dig>  locus was partly conserved in a. lyrata and c. rubella and greatly diversified in b. rapa and e. salsugineum, while the rlm <dig> locus has recently evolved in the arabidopsis genus. this work provides aspects on r gene diversity and choice of reference genotype in comparative genomic analysis.

RESULTS
a core set of  <dig> r genes is present in  <dig> a. thaliana genomes
to gain insight on the level of r gene conservation in a. thaliana, we analyzed the reference genome of col- <dig> and  <dig> additional accessions   <cit> . these  <dig> genomes were chosen primarily for their sequence quality, high coverage, rna sequencing data and de novo assembly. pfam homology and coils server searches on the predicted  <dig> nb-lrr-encoding genes  <cit>  resulted in a reduced list of  <dig> r genes in col- <dig> for further analysis, comprising  <dig> cc-nb-lrr  and  <dig> tir-nb-lrrs  . between  <dig>  to  <dig>  of these r genes were found within the genomes of the  <dig> newly sequenced a. thaliana accessions . no additional r genes besides those present in col- <dig> were found in the trace sequence archives of the  <dig> genomes.figure  <dig>

in a comparison of the  <dig> cnl encoding genes in col- <dig>  between  <dig>  to  <dig>  were recovered in the selected accessions . the protein products of the remaining genes orthologous to the cnl proteins in col- <dig> were either missing one or several domains  or were completely absent in at least one accession . representatives of known defense-related genes that were absent included rps <dig> in edi- <dig>  no- <dig> and sf- <dig>  and adr <dig> in zu- <dig>  for gene abbreviations, see additional file 2: table s <dig>  in the tnl group, the number of complete tnl genes varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . examples of missing genes were rpp <dig> in ct- <dig>  mt- <dig>  oy- <dig> and wu- <dig>  and snc <dig> in can- <dig>  edi- <dig>  no- <dig>  rsch- <dig>  tsu- <dig> and wu- <dig> 

in summary, a rather wide distribution of r gene repertoires was found among the  <dig> a. thaliana accessions. out of the  <dig> encoding r genes in col- <dig>   <dig> genes had orthologs in the other  <dig> accessions. however,  <dig> of these genes lacked one or two domains in at least one accession. for example, rpp <dig> had lost its lrr domain in no- <dig>  rsch- <dig>  wil- <dig> and zu- <dig>  in the remaining core set of  <dig> cnl and  <dig> tnl encoding genes, all randomly distributed over the genome , nine genes , are known to be implicated in various plant defense responses.

five nb-lrr genes are conserved in five members of the brassicaceae family
to expand the analysis on r genes in a. thaliana, we monitored possible conservation of r genes across lineages in brassicaceae represented by a. lyrata, c. rubella, b. rapa and e. salsugineum. pfam homology and coils server searches identified  <dig> proteins with cnl or tnl architecture . the number of predicted cnl and tnl encoding genes varied greatly: e. salsugineum , c. rubella , a. thaliana col- <dig> , a. lyrata , and b. rapa , numbers that do not reflect the genome sizes or number of predicted gene models in the individual species.

orthologous sequences in the five species were identified by phylogenetic analysis of the nb domains in the cnl and tnl sequences. in the resulting phylogenetic tree,  <dig> clades with orthologs from at least two plant species were formed . within these  <dig> clades, multi-copy genes from single species were also found identified as in-paralogous sequences within that specific species. the placement of the sequences outside the  <dig> clades was not resolved. within the orthologous sequences a bias towards the tnl group was seen, with  <dig> out of  <dig> a. thaliana tnl sequences having an ortholog in one or more species, while only  <dig> out of  <dig> cnls had an ortholog. excluding in-paralogous genes, the highest number of orthologous sequences was identified between a. thaliana and a. lyrata , as concurrent with earlier findings  <cit> . from the a. thaliana core set of  <dig> genes,  <dig> cnl and  <dig> tnl genes were also found within two or more species including adr1-l <dig>  adr1-l <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  ttr <dig> and zar <dig> figure  <dig>

in total, two cnl clades and three tnl clades with sequences from all five species were identified. only one of these clades  contained a gene implicated in defense responses, known as zar <dig> and required for recognition of the pseudomonas syringae t3se hopz1a effector  <cit> . zar <dig> has homologs in several species within the rosid clade as well as in vitis vinifera and solanum species, and in our dataset zar <dig> was well conserved, with a ka/ks ratio of  <dig>  supporting purifying selection. two other genes, at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> were found in the same clade , suggesting that they were paralogous to each other and possibly have redundant functions. in this clade, b. rapa and e. salsugineum were represented with three and two genes, respectively, while there was a single gene from a. lyrata and c. rubella. phylogenetic analysis of the cds sequences revealed that only the at5g <dig> gene was conserved among the five species . the rps <dig> gene was earlier found in several brassica species, including b. montana, b. rapa and b. oleracea  <cit> , and it has most likely a homolog  in a. lyrata  <cit> . in our dataset, the a. thaliana rps <dig> gene was also identified in e. salsugineum but not in c. rubella. however, a blastn homology search, revealed similarity between rps <dig> and a region annotated on the anti-sense strand as a gene without any domains in c. rubella . the high similarity and identity of  <dig>  suggested a possible third cnl gene being conserved among the five species.

in summary, orthology with two cnl genes  with the possible addition of rps <dig> and three tnl genes  was observed in all five species. within the  <dig> genomes of a. thaliana only the cnl genes were conserved in this particular genomic comparison. no known function has been attributed to four out of the five conserved genes, including their orthologs.

conservation and diversification of the rlm <dig> locus
l. maculans is a hemitrophic fungal pathogen and the causal agent of the widespread blackleg disease of brassica crops  <cit> . the rlm <dig> locus in a. thaliana col- <dig> was earlier identified as displaying important roles in the immune response  <cit>  and contains seven genes with tnl architectures spanning between at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> . two genes, rlm1a and rlm1b were found to be responsible for rlm <dig> activity, with rlm1a as the main player in the immune response  <cit> . no function is known for the remaining five rlm1c-rlm1g genes. diversification in resistant loci in different accessions has been demonstrated in several cases  <cit>  and to expand our knowledge on rlm <dig>  we studied the presence and diversification of rlm <dig> in our genomic data set.

here, we found rlm1a to be present in all  <dig> a. thaliana accessions encoding all three domains in fourteen accessions . this is in agreement with their resistance phenotype  <cit> . in general the rlm1a genes in  <dig> accessions had very few variable sites compared to rlm1a in col- <dig> . ws- <dig> was atypical and diverged most with  <dig> variable sites in comparison to rlm1a in col- <dig> resulting in a p-distance of  <dig> % . no rlm1a homologs were identified in the a. lyrata, b. rapa and e. salsugineum genomes. one rlm1a candidate was found un-annotated in the c. rubella genomic sequence and rna expression data of the lrr region  <cit>  suggests that this gene is expressed, and might have a potential role in defense responses. to support our findings, pcr amplification and sequencing of the rlm1a region in a. lyrata, b. rapa and c. rubella confirmed that only c. rubella has maintained rlm1a. b. rapa species are not known to host resistance to l. maculans  <cit>  except the weedy relative b. rapa ssp. sylvestris  <cit> . in order to clarify the presence of rlm1a we used rlm1a specific primers to amplify this region in b. napus cv. surpass  <dig> harboring resistance traits from the wild b. rapa relative, the gene progenitor, and for comparison, a known susceptible b. rapa genotype. here, only b. rapa ssp. sylvestris contained a genomic sequence highly similar to the rlm1a gene of a. thaliana .figure  <dig>

the rlm1b gene has a minor role in the immune response and is flanked by rlm1c and rlm1d. these three tnl genes encoded proteins lacking one or more domains in most of the  <dig> accessions in comparison to col- <dig>  especially rlm1d . one possible candidate orthologous to rlm1c was found in the genomic sequence of c. rubella but using the annotation of a. thaliana for comparison the potential gene had multiple stop codons. similarity was found for the rlm1b to rlm1c genes in the genome of a. lyrata, b. rapa and e. salsugineum . due to the lack of orthology between species this chromosomal region seems to be under positive selection, showing a reduction of the rlm1b to rlmd genes within a. lyrata and e. salsugineum. in b. rapa on the contrary an expansion was observed with five tnl and one tn genes annotated to the rlm1b-rlm1d region, showing similarity to the rlm1b and rlm1c genes of a. thaliana col- <dig> 

the most conserved sequence within the a. thaliana accessions were rlm1e, f and g genes which displayed only a few modifications  . further conservation was observed for rlm1f and rlm1g in a. lyrata, the latter containing two orthologs to the rlm1f and rlm1g genes with ka/ks ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in comparison to a. thaliana col- <dig>  additionally, similarity was found for rlm1g to the genomic region in c. rubella  and transcript data has previously revealed that rlm1g is expressed in c. rubella  <cit> . in b. rapa, five tnl encoding genes were found to be orthologous to rlm1f and rlm1g , but only two were found in the rlm <dig> locus. the three other tnl encoding genes were located elsewhere with no synteny with the rlm <dig> locus. no orthology was found for the rlm1e to rlm1g genes in e. salsugineum.

overall, in the a. thaliana accessions the rlm <dig> locus is conserved in the rlm1e to rlm1g region and appears to have experienced diversification in the rlm1a to rlm1d sequence stretch. an exception was wu- <dig>  in which the rlm <dig> locus was highly similar to the rlm <dig> locus in col- <dig>  with only an average p-distance of  <dig> % . in the other four species, several of the rlm <dig> genes have experienced diversification in comparison to a. thaliana as well as to each other. the exception is the conserved rlm1g in both a. lyrata and c. rubella and the rlm1f in a. lyrata while rlm1a was also found in c. rubella.

the rlm <dig> locus is unique for a. thaliana and a. lyrata
the rlm <dig> gene is of importance for immune responses not only to l. maculans but also to botrytis cinerea and alternaria species  <cit> . the gene encodes tir and nb domains, but lacks a lrr domain. instead, the c-terminal end contains three copies of the dzc  or brx domain  originally described having a role in root development  <cit> . in addition to rlm <dig>   <dig> genes in a. thaliana col- <dig> contain tn genes without lrr domains  <cit> . however, rlm <dig> is the only tn gene in the a. thaliana reference genome that contains brx domains. to gain more insight on the tn encoding genes in a. thaliana col- <dig>  a pfam homology and coils server search was employed. this was designed to exclude genes with truncated tir or nb domain, resulting in eleven tn genes . the presence of the tn encoding genes was further investigated in the  <dig> additional a. thaliana genomes.

overall, we found between six  and eleven  genes encoding both the entire tir and nb domain . of the eleven tn genes in col- <dig>  seven were present in all  <dig> accessions, with three encoding the complete tn. the remaining four genes encoded modifications  in at least one accession . at1g <dig> was absent in most accessions  and encoding only a tir domain in bur- <dig>  ct- <dig> and sf- <dig>  when we expanded the pfam homology searches we found seven tns in a. lyrata, one in c. rubella, sixteen in b. rapa and no tn encoding gene in e. salsugineum. within the phylogenetic tree, five clades with orthologous proteins were identified . none of the clades contained proteins from all four species.

a complete rlm <dig> sequence was present in  <dig> out of  <dig> a. thaliana accessions including col- <dig> and no transcripts lacking one or more domains were identified. the high ka/ks ratio of  <dig>  suggests that rlm <dig> is under positive selection in the  <dig> accessions. examination of the chromosome region spanning the rlm <dig> locus revealed that approximately  <dig>  bp in col- <dig> was completely absent in six accessions , while the flanking genes; at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> were present . the at4g <dig> gene has experienced mutations and small deletions, resulting in early stop codons. the approximately 400 bp between at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> not found in the col- <dig> genomic sequence showed minor polymorphisms between these six accessions indicating that the deletion of rlm <dig> resulted from a single event.

a rlm3-like gene was found in a. lyrata  suggesting the presence of rlm <dig> before the split from a. thaliana ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . in contrast, no rlm <dig> homolog was found in the c. rubella, b. rapa and e. salsugineum genome sequences. to further trace a possible origin of rlm <dig>  the brx domain was used in phylogenetic analysis but no orthology could be found to sequences within the kingdom plantae . we conclude that rlm <dig> has most likely evolved entirely within the genus of arabidopsis.

discussion
in this report we describe a genome-wide survey of the large r gene family in  <dig> a. thaliana accessions and four related species in the brassicaceae family. the comparisons of the a. thaliana accessions revealed a great variation in gene numbers and a biased loss of lrr domains. interestingly, the col- <dig> genome was the most r gene dense accession in the dataset. we checked for biases in the re-sequencing and gene annotation process of the additional a. thaliana genotypes but could not identify any obvious explanation for loss of r genes in these accessions. this is in line with a recent genome study comprising de novo assembly of  <dig> a. thaliana accessions, which revealed large variation in genome size, with  <dig> - <dig>  mb of new sequences and 200– <dig> additional genes per genotype  <cit> . the differences were however found to be mainly due to 45s rdna copies and no new r genes absent in col- <dig> was reported.

col- <dig> is a direct descendent of col- <dig> and was selected from a landsberg population based on its fertility, and vigorous plant growth  <cit> . the same population was used in irradiation experiments, resulting in the landsberg erecta accessions . it has now become clear that the original landsberg population contained a mixture of slightly different genotypes, explaining the observed difference in r gene repertoire between col- <dig> and ler- <dig>  the genetic variation among a. thaliana accessions as observed in our dataset has a long history of being exploited for r gene mapping and cloning. characterization of resistance genes to p. syringae  together with rpp genes to the oomoycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis have been in the forefront and also advanced the understanding of interactions with pathogen effectors. the rpp <dig> locus of the ws- <dig> and nd- <dig> accessions recognize different h. arabidopsidis isolates, an observation that lead to the discovery of the avirulence gene atr <dig> and six divergent alleles  <cit> . sequence alignment with atr <dig> syntenic genes in phytophthora sojae and p. infestans in turn revealed the rxlr translocation core motif, adding another dimension to the genetic makeup of host-pathogen pairs and effector biology.

within the  <dig> accessions of a. thaliana a large number of r genes were missing one or more domains in comparison to col- <dig>  with the loss of lrr domains as the most common alteration. modulation of the lrr sequences together with gene conversion, domain swapping and deletion events are suggested strategies for a plant to co-evolve with a pathogen. lrr domains have been identified in a diverse variety of bacterial, protist and fungal species, together representing thousands of genes  <cit> . fusion of the lrr domains with the nb domain is of a more recent origin than lrr fusion with receptor-like kinases, which are seen only in the land plant lineage. the lrr domain is suggested to have evolved several times resulting in eight specific classes, which differ in sequence length and similarity within the variable segment of the lrr domain  <cit> . one of the lrr classes, referred to as plant specific lrrs has been shown to be under diversifying selection in several r proteins . this type of sequence diversifications most likely reflects co-evolution with pathogen effectors, proteins known to directly or indirectly interact with the lrr motifs . the importance of presence or absence of a particular lrr domain has also been demonstrated. in the absence of the p. syringae effector avrpphb, the lrr domain of rps <dig> inhibits the activity of the cc and nb domains  <cit> . consequently, loss of the lrr suppressor activity results in plant cell death due to constitutive rps <dig> activity. it was therefore not surprising that none of the rps <dig> homologs in our dataset lacked the lrr domain. rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> sequences were highly conserved between accessions and the lrr domains showed low degree of polymorphisms . in case of rps <dig> the lrr domain is important for protein stability but it lacks the suppressor activity, like rps <dig>  <cit> .

in many a. thaliana accessions in our dataset we found r genes encoding bipartite proteins, often represented by the loss of the lrr domain in comparison to col- <dig>  such tn-encoding genes have been speculated to function as adapter proteins interacting with tnl proteins or with downstream signaling components  <cit> . for example, pbs <dig>  an important player in the rps <dig> defense response, was found to interact with a tn protein  <cit> . whether cn and tn genes in general act in protein complexes recognizing pathogen effectors remains to be demonstrated. plant r genes encoding bipartite proteins also have been speculated to be part of an evolutionary reservoir in plants, allowing the formation of new genes through duplications, translocation and fusion  <cit> . the fusion between the tn and brx domain in rlm <dig> is unique for a. thaliana and a. lyrata, possible dimerizing with other brx domain-containing proteins, since homo- and heterodimerization capability between brx domains of individual proteins has been shown  <cit> . further, the transcription factor brx, containing two brx domains was shown to control the expression of a gene important in brassinolide synthesis  <cit>  and thereby modulate both plant root and shoot growth.

in our dataset we observed a great variation in the number of unique cnl and tnl r genes, ranging from  <dig> in e. salsugineum to  <dig> in b. rapa. copy number differences within different species of the r gene family is proposed to be driven by gene loss through pseudogenization or expansion through duplication events and subsequent divergence  <cit> . the five species in our dataset represent two lineages; lineage i  and lineage ii , diverging at approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . due to the close relationship between the five species, higher numbers of conserved r genes was expected, but no lineage-specific r gene repertoires were found. comparative genomic analysis between a. thaliana and b. rapa already established orthology between several nb-lrr genes  <cit> . however, in our study we found eleven additional sets including orthologs to adr1-l <dig>  adr1-l <dig>  rpp <dig>  rpp <dig> and zar <dig>  out of the  <dig> r genes analyzed, only two cnls and three tnls were conserved in the five species. one of these, zar <dig>  is also present in many other species within the eudicots, mainly within the rosid clade  <cit> . the rosid clade diverged from the caryophyllales and asterids more than  <dig> mya  <cit>  suggesting an ancient origin of the zar <dig> gene. recently it was shown that zar <dig> interacts with the pseudokinase zed <dig> in mediating immunity to p. syringae  <cit> . this pseudokinase family is also common among flowering plants and it could be speculated that pseudokinases and zar <dig> plays a general role in basal plant defense responses not seen in the eti response triggered by p. syringae in a. thaliana.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we have revealed a large variation in the r gene repertoire in the a. thaliana accessions, highlighting both the fast evolving nature of the r gene family but also a potential bias in the usage of a single genotype for genome comparisons. the recent advances in genome sequencing technologies enable re-sequencing of genotypes of interest for crop improvements with reasonable costs and rapid generation of molecular markers that co-segregate with traits of interest. an abundant supply of gene information from the rich genetic resources of brassica species can therefore be foreseen along with methods for enrichment of genes of interests. using such strategies, the number of nb-lrr genes in the potato genome was increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , demonstrating new avenues and breakthroughs made possible by next generation sequencing in the relatively short time that has passed since the sequencing of the first flowering plant.
