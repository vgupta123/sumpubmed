BACKGROUND
n-terminal acetylation  is one of the major protein modifications of the eukaryotic cytosol and occurs mainly co-translationally  <cit> . in plants, most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytosol and targeted to the chloroplast by a transit peptide that is cleaved upon arrival inside the organelle. large scale analyses show that 20–40% of these proteins are n-acetylated in their mature chloroplastic form  <cit> . the determination of the associated cleavage site of the transit peptide  are still challenging. the cleavage positions of the mitochondrial or plastid tp  can be predicted using targetp or chlorop softwares  <cit> , but the predictions are not always reliable  <cit> . although experimental data provide useful information, it still remains difficult to identify the true n-terminal peptides amid the multitude of internal peptides identified in a large scale experiment. in addition, the determination of nta yield is a difficult task with the tools currently available. as an exemple, mascot distiller  allows nta quantitation using peptides n-terminally labeled with d3-  or d0-  acetyl  <cit> . although this tool was used to define lys ε-acetylation yield  <cit> , it is originally dedicated to provide protein differential quantitation. the determination of the nta yield for each proteoform  is not easily available and requires some additional processing  <cit> .

therefore, the development of a new tool designed to perform the extraction of the data computed by mascot and mascot-distiller is required. the combination of the outputs must provide a list of the mature n-termini and the associated accurate nta yields. although some alternative tools could be able to perform h/l ratio quantitation such as maxquant, the encounter script is not able, presently, to handle other input file format than the mascot and mascot-distiller ones.

the encounter tool  uses a stepwise approach. first, the characterized peptides are scored to discriminate between protein n-termini at position 1– <dig> and downstream n-termini  of the protein sequence. this determination is based on a curated experimental dataset. second, encounter recalculates the average nta yield taking into account the first residue of the characterised mature proteins. finally, it provides an exhaustive list of the processed n-termini with the recalculated unbiased nta yield. the encounter tools was trained using a manually validated dataset . as a proof of concept, the optimized parameters were used against a complex arabidopsis thaliana experimental dataset obtained after an enrichment of the mature protein n-termini using the silpronaq approach  <cit> . such experimental data set provides  <dig> dnt peptides  of which  <dig> were quantified for nta yield. some of these n-termini , were experimentally validated and their positions well correlated with known cleavage sites of signal peptides, mtps or ctps . some others  were in accordance with transit peptide cleavage site predictions within a range of ±  <dig> residues. in addition,  <dig> protein n-termini were characterized at positions  <dig> or  <dig>  of which  <dig> were also quantified for protein nta yield .

methods
sample preparation and raw data aquisition
proteins extracted from a. thaliana col.  <dig> seedling were used to perform n-terminus enrichment using scx chromatography. rapidly, 1 mg of protein was denatured and reduced followed by cysteine alkylation with iodoacetamide. after cold acetone precipitation, proteins were resuspended in 50 mm nh4hco <dig> and digested by 1/ <dig>  of tpck treated porcine trypsin  for  <dig>  h at 37 °c, twice. peptides were desalted with sep-pak columns and the retained material was eluted with 80% acetonitrile ,  <dig> % tfa and then evaporated to dryness. the collected material was resuspended in strong cation exchange  lc buffer  and injected into an alliance hplc system using a fluorimeter detector  equipped with polysulfoethyl a column . peptides were eluted with a kcl gradient . fractions were collected every 2 min for 40 min and the solvent was evaporated to dryness before storage at −20 °c. fractions eluted from scx columns with retention times of  <dig> to 22 min were analyzed as previously described  <dig> with an easy nano-lc ii  coupled to a ltq-orbitrap™ velos . finally, data processing usually combines a few acquisition files, i.e.  <dig> files related to each individual scx fraction  and  <dig> files related to combined fractions . furthermore, acquisition files obtained from scx fraction  <dig> and  <dig> were used as training dataset and testing dataset, respectively.

mascot distiller/mascot data processing and *.xml exports
regardless of the number of orbitrap-ms acquired files, mascot distiller  combines all acquired files together for a unique processing event . the encounter script was first used to extract data from the raw files followed by protein identification using the mascot protein identification tool . precursor detection was obtained after peak re-gridding of  <dig> points per da for a peak half width of  <dig>  da. precursor ion charge was determined directly from the orbitrap survey scan and limited at  <dig> to  <dig>  the “time domain aggregated ms/ms spectra” was re-gridded at  <dig> points per da for a peak half width of  <dig>  da and ms/ms spectra containing more than  <dig> peaks were retained. ms/ms spectra of similar precursor masses were not combined at any time and considered separately for peptide identification. additional filtering parameters such as correlation threshold and minimal signal over noise ratio were defined at  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for the ms and ms/ms in the relevant mass range  with a maximum peak iteration of  <dig>  alternative high resolution mass spectrometers could be used but the md parameters applied for raw data extraction should be optimized accordingly.fig.  <dig> overview of the encounter processing scheme: from sample to mature n-terminus position and nta yield




md extracted data were submitted to mascot  <dig>  software for protein identification and post-translational modification characterization. the database used was “the arabidopsis information resource” . the parent and fragment mass tolerance were 5 ppm and  <dig>  da, respectively. additionally, carbamidomethylcysteine and d3-acetyl on lys were defined as fix modifications and methionine oxidation as variable modification. semi-trypsin was defined for the enzyme cleavage rule with up to  <dig> missed cleavages. peptide n-terminus acetylation status, i.e. d3-acetyl  or d0-acetyl  were investigated using the mascot quantification option . these parameters  are available in additional file  <dig>  then, md uploaded the mascot processing results and parsed them using relaxed parameters . irrelevant and false positive peptide hits generated at this step were filtered out at the final stage of the encounter process.

encounter also required protein identification data generated by mascot. these data were automatically exported in xml files with the same md parameters for the p-value and the mascot score threshold. additionally, the “mudpit scoring” and “bold red peptides” option were selected. these exported files contain all “protein hit information” except pi and taxonomy id and all “peptide match information” except the frame number and the unassigned queries.

encounter processing
basically, the encounter tool requires the md exported file, the associated mascot results and a parameter file. although the tool could be used with the default parameters provided , an optimization of the scoring parameters using a relevant training dataset has been performed. during the scoring parameter optimization, the encounter tool required an additional files containing the list of “curated n-termini” . at the end of the optimization, a file containing all optimized values was generated . this file could be applied on other experimental datasets  without the optimization of the scoring scheme.

parsing function
the encounter tool parses the pre-processed data exported from md and mascot identification tool. mascot matched queries  and associated protein ac were extracted from the md xml file. each of these entries were enriched with information, e.g. peptide sequence, starting position, md processing results such as h/l ratio and signal quality coefficients. then, the collected results were complemented with data extracted from the mascot exported files such as the peptide identification score, identification e value… of note, some peptides were not proteotypic  <cit>  and shared with few distinct proteins or, alternatively, to different translational isoforms of the same protein . the redundancy is noted and these data could be easily removed at will. also, the shared peptides were distinctively labelled in the final result list.

n-terminus scoring function
the encounter tool should discriminate internal peptides from the mature protein n-termini. biological details associated to nuclear encoded mitochondrial/plastidic proteins tp such as sequence composition and average length  , highlighted some features useful to define relevant scoring coefficients . to this end, we defined a scoring function based on six distinct coefficients related to i) peptide “starting position”, ii) residues around the “starting position”, iii) characterized n-terminal modifications, iv) alternative start positions at the vicinity of the “starting position”, v) matched peptide redundancies and finally iv) the “localization” score. some of these features could be optimized from the training dataset  whereas some other should be defined by the users to valorize/penalize experimental observations 
based on the experimental training dataset, encounter determines the optimal range  where “true” n-termini are the most frequently distributed. the matthews correlation coefficient  was determined for all possible combinations of positions between the two endpoints of the n-terminal distribution range of the “true” hits for the dnt candidates . the optimum range defined with the higher mcc provides the optimum endpoints . this positional range is associated with a scoring weight of  <dig> to favor the characterization of these n-termini. this calculation was associated to a “k fold cross validation”  to determine the robustness of the prediction and the results of the investigation were exported in the *.bound file  and *.json .

nevertheless, some relevant candidates  were still present outside of these optimal values, i.e. in between expmin/optimin and optimax/expmax. since the experimental dataset may be slightly different compared to the training dataset , the expmin and expmax values were pondered by the standard deviation observed during the “k fold cross correlation” as an estimation of the dataset variability . both ranges, i.e. min/optimin and optimax/max, were associated with a scoring weight of  <dig>  that prevented their elimination at this stage. all others positions are associated with a scoring weight below  <dig>  to penalize such less biologically relevant positions. starting positions 1– <dig> were subjected to a special scoring detailed below.

residues around the starting position 
based on the training dataset, encounter is able to provide a scoring matrix associated to the amino acid presents around the experimentally characterized starting position. for each position located between pn to p-n, a binary classification was performed for each of the  <dig> possible amino acids. such investigation provides a distribution of true positive , true negative , false positive  and false negative . the mcc was calculated for each of the  <dig> residues for each of the defined position between pn to p-n. the result of the mcc provided an overview of the “abundance” for each residue at a specific position  based on the training dataset. in accordance with our scoring scheme , the mcc results were translated by  <dig> unit . this tmcc matrix  was used to determine the “spec” score for each experimental candidate  as a product of the tmccs values for each position between p-n to pn . the size of the screening window  was also optimized automatically to determine the optimum mcc value.  <dig> spescore=∏i=−nntmccxxx;pi 


determination of the “spec” score base on the tmcc determined for each possible residue  at the define position pi .

a “k fold cross validation”  was applied after the optimization step to determine the robustness of the prediction. the “k fold cross validation” result was exported in the *.spec  and *.json .

n-terminal modifications 
due to the md processing applied during the peptide identification step, peptide’s n-terminal modifications are restricted to d0/d3-nta. three different situations could occur . it could be interesting to segregate differentially such peptides especially for gap test  <cit>  where the main goal is to identify the n-terminal acetylated  proteins and to rate them differently with values higher than  <dig> to valorize the modification or below  <dig> to penalize it. characterization of the pair d0/d3-ac reinforces the legacy of such n-termini the ms/ms spectra related to d0-ac and d3-nta could be considered as two independent events) and a score higher than  <dig> could be applied.

alternative start positions 
despite proteins processing sites are usually considered to be unique, experimentally-based results tend to display a different reality involving multiple vicinal cleavage positions  <cit> . this provides clear and highly valuable distinctive criteria compared to internal protein fragments. the number of potential cleavage sites was determined in a defined window around the investigated position. both the window size and the coefficient-weight could be defined in the parameters file , and the “prox score” for this coefficient was obtained using eq.  <dig>  initial parameters should be defined in the configuration file and optimized using the reference dataset but usually these multiple and vicinal cleavages  <cit>  are observed in a windows of ± 5– <dig> residues .  <dig> prox.score.=rm 


with r = user defined weight and m = number of alternative cleavages sites experimentally characterized in the defined window ;

peptide redundancy 
multiple characterization of the same peptide strengthens the probability to match a real event. since each analysis provides thousands of acquired independent ms/ms spectra, the identification of the same peptide from different ms/ms acquisition could be considered as independent event and strongly increase the probability to match a “real event” or “true peptide”. to take advantage of this redundancy, the number of occurrences of the same peptide  was used in the “rep score”. nevertheless, the number of duplicates matches could reach few hundreds to few thousands of hits for the same peptide especially if multiple lc-ms acquisitions are processed together. to maintain the weight of this coefficient within the range compatible with the others scoring coefficients, the number of occurrences for identical peptides was logarithm pondered in eq.  <dig>   <dig> repscore=klogq 


where k is the score associated to such event  and q = number of experimental occurrences of the investigated starting position;

localization score 
it is experimentally infrequent  <cit>  to characterize mature protein n-termini both at the n-terminal side of the predicted protein  and further downstream in the same sample. thus, it could be interesting to take advantage of such information to penalize/favor dnt peptides. the weight applied to dnt hits should be defined at will in the configuration file.

protein n-terminal scoring at position 1–2
since a negative dataset could not be defined for the n-termini at position  <dig> and  <dig>  automated optimization of the score is not possible. the “spec” score for these peptides is set at the optimized “spec-score-threshold  to favor the final nta quantification of these peptides. to note, the other scoring coefficients  were applied for these positions. then, the final encounter score for these peptides  could not be compared with the dnt associated scores.

scoring parameters optimization and calculation
since few parameters such as sample preparation or species influencing the type and number of downstream n-termini , a test sample dataset should be used to optimize the parameters. alternatively, default parameters are provided for the a. thaliana samples.

the encounter tool is able to optimize few scoring coefficients  using a reference files. some other parameters are not optimized automatically and could be subject to modification in the parameter file. each of them  should be defined before the encounter optimization to determine automatically the encounter threshold. this threshold is optimized using an mcc approach at the end of the optimization step. since the encounter score is the product of the six previously defined coefficients , each of them could be neutralized using the unit value  in the parameter files except for the “spec” scoring coefficient which is the backbone of this approach. scoring calculation was applied for each mascot characterized peptide.  <dig> encounterscore=bound×spec×acetyl×prox×rep×loc 


this optimization finishes with a “k fold cross validation” to provide some insights about the prediction robustness and the results are saved in the *.score , *.json  and *.param  file.

nta quantification function
mascot distiller is an interesting tool to determine d0/d3-acetylation yield for each characterized peptide. although, final quantitative values are provided per protein and not per protein starting position, the quantitative data remain available in the md xml exported file. the encounter script re-organizes them to provide n-terminal acetylation yield for each distinct proteoform. since md processing was performed using relaxed parameters , encounter filters those data to retain only the most relevant ones for the nta quantitation based on ms signal quality coefficients defined by md. encounter tool uses the “correlation coefficient” , the “fraction coefficient” , the sigqual coefficient is associated to the h/l standard deviation , the e-value , the mascot score associated to the matched query  and finally the encounter score threshold . these coefficients could not be defined by default and are strongly related to the raw ms signal quality. they should be adapted accordingly to the instrument  used for sample separation and analysis. the characterised peptides passing those criteria were used to determine the final h/l ratio for each distinct protein positions based on a logarithmic means. jointly, the logarithmic deviation  of the nta yield was determined to provide the minimum/maximum nta range when more than one ratios were determined. finally, the average nta yield was obtained from the average h/l ratio using the eq.  <dig> and the confidence interval  was defined by the eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> respectively using the logarithmic divergence coefficient.  <dig> %nta=1/1+<h/lratio> 
  <dig> %ntamin=1/1+<h/lratio>×σ 
  <dig> %ntamax=1/1+<h/lratio>/σ 


encounter data export
the final results were exported in a *.csv file providing protein ac’s, the proteotypicity, the starting position, the n-terminal modifications characterised, the mature n-terminal sequence , the encounter score, the < h/l > ratio , the n-terminus acetylation yield . an additional file was also exported containing all collected and processed data .

training and testing dataset
an experimental dataset collected during a large scale a. thaliana n-terminome characterization was used for the optimizing and the testing steps. out of the  <dig> acquired files, data associated to fraction  <dig> and  <dig> were used as training and testing datasets, respectively. first, the acquired data were processed for protein/peptide identification as described in “distiller/mascot data processing” section. for the peptides associated to a unique gene-id but few different translation versions, the lowest tair extension number was retained in the final list. non-proteotypic peptides  were removed from the final list. each characterized peptide was manually checked to identify mature n-termini. information from specialized databases such as at_chloro  <cit> , ppdb  <cit> , suba  <cit> , topfind  <cit> , mascp-gator  <cit>  and various prediction tools such as targetp / chlorop / signalp  <cit> ) or mitofate  <cit>  were used to assess n-termini relevancy and protein sub-cellular localization for each candidate . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> checked peptides were dispatched in few different subcategories  in fraction  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.table  <dig> distribution of the manually checked peptides for the training and testing datasets 




encounter launch
the encounter script should be launched in a prompt windows associated with the required files . first, encounter determined the optimized scoring parameters using the training dataset  and the reference n-terminal list. a few files are exported at the end of the optimization including the optimized “scoring parameter”  and the detailed results of the optimization and “k fold cross validation” . second, the experimental datasets  were scored using the previously optimized parameters to discriminate and quantify the mature n-termini and associated nta yield. at the end of the process, the encounter script provided two distinct files, i.e. the intermediary and final encounter results. the intermediary file provided the detailed values used to determine the encounter score and the individual nta quantitation, whereas the final encounter file provided the aggregated results per distinct proteoforms .

RESULTS
training and testing datasets
two experimental samples were defined as training and testing dataset i.e. fraction  <dig> and fraction  <dig> respectively. the peptides characterized after the mascot identification step are filtered using few different mascot–associated values using the peptide e-value and the minimum mascot score defined in the configuration files. these thresholds should be adapted to reach 1% of false discovery rate  at the peptide level. applying these thresholds, false positive identifications for the expected n-terminal peptide  were infrequent . as an example, no false candidate was characterized in fraction  <dig> and only one probable false hit was listed in fraction  <dig> . for these starting positions, the associated localizations were mainly the cytosol , the membrane/vacuole , the peroxisome  or the mitochondria . only one plastidic protein  was characterized with a mature n-termini at position  <dig>  this infrequent but not unusual chloroplastic n-terminus  <cit>  was confirmed experimentally and reported in ppdb  <cit> . the characterized n-termini at position 1– <dig> corresponded well to the expected cytoplasmic localizations.

additionally,  <dig> peptides were characterized with downstream starting position . these hits were sorted between true n-termini , false n-termini  and ambiguous n-termini . only the true/false candidates were used during the encounter training step. the main subcellular localization is the chloroplast with 73% of the candidates  for the “true” dataset. other locations such as cytosol, membrane or mitochondria were also found . at the contrary, the “false” dataset exhibits random location and similar distributions were also observed in fraction  <dig> dataset . these two manually curated datasets  were used during the encounter training and testing steps, respectively.

n-terminus scoring optimization
residues around the starting position 
residues close to the n-terminal position are, sometimes, associated to artifact modifications and/or -expected endoproteolytic cleavages. as an example, hydroxylated residues  could be wrongly associated to d3-nta. the specificity of the endoproteinase used during sample preparation could also create a bias in the characterized peptides. then, arg residue at p’ <dig> could be due to trypsin endoproteolytic cleavage  and may not be relevant as true maturation site. along a streamline, the endoproteinases or the associated contaminants could generate numerous unexpected peptides. as an example, the presence of pseudotrypsin  <cit>  or chymotyrypsin could generate some alternative n-termini with a phe or leu at p− <dig>  <cit> . typically, it is well know that some positions ahead of the tp cleaving position could be specific such as ala at p− <dig> and val/ile at p− <dig> for the plastidic proteins  or the arg at p− <dig> and p− <dig> for mitochondrial proteins . interestingly, different residues appear to be predominant for other protein subclasses, for example leu at position p− <dig> or asp at p1– <dig> for proteins carrying a signal peptide . the tmcc profiles  clearly reflect the importance of these residues  used in the “spec” score.fig.  <dig> example of the tmcc profiles related to few interesting residues around the transit peptide cleavage position




the “spec” coefficient is determined using a weight matrix of based on the distribution of specific residues around the cleavage site using the mccs. mcc reflects the presence/lack of specific residues around the cleavage position. this determination can be performed for both the “true” and the “false” reference dataset  compared to a random distribution of transit peptide cleavage position . “spec” score is the main basis of encounter scoring scheme and could be used alone to determine the final encounter score. the spec-associated matrix was determined for both the “true” and the “false” subsets from fraction  <dig> dataset. based on the “true” hits, encounter allows a discrimination at  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig> % specificity with  <dig> % fdr whereas the optimization based on the “false” dataset reached only  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig> % specificity with  <dig> % fdr . only the optimization using the true hits is retained for the final scoring scheme.table  <dig> results of the automated optimisation of the bound and spec parameters using the k fold cross validation result  and the final scoring scheme using the same validation approach

 for the prediction based on the false dataset, the encounter score must be below the determined threshold for the true hits




finally, a k fold cross validation  was performed to determine the robustness of this approach. the accuracy reach  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % sensitivity with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % fdr . although additional features should be used to prevent the loss of “true” hits, the results obtained using only the “spec” score are extremely promising.

peptide “starting position” score 
for most proteins, the mature n-term position is located on the first two residues of the protein sequence . nevertheless, some proteins n-termini could be located further downstream . for example, the mtp cleavage position is expected between positions 20– <dig> whereas for the position for the ctp of a. thaliana nuclear encoded proteins is expected between positions 40– <dig>  <cit> . in our training datasets , the validated downstream starting positions were distributed from position  <dig> to  <dig>  for the validated candidates  vs.  <dig> to  <dig> for the irrelevant candidates .

interestingly, few distinct tp regions  could be highlighted and are associated with proteins carrying a signal peptide , mitochondrial tp  and plastidic tp . comparatively, the starting positions of the “false” candidates were evenly distributed. then, it is interesting to favor/penalize selected regions depending of the protein training set. this allows the encounter tool to define the optimum range where mature n-terminal positions are characterized from the training dataset. the optimum range for fraction  <dig> dataset is in between positions 14– <dig> with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig> % specificity with  <dig> %. fdr. the associated “k fold cross correlation”  highlights the robustness of this determination . this parameter cannot be used alone but always in combination with the spec score . when combining “spec” and “bound” score,  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % accuracy with  <dig> % fdr are reached on fraction  <dig> training dataset. such combination clearly improved the encounter discrimination power compared to the “spec” score alone.

influence of the other scoring coefficients
by default, reliable predictions are reached using the spec score and the bound score together . nevertheless, it could be possible to improve the prediction specificity or sensitivity using the additional coefficients acetyl, prox, rep and/or loc. depending on the coefficient applied, it was possible to improve the sensitivity or the specificity of the encounter tool . as an example, the combination of spec, bound and prox coefficients provides a final  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig> % sensitivity with  <dig> % fdr. the associated k fold cross validation  was performed and provided  <dig>  ±  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % sensitivity at  <dig>  ±  <dig> % fdr .

although, the overall accuracy could be improved using different scoring combinations this was usually detrimental to the sensitivity. depending on the goal , scoring coefficient combinations could be adapted to reach better result than those provided in table  <dig> i.e. better accuracy or better sensitivity… in hour hands, the combination of the scoring coefficients spec, bound and prox provides a good starting compromise  that could be optimized at will. these optimized parameters were applied to the fraction  <dig> training dataset and provided the discrimination of the n-termini at  <dig> % of sensitivity and  <dig> % of specificity .

protein n-terminal acetylation quantitation
as previously mentioned, md could provide protein nta quantitation regardless of the multiple protein proteoforms. this is the example for the protein at1g <dig>  of which four distinct n-terminal positions could be characterized . md gave a single nta yield of  <dig> %  whereas encounter provided four distinct nta yield, i.e.  <dig> % ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % respectively for each proteoforms. another frequent md processing error is the aggregation of h/l value associated to internal peptides. as an example, the md quantification of at2g <dig>  protein combines the nta yield associated to position  <dig> and  <dig> for a final nta yield of  <dig> %  whereas encounter quantify only the n-terminus at position  <dig> with  <dig> % nta . furthermore, the encounter score of the peptide starting at position  <dig> is below the encounter threshold and is not considered as a significant n-terminus. it is clear that encounter discriminates the different n-termini and provides the most accurate nta yield for each of them with an error range below 1% in average .

example of application
as an example of application, our whole experimental dataset  was processed using the optimized encounter parameters. the parameters used where based on the results obtained during the optimization phase , i.e. the combination of the spec, bound and prox coefficients.  <dig> potential n-termini were listed of which  <dig> have an encounter score higher than the threshold . after the removal of the non-proteotypic peptides,  <dig> probable mature n-termini were listed of which  <dig> were located at position 1– <dig> and  <dig> at positions downstream of the protein n-terminus . the nta yield was determined for 594 n-termini  of which  <dig> were located at position 1– <dig> and  <dig> were associated to dnt .

as previously observed  <cit> , 73% of the characterised n-termini at position 1– <dig> were found fully acetylated , 18% not acetylated  and 9% were partially acetylated . these n-termini peptides were mainly located  in the cytosol , the nucleus  and also in the mitochondria  and the plastid . protein located in these last two compartments are frequently associated to tp excision. nevertheless, most of the characterised mitochondrial proteins are outer membrane proteins and the characterisation of a starting position  <dig> and  <dig> is biologically relevant. similarly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> plastid proteins are coded by the plastid genome. these proteins, expressed directly in the plastid, do not undergo transit peptide excision and were expected in this subset. considering the other  <dig> nucleus-encoded proteins which were annotated in suba  as being translocated to the chloroplast, some of them are known to be chloroplastic such as at2g <dig>  or at4g <dig>   <cit>  and the absence of ctp could be explained by some previously described alternative import mechanisms  <cit> . other candidates are erroneously associated to plastidic localisation such as at5g <dig>   which is clearly a mitochondrial protein.fig.  <dig> 
a-b average nta yield determined by encounter for the n-termini at a positions 1/ <dig> of the characterized proteins and b downstream . c protein subcellular localization distribution  for the n-termini position 1– <dig> and downstream




in addition to these expected n-termini,  <dig> downstream n-termini could be characterized with an encounter score higher than the threshold of which  <dig> were quantified for nta. the pattern of the dnt-nta yield with 8% of the downstream n-termini fully acetylated , 25% partially ntaed and 67% not acetylated  was clearly different  from protein nta profile . the subcellular distribution  was also strongly modified and the main localisation for the downstream n-termini was for 73% associated to plastidic proteins. additionally, dnt also revealed mitochondrial n-termini  resulting from mtp excision and alternative maturation of peroxisomal proteins , membrane proteins  or vacuolar proteins . as previously observed for pos 1– <dig>  some of the suba subcellular localisation were erroneous, e.g. cytosolic localisation for at1g <dig> or at4g <dig> while they are localized in the chloroplastic stroma  <cit> . some of the dnts could also be a consequence of an alternative splicing or alternative start position , or errors on the gene starting position . most of the  <dig> downstream n-termini highlighted by the encounter tool were clearly due to protein maturation processes. this result confirms the added-value of encounter to highlight mature proteins n-termini in complex peptide mixtures.

CONCLUSIONS
throughout few thousands experimentally characterised n-termini, the encounter tool is able to parse the most relevant mature protein n-termini with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig> % specificity on the training dataset . furthermore, the encounter tool is able to provide reliable nta yield for each distinct proteoform at the expected protein n-terminus  but also downstream.

applied to a large experimental dataset, the encounter tool was able to characterize more than 1200 n-termini of which almost  <dig> were quantified for nta yield. those characterised dnt could be associated to different maturation processes including nuclear encoded proteins targeting to various organelles , cytosolic maturations involving transient targeting peptides  or erroneously assigned protein starts. this tool provides a unique way to determine the experimental position of the protein mature n-terminus and nta acetylation yield for few hundreds up to thousands of candidates. this tool is especially interesting to determine accurately and rapidly the influence of various stresses on protein n-terminal status and n-terminal modification yield.
