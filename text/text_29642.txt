BACKGROUND
aging is defined by an increase in the probability of death over time associated with characteristic changes in phenotype  <cit> . sleep alteration is a common phenomenon observed in humans and animals during aging and is often associated with impaired learning and memory  <cit> . the oxidative stress resulting from the loss of control of reactive oxygen species  and the production of nitric oxide , when produced in excess and not balanced by antioxidants, represent an attractive process responsible, at least partially, for the above impairments during aging or related disorders such as alzheimer disease   <cit> . our recent data obtained in aged rats  <cit>  and in senescence accelerated prone  <dig> mice   <cit> , a model of early onset of human diseases  <cit> , support such an hypothesis.

no is an intracellular multifunctional molecule involved in both physiological and neurodegenerative processes of the cns. the dynamic of the no release taking place in the thalamus and the cortex  <cit>  and/or locally in the basal forebrain of the rat  <cit>  has been pointed as determinant in the modulation/regulation of the sleep-wake states and the maintenance of the brain homeostasis. in using pharmacological approaches  or ko mice, it has been, indeed, established that modulations of nitric oxide synthases , affect the sleep architecture in rodents. from these studies, no derived from the neuronal nos isoform  is confirmed as a powerful sleep-facilitating agent whereas, no produced by the inducible nos  plays a major role in triggering and maintenance of rapid-eye movement sleep  during aging. thus, nnos and inos have complementary roles in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle  <cit> .

however, no can also be neurotoxic and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases according to its free radical properties  <cit> . previous studies have shown that noss expression is altered in ad. for example, in humans, neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, that are vulnerable to neurodegeneration, express low levels of nnos while inos plays a role in the formation of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles  <cit> . a similar pattern of no dysfunction is observed in the senescence-accelerated mouse , a model of accelerated aging. in this way, various findings have suggested that accumulation of the damages exerted by no-derived from inos together with the alterations resulting from glutamate signaling and cholinergic deficits lead to the degeneration of neurons and glia in brain. these impairments are also accompanied by learning and memory deficits occurring before the median age of survival of samp <dig> mouse  <cit> . by contrast to inos, it is still unclear whether nnos is causally linked with the hippocampal dysfunction, the behavioral deficits and the neuronal death. the results obtained vary from an increase to a significant reduction in the nnos activity and the protein content in the cerebral structures of the aged rat or sam mouse  <cit> .

in the present study, we evaluated the age-related variations occurring in nnos expression and activity, nitrites/nitrates levels  in the frontal cortex, the hippocampus and the brainstem of samp <dig> or senescence accelerated-resistant  mice. together with previous data  <cit> , results obtained point out that samp <dig> unlike samr <dig> are exposed at an early stage to alterations of the no derived from nnos and inos. such alterations might be causally linked to the senescence-related impairments and the degeneration observed in the brain of samp <dig> 

RESULTS
age-dependent mrna expression
data from rt-pcr are shown in fig. 1a. from  <dig> to  <dig> months of age, a significant decrease  in nnos mrna level was seen in the three brain areas of samp <dig> but only in the cortex and the hippocampus of samr <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig> months, nnos mrna level was reduced  in the brainstem of samp <dig> while a significant increase  takes place in the cortex and hippocampus of samp <dig> and samr <dig>  when comparisons were made between 2-vs 12-months of age, results indicate that nnos mrna level was reduced  in the hippocampus but increased  in the cortex of samp <dig> and samr <dig>  in  <dig> month-old animals, nnos mrna level was significantly lower  in the hippocampus but significantly higher  in the cortex than in  <dig> month-old ones. by contrast, nnos mrna level was lower  in the brainstem at 12-vs  <dig> months of age, only in samp <dig> 

age-dependent nnos activity and no-x production
the profiles of age-related changes occurring in nnos activity are given in fig. 1b. in samp <dig>  nnos activity increased  in the cortex and the brainstem from  <dig> to  <dig> months, and then decreased  in 12-vs  <dig> or  <dig> month-old mice. by contrast, nnos activity markedly decreased  in the hippocampus at 8-vs  <dig> months of age and remained low with age. in samr <dig>  nnos activity did not change significantly in the cortex and the brainstem from  <dig> to  <dig> months but afterward, it decreased  with age. so, nnos was lower  in12-vs  <dig> or  <dig> month-old samr <dig> 

the variations occurring in nox- levels are shown in fig. 1c. nox- levels were higher  in the cortex and the brainstem of 8-vs  <dig> month-old samp <dig> and samr <dig>  the maximal increase  occurred in the cortex of samp <dig> and was followed by a decrease with age. so, nox- levels were lower in the cortex  and the brainstem  of 12-vs  <dig> month-old samp <dig> and samr <dig>  finally, nox- levels were higher  in the cortex of  <dig> month-old samp <dig> than in age-matched samr <dig>  in the hippocampus, nox- were undetectable  in both samp <dig> and samr <dig> 

discussion
in the central nervous system no is produced by noss. three different isozymes have been identified and nnos accounts for the majority of the physiological actions of no  <cit> . it is well documented that nnos and inos have complementary roles in sleep regulation, learning and memory  <cit>  and neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . previously, we demonstrated that the loss of inos activation is responsible to sleep impairments  at an early age in samp <dig>  <cit> . to extend our previous hypothesis on the putative role of no in the accelerated brain aging of samp <dig>  in this study, we examined the age-related changes occurring in the nnos expression and activity and no-x levels within the brainstem sleep-structure, the cortex and the hippocampus of samp <dig> and compared them to age-matched samr <dig>  the main findings obtained indicate the existence of biphasic changes in no metabolism: 1- a down-regulation of nnos mrna at  <dig> months of age followed by a slight up-regulation with age except within the brainstem; 2- an increase in nnos activity and nox- levels, followed by a decrease with age, in the cortex and the brainstem in samp <dig> and samr <dig>  by contrast, our data show a marked decrease in nnos activity in the hippocampus at  <dig> months of age, i.e. well before aging, only in samp <dig>  these results agree with previous data and suggest that the down-regulation of nnos activity at an early age is causally linked with accelerated brain aging in samp <dig>  the fact that nnos activity remains constant with age reinforces such an evidence  <cit> . however, our present data also indicate that: -nnos mrna levels are not well correlated with activity values; no-x levels are undetectable in whole hippocampi. this latter point, suggests that a more appropriate dissection is necessary to consider the part played by no in the dorsal hippocampus and mainly in which regards the spatial information processing. other studies conducted in human and rodents agree with our present findings. in this sense, it has been reported that: 1- different regions behave differently during aging and/or degeneration  <cit> ; 2- nnos expression and synthesis can be regulated by ca2+fluxes independently from nnos activity especially in the hippocampus  <cit> ;  there is a post-transcriptional regulation of nnos expression in the brain of sam  <cit> .

in the same way, the neurotoxicity of no has been now extensively investigated and it appears that the no production confers resistance to glutamate excitotoxicity  <cit> . behind this observation, the precise mechanisms involved still remain unclear. recently, it has been reported that neurons of the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, expressing low levels of nnos, are highly vulnerable to degeneration,  <cit> . other studies have shown that nnos activity increases in several brain regions of aged samp <dig>  samp <dig> and rats  <cit>  suggesting that the increase production in no can lead to an increased release of glutamate in the brain with aging  <cit> . on the other hand, studies have reported that inos expression is altered in ad and is implicated in the formation of plaques and fibrillary tangles  <cit> . several mechanisms are involved in the neurotoxic effects exerted by no. this free radical can combine with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, another highly destructive radical moiety. the resultant ros can induce oxidative stress and cause lipid peroxydation, functional alterations in proteins and dna and an eventual neuronal death. a dysfunction of ca2+ homeostasis supports also the link between no and ad since ca2+ is the primary regulator of nnos expression  <cit> . furthermore, a relation between amyloid-β  on no production has been discussed. recently, it has been reported the contribution of aβ the cognitive decline in the aged samp <dig>  since a reduction of aβ by antibody or antisense oligonucleotides, reduces oxidative stress and improves learning and memory  <cit> . our present results extend the observation that nnos may be involved in the oxidative stress observed in the brain of samp <dig> and highlight the possibility that reduced no/nnos synthesis within the hippocampus at an early age may be a marker of vulnerability. these points need further investigations based on behavioral tests coupled with histochemical and/or biochemical analyses. concerning the brainstem-sleep structures, our data support the idea that the sleep deterioration observed in the samp <dig>  may result from complementary inos and nnos alterations i.e a down-regulation of inos  <cit>  concomitant with an activation of nnos activity at an early age. by contrast, evidence supports the hypothesis that the no synthesis derived from inos activity and its release, taking place within the brainstem, play a determinant role in the regulation of the sleep-wake states in samr <dig> aging normally  <cit> .

finally, no emerges as a bi-functional regulator of apoptosis but, in the brain, it exerts only a pro-apoptotic effect during aging. although the mechanisms behind its action have been investigated, the downstream mediators in no-induced apoptosis are not yet well defined. nonetheless, it has been reported that a high no production, by up-regulation of nnos expression promotes bcl-2-linked apoptosis in the cortex of samp <dig> and causes an accelerated aging of the brain  <cit> . however, there is no significant difference in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein p <dig> content values between samp <dig> and samr <dig>  <cit>  as observed in samp <dig> . more recently, it has been suggested that other factors such as low glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  as well as other neurotrophines such as neurotrophine- <dig> and nerve growth factor  <cit>  are involved in hippocampal dysfunction and neuronal death  in samp <dig>  regarding other structures, several indices of oxidative stress as well as alpha synuclein and hyperphosphorylated tau protein could rely to the senescence-related impairments and neurodegeneration in samp <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
many alterations of the gene expression and protein abnormalities, such as deposition of aβ-peptide, with relevance to age-related cognitive decline have been found in the brain of samp <dig>  interestingly, all studies support the hypothesis that oxidative stress leads to cognitive dysfunction. our present findings together with previous data  <cit>  demonstrate that samp <dig> unlike samr <dig> are really exposed at an early stage of their life to alterations of the no metabolism. therefore, we propose that concomitant variations occurring in no levels derived from nnos and inos at an early age constitute a major factor of risk for sleep and/or memory impairments.
