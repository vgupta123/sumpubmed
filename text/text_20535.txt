BACKGROUND
the control of diseases associated with highly variable rna viruses requires close monitoring of the variant virus types that periodically dominate in viral populations. this is due to high mutation rates, quasispecies dynamics and population bottlenecks that often accompany virus transmission . indeed, rna viruses replicate with mutation rates in the range of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> substitutions per nucleotide copied  <cit> . as a consequence, rna virus populations consist of complex and dynamic distributions of related genomes termed viral quasispecies  <cit> . viral quasispecies can influence viral pathogenesis  <cit> , and the response to antiviral treatments  <cit> . mutant clouds in infected organisms represent the first stage in the natural genetic and antigenic diversification of viruses  <cit> . a consequence which is relevant to viral diagnosis and surveillance is that a transmission bottleneck may result in the establishment in the recipient host of one  variant sampled from the mutant cloud that replicates in the infected donor. therefore, methodology to discern among minor variants of the same viral genotype or serotype is essential for epidemiological surveillance and the planning of disease control strategies.

an important animal pathogen which participates of quasispecies dynamics, transmission bottlenecks, and the potential for rapid evolution is foot-and-mouth disease virus , the etiological agent of the economically most devastating disease of farm animals . fmdv is an aphthovirus of the family picornaviridae, whose genome is a single stranded rna of about  <dig> nucleotides, of positive polarity, replicated by a virus-coded rna-dependent rna polymerase, devoid of a proofreading-repair activity  <cit> . the antigenic variation of fmdv is a direct consequence of its genetic variation during natural infections, confirmed by many experiments in vivo and in cell culture  <cit> . inactivated virus vaccines are used to control fmd, but their efficacy is limited by the antigenic variation of the virus  <cit> . the antigenic diversity of fmdv is reflected in the occurrence of seven serotypes , and multiple subtypes and variants that defy classification due to the continuous recognition of mutant forms in replicating fmdv quasispecies  <cit> . in vaccination-challenge experiments no cross-protection is observed among representatives of a different serotype, and only partial protection among some subtypes and variants  <cit> . therefore, continuous monitoring of circulating antigenic forms is required to prepare vaccines whose antigenic composition matches that of the circulating virus  <cit> .

antigenic variants of fmdv have been classically diagnosed by immunological methods  . recently, several methods based on reverse transcription-pcr  amplification have been adapted to the diagnosis of fmdv  <cit> . some of these methods can be applied without the need to grow the virus in cell culture. more recently, a fmd dna chip containing  <dig> oligonucleotide probes to detect simultaneously the seven fmdv serotypes has been described  <cit> . several studies have documented that long oligonucleotide dna microarrays can detect simultaneously many viral pathogens  <cit> . multiple oligoprobes were used to characterize the heterogeneous composition and recombination forms of human poliovirus  <cit> . these results encourage the development of a new microarray-based approach to probe the fine genetic and antigenic composition of fmdv for diagnosis, vaccine design, and to gain insight into the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen.

a major antigenic site of fmdv  is located at the mobile, exposed g-h loop of capsid protein vp <dig>  <cit> . this loop includes several epitopes involved in binding of neutralizing antibodies, as well as an arg-gly-asp  triplet that participates in recognition of integrin receptors  <cit> . the overlap of residues involved in receptor recognition and antibody binding implies that variations at the g-h loop of vp <dig> can have consequences both for the antigenic behavior of the virus and its host range  <cit> . for fmdv of serotype c multiple variants at the epitopes located within antigenic site a were documented among natural populations of the virus. furthermore, studies in cell culture have shown that fmdv can evolve towards variants with altered rgd that display a remarkable expansion of host cell tropism  <cit> . the several biological implications of the g-h loop of vp <dig> prompted us to develop a dna oligonucleotide microarray to probe multiple genetic variants of fmdv, around vp <dig> residues  <dig> to  <dig> . we report assay conditions that have been optimized to detect the presence of several point mutants at this major antigenic site of fmdv, and develop a support vector machine -based procedure to automatize sample classification hybridization intensities and to set up limits for reliable diagnosis.

RESULTS
specificity and sensitivity optimization of fmdv microarray
in a first approach,  <dig> dna oligonucleotides were designed for the set up of an fmdv microarray. they represent rna sequences encoding the g-h  loop of c-s8c <dig> fmdv. two variants   of fmdv were initially tested. a microarray with both fmdv variants was printed to analyze the influence of long  versus short  oligonucleotides, the presence or absence of  <dig> spacers, and the oligonucleotide concentration. a number of conclusions were drawn from the results . first, the hybridization signals were weaker with oligonucleotides of  <dig> residues than with oligonucleotides of  <dig> residues. we have not assessed oligonucleotides longer than  <dig> residues because they are more likely to accommodate, without destabilization of the helical duplex, a single nucleotide mismatch at a central position  <cit> . the second observation was that oligonucleotides linked through a  <dig> track hybridized more efficiently than those without the track in agreement with previous results  <cit> . third, the experiments indicated that the amount of oligonucleotide attached at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm was not limiting for detection of fluorescent dnas. we chose the highest concentration tested for the standard protocol. preliminary experiments showed also that hybridization solutions including 50% formamide resulted in poor sensitivity, and that the unyhib solution  produced results comparable to those obtained with the hybridization solution described in methods. to generate labeled targets, two different systems were used: direct labeling with cy3-dutp and cy5-dutp, and indirect labeling with alexa fluor 647; the latter proved easier, more reproducible, efficient and yielded targets showing higher stability.

a step-wise increase of hybridization temperatures, between 48°c and 62°c, was tested. low temperatures resulted in poor microarray performance due to high number of false positives. the optimal point mutation discrimination was obtained between 58°c and 60°c. higher temperatures resulted in a progressive and significant loss of signal. similar comparisons revealed 45°c as the most adequate temperature for washing the hybridized microarrays. a scheme of the entire procedure with indication of the steps for which variables were screened is depicted in figure  <dig> 

screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site a of fmdv c-s8c1
a total of  <dig> positions within genomic residues  <dig> to  <dig> were analyzed by constructing 15-mer oligonucleotides with the queried nucleotide  located at position  <dig> to  <dig> in each 15-mer . forty-one oligonucleotides were spotted in duplicate, distributed in  <dig> rows and  <dig> columns per grid . a conserved fmdv sequence was used as positive control for the hybridization . two unrelated hiv oligonucleotides  and spots with no nucleotide  were used as negative control. the same pattern containing spots with 15-mers corresponding to the different queried and control mutants, and positive  and negative  controls were printed four times per slide.

rt-pcr products obtained with rna from each of  <dig> mab sd6-escape mutants of fmdv as template and primers 5'p-1r1l and pul, were treated with lambda exonuclease, and labeled with alexa fluor  <dig> as detailed in methods. the labeled dna was hybridized in the microarray, as described in methods.

five oligonucleotides were designed to identify the wild-type c-s8c <dig> sequence at the following positions:  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in the rgd panel good signal intensity was obtained at four of the positions tested ; only the hybridization with s <dig> oligonucleotide produced a low signal.

four mutants at position  <dig> were tested. each mutant could be identified due to a high signal in the perfect match probe. no crosshybridization with g139t, g139c or s <dig> was detected .

two point mutants at vp <dig> position  <dig>  rrd and red, as well as a double mutant for the  <dig> and  <dig> positions , were available for testing. hybridizations with each mutant generated positive signals with the wild-type oligonucleotides that did not include positions  <dig> and  <dig>  however, hybridizations were positive with the probe that identified specifically each mutant, but not with the probe that represented the wild-type rgd sequence .

position  <dig> is represented by four sd6-escape mutants: rgg, rgn, rgv and rge. each of them, as well as substitutions at position  <dig> , produced the expected signal. substitutions at position  <dig> were perfectly discriminated with the oligonucleotides designed in the microarray  with a slightly weak signal with the s <dig> probe. the three mutants analyzed at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  named h146r, h146p and l147p, showed an adequate signal for specific identification, and no crosshybridization with other probes at the same position.

the results  indicate a good discrimination between positive and negative signals as well as strong signals in the icf probe and no signal in any of the negative controls , as expected from the perfect match and mismatch hybridization signals, respectively. however, the hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific negative and positive signals as well as crosshybridization signals, which are of different intensity depending on the hybridization kinetics of each probe and target. therefore, an array classification method was developed to evaluate the hybridization signals.

microarray quantification and quality control of hybridization signals
procedures for microarray quantification, quality control of hybridization intensities, and data classification were applied to the microarray signals, as described in methods. jack-knife tests yielded a class averaged classification accuracy of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. table  <dig> shows classification accuracy per variant. most variants are predicted above 95% accuracy. exceptions include phenotypes rge <dig> and rgv, with about 93% prediction accuracy. in order to study the distribution of errors, a confusion matrix is shown in table  <dig>  the matrix reveals that the small fraction of errors observed shows a systematic distribution. thus, misclassified rge samples are systematically classified as s139t samples, while a misclassified rgv sample is classified within the rgd variant, and a misclassified v <dig> sample is assigned to the red mutant. most likely, the observed errors have their origin in hybridization artefacts, and will probably be corrected in future versions of the chip. nevertheless the achieved accuracy is already satisfactory in all cases for practical applications.

discussion
a microarray-based method to type representatives of the seven serotypes of fmdv has been developed by baxi and colleagues  <cit> . the microarray contained  <dig> oligonucleotide probes, of  <dig> to  <dig> residues from the vp3-vp1-2a-coding region of the fmdv genome. we have now used a specific approach based on a microarray platform aimed at distinguishing point mutants within an important determinant of antigenicity and host cell tropism, namely the g-h loop of capsid protein vp <dig> . several preliminary experiments showed a notorious decrease in the quality of results using aldehyde coated slides, streptavidine coated magnetic beads to obtain single-stranded dna or a formamide hybridization solution. additionally, other conditions involving nucleotide probes of different length, presence or absence of spacers between the array substrate and the probe, and different labeling and hybridization conditions were tested. the best signal to noise ratios and the most reproducible results were achieved using 15-mer with oligo  <dig> spacer and  <dig> μm concentrated oligonucleotide probes, with the queried position located towards the center of the probe, printed of super-epoxi-coated slides . hybridization and washing temperatures were also selected after systematic preliminary experiments.

to assess the reproducibility of the results, the classification accuracy was evaluated statistically using jack-knife simulations. this procedure revealed a high and stable degree of classification accuracy, although  <dig> variants were misclassified in more than 5% of cases. this was probably due to heterogeneity in the intensity of the hybridization reactions . despite this limitation in the reliable identification of some variants, the results illustrate the feasibility of a microarray approach to diagnose specific virus variants that may be associated with altered biological behaviors. thus, the queried mutation was accurately discriminated from other mutations at the same site . in particular, the conserved l <dig> in vp <dig> is thought to be essential for integrin recognition of fmdv  <cit> , and several substitutions at position  <dig> affect the interaction of fmdv of serotype c with antibodies. a variant with substitution l147p was isolated from a lesion of partially immunized cattle and had a profound effect on the antigenicity and tropism of fmdv  <cit> . this important l147p variant was correctly detected by the microarray. crosshybridizations were observed with the probes to identify mutations that affect vp <dig> positions  <dig> and  <dig> , expected from the high degree of overlap among these probes. this crosshybridization can be defined as the signal obtained when at least  <dig> nucleotides of a probe are perfect match with the target. for instance, mutant rgn shows a weak signal with the rgg probe, and the rge mutant with the l <dig> probe. the two amino acids replaced in those variants are also essential for integrin recognition of fmdv  <cit> .

despite the bulk of microarray technology being used to define patterns of gene expression, increasing applications are found in the detection of genetic polymorphisms  <cit> . the application to discriminate among variants of fmdv is added to a number of microarray procedures used in virology to analyze multiple viral pathogens that belong to different virus families  <cit> , to detect specific viruses  <cit>  or to define genetic variations underwent by viruses  <cit>  . microarray technology has been also used to probe differences in the structure of hepatitis c virus rna, that result from genetic differences that may be associated with different responses to interferon treatment  <cit> .

the distinction among mutants of the same virus is becoming increasingly necessary in view of the extensive variation among representatives of most virus groups  <cit> , the quasispecies population structure of rna viruses and some dna viruses  <cit> , and the increasing recognition that one or a limited number of mutations in a viral genome can have a profound effect in its biological behavior . in this report, we have documented that dna microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the fmdv genome, and have successfully devised a svm-based method to classify the samples on the basis of their hybridization signal. the procedure is of general applicability as a test for specificity and discriminatory power of microarray-based diagnostic procedures using multiple probes. we are currently investigating an extension of the same methodology to detect minority genomes in viral populations, as a means to quantify mutant spectrum complexity, and to evaluate memory levels in viral quasispecies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we have documented that dna microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the fmdv genome encoding relevant functions in antigenicity and receptor recognition. we have successfully devised a support vector machine -based method to classify the samples on the basis of their hybridization signal. the bioinformatic procedure is of general applicability to fine genotyping, including studies of heterogeneous viral populations, genetic changes in virus, bacteria, and genes of rapidly evolving cells, such as tumoral cells.
