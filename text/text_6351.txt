BACKGROUND
evolutionary adaptability in biological systems is often the result of trade-offs between flexibility and specialization  <cit> . in this context, buffering mutations and noise seem an important requirement for stability. this can be achieved by a robust response to parameter changes and correlates with the degree of specialization of the given structure. a given network insensitive to mutations will always perform the same function. on the other hand, adaptation and evolvability requires flexible structures that can be re-used to perform different  functions and thus provide plasticity  <cit> . the problem here is often understanding why some particular structures are so common and what their  functional meaning is. this is closely tied to the mapping f between structure s and function f, namely the relationship:

  s →ff 

which is usually dubbed as the genotype-phenotype mapping problem  <cit> . understanding the nature and origins of this mapping is at the core of many key questions concerning the evolution of complexity in nature.

within the context of gene transcription networks, it has been suggested that the previous problem can be dissected by analyzing the frequency of some overabundant sub-networks of three or four elements, so called network motifs  <cit> . these sub-graphs only capture the topological pattern of connections and a dynamical description of their potential function requires a set of differential equations  <cit> . one particularly important example is provided by feed-forward loop  motifs  <cit> . many genetic and biochemical systems, such as the lac and che systems in e. coli  involve ffl motifs  <cit> . mounting evidence indicates that they have key roles in cell function  <cit>  and morphogenesis  <cit> .

however, the origin of a preferential bias towards given topologies remains under discussion.

the relative frequency of ffls displays a well-defined pattern  dominated by two sub-graphs . the uneven abundance of these graphs could be a fingerprint of their functional relevance  <cit> . such importance would be the blueprint of an evolutionary advantage, but it is not clear whether such functional connection really exists  <cit>  or if it resembles instead a byproduct of non-adaptive processes  <cit> . as shown below, motif structure does not directly relate to its frequency, but its plasticity in implementing different functions does.

RESULTS
probability distribution of implementing different functions
consider the ffl graphs Γi from the set s={c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> i <dig> i <dig> i <dig> i4} shown in figure 1a. in previous studies  <cit>  it has been shown that, the topology of a given ffl does not univocally define its function but it captures the probability distribution of implementing different functions. our first goal is to identify an appropriate mapping f between ffl topology and each potential response ϕj, i.e. fij : {Γi, x, μ} → ϕj where we indicate as {Γi, x,μ} the ffl graph together with its initial condition x and the set of parameters used μ  <cit> . the six different responses  are triggered by an external input. these are either fast response  or delayed response  considering the target concentration of the output. here fij indicates the likelihood that ϕj is implemented by Γi.

how likely is a motif to become part of a complex cellular network? two extreme strategies can be envisioned. in the first, specific motifs play specific roles in a robust way and they are common because they are insensitive to mutational noise. in the second, the larger the variety of implementable functions, the more flexible the better. such a scenario is feasible under the premise of ever-changing environments and comes with the cost of reduced robustness. in order to measure the plasticity of decision-making between these two strategies, let us first determine the  probability fij = p. these probabilities are normalized, i. e. ∑{ϕj}p= <dig> and can be systematically computed  <cit> . this set actually defines our structure-function map, namely

  Γi →fijϕj 

and can be displayed  as a weighted, motif-function bipartite graph . the graph reveals that most motifs implement all functions, but the likelihood of each pair is case-dependent. some motifs seem clearly more specialized  whereas others are rather generalists . what influences the choice of a given topology over others? since most of the functions can be implemented, it is not clear that a one-to-one, function-based argument will work. but we can go a step beyond and look at the structure of the probability distribution {p} of each topology. this can be done by measuring the degree of homogeneity displayed, for each Γi, by plotting p. if the motif is highly specialized, some dominant peak would be observed, whereas if it is very flexible no prominent peaks will appear. a simple way of measuring the homogeneity of the distribution is given by its kurtosis, defined as the fourth standardized moment by

  k=k4k22- <dig> 

kurtosis is the measure of the "peakedness" of a distribution. it quantifies the concentration of frequencies around the mean of the distribution. higher kurtosis means that the variance is the result of infrequent, extreme deviations from the mean as opposed to frequent, modestly sized deviations resulting in low kurtosis. in order to define a measure characterizing the degree of plasticity of a given motif in terms of its specialization or its flexibility, we can consider two extreme cases, namely the most flexible graph Γf equally likely to implement any function ϕj, and the most specialized graph Γs implementing only one function ϕ <dig>  in the first case we would have p = 1/ <dig> and the kurtosis associated is k = - <dig> , whereas in the second case we would have p =  <dig> and  <dig> otherwise, with kurtosis k =  <dig>  details on the calculation can be found in methods. any other ffl graph Γi from the set s={c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> c <dig> i <dig> i <dig> i <dig> i4} has kurtosis values locating within this interval, k ∈ , k).

in order to measure the degree of plasticity in the decision-making between these extreme cases we introduce ψ. ψ is the distance between the absolute value of the kurtosis k and the origin k <dig>  <cit>  or in other words represents the intermediate level between specialization and flexibility. this transformation opens the way for a more intuitive biological interpretation: the values for ψ range between high plasticity ) and high commitment towards one of the extreme strategies, i.e. maximal specialization or maximal flexibility ). the optimal solution here is likely to be strongly impacted by the predictability of the environment. as a first approximation we therefor place k <dig> at the midpoint of the interval , i.e.

  ψ=|k|-k <dig> 

finally we define the likelihood ρ of a given motif Γi to appear within a network as a function of its ψ. assuming that a high degree of flexibility or specialization should be related with lower likelihood of appearance for a given motif Γi, we write

  ρ=1αψ- <dig> 

where α is a normalization coefficient defined as α=∑j=18ψ- <dig> 

this function actually defines the expected probability of finding a given sub-graph and is thus mapping between the distributions associated to each motif and the expected abundance of motifs within networks. figures 3a and 3b show the correlation between relative abundances of ffl motifs in e. coli and s. cerevisiae with respect to their expected probabilities ρ. the matching is striking . the two most abundant graphs  are consistent with our results and the actual distribution matches well the observed pattern.

interestingly, the expected probabilities indicate a positive bias toward systems which show high plasticity as presented in figure  <dig>  intermediate values for kurtosis  or low ψ  correlate with an increase in the likelihood of appearance. the values for kurtosis, ψ and ρ are collected in table  <dig>  as an alternative measure for the homogeneity of a probability distribution the shannon entropy is discussed in the methods section, where the motif's entropy is used to characterize the degree of flexibility or specialization of a given motif Γi  <cit> . both, entropy  and kurtosis  yield similar results, ranking the most abundant motifs with intermediate values which translates to high functional plasticity.

for the less abundant motifs we see a more disordered trend in the two measures, as is the case for c <dig>  c <dig>  i <dig>  or c <dig> . the interpretation here is not straightforward. it is feasible that the disordered trends can be consequence of non-adaptive processes. an alternative hypothesis is related to the shape of the real distributions for the implementation of any function. we assume that for more and less frequent motifs the analytically deduced probability distributions does not fit equally well the real counterpart. the more abundant the motif, the better the underlying probability distribution is mirrored in its abundance, because the sampling space is covered more readily.

our analysis of ffls dynamics was performed considering single, isolated motifs. however, in real systems motifs are embedded in large networks allowing for the combination of motifs. the combination of more abundant motifs, such as c <dig> and i <dig>  can cover the whole set of possible dynamics by that affecting the abundance of the rest of the motifs.

evolvability
in order to have a relevant role in evolvability, the degree of plasticity of ffls should correlate with the motif's capacity of generating phenotypic variation by exploring different functions under mutation. two key aspects are of importance here, namely i) the reduction of mutational lethality and ii) the up-speeding of adaptational processes . the evolvability of the circuits Γk can be studied by calculating the transition probabilities ωkm of shifting from function ϕi to ϕj under m mutations. the matrix Ωm= defines a flow graph  which allows us quantifying its evolvability ε. we compared the robustness against single mutations versus sequential accumulation of multiple mutations. mutations m are defined as single parameter changes. for better understanding of the procedure, we want to stress the conceptual difference of continuous real mutations and the here applied parameter changes m which result in a discretized observation pattern. in the presented framework a mutation m can be both, numerically small or large without impact as long as it does not drive the system into another functional regime.

robustness is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of Ωm, i. e. ∑iωkm. the diagonal elements ωkm give the probabilities of performing the same function after m mutations. a detailed description of the procedure is given in methods. we have found that ffl motifs are very robust but some of them exhibit a high phenotypic variation under repeated mutations. the most abundant motifs, c <dig> and i <dig>  show the highest phenotypic variation. in other words, c <dig> and i <dig> can widely change their function with greater ease than the rest of the circuits facilitated by their low ψ . a network displaying little phenotypic diversity would give small values of ε whereas sub-graphs with high transition rates among states will have a high ε. as presented in figure 6a, ε correlates positively with the abundance of motifs, with c <dig> and i <dig> displaying the largest values. these results suggest that a proper degree of plasticity, in terms of a balance between flexibility and specialization, is the optimal strategy to increase evolvability providing the playground for adaptive responses without increasing mutational lethality.

assuming that motif plasticity is a relevant trait, our analysis supports the idea that the observed ffl abundance pattern actually correlates with motif evolvability.

our analysis suggests that neither a direct interpretation of motifs as functional modules  <cit>  nor a purely non-adaptive view of their abundance  <cit>  account for the uneven presence in transcription networks. consistently with previous works  <cit>  duplication-rewiring dynamics alone cannot explain the evolution of ffls. the potential for evolvability associated to their topological structure might well be the missing ingredient connecting both views.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we have interpreted a simplified, qualitative model of the ffl motif. the thorough analysis within the model framework allows to reconstruct its natural abundance pattern and provides insight in what might have shaped it. the argument leads to the very core of the genotype-phenotype mapping problem, since, due to its simplicity, a perfect mapping between the topology and all possible functions it can implement can be constituted. we claim, however, general applicability. ffl abundances are correlated with their plasticity and evolvability. evolvability has been defined as a compromise between robustness against single mutations and the capability to modify the functional response upon increasing mutational pressure. the results indicate that a proper portion of intrinsic functional plasticity, which can be understood as a strategic trade-off between specialization and flexibility, is necessary to be abundant. because only then one is suited to be readily evolvable in changing environments.

future work should be devoted to analyzing how the coexistence of different motifs embedded in a large network affects their dynamics and abundance compared to the single motif analysis performed in this work.
