BACKGROUND
bacterial iron acquisition is tightly controlled in order to ensure adequate iron uptake to support cellular survival and growth while preventing an over-accumulation of iron leading to oxidative damage  <cit> . to promote iron homeostasis, most genes involved in iron uptake mechanisms are only abundantly expressed under conditions of low intracellular iron, and are typically repressed when the cell is replete with iron. in escherichia coli, one of the major regulators of iron homeostasis is the protein fur , a homodimeric protein with 17 kda subunits . given its central role in regulating iron homeostasis and oxidative stress, fur, along with the small rna ryhb, are known virulence factors in a number of pathogenic bacterial species that require iron from host organisms  <cit> . fur, in the iron-bound holo form, binds tightly to a recognition site known as the fur box. although there is variation in fur box sequences, they all share identity with a 19-bp consensus sequence 5′-atcattatc)-3′  <cit> . in addition to its classical role as a repressor, holo-fur has been reported to activate a number of gene targets  <cit> . a recent genome-wide study has also reported that fur regulates  <dig> genes in e. coli, both by apo- and holo-fur activation and holo-fur repression  <cit> . in the classical holo-fur repression mechanism, iron-bound fur binds to a fur box sequence that overlaps with, or is proximal to, promoters of iron-responsive genes, thus preventing their transcription  <cit> . when intracellular iron is depleted, fe2+ is released from fur, causing conformational changes in the protein resulting in dissociation from the fur box  <cit> . this de-repression results in the up-regulation of fur-controlled genes. numerous genes are controlled by holo-fur, including those that encode:  proteins involved in siderophore-mediated iron uptake  <cit> ,  small rnas such as ryhb that regulate bacterial iron uptake  <cit> ,  some tca cycle enzymes  <cit> ,  superoxide dismutase  <cit> , and  fur itself  <cit> .

here we report a novel set of vectors that contain the e. coli fepb-entc promoter region that has two bidirectional fur box sequences  identified from previous studies . fur box  <dig>  and fur box  <dig>  differ from the consensus sequence by  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively . when incorporated into the vectors, this region controls plasmid-borne protein expression by fur de-repression upon iron restriction. they can be used for iron-controlled expression of any subcloned orf, even those not typically found under fur control. we designed these vectors for expression of epitope-tagged proteins using an mcs compatible with the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid  system, allowing for subcloning of orfs of interest from a bacth system to the fur-controlled protein expression system reported here. proteins expressed from these vectors contain cleavable n-terminally fused epitope tags  that are useful for various immunochemical approaches.fig.  <dig> the intercistronic bidirectional promoter region between e. coli fepb and entc. a the sequence contains all nucleotides between the fepb and entc start codons . positions of anti-clockwise regulatory elements  are indicated by dashed lines. positions of clockwise regulatory elements  are shown as solid lines. fur box  <dig> and fur box  <dig> were identified previously  <cit> . b sequence alignment of the fur box consensus sequence with fur box  <dig> and fur box  <dig>  positions diverging from the consensus sequence are highlighted

RESULTS
construction of pfcf <dig>  pfcf <dig> and pfbh1
the vector pfcf <dig> was constructed by inserting gblock <dig>  into a pacyc <dig> backbone. gblock <dig> encodes the bidirectional fur promoter region  followed by a downstream flag epitope tag sequence, tev protease cleavage site, and a multiple cloning site  . we used the put18c mcs sequence  for subcloning of orfs from bacth vectors directly into pfcf <dig>  iron-starved e. coli transformants harboring orfs subcloned into pfcf <dig> would thus express recombinant proteins with cleavable n-terminal flag tags. the map of pfcf <dig> is shown in fig. 2b. we also generated pfcf <dig>  a pfcf1-derived vector, to demonstrate bidirectional expression of two proteins from the plasmid-borne fepb/entc promoter region. to construct pfcf <dig>  we designed gblock <dig> , which contains an in-frame ha tag sequence upstream of the kanamycin resistance gene  that encodes neomycin-kanamycin phosphotransferase ii  <cit> . to generate pfcf <dig>  gblock <dig> was synthesized and then inserted between the ncoi and scai sites of pfcf <dig>  the map of pfcf <dig> is shown in fig. 2c. the vector pfbh <dig> was constructed by insertion of gblock <dig>  between the ecori and sali sites of linearized pbr <dig>  gblock <dig> contained dna encoding the bidirectional fur promoter region , the ha tag sequence, a tev protease cleavage site, and the mcs from put18c . the pfbh <dig> vector  allows for iron-controlled expression of recombinant proteins with cleavable n-terminal ha tags.fig.  <dig> vector maps of pfcf <dig> and pfcf <dig>  a polypeptide sequence immediately downstream of the bidirectional promoter region found in gblock <dig>  start codon sequence: black, flag sequence: green, tev cleavage sequence: blue. mcs region from put18c colored by codons with restriction endonuclease sites shown below sequence. b pfcf <dig> vector map. light blue bar indicates the promoter region. unique restriction endonuclease sites shown in bold. flag: flag tag sequence; tev: tev cleavage site; tcr: tetracycline resistance gene; p15a ori: origin of replication. c pfcf <dig> vector map. light blue bar indicates the promoter region. unique restriction endonuclease sites shown in bold. ha: ha tag sequence; neor/kanr: neomycin/kanamycin resistance gene

assessment of iron-responsive promoter regions
to determine functionality of pfcf <dig>  pfcf <dig>  and pfbh <dig>  we subcloned orfs encoding e. coli enterobactin biosynthetic enzymes into the mcs regions of these vectors and performed complementation experiments using relevant knockout strains. genes encoding the enterobactin biosynthetic enzymes enta, ente, and entb were prepared by pcr amplification from pca24n-based constructs as reported previously  <cit> . specifically, the enta gene was subcloned into pfcf <dig> and pfcf <dig> to produce pfcf1-enta and pfcf2-enta. the ente gene was subcloned into pfcf <dig> to produce pfcf1-ente. finally, the entb gene was subcloned into pfbh <dig> to produce pfbh1-entb. the four constructs were transformed into respective enta−, ente− and entb−e. coli knockout strains, and cas assays  <cit>  were used to assess complementation of the knockout phenotype . the cas assay is a classical technique used to detect for the presence of siderophores. upon iron chelation by siderophores, a color change of a dye complex  is observed. transformants containing pfcf1-enta and pfcf- <dig> enta in an enta− background were observed to produce orange halos indicative of iron chelation due to functional enterobactin biosynthesis whereas no halos were observed for empty vector controls . similar results were found for the pfcf1-ente transformant in the ente− background , as well as for the pfbh1-entb transformant in the entb− background . growth studies  were consistent with our cas assay results. low growth was observed for enta− and ente−e. coli strains transformed with pfcf <dig> . these knockout strains were rescued by transformation with pfcf1-enta and pfcf1-ente, respectively . an entb− strain transformed with pfbh <dig> also exhibited low growth , while transformation with pfbh1-entb complemented the knockout phenotype . consistent with the above results, the enta− strain transformed with pfcf <dig> did not exhibit significant growth in iron-depleted medium , whereas the pfcf2-enta transformant grew well .fig.  <dig> functional assays for pfcf <dig>  pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  a cas assays. images are photographs of cas agar plates spotted with various e. coli transformants. enterobactin secretion is indicated by orange halos. upper left panel: e. coli enta

iron-controlled protein expression
to investigate iron-controlled protein expression from pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  we performed western blotting analysis on isolated soluble proteins from iron-starved e. coli cells transformed with pfcf1-enta and pfbh1-entb. in addition, we used pfcf <dig> to examine iron-controlled expression of a protein not related to iron metabolism. for this experiment we used the dna encoding t <dig>  part of the catalytic fragment of adenylate cyclase from b. pertussis  <cit>  to produce pfcf1-t <dig>  proteins from whole-cell lysates  of transformants were separated by sds-page and the presence of epitope-tagged recombinant proteins was detected by western blotting using appropriate antibodies directed against epitope tags. expression of flag-tagged enta from pfcf1-enta was detected using an anti-flag antibody . as a negative control, untransformed lysate was probed with anti-flag antibody and no signal was observed . epitope signals were also observed for flag-tagged t <dig> expressed from pfcf1-t <dig>  and ha-tagged entb expressed from pfbh1-entb . proteins recovered from untransformed lysate probed with anti-ha antibody resulted in no observable signal .fig.  <dig> protein expression from pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  a whole-cell lysates from iron-starved e. coli bw <dig> transformants  were analyzed by western blotting. an anti-flag antibody was used to detect expression of flag-enta  and flag-t <dig> . untransformed cell lysate probed with anti-flag antibody ). b western blot of iron-starved e. coli bw <dig> lysates probed with anti-ha antibody. left lane: e. coli bw <dig> transformed with pfbh1-entb. right lane: untransformed cell lysate . c iron responsiveness of the bidirectional promoter region. upper panel: anti-flag antibody was used to detect expression of flag-ente in lysates from cells grown in minimal m <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> '-dipyridyl  and from cells grown in lb medium supplemented with feso <dig> . lower panel: anti-gapdh antibody was used to detect expression of e. coli gapdh from protein samples identical to those in the upper panel



to determine that the fepb/entc fur promoter region was iron-responsive, we grew e. coli bw <dig> cells transformed with pfcf1-ente under iron-rich conditions using lb medium supplemented with feso <dig> as well as under iron-restricted conditions using modified m <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig> ′-dipyridyl. cells were recovered from respective overnight cultures and equivalent amounts of proteins from whole-cell lysates were separated by sds-page. western blot analysis using an anti-flag antibody revealed that flag-ente was only detected in cells grown in iron-depleted medium, whereas no signal was observed from transformants grown in iron-rich medium . as a control, proteins from identical lysate loadings were probed with an anti-gapdh antibody. comparable gapdh signals were observed in lysates from cells grown in both iron-depleted and iron-rich media .

iron-controlled bidirectional expression from pfcf2
to test for bidirectional protein expression, we subcloned the e. coli enta gene into the mcs of pfcf <dig>  which is under the control of fur box  <dig>  the pfcf <dig> vector also contains the kanr gene oriented in the opposite direction, under the control of fur box  <dig>  the resulting pfcf2-enta construct was transformed into competent e. coli bw <dig> enta− and transformants were grown in either iron-rich  medium or iron-depleted  medium in the presence and absence of kanamycin. growth studies on pfcf2-enta transformants revealed that transformants grown in iron-depleted media supplemented with tetracycline grew to similar densities in the presence or absence of kanamycin . conversely, transformants grown in iron-rich media supplemented with tetracycline grew poorly in the presence of kanamycin  due to fur repression under iron-replete conditions.fig.  <dig> bidirectional expression from pfcf <dig>  iron-controlled expression from the anti-clockwise-oriented kanr gene in pfcf <dig> was determined by bacterial growth studies. shown are normalized cell densities  of e. coli enta

discussion
we designed and constructed three vectors  for iron-controlled protein expression from low-copy-number vectors in e. coli. for pfcf <dig> and pfcf <dig>  the plasmid pacyc <dig>  <cit>   was used as a backbone, whereas for pfbh <dig> the plasmid pbr <dig>  <cit>   was used. these low-copy-number plasmids were chosen as backbones in order to avoid protein overexpression found in systems employing high-copy-number plasmids, such as the pbad series of expression vectors that contain the puc origin of replication  or the ptz-derived expression vectors  <cit> . furthermore, since pfcf1/pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig> have different antibiotic resistance markers along with compatible origins of replication, expression of multiple epitope-tagged proteins from a single co-transformant is possible. for all vectors, gblock® fragments containing:  a wild-type e. coli fur-controlled bidirectional promoter region,  sequences encoding epitope tags ,  sequence encoding the tev protease cleavage site and  a bacth-compatible mcs, were designed, synthesized and inserted into respective plasmid backbones .

for iron-controlled expression of epitope-tagged proteins, we used the bidirectional promoter region in the intercistronic space between the fepb and entc genes in the e. coli chromosome   <cit> . this region, which contains all nucleotides between the fepb and entc start codons ), has two fur box sequences. fur box  <dig> controls expression of fepb in the anti-clockwise direction whereas fur box  <dig> controls expression of the operon containing entc, ente, entb, enta, and enth genes in the clockwise direction. while fur box  <dig> overlaps with its cognate −10/− <dig> sequences, fur box  <dig> occurs downstream of its cognate +1/−10/− <dig> sequences  <cit> .

in order to test the functionality of pfcf <dig>  pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  derivative constructs containing orfs  under the control of fur box  <dig> were prepared. chromosomal expression of these orfs in e. coli is under fur control, and they were therefore logical candidates for testing the plasmid-borne bidirectional promoter region in pfcf1/ <dig> and pfbh <dig>  cas assays and growth studies  confirmed that the derivative constructs were able to complement respective knockout phenotypes upon iron restriction due to fur derepression. western blotting demonstrated that the bidirectional promoter region was controlling expression of epitope-tagged proteins flag-enta and ha-entb from pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  respectively. also, expression of flag-t <dig>  a flag-tagged b. pertussis polypeptide that is typically not under control of e. coli fur, was detected. taken together, these outcomes demonstrate that the fepb/entc promoter region  is functional in pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  experiments using iron-depleted and iron-rich media showed that expression of flag-ente from pfcf1-ente occurred in an iron-controlled manner. this is consistent with recent reports demonstrating that elevated expression of genes under fur control occurred under iron-restricted conditions  <cit> .

although unidirectional protein expression controlled by fur box  <dig> was observed in pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig>  the bidirectionality of the fepb/entc promoter region had to be tested. we designed pfcf <dig> such that expression of the kanr gene would be controlled by fur box  <dig> while fur box  <dig> would simultaneously control expression of an orf subcloned into the mcs in the other direction. a pfcf2-enta transformant grown under iron-restricted conditions was expected to exhibit complementation of the enta− phenotype with concomitant kanamycin resistance. using iron-depleted cas agar plates supplemented with tetracycline and kanamycin, the pfcf2-enta transformant complemented the enta− phenotype and produced a cas halo while being resistant to kanamycin . this demonstrated that the kanr gene in pfcf2-enta was under the control of fur box  <dig> resulting in iron-regulated expression. furthermore, growth studies revealed that the pfcf2-enta transformant grew more poorly in iron-rich medium supplemented with kanamycin compared to growth in iron-depleted medium plus kanamycin. this suggests that under iron-replete conditions, fur-controlled expression of the kanr gene is repressed relative to that of the same transformant grown under iron-depleted conditions. taken together our results demonstrate that bidirectional iron-controlled in trans protein expression from pfcf2-enta occurs in iron-starved e. coli transformants. protein expression controlled by fur box  <dig> in pfcf <dig> is currently restricted to the kanr gene. by replacement of this gene with an additional mcs, bidirectional expression of any two epitope-tagged proteins can be achieved in a single transformant. the compatibility of pfcf- and pfbh-derived constructs would further allow for expression of up to four epitope-tagged proteins in a single co-transformant.

CONCLUSIONS
constructs containing engineered fur box sequences for unidirectional expression of toxic genes in e. coli have previously been reported  <cit> . to facilitate bidirectional expression of epitope-tagged proteins under iron control, we have designed and constructed three novel low-copy-number vectors derived from pacyc <dig> and pbr <dig>  these vectors contain the wild-type intercistronic region found between the fepb and entc genes in the e. coli chromosome that can be used for bidirectional expression. as we have demonstrated, when inserted into low-copy-number plasmid vectors, this region can control simultaneous expression of two proteins in a single transformant. since the pfcf1/ <dig> and pfbh <dig> have compatible origins of replication and different antibiotic resistance gene markers, they can also be useful for co-transformation.

our current understanding of fur regulation indicates that there are approximately  <dig> e. coli genes under the control of fur  <cit> . by transferring orfs naturally found in fur regulons, the vectors reported here can be used for a wide variety of experiments such as the study of in trans complementation of knockout phenotypes, effects of iron-controlled protein expression on cellular processes , as well as studies on proteins that are involved in fur-controlled virulence mechanisms   <cit> . furthermore, genes not typically under fur control can be expressed in an iron-controlled manner. since the mcs in pfcf <dig> and pfbh <dig> is compatible with the bacth system, orfs encoding interacting partners detected by bacth could be easily subcloned into the vectors reported here. such constructs could be used for follow-up studies such as co-immunoprecipitation experiments using appropriate antibodies directed against vector-encoded epitope-tagged proteins.
