BACKGROUND
pneumococcus is a major human pathogen, causing a wide range of infections from otitis media to bacteraemia and meningitis. its main virulence determinant is a polysaccharide capsule that surrounds pneumococcal cells, providing protection against phagocytosis  <cit> . together with colony morphology, susceptibility to optochin, and bile solubility, assignment of a serotype  has been traditionally the ultimate assay to identify pneumococcus  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> serotypes have been described and, with the exception of type  <dig>  the genes responsible for the expression of the capsule are located in the chromosome between the dexb and alia genes   <cit> . the pneumococcal capsule is also the target of all currently available pneumococcal vaccines  <cit> .

pneumococci lacking a polysaccharide capsule are known to exist in nature and are frequent inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract of humans  <cit> . although these isolates, often named non-typeable pneumococcus , are mostly asymptomatically carried in the nasopharynx, they have also been associated with conjunctivitis outbreaks and sporadically associated with other disease manifestations including invasive disease . studies have suggested, using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods, that some of these isolates are bona-fide pneumococci and share common properties with encapsulated pneumococci  <cit> . also, in vitro studies with non-encapsulated pneumococci have shown that these strains display increased adherence to epithelial tissue, increased capacity for biofilm formation, and are highly transformable . hence, high carriage rates combined with high transformability rates may provide nt with the features needed to play an important role in the evolution of pneumococcus as recently proposed by chewapreecha, et al.
 <cit> .

in a previous study, we have described the population structure of nt strains in portugal and identified major lineages associated with them  <cit> . in parallel, others have identified the same lineages in circulation in other geographical settings and the capsular region of nt has been characterised . based on the capsular region, nt have been proposed to be divided in two groups: group i includes isolates with a disrupted or non-functional capsular locus and group ii includes isolates with genes not found in conventional capsular types  <cit> . group ii nt have been proposed to be further divided into cps types ncc <dig>  when isolates have the pspk gene , encoding for a novel pneumococcal surface protein with several features suggesting a role in cell adhesion and enhanced colonisation, and ncc <dig>  when isolates have both the alib-like orf <dig> and alib-like orf <dig> genes, predicted to encode for lipoproteins . a cps type ncc <dig> has also been described for isolates with alib-like orf <dig> but not alib-like orf <dig>  but these were shown not to be pneumococci  <cit> .

the observation that several distinct clonal lineages lacking the capsule operon have been in circulation for decades and are not derived from encapsulated strains has raised the question of how different is the genome of these strains compared to encapsulated pneumococci  <cit> . the aim of this study was to characterise a carriage collection of nt circulating in portugal in a period of 11 years to obtain insights into the genetic basis of non-typeability and their genomic content and diversity.

RESULTS
capsular region of nt
to obtain insights into the genetic basis of non-typeability, the capsular region was characterised for a set of  <dig> nt strains representative of the lineages detected in cross-sectional colonisation studies conducted in portugal among children between  <dig> and  <dig> . amplification of this region yielded, in all strains, a fragment of  <dig> - <dig>  bp. to investigate the heterogeneity of the capsular region, restriction fragment length polymorphism  patterns were determined by digestion with hinfi. nine different patterns could be distinguished after digestion with hinfi . we then selected  <dig> isolates, representative of the different capsular rflp patterns found in each cc, for sequencing. the findings are summarised in figure  <dig> that shows a schematic organisation of the locus compared to strains previously described by hathaway, et al.  <cit> . all strains had alib-like orf <dig>  alib-like orf <dig>  and capn-like regions; eight had the doc-like region between capn-like and alia. based on the classification previously proposed by park, et al.  <cit> , the strains were therefore classified as belonging to cps type ncc2a  or ncc2b . of the eight strains belonging to cps type ncc2a, two had an insertion of a tnp region of ~ <dig>  kb between dexb and alib-like orf <dig> previously described  <cit> .table  <dig>

candidate core genome
to determine if the genome content of nt strains is comparable to that of encapsulated strains,  <dig> nt representing the diversity of profiles identified by pfge, mlst, and characterisation of the capsular region, were characterised by cgh using an array that covers the genome of nine encapsulated pneumococcal strains and r <dig>  . from the  <dig>  genes present in the array,  <dig>   were present in all nt tested,  <dig>  were present in some, and  <dig>  were absent in all . in an independent analysis, conducted in the framework of an ongoing study,  <dig> encapsulated strains were analysed by cgh. these strains were representative of  <dig> serotypes and included all strains in the array . results from this analysis were used for comparison. in this collection,  <dig>  genes  were present in all strains, the same proportion found for the nt isolates. of these  <dig>  genes,  <dig>   were also present in all nt isolates . among the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> were present in some  nt and only  <dig> were absent in all. the proportion of these  <dig> genes present in the nt strains ranged between  <dig> % and  <dig> % . the  <dig> genes with variable presence among nt strains could be grouped into the following functions:  <dig> % cellular metabolism,  <dig> % transporters,  <dig> % dna metabolism,  <dig> % phages and mobile elements,  <dig> % surface proteins,  <dig> % signalling and communication, and  <dig> % were annotated as hypothetical proteins. the six genes absent in all nt were sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> , and sp_ <dig> .

furthermore, nt isolates contained between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes detected by cgh with an average of  <dig>  genes, while the  <dig> encapsulated strains had between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes with an average of  <dig> . based on these experiments, although the size of “core” genomes of nt versus encapsulated strains was comparable, nt strains characterised in this study had  <dig> % less genes detected by cgh than encapsulated strains.

accessory regions 
to further analyse the genome content of nt strains, the presence of previously identified accessory regions was investigated   <cit> . of the  <dig> accessory regions described to date,  <dig> were present or partially present in all nt strains analysed  and  <dig> were absent in all . furthermore,  <dig> ars were present, or at least partially present, in most strains  and  <dig> ars were absent, or mostly absent, in most strains .figure  <dig>

twenty-five new ars , totalling  <dig> genes, were identified in this study. their predicted functions are described in table  <dig> and include abc transporters, type ii restriction-modification systems, phosphotransferase systems and proteins involved in metabolism, cell envelope, transport, and transcription regulation. these  <dig> ars were dispersed around the tigr <dig> genome . of these,  <dig> ars were present, or at least partially present, in most strains ,  <dig> ars were absent, or mostly absent, in most strains , and ar <dig>  was absent in all.table  <dig>

altogether, when looking for ars absent in all nt, these were found to encode for capsular genes , type-i pili , sucrose abc transporter , fucose metabolism , a putative bacteriocin , and several hypothetical proteins .

virulence factors
a total of  <dig> of the genes present on the array were identified as virulence factors of pneumococcus based on published data  . of these,  <dig>  were present in all nt strains and  <dig>  were absent in all. this latter group included genes associated with capsular synthesis , pilus islet- <dig>  the virulence proteins cbpa/pspc, pspa, nane, glf, and ntpk among others . pcr analysis of pilus islet- <dig> and - <dig> confirmed the absence of these loci in all  <dig> strains.

regarding competence-associated genes , all were present in all strains, including the recently described comg operon , encoding for a type-iv transformation pilus   <cit> . in addition, comc and comd alleles were determined by pcr for the  <dig> nt strains included in this study and a clear distinction between ccs could be observed for comcd: ccs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> encoded csp <dig> and comd2; ccs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had csp <dig> and comd1; and cc <dig> had csp <dig> and comd <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig>

nine choline binding proteins have been implicated in virulence, and all were present on the array  <cit> . of these, cbpd, cbpe/pce, lyta, lytb, and lytc were present in all strains, with cbpa/pspc and pspa being absent in all strains. variation between ccs was found for cbpf, cbpg and pcpa .

in addition,  <dig> genes implicated in colonisation were present on the array. of these, pava, eno, pyrr, strh, trpg, rr <dig>  and spy <dig> were present in all nt, while rlra was absent in all strains. clonal variation was found for genes hyl, nana, bgaa, and phou .

among other major virulence factors, ply, psaa, htra, iga, and spxb were present in all strains with variations between clones found for the operons piua-d and piaa-d and zmpb.

further details on the variable presence of virulence genes can be found in additional file  <dig> 

intraclonal variation
comparison of smai-pfge patterns of nt strains resulted in an unexpected high diversity of profiles for strains belonging to the same st   <cit> . likewise, there were also strains with similar pfge profiles belonging to different sts. this lack of concordance was puzzling, as previous studies have found a good general agreement with pfge and mlst for encapsulated pneumococci  <cit> . to investigate possible genomic variations that could account for the lack of concordance found between pfge and mlst results, cgh results were compared for strains belonging to the same cc. for any given cc, all strains analysed shared at least 72% of the genes detected in the nt pool .figure  <dig>

when we looked at intraclonal diversity, within each cc, variation between strains was mostly due to only a few  genes. still, exceptions were found: strains pt <dig> of cc <dig>  pt <dig> of cc <dig>  and dcc <dig> of cc <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively, uniquely present in their genomes compared to other strains of the same cc. also, the two strains of cc <dig> were found to differ from each other in more than  <dig> genes.

when looking for the functions of genes uniquely present in one strain of a given cc, most were found to encode for hypothetical proteins . other genes had the following functions: transport and secretion , cell metabolism , phages and mobile elements , dna metabolism , cell wall, cell membrane, and cell division , signalling and communication , and stress . furthermore, only  <dig> % of this latter group of genes have been described as virulence genes. not surprisingly, close to half of these genes were found in ars .

to investigate if the high variability of pfge types found could be due to the presence of prophages, as previously reported  <cit> , or the presence of other mobile elements, we evaluated their distribution among nt strains . in some cases, e.g. nt <dig>  nt <dig>  and nt <dig> of st <dig> or nt <dig> and nt <dig> of st <dig>  the content of mobile elements was indeed distinct between strains, which might explain the variability found. however, in other cases, such as nt <dig>  nt <dig>  nt <dig>  nt <dig>  and nt <dig> of st <dig> and nt <dig> and nt <dig> of st <dig>  the strains shared the same mobile elements. on the other hand, examples of strains belonging to the same pfge type and st but with different mobile elements’ profiles were also observed . to complement this analysis, the presence of prophages was also determined by lyta hybridisation . in st <dig>  the six pfge types tested exhibited three lyta hybridisation patterns, whereas the two st <dig> pfge types tested showed the same lyta hybridisation pattern. according to these results, the high variability of pfge types observed within sts could not be entirely explained by the presence of prophages or other mobile elements.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study we aimed to characterise the genomic content of a collection of nt strains representative of the carriage lineages circulating in portugal in a period of 11 years . strains were analysed by cgh against a panel of  <dig> pneumococcal strains and their capsular region was sequenced. according to their capsular regions, strains in this study could be classified as ncc <dig>  as they all contained alib-like genes  <cit> . strains with similar capsular regions have also been identified in carriage and disease isolates circulating in switzerland, the netherlands, uk, usa, brazil, south korea, thailand, and the gambia . in our collection we did not find isolates of cps type ncc <dig>  and we did not include nt strains derived from encapsulated lineages that had alterations in the capsular operon leading to absence of capsular production .

of interest, a recent study by park, et al. aimed to characterise invasive nt strains from the usa. the authors reported that these strains are rare, accounting for less than 1% of the invasive pneumococcal disease cases, and most are of group i nt, with only a few cases caused by ncc <dig> nt. nonetheless, it has been clearly demonstrated that ncc <dig> nt are capable of causing invasive disease and therefore should not be disregarded  <cit> .

in relation to core genome,  <dig> % of the genes represented on the array were found in all nt strains, the same proportion found for a collection of  <dig> encapsulated strains used for comparison . however, the average number of total genes detected in the nt strains  was 6% less than the corresponding value found for encapsulated strains. still, this result should be interpreted with caution as, by using a cgh approach, nt genes were probably missed to an unknown extent.

twenty-five new ars, dispersed around the tigr <dig> genome, were identified in this study. of the  <dig> ars identified to date, only seven were absent in all nt and encoded for genes associated with sugar metabolism, capsular synthesis, type-i pilus, and hypothetical proteins  <cit> . also, more than 90% of the virulence factors identified in pneumococcus were found in nt. the most relevant virulence factors absent from all nt were the capsular genes and type-i pilus , type-ii pilus, choline-binding protein a , and pneumococcal surface protein a   <cit> . also absent in the majority of nt was the major iron abc transport system piaa-d. however, piua-d, a second iron abc transport system, was present in the majority of nt. mutations in these systems have been shown to result in mild  to moderate  reduction in virulence  <cit> . together with the lack of capsule and other important virulence genes, the absence of these genes in nt should contribute to a lower propensity of nt to cause disease.

as expected, all strains had all competence genes, including the newly described transformation pilus  <cit> . according to the type of competence stimulating peptide  secreted by pneumococcal strains, strains can be divided in pherotypes. the dominant pneumococcal pherotypes are csp <dig> and csp <dig>  respectively found in 60-75% and 25-40% of carriage or clinical isolates  <cit> . in nt, the dominant pherotype was csp <dig> , with the remaining strains belonging to pherotype csp <dig>  in our study, pherotype was a clonal property, with all strains within a cc belonging to the same pherotype. the same association was previously observed in encapsulated pneumococcus  <cit> . these results further support that nt are bona-fide pneumococci, in contrast with atypical strains of ambiguous speciation, where multiple comc alleles can be found  <cit> .

to explore the reasons underlying the observation that nt had highly variable pfge profiles in contrast to relatively conserved sts, we assessed whether the presence of prophages or other mobile elements could account for these observations. although that seemed to be the case in some strains, the presence of these mobile elements could not entirely explain the variability found in nt isolates, at least with the approaches that were used. a more detailed characterisation of phage presence, such as the prophage typing system proposed by romero, et al., could have provided additional information but was beyond the purpose of this study  <cit> .

our study has a major limitation. information obtained by cgh is restricted to what is present in the array and therefore limited by nature. still, interesting information regarding variability and presence/absence of pneumococcal genes implicated in virulence was obtained, providing further hypothesis related to the low disease capacity of these strains. our study has also some strengths. the thorough characterisation of a representative collection of nt circulating in portugal for over a decade provided insight on the most frequent features of the lineages in circulation and definitely supported the inclusion of these strains as part of the pneumococcal population.

CONCLUSIONS
nt circulating in portugal are a homogeneous group belonging to cps type ncc <dig>  our observations support that this group are bona-fide pneumococcal isolates that do not express the capsule but are otherwise essentially similar to encapsulated pneumococci, having a comparable core genome and most virulence factors. given that nt are not targeted by current pneumococcal vaccines and that they are highly transformable, we recommend that these isolates are routinely identified and reported in surveillance studies monitoring pneumococcal serotype evolution.
