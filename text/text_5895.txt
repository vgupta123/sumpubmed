BACKGROUND
tumor markers have been established to detect cancer, to monitor cancer progression, to gauge responsiveness to cancer treatment, and to provide insight into tumor development. molecular tumor markers can be grouped into those that are identifiable in cancer cells and those that are secreted as molecules into body fluids. markers of the first group encompass a wide spectrum including chromosome alterations, epigenetic dna modifications, altered rna and protein expression, and protein modifications. detection of these markers requires the availability of cancer cells either obtained by tumor biopsies or by cancer cell isolation from blood or other body fluids. the isolation of cancer cells from body fluids and their use as markers is still in its early stages. the requirement of a tumor biopsy limits the usefulness of such markers for early detection of cancer. among the second group of markers the prostate specific antigen  is one of the few markers that are widely used in diagnosis and monitoring of cancer  <cit> .

however, even psa has its severe limitations both in detection and monitoring of prostate cancer. psa is found at high levels in approximately one third of the patients without prostate cancer and its benefits for monitoring after treatment remain controversial. other serum markers like ca- <dig>  for breast cancer and ca- <dig>  for pancreatic cancer also have severe limitations  <cit> . mass spectroscopy is an up-to-date method to perform minimally invasive cancer detection. a promising approach using matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization  mass spectroscopy evaluated by 'peak probability contrasts' revealed an accuracy of around 70% for ovarian cancer  <cit> . similar approaches for pancreatic cancer performed slightly better with 88% sensitivity and 75% specificity  <cit> .

the onset of autoantibody signatures paved the way not only for an improved diagnosis but also for a new kind of monitoring of molecular processes in early tumor development. wang and co-workers  <cit>  reported an autoantibody signature that allows for detection of prostate cancer with  <dig> % specificity and  <dig> % sensitivity. however, a limitation of the study was the use of many peptides with weak homology to known proteins termed mimotopes. most recently, a study of ovarian cancer based on bayesian modeling showed similarly good results  <cit> . prior to the work by erkanli and co-workers, we reported a first study that identified a complex antibody response in patients with meningioma  <cit> . here, we present a novel concept for a serum-based diagnosis of human tumors, especially in their early stages of development. we chose meningioma as a model, which is a priori not expected to trigger a complex immune response: first meningioma is a generally benign tumor, and second it is genetically rather stable. both factors do not favor a complex immune response. our approach permits the separation of meningioma sera and normal sera with high specificity and sensitivity, especially the separation of low-grade common type meningiomas  and normal controls. to reach this high performance, we screened a total of  <dig> blood samples from  <dig> meningioma patients  and  <dig> individuals without known disease  for seroreactivity with a set of  <dig> meningioma-associated antigens, i.e. antigens that were previously found in sera of meningioma patients. having screened the  <dig> sera for these antigens we can group the meningioma-associated antigens in two subgroups. antigens that are found in at least one of the  <dig> meningioma sera but not in any of the  <dig> control sera are denoted as meningioma-specific antigens. all antigens that are detected in at least one of the  <dig> meningioma sera but also in at least one of the  <dig> control sera are denoted as non-specific antigens. we show in our study that the identification of meningiomas, especially of low-grade common type meningiomas, can be carried out with a significantly decreased subset of antigens that includes meningioma-specific as well as non-specific antigens.

RESULTS
mutual information of specific and non-specific antigens
one of the original goals of our project was to define a set of meningioma-specific antigens that react with meningioma sera but not with normal sera. with increasing number of normal sera we found a decreasing number of meningioma-specific antigens as indicated in figure  <dig> 

notably,  <dig> of  <dig> antigens  are detected in meningioma sera and normal sera. one reason for the occurrence of non-specific antigens that can not be ruled out completely is false positive antigen reactivity that is of course unavoidable, especially when large numbers of sera are analyzed. any false positive antigen reactivity in a normal serum possibly converts a specific antigen into a non-specific antigen. however, our study shows that some non-specific antigens entail even more information for the diagnostic task than most of the specific antigens. the mutual information as explained in 'methods' offers an appropriate measure of the information content of an antigen. the mutual information values of all antigens are shown in figure  <dig>  for meningioma-specific antigens the mutual information ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig>  and a median of  <dig> , whereas for non-specific antigens it ranges between  <dig> and  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  and a median of  <dig> . as detailed in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  many non-specific antigens provide even more mutual information than the majority of specific antigens. an example of such an antigen is nit <dig> with a mutual information value of  <dig> . notably, such a high value is reached by only  <dig> of the  <dig> specific antigens. even more, the difference of the mutual information of specific and non-specific antigens was statistically not significant . these findings support our hypothesis, that non-specific antigens are suitable to enhance meningioma detection.

classification of sera using all antigens
we applied several standard classification methods to the complete set of  <dig> meningioma and  <dig> normal sera that were evaluated by using 10-fold cross validation. the first naïve bayes approach, introduced in the 'materials' section, reached a specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , an accuracy of  <dig> % , and an auc  value of  <dig>  . the classification result of an arbitrary selected cross-validation run is shown in figure  <dig>  the second bayes approach showed similar performance with a slightly increased specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , and an accuracy of  <dig> % . we tested the data with several other statistical learning methods  that yielded similar high-quality classification results, indicating the high information content of the antigen profiles. in order to validate our approaches, we carried out  <dig> permutation tests by randomly permuting class labels before classifying the  <dig> sera. the randomly permuted data yielded an averaged accuracy of 50%, which corresponds to random guessing. the best random test showed an accuracy of only 70%. an unpaired two-sample wilcoxon mann-whitney test yielded a p-value of smaller 10- <dig>  asserting that the above classification results can be attributed to the information content of the data set and not to chance.

classification of common type meningioma using all antigens
since we are especially interested to perform accurate diagnoses of early stages of tumor development we classified low-grade common type meningioma  sera versus normal sera. using the complete set of  <dig> antigens, common type meningioma sera are separated from normal sera with a specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , and an accuracy of  <dig> % . the respective auc value was  <dig>  . for comparison, we also classified the sera of grade ii and iii tumor patients. the results of the classification are summarized in table  <dig>  the classification result of the first naïve bayes approach shown in figure  <dig> indicates that sera of common type and atypical meningiomas can be clearly differentiated from sera of healthy individuals whereas who grade iii sera cannot be equally well separated from normal sera. this finding is reflected in the high auc values for the detection of who i and ii sera and the relatively small auc value for the detection of whoiii sera. applying unpaired two-sample t-tests, we found that the differences of the classification results were statistically significant in each case .

number of antigens required for classification
next, we computed the minimal number of antigens required for an optimal classification of low-grade meningiomas using the subset selection method described in 'materials'. twelve antigens only yielded the best separation between common type meningiomas and normal sera with a specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , and an accuracy of  <dig> % . the corresponding auc value was  <dig>  . notably, not all of these  <dig> antigens are meningioma-specific. one classification result is shown exemplarily in figure  <dig>  the specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and auc value as a function of the number of antigens are provided in figure  <dig>  this result indicates that the identification of low-grade meningiomas with high specificity and sensitivity requires only a subset of all antigens. for comparison, we also carried out the same subset selection procedure for who grade ii and iii sera. an optimal classification of who grade ii meningioma sera from normal sera requires  <dig> antigens resulting in a specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , an accuracy of  <dig> % , and an auc of  <dig>  . for who grade iii,  <dig> antigens are necessary to perform an optimal classification, yielding a specificity of  <dig> % , a sensitivity of  <dig> % , an accuracy of  <dig> % , and an auc of  <dig>  . the classification results are summarized in table  <dig> 

performing the classification of normal sera versus meningioma sera by using just the  <dig> specific antigens reduced the accuracy and auc value significantly to 80% and  <dig>  . therefore, integration of the non-specific antigens that contribute additional information makes the classification significantly more accurate and reliable.

discussion
the availability of a set of immunogenic antigens is central to the idea of using the reactivity pattern to gain insight into the molecular pathology of tumor development. many antigens formerly considered as tumor specific antigens also show reactivity with normal sera if the number of screened normal sera is increased. scanlan and co-workers propose that approximately 60% of cancer antigens react with normal sera  <cit> . likewise, the definition of tumor antigens based on the expression pattern is less clear than originally proposed. a ubiquitous expression is reported for more than 10% of cancer testis antigens that should by definition be expressed in testis and cancer only  <cit> . our results are consistent with this data in that they also show a decreasing number of specific antigens with increasing number of normal sera. a lack of tumor-specific antigens, i.e. antigens that do not react with normal sera, is generally thought to impair the development of antigens sets useful for tumor analysis. however, our study shows for the first time that the observed decrease of the number of specific antigens with increasing number of screened normal sera poses no problem. in fact, including non-specific antigens in the marker set improved the accuracy and reliability of the serum based approach significantly.

we have shown that our diagnosis works especially well on low-grade  meningioma sera. that observation can be explained by the fact that the sera of lower-grade meningiomas show on average an increased immune response compared to who grade iii sera. on averaged,  <dig>  of the  <dig> antigens show reactivity with who grade i sera,  <dig>  with who grade ii sera, and  <dig>  with who grade ii sera. in comparison, normal sera show an averaged reactivity of only  <dig>  antigens per serum. the decrease of seroreactivity in who grade iii tumors may be a result of antigen loss as part of a tumor escape mechanism  <cit> .

the knowledge of the nature of the antigens is of great value for a serum-based analysis of human tumors. a recent study shows a relatively high number of sequences that do not represent known proteins  <cit> . these sequences are thought to mimic immunogenic antigens . without having high homology to known proteins, mimotopes are of no use to provide insight into tumor development. in our study,  <dig> of the  <dig> marker sequences  are homologous to known proteins as shown in table  <dig> 

to further evaluate our set of meningioma-associated antigens, we computed the overlap of the  <dig> meningioma-associated antigens with the antigen sets that were reported for ovarian and prostate cancer types  <cit> . we found no overlap with any of these antigen sets. an analysis using pubmed showed that only six meningioma-associated antigens  were immunogenic in other human cancers. these results indicate that our set of meningioma-associated antigens very likely classifies only sera of meningioma patients as meningioma sera.

as addressed above, experimental approaches always bear the possibility of misclassifications. in our study, we misclassified a small number of normal sera as meningioma sera . this leaves the question whether a positive prediction of a normal serum is a classification error or represents a not detected meningioma patient. according to our protocol, all normal sera were randomized prior to the experiments. this protocol excluded the possibility to examine donors of control blood sera for a potential tumor. it cannot be ruled out that our test identified a tumor patient that has so far gone unnoticed. while the annual incidence of meningioma patients that come to attention in the clinic is approximately  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> , post mortem studies suggest a true incidental asymptomatic rate of approximately  <dig> %  <cit> . the comparatively high prevalence results in an excellent negative predictive value of  <dig>  and an acceptable positive predictive value of  <dig> .

mimm neither depends on a single marker nor represents a proteomics approach like the serum based diagnosis of ovarian cancer that triggered a discussion over the general validity of any diagnostic test based on proteomics  <cit> . unlike many proteomics approaches, mimm utilizes a small set of proteins only. it is a conservative approach in that any additional serum analysis helps to improve the set of antigens that best marks out a cancer patient. mimm is an open system that is designed to constantly improve over time. once a critical group of antigens is assembled for a given cancer type, any investigator can add, or if necessary remove, antigens to optimize the power of an antigen set for the characterization of patients with a specific tumor. in addition, any new serum that is analyzed with the antigen set improves the predictive value of each antigen of the set. these results indicate that our approach appears to be well suited to analyse the majority of meningioma patients and to do so specifically efficient for patients with low-grade meningiomas. provided these results can be extended to other tumor types, mimm represents a highly promising approach to analyse tumors that are still in its early stages of development.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a minimally invasive diagnostic framework based on the classification of tumor antigen patterns in blood sera using statistical learning techniques. we validated our approach on meningioma tumors finding that it is especially suited to detect tumors that are still in their early stages of development. to further validate and improve the presented approach, independent training and test set of appropriate size will be generated. since our long term goal is a diagnostic framework for a broad range of human tumors we will test mimm on several other tumor types. our diagnostic tool may offer the possibility to screen members of risk groups at regular intervals such that tumors can be diagnosed immediately after their genesis. it can be expected that the early detection will finally result in a higher cure- and lower morbidity-rate  <cit> .
