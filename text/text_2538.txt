BACKGROUND
aux/iaas are auxin response genes that code for nuclear localized proteins  <cit> . aux/iaa proteins generally have four characteristic domains; an n-terminal repression domain, an adjacent domain involved in protein stability, and two c-terminal domains , iii and iv, through which aux/iaa proteins form homo- and heterodimers with aux/iaa or arf proteins  <cit> . most arf proteins contain an n-terminal b3-like dna binding domain that includes an arf family-specific domain, a variable middle region that confers activator or repressor activity, and domains iii and iv that are also found in aux/iaa  <cit> . arf proteins are capable, irrespective of auxin status, of binding to auxin responsive cis-elements  present upstream to the coding sequence of auxin responsive genes  <cit> . aux/iaa proteins bind to the dna-bound arf partner proteins via domains iii and iv and repress arf activity. in the auxin activated status, aux/iaa proteins are ubiquitinated via interactions with the auxin-modified scftir1complex and subsequently degraded by 26s proteasome action  <cit> . while some arfs possess a characteristic glutamine -rich middle region which confers an activator activity, arfs with a proline, serine and threonine-rich middle region are found to be associated with repressor activity  <cit> . the complexity of auxin regulatory activity is due in part to the large sizes of the arf and aux/iaa gene families, as well as variations in activation or repression activity among arfs, heterodimerization affinities, expression patterns, and auxin-mediated transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.

despite the knowledge that aux/iaas and arfs influence apical dominance, vascular development, tropic movements, root growth, tissue and organ patterning, and flower and fruit development  <cit> , many questions still linger. for example, these gene families remain largely uncharacterized in forest tree species and the degree of conservation of gene families between annual and perennial woody plants is unknown. furthermore, the mechanisms of aux/iaa and arf interaction and regulation are not completely understood and much remains to be learned about their roles in the contexts of a cell and the whole organism. identification of aux/iaa and arf gene families from distinct model plants is a necessary step in formulating better hypotheses related to physiological and developmental processes. the recent sequencing of the populus genome has provided an additional reference genome for testing inferences on auxin signal transduction events obtained previously through functional genomic studies of arabidopsis.

the present paper summarizes findings from bioinformatics-based comparative genomic studies to identify the total number of aux/iaa and arf genes in populus, to predict the protein domain architectures, and to assess the extent of conservation and divergence between populus, arabidopsis and rice gene families. targeted rt-pcr and whole genome microarray analyses, and est database surveys were also undertaken to explore differential expression of closely grouping co-orthologs. furthermore, we have reflected on the possible implications of differential patterns of retention, loss, and expansion of duplicated homeologous genes.

RESULTS
identification and sequence analysis of populus aux/iaa genes
the populus genome has  <dig> predicted aux/iaa genes  compared to  <dig> genes in the arabidopsis genome   <cit>  and to  <dig> genes in the rice genome   <cit> . in silico mapping of the gene loci showed that poptriaa genes are present on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes .

any analysis of populus gene family evolution must take into account the most significant event in the recent evolution of the genus; a genome-wide duplication event that occurred approximately  <dig> mya and which is still detectable over approximately 92% of the genome  <cit> . based on the age estimates of duplicate genes and homology-microsynteny analysis ,  <dig> poptriaa genes pairs  are represented within segmental duplication regions associated with the recent salicoid duplication event. it is intriguing that  <dig> pairs of tandem duplicates are represented as 'ancient tandem genes' within more recent whole genome or segmental duplicate clusters. these  <dig> poptriaa genes  are represented in  <dig> distinct tandem duplicate gene clusters, with  <dig> clusters containing two tandem genes and  <dig> cluster containing  <dig> tandem genes .

it is possible that some of the apparently closely-related genes are in fact alleles from unassembled haplotypes, which are potential artifacts from shotgun assembly of this highly heterozygous genome. for example, poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  group closely with their tandem duplicates, poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig> , and poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  genes are located on a presently unassembled scaffold . however, the apparent co-orthologs are divergent at the amino acid level as well as in the flanking gene order and identity in the syntenic blocks, which argue against the classification of the scaffold as a haplotype.

further analyses of conserved domains and multiple sequence alignments of predicted proteins showed that some populus genes contain modifications in the conserved domain architecture . based on meme-mast protein motif analysis, domain i was found to be missing in poptriaa <dig> , poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  and also in the arabidopsis ortholog, atiaa <dig>  similarly, domains i and ii appear to be missing in poptriaa <dig> , poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig> as well as atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig>  multiple sequence alignment shows that the "idlglslrt" sequence reported as domain i motif in atiaa <dig>   <cit>  is conserved with atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig>  in which the consensus sequence of the reported domain i is "telxlxlpg"  <cit> .

domain ii enables the scftir1-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation of aux/iaa  <cit> . rapid basal degradation rate and auxin responsiveness of aux/iaa proteins are found to be associated with alterations in the highly conserved domain ii motif, 'vgwppi/v'  <cit>  and the 'kr' motif between domains i and ii  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis show that mutations in the vgwppv motif render the repressor protein stable  <cit> . multiple sequence alignments of full-length amino acid sequences revealed deviations in both the 'vgwppi/v' and 'kr' motif sequences in poptriaa <dig> , poptriaa <dig> , poptriaa  <dig> , poptriaa  <dig> , poptriaa  <dig> , poptriaa  <dig> and atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig>  deviations in the conserved 'kr' motif alone were observed in poptriaa <dig> , poptriaa <dig>  and atiaa <dig> sequences. however, poptriaa <dig>  was found to be unique in that it contains a tandem duplication of the domain ii region . this unique feature has not been detected in aux/iaa genes reported from any other genera including arabidopsis, oryza, vitis, nicotiana and coffea, but was found in genbank ests derived from p. trichocarpa, p. deltoides, p. tremuloides, p. tremula × tremuloides  <cit> , p. alba × tremula, p. trichocarpa × deltoides and p. fremontii × angustifolia, suggesting that this is a populus-specific acquisition.

comparative analysis of populus and arabidopsis aux/iaa gene families
phylogenetic reconstruction at the molecular level using all available and predicted populus, arabidopsis and rice aux/iaa amino acid sequences shows that four groups of poptriaas  have expanded to contain three or more members each . three atiaas did not have a representative sequence ortholog in populus, indicating acquisition or perpetuation of distinct aux/iaas unique to arabidopsis and its relatively recent ancestors.

there are four homologs of atiaa <dig>  poptriaa <dig> – <dig> , predicted in the populus genome. phylogenetic groupings suggest absence of atiaa <dig> orthologs from rice. poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  are likely co-orthologs of an ancestral gene lost in arabidopsis. these co-orthologs have intact conserved domains and est evidence supporting their functionality . based on est data, poptriaa <dig>  appears to express during wood formation , whereas poptriaa <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to express in young leaves . a poptriaa <dig> -like est was previously reported from hybrid aspen to be expressed in the context of wood formation and a poptriaa <dig> -like est was shown to be expressed in dividing and expanding cells  <cit> . these findings are partially supported by our whole genome microarray data, which showed that poptriaa <dig>  was expressed in xylem, phloem, cortex, root and seed .

however, there was no array evidence to support expression of poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  in young leaf tissues, though poptriaa <dig>  was expressed at the stem apex, in apical vegetative buds, newly set reproductive buds of both genders, and in older leaves.

two aux/iaa proteins, iaa26/pap <dig>  and iaa <dig> are known to interact with phytochrome a   <cit>  and tmv replicase  <cit> . populus has three iaa27-like aux/iaa genes. est and microarray data suggest expression in shoot meristem, floral buds and dormant and active cambia . possible affinity for interaction with phya protein suggests a role for poptriaa <dig> in external-stimuli-dependent cambium activation or growth status. poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  genes cluster closely with atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig> and are expressed in shoot meristem, young and senescing leaves, male catkins, and floral buds. rt-pcr survey of poptriaa <dig>  and poptriaa <dig>  genes shows highest expression in young leaves. since atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig> proteins display binding affinity towards phya, it is likely that these populus sequence orthologs are also involved in mediating the photoregulation of various tree developmental processes.

poptriaa <dig> – <dig>  represent a six-member poptriaa <dig> subgroup that groups closely with atiaa1– <dig>  this subgroup provides striking evidence for functional divergence following selective retention of duplicated genes. while the arabidopsis shy <dig> mutant, carrying a gain-of-function mutation in atiaa <dig>  has upcurled leaves, slower gravitropic response, shorter hypocotyls and fewer lateral roots  <cit> , a functional role for atiaa <dig> is yet to be assigned. gene-specific real-time rt-pcr showed that genes in the poptriaa <dig> subgroup display differential expression between leaf, stem and root tissues . poptriaa <dig>  was found to have a higher expression level by several fold in stem than in roots. in an earlier study of aspen aux/iaa genes, the poptriaa <dig> -like gene had highest expression in developing xylem  <cit> , which is also supported by our microarray results . est data suggest that poptriaa <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to be preferentially expressed in the cambial zone and during wood formation , and the microarray data suggest that these genes are also strongly expressed in newly germinated seedlings. poptriaa <dig> -like ests are found in libraries of dormant buds and senescing leaves. poptriaa <dig>  has a distinct expression pattern compared to other poptriaa <dig> genes, with detectable ests in male and female catkins, and highest expression in floral buds as determined by the microarray .

identification and sequence analysis of populus arf genes
a total of  <dig> predicted arf genes  were found in the populus genome, compared to  <dig> genes reported from the arabidopsis genome   <cit>  and to  <dig> genes reported from the rice genome   <cit> . in silico mapping of gene loci showed poptrarf genes are present on all chromosomes except vii, xiii, xvii and xix . eleven out of  <dig> genes lie within unassembled scaffolds. conserved domain evaluations showed that four gene models  appear to lack one or more domains that are otherwise conserved in their closest sequence ortholog .

sixteen poptrarf gene pairs  are estimated to be represented in chromosomal segmental duplications arising out of the salicoid whole genome duplication event. two genes, poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig> ,  are represented as one tandem duplication pair. the arabidopsis genome contains a group of seven tandemly duplicated arf genes that thus far have not been observed in other plant species including populus and rice.

comparative analysis of populus and arabidopsis arf gene families
phylogenetic analysis using known and predicted populus, arabidopsis and rice arf protein sequences shows distinct gene family histories even between the two dicots . the ratio of activator arfs  in arabidopsis and populus is 1: <dig>  whereas the ratio of repressor and other arfs is 1: <dig> , indicating a two-fold enrichment of activator arfs during populus evolution.

a pair of populus genes, poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf  <dig> , was found to group closely with three osarf genes but had no obvious arabidopsis orthologs. the loss-of-function arf <dig> mutant displays altered leaf expansion, lateral root formation  <cit>  and hypocotyl phototropism  <cit>  in arabidopsis. poptrarf <dig>  has est support from a tension wood library , and microarray data indicated that poptrarf <dig>  has higher expression in xylem tissue . it is possible that analogous to atarf7's role in auxin dependent differential growth in aerial plant form  <cit> , poptrarf <dig>  may be involved in differential growth in woody stems in response to tension stress.

at least three different singleton arabidopsisarf genes  were found to cluster with four or more populus genes each. poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig>  are likely co-orthologs of an ancestral gene lost in arabidopsis. atarf  <dig> and its populus co-orthologs have q-rich middle regions. potato arf <dig>  which is similar to atarf <dig>  is reported to be involved in meristem activation  <cit> . sprouting buds, apical meristem and leaf tips were reported to have the highest arf <dig> transcript levels. while poptrarf <dig>  has est support from cambial zone and tension wood tissue libraries, poptrarf <dig> , has expression support from a dormant bud library and poptrarf <dig>  has est support from floral bud libraries. furthermore, our microarray experiments indicated that the five members of the poptrarf <dig> subgroup showed differential patterns of expression. poptrarf <dig>  and  <dig>  were expressed at low levels, with peaks in mature leaves and phloem-cortex samples. in contrast, poptrarf <dig>  and  <dig>  were strongly expressed across most tissue types, with particularly strong expression in xylem, phloem, and vegetative and reproductive meristems. finally, poptrarf <dig>  was not significantly expressed in any of the tissues tested . interestingly, atarf <dig> and  <dig>  are associated with floral development in arabidopsis  <cit> . they also display reduced stature, possibly due to reduced apical meristem activity. though further experimental validation is required, preliminary information suggests that this subgroup has functional roles in controlling meristematic activity in distinct tissues and developmental stages.

atarf <dig> negatively regulates differential growth in arabidopsis hypocotyls  <cit> . atarf <dig> mutants are reported to have defective floral structures  <cit> . t-dna insertion mutants of atarf <dig> have larger rosette leaves and reduced number and size of other aerial organs including inflorescences  <cit> . atarf <dig> t-dna insertion mutants also exhibit extra cell division and expansion in seeds and other vegetative and floral organs <cit> . populus has four putative atarf <dig> orthologs . poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig>  are likely co-orthologs of an ancestral gene lost in arabidopsis. based on microarray and est support, poptrarf <dig>  and  <dig>  appear to express almost ubiquitously, with particularly strong expression in xylem and phloem. poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig>  were expressed in vegetative and floral buds, as well as in the cambial  zone. tissue distribution of populus ests and array results suggest that these sequence orthologs may possess similar functional contexts in populus and arabidopsis.

characterization of the ettin  mutant revealed that atarf <dig> is involved in floral meristem, gynoecium, stamen and perianth patterning  <cit> . populus has three arf3-like genes out of which, poptrarf <dig>  and  <dig>  had some est and microarray expression support from vegetative and reproductive buds, but surprisingly these genes were most strongly expressed in xylem and phloem. poptrarf <dig>  was not included on the microarray because the gene model was artificially truncated in the initial annotation.

monopteros , a loss-of-function atarf <dig> mutant, has a severely malformed embryonic axis and vascular system, and defective inflorescences where lateral flowers are completely lacking or reduced in number  <cit> . populus has two putative orthologs of atarf <dig>  poptrarf <dig>  and  <dig> , and rt-pcr and microarray results indicate slightly higher expression in roots compared to stem and leaves . populus est and microarray data show that poptrarf <dig>  is highly expressed in floral buds. it remains to be determined if these co-orthologs could be considered as sub-functionalized with respect to atarf <dig>  or if they play additional roles in tree development.

evolution, divergence and regulation of aux/iaa and arf gene families
genome-wide duplications followed by a series of reciprocal tandem terminal fusions have resulted in a dramatic reorganization of the duplicated genome segments in populus. ensuing gene loss and expansion events have contributed toward divergence in gene family structures between the dicots, arabidopsis and populus  <cit> . moreover, the modes of expansion, either through tandem or segmental duplication, differ between members of each gene family.

phylogenetic analysis revealed a few subgroups such as iaa <dig> and arf <dig> that contained sequence representatives in populus and arabidopsis but not in rice indicating that these subgroups were acquired or differentially retained in dicots post-divergence from monocots.

contrary to the arf gene family, aux/iaa gene family was observed to have expanded largely due to segmental duplications in arabidopsis  <cit> . segmental duplications have also contributed to expansion of both these gene families in rice  <cit> . our study indicates that poptriaa as well as poptrarf genes have been largely retained at a higher than average rate following the salicoid genome-wide duplication and rearrangement events. on a genome-wide scale, approximately  <dig>  of the  <dig>   predicted genes are retained in duplicated pairs resulting from the salicoid duplication event  <cit> . the retention rates for poptriaa and poptrarf families are 80% and 82% respectively. this is in line with the expectation that genes involved in transcription regulation and signal transduction are preferentially retained following duplication  <cit> . the low proportion of retained tandem duplicates  in the poptrarf gene family compared to the poptriaa family is potentially due to constraints associated with dimer stoichiometry maintenance for arf transcription factor activity as tandem clusters do exist for other populus gene families  <cit> . even though 43% of poptriaa genes are represented in tandem clusters of two to three genes each, nearly 86% of these tandem clusters have likely expanded and been retained following chromosome-level segmental duplication or whole-genome duplication events. these observations suggest that poptriaa and poptrarf transcription factor families consist of genes originating primarily from high segmental  and secondarily from low tandem  duplication events. sub-functionalization, neo-functionalization and non-functionalization events associated with duplicate transcription factor genes carry a greater weight for functional ramifications such as the ability to differentially regulate auxin signal transduction pathways. it could be speculated, based primarily on our understanding of the functional role of the nearest arabidopsis ortholog  <cit> , that the presence of multiple arf <dig> co-orthologs in the populus genome could reflect the greater need for temporal control on cell division and expansion in the context of flowering, senescence and abscission in populus, a perennial deciduous tree that exhibits seasonal dynamics and transitioning between juvenile to mature to reproductive stages across a time-span of years as opposed to days as in the annual arabidopsis. considering the complexity of arf- and aux/iaa- mediated regulation, the reasons for and implications of diversification will require further understanding using evolutionary systems biology studies  <cit> .

closely-related arfs that represent pairs of sister loci have been found to have strong double-mutant phenotypes and overlapping expression domains  <cit> . furthermore, interaction affinities were found to be stronger among intra-group  members when compared to inter-group members  <cit> . moreover, single and double mutants resulting from atiaa <dig> gain-of-function and arf <dig> loss-of-function mutants have similar mutant phenotypes. it is proposed that arf <dig> may act in a positive and iaa <dig> in negative regulatory way to control embryogenesis and root meristem development in an auxin-dependent manner  <cit> . rt-pcr results show that poptrarf <dig> and poptriaa <dig> genes display contrasting expression patterns in roots . the high expression of poptrarf <dig> in roots and low expression of poptriaa <dig> suggests that they may co-regulate root development in populus in an auxin dependent manner. the potential number of heterotypic interactions between populus arfs and aux/iaas are likely several times greater than the number of members in these two large gene families. this may contribute to higher-order auxin signal and response mechanisms needed by perennial plants to achieve greater developmental plasticity.

the auxin response mechanism has recently been shown to be also regulated through small noncoding rna species; microrna  and trans-acting short-interfering rna . atarf  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are known to be regulated by mir <dig>  a mirna group that is highly conserved across the plant kingdom  <cit>  and atarf <dig> and atarf <dig> have shown to be regulated by mir <dig>  <cit> . both mir <dig> and mir <dig> families are predicted to be two-fold overrepresented in the populus genome when compared to arabidopsis  <cit> . target sequences for mir <dig> have been detected in poptrarf <dig> - <dig> , poptrarf <dig> – <dig>  and poptrarf <dig> – <dig>  and mir <dig> targets have been found in poptrarf <dig> – <dig>  and poptrarf <dig> – <dig> .

tas <dig> ta-sirna has been shown to mediate post-transcriptional regulation of arf <dig> and arf <dig> gene expression  <cit>  and to play a key role in juvenile to adult phase transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . the ta-sirna target site sequences were reported to be conserved among atarf <dig>  atarf <dig> and atarf <dig> and related rice and wheat sequences  <cit> . homologous conserved sites were found to occur once in poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig>  and twice in poptrarf <dig> , poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig> genes. genbank database searches showed that grape, tobacco, medicago and tomato arf3-like sequences also carry two conserved ta-sirna target sites. the individual poptrarf co-orthologs as well as the different genes represented in the mir and tasir groups provide myriad opportunities for complex regulatory interactions of auxin-related transcription in populus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified the suites of aux/iaa and arf genes in the populus genome and revealed their gene family structures. comparative genomics with arabidopsis and rice suggested that the two gene families have a common origin, including conservation of activator groups in arf gene families of all three genomes, but have experienced separate evolutionary histories, diverging in important ways, including the lack of large clusters of tandemly duplicated atarf genes from populus and rice, lack of poptrarf <dig>  and poptrarf <dig>  orthologs in arabidopsis and substantial expansion of certain poptriaa and poptrarf subgroups through large-scale segmental duplications. overall, the gene family structures of populus and arabidopsis displayed a greater degree of conservation with each other than in comparison with the monocot plant, rice.

the populus genome sequence and the findings reported here provide new opportunities to facilitate postulation and exploration of hypotheses linking auxin response regulatory genes to conserved core plant processes, as well as perennial plant features such as wood development, long-distance nutrient and water movement, seasonal dynamics, and disease resistance. targeted reverse genetics studies, high-resolution spatiotemporal expression surveys as well as investigations of in vivo homo- and hetero-dimerization affinities of the various aux/iaa and arf gene family members among taxa will need to be carried out to understand how the molecular functions of these genes translate into a diverse suite of auxin-mediated effects at the whole-plant level. further studies on basic aspects of the functional contexts of aux/iaa and arf proteins will open opportunities for applications in agricultural, forestry, environmental and energy sectors. one such application includes ongoing functional genomics studies to investigate the roles of poptriaa and poptrarf genes in carbon allocation and carbon sequestration.
