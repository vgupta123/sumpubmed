BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium responsible for c. difficile infection  in humans  <cit> , a serious and increasingly problematic disease. a remarkable change in the epidemiology of cdi has been encountered over the past  <dig> years, with increasing incidence, mortality and relapse rates in humans  <cit> . additionally, while classically a hospital-associated pathogen predominantly affecting elderly individuals, there are increasing reports of community-associated cdi, including disease in younger individuals and people with few or no traditional risk factors  <cit> .

the source of infection for community-associated cases of cdi remains uncertain, however foodborne infection has been suggested  <cit> . indeed, several studies have recovered spores of c. difficile from food products including retail meat  <cit> , yet the source of contamination for food products has not been identified. contamination of carcasses during slaughter and processing is most likely  <cit> , but the presence of dormant spores of the bacterium in the muscle tissues of food animals should also be considered  <cit> .

while currently unproven, concerns about zoonotic and foodborne transmission of cdi are reasonable considering reports of isolation of c. difficile from animals. concern has been heightened by the apparent increase in cdi in humans caused by the c. difficile ribotype  <dig>  <cit> , a strain that has been associated with community-associated infection  <cit>  since this is the dominant c. difficile strain among food animals  <cit>  and has also been recovered from meat products  <cit> .

high prevalences of c. difficile shedding have been reported in food animals, yet most studies have involved young animals well before the time of slaughter. studies of animals performed nearer to the time of slaughter are likely more relevant for assessment of the potential for foodborne exposure, yet limited epidemiological investigations have been performed in feedlot cattle  <cit> .

the objectives of this study were to evaluate the shedding of c. difficile by adult feedlot cattle upon arrival and after acclimation to the feedlot diet and environment, and to characterize the recovered isolates. in addition, the potential association between the use of antimicrobial drugs and shedding of the bacterium was also investigated.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> cattle were sampled from  <dig> feedlots, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cattle per feedlot . adjusting for lack of independence in pens, c. difficile was isolated overall from  <dig> % of  <dig>  animals at the time of feedlot arrival in  <dig> unique pens and from  <dig> % of  <dig>  cattle at mid-feeding period in  <dig> unique pens. no individuals were positive at both sampling times.

results of the regression analysis using generalized estimating equation , accounting for the date of sampling during the feeding period , 62- <dig> dof, or > 71dof) and for the effects of repeated sampling are presented in table  <dig>  there was no statistically detectable difference in the likelihood of recovery of c. difficile based on dof .

* controlling for lack of independence sampling

sixty-four individuals were treated with parenteral antimicrobials during the study period including beta-lactams , macrolides , phenicols , quinolones , sulfonamides  and tetracyclines . the sum of the animal defined daily dose , which quantifies the total amount of antimicrobials administered for each period and for the total risk period were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for each of the drug classes, respectively. tetracycline was the only in-feed antimicrobial used and was given to all individuals, with a summed add of  <dig> . as shown in table  <dig>  there was no significant association between the use of tetracycline and the prevalence of c. difficile in these animals . results for models regarding the remaining antimicrobials are not shown, as the univariable logistic regression models did not converge.

one isolate could not be recovered after storage and therefore, molecular analysis was performed on the remaining  <dig> isolates. all the isolates recovered were classified as ribotype  <dig> and were positive for the toxin producing genes tcda, tcdb and cdta. all isolates were indistinguishable on pfge and classified as north american pulsotype  <dig>  . as expected, sequencing of the tcdc gene identified a  <dig> bp deletion and c184t upstream truncating mutation, consistent with the tcdc-a genotype according to curry et al.  <cit> .

discussion
the prevalence of feedlot cattle shedding c. difficile was low at both sampling times. there is a limited number of studies concerning the epidemiology of c. difficile in the bovine species and the data available in the literature are largely restricted to calves  <cit> . the low shedding prevalence of c. difficile in cattle arriving at feedlots reported here is in agreement with the prevalence reported by indra et al.  <cit>  in cows  and slightly higher than the one reported by rodriguez-palacios et al.  <cit>  in feedlot cattle at harvest age . however, our results indicate a lower shedding prevalence than the one found by rodriguez-palacios et al.  <cit>  whom isolated the bacterium from  <dig> % of animals arriving to feedlot. the reasons for this difference cannot be explained, however stressing from shipping and different management conditions prior to arrival such as hygiene, population, stocking density, animal mixing and antimicrobial administration should be considered, along with potential geographic variation and differences in methodology.

a high prevalence of c. difficile shedding has been reported in young calves. the bacterium was recovered from  <dig> % of healthy calves in one study  <cit>  and from  <dig> % in another  <cit> , but it can be as high as 51% in veal calves  <cit> . in addition, c. difficile has been detected by pcr in feces of  <dig> % of calves submitted for post-mortem examination  <cit> . the lower prevalence in this and the above-cited studies of older animals is perhaps not surprising given increasing evidence of a strong effect of age on c. difficile shedding prevalence, something that has been noted in swine  <cit>  and horses,  <cit> , as well as humans  <cit> . costa et al.  <cit>  also observed a significant decrease in shedding prevalence  as veal calves became older, which is in agreement with hoffer et al.  <cit> , who isolated c. difficile from only one out of  <dig> veal calves sampled at slaughter. the reasons for a higher shedding prevalence in young individuals are uncertain but competition from a more adapted intestinal microflora in older animals may make colonization more difficult. in addition, stress from birth adaptation, a na√Øve immune response, the type of feeding and the different management systems could also explain the increased prevalence in younger animals.

the potential for antimicrobial drugs to disrupt the normal intestinal microflora leading to c. difficile overgrowth has been shown in other species, including humans  <cit>  and horses  <cit> . therefore, in order to further investigate the effect of c. difficile shedding by animals from feedlot, antimicrobial exposure of cattle was investigated. antimicrobial exposure, particularly tetracyclines, was common however no influence on c. difficile shedding was identified. the lack of an identifiable association between the use of antimicrobials and shedding of c. difficile reported here agrees with the findings of rodriguez-palacios et al.  <cit> .

ribotype  <dig>  the only strain found here, can cause cdi in humans  <cit>  and has been increasingly associated with community-associated cdi  <cit> . a study of human and animal ribotype  <dig> isolates using highly discriminatory multilocus variable number tandem repeat analyses indicated they were closely related, suggesting that the bacterium may be transmitted between humans and animals  <cit> . the predominance of this strain was not particularly surprising since it is typically associated with food animals, has been found in various studies of pigs and cattle and it is the most commonly reported strain in pigs in canada  <cit> . in addition, the strain has been prevalent  among isolates recovered from some retail beef samples  <cit> . another interesting aspect was the finding that no cattle were positive at both sampling times. this suggests that persistent carriers are not common, and that c. difficile may be transiently shed and circulated throughout animal populations. inconsistent or transient shedding has also been reported in dogs  <cit>  and horses  <cit> . further studies involving more frequent sampling would help elucidate the on-farm cycling of c. difficile.

the predominance of clones classified as ribotype 078/nap <dig> recovered from beef cattle reported here  reinforces the results of other studies in the bovine species  <cit> . however, other researchers found that only  <dig> out of  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  <cit>  isolates recovered from cattle were ribotype  <dig>  in addition, it was interesting that other strains, including 027/nap iii, found in retail beef  <cit>  were not isolated in the present study.

the prevalence of shedding of c. difficile ribotype  <dig> by feedlot cattle reported here is an important information for a better understanding of c. difficile epidemiology in adult beef cattle. the low prevalence upon feedlot arrival and later in the feeding period must be considered when interpreting food contamination and foodborne risks. the lack of an effect of antimicrobials exposure was interesting and while a study such as this cannot completely discount a role of antimicrobials in the epidemiology of c. difficile in cattle, it is clearly not a major determinant, at least on these farms.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the prevalence of c. difficile in adult cattle was low at arrival and at mid-feeding period from feedlots. no association was found between exposure to antimicrobial drugs or between days on feed and the prevalence of c. difficile in this collection of samples. ribotype 078/nap <dig> was the only strain present among all isolates recovered. it is apparent that c difficile is carried in the intestinal tracts of a small percentage of beef cattle going to slaughter, but its public health significance requires further study.
