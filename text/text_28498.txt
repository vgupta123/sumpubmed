BACKGROUND
recent molecular studies into the microbial diversity of the human intestine reveal a much greater diversity than previously recognized and very little is currently known of the contribution of individual groups to the human organism  <cit> . one numerically dominant group of microbes, the bifidobacteria, is often suggested to be associated with good intestinal health given their overriding dominance in the feces of breast fed infants  <cit> . this phenomenon led to their discovery in  <dig> by the pediatrician henri tissier and his subsequent use of these bacteria for the treatment of infantile diarrhea  <cit> . the proposed beneficial effect of bifidobacteria is further supported by the decrease of these bacteria in geriatric individuals and the concomitant increase of other microbial groups, most notably clostridia and e. coli  <cit> . this has led to the growing worldwide interest of including bifidobacteria in foods specifically for their potential intestinal health benefits  <cit> . however, clinical feeding studies with bifidobacteria show that while the strains can be detected in subject's feces during feeding trials, they are rapidly lost upon cessation of the studies pointing to a possible loss of competitive fitness of the strains for competition within the human intestinal environment  <cit> . this may be due to attenuation of the strains, as the fermentation environment is very different to the buffered and anaerobic environment of the human colon.

to further the understanding of genetic attenuation that may occur in bifidobacteria, the complete genomic sequence of a numerically dominant human intestinal isolate of bifidobacterium longum, that was grown for less than  <dig> generations in laboratory media, was deciphered. this was compared to an available genome sequence of a culture collection strain, b. longum ncc <dig>  <cit>  and analysis of the functional attributes of its unique sequences have contributed to a better understanding of attenuation that can occur in these bacteria in a fermentation environment.

RESULTS
genomic sequencing of a minimally cultured b. longum strain
the power of comparative genomics can provide insights into features that are important for a species to survive and compete in its habitat. the genome sequence of the culture collection strain, b. longum ncc <dig>  <cit> , is available and the ability to compare this genome with one from a strain that was deliberately minimally cultured in vitro may provide new insights to features that may be important for this prominent species from the human large gut. newly isolated and minimally cultured b. longum strains were characterized and strain djo10a was selected based on its prominent ability to bacteriostatically inhibit other bacteria through the production of siderophores  <cit> , a characteristic that appeared attenuated in all culture collection and commercial bifidobacteria analyzed. it was therefore selected for genomic sequencing as an isolate that likely had minimal attenuation from its origin in the intestine. the complete genome sequence of this strain was deciphered and consisted of one circular chromosome  and two cryptic plasmids, pdojh10l and pdojh10s that were described previously  <cit> .

general characteristics of the b. longum djo10a genome
the chromosome of b. longum djo10a contained  <dig> , <dig> bp, with  <dig> % g+c content and  <dig>  encoded genes containing four rrna operons,  <dig> trnas,  <dig> insertion sequence  families as well as one prophage . its genomic characteristics were analogous to strain ncc <dig>  except it contained an extra trna_ser: gct encoded on its prophage  <cit> . codon usage analysis showed that this trna is the most frequently used trna_ser in the prophage, while it is not the most used trna_ser for the b. longum djo10a genome , pointing to an evolutionary selective pressure for its presence on the prophage. while both genomes contained trna's for every amino acid, the corresponding genes for aminoacyl-trna synthetases for both asparagine and glutamine are missing, suggesting a reliance on alternative pathways for translation with these amino acids, similar to many other bacteria  <cit> . both these alternative pathways involve gatabc, which is present in both genomes as well as gltx and asps involved in the glutamine and asparagine alternative translation pathways respectively, substantiating this proposed translation route. interestingly, the b. longum genome contains novel mobile integrase cassettes  consisting of three different contiguous integrases flanked by an inverted repeat and a palindrome structure sandwiched by two is3-type is elements . analysis of the genome of b. longum ncc <dig> revealed three analogous mic elements, located in a non-linear fashion relative to strain djo10a indicating these elements are indeed mobile . interestingly, analysis of the genome sequences of another bifidobacterium species, b. adolescentis , as well as other intestinal bacteria, bacteroides , lactobacillus , and e. coli , did not reveal mic elements, suggesting these structures may be unique to a subset of closely related bifidobacteria.

a, refers to unique regions that encode functional or hypothetical genes in dna regions >  <dig> kb, b, includes fragmented elements

organization of the origin and terminus of replication
an oric and terc were found in identical locations in the genome of strain djo10a and the updated genome sequence of strain ncc <dig> . these regions are extremely highly conserved in both genomes  and consist of three oric clusters and a terc, which is consistent with the predicted replication regions from other bacterial genomes  <cit> . however, the location of the observed oric region in both genomes is slightly different from the predicted location based on genome asymmetry, a feature that has previously been seen in the helicobacter pylori  <dig> genome  <cit> . as well as the multiple oric clusters, there are  <dig> different types of dnaa boxes, consistent with the majority of sequenced genomes and are proposed to be involved in controlling initiation of chromosome replication  <cit> .

restriction and modification  systems
the protective role that r-m systems impart on bacteria has been compared to the immune system of higher organisms  <cit> . the presence of these systems in numerous bacteria demonstrates their important role for bacterial survival in nature. both of the b. longum genomes encode type i and two type ii r-m systems that are highly conserved . they also contain an mrr system that is predicted to restrict methylated dna  that is 100% conserved between both strains . the clustering of mrr with the type i r-m system is similar to e. coli k <dig> . the low identity  between the hsds proteins in the two strains likely reflects the independent evolution of this type i r-m system in these strains following their evolutionary divergence, as these systems evolve by changing their specificity components  to enable it to recognize different sequences. this is substantiated by the existence of an hsds gene that was inactivated by an is <dig> insertion event and both parts of this disrupted gene exhibit much higher conservation, suggesting the insertion event occurred before their evolutionary divergence . upstream from this locus in strain djo10a there is another restriction gene, mcra , that is not present in ncc <dig>  the conserved type ii r-m systems in both strains are isoschizomers of sau3ai and ecorii which restrict dna at very frequently occurring sites . this, together with the range of restriction systems present, may be a factor in limiting the incursion of foreign dna into these bacteria thus explaining the very low electroporation frequencies reported for bifidobacteria to date.

unique genome regions in the b. longum strains
alignment of the genome sequence of b. longum djo10a with that of strain ncc <dig> illustrates that they are highly conserved and collinear, except for the mobile is and mic elements . there is also an apparent genome reduction in strain ncc <dig>  consistent with previous observations for microbes growing in a stable environment without horizontal gene transfer opportunities and redundant genes accumulating mutations before subsequent deletion  <cit> . there are  <dig> unique sequences of >  <dig> bp between the two genomes, with the majority of them being short and encoding few if any genes. this high number of unique sequences between the two strains was surprising given that the genomes of a clinical isolate of mycobacterium tuberculosis and one that was extensively passaged for decades in the laboratory display only  <dig> of such regions in genomes twice the size  <cit> . there are  <dig> larger unique regions that encode functional or hypothetical genes and range in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, with  <dig> of these unique regions present in strain djo10a encoding  <dig> predicted genes, and  <dig> unique regions in ncc <dig> encoding  <dig> genes . these unique regions are not clustered around the oric and terc which have previously been associated with regions of intraspecies variation  <cit> .

one unique region in each genome corresponds to a prophage. the prophage in strain ncc <dig>  which is truncated, appears to be a longtime resident of the genome as it does not correspond with a base deviation index  peak , as this analysis predicts recent horizontal gene transfer  events. this appears to have been replaced in the genome of strain djo10a with a different prophage, that is complete and inducible  <cit>  and corresponds with a significant bdi peak substantiating this recent hgt event. the other five unique regions in strain ncc <dig> contain largely hypothetical genes or genes of diverse functions without any significant gene clusters. however one of these regions  does encode putative xylan degradation genes, which is a function predicted to be important for competition in the large intestine. as this region corresponds to a bdi peak, it suggests it may be a recent acquisition by this strain and its evolution in the large intestine would provide the selective pressure for acquiring this unique region. of the other  <dig> unique regions in the strain djo10a, eight encode significant gene clusters involved in functions predicted to be important for competition in the large intestine, specifically oligosaccharide and polyol utilization, arsenic resistance and lantibiotic production.

oligosaccharide and polyol utilization
according to a cog functional classification  <cit> , the highest number of unique genes in strain djo10a with a predicted function belongs to the carbohydrate metabolism  category . interestingly, most of the unique genes in the carbohydrate metabolism category are involved in oligosaccharide utilization, which is the major carbohydrate source available to microbes in the large intestine. in all there are  <dig> oligosaccharide utilization gene clusters in strain djo10a, of which  <dig> are fully present and  <dig> are partially present in strain ncc <dig> . it is noteworthy that one of these clusters  contains an isl <dig> element in the ncc <dig> genome at the precise location of the extra oligosaccharide utilization genes in strain djo10a . a bdi analysis suggested that the extra oligosaccharide gene clusters in strain djo10a were not acquired following evolutionary divergence from strain ncc <dig>  as neither corresponds with a bdi peak . the majority of bdi peaks suggesting recent hgt events were the same in both genomes substantiating this analysis. this would suggest the six unique regions  encoding oligosaccharide utilization genes were likely lost from strain ncc <dig> during its adaptation to a fermentation environment. further evidence for the loss of these unique regions from strain ncc <dig> comes from a dna remnant of  <dig> bp  from the usha gene within the unique region  <dig> that was left remaining at this locus in ncc <dig> .

polyols are not digestible by humans and their metabolism is believed to be important for bacterial competition in the human large intestine and their ingestion has been implicated in increased bifidobacteria numbers  <cit> . while strain ncc <dig> does not contain genes involved in polyol metabolism, unique region  <dig> of strain djo10a is dedicated to this , containing genes involved in polyol recognition, transport and dehydration, and there are also some polyol metabolism genes in unique region  <dig>  given that unique region  <dig> does coincide with a bdi peak , it may represent gene acquisition by strain djo10a. interestingly, a similar polyol locus was found in b. adolescentis atcc  <dig> at a similar genome location .

arsenic resistance
other unique regions in strain djo10a encode gene clusters predicted to be involved in characteristics that would be important for survival and competition in the human intestine. two operons encoding atp-dependent arsenic resistance genes are in unique regions  <dig> and  <dig> and may be important for intestinal survival as the human intestine contains low concentrations of arsenic from the diet  <cit> . many intestinal bacteria such as e. coli, lactobacillus and bacteroides contain arsenic resistance genes , substantiating the competitive advantage for having this ability in the intestine. as the unique regions,  <dig> and  <dig>  containing these arsenic resistance genes do not correspond to bdi peaks , it suggests they may not be recently acquired by strain djo10a, but rather lost from strain ncc <dig>  this theory, that adaptation to a pure-culture fermentation environment can result in loss of arsenic resistance, was further substantiated by the exceptional arsenate resistance of strain djo10a which was  <dig> % greater than a fermentation adapted bifidobacterium isolate  and 100% greater than e. coli k <dig> . this would suggest that this phenotype is a competitive advantage to intestinal isolates, but not of significance for pure-culture fermentation environments.

lantibiotic production
the production of antimicrobial peptides, or bacteriocins, is an important characteristic for bacterial competition in natural environments. one exceptionally broad spectrum class of bacteriocins is the lantibiotics, which are post-translationally modified to form lanthionine residues and to date none have been isolated from any bifidobacteria. a  <dig>  kb gene cluster encoding all the genes indicative of a lantibiotic was detected in the unique region  <dig> of strain djo10a . it was also noted that this unique region did not correspond to a bdi peak, suggesting a likely loss of this region from strain ncc <dig>  as lantibiotic production would be very advantageous for microbial competition in the intestine, but of no value to a microbe in pure culture, it provides the selective pressure for the loss of this unique region  <dig> from strain ncc <dig> 

genome attenuation of b. longum in fermentation environments
given the large number of unique dna regions in the genome of strain djo10a, that are predicted to have been lost from strain ncc <dig>  it suggests that deletion of dna regions that are not useful may reflect the rapid adaptation of b. longum to a new and very different environment than exists in the human large gut. this would suggest an elevated mutation frequency. a comparative nucleotide substitution analysis between strains djo10a and ncc <dig> shows the majority of genes are highly conserved , which is to be expected with two closely related strains. however, analysis of the  <dig> least conserved genes  indicates that of the mutations that can be attributed to one strain or the other ,  <dig> are from strain ncc <dig> and three from strain djo10a . further substantiation of an increased mutation frequency in strain ncc <dig> comes from comparing genes encoding surface protein homologs between the two strains. a search of the djo10a genome for lpxtg motifs, which is a signature of one class of cell surface anchoring proteins found four potential proteins and signalp analysis of these proteins  confirmed the presence of a signal sequence in each case . in addition, blastp analysis of these four proteins showed that they are very similar to other known surface proteins containing the lpxtg motif. the ncc <dig> showed three of these gene homologs , and had a predicted protein exhibiting 99% amino acid identity to bld <dig>  but was missing the lpxtg motif due to an isl <dig> insertion in the 3' end of the gene. this further highlights the rapid evolutionary status of bifidobacteria when they are removed from the human gut into pure-culture fermentation environments.

is <dig> 'jumping' in the b. longum genome
the dynamic environment within the b. longum cell in a fermentation environment is further substantiated by the intriguing observation during genome sequencing from different batches of dna that everything was identical except for the location of some is <dig> elements . this very rapid movement of an is element within a cell has not been observed previously. the movement of is <dig> within the genome occurred only at specific sites, consistent with its insertion target specificity  <cit> .

adaptation of b. longum djo10a to a pure-culture environment
to test the hypothesis that the switch from a variable and complex environment like the gut to a relatively stable and simplified, pure-culture one, results in hyper is <dig> activity and rapid dna loss of regions that are no longer beneficial to the new environment, strain djo10a was grown in a typical laboratory medium without ph control for ~ <dig>  generations. isolated colonies were then screened for seven unique regions encoding functions predicted to be useful for survival in the human gut. one of these regions  involved in the lantibiotic production was found to be missing from 40% of the isolates  substantiating this hypothesis. analysis of this adapted strain, djo10a-jh <dig>  shows the deletion extended over the full lantibiotic region very similar to strain ncc <dig> . it is further noted using pulsed field gel electrophoresis  that the  <dig>  kb xbai band containing this region is missing from strain djo10a-jh <dig> . the loss of the complete lantibiotic gene cluster from 40% of the culture was intriguing as the cluster also encodes the immunity gene to protect cells from the lantibiotic activity. however, analysis of lantibiotic production by strain djo10a showed that none occurred during growth in broth media, and a solid surface such as agar, was needed for production  similar to streptin production from streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> . the loss of the complete lantibiotic gene cluster renders strain djo10a-jh <dig> sensitive to this pronase-e sensitive lantibiotic, which is also active against a wide spectrum of bacteria . interestingly, the lantibiotic genome region that was deleted during the adaptation of strain djo10a to the pure-culture environment was located between two is <dig> elements, suggesting its role in genome deletion events.

it was also noted that the pure-culture adapted strain, djo10a-jh <dig>  was also missing a  <dig>  kb xbai band . it is intriguing that this band contains one of the four mic elements, suggesting it may have been involved. pcr analysis of the loci immediately bordering this mic element revealed the deletion extended between  <dig> and  <dig> kb directly downstream from this element substantiating its likely role in this deletion event. this further substantiated the rapid loss of dna, and the prominent role of mobile elements, during evolutionary adaptation by these bacteria.

southern hybridization of strains djo10a and djo10a-jh <dig> substantiate the is <dig> 'jumping' during growth in a pure-culture environment, while the positions of the other is elements  remained stable . this is <dig> hyperactivity in b. longum genomes may play an important role in deletion events and genome reduction during adaptation to new environments.

competitive 'fitness' of the adapted b. longum straindjo1a-jh1
the rapid genome reduction experienced by b. longum djo10a during pure-culture growth in fermentation conditions suggested that the genomic regions lost may have been important for competition in the intestine. to test if this in vitro adaptation affected the 'fitness' of the strain, a simulated fecal competitive approach was developed. bifidobacteria are frequently proposed to successfully compete against members of the clostridia and the enterobacteriae in the intestinal environment. a member of both of these bacterial groups was selected to test the relative competitive abilities of b. longum djo10a and its in vitro adapted derivative, strain djo10a-jh <dig>  to ensure that the selected competitor strains were not attenuated in any way, new isolates were obtained from fresh feces by plating on selective media and speciated using a sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene. this resulted in the isolation of clostridium difficile djocd <dig> and e. coli djoec <dig>  which were minimally cultured prior to undergoing fecal competitive experiments with the b. longum strains. an in vitro growth rate analysis established that e. coli djoec <dig> had the fastest growth rate, followed by c. difficile djocd <dig>  b. longum djo10a-jh <dig> and b. longum djo10a . the noticeable increased growth rate of b. longum djo10a-jh <dig> compared to strain djo10a substantiated that the genome reduction of strain djo10a-jh <dig> favored the in vitro growth environment.

competitive growth experiments with both e. coli djoec <dig> and c. difficile djocd <dig> in a simulated anaerobic fecal environment revealed that b. longum djo10a had a significantly greater ability to compete against both e. coli and c. difficile . the significantly greater reduction in both these groups of bacteria by b. longum djo10a supports the genome analysis hypothesis that the genome reduction exhibited in pure-culture growth may compromise a bacterium's ability to compete in its original environment.

while the simulated fecal competition studies suggested that the lantibiotic encoding genome region was important for competition in the human intestine, in vivo studies in an intestinal model would be necessary to verify this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study compares the genomic sequences of two strains of b. longum and suggests that bifidobacteria can rapidly loose genome regions during pure-culture growth that may be important for intestinal survival. this genomic prediction was experimentally validated during pure-culture growth of strain djo10a and the genome reduction was shown to reduce competitive 'fitness' in a simulated fecal environment. the rapid loss of genomic regions that may be important for intestinal competition may compromise the ability of exogenous bifidobacteria to re-colonize human intestines.
