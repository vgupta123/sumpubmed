BACKGROUND
the repressor element- <dig> silencing transcription factor  silences neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues and in neural stem cells of vertebrates to restrict their expression to neurons and to prevent premature differentiation, respectively  <cit> . rest binds to a conserved 21-bp neuron-restrictive silencing element  in the flanking regulatory regions or introns of many neuronal genes  <cit>  and recruits the cofactors corest  <cit>  and sin3a  <cit>  to form repressor complexes with histone deactylases  <cit> , histone modifying proteins  <cit> , the methyl-cpg-binding protein mecp  <cit>  and components of the swi-snf chromatin remodeling complexes  <cit> . together these proteins change the architecture of dna to heterochromatin and silence target genes  <cit> .

rest is critical for the maintenance of neural stem cells  <cit>  and the regulation of neurogenesis. for neuron specific genes to be expressed and neurogenesis to proceed, rest activity is diminished in neural stem cells by two mechanisms; rest transcripts are down-regulated  <cit>  and rest protein is targeted for degradation in the proteasome by the beta-tranducin repeat containing/f-box protein with wd <dig> domain  <dig>   <cit> . although rest is most commonly reported to silence the expression of protein-coding genes, recent studies suggest that it also regulates non-coding rnas involved in neurogenesis  <cit> . for example, the neuron specific micrornas mir-9* and mir- <dig>  important for repression of baf53a  mediated chromatin remodeling and cell cycle exit, are repressed by rest in neural progenitors  <cit> . rest has also been shown to regulate and interact with long non-coding rnas  to control neurogenesis  <cit> . as an example, the nuclear lncrna, lncrna_n <dig>  physically interacts with rest during differentiation of hescs  to promote neurogenesis  <cit> .

in this study, we performed a screen for rest binding sites and targets in the genome of the diploid amphibian xenopus tropicalis, a model system for genetics and development. using a degenerate  <dig> bp sequence derived from  <dig> bona fide rest targets, we identified  <dig> nrse motifs associated with  <dig> protein-coding genes. the nrse distance to genes, number of nrses per gene, and the suite of neuronal genes associated with nrses in frog are conserved with mouse and human. through a literature search, we identified which putative target genes are expressed in neuronal tissues and with expression analysis, we verified the restriction of expression of four f-box genes to neuronal tissues. in addition, we found that nrses are associated with long non-coding rnas but not other classes of non-coding rnas in the human genome.

RESULTS
identification of nrse sites in the xenopus tropicalis genome
to identify nrse sites in the x. tropicalis genome, we performed an in silico screen of the genome for a  <dig> bp degenerate nrse consensus motif  generated from  <dig> bona fide rest target genes in human, rodents, and chicken  <cit> . the consensus nrse motif has two highly conserved regions  separated by a linker region that consists of  <dig> poorly conserved nucleotides   <cit> . the consensus nrse motif does not include the lesser-conserved  <dig> nucleotides at the 3′ end found in the canonical  <dig> bp consensus  <cit> . we retrieved all nrse sites and annotated each site based on genomic location . we found  <dig> nrse sites with  <dig> permutations in the xenopus genome. the consensus sequence of the xenopus nrse varies slightly from that of human. for example, whereas nucleotide a is predominant at position  <dig> in the human nrse consensus, both a and g are in high occupancy at this position in xenopus  .figure  <dig> in x. tropicalis, human, and mouse, the consensus nrse motifs share sequence similarity and the majority of the nrse sites are farther than  <dig> kb from a gene, with a single copy per gene. a. sequence logos of the consensus nrse motif derived from  <dig> bona fide mouse rest target genes , from  <dig> human nrse motifs , and from  <dig> x. tropicalis nrse motifs . arrowheads mark the differences between the xenopus and human consensus motifs. b. in all three vertebrate genomes, ~ 65% of the motifs are located farther than  <dig> kb from a gene. c. 80% to 90% of the putative rest target genes in three organisms have a single nrse motif within  <dig> kb of a gene.



rest binds to nrses in intergenic and intragenic regions  <cit> . to determine the location of nrse motifs with respect to genes, we used a cut-off distance of nrse to genes of  <dig> kb to facilitate the comparison of our screen to one in mammals using the same degenerate sequence  <cit> . in human, mouse, and xenopus, the majority of the nrses are located in the flanking regions of genes at a distance greater than  <dig> kb . next, we identified the number of motifs within  <dig> kb of a gene . common in both mammals and xenopus, 80-90% of putative rest target genes are associated with a single motif; less than 10% of the targets genes are associated with two or more motifs .

to determine the proportion of xenopus nrses that are directly orthologous to the human nrses, we retrieved pairwise alignments of human  and x. tropicalis  genomes generated by genome-wide comparison using blastz  <cit>  from the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  and analyzed the homologous sequences for the presence of nrse sites. with a chain score cutoff of  <dig>  the summed length of homologous xenopus regions in the pairwise alignments was  <dig> , <dig> bp, or 2% of the xenopus genome. we identified  <dig> homologous regions with sizes ranging from 42– <dig> bp that have nrse motifs in the xenopus homolog. however, only  <dig> of these  <dig> have an nrse motif in the human homolog. thus,  <dig> % of the xenopus nrse sites are in regions of the genome with homology to the human genome, and only 14% of those regions have nrse sites in both species. the small number of homologous regions with nrses is likely due to the low level of homology in non-coding regions between frogs and humans.

in total, we demonstrated that the nrse consensus, distance from gene, and the number of motifs within  <dig> kb of a gene are similar in xenopus, mouse, and human. however, the locations of nrse motifs in homologous regions are not conserved among frogs and humans.

species-specific features of x. tropicalis nrses
the xenopus consensus motif deviates slightly from that of human and mouse. to determine where these differences lie, we first determined the frequency of each nrse motif permutation in the genome. the degenerate nrse sequence used to search the genome can produce  <dig> permutations; however, only  <dig> permutations were represented in the x. tropicalis genome. the  <dig> motif permutations in  <dig> unique genomic loci had varying frequencies in the genome. nearly  <dig> motif permutations are present only once in the genome while the most abundant motif is replicated  <dig> times . the most common motif in the human genome is the third most common in the x. tropicalis genome. the only difference between these two motifs is a single nucleotide change in the linker region; t at position  <dig> of the xenopus motif and c in human. it has been shown that the length of the linker region, but not the identity of the nucleotides, is important for the function of rest  <cit> . therefore, the differences we found in the linker region are not likely to have an effect on the binding efficiency and gene silencing capacity of rest.figure  <dig> the species-specific features of x. tropicalis nrses. a. the most abundant  <dig> motifs and copy number in the x. tropicalis genome. the asterisk marks the most abundant motif in the humans genome. the green highlight marks the linker region  of the nrse motif. the red “c” is the only difference between the most abundant nrse motifs in xenopus and humans. b. the number of nrse motif permutations in common between the three vertebrate genomes. c. the consensus motifs derived from the  <dig> nrses in common between humans and x. tropicalis, and the  <dig> x. tropicalis specific motifs. arrowheads show the deviations from the x. tropicalis consensus derived from all motifs.



to identify the xenopus-specific motifs, we compared the xenopus nrses to the human and mouse motifs. among the  <dig> xenopus nrse motif permutations, only  <dig>  are in all three genomes .  <dig> % of the xenopus nrse motifs are found in the human genome with  <dig> motifs exclusively shared between the two, and  <dig> % of the xenopus nrses are in the mouse genome with  <dig> motifs shared exclusively. thus, approximately 70%  of the x. tropicalis motifs are unique to the xenopus genome .

we generated a x. tropicalis specific consensus nrse from  <dig> motifs and a xenopus-human consensus motif from the  <dig> motifs shared between human and xenopus . there are significant shifts in abundance of nucleotides between xenopus and human at positions  <dig> in the 5′-half of the motif, at position  <dig> in the linker region, and at position  <dig> in the 3′-half . these variations contributed to the deviation of the xenopus consensus from the mammalian one and the generation of a species-specific version of the nrse consensus motif.

17-24% of nrse motifs in the human, mouse and frog genomes are located in regions devoid of protein-coding genes
we found that 22% of all xenopus nrse sites are located in what we call “gene-distant regions” , which are regions greater than  <dig> kb from protein-coding genes . to investigate the function of the nrses in gd, we first compared the gd consensus motif to that of nrses located within  <dig> kb of a protein coding gene. there was no difference in consensus motif sequences distinguishing the motifs in low gene occupancy regions as non-functional . to test whether these motifs may be involved in the regulation of non-coding rnas , we analyzed the relationship of the nrses with ncrnas in the human genome since these are better annotated than xenopus ncrnas and there are fewer gaps than in the xenopus genome. assembly gaps increase error in estimations of distances between nrses and genes. using our screen to retrieve nrses in the human genome, we identified  <dig> motifs. we eliminated  <dig> of the  <dig> nrses, because they are located on unassigned scaffolds, and therefore prone to errors in distance calculations. the distribution of distances from  <dig> nrses to the nearest protein-coding genes ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> kb, with a mean of  <dig>  kb and a median of only  <dig>  kb. of the  <dig> nrses,  <dig>  are located in gd. of the nrses in gene-distant regions,  <dig>  are located within  <dig> kb of ncrnas, while  <dig>  of all nrses are associated with ncrnas genome-wide. of the ncrna classes provided by ensembl , nrses are associated most frequently with lncrnas;  <dig>  of the nrses in gd are located within  <dig> kb of lncrna genes, while  <dig>  of all nrses are associated with lncrna genome-wide .figure  <dig> human nrses are associated with lncrnas genome-wide but not in gene-distant regions. a. 17-24% of nrse motifs in the human, mouse and frog genomes are located in gene-distant regions . b. in the human genome, nrses within  <dig> kb of ncrnas are associated with lncrnas . in the figure, < <dig> kb denotes the nrses that are within  <dig> kb of a protein-coding gene and > <dig> kb is for nrses that are located in gd.



we performed chi-square tests to determine whether the numbers of nrses associated with ncrna and protein-coding genes were greater than expected by chance. expected counts were estimated by shuffling the coordinates of the human nrse motifs. to test for significant associations of nrse with the five ncrna classes  and protein-coding genes on a genome-wide basis, the coordinates of the  <dig> nrse were shuffled within each chromosome  <dig> times such that shuffled nrse coordinates were not allowed to fall within assembly gaps. for each class of ncrna gene, the number of nrses within  <dig> kb of a gene was determined for each shuffled dataset, and the average numbers of  <dig> datasets were used as expected counts in chi-square tests . we found that nrse sites genome-wide are associated with lncrnas more often than expected by chance , but there are no significant associations of nrse with any other class of ncrna. not surprisingly, nrses are found within  <dig> kb of protein-coding genes more often than expected by chance . the significant association of nrses with lncrnas on a genome-wide basis may have been due to the frequency of lncrnas in close proximity to protein-coding genes.

we next evaluated the subset of  <dig> nrses that are not located within  <dig> kb of protein-coding genes . again, we shuffled the nrse coordinates within each chromosome  <dig> times. in addition to disallowing shuffled nrse coordinates to fall within assembly gaps, we did not allow shuffled nrses to fall within  <dig> kb of protein-coding genes. using the average counts from  <dig> datasets to estimate numbers of nrse within  <dig> kb of ncrnas, the chi-square tests did not show a significant association of nrse with any class of ncrna given the nrse were located in gd .

a conserved group of putative rest target genes is enriched in neuronal development and function
we identified  <dig> unique protein-coding genes in the x. tropicalis genome that are within  <dig> kb of one or more nrse motifs .

to distinguish functional groups within the gene list, we retrieved gene ontology  terms for x. tropicalis genes using ensembl biomart . the go terms were further categorized into fourteen general functional groups .figure  <dig> gene ontology classification of putative nrse target genes. a. genes were linked to  <dig> functional groups or “others” subgroup based on go descriptions. b. the  <dig> common nrse target genes in human, mouse, and frog genomes are enriched in neuronal functions. all categories are statistically significant with single and double asterisks showing p-values < <dig>  and < <dig> , respectively.



to determine whether there was a conserved core of rest target genes in vertebrates, we first identified the genes in common within  <dig> kb of the  <dig> conserved nrses in the homologous regions of the xenopus and human genomes. we identified  <dig> genes within  <dig> kb of the  <dig> conserved nrses in the xenopus genome  and  <dig> genes in the human genome with  <dig> genes in common . gene ontology analysis showed that of the  <dig> common genes, bdnf  <cit> , pou4fl  <cit> , rnf <dig>  <cit>  and setd <dig>  <cit>  have functions in neurogenesis and disease of the nervous system.

we broadened the search for a conserved set of vertebrate target genes to include targets shared with mouse, human and xenopus. we first identified all of the genes within  <dig> kb of an nrse motif in human and mouse . only  <dig>  of the x. tropicalis genes within  <dig> kb of an nrse motif  are also putative rest targets in mouse and human based on comparison of gene names . the list of shared genes, categorized into functional go groups using g: profiler software , are significantly enriched in neuronal functions, including voltage-gated cation channel activity, transmission of nerve pulse, neuron projection, and regulation of nervous system development . these genes may comprise a core group of protein-coding genes that are central to rest-meditated gene silencing.table  <dig>

in silico validation of the nrse screen
the xenopus nrse screen successfully identified  <dig> of  <dig> bona fide rest target genes  <cit> . we also used two in silico approaches to validate the screen. first, we searched xenbase, a publicly available gene expression database for x. tropicalis and x. laevis  <cit> , for the spatial expression profile of each gene with an nrse motif as determined by whole mount in situ hybridizations. neuronal– and heart-restricted genes  <cit>  including those expressed in the neural plate, neural tube, brain, spinal cord, and eyes  were considered true positives. although rest splice variants are also expressed in thymus, kidney, testis, lung, spleen, and muscle  <cit> , the experimental evidence for rest function in these peripheral tissues is lacking. therefore, we did not include gene expression in such peripheral tissues to indicate regulation by rest. expression elsewhere was considered a false positive. out of  <dig> genes, only  <dig> had in situ expression data in xenbase . among  <dig> genes, expression of  <dig> genes  is restricted to neuronal and heart tissues. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are among the  <dig> putative rest target genes common in human, mouse, and frog genomes.table  <dig>

the published rest chip-seq data in human  <cit>  was also used to validate the putative rest targets genes conserved among xenopus, mouse and human in our in silico screen. the rest chip-seq analysis identified  <dig>  of the  <dig> putative rest target genes shared between mouse, human and frog indicating these as true targets of rest . thus, the in silico validation of our screen suggests that we successfully identified putative rest target genes in the xenopus genome.

in vivo validation of the nrse screen
the link between rest and protein degradation has not been well established although both have fundamental roles in neurogenesis  <cit> . towards understanding the regulatory relationship between rest and protein degradation, we studied  <dig> f-box genes fbxo <dig>  fbxo <dig>  fbxl <dig>  and fbxl <dig>  identified in our screen. f-box proteins are the e <dig> ligase components of ring type ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . the nrse motifs associated with the f-box genes are located upstream or downstream of the genes at a distance > <dig> kb except for fbxl <dig>  which has an nrse within  <dig>  kb of the gene start . there is an intervening gene between fbxo <dig>  fbxo <dig>  and fbxl <dig> and the nrse. to determine if these genes are restricted to neuronal tissues, we analyzed their expression in x. tropicalis embryos using in situ hybridization. all four genes are expressed in the developing embryo from gastrula to tailbud stages . in early gastrulae , the genes are weakly expressed in the ectoderm with greater expression in the dorsal neuroectoderm. however, expression increases at the neurula stage  and all genes are primarily expressed in the neural tube. whereas fbxo <dig>  fbxo <dig>  and fbxl <dig> are pan neural, fbxl <dig> is localized to the anterior-most and posterior-most regions of the neural plate. at early tailbud stages , all genes are expressed in the brain with fbxo <dig>  fbxl <dig> and fbxl <dig> also expressed in the eyes and branchial arches. in xenopus, rest is maternal and uniformly expressed in the ectoderm during gastrula stages . however, the expression is diffuse in the neurula embryo including the neural folds and then later restricted to the brain and spinal cord in tailbud stages . at the cellular level, rest is expressed in neural progenitors and stem cells but excluded from differentiating and mature neurons  <cit> . our expression analysis confirmed the nrse screen and showed that the expression of four putative f-box genes is localized to neural tissues during xenopus development.figure  <dig>

discussion
with a genome-wide screen, we identified  <dig> nrse motifs associated with  <dig> protein-coding genes  in the x. tropicalis genome. we compared the data of our screen in xenopus to that of screens in human and mouse  <cit> . the three vertebrate data sets have similar features in terms of the number of nrse motifs associated with genes, their distance to genes, and the go classification of genes with nrses. furthermore, we identified four f-box ubiquitin ligases as putative rest target genes in xenopus with expression restricted to the neuronal tissues in developing embryos. our analysis, therefore, identified a new regulatory relationship between rest and the components of protein degradation machinery .

screening the xenopus genome, we identified the majority of the previously identified bona fide human rest target genes including nav <dig>   <cit> , one of the first rest target genes identified. however, we failed to identify scg <dig> , another well-studied rest target gene  <cit> . in fact, no nrse motif was present on the scaffold containing scg <dig>  to investigate the possibility that scg <dig> is regulated by an unconventional nrse motif, we searched the scaffold for partial  and bipartite nrse motifs   <cit> . we identified  <dig> 5′-half and  <dig> 3′-half motifs within  <dig> kb of scg <dig> but no bipartite motifs. this suggests that the regulation of scg <dig> expression in xenopus either involves an unconventional regulatory mechanism such as rest binding to partial motifs or is regulated independent of rest.

our genome-wide analysis was based on a conserved consensus nrse motif that allowed degeneracy at certain positions in the motif. however, it did not identify non-traditional nrse motifs such as bipartite, partial or species-specific motifs, which could only be identified through chip-seq analysis. however, our analysis using the conserved nrse motif did identify the conserved target genes among vertebrates.

it is surprising that only 8% of nrse target genes are conserved among the three vertebrate genomes. this could be due to the fact that rest is able to bind degenerate nrse motifs. in fact, the nrse motifs in functionally validated rest target genes show differences in sequence but yet satisfy rest binding  <cit> . the flexibility in binding may allow the emergence of new sites through nucleotide substitution, and hence, the recognition of new genes. as expected, we identified a larger number of conserved nrse target genes among mammals than across the greater evolutionary distance of the three vertebrates. we found more than 30% of nrse target genes to be conserved between human and mouse but only 8% were conserved among in human, mouse, and frog . the more conserved genes might have undergone high selective constraint against changes in the rest sites, and are functionally essential. lesser-conserved genes with relaxed constraints may have allowed the emergence of new nrse sites.

while our analysis did not reveal a significant association of nrses with lncrna in gene-distant regions , we did find nrses to be associated with lncrna genome-wide. our analysis could not exclude the possibility that the significant association of nrses with lncrna was due to the close proximity of lncrna and protein-coding genes. however, evidence for the regulation of lncrnas by rest continues to emerge  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
with a screen for rest binding sites in the x. tropicalis genome and a comparison of the characteristics of these binding sites in mouse, human and frog, we determined that nrses are most commonly located greater than  <dig> kb from a protein-coding gene in single copies, that there is a xenopus-specific consensus, that only  <dig> % of the xenopus nrses are also in mouse and human and that there is a conserved core of putative rest target genes enriched in neuronal function in these three vertebrates. we also identified four f-box proteins as putative target proteins thereby linking ubiquitin-mediated degradation with regulation of neurogenesis.
