BACKGROUND
the vertebrate diencephalon/mesencephalon homeobox  <dig>  gene belongs to the k <dig> subclass of paired-like homeobox genes  whose expression in the neural plate has been shown to demarcate the presumptive mesencephalic  territory in mouse  <cit> , chick  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> . after neural tube formation, dmbx <dig> is predominantly expressed in the hindbrain, posterior forebrain and midbrain. loss of function studies highlight a role for dmbx <dig>  and dmbx1a  in proper midbrain and hindbrain development and in the case of zebrafish development of the retinotectal pathway  <cit> , although in mouse the loss of function embryonic phenotype is comparatively mild. moreover, early postnatal lethality occurs in the vast majority of dmbx <dig> knockout mice. those that survive to adulthood predominantly display hypophagia and hyperactivity, likely a result of defects in the development of neural circuitry involved in energy homeostasis  <cit> .

genomic sequence analyses indicate that basal metazoans, such as ctenophores  <cit> , and poriferans  <cit> , do not have a dmbx <dig> gene. however, a putative dmbx <dig> ortholog has been identified in the cnidarian genome  <cit> , suggesting a pre-bilaterian origin of the dmbx <dig> homeobox gene family during animal evolution. non-chordate invertebrate dmbx <dig> orthologs have not been clearly identified, but based on overall class homology and function, the drosophila pph13/mu gene is a plausible candidate  <cit> . a single dmbx <dig> gene exists in the genomes of terrestrial vertebrates, while teleost genomes contain at least two paralogs: dmbx1a and dmbx1b   <cit> , coincident with the more recent additional round of gene/genome duplication that is speculated to have occurred in the teleost lineage  <cit> . this has lead us to examine why both copies of the dmbx <dig> gene duplicate have been retained in the zebrafish genome.

the retention of functional gene duplicates  in genomes is often attributed to their role in buffering against loss-of-function mutations in one copy of an essential gene  <cit> . however, the proportion of genes that when deleted are embryonic lethal or lead to infertility in mouse  is not significantly different between duplicates and singletons  <cit> . even though protein sequences of some paralogous genes in vertebrates are functionally interchangeable  <cit> , paralogs can evolve distinct expression patterns and functions. the subfunctionalization model suggests that subsequent to gene duplication, degenerative mutations in regulatory or coding regions of the gene result in complementary expression patterns or function, respectively, the composite of which would be representative of the pre-duplicated ancestral gene  <cit> . this appears to be a predominant mechanism in teleosts  <cit> . neofunctionalization has also been proposed to account for the retention of duplicate genes  <cit> . a recent genome wide study in xenopus laevis indicated that as many as 6% of duplicate genes exhibit an asymmetric rate of non-synonymous substitution in one of the paralogs, which is consistent with a neofunctionalization model for paralog retention  <cit> . however, experimental evidence for neofunctionalization in vertebrates is limited.

our previous gene expression analyses of zebrafish dmbx1a and dmbx1b showed that despite conservation in the regulation of expression within particular regions , there were clear differences in onset, spatial distribution and relative abundance during the first two days of development  <cit> . these differences in regulation correlated with variation in the extent of genomic sequence conservation between the paralogs in three separate fish species  <cit> . we also noted that although the amino acid sequence similarity was high  between the paralogs, this was mostly due to the n-terminus and dna binding domain, whereas much of the c-terminus contained relatively divergent sequence. from these results, we concluded that the zebrafish dmbx <dig> paralogs might have been subfunctionalized during the course of their evolution.

here, we examined the functional requirement of zebrafish dmbx1a and dmbx1b during neural development using morpholino oligonucleotide based loss of function to decipher a possible mechanism for the retention of these duplicate genes. we demonstrate that neither functional redundancy nor subfunctionalization is an adequate model to account for the retention of these paralogs in the zebrafish genome. instead, we show that both genes are required during development. loss of function of dmbx1a and dmbx1b causes a prolonged progenitor cell cycle in the midbrain and retina, which results in reduced growth, and a significant defect in differentiation. although these knockdown phenotypes can be rescued by exogenous zebrafish dmbx <dig> mrna, they cannot be efficiently rescued by exogenous mouse dmbx <dig> mrna to the same degree. finally, analyses of the rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution in the coding region of dmbx <dig> genes provide evidence for post-duplication positive selection in the dmbx1a and dmbx1b gene families of teleost fish. these data suggest that both zebrafish dmbx <dig> paralogous genes are non-redundantly required for cell cycle exit regulation and differentiation. although the differences in gene expression domains between the dmbx <dig> paralogs is subtle at late embryonic and early larval stages, the knockdown data demonstrate that regional functional specialization, especially with respect to dmbx1a, exists. thus, the function of dmbx <dig> genes in teleost fish may be evolutionarily diverged.

RESULTS
discrete variation in the timing and distribution of dmbx1a and dmbx1b gene expression during the early larval stage
previous analyses suggested that the dmbx1a and dmbx1b paralogs displayed partially divergent spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in early development  <cit> . for example, between shield and tailbud stages, dmbx1a has a characteristic annulus expression pattern specifying the midbrain territory, as well as progenitor cells of retinal and diencephalic lineages, whereas dmbx1b expression during these stages is barely detectable and appears later at mid-somitogenesis only in the presumptive midbrain  <cit> . between  <dig> -  <dig> hpf, the expression domains of these two genes partially overlapped in the midbrain and hindbrain, but neither gene is expressed in the retina. we analyzed the expression patterns of the dmbx <dig> paralogs in the brain and retina during the late embryonic to early larval stages using in situ hybridization in order to clarify where the paralogs exert their function during development.

at  <dig> hpf, dmbx1a was expressed in the optic tectum  and very weakly in the tegmentum  . scattered cells of the retinal inner nuclear layer  and ganglion cell layer  also express dmbx1a . however, there is very weak or no dmbx1a expression in the photoreceptor layer and no expression in the ciliary marginal zone , where the post-embryonic retinal stem and progenitor cells undergo continual proliferation  <cit> . dmbx1a is also expressed in discrete hindbrain cell populations that appear to demarcate the cerebellar eminentia granularis  anteriorly  and the medulla oblongata posteriorly . in addition, dmbx1b was expressed throughout the midbrain and within the medulla at  <dig> hpf , but only very weakly in the inl and eg .

expression analyses at  <dig> hpf continued to reveal discrete variation in the distribution of cells expressing dmbx1a and dmbx1b. for example, dmbx1a is predominantly localized to the medial and lateral compartments of the teo in the midbrain and weak expression is detected in the tegmentum , whereas dmbx1b expression extends more ventrally to encompass more of the tegmentum . this difference in dorsoventral expression domains is consistent with our previous observations at  <dig> -  <dig> hpf  <cit> . furthermore, the predominantly tectal expression of dmbx1a is similar to that of mouse dmbx <dig>  <cit> . expression of dmbx1b in the anterolateral hindbrain is also more substantial at this stage, but not quite comparable to dmbx1a . finally, both dmbx1a and dmbx1b are expressed throughout the retinal inl, but dmbx1a appears enhanced and localized to the central region of the inl, whereas dmbx1b expression is relatively diffuse and less intense throughout most layers .

taking into account the relative temporal, spatial, and quantitative expression patterns of the dmbx <dig> paralogs in the first  <dig> days of life , our data suggests that dmbx <dig> genes would predominantly function in midbrain formation, plus a role in retinal and hindbrain development during later differentiation. therefore, we sought to compare the functional requirement of dmbx1a and dmbx1b.

gene knockdown using dmbx <dig> paralog specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides
given the high degree of sequence similarity between the dmbx <dig> paralogs, our strategy for using antisense morpholino oligonucleotide  based knockdown required confirmation that paralog specific mos could independently block translation of dmbx1a and dmbx1b mrna. in the absence of commercially available antibodies that are validated to detect zebrafish dmbx1a or dmbx1b proteins, we opted for an alternative approach to estimate the level of protein knockdown for each paralog. we constructed in-frame gfp fusion constructs containing the unique paralog specific mo targeting sequences, and co-injected each of the mos with their corresponding in vitro transcribed fusion mrnas . when either dmbx1a-gfp  or dmbx1b-gfp  fusion mrna was injected, ~75% of the embryos had bright ubiquitous gfp protein expression after  <dig> hpf . gfp expression was completely suppressed in embryos that were co-injected with mo1a + dmbx1a-gfp  or mo1b + dmbx1b-gfp , indicating that the mos result in very efficient translation inhibition.

in order to control for mo sequence specificity, we also co-injected the gfp fusion mrna constructs with a 5-bp mismatched mo  and quantified the percentage of injected embryos that were gfp positive after  <dig> hpf. of the embryos that were co-injected with mmo1a + dmbx1a-gfp  or mmo1b + dmbx1b-gfp , ~ <dig> - 80% of the embryos demonstrated ubiquitous gfp expression, which was similar to the percentage of fusion construct injected embryos expressing gfp without mo co-injection. these results indicate that the knockdown of either gfp fusion construct depends precisely on the complementary mo sequences.

we further examined the paralog specific knockdown characteristics of the mos in order to confirm that there were no cross-target effects. co-injection of mo1b + dmbx1a-gfp  or mo1a + dmbx1b-gfp  resulted in ~ <dig> - 80% of the embryos with ubiquitous gfp expression in injected embryos after  <dig> hpf. again, the numbers of gfp positive embryos within the test pool were comparable to the results obtained from injecting the gfp fusion mrna alone, indicating that it is unlikely that cross targeting of mos is occurring. these data suggest that the mo knockdown of the dmbx1-gfp fusion proteins, and by inference the endogenous dmbx <dig> proteins, is both efficient and paralog specific.

midbrain growth defects in embryos with reduced levels of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b
the early onset and sustained expression of dmbx1a and dmbx1b within the midbrain suggested that these genes play an important role in the development of this neuroanatomical structure. morphological analyses were carried out to compare the mo-injected embryos  with mmo-injected  as well as un-injected controls. after  <dig> hpf, we were able to detect subtle differences in the size of the midbrain , but this morphological change was more prominent at  <dig> hpf, where the size of the dorsal tectum of the mo1a-injected embryos was reduced  compared to un-injected  and mmo1a-injected embryos , consistent with previous results using the same morpholino   <cit> . we observed that the overall cross-sectional area  of the tectal hemispheres is diminished in the mo1a morphant, but that the shape of the contours of the tectal hemispheres and the extent of the cerebellar plate  remains relatively unaffected. we analyzed transverse sections to quantify these differences by measuring the average cross-sectional area of the tectal wall unilaterally  and observed a reduction of ~ 50% in the mo1a morphants compared to controls at the same position along the anteroposterior axis . interestingly, the tectal morphology of mo1b morphant embryos  was also affected compared to mmo1b control injected embryos , and cross-sectional area measurements revealed a ~ 35% reduction in size .

knockdown of both dmbx <dig> genes simultaneously  resulted in an obvious change in the overall morphology of the tectum  compared to the double control injected  embryos . in order to compare with the single morphant embryos, we co-injected  <dig> ng of each morpholino. in contrast to the single morphant phenotype, we observed that the shape of the tectal hemispheres in the double morphant often was abnormal and that the extent of the cep was reduced, which can be observed from a dorsal perspective . despite the more extensive morphological alterations in the double morphants, the overall cross-sectional area of the tectal hemispheres was reduced to a similar degree  when compared to the differences observed in the single morphant analyses . overall we observed that the average tectal cross-sectional areas in a transverse section of the un-injected and mmo <dig> injected embryos ranged between  <dig> -  <dig> μm <dig>  whereas the morphant embryos had an average area that ranged between 2800- <dig> μm <dig>  which were statistically significantly less than their cognate controls, but not significantly different from each other. the overall growth of the morphant embryos was not significantly impaired by  <dig> hpf  and we confirmed that after normalizing the tectal cross-sectional area measurements to embryo length, the area in the double morphants was significantly reduced compared to un-injected  as well as the mmo1a + mmo1b injected  embryos, whereas the two control groups were not significantly different .

midbrain gene expression defects in embryos with reduced levels of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b
in order to determine whether the loss of function of dmbx1a and dmbx1b altered neural differentiation, various neural markers were examined using whole-mount in situ hybridization focusing on the combined knockdown of dmbx <dig> genes. otx <dig>  foxb <dig> , and lim <dig> were examined at  <dig> hpf and the expression of these markers in the optic tecta was decreased in the morphants compared to control embryos . the expression of otx <dig> in the retina indicated a reduced overall size in the morphant embryos beginning at  <dig> hpf . expression of foxb <dig>  in the tectum was virtually eliminated in the double morphants , but there was no change in foxb <dig>  expression in the ventral diencephalic domain or in the mhb. similarly, expression of lim <dig>  was significantly reduced in the posterior tectum adjacent to the mhb, but not altered in the cerebellar primordium on the posterior side of the mhb. expression of egr2b   and pax2a  confirmed that early specification and segmentation in the hindbrain region was relatively unaffected in the double morphant embryos at this stage. nonetheless, judging by the foxb <dig>  expression, specific subpopulations of hindbrain precursors may be affected and analyses of transverse sections demonstrate that overall tissue growth of the hindbrain was reduced . interestingly, pax2a expression within the optic stalk region was significantly enhanced . this is consistent with the fact that dmbx1a expression during gastrula stages partially overlaps with anterior neural plate cells destined for a retinal fate  <cit>  and suggests that in the absence of dmbx1a some of these cells are transformed toward an optic stalk identity  <cit>  while delaying further retinal development during optic cup formation. this may partly explain the persistent rx <dig> progenitor cell marker expression in the dmbx1a morphant retina up to  <dig> hpf  <cit> , even though dmbx <dig> genes are not apparently expressed in the retina proper before this stage. finally, we examined in more detail the expression of markers of the mhb , as well as markers for various telencephalic and diencephalic structures  between  <dig> -  <dig> hpf. in general, we observed no significant differences between the double morphant embryos and controls in the mhb  or the forebrain , although we note that there is an apparent increase in fgf <dig> expression in rostral telencephalon of the morphant embryos , which correlates with a loss of dlx2a in the ventral telencephalon . this could have implications for telencephalic development.

the specific loss of foxb <dig>  expression in midbrain and hindbrain regions in the double morphants suggested that the development of specific sub-regions with dmbx <dig> gene expression were compromised as a result of gene knock down. however, given that dmbx1a and dmbx1b have partially non-overlapping expression domains, we also investigated foxb <dig>  expression in single morphant embryos. knockdown of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b caused a significant reduction in foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain, which was enhanced further in the double morphants . however, in the hindbrain, foxb <dig>  expression in the anterolateral domain  was eliminated only in the presence of mo1a and not mo1b , which is consistent with the expression of dmbx1a and absence of dmbx1b in this region at  <dig> hpf . although the trigeminal ganglion is also present in this anterior-lateral domain, it does not appear to be defective in the mo1a morphant as indicated by the relatively normal expression of gfp in the isl2b:gfp transgenic embryos . the posterior-medial domain of foxb <dig>  expression was reduced in the mo1a + mo1b injected embryos . we performed a dose-response analysis for morpholino efficacy using foxb <dig>  gene expression as a reliable correlated readout for the midbrain development defects observed at  <dig> hpf. when  <dig> ng of either mo1a or mo1b was used, there was no discernable change in foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain  compared to un-injected controls . however, when  <dig> ng of either mo1a or mo1b was injected separately, a similar reduction in foxb <dig>  expression and size of the midbrain was observed . combined injection of  <dig> ng mo1a and  <dig> ng mo1b caused a significant reduction in foxb <dig>  expression . furthermore, we confirmed that the ventral diencephalic/hypothalamic  and mhb  expression of foxb <dig>  were relatively less affected in the morphants. thus, dmbx1a and dmbx1b appear to be independently required for region-specific midbrain and hindbrain development perhaps through a synergistic mechanism.

retinal growth defects in embryos with reduced levels of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b
comparing our previous expression analyses  <cit>  with the present results , the onset of expression of dmbx1a within the retina  occurs ~ <dig> hpf, whereas retinal expression of dmbx1b appears to be similar but slightly delayed. thus, we reasoned that a requirement for both dmbx <dig> paralogs in the retina proper would be manifest most prominently between  <dig> -  <dig> hpf. indeed, we did not observe any significant gross morphological defects in the retina in combined mo1a + mo1b injected embryos compared to controls at  <dig> hpf .

in order to determine the relative requirement of dmbx1a and dmbx1b in the development of the retina, we examined transverse sections of the retina at  <dig> hpf. single mo1a injected embryos had severely compromised differentiation and lamination  compared to the un-injected  or mmo1a injected  embryos. furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the average overall area of a mid-transverse section  of the retina in the dmbx1a morphants compared to controls . in contrast, the mo1b injected embryos displayed a relatively mild retinal differentiation phenotype   compared to the un-injected  and mmo1b injected  controls. however, similar to the dmbx1a morphants, the dmbx1b morphants demonstrated an overall reduction in the average mid-transverse area of the retina . from these results we predicted that the combined mo1a + mo1b injected embryos would resemble the mo1a injected embryos. indeed, the severe defect in differentiation in the double morphant  compared to controls  appeared identical to that of the single mo1a morphant. interestingly, the reduction in the average mid-transverse area in the double morphants was not significantly different from that observed in the single morphant embryos, ranging from  <dig> - 60% less than controls . these observations indicate that retinal growth is primarily dependent on the dmbx1a paralog, which can partially compensate for the lack of dmbx1b, but that dmbx1b is also required for the proper continued growth of the retina .

the overall growth by  <dig> hpf  of the double morphant embryos was significantly less than un-injected  and mmo1a + mmo1b injected  embryos. however, despite this difference, we still confirmed that after normalizing the retinal area measurements to embryo length, the area in the double morphants was significantly reduced compared to un-injected  as well as the mmo1a + mmo1b injected  embryos, whereas the two control groups were not significantly different . the overall length difference in the morphants is directly related to the reduced midbrain, retina and hindbrain since other regions of the embryo appeared normal in size . we also observed that the lens was smaller in mo1a and mo1a+mo1b morphants. although the peripherally localized epithelial cells are present, in all cases there appears to be a defect in the differentiation of fiber cells forming the characteristic darkly stained concentric rings. this defect may be due to a secondary disruption in the normal lens-retina interactions during development. however, we did not explore this possibility and further experiments are required to characterize this lens defect in more detail.

retinal differentiation defects in embryos with reduced levels of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b
in order to gain more insight into retinal differentiation changes due to reduced levels of the dmbx <dig> genes, we examined a panel of markers on transverse sections using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in double morphant embryos at  <dig> hpf. in control embryos, otx <dig> was mostly absent from the rgc layer, onl and the cmz, but expressed in central regions of the inl at  <dig> hpf . in the double morphant embryos, otx <dig> expression appeared expanded and relatively uniform throughout the central retina, but not in the cmz . consistent with the notion that differentiation of at least some of the retinal cell types is reduced in the morphant embryos, we observed a significant expansion of vsx2-expressing stem and/or progenitor cells in the cmz  <cit>  compared to controls . there was also an increase in neurod-expressing cells , a marker of photoreceptor progenitor cells  <cit> . together these data reveal that reduced levels of dmbx <dig> results in a persistent progenitor identity in cells throughout the retina, which correlates with our histological analyses.

to gain greater insight into the differentiation defects of the morphant embryos, we analyzed several retinal cell-type specific markers using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. using an isl2b:gfp transgene to mark retinal ganglion cells  <cit> , we observed a reduction, but not a complete loss, of retinal ganglion cells  in the double morphant embryos compared to controls . the expression of pax <dig>  which marks most amacrine cells and a subpopulation of ganglion cells  <cit> , was also reduced . consistent with these observations, expression of pkc, which marks bipolar neurons, general markers for cone photoreceptors , rod photoreceptors , and müller glia  were almost completely abolished in the double morphant embryos . thus, although there are some differentiated ganglion cells and amacrine cells, most cells in the dmbx <dig> double morphant retina have not differentiated by  <dig> hpf, and this correlates with the relative increase in progenitor cell marker expression and morphology.

based on our histological analyses, we predicted that the effects of gene knockdown on retinal cell differentiation might be paralog-specific. thus, we carefully examined the expression of rhodopsin  in single morphant embryos compared to the double morphants as a marker for photoreceptor differentiation. consistent with our histological and immunolabeling data, mo1a injected embryos  showed a significant loss of rho expression that mimicked the double morphant phenotype . the mo1b injected embryos, in contrast, had a less attenuated rho expression phenotype , confirming that loss of dmbx1b in the retina results in a less severe differentiation phenotype. previous analyses demonstrated that knockdown of dmbx1a alone caused defects in retinotectal projections and reduced terminal fields within the teo  <cit> . we confirmed this observation in mo1a injected embryos using a tgzc <dig> transgenic zebrafish line that robustly marks the rgcs in the retina, their axonal trajectories along the retinotectal pathway, and the contralateral terminal fields in the teo  <cit> . approximately 75% of mo1a injected embryos  showed a defasciculated optic nerve prior to the chiasma compared to control   as well as reduced terminal fields in the teo . in contrast, the retinotectal projection in mo1b injected embryos  appeared normal , which could be due to the presence of normal levels of dmbx1a. if so, then a functional role of dmbx1b in rgc development may be absent. thus, we predicted that the retinotectal projection in the double morphants would resemble that of the mo1a injected embryos. again in approximately 75% of embryos, we observed a significant defect in the retinotectal projections when both paralogs are knocked down , with significantly reduced terminal fields in the teo and optic nerve defasciculation . these data suggest that dmbx1a has a predominant role in the development of the retinotectal projection, compared to dmbx1b, which was due to a defect in rgc differentiation, a defect in the development of the teo, or both.

we examined the relative requirement of each paralog in retinal differentiation by performing a similar dose response analysis as mentioned above using rho gene expression as a reliable correlated readout for the retinal defects observed at  <dig> hpf. in contrast to the observations made for foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain/hindbrain,  <dig> ng of mo1a resulted in a substantial reduction  in the extent of rho expression in the retina, whereas  <dig> ng of mo1b resulted in a negligible difference in rho expression compared to un-injected controls . however, when  <dig> ng of mo1a and mo1b was combined for a total of  <dig> ng injected, we observed a significant reduction in rho expression . when  <dig> ng of mo1a was injected individually, a similar reduction in rho expression and size of the retina is observed when compared to the double morphants derived from injections of  <dig> ng of each morpholino combined . unexpectedly, when  <dig> ng of mo1b was injected individually, a relatively mild reduction in rho expression was observed compared to controls . these data suggest that dmbx1a has a predominant functional role in retinal differentiation and that dmbx1b may only have a minor, additive role.

defects in tissue size and cell differentiation in the midbrain and retina are not due to persistent cell death
our data comparing the dmbx <dig> single and double morphants demonstrate that the size of the midbrain and retina are reduced and that neural differentiation is significantly attenuated. one possible mechanism to account for this phenotype is increased cell death in progenitor cells within these regions, resulting in diminished growth and differentiation potential of the tissue. we tested this hypothesis by examining the level of cell death at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpf using the chromatin binding fluorescent marker acridine orange  to detect apoptotic cells in live embryos  <cit> . an increased number of ao+ cells was observed in the midbrain and hindbrain at  <dig> hpf in mo1a + mo1b injected embryos compared to un-injected and mmo1a + mmo1b injected embryos . however, the growth defects in morphant embryos were not apparent until after this stage. thus, to test whether persistent apoptotic cell death was the cause of the growth defects, we analyzed ao labelling at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. little or no apoptosis was detected in any of the groups at  <dig> hpf . at  <dig> hpf, there is substantial remodelling occurring within the teleostean retinotectal pathway, which results in apoptotic cell death in both retinal and tectal tissue  <cit> . this was detected in un-injected embryos and similar levels of cell death were observed in embryos injected with a combination of mmo1a + mmo1b . in contrast, combined mo1a + mo1b injected embryos showed less ao labelling in both the midbrain and the retina compared to controls . we confirmed these observations by staining for activated caspase <dig> and by performing tunel labelling at  <dig> hpf to detect apoptotic cells. the number of caspase3+ or tunel+ nuclei in transverse sections of the midbrain  or retina  at this stage were not different between the controls and double morphants. furthermore, examination of our semi-thin plastic sections from morphant tissues did not reveal any evidence for enhanced pyknosis, cellular debris or large autophagic vacuoles relative to controls at any time point between  <dig> -  <dig> hpf, suggesting that neither necrosis nor autophagy appears to account for the morphant phenotype. thus, these data indicate that persistent cell death likely does not account for the defects in size and differentiation of the midbrain and retina in dmbx <dig> morphants.

dmbx1a and dmbx1b are required for normal progenitor cell cycle regulation
an alternative mechanism that can account for the reduced size and attenuated differentiation of midbrain and retinal tissue may entail changes in the capacity for progenitor cell proliferation. we analyzed nuclear pcna protein expression by immunohistochemistry to label cells that are actively in cell cycle  <cit> . by  <dig> hpf cell proliferation becomes substantially restricted to periventricular locations within the brain  <cit> , and the cmz in the retina  <cit>  under normal conditions. thus, we predicted that a defect in cell cycle regulation would be most evident by  <dig> hpf when neurogenic compartments are normally relatively small and very well circumscribed. pcna labelling in the brain at  <dig> hpf revealed that cell proliferation in the optic tectum is maintained throughout the entire perimeter bilaterally in the double morphants , whereas at this stage in control embryos the tectal neurogenic zones are more restricted to the lateral  and most prominently the medial  compartments . these observations reveal that the reduction of dmbx1a and dmbx1b expression caused an increase in the number of actively cycling cells in the midbrain.

to confirm these results with another cell cycle marker, we tested whether cells can incorporate 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine , a thymidine analog, during s phase of the cell cycle. embryos at  <dig> hpf received a single intracerebroventricular bolus of  <dig> mm brdu dissolved in embryo media, and subsequently processed for immunohistochemistry after a  <dig> min survival period. the combined knockdown of dmbx1a and dmbx1b caused a significant increase in brdu labelled cells , compared to controls .

an analysis of cell proliferation in the retina at  <dig> hpf yielded similar results. pcna expression in the double morphants was greatly expanded toward the central retina from the cmz , compared to the relatively few pcna+ cells in the cmz of control retinas  and this was similarly confirmed with brdu labelling . given that the retina is smaller in the morphants, an increase in pcna+ and brdu+ cells suggests that these cells might be delayed or stalled in the g1/s transition of the cell cycle. we examined the expression of phospho-histone h <dig> , which labels cells in m-phase of the cell cycle, and found that there was approximately a two-fold increase in the number of phh3+ cells  in transverse sections of the double morphant retinas primarily localized to the apical domain if the cmz and central retina  compared to controls . thus, cells are able to progress beyond s-phase of the cell cycle. we were also able to rule out that progenitor cells were undergoing endoreduplication of their dna by using propidium iodide  labelling and flow cytometry to quantify the average dna content among a population of retinal cells from  <dig> hpf embryos injected with mo1a + mo1b and compared to cells from un-injected control embryos of equivalent age. we pooled dissected retinal tissue from  <dig> embryos in both groups. the vast majority of un-injected retinal cells at this stage  were within g <dig> of the cell cycle, whereas only  <dig> % were in s phase . in contrast,  <dig> % of the morpholino injected cells were in g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and  <dig> % were in s phase . the proportion of cells in g2-m of the cell cycle in either group was < 1% and this is due to the fact that the overall fraction of the cell population captured in these short phases of the cell cycle is rather low using this method. nonetheless, there is a ~ <dig>  fold increase  in the proportion of cells in g2-m in the morphant retinas. importantly, there was no evidence of polyploidy in either the control samples or the morphant samples. therefore, these data indicate that retinal progenitor cells  in morphant embryos are not stalled in any particular phase of the cell cycle and that they complete mitosis. taken together, the smaller retinal size and increased proportion of cells that remain in cycle at  <dig> hpf suggests that progenitor cell cycle length is significantly increased.

to precisely quantify potential changes in cell cycle length in the dmbx <dig> double morphants at  <dig> hpf, we performed a brdu cumulative labelling experiment  focusing on the retina. a  <dig> mm bolus of brdu was given by intracerebroventricular  injection with survival times ranging from  <dig>  hours to  <dig>  hours at 2-hour intervals. for example, embryos in the  <dig>  hour group would receive only a single brdu injection and then processed for immunolabeling after  <dig> min. in contrast, embryos in the  <dig>  hour group would have received a total of  <dig> separate injections  and then processed for immunolabeling  <dig> min after the last injection. in preliminary experiments we determined that embryos receiving  <dig> repeated icv injections remained viable and healthy . the central assumption in this analysis is that an asynchronously dividing population of cells exhibits single population kinetics . representative confocal images of brdu labelled cells in control retinas at  <dig>  hr,  <dig>  hr, and  <dig>  hr are shown in figure 8a,c,e where proliferating cells are exclusively confined to the region of the cmz. in contrast, in dmbx <dig> double morphant retinas, brdu+ cells appear scattered through the peripheral and central retina . proliferating cells entering s-phase over time will incorporate brdu and become labelled until they re-enter s-phase, at which point they can still incorporate brdu, but they will not be marked as newly positive cells. in controls, the data during this interval  were fit to a linear regression model , which allowed us to estimate when the maximal number of brdu+ cells in the population were labelled  . thus, by ~  <dig>  hours of cumulative brdu labelling, all of the cells that are cycling in the population  are labelled and further incorporation of brdu at later time points does not increase this value. this allowed us to estimate the growth fraction in the controls to be ~11%. using these values obtained from the plotted data , we were able to estimate the progenitor cell cycle to be ~  <dig>  hours in the control retina .

the same analysis for dmbx <dig> double morphant retinas resulted in a significantly different cell cycle estimate. first, the fraction of cells incorporating brdu over time continued to increase over the entire labelling interval . therefore, were not able to accurately determine the growth fraction for the  <dig> hpf morphant retina, which would have required continuing the cumulative brdu labelling well beyond  <dig> hours. however, we reasoned that the last time point assayed  could be used as a minimum estimate for the time at which the growth fraction  is reached . therefore, a minimal estimate for the cell cycle in these morphant progenitor cells is ~ <dig>  hours, which is approximately 5-fold longer than in the control retina. this increase in cell cycle length could account for the fact that the size of the retina at  <dig> hpf is significantly smaller since on average progenitor cells in the morphant retinas would not have completed one cell division between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. our data indicate that a reduction in dmbx <dig> proteins causes a significant increase in the cell cycle time of progenitor cells in the retina  resulting is fewer differentiated cells.

rescue of the zebrafish morphant phenotype
in order to confirm the specificity of our knockdown phenotype, we co-injected either mo1a or mo1b morpholino with the corresponding zebrafish full-length mrna . microinjection of either dmbx1a mrna or dmbx1b mrna resulted in a significant dose-dependent dorsalization phenotype that was evident in embryos as early as tailbud stage and confirmed by  <dig> hpf . we therefore, titrated the mrna and evaluated the percentage of embryos co-injected with optimal amounts of mrna and morpholino that demonstrated a rescued morphant phenotype. the highest concentration of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b mrna  caused mild to severe dorsalization in ~ <dig> - 75% of the embryos injected and that ≥ 50% of these were in the severe category . because some of these embryos showed signs of necrosis at  <dig> hpf, in particular in the tail region, we opted for a lower concentration of mrna  in order to test whether the paralog specific mrna could rescue the morphant phenotype . using this lower concentration, ~ 50-70% fewer embryos were severely dorsalized .

in a separate set of experiments we tested whether zebrafish dmbx1a mrna could rescue the zebrafish mo1a morphant phenotype more by analyzing foxb <dig>  and rho gene expression. the vast majority of embryos injected with mo1a resulted in a reduction of foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain and a loss of foxb <dig>  expression in the rostrolateral hindbrain compared to the un-injected controls . furthermore, similarly treated embryos had dramatically reduced rho expression in the retina compared to un-injected controls . by co-injecting zebrafish dmbx1a mrna with mo1a, we were able to rescue the expression of foxb <dig>  in the midbrain and rostrolateral hindbrain in ~50% of the injected embryos , as well as rescue the expression of rho in the retina by over 70% of the injected embryos  . we also noticed that in embryos injected with zebrafish dmbx1a mrna  that there was a marked increase in foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain and rostromedial hindbrain . although we cannot completely rule-out subtle morpholino off-target effects, our data strongly suggest that the morphant phenotype is specifically due to the reduction in dmbx <dig> gene expression.

we also tested if the dmbx1b gene can rescue the dmbx1a morphant phenotype by examining foxb <dig>  expression in the brain. as shown above, foxb <dig>  is expressed in the dorsal midbrain and in the anterolateral hindbrain  and this pattern is similar to dmbx1a. in contrast, dmbx1b is not expressed in this anterolateral hindbrain domain, although it is expressed in the dorsal midbrain. knockdown of dmbx1a, but not dmbx1b, results in the loss of foxb <dig>  expression in the anterolateral hindbrain . therefore, we reasoned that if dmbx1b was capable of rescuing the dmbx1a morphant phenotype, then the expression of foxb <dig>  in the anterolateral hindbrain would be restored. the results showed that while dmbx1a mrna could rescue the midbrain and anterolateral hindbrain foxb <dig>  expression in ~75% of the embryos co injected with mo1a , dmbx1b mrna co-injected with mo1a was completely ineffective at restoring foxb <dig>  expression in the anterolateral hindbrain, although midbrain expression was enhanced to control levels in ~50% of the embryos . we conclude that the functionality of the dmbx <dig> paralogs, in this experimental context, is not completely interchangeable.

given the coding-sequence conservation between the mammalian dmbx <dig> genes and the teleost dmbx <dig> genes, we also examined whether the full-length mouse dmbx <dig> mrna  could rescue the mo1a phenotype. the mouse dmbx <dig> mrna yielded a comparable dorsalization phenotype only after a 2- <dig> fold relative increase in mrna was injected . however, the mouse dmbx <dig> mrna cannot rescue the foxb <dig>  morphant expression in the midbrain and anterolateral hindbrain , or the rho morphant expression in the retina , as efficiently as the zebrafish mrna. there were ~20% of the embryos co-injected with mouse mrna and mo1a that had a slight increase in rho expression , but this was substantially less than the control levels of expression . we observed similar results when comparing the mo1b rescue with zebrafish dmbx1b compared to mouse dmbx <dig> mrna .

it is possible that the mouse dmbx <dig> mrna is less stable in a zebrafish embryo accounting for the reduced potency of mouse dmbx <dig> to induce a dorsalized phenotype. unfortunately, currently available commercial antibodies for dmbx <dig> do not recognize the zebrafish proteins . therefore, in order to address whether the mouse mrna was less stable, we generated c-myc epitope-tagged mouse dmbx <dig> and zebrafish dmbx1a constructs and monitored protein levels by immunohistochemistry using an anti-c-myc antibody at tailbud after injecting into 1- <dig> cell stage embryos. compared to un-injected controls , embryos injected with either mouse myc-dmbx <dig>  or zebrafish myc-dmbx1a  resulted in protein expression. similar observations were made with injected  <dig> hpf embryos . there was some variability in the overall intensity of staining between embryos regardless of the construct used, but in all cases injected embryos had discernable nuclear staining compared to un-injected controls . thus, although subtle differences in mrna stability may not be detectable in this assay, these data suggest that there is no overt difference in the mrna stability of zebrafish and mouse mrna that would account for the inability of the mouse dmbx <dig> to rescue midbrain and retinal morphant gene expression phenotypes.

a limitation in our morphant rescue analyses relates to the dorsalization phenotype. the rescue of the brain and retinal morphant phenotypes with zebrafish dmbx <dig> mrnas is consistent with the fact that there is a significant loss of function phenotype in these specific tissues. however, the rescue of the overall mrna-induced dorsalization phenotype with co-injection of morpholino is more difficult to interpret. the onset of dmbx <dig> expression occurs as early as  <dig> hpf and the expression domain is strongest on the dorsal side close to the blastoderm margin  <cit> . it is possible that in addition to affecting the development of the midbrain territory, changes in the relative levels of dmbx <dig> expression at this early time might also indirectly affect the morphogenesis of tissues adjacent to the dmbx <dig> domain  resulting in dorsalized embryos with high concentrations of mrna. the co-injection of morpholino and zebrafish mrna is presumably sufficient to mitigate these early morphogenetic defects. however, this hypothesis remains to be tested. in contrast, the co-injection of morpholino and mouse mrna may not mitigate these early defects if the downstream effects of ectopic mouse mrna are different. in other words, the dorsalization phenotypes from zebrafish and mouse mrna injections might be caused by distinct molecular mechanisms. further experiments are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms that might account for the dorsalization defects. nonetheless, we also know that lowering the concentration of injected dmbx1a mrna tends to significantly reduce the number of dorsalized embryos , yet we are still able to observe a rescue of the foxb <dig>  expression in the brain of mo1a morphants . thus, overall these data suggest that we can achieve a reliable rescue of the zebrafish mo1a and mo1b morphant phenotypes with corresponding zebrafish dmbx <dig> mrnas.

molecular evolutionary analyses of vertebrate dmbx <dig> genes
the morphant rescue results prompted us to examine whether there are any changes in the protein coding sequences among the vertebrate dmbx <dig> genes that might correlate with the putative functional differences that we observed between the zebrafish and mouse genes. the results of a variety of phylogenetic analyses, including neighbour-joining, maximum likelihood and bayesian methods, were largely congruent with current understanding of phylogenetic relationships among vertebrates  <cit> . these analyses strongly support a fish-specific dmbx <dig> duplication event , which we previously proposed  <cit>  and may be associated with a postulated ancient genome duplication event early in the teleost lineage of fishes  <cit> .

determining the proportion of non-synonymous to synonymous  changes in the coding sequences of dmbx <dig> genes allowed us to estimate the rate of amino acid evolution as well as make inferences about any changes in the selective constraints during the evolution of this gene family in vertebrates  <cit> . the results of our molecular evolutionary analyses of dmbx <dig> genes suggest that although this family is generally quite conservative in its evolution, with an overall dn/ds of only  <dig> , there was a dramatic change in selective constraint after the duplication event which gave rise to the dmbx1a and dmbx1b families in fish . the elevation in dn/ds after this gene duplication is particularly marked in the lineage leading to dmbx1a , suggestive of positive selection; whereas estimates along the dmbx1b lineage , which are much lower, would be consistent with either weak positive selection or relaxed purifying selection. however, these results are based on analyses of a fairly small data set, which is particularly deficient in basal fish dmbx <dig> genes; the inclusion of additional sequence data will improve the ability of these statistical methods to detect changes in the form and strength of selection across the dmbx <dig> gene family. additionally, in vivo assays of protein function, as we have done, are necessary to confirm functional divergence following the gene duplication event.

discussion
the role of dmbx <dig> in regulating brain and retinal neurogenesis
our present results expand upon previous zebrafish dmbx1a knockdown experiments  <cit>  to demonstrate that the dmbx <dig> paralogs have evolved both cooperative and divergent functions in brain neurogenesis. in the midbrain, particularly in the teo, there is an independent, non-redundant requirement for both dmbx1a and dmbx1b functions, even though there is substantial overlap in progenitor cell expression of these genes. in contrast, divergent expression of the dmbx <dig> paralogs, particularly in the anterior hindbrain, correlate with divergent, paralog-specific  function in neurogenesis. we reveal for the first time that the zebrafish dmbx <dig> genes have a fundamental role in regulating either the normal pace of progenitor cell cycle progression and/or the ability to exit the cell cycle and differentiate at the appropriate time. further investigations will be required to ascertain the precise mechanism by which dmbx <dig> proteins influence cell cycle timing.

a recent study demonstrated that zic2a and zic <dig> paralogous genes are required for teo neurogenesis as early as  <dig> hpf, and that transcription of these genes is directly regulated by canonical wnt signalling  <cit> . the earlier effect of zic gene expression on tectal proliferation suggests that dmbx <dig> function may be downstream of zic. one plausible model is that zic genes promote cell cycle entry from g <dig> in cells with a normal cell cycle, while dmbx <dig> genes promote cell cycle progression or exit. given that these genes encode transcription factors, this role in cell cycle regulation could be indirect through the expression of cell cycle genes, such as cyclind <dig>  <cit>  or cdc16/ <dig> of the apc complex  <cit> , but direct regulation of cell cycle proteins is also possible. our preliminary yeast-2-hybrid analysis recovered zic2b as a putative interacting partner with dmbx1a, among other proteins with known functions in cell cycle regulation . thus, it is possible that dmbx <dig> genes, zic genes and other cell cycle regulators physically interact in a protein complex to regulate transcription and/or other functions. our data is consistent with the function of other vertebrate paired-like homeodomain transcription factors, such as chx <dig>  and prox <dig>  which have been shown to play an important role in retinal progenitor cell cycle and differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, a putative drosophila ortholog pph13/mu, which is expressed in photoreceptor cells, has been shown to be required for differentiation and function, but not retinal progenitor cell specification  <cit> . one appealing model is that canonical cell cycle inhibitors interact with dmbx <dig> and other factors to activate transcription of genes that promote cell differentiation and/or to repress genes that maintain a progenitor cell state.

patterning and early morphogenesis of the midbrain, prior to neurogenesis, requires the establishment of organizing boundaries at the rostral extent  and caudal extent  of the midbrain territory. otx <dig> and gbx <dig> are two early expressing genes that pattern the neural plate rostrocaudally  <cit>  and the interface of the two expression domains gives rise to the mhb, an organizer that activates a cascade of downstream transcriptional regulators, such as pou <dig>  pax2a, pax5/ <dig>  and eng2/ <dig>  through fgf <dig> signalling  <cit> . the dmb is established by the mutual repression of the forebrain marker pax <dig> and midbrain marker eng <dig>  <cit> . consistent with previous loss of function data in both zebrafish  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> , neither dmbx1a nor dmbx1b is essential for mhb or dmb formation. indeed, although the overall size of the midbrain territory is reduced, the expression of dmbx1a, dmbx1b, otx <dig> and wnt <dig> are normally regionalized in the double morphant embryos, indicating that dmbx <dig> is not essential for brain patterning, but is instead an important regulator for subsequent neurogenesis.

zebrafish dmbx1a and dmbx1b are both required for foxb <dig>  expression in the midbrain and hindbrain. although we have not determined whether this interaction is direct via transcriptional regulation of the foxb <dig>  gene, this data suggests that the function of dmbx <dig> may be mediated through foxb <dig> . dmbx <dig> has previously been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> , therefore it is possible that the mechanism for regulating foxb <dig>  expression may involve an indirect de-repression mechanism. interestingly, the relationship between the dmbx <dig> and foxb <dig> orthologs in mouse is different. in mouse, a null mutation in the orthologous foxb <dig> gene affects midbrain neurogenesis, particularly within the inferior colliculus, which is most notable in the postnatal period with little or no effect on the development of the superior colliculus   <cit> . in contrast, there is no discernable embryonic or postnatal defect in the dmbx <dig> null midbrain and there is no change in foxb <dig> gene expression in the dmbx <dig> null embryos  <cit> . this is strikingly different from our observations that single knockdowns of either dmbx1a or dmbx1b causes a significant growth and differentiation defect in the midbrain, which is strongly correlated with a significant reduction in foxb <dig>  gene expression. these observations lead us to speculate that there is post-duplication evolutionary divergence of function in teleosts in which dmbx <dig> genes have a more prominent role in regulating neurogenesis compared to other vertebrate classes that harbour a single dmbx <dig> gene, possibly through the novel regulation of foxb <dig> genes. however, we cannot yet rule out that other components regulating neurogenesis in mice may have been functionally compensating in the dmbx1knockout, and hence masking a phenotype that would otherwise resemble the zebrafish dmbx <dig> knockdown phenotype. post-duplication functional divergence has also been proposed for the zebrafish midkine genes  <cit> , and so it would be interesting to compare their functional evolution with that of the dmbx <dig> genes to determine if similar underlying mechanisms have evolved.

the dmbx <dig> loss of function phenotype in the retina  resembles the disarrayed  <cit>  and caf-1b  <cit>  mutants, where both cell cycle progression and/or exit, and differentiation, are significantly delayed during retinal development. however, in both of these mutants there is a substantial increase in apoptosis between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf , or  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf . interestingly, rescue of apoptosis with a p <dig> morpholino did not rescue the differentiation defect in the caf-1b mutants  <cit> , consistent with the possibility that a delayed cell cycle defect  prevents differentiation, similar to what we observe in dmbx <dig> morphants. in contrast, we did not observe persistent cell death in the brain or retina after  <dig> hpf in the dmbx <dig> morphants. nonetheless, it would be interesting to further characterize the network of genes that regulate the transition from a proliferating progenitor cell to a post-mitotic progenitor, for which disarrayed, caf-1b and dmbx <dig> genes may be required.

dmbx <dig> appears to have an essential role in the differentiation of the rod and cone photoreceptor lineages. interestingly, double morphant embryos had enhanced expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene neurod. it has been recently shown that neurod expression marks early progenitor cells within the inl that predominately give rise to rod  precursor cells that express crx and traverse the onl to eventually differentiate into mature photoreceptors  <cit> . both dmbx <dig> paralogs are expressed in the inl during photoreceptor lineage development, like neurod <dig> and crx  <cit> . however, dmbx <dig> expression does not appear to overlap with neurod <dig> and crx in the onl. thus, we speculate that dmbx <dig> functions in parallel  of neurod and crx in regulating photoreceptor progenitor cell cycle exit and/or the onset of photoreceptor differentiation.

the evolution of vertebrate dmbx <dig> genes
studies in zebrafish are increasingly playing an important role in deciphering the functional consequences of gene duplication. in this regard, significant insight into the fundamental changes in brain development that are due to the retention of duplicate genes in zebrafish comes from studies of the dlx gene family  <cit> , hoxb genes  <cit> , the zic gene family  <cit>  and pax <dig>  <cit> . in most cases, redundancy or subfunctionalization is reported to play an important role in the retention of duplicate genes. however, these mechanisms may not result in substantial genomic novelty to account for the developmental specializations during vertebrate neural evolution  <cit> . additional mechanisms for duplicate gene retention, such as neofunctionalization  <cit>  or function shuffling  <cit>  may have evolved, and may or may not be operating on different gene duplicates within a single genome  <cit> . therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the function of individual genes of a duplicate pair will have subtle and complex roles in brain development.

the dmbx <dig> gene is also conserved in the amphioxus and ascidian genomes, but is either not expressed in the nervous system during development  or is expressed in a domain that is posterior to the developing sensory vesicle and neck  region of the neural tube starting at approximately tailbud stage in ascidians  <cit> . these observations indicate that the dmbx <dig> neural expression domain in invertebrate chordates is likely to be homologous to part of the vertebrate hindbrain domain, consistent with the notion that a true midbrain region is absent in these species  <cit> . thus, dmbx <dig> expression in a region that is anterior to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  demarcates a distinct midbrain territory hypothesized to be a derived anatomical trait that evolved specifically in vertebrates.

our findings suggest zebrafish dmbx <dig> is required for proper cell cycle progression or exit and cell differentiation of progenitor cells in the brain and retina. furthermore, several observations, including:  the differences in gene expression pattern,  loss of function phenotypes,  lack of complete interchangeable function in rescue experiments, and  the changes in selective constraints in protein sequence evolution, suggest that the post-duplication zebrafish dmbx <dig> genes may have evolved a diverged function during neural development.

since our present study primarily focused at the level of cell/tissue/development for our analyses, further studies are required to resolve whether changes at the amino acid level have direct consequences for protein function. a recent analysis of the statistical methods used to determine positive selection in protein coding sequences questions the reliability of some models, such as the branch-site model not used in our analyses, in their ability to predict positively selected sites and suggests that experimental confirmation would be necessary in such analyses  <cit> . our evidence of positive selection in the teleost dmbx <dig> coding sequences is consistent with the differences in functionality between zebrafish and mouse dmbx <dig> that we observed in our morphant rescue experiments. does this evidence support the possibility for neofunctionalization  <cit> ? it is tempting, but premature to answer this question in the affirmative. in order to substantiate such a model we need to understand the function of the dmbx <dig> proteins in various vertebrate species in much more detail in order to deduce which evolutionary mechanism could plausibly explain the retention of the dmbx <dig> paralogs in the teleost genome. nonetheless, our data provide a reasonable basis to further investigate this problem experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS
there are four main observations from our study of the functional role of dmbx <dig> duplicate genes in zebrafish development. first, both dmbx1a and dmbx1b are independently required, and hence cooperate in regulating neurogenesis in the midbrain. second, dmbx1a has a predominant role in regulating neurogenesis in the retina and anterior hindbrain, and is therefore partially functionally diverged from dmbx1b. third, the cellular mechanism of zebrafish dmbx <dig> function is to control cell cycle exit and/or differentiation in progenitor cells. finally, we provide evidence for post-duplication positive selection in teleost dmbx <dig> genes that correlate with differences in over expression/rescue phenotypes between the zebrafish and mouse dmbx <dig> genes. therefore, zebrafish dmbx <dig> duplicate genes may be functionally diverged and appear to have an important role in regulating the transition from a proliferating progenitor cell to a post-mitotic differentiated neural cell.
