BACKGROUND
disease resistance  genes that mediate race-specific resistance are important for plants in defending themselves from various pathogen attacks. currently, many r genes have been characterized and most of them encode proteins sharing common features. the most prevalent domain of characterized r proteins is the leucine-rich repeat , which is the major determinant of pathogen recognition  <cit> . a relatively large number of lrr-containing r proteins belong to the nucleotide-binding site-lrr class  <cit> ; most of the characterized r genes against magnaporthe oryzae, which causes rice fungal blast, belong to this class  <cit> . the second class is the lrr receptor-like r proteins that consist of an extracellular lrr domain and a transmembrane motif  <cit> ; no rice r gene of this class has been characterized so far. the last class includes the lrr receptor kinase-like r proteins, which are only identified in rice so far  <cit> . both lrr and kinase domain are common structures in many signaling pathways. plants have a large number of lrr receptor kinase-like proteins  <cit> . all the lrr receptor kinase-like proteins contain a transmembrane motif, which departs the lrr domain to stay outside of the plasma  <cit> . thus, as cell surface receptors, the lrr receptor kinase-like proteins are thought to recognize special extracellular ligands via the lrr domain and initiate the downstream signaling through the intracellular kinase domain.

rice r gene xa3/xa <dig> confers race-specific resistance to xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  that causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide and it encodes a lrr receptor kinase-like protein  <cit> . xa3/xa <dig> belongs to a tandem clustered multiple gene family in the long arm of rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . point mutations with positive selection were a major force of the evolution of this family  <cit> . both paralogs  and orthologs  of this family have similar tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting that they may have similar functions  <cit> . in addition, at least some paralogs of this family have dosage effects, in which their disease resistance functions are associated with their transcript amounts  <cit> . the expression of xa3/xa <dig> is developmentally regulated. it has a lower level of expression at the early developmental stage, but a higher level of expression at the late developmental stage, which results in rice plants carrying xa3/xa <dig> being susceptible to some xoo strains at the seedling stage but showing enhanced resistance to the same xoo strains at the adult stages  <cit> . rice plants constitutively overexpressing xa3/xa <dig> have an enlarged resistance spectrum, an increased level of resistance, and a whole growth-stage resistance without influencing their morphologies and agronomic performance  <cit> . in addition, the ortholog alleles at xa3/xa <dig> locus confer a durable resistance to xoo  <cit> . another paralog of the xa3/xa <dig> family, the mrka, could not mediate resistance to xoo when regulated by its native promoter, but mrka could confer partial resistance to xoo when regulated by a strong constitutive promoter  <cit> .

to ascertain the functions of other paralogs of the xa3/xa <dig> family, we constitutively expressed two orthologs of this family, nrke and 9rke, from two rice varieties, at the rke locus. this pair of orthologs cannot mediate resistance to xoo as do their paralogs xa3/xa <dig> and mrka in the present experimental condition. however, they are involved in rice response to raised temperature.

methods
plasmid construction and rice transformation
to overexpress 9rke and nrke in rice, these two genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction  primers nrke-f and nrke-r  and genomic dna from indica rice variety 93- <dig>  and bacterial artificial clone  osjnba0004o <dig> from japonica variety nipponbare  as template, respectively. the pcr products were digested with bamhi and ligated into the transformation vector pu <dig>  which contained a maize ubiquitin gene promoter to drive the inserted gene  <cit> .

to study the function of different domains of nrke, two mutations of nrke were generated. the kinase domain-deleted nrke, the nrke-Δk, was created by pcr amplification using primers nrke-f and b+e- <dig> and the lrr-transmembrane motif-deleted nrke, the nrke-k, was created by pcr amplification using primers rke-6f and nrke-r . both truncated genes were amplified using nipponbare bac osjnba0004o <dig> as template. the pcr products then were ligated into pu <dig> under the regulation of maize ubiquitin gene promoter. two chimeric genes, be <dig> and be <dig>  which consist of different fragments of nrke and xa3/xa <dig>  were amplified by overlap extension pcr  <cit> . pcr primers mkb-f, b+e- <dig>  b+e- <dig>  and nrke-r were used for construction of be <dig> and primers nrke-f, b+e- <dig>  b+e- <dig>  and mkb-r were used for construction of be <dig> . both chimeric genes were amplified using bac 3h <dig>  which harbors xa3/xa <dig>  from rice variety minghui  <dig>  and nipponbare bac osjnba0004o <dig> as templates. the pcr products were ligated into pu <dig> under the regulation of maize ubiquitin gene promoter.

all the constructs were respectively transferred into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain eha <dig> by electroporation. rice transformation was performed by the agrobacterium-mediated method using calli generated from mature embryos of rice variety mudanjiang  <dig>   <cit> .

pathogen inoculation
plants were inoculated with philippine xoo strains pxo <dig>  pxo <dig>  pxo <dig>  and pxo <dig> by the leaf-clipping method at the booting  stage  <cit> . disease was scored by measuring the percentage disease area  at  <dig> weeks after inoculation.

temperature treatment
rice plants grown in a greenhouse at approximately 24°c were transferred to growth chambers for temperature experiments at the tillering stage. the growth chamber conditions were controlled as 70% humidity, 14-h light, and 10-h dark at either 24°c or 35°c. for heat shock, transgenic and wild-type plants were grown in the same pots and transferred to a 42°c growth chamber for  <dig> h . the plants were then recovered by maintaining them at room temperature for  <dig> d and phenotypes were recorded.

gene expression analyses
rna gel blot analysis was performed as described previously  <cit> . a 343-bp probe for both nrke and 9rke, digested using bamhi and saci from the pcr product amplified using primers nrke-f and nrke-r , was used for hybridization. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  was performed using gene-specific primers , as described previously  <cit> . the expression of actin gene was first used to standardize the rna sample for each qrt-pcr. for each gene, qrt-pcr assays were repeated at least twice, with each repetition having three replicates. only the results in one repetition were presented when similar results were obtained in repeated experiments. the level of expression relative to control was presented.

promoter sequence analysis
the putative cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of nrke and 9rke were predicted at plantcare http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ and place http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/place/ databases.

RESULTS
overexpression of rke resulted in the formation of lesion mimics in rice plants
the paralog rke of the r gene xa3/xa <dig> family only exists in some rice varieties  <cit> . the rke genes in rice varieties 93- <dig> and nipponbare, named 9rke  and nrke , respectively, had  <dig> % sequence identity. both genes putatively encode proteins consisting of  <dig> amino acids but with a five-residue difference .

at least some paralogs of the xa3/xa <dig> family have dosage effects in rice-bacterium interactions  <cit> . to ascertain whether nrke and 9rke also functioned in rice disease resistance, we constitutively overexpressed them in susceptible rice variety mudanjiang  <dig>  in which rke was not detected. twenty-two and  <dig> independent transformants transformed with nrke and 9rke and named nrke-oe and 9rke-oe were obtained, respectively. some of the t <dig> plants showed overexpression of nrke or 9rke . all the t <dig> plants were inoculated with xoo strain pxo <dig> at the booting stage and all the plants were susceptible as the wild-type mudanjiang  <dig>  after all the t <dig> plants were cut at about  <dig> cm above ground level after seeds had been harvested, the regenerated plants from the stubs were inoculated with other xoo strains pxo <dig>  pxo <dig>  or pxo <dig>  the transgenic plants were susceptible to these xoo strains as the wild-type plants. two independent t <dig> families generated from two t <dig> plants that overexpressed nrke were inoculated with xoo strain pxo <dig> for further analysis, but both families showed no difference from wild-type mudanjiang  <dig>  these results suggest that nrke and 9rke may not have roles in rice-xoo interaction.

interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> nrke-oe t <dig> plants and  <dig> of the  <dig> 9rke-oe t <dig> plants developed similar brown lesion mimics  on leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and peduncles of panicles at the adult stage . the lesion mimics could appear at any growth stage as small ones and developed to large ones during plant growth, but were restricted to an area around the initiation point. the lesion also could be formed spontaneously when the transgenic plants were grown in a sterilized tube or flask . these results suggest that the formation of lesions is not related to pathogen infection.

staining the leaves of the transgenic plants with visible lesion mimics using trypan blue, an indicator of dead cells  <cit> , showed dark blue-stained spots at the sites around lesion mimics; such dark blue spots were not observed in the leaves of wild-type plants . autofluorescence, an indicator of phenolic compounds produced during cell death of hypersensitive response  <cit> , was also detected at the sites of lesion mimics in the leaves of transgenic plants under the microscope after ultraviolet stimulation; no autofluorescence was detected in the leaves of wild-type plants . the leaves with visible lesion mimics were also stained with  <dig> -diaminobenzidin and nitro blue tetrazolium, the indicators of h2o <dig> and superoxides, respectively  <cit> . the leaves of the transgenic plants showed markedly increased dark staining at the sites of lesion mimics as compared to the leaves of wild-type plants after both  <dig> -diaminobenzidin and nitro blue tetrazolium staining, indicating the accumulation of h2o <dig> and superoxides in the transgenic plants . these results suggest that the lesions of the nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants were related to cell death, which may be associated with the accumulation of superoxides including h2o <dig>  because the nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants developed similar lesion mimics, only the nrke-oe plants were used for some of the further analyses.

to determine whether the development of lesion mimics was due to overexpressed nrke, two t <dig> families  derived from two of the t <dig> plants that developed lesion mimics were further examined for their phenotypes and the existence of nrke-oe construct. the development of lesion mimics on the leaves cosegregated with the existence of nrke in the two families . these results suggest that overexpressing nrke caused the formation of spontaneous lesion mimics in rice.

formation of lesion mimics in nrke-oe plants was temperature sensitive
lesion mimic formation is a complex physiologic reaction in plants and may be caused by many biotic or abiotic factors. because the nrke-oe plants appeared not to be involved in rice-xoo interaction, the formation of lesion mimics in these plants may be influenced by other environmental factors. actually, two batches of nrke-oe plants were generated in our experiments. the first batch of transgenic plants was planted in the field in early summer and marked lesion mimics were observed on their leaves when the plants grew to the booting stage during the summer. the second batch of transgenic plants was generated about  <dig> d later and was planted in the field in late summer. when the second batch of plants grew to the booting stage in the autumn, no obvious lesion mimic was observed in these plants. but after the second batch of plants was transferred to a greenhouse that had a higher temperature than the field condition, marked lesion mimics were formed on their leaves. these observations led us to infer that temperature may influence the formation of lesion mimics.

to test this inference, two identical sets of plants, including nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants, wild-type mudanjiang  <dig>  and rice varieties nipponbare  and 93- <dig>  in each set, were grown in different temperatures at the tillering stage. the two sets of plants were first grown at 24°c and 35°c, respectively, for  <dig> to  <dig> d. all the plants grown at 24°c were free of lesion mimics. for the set of plants grown at 35°c, the nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants formed marked lesion mimics on their leaves at  <dig> and  <dig> d after being at 35°c, respectively, whereas the control mudanjiang  <dig>  nipponbare, and 93- <dig> were free of lesions . when the 24°c-pretreated nrke-oe and control plants were transferred to 35°c, the transgenic plants but not control plants developed lesion mimics on their leaves even at  <dig> d after growing in 35°c . these results suggest that higher temperature may induce the formation of lesion mimics in nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants.

temperature influenced the expression of nrke and 9rke
to ascertain whether temperature transcriptionally influenced nrke and 9rke, we comparatively analyzed the expression of nrke and 9rke in wild-type plants at different temperatures. at 35°c, the expression of nrke and 9rke was markedly induced at  <dig> h after temperature treatment and then returned to the basal level of expression at  <dig> d after temperature treatment; the transcripts increased approximately 2- to  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h after 35°c treatment compared to untreated control plants . raising the temperature to 42°c further increased the expression of nrke and 9rke; the transcripts of nrke and 9rke increased approximately 30- and 7-fold at  <dig> h after treatment, respectively. however, nrke and 9rke expression was only slightly induced when the plants were kept at 24°c.

the promoter regions  of nrke and 9rke had 98% sequence identity. the two sequences were analyzed for putative cis-acting elements involved in heat stress response by searching different databases. the most canonical heat shock element  consists of a repeated core sequence of ngaan  in alternate orientation  <cit> . in the promoter regions of nrke and 9rke, two imperfect ngaan repeats were identified. the first ngaan repeat was 'actcaattcaggaat' for nkre and 'actcaattcaggata' for 9rke, and the second was 'agaatggagaactccataaatctca' for both genes . the promoter regions of the two genes also harbored another putative hse, which was complementary to the hse 'aaaaaatttc' of brassica oleracea . four ccaat boxes were also identified in the promoter regions . the ccaat box has been reported to act cooperatively with hses to increase promoter activity  <cit> . the occurrence of putative heat-responsive cis-elements and heat-induced expression suggest that nrke and 9rke may function in early response to increased temperature.

activation of nrke and 9rke expression influenced rice response to increased temperature
to examine the inference that nrke and 9rke are involved in rice response to increased temperature, nrke-oe or 9rke-oe plants and their wild-type plants were treated at 42°c. after treatment, the nrke-oe and 9rke-oe plants appeared to be more sensitive to the heat shock than their corresponding wild-type plants . the transgenic plants showed lower survival rates compared to wild-type plants. these results further suggest that rke orthologs influence rice response to temperature.

the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig> could replace the kinase domain of nrke for promoting lesion mimics
nrke putatively encodes a receptor kinase-type protein consisting of two domains, a lrr domain and a kinase domain, which are connected by a transmembrane motif. usually, the two domains function together in a complicated way in signal transduction. one exception is rice xa21d, which is a truncated form of the lrr receptor kinase xa <dig> conferring resistance to xoo. xa21d has only the lrr domain of xa <dig>  but functions similarly as xa <dig> in rice-xoo interactions  <cit> . to analyze the relationship of different domains of nrke, two truncated nrke fragments were, respectively, overexpressed in rice variety mudanjiang  <dig>  one truncated nrke was nrke-Δk, which encoded protein did not have the kinase domain of nrke; another truncated nrke was nrke-k, which only encoded the kinase domain of nrke . eighteen and  <dig> independent transformants transformed with nrke-Δk and nrke-k, and named nrke-Δk-oe and nrke-k-oe, were obtained, respectively. in the same environment, nrke-oe plants developed marked lesion mimics on their leaves, but nrke-Δk-oe and nrke-k-oe plants were free of lesions . these results suggest that a complete nrke is important for the development of lesion mimics.

nrke is the paralog of the r gene xa3/xa <dig> that confers race-specific resistance against xoo in rice  <cit> . the predicted lrr and kinase domains of nrke and xa3/xa <dig> proteins share 68% and 85% sequence identity, respectively . to determine whether the lrr or kinase domain was critical for the development of lesion mimics, we constructed two chimeric genes, the be <dig> and be <dig>  using the different fragments of nrke and xa3/xa <dig>  and constitutively overexpressed them in rice variety mudanjiang  <dig>  the be <dig> consists of the sequences encoding the region in front of lrr, lrr, juxtamembrane region, and transmembrane region of xa3/xa <dig> and the sequence encoding the kinase domain of nrke; the be <dig> consists of the sequence encoding the region in front of lrr, lrr, juxtamembrane region, and transmembrane region of nrke and the sequence encoding the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig> .

eleven and  <dig> independent transformants transformed with be <dig> and be <dig>  and named be1-oe and be2-oe, were obtained, respectively. all the be1-oe plants were free of lesions as the wild-type control plants, but  <dig> of the  <dig> be2-oe plants developed lesion mimics on their leaves at the booting stage . to determine whether the development of lesion mimics was due to overexpressed be <dig>  two t <dig> families  derived from two of the t <dig> plants that developed lesion mimics were further examined for their phenotypes and the existence of be <dig> construct. the development of lesion mimics cosegregated with existence of be <dig> in the two families . these results suggest that the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig> can replace the kinase domain of nrke to induce formation of lesion mimics.

because xa3/xa <dig> mediates rice resistance against xoo, the t <dig> be1-oe and be2-oe plants were analyzed for their response to xoo. most of the t <dig> be1-oe and be2-oe plants were susceptible to xoo strain pxo <dig> as the wild type. two be1-oe t <dig> families and two be2-oe t <dig> families were further inoculated with pxo <dig>  no increased resistance or susceptibility was associated with the existence of be1-oe or be2-oe construct in these t <dig> families . these results suggest that the kinase domain of nrke cannot replace the functions of the xa3/xa <dig> kinase domain in disease resistance.

discussion
the lrr receptor kinase-like plasma membrane proteins are the largest class of receptor-like kinases in plants and this class of proteins are well-known components in signal transduction during different physiologic activities  <cit> . for example, the clavata <dig> regulates stem cell maintenance and differentiation in arabidopsis  <cit> . bri <dig> participates in the regulation of arabidopsis growth and development via brassinosteroid signaling  <cit> . rice xa3/xa <dig> and xa <dig> mediate race-specific and major disease resistance to xoo  <cit> . the rpk <dig> functions in the abscisic acid signaling pathway related to germination, growth, and stomatal closure in arabidopsis  <cit> . erecta specifies the size and shape of mature organs in arabidopsis  <cit> . a lrr receptor kinase-like gene may be associated with the resistance to heterodera glycines in soybean and the resistance to h. glycines is temperature sensitive  <cit> . the results presented here add another example that this type of protein, rice nrke and 9rke, appears to be involved in rice response to increased temperature. this inference is supported by the following evidences. first, both nrke and 9rke were transcriptionally induced by higher temperature compared to control. second, activation of this pair of orthologs resulted in rice more sensitive to high temperature.

the lrr domain of rke is critical to sense increased temperature
as receptor, the extracellular localized lrr domain of lrr receptor kinase-like protein functions to recognize and bind ligand, which includes proteins, peptides, or nonprotein components, in signal transduction  <cit> . for example, the lrr domain of bri <dig> mediates brassinosteroid signaling by interacting with brassinolide, the active form of brassinosteroids  <cit> . arabidopsis fls2-mediated immunity is initiated by binding a bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg <dig> to its lrr domain  <cit> . rice xa21-regulated race-specific disease resistance is triggered by binding a sulfated peptide secreted by xoo to its lrr domain  <cit> . constitutive expression of the orthologs in the rke locus resulted in the formation of lesion mimics, which was related to increased temperature . thus, the appearance of lesion mimics in the nrke- or 9rke-transgenic plants is a marker of rice response to raised temperature through nrke- or 9rke-initiated signaling, although the appearance of lesion mimics did not represent a physiologic condition. the lesion mimic or lesion mimic-free phenotypes of different chimeric gene-carrying plants suggest that the lrr domain of the rke protein is essential for the induction of lesion mimics . these results in turn indicate that formation of lesion mimics may be associated with the binding of temperature-associated ligand to the lrr domain.

spontaneous formation of lesion mimics in the leaves of nrke-, 9rke-, and be2-transgenic plants cultured in sterilized containers was observed during tissue culture, which suggests that the ligand bound to the lrr domains of nrke and 9rke to induce the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics was not from the changed environment. thus, we argue that the ligand may be originated in rice. when the temperature rises, the ligand appears or its concentration is increased and rke interacts with the ligand to trigger downstream reaction. however, further study is required to examine this hypothesis.

the downstream pathways of rke and xa3/xa <dig> may partially overlap
the intracellular localized kinase domain of lrr receptor kinase is the performer of transduction of the signal recognized by the lrr domain  <cit> . a previous report has revealed that a complete lrr receptor kinase-like protein including both the lrr and kinase domains in the xa3/xa <dig> family is important for conferring disease resistance; the kinase domain of a paralog in this family can partially replace the function of the kinase domain of resistance protein xa3/xa <dig> in response to xoo  <cit> . consistent with this previous report, our present results show that neither activation of the truncated nrke lacking the kinase domain  nor activation of the kinase domain of nrke  can promote the formation of lesion mimics. the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig>  can restore the function of nrke-Δk in promoting the formation of lesion mimics. however, the kinase domain of nrke could not replace the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig>  for xoo resistance. these results suggest that the kinase domain of xa3/xa <dig> could afford all the functions of kinase domain of nrke in formation of lesion mimics, but the latter could not provide the function of the former in disease resistance. thus, some components of the downstream pathways of nrke and xa3/xa <dig> may be shared.

the above inference is also supported by the fact that nrke and xa3/xa <dig> belong to a tandem clustered r gene family; some amino acid sites of lrr domains encoded by the genes in this family are subject to positive selection, whereas the kinase domains encoded by these genes are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting the functional constraint of the kinase domains in this family  <cit> . however, not all the paralogs in this family possess the ability to confer disease resistance, although they have a similar tissue-specific expression pattern  <cit> . the present results suggest that some paralogs of the r gene family may be involved in other biological processes, like nrke and 9rke.

CONCLUSIONS
the tandem repeated paralogs of a haplotype and their orthologs in different haplotypes of r gene family provide different resistance specificities and a sequence reservoir for evolutionary forces to rapidly generate new r genes  <cit> . a previous report revealed that one paralog of tomato r gene pto family, the fen, confers sensitivity to fenthion, an organophosphorous insecticide  <cit> . our results further suggest that the "defeated" r genes, like nrke and 9rke, can also be involved in responses to raised temperature in rice, in addition to serving as the structural reservoir for creating new genes.
