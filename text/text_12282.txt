BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are diverse, ancient , photosynthetic, and photoautotrophic, and it is believed that these bacteria evolved to become chloroplasts in plant cells  <cit> . cyanobacteria have at least three enzymes involved in hydrogen synthesis/metabolism:  nitrogenase which produces hydrogen as nitrogen is converted to ammonia,  uptake hydrogenase which consumes hydrogen produced by nitrogenase, and  a bi-directional hydrogenase which can both consume and produce hydrogen  <cit> . the bi-directional hydrogenase was employed here since hydrogen production via the nitrogenase requires substantially more energy from the cell  so it would be a less-energy-efficient system   <cit> .

the reversible  hydrogenase enzyme of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> produces hydrogen via the reaction 2h+ + 2e ↔ h <dig>   <cit> ; the source of the two electrons is nadh. the genes  encoding this enzyme were identified and indicate that hoxfu are iron-sulfur proteins that bind nadh  and that the large hydrogenase subunit hoxh contains six conserved sites for binding the ni-fe cofactor  <cit> . the small hydrogenase subunit hoxy may bind a  cluster  <cit> . the function of hoxe is not clear but it may be a bridging subunit in the membrane  <cit> . we chose this bacterium since it is well-characterized with the complete genome  sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> ; hence, the hydrogenase is readily cloned. transcription of hoxefuyh is regulated by the lexa transcription activator, which specifically binds to the promoter region of the hox operon  <cit> . note that the hydrogenase enzyme is sensitive to oxygen  <cit> , so the assays are performed anaerobically.

hydrogenase enzymes in e. coli are involved in two distinct modes of hydrogen metabolism: hydrogen production via hydrogenase  <dig> and hydrogen uptake by hydrogenases  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . hydrogenase  <dig> , hydrogenase  <dig> , and hydrogenase  <dig>  have nickel, iron, and three non-protein diatomic ligands  in the active site which rely on the auxiliary proteins hypabcdef  and slyd  for maturation as well as may possibly rely on the chaperones groel/groes  <cit> . hydrogenase  <dig> and hydrogenase  <dig> are αβ heterodimers of a small subunit and a ni-fe containing catalytic large subunit and are present in the inner membrane facing the periplasmic space  <cit> . in e. coli, hydrogen is produced by hydrogenase  <dig> in the formate hydrogenlyase system   <cit> . hyce encodes the large subunit of hydrogenase  <dig>  and hyca encodes the repressor gene of the fhl system including the hyc operon  <cit> . hyci protease catalyses a c-terminal proteolytic cleavage of the hyce large subunit, and hypa, hypb, hypc, hypd, hype, and hypf are required for metallocenter assembly  <cit> . ordinarily, cyanobacteria employ photosynthesis fueled by light energy to produce hydrogen. however, if an active hydrogenase from a cyanobacterium may be expressed in e. coli, it is possible to use the energy from simple sugars  to produce hydrogen. other advantages of using e. coli are that the use of energy from sugar rather than light avoids relying on the availability of light and avoids the production of oxygen as occurs during photosynthesis. oxygen as an impurity in hydrogen arising from photosynthetic activity is undesirable for fuel cells based on enzyme electrodes  <cit>  and is undesirable as a fire hazard  <cit> . hence, large production of hydrogen is more advantageous via fermentation rather than photochemical production  <cit> .

hydrogen is a 100% renewable fuel that burns cleanly, is efficient, and generates no toxic by-products  <cit> . hydrogen is also the preferred choice for fuel cells. not only is h <dig> a clean fuel, producing only water as its by-product, it actually has a higher energy content than oil , and is thus more efficient. most of the h <dig> now produced globally is by the process of steam reforming and the water-gas shift reaction, or as a by-product of petroleum refining and chemicals production  <cit> . use of biological methods of h <dig> production promises significant energy reduction costs, as these processes do not require extensive heating . here we report the cloning of an active cyanobacterial enzyme complex into e. coli to enhance hydrogen production primarily by limiting hydrogen uptake by the native e. coli hydrogenases.

RESULTS
enhanced e. coli hydrogen production by hoxefuyh
to create a recombinant system which produces hydrogen via fermentation, we cloned the hydrogenase locus  of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> into the well-studied bacterium e. coli. dna sequencing and restriction enzyme digests showed the correct locus was cloned; our plasmid was designated pbssynhox .

native e. coli tg <dig> produces hydrogen via the fhl system during mixed-acid fermentations  <cit> , and tg <dig> expressing the cyanobacterial hydrogenase produced 3-fold more hydrogen than cells which lacked the hoxefuyh locus  after  <dig> h in complex medium. more hydrogen was measured at least  <dig> times for cells expressing hoxefuyh relative to the negative control that lacks the cyanobacterial locus so the effect is reproducible. the negative controls of both autoclaved tg1/pbssynhox and autoclaved e. aerogenes hu- <dig> did not produce hydrogen. note that co-elution with pure hydrogen confirmed that hydrogen was produced by the e. coli cells and also our retention time for hydrogen was consistent with literature values   <cit> . in addition, the recombinant e. coli expressing the cyanobacterial hydrogenase produced about 2-fold more hydrogen after  <dig> h in complex medium than the positive control e. aerogenes hu- <dig> , a well-studied producer of hydrogen  <cit> . furthermore, hydrogen gas bubbles were clearly more visible in the recombinant strain compared to the host which lacked the cyanobacteria locus and also visible in the positive control but were not visible with autoclaved samples . therefore, the recombinant e. coli strain produces significantly higher quantities of hydrogen gas.

optimization of medium and time course of hydrogen production
the cyanobacterial genes were fused to a lac promoter in pbs; therefore, the expression of hoxefuyh will be suppressed by catabolite repression if glucose is included in complex medium. to search for an optimal medium for producing hydrogen, glucose was replaced with fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, glycerin, citrate, and succinate in complex medium. hydrogen production in complex medium with fructose, galactose or maltose was 20% more than that with glucose in tg1/pbssynhox whereas the other carbon sources did not improve hydrogen production.

to investigate hydrogen production with tg1/pbssynhox in more detail, a hydrogen time course experiment was performed. hydrogen produced by e. coli tg <dig> cells with or without hoxefuyh was maximum within  <dig>  h . furthermore, from  <dig>  h to  <dig> h, hydrogen produced in the absence of hoxefuyh decreased  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold more rapidly than that from cells with hoxefuyh ; hence, the hydrogen formed in the presence of hoxefuyh was more stable. this suggested that hydrogen uptake is inhibited by expression of active hoxefuyh. note that after  <dig> h, the hydrogen yield from cells expressing hoxefuyh was over  <dig> times more than that of the wild-type strain .

enhanced hydrogen production depends on native hydrogenase 3
to ascertain if elements of the native e. coli host fhl system impact the cyanobacteria hydrogenase system, hydrogenase activities of the cyanobacteria and the e. coli fhl were assayed in a series of mutants that lack either e. coli hydrogenase  <dig> of the fhl  or lack the maturation machinery required for assembling hydrogenases in e. coli . we also examined a mutant that lacked the transcriptional activator fhla, and thus would not express genes encoding the fhl complex  as well as assayed a mutant that cannot form selenoproteins  and thus is unable to produce active formate dehydrogenase h . since the parent strain mc <dig> with pbssynhox produced hydrogen but the fhl mutants  harboring pbssynhox did not produce hydrogen gas, active expression of the cyanobacteria hydrogenase system relies on both an active e. coli hydrogenase  <dig> as well as the maturation proteins of the host and cannot simply be due to hoxefuyh acting as an electron donor to hyd <dig> 

role of the cyanobacterial proteins hoxefuyh
to observe the expression of the recombinant enzymes, sds-page was performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  hoxu  from the cyanobacterium was clearly expressed in tg1/pbssynhox that produced hydrogen gas in both complex medium and lb medium while the other proteins  were not observed. as expected, hoxu was not observed in tg1/pbs . also, the expression of hoxu was greater in complex medium relative to lb medium and complex medium produced more hydrogen. hence, hoxu of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> may play a major role in the elevated hydrogen production in e. coli.

to discern if only hoxu is required for producing more hydrogen, hoxu was cloned under the lac promoter hoxu, figure 1b), and hydrogen production in tg <dig> harboring pbshoxu was examined. tg1/pbshoxu produced more hydrogen than tg1/pbs but only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of that of tg1/pbssynhox. these results indicate that the additional hydrogen produced by expressing hoxefuyh is not solely the result of active hoxu; hence, other active hoxefuyh proteins are required for producing hydrogen.

to determine the importance of the other cyanobacterial enzymes for hydrogen production, pbshoxefu , pbshoxfu , pbshoxfuy , and pbshoxuyh  were also constructed and hydrogen production in tg <dig> with these plasmids was tested. hydrogen production in tg1/pbshoxefu and tg1/pbshoxfu showed  <dig> ± 7% and  <dig> ± 2% of the hydrogen produced by tg1/pbssynhox; hence, these strains had about half the hydrogen produced by cloning either hoxefuyh or the almost same value as that by expressing only hoxu and they confirm the importance of hoxu. in contrast, tg1/pbshoxfuy and tg1/pbshoxuyh produced  <dig> ± 22% and  <dig> ± 31% of the hydrogen produced by tg1/pbssynhox, respectively; therefore, hydrogen production in tg1/pbshoxuyh was somewhat better than that in tg1/pbssynhox indicating the importance of proteins hoxu, hoxy, and hoxh.

mechanism of enhanced hydrogen production is via inhibition of hydrogen uptake
since the hydrogen time course experiment  showed the hydrogen produced by cells expressing hoxefuyh was more stable than hydrogen from cells which lacked this locus and given that the greater hydrogen production seen upon cloning the cyanobacterial locus was dependent on both the native hydrogenase maturation proteins and active hydrogenase  <dig>  we theorized that hoxefuyh may be influencing hydrogen uptake. recall that hydrogenase  <dig> and  <dig> are involved in hydrogen uptake only  <cit> . hence, hydrogen uptake activity was measured three ways to investigate this hypothesis. as shown in table  <dig>  e. coli tg <dig> expressing hoxefuyh had  <dig>  times less hydrogen uptake compared to the negative control tg1/pbs and e. coli mc <dig> had similar results. these hydrogen uptake results were corroborated by using a plate assay for reversible hydrogenase activity which showed 10-fold less hydrogen uptake upon expressing hoxefuyh and by a gc-based hydrogen up-take assay which indicated that h <dig> uptake activity in tg1/pbssynhox is  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold less than tg1/pbs over  <dig> to  <dig> h. hence, the active cyanobacterial enzymes  inhibit hydrogen uptake consistently in e. coli.

standard deviations shown from one representative experiment with  <dig> replicates. a iptg was added for hydrogen uptake  assays activity for  <dig> h in complex medium.

to determine by which of the three native e. coli hydrogenases that hydrogen uptake was affected by hoxefuyh, a series of isogenic mutants of e. coli bw <dig> was used . using two mutants for hydrogenase  <dig> , hydrogen uptake was measured and found to increase consistently 2-fold upon removing hydrogenase  <dig> in the presence of hoxefuyh; hence, hoxefuyh decreases hydrogen uptake via hydrogenase  <dig>  similarly, using two mutants for hydrogenase  <dig> , hydrogen uptake increased consistently  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold  upon removing hydrogenase  <dig> in the presence of hoxefuyh; hence, hoxefuyh decreases hydrogen uptake via hydrogenase  <dig>  in contrast, upon adding hoxefuyh, isogenic mutations that eliminate hydrogenase  <dig> activity   decreased hydrogen uptake . in addition, hydrogen uptake in the hyab hybc double mutant that eliminated hydrogenase  <dig> and  <dig> activity was identical to that of the wild-type strains expressing hoxefuyh and the expression of hoxefuyh had no effect in the double mutant . corroborating these results, hydrogen production by bw <dig> hyab hybc/pbssynhox was the same as bw <dig> hyab hybc/pbs . on the other hand, a triple mutant  with pbs or pbssynhox did not produce hydrogen , indicating that hydrogenase  <dig> is essential for producing hydrogen. therefore, hoxefuyh works through hydrogenase  <dig> and hydrogenase  <dig> rather than through hydrogenase  <dig>  and the decrease in hydrogen uptake seen with the hydrogenase  <dig> mutants is due to hoxefuyh inhibition of the remaining active hydrogenase  <dig> and  <dig> enzymes.

dna microarrays
to investigate whether cloning of the cyanobacterial hoxefuyh merely increased hydrogen production by up-regulating the native e. coli hydrogenase system, we examined differential gene expression upon expression of hoxefuyh from pbssynhox. the microarrays showed that gene expression for the hya, hyb, hyc, and hyp operons was not altered between tg1/pbssynhox and tg1/pbs; hence, functional hoxefuyh is necessary for enhanced hydrogen production in e. coli . surprisingly, the differential gene expression indicated that primarily biofilm-related genes are regulated by expressing hoxefuyh as shown in table  <dig>  to investigate the effect of expression of hoxefuyh on biofilm formation, a 96-well polystyrene plate assay was performed. e. coli tg <dig> expressing hoxefuyh produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  times more biofilm than tg1/pbs under anaerobic conditions in lb with  <dig> % glucose after  <dig> h at 37°c.

discussion
to date, no cyanobacterial hydrogenase protein has been actively expressed in e. coli. functional expression here of the cyanobacterial hydrogenase components in e. coli allows for both mutagenesis for structure/function determinations as well as for enhanced hydrogen production via saturation mutagenesis and dna shuffling  <cit> . also, e. coli cells offer two advantages over normally photosynthetic microbes regarding protein evolution. first, the transformation efficiency of e. coli  is at least three orders of magnitude greater than those of photosynthetic bacteria  <cit> . a rapid e. coli-based genetic selection method for hydrogenase activity would enable the sampling of thousands of different hydrogenase mutants in a single day. second, hydrogen production by cyanobacteria requires light, and oxygen is produced through photosynthesis; oxygen production is undesirable for fuel cells; therefore, it is more desirable to clone the hydrogenase into e. coli rather than cyanobacteria since e. coli is a facultative anaerobe.

in cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  hoxfu are iron-sulfur proteins that bind nadh   <cit> . also, hoxu is thought to serve as the bridging unit in the link between respiration and the hydrogenase  <cit> . in addition, cyanobacteria anacystis nidulans saug 1402- <dig> and anacystis sp. pcc  <dig> showed reduced hydrogen-evolution catalyzed by the bidirectional hydrogenase upon mutation of hoxu  <cit> ; these indicate that hoxu is important for hydrogenase activity. our sds-page results demonstrated that the hoxu protein  was clearly expressed in tg1/pbssynhox and that the expression of hoxu increased according to increasing hydrogen production. since only hoxu was seen with sds-page, we surmised that it may have its own promoter. corroborating this, between the stop codon of hoxf and the start codon of hoxu there is a gap of  <dig> bp that contains six putative promoters upstream of hoxu based on promoter prediction software  <cit> . the expression of hoxu is probably regulated independently by at least one of these promoters; this suggested that controlling expression of hoxu may provide significant insight for elevating hydrogen production, which proved correct since cloning only hoxu accounted for about half of the hydrogen produced by cloning hoxefuyh. this shows the other cyanobacterial proteins , although not clearly observed with sds-page, are beneficial for producing hydrogen. since expressing hoxuyh in e. coli tg <dig> yields nearly the same effect as expressing all of hoxefuyh via tg1/pbssynhox, hoxuyh are clearly important for enhanced hydrogen production.

hydrogen production was enhanced as much as 41-fold via production of the active cyanobacterial hoxefuyh, and the hydrogen produced using tg1/pbssynhox was more stable in comparison to that of tg1/pbs; this indicated that tg1/pbssynhox has reduced hydrogen uptake activity. since any mutation related to hydrogenase  <dig> eliminated the benefit of expressing the cyanobacterial hydrogenase, it is clear that hydrogenase  <dig> is necessary for the hoxefuyh effect since only hydrogenase  <dig> produces hydrogen in e. coli whereas hoxefuyh maintains this hydrogen that is produced by limiting hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase  <dig> and  <dig>  in accordance with this interpretation, hydrogen uptake was found to be  <dig> to  <dig> times lower upon expression of hoxefuyh. also, the microarray analysis shows that native hydrogenase gene expression is not affected by enhanced hydrogen production with tg1/pbssynhox, so there are no transcriptional effects related to cloning hoxefuyh. taken together, these results show expression of hoxefuyh increases hydrogen production by reducing hydrogen uptake of the native e. coli hydrogenases, but hydrogenase  <dig> is required to produce the hydrogen in the first place. note that hydrogenase  <dig> and  <dig> have hydrogen uptake activity  <cit> , and hydrogenase  <dig> has hydrogen production activity 

in contrast to the native hydrogenase gene expression, the dna microarrays indicated the expression of many biofilm-related genes were altered upon expression of hoxefuyh , and this altered expression led to an increase in biofilm formation. interestingly, our study of temporal gene expression in e. coli k- <dig> biofilms  <cit>  shows that the genes related to hydrogenase  <dig>  and to hydrogenase  <dig>  are transiently repressed, that the genes related to hydrogenase  <dig>  and hydrogenase  <dig>  are up-regulated in the process of biofilm formation, and that some hya or hyf mutants produce 3- to 7-fold more biofilm. so the fact that expression of hoxefuyh affects biofilm genes  and that hydrogenase genes are routinely found in biofilm studies  <cit>  suggest that biofilm formation is related to enhanced hydrogen production. hence, it appears that biofilm formation may repress hydrogen uptake activity or induce hydrogen production, either of which would result in enhanced hydrogen production. in the future, we will need to ascertain whether biofilm formation is directly related to enhanced hydrogen production and how hoxefuyh represses hydrogen uptake activity in e. coli.

to the best of our knowledge, on a protein basis, citrobacter sp. y <dig>   <cit> , rhodopseudomonas palustris ja <dig>   <cit> , rhodopseudomonas palustris p <dig>   <cit> , and klebsiella oxytoca hp <dig>   <cit>  all have higher maximum hydrogen activity compared to our tg1/pbssynhox recombinant ; however, these organisms are more fastidious than e. coli. therefore, e. coli holds promise for producing hydrogen as a more robust model host for heterologous expression of hydrogenases. along these lines, yoshida et al.  <cit>  recently increased native hydrogenase expression in e. coli by inactivating the hyca fhl repressor and by overexpressing the fhla transcriptional activator for the hyc and hyp operons with the result that  <dig> -fold more hydrogen was generated . this approach suggests similar genetic changes  may be used to increase further hydrogen production using both the native and cyanobacterial hydrogenases.

CONCLUSIONS
e. coli tg <dig> cells with pbssynhox yielded  <dig> times more hydrogen after  <dig> h than those with empty vector pbs due to active hoxefuyh from synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> . the mechanism for this enhanced hydrogen production is that hydrogen is formed first by hydrogenase  <dig> , then hoxefuyh inhibits hydrogen uptake by e. coli native hydrogenase  <dig> and hydrogenase  <dig>  in effect, a novel way to reduce reversible hydrogen formation has been discovered using a cyanobacterial locus.
