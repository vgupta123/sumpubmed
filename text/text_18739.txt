BACKGROUND
drug delivery to the brain is mediated by several factors, most notably transport across the blood brain  and the choroid plexus barrier; the latter displays drug-metabolizing enzyme and drug transport activity. it may therefore determine the overall cerebral bioavailability of drugs  <cit> . specifically, the choroid plexus is located within brain vesicles. it is composed of a tight monolayer of polarized epithelial cells and forms the blood-cerebrospinal-fluid  barrier. together with the blood-brain barrier, formed by endothelial cells of brain capillaries, it functions as the main interface between the central nervous system  and the peripheral circulation. within the cns this tissue is of great pharmacological interest, but information on the expression of efflux transporters such as the atp binding cassette  proteins is missing  <cit> . in contrast, their expression in liver, kidney, and intestine has been studied in considerable detail  <cit> . indeed, the abc drug transporters extrude a variety of structurally diverse drugs, drug conjugates and metabolites in an active, atp-dependent manner and even against high concentration gradients. the three main abc families considered to be involved in the disposition of xenobiotics include the abcb family , the abcc family of multidrug resistance proteins , and the breast cancer resistance protein  of the abcg family  <cit> . however, comprehensive studies on the expression levels of atp transporters in the human choroid plexus have not been attempted.

notably, there is clear evidence for hnf4α to play a role in the transcriptional control of drug transporters. specifically, hnf4α is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and one of the key players in liver biology  <cit> . among the genes regulated by hnf4α are a broad range of xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome p <dig> isozymes  <cit> , udp-glucuronosyltransferases  <cit> , sulfotransferases  <cit>  and transporters including organic anion transporter  <dig>  <cit> , organic cation transporter  <dig>  <cit> , the abc transporter abcc <dig>  <cit> , abcc <dig>  <cit> , abcg <dig>  <cit>  and abcg <dig>  <cit> . although there is clear evidence for hnf4α to be of key importance in the control of drug metabolism it may also play a role in the regulation of transporters in the choroid plexus. here we report our efforts in mapping hnf4α to human and rat choroid plexus. we determined hnf4α dna binding activity and searched for transcript expression of various abcb and abcc transporters in the human choroid plexus. apart from qrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry studies we evidence abcc <dig> gene expression to be highly dependent on hnf4α as determined in functional knock down studies. overall, we provide evidence for hnf4α to be an important regulator of abc drug transporters in the choroid plexus and thus may impact efficacy of pharmacotherapy targeted to the brain.

RESULTS
initially, we searched for hnf4α transcripts in individual samples of human and rat choroid plexus and confirmed gene expression of hnf4α by quantitative real time rt-pcr . we found hnf4α transcript expression in human and rat choroid plexus to account for approximately a tenth of its expression in the liver . it is of considerable importance that hnf4α expression in the human and rat choroid plexus is restricted to p <dig> promoter driven isoforms . furthermore, we studied expression of the insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , transthyretin  and the transcription factor foxj <dig> to further qualify choroidal epithelial cells of the brain  <cit> . these transcripts are specifically enriched in choroid plexus. we observed abundant expression of igf <dig>  ttr and foxj <dig> in human choroid plexus as compared to total brain rna extracts . there is the need to study histological well qualified tissue, as studies with total brain rna extracts would render findings meaningless as will be discussed later on. unfortunately, sufficient human choroid plexus tissue suitable for the harvest of nuclear protein and to perform western blotting as well as emsa assay could not be obtained. we nonetheless demonstrate hnf4α protein expression by immunohistochemistry by use of a specific hnf4α antibody for human  and rat choroid plexus . to confirm specificity an excess of antigen preabsorbed to the antibody was used .

hnf4αp <dig> and p <dig> gene expression was measured in human and rat choroid plexus  by real-time quantitative rt-pcr and computed relative to expression of mitatpase <dig>  which served as a housekeeping gene. patient characteristics are given in table  <dig>  caco- <dig> cells and pancreatic tissue served as controls for hnf4αp <dig> expression in human and rats, respectively.

we then analyzed expression of different members of the abcb /abcc  gene families in the human choroid plexus by quantitative real time rt-pcr and report results for n =  <dig> individual human choroid plexus samples. mrna expression of abcb <dig> , abcc <dig> , abcc <dig> , abcc <dig> , abcc <dig> , abcc <dig>  and abcc <dig>  was comparable to its expression level in commercially available control total human brain rna extracts . mrna expression of abcb <dig>  determined in choroidal epithelium was lower than in human liver  and in brain .

we then searched for hnf4α binding sites in proximal promoter sequences  of drug transporter coding genes. for this purpose, we used two different bioinformatic approaches . we observed three binding sites within the abcb <dig> promoter, spaced approximately by  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp and two recognition sites within the abcc <dig> promoter . predicted binding sites were confirmed by emsa band shift assays. we used 32p-labeled double-stranded dna probes to specifically probe for hnf4α-sites located in the human abcb <dig>  and in the human abcc <dig>  gene. note, dna binding of nuclear extracts to the a-site of the hnf1α-promoter  served as a positive control. this site is an established recognition site for hnf4α. unfortunately, sufficient amount of human choroid plexus suitable for the isolation of nuclear protein could not be obtained. instead, we used nuclear extracts isolated from the human intestinal cell line caco- <dig> which expresses several abc transporter genes  <cit>  and therefore is a rich source of hnf4α nuclear protein. indeed, hnf4α protein expression in caco- <dig> cells is comparable to organs such as the liver  <cit> . as depicted in figures 3a we observed strong binding of hnf4α to the a-site of the hnf1α-promoter. we also observed strong binding of hnf4α to the predicted sites in the promoters of abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> ; bands could be shifted with a specific hnf4α antibody therefore demonstrating selectivity and specificity of the assay. alignment of human, rat and mouse abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> genes did not identify common hnf4alpha binding sites. this points to differences in the molecular organization of abc promoters in orthologous genes. hnf4alpha binding sites for the rat and mouse abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> genes are given in table  <dig>  whereas the sequences of oligonucleotides to confirm the predicted sites experimentally are shown in table  <dig>  as shown in figures 3b and 3c emsa band shift assays confirmed binding of hnf4α to rat and mouse abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> targeted sequences.

transfac matrix  or self-generated matrix  with a setting of core and matrix similarity  <dig>  was used.

the central five nucleotides of the hnf4α binding site are highlighted in bold letters. the two direct repeats  separated by a spacer of one nucleotide are underlined.

to further probe for the role of hnf4α in abc gene regulation we employed an sirna approach. specifically, sirna-mediated functional knock down of hnf4α in the human caco- <dig> cell line resulted in significantly decreased gene expression of abcc <dig> . these results confirm abcc <dig> to be a gene target of hnf4α. abcb <dig> expression in caco- <dig> cells is near the limit of detection. consequently, knockdown experiments are not meaningful.

functional knock down of hnf4α was already reported  <cit> . * a student's t test was done to compare hnf4α sirna transfection against negative sirna transfected controls. the results were considered significant when the p value was less than  <dig> . gene expression was determined by real-time quantitaive rt-pcr in triplicates; mitatpase <dig> served as housekeeping gene. the ΔΔct-method was used to determine repression of gene expression. values for hnf4α sirna transfection represent transcript abundance relative to negative sirna transfected controls, which were set to 100%.

discussion
our study aimed for a better understanding of the role of hnf4α in the regulation of drug transporters. here we present evidence for expression of hnf4α in the epithelium of the csf barrier. by applying position weight matrices to genomic sequences of abc transporters we were able to predict hnf4α binding sites in the promoters of the abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> gene. the predicted binding sites were then confirmed by emsa band shift assays. we propose a role for hnf4α in the regulation of drug transporters of the choroid plexus. notably, hnf4α is a key player in the regulation of genes coding for various metabolic pathways and of xenobiotic metabolism  <cit> . this protein also promotes expression of an epithelial phenotype  <cit> . specifically, epithelium of the choroid plexus cells is highly differentiated and functions as a blood-csf barrier. the expression of hnf4α in the epithelium of the choroid plexus and its dna binding to regulatory sequences of drug transporters is a novel finding. its expression accounts for approximately a tenth of hnf4α expression found in liver. furthermore, there is evidence for hnf4α to undergo alternative splicing with isoforms may arising from alternative splicing and/or usage of two different promoters  <cit> . specifically, the p <dig> promoter generates six different isoforms ; but activation of the p <dig> promoter results in isoforms hnf4α7-α <dig>  p <dig> promoter-driven hnf4α isoforms are expressed throughout mouse liver development, but disappear after birth, while p <dig> promoter-driven transcripts are abundantly expressed postnataly  <cit> . additionally, p <dig> isoforms are induced in mouse and human hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  and are primarily expressed in human pancreatic islets and exocrine cells  <cit> . in the case of the choroid plexus it appears that expression of hnf4α is restricted to p <dig> promoter-driven isoforms. hnf4α protein expression in human and rat choroid plexus could be clearly evidenced by immunohistochemistry. to further qualify tissue preparations of choroid plexus expression of igf <dig>  ttr and foxj <dig> was investigated; their expression are accepted genetic markers of the choroid plexus  <cit> . we validated tissue preparations by morphological and genetic markers. unlike previous studies where expression of hnf4α transcripts could not be evidenced in total rna extracts of the brain  <cit> , we were able to confirm expression of hnf4α in the choroid plexus of human and rat brain. most certainly, total brain rna extracts dilute copy number of hnf4α transcripts to presumable levels below the limit of detection. here, we evidence binding of hnf4α to regulatory sequences of drug transporters expressed in the choroid plexus and analyzed gene expression of abc transporters in patients with different causes of death, but the functional significance of the newly identified hnf4α binding sites in activating the abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> promoters still needs to be established.

in the past attempts to detect hnf4α dna binding in a choroid plexus papilloma failed  <cit> . the investigators performed emsa experiments with nuclear extracts of rat liver, kidney and intestine and of sv40-induced choroid plexus papilloma of transgenic mice, but unfortunately probed for hnf4alpha binding with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the hnf4α binding site in the mouse ttr  promoter. the authors did not employ an antibody in emsa band shift assays; instead, competition with excess of unlabeled probes was done. although the authors described a weak binding of hnf4α with nuclear extracts from kidney they considered intestine as well as choroid plexus as deficient for hnf4α binding. there is a need to consider tissue specific dna binding activity. hnf4α binding at the ttr promoter is much less as compared to the a-site in the hnf <dig> promoter . as detailed above, hnf4α gene expression in human and rat choroid plexus is approximately one tenth of its expression in the liver . it is therefore not surprising that previous investigators  <cit>  failed to detect hnf4α protein in intestine and choroid plexus, even though the authors described weak expression of this protein in kidney. by now, it is well established that hnf4α expression is not restricted to liver, but also functions in kidney and intestine  <cit> . here we evidence by immunohistochemical staining hnf4α to be expressed in epithelium of human and rat choroid plexus .

notably, the choroid plexus functions as a barrier for drug uptake to the brain. this tissue expresses drug metabolizing enzymes  and some transporters  <cit> . expression of dmes in the choroid plexus is part of a defense program to prevent entry of xenobiotics into the brain. the blood-csf barrier also regulates entry and distribution of various pharmacologically active compounds between the blood and the csf interface and is basically involved in numerous exchange processes thereby determining the supply of the brain with nutrients and hormones  <cit> . indeed, endogenous metabolites, as well as neurotransmitter and metabolites from the brain are cleared via this barrier  <cit> . in drug therapies efflux transporters of the abc-family are of pivotal importance in determining therapeutic tissue levels. in the past research focused on their regulation in liver, kidney and intestine  <cit> . the knowledge on drug transporter in specialized tissues of the brain is incomplete. specifically, abcb  proteins accept a broad range of substrates and may transport large lipophilic, neutral or cationic compounds. this includes a vast number of neuropharmacological drugs such as antiepileptic and antiviral drugs, antidepressants, opiods, antipsychotics and tranquilizer  <cit> . abcb <dig>  a transporter with highest expression in the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> , is expressed at low levels in human choroid plexus, that is much lower than in liver and total brain. our findings are consistent with results reported previously for rats  <cit> . its apical expression in rat, mouse and human choroidal epithelium was shown previously  <cit> . furthermore, abcb <dig> is highly expressed in the liver, where it is acting as a "flippase" in transporting phospholipids into the bile, but abcb <dig> can also bind and transport a subset of abcb <dig> substrates with an overlap in substrate specificity  <cit> . as reported for abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> is expressed at low levels in human choroid plexus, i.e. more than  <dig> fold lower than in liver. low abcb <dig> expression was also evidenced in choroidal epithelium of the rat  <cit> , but to the best of our knowledge our study is the first report on expression in human choroid plexus. an apical distribution of abcb <dig> in neonatal cultured rat choroid plexus cells imply a drug transport from blood into csf  <cit> . in endothelial cells of small blood capillaries of the blood-brain barrier, apical located abcb <dig> pumps drugs back into the blood stream and therefore limits drug penetration to the brain  <cit> .

likewise, the abcc  proteins are multispecific organic anion transporters and accept glucurono-, glutathione- and sulfo-conjugates. they transport physiological substrate conjugates as well as drug conjugates. expression of abcc1- <dig> mrna transcripts was reported for rat choroid plexus  <cit>  as was expression of abcc <dig> for human choroid plexus  <cit> . abcc <dig>  abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> were expressed in human choroid plexus at least at  <dig> fold higher than in liver; whereas abcc <dig>  abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> were expressed up to  <dig> fold lower than liver. similar results were reported for abcc transporter expression in rat choroid plexus  <cit> . notably, abcc <dig> is localized at the basolateral membrane of choroid plexus  <cit> , but gazzin et al  <cit>  described a major difference in the localization of abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> proteins between the blood-brain and the blood-csf barrier with strongest expression of abcc <dig> at the choroidal epithelium. indeed, abcc proteins contribute to the protective role of the choroid plexus and mediate basolateral efflux of conjugates resulting from choroidal drug metabolism into the blood. although it is known that the choroid plexus is important in regulating the distribution of various pharmacologically active compounds between the blood and the csf, the characterization of the involved human abc transporters gives new insights into the function of the csf barrier.

furthermore, abcbs  and abccs  are inducible transporters and are highly responsive to chemotherapeutics, carcinogens, inflammation, heat shock, hypoxia and irradiation  <cit> . they are regulated by a complex network of transcriptional cascades, such as by multiple ligand activated nuclear receptors like retinoid x receptor , farnesoid x receptor , constitutive androstane receptor  and the xenobiotic receptor pregnane x receptor   <cit> . there is also evidence for the transcription factors ap- <dig>  p <dig>  egr- <dig> and wt- <dig> to participate in their regulation with nf-y, sp <dig> and sp <dig> being involved in the constitutive expression  <cit> . recently, an upregulation of abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> transcripts was reported in human embryonic kidney cells that conditionally expressed wild-type hnf4α  <cit> . an important role of hnf4α in the transcriptional control of drug transporters was reported for human hepatocytes as determined by adenoviral hnf4α-sirna mediated knockdown  <cit> . we also employed an sirna mediated functional knockdown of hnf4α and found abcc <dig> gene expression to be massively repressed. there is a need to improve an understanding of the mechanism by which transporters are regulated. this will impact the design of novel cns therapeutics. targeting transporters may thus be useful in achieving therapeutic tissue levels of cns drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
we report expression of hnf4α in choroid plexus of the human and rat brain. this factor might regulate expression of some atp binding cassette transporters. targeting of hnf4α may impact efficacy of pharmacotherapy of cns drugs.
