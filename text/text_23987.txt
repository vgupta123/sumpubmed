BACKGROUND
channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus, is the major aquaculture species in the united states, accounting for over 60% of all u.s. aquaculture production. channel catfish is regarded as one of the best characterized species serving as a model for teleost immune studies  <cit> , and an important model species for study of toxicology and reproductive physiology  <cit> . the channel catfish genome is estimated to be  <dig> gb in size http://www.genomesize.com and is highly at-rich, with  <dig> % a+t  <cit> . the catfish genome contains one main type of tandem repeats named as xba elements  <cit>  and several types of dispersed repetitive elements with the mariner/tc <dig> dna transposons as the leading type of dispersed repetitive elements , followed by retrotransposons , mermaid, merman, and other sine elements , lines  and various types of short sequence repeats such as microsatellites   <cit> .

at present, a number of genomic tools and resources have been developed in catfish, including bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries  <cit> , bac-based physical maps  <cit> , genetic linkage maps  <cit> , a large number of ests  <cit> , over  <dig> unique full length cdnas  <cit> , over  <dig>  bac end sequences  <cit> , and a large number of identified molecular markers such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> . whole genome sequencing of catfish is underway, and this project was conducted as a pilot study to define the parameters important for the generation of the whole genome sequence assembly.

a major limitation of eukaryotic genome sequencing is the costs involved in sequencing. in recent years, however, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed drastic reduction in sequencing costs. among many sequencing platforms, the second generation of sequencing technologies such as  <dig> sequencing, illumina sequencing, and solid sequencing are the most commonly used sequencing platforms. a common feature of these sequencers is their relatively short sequencing reads, making subsequent sequence assembly a great challenge. such challenges become even more significant when dealing with large and complex eukaryotic genomes. teleost genome, known to have gone through a third round of whole genome duplication  <cit> , poses additional challenge when coupled with the short sequencing reads. in consideration of such complexities, quinn et al.  <cit>  conducted a pilot study with eight pooled bac clones covering approximately  <dig> mb of the atlantic salmon genome with  <dig> gs flx pyrosequencing, and concluded that it was difficult to achieve good levels of genome sequence assembly with  <dig> sequencing with the tetraploid genome. however, with the diploid european sea bass, kuhl et al.  <cit>  was able to generate large superscaffolds  with 17-39x coverage of pooled bacs using pyrosequencing. apparently, genome complexity as well as existing genome resources can influence the outcomes of assembly of sequences generated from next generation sequencing. in this study, based on the existing catfish bac-based physical map,  <dig> pooled bac clones covering around  <dig> mb catfish genome were sequenced by using both pyrosequencing and illumina sequencing technologies. in addition with the existing bac end sequences, we aim to take full advantages of multiple sequencing technologies and existing genetic resources for the upcoming catfish whole genome sequencing.

several de novo assembly software packages have been developed for assembling genome sequences generated from the next-generation sequencing platforms. two basic graph based algorithms exist for assemblers: the first one is based on overlap-layout-consensus graphs, such as newbler  <cit>  and mira  <cit> . in these packages, the algorithm computes all pair-wise overlaps between reads to build an overlap graph. then, the overlap graph is used to compute a layout of reads and consensus sequence of contigs. the second algorithm is based on de-bruijn graphs, such as the algorithm used in velvet  <cit> , abyss  <cit> , and several other packages in which sequence reads are broken into smaller sequences of dna, referred to as k-mers, where k denotes the length of these smaller sequences  <cit> . the de-bruijn graph is built based on the overlaps of length k- <dig> between these k-mers rather than the actual reads. the assembly algorithms and their implementations become typically complex with large volumes of sequence data.

the objectives of this pilot study was to determine the framework for proper levels of genome coverage using illumina sequencing,  <dig> sequencing, and a combination of  <dig> and illumina sequencing when both technical factors and economic factors were considered, to compare the assembly of sequences using different software packages with various parameters, and to develop a cost-effective de novo assembly strategy for the upcoming catfish whole genome sequencing. here we report sequencing and assembly of twenty-four bac clones of the largest contig of catfish physical map using  <dig> sequencing, illumina sequencing, and a combination of these sequencing technologies, and compare their assembly using several de novo assembly softwares. based on the assembly, we attempted to identify conserved syntenies among catfish and several fish species whose genome sequences are available using blast  <cit>  sequence similarity comparisons.

RESULTS
generation of short sequencing reads from pooled catfish bac clones
to assess the de novo assembly strategy for the catfish whole genome sequencing project, twenty-four bac clones were selected from the largest contig  of the bac-based catfish physical map. individual clones included in the contig were pooled together and sequenced by using both  <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies. based on the physical map, the estimated length of the contig spanned approximately  <dig> mb long. as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  from  <dig> single-end reads,  <dig> , <dig> from illumina 72-bp paired-end reads from a 350-bp insert library were generated. after adaptor and bac vector trimming, and low quality reads filtering, a total of  <dig> mb  <dig> sequences and  <dig>  mb illumina paired-end sequences were obtained . these represented approximately  <dig> x and  <dig>  x sequence coverage of the contig for  <dig> and illumina sequencing, respectively. all the sequences have been deposited to the catfish genome database cbarbel .

comparison of de novo assemblers for  <dig> reads and illumina reads
a number of sequence assemblers have been developed recently to cope with sequences generated from the next generation sequencers. to determine the most appropriate assembler and its associated k-values  to use for the de novo assembly of  <dig> reads and illumina reads, we compared several existing assemblers: newbler, velvet, abyss, mira and a commercial software, clc genomics workbench http://www.clcbio.com. the celera assembler v <dig>  was also considered, but our illumina sequences generated a while ago was not long enough for the assembler. the metrics used to evaluate the assembly included n <dig>  the average contig size, the maximum contig size and the number of contigs.

as highlighted in table  <dig>  for  <dig> sequences, newbler allowed the most effective assembly, compared to velvet, mira, or clc genomics workbench. with newbler, the best assembly was achieved at seed length  of  <dig> at which  <dig> of contigs were assembled, with n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, average contig size of  <dig>  bp, and maximum contig length of  <dig>  bp. for illumina sequences, abyss and velvet provided more effective assemblies than clc genomics workbench . the best assembly using abyss was achieved at k-value of  <dig> at which  <dig> contigs were assembled with n <dig> of  <dig> , average contig size of  <dig>  bp, and maximum contig size of  <dig>  bp. velvet at k-value of  <dig> generated a similar assembly to that of abyss with n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, average contig size of  <dig>  bp, and maximum contig size of  <dig>  bp, but with significantly greater number of contigs. similar results were found in a recent study using abyss  <cit> .

assembly strategy for the combination of  <dig> and illumina reads
the hybrid assembly is attempted by combining all reads from both  <dig> and illumina platform. using the combination of two types of sequencing reads, we tested velvet, abyss, newbler and clc for hybrid assembly. using a single assembler, abyss with k-value  <dig> provided a good quality assembly, with n <dig> value of approximately  <dig>  kb and a maximum contig size of approximately  <dig> kb. newbler v <dig>  performed better for the assembly of the same sequence data that generated a n <dig> value of approximately  <dig>  kb and a maximum contig size of  <dig> kb. however, assembly derived from  <dig> reads plus illumina reads by using a single assembler did not provide much advantage as compared with the assembly of using only  <dig> reads. rather than using a single assembler for the hybrid assembly, it is crucial to develop a suitable strategy by using several assemblers for the assembly of combination of different types of sequencing reads.

the strategy for the hybrid assembly is shown in figure  <dig>  initially,  <dig> sequences were assembled using newbler and illumina sequences were assembled using velvet. velvet rather than abyss was used for the assembly of illumina reads because some of the contigs generated by abyss contained internal gaps since abyss has the capability to merge contigs using paired-end information, and these internal gaps may influence the subsequent assembly attempts. after the initial separate assembly, the contigs assembled and the remaining unassembled sequences were subjected to a secondary assembly using mira. this additional assembly step with mira maximized the complementary advantages of  <dig> and illumina reads, resulting in the assembly of  <dig> contigs. the maximum contig size was  <dig>  bp. all  <dig> bac end sequences from the same physical map contig generated in our previous studies  <cit>  were aligned to the hybrid assembled contigs, suggesting that the sequence coverage is near completion and gaps are small, as expected from the size estimation. the contigs sequences have been deposited to catfish genome database cbarbel http://www.animalgenome.org/catfish/cbarbel/contig <dig> 

several studies have utilized two-step assembly strategy for the assembly of illumina and  <dig> sequences: in an effort to sequence the whole genome of a model fungi sordaria macrospora, nowrousian et al.  <cit>  pre-assembled  <dig> reads first, and then constructed an assembly by using the combined raw data from both illumina and  <dig> reads using velvet assembler; in a different study, the whole genome sequence reads from a bacteria, geobacter sulfurreducens, illumina reads were alone pre-assembled first and the contigs generated from this assembly plus the singletons and the  <dig> reads were then assembled using newbler  <cit> .

depth of sequence coverage required for effective de novo assembly
the depth of sequence coverage needed for effective sequence assembly depends on the genome size, the gc content  <cit>  and repetitive elements content of the organism, and the sequence read lengths. in addition, error correction algorithms used in assemblers can be utilized effectively when the depth of coverage is high  <cit> . the beijing genomics institute sequenced the giant panda genome using  <dig> bp illumina reads at a coverage of  <dig> x  <cit>  leaving a small number of gaps that may be filled by sanger sequencing  <cit> . in this pilot project, we evaluated the influence of depth of sequence coverage of different types of sequencing data sets on the overall assembly. as shown in figure  <dig>  the n <dig> values increased almost linearly until the  <dig> sequences reached  <dig> x coverage. after  <dig> x sequence coverage, additional  <dig> sequencing generated slightly greater n <dig> values, but was not cost effective any longer. we understand that our  <dig> sequences were generated with older chemistry and overall sequence length was relatively short, but the point is that with relatively short  <dig> sequences, assembly quality is initially positively correlated with sequence coverage. however, when the sequence coverage reached a certain level , additional sequence coverage was no longer effective . similarly, with illumina sequencing, the n <dig> values increased almost linearly with the sequence coverage up to  <dig> x sequence coverage . however, additional illumina sequencing was ineffective in providing a better sequence assembly, as reflected in the plateau n <dig> values after  <dig> x sequence coverage . apparently, the assembly that can be achieved may be related to sequence read lengths, e.g., the higher level of genome coverage may not help if the sequence read length is short.

an effective sequencing strategy is to use a hybrid sequencing strategy of illumina plus  <dig> sequencing. in order to determine if a hybrid approach is cost effective, we evaluated assembly of the contig using various  <dig> and illumina sequence coverage combinations. as shown in figure  <dig>  inclusion of  <dig> sequencing very effectively increased n <dig> of the assemblies. interestingly, a small sequence coverage of  <dig> sequencing provided almost as effective sequence assembly as a large  <dig> sequence coverage. only when the  <dig> sequences reached a very high sequence coverage , the overall sequence assembly was more effective with much greater n <dig>  n <dig> values of  <dig> sequences at 6- <dig> x provided similar assemblies. similar but different assembly patterns were observed with various sequence coverages of illumina sequences: with or without  <dig> sequences, the n <dig> values of the assemblies increased almost proportional to illumina sequence coverages up to  <dig> x sequence coverage; thereafter, additional illumina sequences were not effective in increasing the n <dig> values. considering the cost for the two sequencing platforms,  <dig> sequencing is much more expensive than illumina sequencing, e.g.,  <dig> x catfish whole genome sequencing with  <dig> sequencing technology will cost $ <dig> , which is almost the cost to get  <dig> x catfish whole genome sequences using illumina sequencing. taking the cost into consideration, it appears that the assembly of  <dig> ×  <dig> sequences and  <dig> x illumina sequences was the most effective . the importance of longer reads should be noted. in the catfish genome, and perhaps many fish genomes as well, there are long repetitive elements such as the mariner-like dna transposons. long reads helps to get through such long repetitive regions. working with the genome of rhodopseudomonas palustris, schadt et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that long reads generated from pacbio sequencing can help resolve assembly difficulties in a repetitive region spanning  <dig>  kb, which otherwise cannot be assembled by using illumina sequencing. in our case with the catfish genome segment here, the failure of contig assembly was mostly caused by repetitive sequences, and therefore, the adoption of pacbio, or similar long sequencing platforms, should enhance the contig assembly.

comparison of assembly with illumina paired-end and single-end reads and scaffolding
paired-end reads are the reads in pairs such that each pair is of a known distance from each other. although the cost associated with library construction of single-end reads is much cheaper than that of paired-end reads, because of their linked nature, paired-end reads are important for de novo assembly because they can improve the assembly by spanning repeat regions, anchoring reads to the sequence within repeat regions, and ordering of contigs into larger scaffolds  <cit> . to investigate the advantage of paired-end reads over single-end reads, we compared the assembly between illumina paired-end and single-end reads with the same set of sequence data using abyss with a k-value of  <dig>  table  <dig> clearly shows the advantage of paired-end reads over single-end reads for de novo assembly. the n <dig> value with illumina paired-end reads is approximately  <dig>  kb, which is  <dig>  times larger than the n <dig> value of single-end reads assembly . similarly, the maximum contig size with illumina paired-end reads is almost  <dig> kb, while the maximum contig size of single-ends reads assembly was only  <dig>  kb . the difference in the number of assembled contigs is more dramatic, with  <dig> contigs from paired-end reads assembly but  <dig>  contigs with single-end reads assembly. in a recent study, the giant panda whole genome draft was completed by using multiple paired-end reads libraries with different insert size  <cit> , which initiated the eukaryotic genome sequencing and assembly based mostly on the next generation sequencing platform. clearly, use of multiple libraries in various sizes would increase the effectiveness of sequence assemblies, but that was not tested in this study.

the importance of paired reads is not limited to contig assembly. they are even more important in scaffolding by bringing separate contigs together into larger scaffolds. for instance, when the paired-end reads of illumina sequences were used, the  <dig> contigs were brought together into  <dig> scaffolds. the scaffolding capacity of paired-end reads is under estimated in this study because we used a library with small insert size of  <dig> bp. the scaffolding capacity of paired-end reads should be much greater if larger insert libraries were used. the bac end sequences helped in scaffolding, but were less effective than expected because of the small number of the available mate paired bac end sequences within this contig. of the  <dig> bac end sequences falling within this contig, only  <dig> were mate paired reads. along with the paired-end reads of illumina sequences, these bac end sequences allowed assembly of  <dig> contigs into  <dig> scaffolds with the largest scaffold of  <dig>  bp.

in order to have a sense of comparison of the sequence assembly in this pilot study with similar studies or those achieved through whole genome sequencing, we summarized contig size information in table  <dig>  in terms of n <dig> and average contig sizes, the assemblies presented here with catfish is similar to those of the pilot study with atlantic salmon  <cit> . a direct comparison of the assemblies here with only one million base pairs and those with the whole genome sequences is difficult because the sequence complexities and sequencing strategies were different. however, if the similar results from this pilot study could be extended to the genome scale with similar genome coverage, the results to be achieved with catfish whole genome sequencing would be similar to those achieved with tetraodon, fugu, or atlantic cod.

repetitive content analysis and annotation of the assembled region
repetitive content of the assembly were assessed by using repeatmasker http://www.repeatmasker.org against zebrafish repeat database. a total of  <dig>  bp  sequences were masked. the content of various types of repetitive elements in the assembled region is presented in table  <dig>  the most abundant type of repeat was found to be dna transposons totaling  <dig> % of the assembly, which confirmed our previous findings that dna transposons were the most abundant type of repetitive elements in the catfish genome  <cit> . however, the  <dig> % of dna transposons found here was almost twice the amount as previously assessed  <cit> .

overall,  <dig> % of all reads were assembled. that is to say,  <dig> % of the generated sequences were not assembled. apparently, many unassembled sequences were very short reads, but they are probably also repetitive in nature so that prohibit themselves to be assembled. blast was used to assess the nature of the unassembled sequences against the nr database with a cutoff e-value of 1e- <dig>  most hits were repetitive elements such as transposable elements , retrotransposons reverse transcriptase-like sequences , zinc-finger protein-like , recombinase-like protein , among others. in addition, the unassembled sequences were also used for blast search against themselves to determine if they are highly repetitive sequences themselves. approximate 79% of the unassembled reads can hit more than  <dig> other reads, 55% of which hit more than  <dig> other reads. taken together, these results indicated that the unassembled reads are located in the repetitive region of the genome, resulting in gaps when conducting de novo assembly. therefore, long reads are crucially important to go through such repetitive regions of the genome.

the repeat masked contig sequences were searched against ncbi nr database using both blastx searches and genscan gene model prediction algorithm  <cit>  to identify the genes in the assembled region. a total of  <dig> genes were identified . these genes included creatine kinase , erythroid differentiation-related factor  <dig>  tonsoku-like dna repair protein, proteasome  <dig> s subunit atpase, zinc finger rna-binding domain containing protein  <dig> b, kinase a -anchor protein  <dig>  neuronal pas domain protein  <dig>  e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase ubr <dig>  photoreceptor outer segment membrane glycoprotein 2-like, methyltransferase-like protein  <dig> d, adp-ribosylation factor  <dig>  asparaginase homolog, kinesin family member  <dig> a, transmembrane protein  <dig>  polypeptide n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase like, cu <dig> , exonuclease 3'-5' domain containing  <dig>  and numb homolog protein .

after gene annotation, we attempted to identify conserved syntenies in the assembled region with the genomes of four fish model species, medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and zebrafish. the order of the catfish genes was oriented by anchoring the scaffolds to the physical map by using bac end sequences. one syntenic block containing seven genes  and a second syntenic block containing four genes  are highly conserved, across most of these fish species . several other smaller syntenic blocks were also somewhat conserved that contained 2- <dig> genes . however, the distance spanning these genes is different. all these  <dig> genes were found in catfish physical map contig of approximately  <dig> mb, but these genes were found to be located in a genomic region of approximately  <dig> mb in stickleback,  <dig> mb in tetraodon, over  <dig> mb in medaka, and  <dig> mb in zebrafish. nonetheless, gene arrangements in the catfish genome are most similar to that in zebrafish, consistent with their phylogenetic relations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrated that for the catfish genome, the hybrid sequencing strategy using both  <dig> and illumina is more effective than either alone, especially when sequencing costs were also considered, as demonstrated with the potato genome project  <cit> . initially, the effectiveness of sequence assembly was almost linearly correlated with the depth of sequence coverage, but additional sequencing after a certain level  provided no additional power for effective sequence assembly. the best assembly software for  <dig> reads appears to be newbler as assembly statistics resulted in the lowest number of contigs and highest values for the contig size as well as n <dig> value. using the same set of assembly criteria, both abyss and velvet appear to be suitable for the assembly of illumina reads. a two-step strategy, initially using newbler for  <dig> reads and velvet for illumina reads followed by using mira, seemed to provide highly effective sequence assembly. sequencing of this genomic region allowed identification of  <dig> protein encoding genes. their genomic arrangements are highly conserved among catfish, zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon, and stickleback.

it should be noted that this work dealt with only one million base pair region of the catfish genome. therefore, while this work provide framework for planning of whole genome sequencing of the catfish genome, extension of technical parameters from this work to whole genome sequencing requires additional work. the combination of  <dig> and illumina sequencing may not be effective in dealing with fish whose genomes are polyploidy or contain complex and long repeat structures. even for the catfish genome, sequence assembly was attenuated with repeats, and therefore, an appropriate level of long reads, e.g., those produced by pacbio sequencing  <cit> , to pass through the repeat regions may prove to be very useful.
