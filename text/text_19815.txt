BACKGROUND
the feeding regimen used in beef production influence both the economics of beef production and the nutritional quality of beef. in temperate regions, grazed and conserved grass systems are considered less expensive options than concentrate feeds . human health advantages associated with the consumption of beef reared on pasture have been proposed, particularly relating to the supply of essential fatty acids   <cit> , with beef from pasture systems considered nutritionally superior to beef from concentrate-based systems, due to its greater conjugated linoleic acid content  <cit> , n-3/n- <dig> fa ratio  <cit>  and vitamin e content  <cit> . dietary intakes of total n- <dig> pufas, as well as plasma and platelet concentrations of lc n- <dig> pufa, were significantly higher in subjects who consumed red meat from pasture-fed animals compared with those who consumed red meat from concentrate-fed animals  <cit> . in addition, there is some evidence that regular outdoor exercise has positive effects on the health and welfare status of cattle  <cit> .

clearly, authentication of beef would be of economic benefit as it would increase consumer confidence in the characteristics, source and subsequent pricing of meat based on their production system. there have been a number of approaches used to authenticate meat products in a range of species including carotenoid content and color measurements  <cit> , triacylglycerol profiles  <cit> , volatile hydrocarbons  <cit> , stable isotope ratios  <cit> , metabolomic data  <cit>  or combinations of these variables  <cit> . in addition, a number of studies have explored the possibility of utilising functional genomics, in particular, transcriptome and proteome profiling, to discriminate between animals reared under different production systems, as it is hypothesised that different diets will alter the expression of genes involved in fat/muscle metabolism .

in order to achieve the ultimate goal of finding both individual biomarkers and/or molecular signatures with which to authenticate meat products as having originated from pasture-based systems, it is necessary to identify a robust and reproducible panel of genes which are differentially expressed  between muscle of cattle raised in pasture and concentrate-based production systems. therefore, the objectives of this study were: 1) to identify a panel of de genes in the muscle of cattle raised outdoors on pasture compared to animals raised indoors on a concentrate-based diet; 2) to identify relationships or functional commonalities between these genes, and 3) to subsequently identify an optimum panel which will classify the meat based on a pasture-based production system.

principal component analysis
principal component analysis  was performed on the entire qpcr dataset of  <dig> beef samples to identify any existing clustering behaviour . principal components   <dig> and  <dig> accounted for  <dig> and 15 %, respectively, of the variance in this dataset; a score plot on these two components revealed an almost complete separation of samples on the basis of the production system . only two samples of each class i.e. outdoor/pasture-fed and indoor/concentrate-fed were mis-classified in the score plot. in general, the concentrate-fed animals exhibited a greater dispersion along pc <dig> than the outdoor/pasture-fed animals, a trend which was reversed on pc <dig>  the loading plot for pc <dig>  can be used to indicate which variables were responsible for the sample clustering observed. loading  <dig> reveals that the location of indoor/concentrate-fed animals was determined mainly by genes with positive values in the loading plot although it is the cumulative effect of all genes that determines a sample score in pc space. similarly for pc <dig>  the greater spread of concentrate-fed animals is particularly influenced by expression levels of npnt and, to a lesser extent, stk <dig> .fig.  <dig>

to determine the minimum number and identity of genes necessary to effect the separation of the two animal classes, genes were de-selected in a  <dig> step procedure , and the pca analysis was re-run after each deletion step. the effect of these deletions was monitored by tracking correct classification rates for each pca model; these were stable at four mis-classifications  until, at the final deletion step, only three genes  were retained in the analysis. classification based on these genes resulted in a classification rate of 95 % of the outdoor/pasture-fed animals  and 100 % of indoor/concentrate-fed animals. several other three-gene permutations were studied but none could model the data as well as the combination of alad, eif4ebp <dig> and npnt.

discriminant analysis and support vector machine 
discriminant analysis was applied to this dataset using discriminant partial least squares  regression and linear discriminant analysis. models were developed on a calibration sample set which contained 50 % of each of the two sample groups i.e.  <dig> the outdoor/pasture-fed and  <dig> indoor/concentrate-fed. the model produced from this latter exercise was then used to predict the class affiliation of the remaining 50 % of the samples. all of these methods produced the same result i.e.  <dig> of the  <dig> prediction samples were correctly classified. the same  <dig> the outdoor/pasture-fed samples identified as clustering anomalously in the pca score plot were mis-classified in each of these cases. both models correctly classified  <dig>  % of the animals i.e.  <dig> of  <dig> animals. both of the mis-classified animals belonged to the outdoor/pasture-fed group. the most accurate svm model produced correct classification rates of 100 % for the concentrate-fed animals and  <dig>  %  for the the outdoor/pasture-fed animals.

regulatory elements within the promoter region of the differentially regulated genes
the pattern of co-expression of the de genes suggests there may be a common regulator. the up-regulated genes were correlated with each other, the down regulated genes were correlated with each other, while both groups of genes were in negative correlation with each other. this trend is illustrated clearly in a heat map . to explore this possibility the de genes were analysed using a range of in-silico approaches with the aim of uncovering common regulators that may influence their expression. a number of upstream regulators were identified in ingenuity pathway analysis, including atp7b , meldonium , cholesterol  and srebf <dig> . in-silico analysis of the promoter sequences of the bovine de genes, supported the hypothesis that these putative transcription factor binding sites  are present in the bovine promoters.

a number of histone modifications were significantly over-represented in the region 1kb upstream of the human orthologues when analysed using a web resource  which collates data from genome-wide chip-seq experiments performed on transcription factors and histone modifications   <cit> . selected histone modifications derived from cscan present within the muscle cell line , along with selected putative regulatory elements identified within the bovine promoters  are summarised in .

discussion
the identification of a panel of de genes in the muscle of cattle raised outdoors on pasture compared to cattle raised indoors on concentrate feed offers the potential for transcriptomic data to be used in discriminant approaches to classify beef based on its production system. the finding that the relative expression data from three genes; alad, eif4ebp <dig> and npnt is sufficient to model the two production systems in this study is a promising step with regard to authentication. the transcriptomic data generated from this experiment enabled the correct classification of 95 % of outdoor/pasture-fed animals and 100 % of indoor/concentrate-fed animals.

of significance in this study was the fact that a substantial proportion of the de genes were unequivocally involved in fa metabolism in particular β-oxidation and fa transport. in this regard, the findings are very consistent with alterations in enzyme activities observed in cattle fed on perennial ryegrass pasture versus those fed on a more concentrated maize silage ration in a similar authentication study performed by cassar-malek et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . here, the authors reported an ‘oxidative switch’ in response to pasture diet with no effect on the muscle’s glycolytic metabolism. at a transcriptomic level however, the de genes identified in this study contrast to those highlighted by cassar-malek et al. in  <dig>  where selenoprotein w was highlighted as the most promising classifier and the three main categories of de genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, contraction and protein metabolism not lipid metabolism  <cit> .

more surprisingly, this present study is highly consistent at the transcriptomic level with an in vitro study which examined pparδ activation in human myotubes  <cit> . in this study, five of  <dig> differentially upregulated genes  were also upregulated in the muscle of the outdoor/pasture-fed animals, including; cpt1a, klf <dig>  plin <dig> , abca <dig> and acsl <dig>  it was concluded from the study that the principal effect of ppar activation in human myotubes was an increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity, but not mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator- <dig>  family of transcriptional coactivators are central in transducing and integrating physiological signals to the transcriptional machinery controlling mitochondrial functional capacity  <cit> . many of the genes reported to be de are downstream targets of ppar or key to the regulation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation e.g. carnitine palmitoyltransferase  <dig>  <cit> .

a number of the up-regulated genes in the outdoor/pasture-fed animals are fundamental to the β-oxidation of fatty acids in muscle tissue, including cpt1b, plin <dig>  fyn and fabp <dig>  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b  is involved in the transport of long chain fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane and is the rate limiting step in lipid catabolism  <cit> . interestingly, a separate study reported that cpt1b was up-regulated in the st muscle of grazing lambs relative to indoor lambs  <cit> . plin <dig> displays an ability to both regulate oxidative gene expression and to facilitate the release of fa from muscle for mitochondrial oxidation and is specifically expressed in cells that actively oxidize fa such as red muscle  <cit> . fatty acid binding protein  <dig>  promotes the transport of fa in the cytoplasm to organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum for triacylglycerol and cholesterol synthesis and for lipoprotein assembly  <cit>  and shuttles ligands from the cytosol to the nuclear receptor pparβ/δ thereby enhancing the transcriptional activity of the receptor  <cit> . an exploration of the topographical arrangement of the de expressed genes in cytoscape™  <cit>  highlighted fyn as a hub gene with extensive connectivity to several genes including a large number of the de genes, i.e. up-regulated; ccl <dig>  klf <dig>  abca <dig>  fabp <dig>  acsl <dig> and down-regulated; msmo <dig>  tulp <dig>  eml <dig> . fyn is a tyrosine specific phospho-transferase and a member of the large src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which forms a ternary protein complex composed of fyn, lkb <dig>  and the master metabolic regulator/sensor, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase  is assembled with cd <dig>  <cit> . when exogenous fa concentrations are low, cd36-bound fyn can access and phosphorylate lkb <dig>  which induces lkb <dig> nuclear relocation, thus reducing the cytosolic lkb <dig> concentrations available to activate ampk. hence, when exogenous fa concentrations are low, ampk is quiescent. however, when exogenous fa concentrations rise, fyn dissociates from the protein complex, allowing the cytosolic lkb <dig> to activate ampk, thus enhancing fa oxidation through the inactivation of acetyl-coa carboxylase  <cit> .

the profile of de genes are supported by the fa analysis on the muscle of animals raised outdoors on pasture, where an increase in the proportions of total n- <dig> pufa, specifically  was observed, relative to those raised indoors on concentrates  <cit> . in addition, the majority of the up-regulated genes correlated positively with total n- <dig> pufa and negatively with n- <dig> pufa concentrations in the muscle of these animals, indicating that these genes could be altering the n-3/n- <dig> pufa ratio in a coordinated manner within the skeletal muscle of outdoor/pasture-fed cattle. these findings concord with the wider literature, with respect to the measurable changes observed in the fa profiles of meat derived from the outdoor/pasture-fed animals .

the relationship between rearing animals outdoors on pasture and the deposition of certain fa in muscle and adipose tissue is well established . thus, c18:3n- <dig>  c22:5n- <dig> and c22:6n- <dig>  are typically elevated in pasture-fed animals compared to animals fed cereal concentrates. the higher levels of these fa in beef from pasture-fed animals can be attributed directly to the higher c18:3n- <dig> content of the grass  compared to cereal concentrates   <cit> . the reverse is true of the n- <dig> fa, c18:2n- <dig> and its long chain counter parts, such as c20:4n- <dig>  which are higher in beef from concentrate-fed animals and reflect the higher c18:2n- <dig> content of cereal concentrates relative to pasture  <cit> . interestingly, no relationships were found between the de genes and conjugated linoleic acid, which is typically elevated in beef from pasture-fed animals and also in the outdoor-pasture reared animals in this study  <cit> .

the differential expression of the genes highlighted in this study may be attributed to a number of variables including: 1) greater availability of pufa, particularly n- <dig> pufa in the diet , 2) differences in the foraging behavior between the outdoor/pasture and indoor/concentrate-fed animals and 3) greater availability of bioactive bioflavonoids in the pasture. in relation to the first point, a number of genes have been reported to be regulated by fa, including genes involved in fa transport, activation of fa, mitochondrial β-oxidation and peroxisomal oxidation. it has been reported that the regulation of gene transcription by fa is due to changes in the activity or abundance of at least four different transcription factor families including ppar, liver x receptor , hepatic nuclear factor  <dig>  and sterol regulatory element binding protein   <cit> . analysis of the transcriptome of porcine muscle indicated that animals with higher percentages of pufa exhibit a shift toward a more oxidative metabolic state and exhibit increased mitochondrial function, fa uptake and oxidation  <cit> . this supports the concept that a greater availability of n- <dig> pufa in the diet is directly influencing the muscle transcriptome especially with respect to its fa metabolic functioning.

also relevant to this study is the fact that the outdoor/pasture-fed animals are afforded the opportunity to exercise their natural behavioral pattern  <cit>  which for cattle reared on pasture includes significant periods of foraging or food-search behaviour  <cit> . this greater exposure to exercise  is another potential environmental contributor to the differential gene expression observed in the outdoor/pasture-fed group  <cit> . it is widely established that endurance exercise promotes phenotypic adaptations in skeletal muscle causing a shift toward a more oxidative phenotype. endurance type exercise favours the growth and expression of type i and type iia  muscle fibres  <cit> . oxidative fibres contain a high density of mitochondria and preferentially utilise fa as a source of energy while fast contracting glycolytic fibres which contain fewer mitochondria use relatively more glucose in this context a relationship between exercise  and increased proportions of oxidative type i muscle fibres has been established  <cit> .

while gene regulation was not examined experimentally in this study, some of the in-silico analysis suggests that there may be common regulatory influences underpinning the correlated expression of the de genes in this study. ipa identified a number of upstream regulators relating to fa metabolism including cholesterol and srebf <dig>  putative transcription factor binding sites relating to adipogenesis were also identified in regions upstream of the de expressed genes including ppar, ccatt/enhancer binding protein , screb and gata. literature searches on all the de genes identified other regulators such as micrornas which were relevant to ldlr and abca <dig>  the most dominant regulator of these de genes which was cited in the literature, highlighted in the pathway analysis and inferred from other experiments was ppar. ppars constitute a family of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors that are activated by all long-chain fa or their derivatives and also specific synthetic ligands  <cit> . in addition to this pparδ expression is increased by exercise training in both rodents and humans, but in addition to this, ampk and pparδ agonists are recognised as exercise mimetics  <cit> . hence, the greater availability of ppar ligands in the form of pufa from the diet combined with increased endurance type exercise might together drive the formation of a more oxidative phenotype in the muscle thereby up-regulating ppar responsive genes. the analysis of protein-protein interaction  networks in the context of the de genes, highlighted fyn as an important hub gene connecting a number of the de genes. both fyn and ampk have been shown to be implicit in linking fa uptake to β-oxidation in myocytes  <cit> . in addition, many small molecules and phytochemicals derived from plants have similar chemical structures to known kinase inhibitors that can inhibit fyn and other src family kinases  <cit> . finally, the in silico analysis highlighted some histone modifications as being significantly over-represented in human paralogues of the down-regulated gene list. this epigenetic angle is also is supported by a recent study which identified global reductions in acetylation of histones and increased methylation of specific genes in dna derived from the mammary tissues of animals receiving a high-concentrate diet versus a mixed forage diet  <cit> .

while this study highlights alad, eif4ebp <dig> and npnt as potential transcriptomic classifiers of the two contrasting production systems, it also highlights potential regulators and drivers which may be influencing the pattern of expression of the de genes with subsequent effects of the n3/n <dig> fa ratio within the muscle. however, these potential classifiers would require validation across a wider range of breeds, which naturally vary in their n-3/n- <dig> ratios irrespective of production system  <cit> . also different geographical contexts and other permutations implicit in the production systems which effect both diet and exercise could also impact on the transcriptome in an as yet unforeseen way. if however, the genes highlighted in this study are powerful enough to discriminate across a wider range of contexts, there may be the potential to develop this information into a robust assay e.g. an elisa system poses less technical barriers, is less time consuming and more robust than using relative quantities derived from gene expression data.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the outdoor/pasture-fed group were characterised by the differential expression of  <dig> genes in muscle tissue, compared to the indoor/concentrate-fed group. a significant number of these genes are involved in fa metabolic processes including β-oxidation; ppar and ampk/fyn were highlighted as potential regulators. the differences in the dietary availabilities of pufa and bioflavonoids as well as alterations to the muscle physiology due to differential foraging habits between the two production systems are proposed drivers of the observed differential expression. the normalised expression levels of three genes alad, eif4ebp <dig> and npnt are sufficient to model the two production systems types in this context and hence this data has potential in the wider setting to be developed as a means of authenticating production systems. the robustness of the de genes would need to be tested across a broader range of contexts to further determine their potential as classifiers, as different breeds and muscle types have contrasting characteristics with respect to both oxidative capacity and fa deposition, irrespective of production system.
