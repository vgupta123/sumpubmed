BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rnas that regulate eukaryotic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . they are transcribed as long precursor rna molecules  and are successively processed by two key rnases, namely drosha and dicer, into their mature forms of ~ <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . these small rnas regulate gene expression by binding to target sites in the 3' untranslated region of mrnas   <cit> . recognition of the 3'utr by mirnas is mediated through complementary hybridization between nucleotides 2– <dig>  numbered from the 5' end  of the small rnas, and complementary sequences present in the 3'utrs of mrnas  <cit> . perfect or nearly perfect complementarities between mirnas and their 3'utrs induce mrna cleavage by the rna-induced silencing complex , whereas imperfect base matching induces translational silencing through various molecular mechanisms  <cit> , namely inhibition of translation initiation and activation of mrna storage in p-bodies and/or stress granules  <cit> . interestingly, mirnas also direct rapid deadenylation of target mrnas, leading to decapping and rapid mrna decay by the combined activities of the exosome  and the exoribonuclease xrn <dig>   <cit> .

since the discovery of the first mirna in  <dig> in c. elegans  <cit> , thousands of mature mirnas have been uncovered in several species, suggesting that they appeared early in eukaryotic evolution and play fundamental roles in gene expression control. indeed, mirnas have been identified using a combination of bioinformatics, cloning and sanger sequencing, and lately through new generation sequencing methods, namely the roche  <dig> pyrosequencer, the solexa/illumina genome analyzer and the applied biosystems solid™ sequencer, in a wide range of eukaryotes, namely plants  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit> , fish  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , worms  <cit> , flies  <cit> , in the unicellular green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit>  and in viruses  <cit> . these small rnas were originally thought to regulate developmental processes only  <cit> , but recent studies show that they regulate a variety of other pivotal biological processes, namely differentiation  <cit> , immune response  <cit> , infection  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . the exact mechanism by which they regulate such a variety of molecular processes is not yet fully understood, however 2–3% of the human genes encode mirnas and approximately 30% of human mrnas contain mirna binding sites in their 3'utrs, suggesting major roles for these small rnas in eukaryotic gene regulation  <cit> .

the quantification of mirna expression has been technically challenging and rather expensive due to their small size, low abundance, low stability and contamination with other cellular rnas and mrna fragments. recently, the above mentioned parallel dna sequencing methodologies have been successfully applied to both mirna identification and quantification  <cit> . the enormous sequencing power of these technologies has overcome most of the technical hurdles associated to mirna identification and increased dramatically the number of mirnas deposited in public databases  <cit> . these new methodologies are also promoting large scale initiatives to identify most eukaryotic mirnas, understand their evolution and identify target genes and gene networks regulated by them.

in zebrafish ,  <dig> mirna genes encode  <dig> different mature mirnas  <cit> . however, deep dna sequencing has not yet been applied to this model organism and one is not sure whether those mirnas represent the full zf mirna population  <cit> . as in other eukaryotes, recent zf studies highlighted critical mirna roles in gene expression control since defective mirna processing arrested development  <cit> . also, a specific subset of mirnas is required for brain morphogenesis in zf embryos, but not for cell fate determination or axis formation  <cit> . in other words, mirnas play an important role in zf organogenesis and their expression at specific time points is relevant to organ formation and differentiation. since identification of the complete set of mirnas is fundamental to fully understand these and other fundamental biological processes, we have used high throughput  <dig> dna pyrosequencing technologies to fully characterize the zf mirna population. this study increased the total number of zf mirnas from  <dig> to  <dig> and identified several star sequences . in addition, mirnas predicted by homology were retrieved and novel mirna genes encoding known mirnas were identified.

RESULTS
 <dig> dna sequencing of zebrafish mirnas
in order to increase coverage of zf mirnas by  <dig> pyrosequencing, small rna libraries were prepared from zf samples collected at various developmental time points, i.e.,  <dig> hours post-fertilization ,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> days post-fertilization ,  <dig> dpf, and from young adult fish, adult brain, eyes, gills, muscle, heart, skin, fins and gut/liver . for this, total rna from each sample was isolated with trizol® and fractionated by page. small rnas ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in size were isolated from gels and subjected to two successive ligations, i.e., a first ligation with a 3' adapter was followed by a second ligation with a 5' adapter . first strand cdna synthesis was then carried out and pcr-amplified using adapter specific primers. specific tags for each cdna library corresponding to different developmental stages and tissues were incorporated into the pcr primers. pcr products of ~ <dig> nt in length were then purified from a 10% denaturing page containing  <dig> m urea. the  <dig> pcr products, corresponding to different developmental stages and to different mature tissues were sequenced using massively parallel dna pyrosequencing. raw data filtration was performed using specialist software incorporated into the flx genome sequencer   <cit> . the above mentioned sequencing tags and the sequencing adapters were identified computationally. reads with recognizable adapters were retrieved, adapter sequences were then removed, and those reads with size ≥  <dig> nt were analysed using mirdeep software  <cit> . the latter scores the compatibility of the position and frequency of the rna sequence with the secondary structure of the mirna precursor and identifies new, conserved and non-conserved mirnas with high confidence. mirdeep also estimates false positives by random permutation of the signature and structure-pairings in the input dataset to test the hypothesis that the structure  of true mirnas is recognized by dicer and causes the signature. in our study, the prediction of false positives was below 8%. since mirdeep is a highly stringent algorithm some mirnas are likely to escape detection. to minimize this problem the false negative rate was also calculated. for this, our sequencing data set was subjected to a megablast search using known mature mirnas present in mirbase  <dig> . perfect alignments were considered as true positives and the retrieved mirna list was then compared with the list of sequences predicted by mirdeep. false negatives were considered when mirnas were present in the blast analysis and missed in the mirdeep prediction. this estimated ~19% of false negatives in the mirdeep prediction list. for this reason, the search for novel and known mirnas in our zf samples was complemented by a megablast alignment between our dataset and mature sequences deposited in mirbase  <dig>  and also the novel mirna transcripts predicted by ensembl and by thatcher et al  <cit>  .

a total of  <dig>  high quality reads were obtained from cdna libraries using pyrosequencing mini-chips . from these,  <dig>  had a recognizable tag,  <dig>   and were retrieved after primer trimming,  <dig>  matched the zf genome using megablast and  <dig>  corresponded to mirna reads . the majority of mirna reads  matched known or predicted zf mirnas and less than 2% corresponded to putative novel mirnas. this approach identified a total of  <dig> mirnas:  <dig> of the known  <dig> mature mirnas which are annotated in mirbase  <dig>  plus  <dig> novel mirnas. the identified mirnas covered 90% of the known zf mirnas , previously identified by cloning and sanger sequencing or predicted by bioinformatics . the number of microrna reads predicted by bioinformatics algorithms was rather low  suggesting that the inability to detect and identify them by cloning and sanger sequencing may be related to their low abundance.

approximately 90% of the pyrosequencing reads matching the zf genome corresponded to mature mirna reads, 2% were novel mirnas. the distribution of pyrosequencing reads was similar in developmental  and adult tissue  samples.

dna pyrosequencing identified  <dig> mirnas.  <dig> were known from cloning and sanger sequencing and  <dig> were novel mirnas. these mature mirnas are encoded by  <dig> zf genes.

some of the known mirnas identified in this study were predicted previously by comparative genomics using homology and similarity searches.

reads matching the zf genome  were between  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length which corresponded to the mean length of mature mirnas . this high percentage of true mirnas showed that inefficient amplification, sequencing or trimming errors did not affect our experiment  <cit> . population statistics  <cit>  was then applied to calculate the population of mirnas expected in our dataset. representativeness assessed through a rarefaction analysis  <cit>  of the zf mirna population estimated a population size of  <dig> different mirnas . the homogeneity of the zf mirna population was evaluated by the chao <dig> diversity estimator  <cit> , which indicated the maximum number of mirnas expected for the pyrosequencing dataset. the chao <dig> reached a stable mean value of  <dig>  with lower and upper bounds of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for 95% confidence interval. this was in good agreement with the  <dig> zf mirnas identified:  <dig> mirnas identified by the  <dig> pyrosequencing approach  plus  <dig> mirnas previously identified by cloning and sanger sequencing . in other words, the total number of identified mirnas is near the upper limit of expected zf mirnas in the samples studied . however, one cannot discard the hypothesis that some novel mirnas may still be uncovered in tissues that were not analyzed in this study.

since  <dig>  pyrosequencing reads did not match the zf genome, we repeated the alignment using the mapping algorithm shrimp, which allows for introduction of insertions/deletions in the alignment. in this case, 87%  of those reads produced matches in the zf genome, however novel mirnas were not identified. this analysis revealed some sequence variation in known mirnas which may be related to sequencing errors or eventually to post-transcriptional mirna editing  <cit> . for example,  <dig> reads of the dre-mir- <dig> family had a  substitution at position  <dig>  but the low number of reads of each sequence did not permit unequivocal differentiation between mirna editing and sequencing errors. this should be investigated further in a new study.

mirna expression patterns in zebrafish
the  <dig> hpf sample, corresponding to the developmental sample series, yielded low number of sequencing reads corresponding to  <dig> different mirnas. the number of reads increased dramatically at late stages of development and  <dig> hpf sample produced the highest number of reads and the highest mirna diversity  . at  <dig> hpf lower number of reads and lower mirna diversity was observed. as zf reached the adult stage, the number of reads and the number of different mirnas raised again, which was consistent with previous studies  <cit> . this suggested that mirnas play an important role in differentiation and maintenance of tissue identity, rather than in tissue fate establishment  <cit> . in adult fish, the brain sample produced the highest number of reads and the highest mirna diversity . the gut/liver showed lower mirna diversity  and the skin produced the lowest number of reads corresponding to  <dig> different mirnas .

although the number of reads can be used to estimate mirna abundance  the variation in the total number of reads between samples would lead to erroneous interpretation of mirna expression patterns by direct comparison of absolute read numbers. to overcome this limitation, the number of reads per sample was normalized, as described by chen and colleagues  <cit> , and expression of some mirnas was validated by quantitative real-time pcr . after this, a global mirna expression profile was generated for zf . a large set of mirnas were expressed in more than one tissue while some were mainly expressed during development . others were tissue specific or showed strong expression in specific tissues . for example, the mir- <dig> family, dre-mir-135c and dre-mir- <dig> were mainly expressed during development, but the mir- <dig> family was absent in adult fish, while dre-mir-135c and dre-mir- <dig> showed decreased expression in mature organs with exception of the brain.

of the  <dig> known mirnas, which were also sequenced in this study, some were highly represented in all samples. for example, dre-mir- <dig> was the most abundant mirna during both development and in adult zf. its expression was slightly higher during late stages of development and highly increased in the central nervous system , as confirmed by qrt-pcr . this mirna alone accounted for ~48% of the total number of sequencing reads. at  <dig> hpf, when a significant part of the brain development was completed, dre-mir- <dig> represented 42% of the mirna pool. these values increased to 80% at  <dig> dpf and also in mature tissues where it represented 80% of brain and 54% of eye mirnas  <cit> . members of the let- <dig> family and dre-mir- <dig> showed high levels of expression in the majority of tissues, e.g., dre-mir- <dig> yielded 21% of muscle mirnas. finally, some mirnas were enriched in development and in a particular adult tissue; dre-mir-203a and dre-mir-203b were expressed early in development and maintained high level of expression in gills and skin. the heart showed accumulation of dre-mir-101a, dre-mir-130b, dre-mir-130c, dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig>  while dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir-133a expression was detected in both muscle and heart. the expression of mir-133a was confirmed by qrt-pcr and its relative concentration was higher in muscle than in other tissues . dre-mir-133b and dre-mir-133c were mainly found in muscle and were not detected in the heart, while dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> were specific of gut/liver and dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> were enriched in gills and skin.

novel zebrafish mirnas are mostly non-conserved
a large set of both conserved and non-conserved mirnas were previously identified in zf by cloning/sanger sequencing  <cit> , using mirna cdna libraries prepared mainly from brain and from few developmental stages, and also using bioinformatics  <cit> . our approach of isolating and preparing separated mirna cdna libraries from  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> dpf,  <dig> dpf, total adult and from brain, eyes, heart, gills, muscle, fins, skin and gut/liver resulted in identification of  <dig> new mirnas , using the mirdeep software package in combination with our data pipeline analysis . the mirdeep algorithm performed stringent searches based on the mirna biogenesis model  <cit>  and produced information on mirna conservation, thermodynamic stability, ability to form a hairpin with the shape and sequence of the pre-mirna molecule, number of sequences that matched mature mirna sequences and number of sequences that matched star sequences. this algorithm alone was able to detect  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas. our data pipeline  identified  <dig> known mirnas missed by mirdeep in our samples, resulting in a total of  <dig> known mirnas identified. the extension of this analysis to sequences predicted by ensembl and by thatcher et al  <cit>  permitted detection of two additional novel mirnas, raising the prediction number to  <dig> 

the  <dig> novel mirnas belong to  <dig> novel candidate mirna families  and to  <dig> conserved mirna families, according to our conservation criteria based in previous studies  <cit>  . the conservation of the novel mirnas was confirmed by blast analysis against mirbase  <dig>  and ensembl database. the novel conserved mirnas identified also showed 100% identity in the seed sequence between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig>  this criterion is largely used when assessing mirna conservation  <cit> , simultaneously with the mature and precursor identity. interestingly, the conserved novel mirnas retrieved by mirdeep, namely mir_ <dig> , mir_ <dig> , mir_ <dig> , mir_ <dig> , mir_ <dig> , mir_ <dig>  and mir_ <dig>  were also predicted as novel zf mirnas by ensembl algorithms . mir_ <dig> , and mir_ <dig> , although not retrieved by mirdeep, were considered putative novel mirnas since they were also predicted by ensembl algorithms after applying our complementary analysis. most of these novel mirnas were detected throughout development and in adult tissues indicating that they may be involved in differentiation or maintenance of tissue identity  <cit> . nine of the novel mirnas started with uridine , which is characteristic of the first nucleotide position of mature mirnas .

the novel mirnas were numbered sequentially from  <dig> to  <dig> 

star sequences were also identified for at least five of the novel mirnas, supporting the authenticity of the corresponding mirnas, as their detection is an important criterion for mirna validation . such star sequences are small rnas complementary to mature mirnas, which are produced during pre-mirna processing, but are not loaded into the risc complex and are degraded  <cit> . indeed, star sequences were not identified for  <dig> novel low abundance mirnas, most likely due to their rapid turnover. most of the new mirna genes were intergenic rather than intronic, however the novel highly expressed mir_ <dig> was non-conserved and intronic . this mirna was found within the coding region of the ank <dig> gene, which codes for an intracellular protein required for biogenesis and maintenance of membrane domains in both excitable and non-excitable cells in diverse tissues, namely erythrocyte, kidney, lung and brain  <cit> . some of the novel mirnas were encoded by more than one gene. for example, mir_ <dig> was encoded by  <dig> different genes and mir_ <dig>  mir_ <dig>  mir_ <dig> and mir_ <dig> were encoded by  <dig> different genes, as determined by mirdeep.

the expression of a conserved mirna , a non-conserved mirna for which the star sequence was also detected  and a non-conserved mirna for which the star sequence was not detected , was validated by qrt-pcr . as above, there was strong correlation between qrt-pcr and  <dig> pyrosequencing data. indeed, mir_ <dig> displayed the highest number of pyrosequencing reads and had higher relative abundance in the qrt-pcr analysis. also, mir_ <dig> and mir_ <dig> had similar levels of expression, but lower than mir_ <dig> 

target prediction for novel mirnas
the mirna targets can be predicted computationally with high confidence for conserved mirnas, but such predictions remain challenging for non-conserved mirnas due to restrictions imposed by the search algorithms used in the target prediction databases  <cit> . for the non-conserved mirnas only the more extensively paired interactions can be predicted with reasonable confidence. in order to minimize noise  in the prediction of targets, stringent criteria similar to those described by sunkar and colleagues  <cit>  were used. this was based on blast searches for antisense hits with less than  <dig> mismatches, with perfect seed match and thermodynamic stability using the rna hybrid software. forty two putative gene targets of the  <dig> newly identified mirnas, which were mainly involved in binding nucleotides, proteins or ions or had catalytic activity, were identified . the predominant biological functions of these predicted target genes were cellular processes related to metabolism and signal transduction and developmental processes, including embryonic patterning, vasculogenesis and neuron differentiation. most mirnas with predicted targets involved in developmental processes were detected in cdna libraries prepared from mirna samples collected during embryonic development. for example, mir_ <dig> was detected at  <dig> dpf; mir_ <dig> was detected at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf and  <dig> dpf; mir_ <dig> and mir_ <dig> were both detected at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf; mir_ <dig> was detected at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> dpf. the melk gene which is found in gills and is involved in erythrocyte development was predicted to be targeted by mirna_ <dig> raising the hypothesis that mir_ <dig> could be involved in erythrocyte development  <cit> . other possible targets encoded hypothetical proteins and, for this reason, were not included in our analysis. this approach was unable to identify candidate targets for some of the novel mirnas, a result that may be explained by the high stringency of the prediction algorithm because targets of conserved mir_ <dig> and mir_ <dig> were also missed. alternatively, some of these low abundance non-conserved mirnas may have appeared recently and do not yet have targets, or misannotation or incomplete annotation of the zf genome may have prevented identification of such targets.

star sequences of zebrafish micrornas
star sequences for 50% of the mirnas, both known and novel, were also detected and identified . this corresponded to  <dig> star sequences complementary to known mirnas. of these,  <dig> were sequenced previously  <cit>  or registered in mirbase and  <dig> were complementary to the novel mirnas. as expected, the majority of reads corresponded to annotated mirnas rather than to mirnas*. this was in agreement with the mirna biogenesis model and resulted from incorporation into the risc complex and protection from degradation of the strand with lower 5' end thermodynamic stability  <cit> . however, in some cases, the number of mirna* reads was similar or even higher than that of the corresponding mature mirnas . this could be explained by similar 5' end stability of mirna and mirna* strands and similar incorporation efficiency into the risc complex. for example, dre-mir-30e, dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> showed similar bias for both mature and star strands. in the case of dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir-142a, dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig>  the number of mirna* reads was considerably higher than that of mature mirna reads, suggesting that the mirna* strand was more stable than the mirna strand. therefore, it is likely that some mirnas* acquired mrna targets and could also regulate gene expression in zf  <cit> . quantification of mirna and mirna* expression by qrt-pcr  confirmed the higher relative abundance of mir-140* and mir-142a* and showed that dre-mir-142* was expressed during development while its mature mirna was not detected. the relative abundance of mir-199* and mir- <dig> determined by qrt-pcr further confirmed the pyrosequencing data .

discussion
to date,  <dig> zf mirnas have been identified using classical cloning and sanger sequencing methodologies  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> novel mirnas were added to the zf repertoire using massively parallel dna pyrosequencing of mirna cdna libraries prepared from different time points of the zf embryo development and from different tissues. this methodology retrieved  <dig> of the  <dig> known zf mirnas whose expression in different tissues and developmental stages were validated using northern blot analysis and/or in situ hybridizations. this high degree of data overlapping between cloning/sanger sequencing and dna pyrosequencing, plus the existence of target genes for the novel mirnas, validated our approach of mirna libraries fractionation and provided strong support for the authenticity of the newly identified mirnas. the pyrosequencing approach also produced important information about the relative abundance of the zf mirnas. during early development , the number of different mirnas was low , but expression level was high. the number of mirna reads was higher at  <dig> hpf and in young adult fish. among differentiated organs, brain and eyes showed the highest number of mirna reads. this confirmed previous data showing differences in temporal mirna expression and raised the hypothesis that many mirnas play a role in late development and are required for organ morphogenesis  <cit> .

zebrafish micrornas expression profile
the pyrosequencing data allowed us to build a mirna expression profile for developmental differentiation and for adult fish, based on the normalized number of reads. most mirnas were expressed in more than one tissue , others were tissue specific or showed stronger expression in specific tissues , while others were development specific. dre-mir-135c and dre-mir- <dig> were highly enriched at  <dig> hpf, but their relative expression decreased during embryo development. the data confirmed previous studies showing that dre-mir- <dig> expression is higher in development than in adult fish  <cit> . the mir- <dig> family was also present during development and was absent in adult zf  <cit> . the expression profile also highlighted results of giraldez and colleagues  <cit>  showing that mir- <dig> is essential for regulation of morphogenesis during development.

some mirnas were expressed ubiquitously. for example, dre-mir- <dig> was abundant during both development and in adult fish, and its expression increased slightly during late stages of development and in the central nervous system . this mirna alone accounted for ~48% of the pyrosequencing reads, a result that may be explained, at least in part, by the high copy number of its gene . at  <dig> hpf, when a significant part of the brain development had already occurred, dre-mir- <dig> represented 42% of the mirna pool and its relative abundance reached 80% at  <dig> dpf. in the adult tissues, it represented 80% of brain and 54% of eye mirnas. this is in agreement with previous studies in zf and other organisms showing that mir- <dig> is up-regulated during development of the nervous system and is the most abundant mirna in the adult brain  <cit> . also, neuronal differentiation is enhanced followed transfection of mir- <dig> in mouse neuronal stem cells  <cit> . taken together, the data suggest that dre-mir- <dig> may play an important role in zf development, neuronal differentiation and in regulation of brain functions  <cit> . on the other hand, dre-mir-203a and dre-mir-203b appeared early in development and maintained high levels of expression in adult fish, in particular in gills and skin. indeed, mir- <dig> is a skin-specific keratinocyte-derived mirna involved in keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> .

a subset of mirnas was expressed in differentiated tissues only. for example, dre-mir-101a, dre-mir-130b, dre-mir-130c, dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> were highly enriched in the heart, in agreement with previous in situ and northern blot studies  <cit> . dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir-133a were expressed in muscle and heart, where they play an important regulatory role in other organisms  <cit> . indeed, deletion of mir- <dig> altered regulation of cardiogenesis, electrical conduction and cell cycle of cardiomyocites, and mir- <dig> plus mir- <dig> regulate cardiac hypertrophy, as their over expression inhibits it. interestingly, dre-mir-133b and dre-mir-133c were mainly detected in muscle and were not present in the heart. finally, dre-mir- <dig> was specific of gut and liver while dre-mir- <dig> was liver specific  <cit> . this was not surprising because mir- <dig> plays important roles in regulation of metabolism and its silencing in high-fat fed mice resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis, decreased cholesterol synthesis and stimulated fatty-acid oxidation  <cit> .

expression and putative functions of the novel zebrafish mirnas
of the  <dig> novel mirnas identified in this study,  <dig> belong to conserved mirna families  according to the conservation criteria used in this study, and the others are non-conserved . most of the novel mirnas are encoded by a single gene, but  <dig> are multigenic. in the latter case, mirdeep, ensembl and rnafold analysis showed that different genes encoding a single mirna produce identical mirna hairpins. most of the novel mirnas produced lower number of reads than the majority of the conserved mirnas. this was not surprising since there is good correlation between mirna conservation and expression level  <cit> . therefore, the low abundance of the novel mirnas identified by pyrosequencing combined with the retrieval of 90% of the known zf mirnas  suggests that the vast majority of mirnas present in our samples were retrieved. however, one cannot exclude the hypothesis that new mirnas present in our dataset escaped identification due to the high stringency of the methodology used. also, it is possible that other low abundance and highly specific zf mirnas may still be discovered using other deep dna pyrosequencing strategies, namely solexa/illumina or solid™. finally, cdna libraries from tissues not screened in this study may still reveal new zf mirnas. recent bioinformatics analysis of the zf genome identified additional mirnas  <cit> , however we were unable to identify reads matching these putative mirnas using mirdeep alone or our pipeline data analysis system. this may be due to their very low expression level. again, other massively parallel dna pyrosequencing approaches may overcome these limitations and uncover such putative mirnas  <cit> .

our bioinformatics approach retrieved  <dig> candidate target genes of  <dig> novel mirnas. since we used stringent search criteria to minimize false positives one cannot exclude the possibility that some targets were missed. despite this, comparative analysis of the targets of the conserved mir_ <dig>  mir_ <dig> and mir_ <dig> with those of known mirnas produced significant overlapping, thus validating our target prediction approach. for example, mir_ <dig>  which belongs to the mir- <dig> family, has gfm <dig> and vox genes as putative targets. the mirbase targets version  <dig> also retrieved these genes as candidate targets for dre-mir- <dig>  similar results were obtained for mir_ <dig> where rnf <dig> gene was highlighted as a candidate target of this novel mirna of the mir- <dig> family. this result is also supported by retrieval of mir- <dig> in a blast search for mirnas that target rnf <dig> 

most of the predicted targets are involved in cellular and developmental processes, which is in agreement with their expression during development. indeed, the nrp2a gene, a putative target of mir_ <dig>  is involved in the differentiation of the nervous system, neural crest cell migration  <cit>  and in vegf-mediated vessel development  <cit> . this correlates with the expression pattern of this mirna at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf,  <dig> dpf and in the adult brain. also, mir_ <dig>  expressed at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, is predicted to target the prdm <dig> and zgc: <dig> genes which play important roles in embryonic axis specification, embryonic pectoral fin morphogenesis, regulation of neuron specification, regulation of signal transduction and multicellular organism development  <cit> . the sec23b and myst <dig> genes which are involved in cartilage development were retrieved as putative targets of mir_ <dig>  which was also expressed during development. myst <dig>  regulates hox expression and segmental identity, including cartilage patterning  <cit> . finally, the gills specific mir_ <dig> is predicted to target the melk gene, which is also strongly expressed in the gills and is involved in erythrocyte development  <cit> .

zebrafish microrna star sequences
star sequences of mirnas  are difficult to detect by conventional methods due to their rapid turnover. however, high throughput sequencing retrieved many of them and revealed their relative abundance in different organisms  <cit> . our dna pyrosequencing approach identified  <dig> mirna* sequences:  <dig> were identified previously by cloning and sanger sequencing  <cit> ,  <dig> were identified in this pyrosequencing study, but belong to known mirnas, and other  <dig> mirna* belong to the novel mirnas identified in this study. most star sequences retrieved fewer reads than the corresponding mature mirnas which is consistent with the mirna biogenesis model and strand selection by risc. however, six mirna* were more abundant than their corresponding mature mirnas, namely dre-mir-129*, dre-mir-140*, dre-mir-142a*, dre-mir-202*, dre-mir-210* and dre-mir-214*. similar results were observed before for dre-mir-129*, dre-mir-142a*, dre-mir-142b* and dre-mir-214*  <cit> . dre-mir-30e, dre-mir- <dig>  dre-mir- <dig> and dre-mir- <dig> showed similar strand-bias of both mature and star strands. since this was also observed in the chicken embryo for mir-30e and mir- <dig>  <cit>  and in drosophila melanogaster where several mirna* are present at physiologically relevant levels and associate with argonaute proteins, it is likely that both strands are loaded into risc and may guide target repression. finally, observed alterations in the ratio of expression of mature/star molecules suggests that some star molecules are functional and their activity may vary according to cellular context  <cit> . obviously, the biological function of these star sequences can only be unravelled through experimental testing, but their high number of reads suggests their inclusion in future zf mirna chips and expression profiling studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this study increased the total number of zf mirnas from  <dig> to  <dig> and showed that mirna cdna libraries prepared from different developmental stages and from adult tissues is an effective methodology for mirna discovery using low cost dna pyrosequencing mini-chips. the methodology permitted quantitative and qualitative analysis of mirna expression throughout the zf life cycle, as the mirna profile was largely in agreement with qrt-pcr and sanger sequencing data. most of the  <dig> novel mirnas were non-conserved low abundance molecules and their targets indicated that they might be involved in developmental processes. novel mirna star sequences were also identified and some of them were more abundant than their corresponding mature mirnas, suggesting that they may also be loaded into risc and may be functional. future deep sequencing studies may still identify additional mirnas in zf, however such mirnas may be expressed at very low levels or in specific physiological or pathological conditions.
