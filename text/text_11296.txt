BACKGROUND
analysis of personal genome sequence variation data is currently dominated by single-nucleotide variant  and small insertion and deletion  detection. such variants are easily visualized, relatively straightforward to detect, and have driven many successful studies of the associations between genomic variation and human disease  <cit> . larger variants, however, account for a greater number of variable bases in the genome, with up to 13% of the human genome subject to such variation  <cit> . these structural variants  include copy-number variants , copy-number neutral inversions, mobile element insertions , deletions, translocations, and complex combinations of these events. given their scope, it is unsurprising that svs have been implicated in a broad variety of diseases and are thought to contribute greatly to human genetic and phenotypic diversity  <cit> . nevertheless, structural variation remains less understood and more challenging to detect and characterize than snvs and smaller indels, both across populations and in personal genomes. as whole-genome sequencing  becomes increasingly employed as a research and molecular diagnostic tool, complete and accurate characterization of human genomic variation, including svs, will be essential to informing clinical decision making.

cnvs, as represented by deviations from the normal diploid state, are the most thoroughly studied class of svs, with extensive evidence for their role in human health and disease  <cit> . when encompassing genic regions, cnvs can alter the dosage and regulation of their constituent genes, while non-genic cnvs can affect the expression of proximal genes  <cit> . moreover, genic cnvs can contribute to recessive carrier states  <cit>  or bring about disease in combination with snvs on alleles in trans  <cit> . however, the resolution of cnv loci derived from array-based data is limited by probe density. read-depth analysis of whole-exome sequence  data has proven comparable to array-based cnv detection methods, but wes cnv calls still lack base-pair resolution of breakpoint junctions  <cit> . high-resolution sv breakpoint determination is necessary to understanding the disruptive  effects of svs when their breakpoints fall within functional genomic elements  <cit> , to identifying “mutational signatures” of sv formation mechanisms  <cit> , and to obtain both orientation and genomic positional information for cnv gains.

the availability of ngs data has resulted in a menagerie of sv-detection tools reflecting the broad size range, diversity, and complexity of svs  <cit> . these sv-detection methods are often limited by algorithm design, by the underlying data, and restricted to analysis of svs of a certain type, location, or size. recent efforts to address these limitations integrate multiple methods  to identify consensus svs  <cit> . while such consensus sv callers possess the ability to accommodate various data types and input formats, they are largely designed to call svs from the most ubiquitous type of sequence data, paired-end  reads, which are generally shorter  than most svs.

the challenges of sv detection are exacerbated by the lack of a “gold standard” description of structural variation within a personal genome—a reference diploid genome does not exist. here we combine pe and acgh data with long-read, long-insert, and whole-genome architecture data from a single individual  to improve the scope, resolution, and reliability of sv identification in a personal genome. these data are analyzed via established and newly developed sv discovery tools and then merged and evaluated within parliament, a sv detection infrastructure designed for multiple data sources and discovery methods. the constituent hs <dig> data, the resulting set of sv calls, and the parliament infrastructure are publicly available for local download and on the cloud-based service dnanexus, allowing users to compare novel methods to this analysis of hs <dig> and readily analyze other data without extensive local compute resources or software expertise.

RESULTS
hs <dig> svs
to provide a robust characterization of structural variation in a human personal genome, we examined multiple data sources from a single individual . this individual has been previously analyzed with acgh data and by whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, revealing novel sh3tc <dig> snvs causative for the subject’s autosomal recessive charcot-marie-tooth  neuropathy  <cit> .

pe sequence and acgh data were combined with long-read, long-insert size, and genome architecture data to describe the structural variation in the hs <dig> genome. table  <dig> summarizes the previously collected whole-genome data for hs <dig> and the new data specific to this study: a  <dig>  million probe acgh assay, 10x pacific biosciences  long-read coverage, an illumina nextera long-insert library , and 51x coverage by bionano irys single-molecule data. in aggregate, these data represent ~ <dig> billion sequenced nucleotides  and  <dig>  million acgh probes covering the hs <dig> genome. these technologies and their corresponding sv information were next integrated using parliament, a novel analysis infrastructure . the sv-detection methods employed by parliament identify regions of a subject’s genome that are inconsistent with a reference haploid genome assembly. these inconsistencies either can arise from true variation between the subject and reference or else are artifacts of ambiguous mapping between the subject’s reads and reference data.table  <dig>

the parliament discovery step identified  <dig>  initial events in the size range of 100 bp to  <dig> mbp that reduced to  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci, spanning  <dig> % of the hs <dig> genome. to distinguish between structural variants and mapping artifacts, we performed local hybrid assembly with the short- and long-read data . local hybrid assembly supported  <dig>  loci, that is, at least one assembled contig supported the predicted sv at a given locus. recognizing the limitations of local assembly, we then identified  <dig>  unassembled loci with support from different technologies and  <dig> unassembled loci with support from only one technology  that are spanned by at least one pacbio read consistent with the predicted sv. in total, these  <dig>  svs had an aggregate length of approximately  <dig> mbp that span  <dig> mbp of the reference genome . table  <dig> summarizes the performance of each data source and discovery method that contributes to the hs <dig> svs. the utility of the multi-source approach is immediately apparent, with single data types contributing  <dig> %  of the svs. pbhoney, developed specifically to identify svs from long-read pacbio data  <cit> , alone discovered  <dig>  svs with assembly support, indicating the importance of read length when characterizing structural variation. additional file 1: table s <dig> provides a complete summary of all  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci, which include the  <dig>  parliament svs and  <dig>  unsupported loci.table  <dig>

descriptions and results for each sv-detection method are provided. bionano irys data was used only for corroboration, not initial discovery, owing to its large size and propensity to span multiple events.



the hs <dig> svs comprised  <dig>  deletions,  <dig>  insertions, and  <dig> inversion events. figure  <dig> compares the size distributions of hs <dig> deletions and insertions with those reported in other personal genomes  <cit> . the hs <dig> distributions exhibit peaks at ~300 bp, a characteristic of alu transposon dimorphisms  <cit> . we assessed all hs <dig> events larger than  <dig> kbp by manually examining the irys architecture data in the corresponding regions. the irys data were consistent with  <dig> events ranging from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. given the resolution and nature of the irys data, it is unlikely that a large insertion or deletion would not manifest itself in the genomic architecture.figure  <dig> size distribution. all hs <dig> sv events larger than 100 bp and less than  <dig>  bp were compared to events from the venter genome  and an asian male , both specifically characterized for sv content. in this size regime, the hs <dig>  huref, and yh samples contain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> deletions  and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> insertions , respectively. the yh sv distributions are based on de novo assembly of 35 bp single-end and paired end data. this assembly was used to identify svs between 1 bp and  <dig> kbp. initial events larger than 50 bp were filtered using discordant paired-end mapping of ~35 bp reads. given the relative abundance of hs <dig> sequence data , and given the differences in methods, it is unlikely that the ~3-fold difference in insertions between the yh set and the hs <dig> and huref sets represents a significant lack of parliament sensitivity.



sv corroboration
parliament’s integration of multiple data sources and local hybrid assembly provides a systematic assessment of the sv calls made by each program. each of the  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci was assessed based on three support characteristics, each with a corresponding bit value: assembly support , multi-source support , and long-read force calling . these bit values represent an ordinal prioritization of support types. combining these bit values for each locus results in a bitflag between 0– <dig>  which provides a compact, extensible, and easily parsed representation of all possible support type combinations. for example, a locus with no support would have a  <dig> bitflag, while a locus with both assembly and multi-source support would have a bitflag of  <dig> . the  <dig>  svs comprised all loci with non-zero bitflags. to further understand these svs, we compared them to known dgv events, runs of homozygous snv calls, and acgh data in a family trio. figure  <dig> illustrates that of the  <dig>  hs <dig> svs,  <dig>  matched to a dgv event. the remaining  <dig>  hs <dig> svs that did not match a dgv entry reflect either previously uncharacterized svs or the low resolution of many dgv events. thus, as with snvs  <cit> , many svs in a personal genome represent rare or private variants not observed in databases  <cit> . we also identified  <dig>  unsupported loci that match with dgv events. while these events may correspond to potential hs <dig> false negative svs, they may also be the result of common mapping artifacts represented as variants in dgv or incidental overlap of the dgv events, which cover 70% of the human genome.figure  <dig> dgv comparison. each of the  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci was characterized as either an hs <dig> sv or unsupported locus based on its parliament bitflag and as either “in dgv” or “not dgv” based on whether it shared at least 50% reciprocal overlap with a dgv event of the same type.



we next compared the deletion calls to snvs identified based on wgs illumina sequencing data by using runs of homozygous snvs as proxy  for deleted regions. homozscore refers to the fraction of homozygous snvs in a deleted region . we focused on deletions within autosomes that encompassed five or more snvs. figure  <dig> indicates that the supported sv set  is enriched for deletions consistent with snv data. for deletions in this supported set that have average coverage less than 25x, we identified 59%  with homozscore > <dig> . in contrast, for the unsupported  deletions only 18%  have a homozscore > <dig> , reflecting identification of false positive deletion calls. to provide context for the homozscore, we identified those hs <dig> deletions that share 90% reciprocal overlap with a high-confidence set of population deletions from the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . of these  <dig> deletions,  <dig> have a homozscore >  <dig> .figure  <dig> snp concordance. homozscores are reported for three classes of hs <dig> deletion loci: unsupported loci, hs <dig> svs with less than 25x coverage, hs <dig> svs with greater than 50x coverage.



to further assess deletion detection and assembly accuracy, we experimentally validated  <dig> deletions that were amenable to long-range pcr and sequencing. these deletions had an average size of  <dig>  kbp , calculated from exact breakpoints determined by sanger sequencing. the average difference between the sanger and parliament breakpoints for these events was 44 bp, and the median difference was 2 bp . these values may be subject to alignment ambiguities caused by repeat-mediated breakpoints or microhomology generated by rearrangement mechanisms such as fork stalling template switching  or microhomology mediated break induced replication   <cit> . for example, our largest deviation was  <dig>  bp for an event mediated by two l1pa5-l <dig> repeats with 90% identical sequence. we used the same  <dig> pcr assays to perform family-based analyses using acgh data from the subject’s parents  <cit> . of these  <dig>  all were confirmed in at least one parent and  <dig> are found in both , indicating no de novo mutations in this small subset.

exonic sv content
we investigated whether svs were enriched in exonic regions, limiting this analysis to events smaller than  <dig> kbp to avoid large-event bias. the  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci include  <dig>  loci less than  <dig> kbp that span  <dig> ,602 bp of the genome . of these loci,  <dig>  cover  <dig> ,515 bp of  <dig>  exons . similarly,  <dig>  of the supported svs are less than  <dig> kbp, spanning  <dig> ,826 bp . of these svs,  <dig> span  <dig>  bp of  <dig>  exons . these similar values do not suggest exonic enrichment for either the reference-inconsistent loci or the hs <dig> svs. table  <dig> lists all genes with exons intersecting an assembly-supported sv  that is not found in dgv. a full list of exons overlapping svs is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig>

multi-source comparison
to further elucidate the impact of long-read data on sv detection, we developed a parallel illumina workflow  that uses only illumina hiseq pe data for both sv discovery and local assembly evaluation. this workflow  identified  <dig>  reference-inconsistent loci,  <dig>  of which were supported by local illumina-only assembly. we then assessed each of the  <dig>  illonly loci with local illumina/pacbio hybrid assembly support. the illonly parliament workflow was  <dig> % accurate,  <dig> % specific, and  <dig> % sensitive, with  <dig>  of the  <dig>  illonly svs supported by hybrid assembly . we also recovered  <dig>  svs that lacked illonly assembly support but were supported by hybrid assembly . table  <dig> compares the false-discovery rates  and sensitivities of each illumina hiseq sv method and the parliament illonly workflow. parliament is the only method with less than 10% fdr and greater than 50% sensitivity. despite these benefits of a multi-algorithm approach, illumina-only discovery still only recovers approximately half of the  <dig>  svs identified by multi-source parliament: pbhoney alone identifies  <dig>  svs supported by hybrid assembly, representing events “invisible” to pe data.figure  <dig> illumina-only & pacbio comparison. the illumina only results are compared to the hs <dig> sv subset containing illumina and pacbio discovery. pb-ill contains all hs <dig> svs with pacbio or illumina discovery and hybrid assembly support. the illhyb workflow uses only pe methods for discovery but both illumina and pacbio sequence reads for local assembly. the illonly workflow uses only illumina pe methods and reads for both discovery and assembly.

performance for each illumina-only method is summarized. supported and unsupported columns indicate the number of calls with and without local hybrid assembly support, respectively. false discovery rate  and sensitivity are calculated using all  <dig>  illumina only reference inconsistent loci and the subset of  <dig>  that are supported by hybrid assembly.



figure  <dig> illustrates the performance of all source-pair combinations relative to hybrid assembly and dgv events. calls supported by only one data source are represented on the diagonals, which indicate that such events were both less likely to match a dgv event or have assembly support. all acgh events, solo or paired, were more likely than other event types to have a dgv match, despite no clear preference in the assembly data. this disparity is likely a combination of the challenges associated with assembling larger events identified by acgh and the prevalence of such calls in dgv.figure  <dig> multi-source comparison. each cell contains the number of clusters with support from a pair of sources. the diagonal entries describe clusters with support with exactly one data source.



parliament on dnanexus
implementation of parliament on local compute requires independent installation of multiple discovery tools and a local assembler, imposing a burden of systems administration and resource consumption. we therefore installed the suite on a cloud-based service via dnanexus, a commercial middle-ware provider. in this implementation, users need only to upload their data, select the desired tools, and adjust parliament parameters. currently, dnanexus supports a full version of parliament as well as a lightweight bam-to-sv workflow that requires only illumina paired-end wgs data.

all hs <dig> data used in this study and the full result set are also available on dnanexus to facilitate software development and benchmarking. these data and the parliament infrastructure compose a publicly available resource for developers wishing to evaluate novel sv detection methods in a scalable environment . users can either upload their hs <dig> result set in parliament format or create a dnanexus app to run a newly developed program directly in the parliament workflow. in either case, parliament will update the hs <dig> reference-inconsistent loci with the novel events and reassemble any new or modified loci with the illumina and pacbio data, reporting the novel method’s performance relative to the existing data set.

discussion
previous single genome analyses have used combinations of array, unpaired short-read, and pe data to identify large variants  <cit> . a diploid de novo assembly of a single individual  identified  <dig> ,407 bp that are structurally variable when compared to the version  <dig> human genome reference assembly  <cit> . however, subsequent application of sv detection methods to array and pe data identified an additional  <dig> , <dig> structurally variant base pairs that, when compared to other genomic characterizations, suggest the limitations of assembly, pe data, and array based sv-detection methods  <cit> .

as the number of personal genomes increases in the clinical setting, overcoming the limitations of sv discovery will be critical for diagnosing genetic disease. even with the variety of methods and depth of data applied here to hs <dig>  resolving svs in a personal genome remains a challenge. while parliament was designed to provide the most comprehensive set of svs for a genome given all available data, the hs <dig> results also point the way forward to a gold standard sv set. figure  <dig> indicates that many assembly-supported calls are made only from short-read or long-read methods, lacking multi-source support. inspection of several of these events indicates that short- and long-read mappability and long-read coverage could account for some single-source discovery of hs <dig> svs . to further refine the hs <dig> svs, future parliament analysis will incorporate additional short- and long-read coverage and short-read libraries of varying insert sizes. these additional data will allow us to better distinguish method-based inaccuracies from the limitations of the data themselves, identify optimal data characteristics for sv discovery, and better characterize existing svs .

array-based calls present a different set of challenges, as acgh provides neither orientation nor positional information, but rather reports a value relative to a control and thus can identify cnvs but not copy-number neutral svs such as inversions. moreover, a relative gain in a subject could correspond to a loss in the control genome. finally, gains reported by acgh do not specify the exact location of those gains, only the portion of the genome that shows the relative gain; clinical acgh and fish studies reveal insertional translocations occur 160x more frequently than previously thought  <cit> . to characterize gains, these duplicated regions would have to be compared to all possible insertion location to confirm the nature of the event. future work will include incorporating such non-local variant annotation, which will also improve the size estimates of events represented as distant breakpoints.

development of such variant annotation will also include improved resolution of complex genomic rearrangements   <cit> . figure  <dig> describes a cgr in hs <dig> identified by pe-only methods as separate events. manual examination of the macaque  and chimpanzee  genomes revealed that the organization of this syntenic locus was similar to that reconstructed from hs <dig>  in the chimpanzee genome a large gap encompasses the relative position of the deletion event. examination of a fosmid mapping resource available for hg <dig>  <cit>  shows that  <dig> of  <dig> genomes contain deletion, inversion, and insertion fosmids at this locus. therefore, the rearrangement found in hs <dig> may be the common allele, or the hg <dig> reference may represent an erroneous sequence at this locus.figure  <dig> complex rearrangement. a representation of a large-scale deletion and inverted insertion rearrangement on chromosome  <dig> p <dig>  is depicted. through de novo assembly, the rearrangement breakpoint junctions  were identified, and the resultant structure in the genome of hs <dig> was found to be as depicted. below are shown the junction sequences of the three breakpoints.



while further refinement of the hs <dig> data will increase the specificity of the sv set, it is unlikely that high-throughput personal genome sv characterizations will have access to all the hs <dig> data types. as with snvs, we can enrich for svs of interest by incorporating corroborating data, such as family data, runs of homozygosity, and phenotype-specific gene lists. with this in mind, our illumina-only sv detection workflow built within the parliament prioritizes putative sv events based on the degree of support  rather than assigning a threshold for “truth.” such prioritization is particularly appropriate for svs considering that any sv with purported clinical impact will likely undergo manual curation or orthogonal validation. moreover, as reported here, applying multiple technologies and methods to a personal genome still only reveals the tens of thousands of reference-inconsistent loci that could indicate the presence of structural variation. while the calls made by different illumina hiseq methods largely overlap, there are  <dig>  hs <dig> svs identified by only one method, more than 10% of the total events . considering the millions of potential snvs whole genome data yield and the desire to recover potentially rare and complex events, sv detection methods can afford to err on the side of sensitivity.

the parliament workflows described here were designed for single-sample analysis of hs <dig>  but the parliament infrastructure is amenable to multi-source data. by customizing the rules for reducing and merging the input data, parliament can subtract calls common to multiple samples to create tumor-normal or trio analysis parliament workflows. given large sample sets, the parliament discovery step can be performed in parallel on each sample, merging the resultant calls into a “master list” of sites that can be assessed via local assembly in each sample, providing a project-level summary of structural variation across the cohort.

CONCLUSIONS
decreasing sequencing costs, a diversity of resequencing technologies, and increased availability of powerful computational resources provide an immediate opportunity to examine a broader class of genomic variation beyond snvs in the exome. the present work identifies upper  and lower  estimates of the extent of structural variation in a personal genome and characterizes the impact of various resequencing methods. applying multiple parliament workflows, we demonstrate that while method integration is optimal for sv detection in illumina paired-end data, the addition of long-read data can more than triple the number of svs detectable in a personal genome. the  <dig>  svs identified from the hs <dig> data sources represent the first long-read characterization of structural variation in a diploid human personal genome. moreover, the hs <dig> genome is particularly applicable to the challenges facing sv characterization, not for its specific sv content but because of the diversity of data and the ability to collect even more data as new technologies arise. the hs <dig> data and the parliament infrastructure are available via dnanexus, lowering barriers to evaluate new sv-detection methods. in turn, each method evaluated via parliament in this data commons further refines the hs <dig> sv data set—improving the desired gold standard characterization of svs in a personal diploid human genome.
