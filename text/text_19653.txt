BACKGROUND
attenuated strains of bacillus anthracis have played a major role in the development of vaccines and our understanding of anthrax. early work by pasteur and greenfield  <cit>  capitalized upon strains missing one of the mega-plasmids , which resulted in attenuation. this enabled the development of the first bacterial disease to be prevented through the use of an attenuated live vaccine. this early work was improved by sterne  <cit>  through the development of an attenuated strain missing the second mega-plasmid , but retaining the toxin producing genes on pxo <dig> as antigens for immune response. in recent years, avirulent strains have been subjected to extensive dna sequencing to understand these plasmids, their virulence genes and to generate hypotheses for attenuation mechanisms  <cit> . conversely b. cereus strains that have acquired the known b. anthracis mega-plasmids and anthrax-like virulence properties remain an enigma and are also worthy of further study to understand how this pathogen interacts with its host  <cit> .

an isolate from the centers for disease control  originally identified as b. megaterium, cdc 684/nrrl-349s/nrs  <dig> , was being used as an avirulent outgroup control in experiments with b. anthracis  <cit> . however, this particular isolate shares key phenotypic traits with b. anthracis such as non-hemolytic on blood agar, production of protective antigen and the poly-d-glutamic acid capsule, and sensitivity to gamma bacteriophage. because these features are all hallmark phenotypes for b. anthracis, ezzell et al.  <cit>  reclassified this isolate as b. anthracis despite the observation that cdc  <dig> did not react with monoclonal antibodies to a specific polysaccharide present in b. anthracis. subsequent animal testing of this isolate showed it to be severely attenuated in guinea pigs, in contrast to wild-type b. anthracis . however, the underlying mechanism behind this attenuated virulence phenotype remained unknown. the advent of massively parallel whole genome sequencing  provides an opportunity to examine the complete genetic component of cdc  <dig> for clues that might bear on this problem.

this report provides a description of the wgs, assembly and annotation of the b. anthracis cdc  <dig> isolate. we include analysis that: a) demonstrates that the genome of cdc  <dig> belongs to a specific b. anthracis clade; b) identifies  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  that are unique to the genome of this isolate; c) describes the details of a large chromosomal inversion; d) demonstrates that cdc  <dig> has altered growth kinetics in culture and e) proposes two alternative and testable hypotheses that could explain the attenuated phenotype for cdc  <dig> 

RESULTS
attenuation of cdc 684
the discovery that cdc  <dig> was not a b. megaterium strain but was rather b. anthracis, based on shared phenotypic features, prompted the use of the guinea pig model to determine its virulence. in a pilot experiment, groups of four guinea pigs injected i.m. with cdc  <dig> spores at doses of  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  cfu/ml survived. these groups were then injected four days later with  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml, respectively, and again all survived. by comparison these identical spore preparation and treatment conditions produced ld <dig> values for the virulent ames and vollum-1b strains of  <dig> and  <dig> spores respectively in the guinea pig model  <cit> .

this lack of lethality indicated that cdc  <dig> is significantly attenuated. in a second experiment to confirm attenuation,  <dig> guinea pigs injected i.m. with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml cdc  <dig> spores all survived. these results confirm that cdc  <dig> is highly attenuated with an ld <dig> of > <dig> ×  <dig> spores in the guinea pig model.

wgs of cdc 684
the cdc  <dig> genome has been recently sequenced and assembled to closure at los alamos national laboratory/j. craig venter institute and is available on the ncbi genome database . the chromosome is  <dig> , <dig> bp, pxo <dig>  is  <dig>  bp and pxo <dig>  is  <dig>  bp.

phylogenetic placement of cdc 684
the use of comparative wgs defined an extremely conserved and accurate phylogenetic snp tree for b. anthracis based on the analysis of  <dig>  snps in  <dig> diverse isolates  <cit> . this analysis resulted in the hypothesis that only a few selected snps at key positions along five branches were needed to accurately place all b. anthracis isolates into one of  <dig> sub-clades. this notion was shown to be accurate when  <dig> cansnps were subsequently used to accurately place more than  <dig>  b. anthracis isolates into one of these  <dig> sub-clades  <cit> . in silico cansnp typing showed that cdc  <dig> falls along the lineage created by b. anthracis vollum . this sequenced vollum strain is presumed to be a close relative of the british isolate that was tested as a biological weapon on gruinard island, scotland, in the 1940s  <cit> .

the close phylogenetic relationship between cdc  <dig> and vollum demonstrates that cdc  <dig> belongs to a highly virulent b. anthracis lineage. we were therefore interested in further determining the degree of relatedness between vollum and cdc  <dig>  given the marked differences in virulence between these two strains. an initial comparative in silico analysis of ames ancestor , cdc  <dig> and vollum wgs uncovered ~  <dig> snp differences distinct from ames ancestor but common  in both the cdc  <dig> and vollum genomes. these results are consistent with other whole genome snp comparisons of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates that suggest that the snp genetic distance between ames and vollum is approximately  <dig> snps .

preliminary analysis of  <dig> snps that phylogenetically reside along a terminal position on the vollum branch indicated that there were at least  <dig> new nodes along this branch, of which > <dig> vollum-like isolates reside . in silico analysis of  <dig> new cansnps along this branch indicated that cdc  <dig> was not in the terminal node created by the sequenced vollum strain, but rather was located in a node midway between the sequenced strain and a branch point defined by the initial analysis of  <dig> vollum-like strains, figure  <dig> 

cdc specific snps
this analysis also demonstrated that cdc  <dig> possessed  <dig> snps that appeared to be unique to this isolate. there were  <dig> isolates that shared the vollum branch node with cdc  <dig>  these isolates were predominantly recovered by the centers for disease control during the 1950s and 1960s. while the incidence of lethal anthrax infections in the united states had been greatly reduced during the 20th century  <cit> , it can be assumed that the majority of the cdc isolates labeled as b. anthracis would have come from sources containing virulent strains such as imported hides and/or animal deaths  <cit> .

sequence variations between the virulence plasmids
the simplest explanation for the attenuated phenotype for cdc <dig> would be the mutation of one or more of the virulence factors encoded on the pxo <dig> or pxo <dig> plasmids that altered expression or function. these virulence factors include the toxin gene complex on pxo <dig> , the poly-d-glutamyl capsule gene complex on pxo <dig> , and trans-acting transcription regulators on both plasmids  <cit> . however, in silico comparison of the completed sequences of the pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> plasmids from the cdc  <dig> strain to those of the ames ancestor and vollum strains showed that all of the known virulence factors were intact. there was a single non-synonymous snp found in pxo <dig> gbaa_pxo1_ <dig>  a large gene of unknown function. collectively we observed no putative functional differences in the plasmid-encoded virulence factors between cdc  <dig> and its closest relative, vollum, which is a fully virulent strain  <cit> .

large chromosomal inversion in cdc 684
the most striking feature of cdc  <dig> genome is a massive inversion that reverses the orientation of  <dig>  mbp of the chromosome relative to the replication origin. the dimensions of the inversion have been graphically illustrated in a recent review of bacillus anthracis genome variation  <cit> . this earlier report used artemis software http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/ to illustrate the alignment and conserved gene order of four finished and closed genomes . while the fine-scale gene order in cdc  <dig> is precisely maintained as in the ames chromosome, the large rearrangement has caused an inversion of a  <dig>  mbp region between the basepair coordinates  <dig> kbp and  <dig>  kbp in the ames ancestor chromosome .

the inversion appears to have been caused by an internal recombination event between homologous regions within two lysogenic lambda-like prophages , which are found in all b. anthracis genomes  <cit> . the inversion can best be visualized at the molecular level by examining the orientation of the att  sites that flank the ends of these phages . lysogenic bacteriophages possess cohesive ends , usually 12- <dig> bp repeats, which serve as both excision points and "sticky ends" that enable the phage to cirularize as it enters a lytic life cycle  <cit> . at first glance it seemed likely that the inversion may involve the att sites in these lambda like prophages and that the exchange may have involved a site-specific recombination. but the two att sites were unique to each other, i.e., lambda ba <dig> and ba <dig> contain distinct att sites  that allow them to be distinguished from each other tttacac). in ames ancestor, pairs of these two distinct att sites define both the size  and boundaries of each prophage. in cdc  <dig> , the external att sites  are in relatively identical chromosomal positions to those in the ames ancestor. however, the internal att sites  have dramatically exchanged positions between these genomes. in cdc  <dig>  the right att site  for lambdaba <dig> has moved to the left att position of lambda ba <dig>  and likewise the left att site for lambda ba <dig>  has moved to the position occupied by right att site in lambda ba <dig>  the net effect of this exchange is the creation of new hybrid prophages in cdc  <dig> . these observations indicate that the large inversion event did not involve site-directed recombination but rather a homologous recombination event in the interior of both prophages.

molecular detection of the inversion in other b. anthracis strains
a pcr approach was designed to detect the inversion sites in cdc  <dig> as a method that could test for the presence of the inversion in other isolates. because of its size, the inversion is readily visible in the closed genome, but the molecular nature of the inversion is dependent on the proper alignment of two short regions  during the assembly of this genome. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the 5' end of each of the rep sequences are distinct from each another and their positions are fixed at approximately the same positions in both genomes. however, the 3' end of the rep genes are highly homologous, with scattered snps the only distinguishing feature between these paralogs.

due to constraints on pcr amplicon size we used mismatch amplification mutation assays  to discriminate between the right and left ends of the large inversion in cdc  <dig> and ames ancestor. the rationale was to demonstrate the different ends of the inverted  <dig>  mbp fragment in cdc  <dig> by use of real time pcr assays. the mama system was designed to take advantage of polymorphic differences that characterize the left and right snp signatures within the rep lambda-like protein sequences relative to the ames ancestor genome. both the left and right assay systems have common primers  that are fixed because they are external to the  <dig>  mbp inversion site. the internal primers are nearly identical but they target mismatches at specific snp sites; g on the left site and a on the right site of the ames genome. these same internal primers  cannot amplify the same  <dig> and  <dig> bp products in cdc  <dig> because they are separated by  <dig>  mbp. but the reciprocal pairings of the internal primers do amplify products from cdc  <dig> 

where cp = common primer; inv = inversion; f = forward; r = reverse

these mama were used to analyze several isolates within the vollum branch. in addition, the snps flanking the inversion were compared to in silico analysis of other b. anthracis wgs to determine the configuration of this  <dig>  mbp region in other non-vollum strains. table  <dig> illustrates that only the cdc  <dig> isolate possessed the inverted genotype from among  <dig> genomes examined, indicating the inversion is not common in b. anthracis.

defining the dif site in b. anthracis
in e. coli the large ter region has been found to contain a specific substrate sequence, dif , which is used by two recombinases, xerc and xerd, to resolve chromosomal multi-mers and to allow daughter chromosomes to segregate before cell division  <cit> . it has been proposed that the dif site  is in fact a more likely site of termination than any specific ter sites for both the e. coli and b. subtilis chromosomes  <cit> . from the perspective of the cdc  <dig> genome, the dif sites in both γ-proteobacteria and firmicutes appear to have an extremely close association with the maximum gc-skew in those genomes that have been analyzed  <cit> .

dif sites have been defined in both b. subtilis  <cit>  and a member of b. cereus sub-group  <cit> . a cursory survey of the palindrome from the b. subtilis and b. cereus dif site  in the ames ancestor identified a 28-bp palindromic sequence  <cit>  that is located at nearly the precise genomic site of the cumulative gc-skew. this sequence is conserved and positioned at the cumulative ~ 180° gc-skew position of every complete whole genome sequence in all of the genbank entries for the b. cereus sub-group . the one exception is the genome of cdc  <dig> where the conserved dif-like sequence and the gc-skew are oriented at ~ 120° in relationship to the origin of replication .

growth kinetics of cdc  <dig> versus wild type b. anthracis
the significant difference in the spatial orientation of the ori site and dif/gc skew sites in cdc  <dig> suggests that there could be an alteration in how the bi-directional replication of chromosome would proceed because of the unequal distances the opposite leading strands would need to travel. because accumulated evidence indicates that genomes like those of e. coli and bacillus sp do not tolerate significant changes between the spatial orientation of the ori and ter sites, we designed a growth experiment to compare the growth kinetics of cdc  <dig> to those of three wild type b. anthracis strains.

growth curves for four strains of bacillus anthracis: ames, ba_a <dig> , vollum and cdc  <dig> were grown in lb broth at 37°c . these cultures were grown in duplicate  or triplicate  with growth measured by od <dig>  the strains represent two major phylogenetic groups of b. anthracis. note the relatively consistent growth curves for the three wild type isolates: ames, ba a <dig> and vollum, the closest relative to cdc  <dig>  two obvious differences between the cdc  <dig> and vollum growth curves is a longer lag phase and slower mid log growth rate in cdc  <dig>  these differences were noted despite careful efforts to exactly match inoculum sizes using direct plating viability counts. an extended lag phase would suggest that cdc  <dig> takes longer to adapt to the inoculum transfer process and/or to conditions necessary for growth and cell division. the slower mid log growth rate  in this experiment suggests that even after revival from lag phase that cdc  <dig> has a cellular limitation to growth that does not exist in the wild type strains. these results provide a growth parameter that implies that the spatial change in the orientation of the origin of replication and the termination site in cdc  <dig> may have altered the growth of this isolate.

discussion
by phylogenetic, molecular and clinical criteria, cdc  <dig> is a b. anthracis and its attenuated phenotype must be due to differences within its genome relative to those of other closely related b. anthracis strains. the marked degree of attenuation of cdc  <dig>   compares with ld <dig> values of  <dig> and  <dig> spores reported for the virulent ames and vollum-1b strains  <cit> . it therefore renders a comparative genomics approach highly informative and suggests that either subtle snp differences and/or a dramatic and massive inversion within this chromosome are responsible for the attenuation.

whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis indicates that there are  <dig> chromosomal and <  <dig> plasmid snp that are unique to cdc  <dig> in a comparison to vollum. the possibility that one or more of these rare snps may have an important role in the attenuation of cdc  <dig> remains a viable option. these data have defined a new cdc  <dig> lineage emanating from the original vollum branch, figure  <dig>  twenty-seven of these snps would be translated into non-synonymous mutations in putative gene functions. none of these snps, however, are in genes considered to be virulence factors found in opportunistic b. cereus pathogens that include a variety of hemolysins, non-hemolytic enterotoxins, monomeric entertoxins and phospholipases  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> snps include  <dig> synonymous snps,  <dig> snps in pseudogenes, and  <dig> intra-genic snps. only one of these intra-genic snps is located in a region within a promoter region  in a l-serine dehydratase gene .

what has not been excluded from this new lineage are  <dig> b. anthracis isolates that currently share the nodal position between the cdc  <dig> and vollum lineages . a sequencing effort to identify cdc  <dig> specific snp that are either shared or still unique among the presumably virulent  <dig> isolates would point to phenotype altering snp. any chromosomal and plasmid snp that are still unique to cdc  <dig> would be candidates for having positions in genes or regulatory regions with roles that govern known or unknown functions that are necessary in a virulent organism. there is, as yet, no clear notion whether or how any of these snps could cause the dramatic change in the virulence or growth properties of cdc  <dig> 

the role of the chromosome of b. anthracis in the overall etiology of the disease anthrax is still poorly understood. it is becoming evident that the regulatory functions of the virulent plasmids  work in concert with certain chromosomal regulatory functions in a virulent organism, e.g. the regulation of the pxo <dig> atxa gene by chromosomal sigma factors or plasmid genes involved in a signal-transduction pathway that inhibits sporulation  <cit> . these and other recent studies  <cit>  make it difficult to dismiss any of the cdc  <dig> non-synonymous mutations as candidates for a role in the attenuated phenotype without further analysis.

an alternative hypothesis to explain the attenuation of cdc  <dig> is a role for the large  <dig>  mbp inversion within its chromosome. while this inversion does not appear to have altered the fine-scale order of the individual genes, it has changed the orientation of the genes within the inversion with respect to the genes outside of the inversion. this change in the orientation has been illustrated by whole genome alignments  <cit>  and by an analysis of the gc skewing and the location of dif sites of the cdc  <dig> genome and that of several b. anthracis and b. cereus sub-group isolates . these analyses indicate that the spatial relationship between the origin of replication and the termination of replication in cdc  <dig> has been perturbed by the massive inversion. the comparative growth data  clearly supports the idea that chromosomal replication may be altered in cdc  <dig> by exhibiting an extended lag phase and a longer growth rate.

the longer dna synthesis time needed to complete chromosomal replication may be sufficient, alone, to explain the slower cellular growth rate of cdc  <dig>  in the asymmetrical cdc  <dig> chromosome, the longer leading strand distance is  <dig>  mbp vs.  <dig>  mbp for vollum and all characterized wild type b. anthracis strains. this is a ~38% larger chromosomal distance to replicate and, assuming everything else remains constant, this will take that much longer to complete the entire chromosome. the mid log doubling time difference between the wild type strains  and cdc  <dig>  is ~45%. the similarity between the 38% long replication distance and 45% longer growth rate is striking. this observation suggests that the displaced ter region remains the site for replication termination and that the asymetrical longer leading strand replication distance in cdc  <dig> becomes limiting for growth in vitro.

historical accounts suggest that there are strong tendencies to conserve the basic relationship between the position of the ori and ter sites in enteric bacteria  <cit> . following the discovery of the dif sites and related specific recombinases, it was proposed that the topological relationship between the ori and the ter/dif site must be maintained at 0° and 180°, respectively, for normal chromosomal segregation to occur  <cit> . this was suggested because mutations in the xer recombinase genes or the dif site or the displacement of the dif site to other regions of the chromosome had adverse effects on cell division.

more recently whole genome sequence comparisons between several distinct species also suggest that there is conservation in the spatial orientation between the ori and ter sites over broad groups of bacteria  <cit> . dot plots of conserved dna and protein sequences between pairs of species produce characteristic x-shaped patterns suggesting that large chromosomal rearrangements often revolve around and maintain the distances between the origin and the terminus.

this study illustrates a case where the naturally conserved 180° orientation of the ori and ter sites has been modified by a large chromosomal inversion in a strain of b. anthracis, cdc  <dig>  we suggest that the consequence of the altered spatial relationship between the ori and ter sites from 180° to 120° has caused the change in growth kinetics of this isolate . we also suggest that this change appears to alter the length of time that cdc  <dig> takes to replicates its chromosome. whether this change has also altered the virulent phenotype of this isolate is yet to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
we address two hypotheses that could have a role for the attenuated phenotype in b. anthracis cdc  <dig>  the first is that a single chromosomal point mutation may have altered a function that is crucial to normal growth and virulence in b. anthracis.

despite evidence for a wide array of chromosomal rearrangements in the b. cereus subgroup  <cit> , blast searches conducted using the dif region of bacillus anthracis and b. cereus also indicate a trend towards maintaining a nearly 180° spatial relationship between the ori/dif sites . the second hypothesis, therefore, suggests that major alterations of this relationship are possibly not tolerated by b. anthracis when under natural ecological pressures. the existence of an isolate like cdc  <dig> demonstrates that a moderate skewing in the spatial relationship between the ori /dif may be overcome in terms of sheer growth and survivorship in the laboratory. but we suggest that the potential biological consequences of altered dna replication and/or dna expression rendered by this change may have resulted in an altered phenotype for successful pathogenicity in a mammalian host. both kinds of "genetic alterations" can be expected to be rare in b. anthracis since these organisms would not have a selective advantage in a natural environment and would be difficult to find.
