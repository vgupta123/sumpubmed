BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human respiratory pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections such as pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome . it is estimated that each year more than  <dig> million deaths are attributed to s. pneumoniae infection worldwide  <cit> . furthermore, since  <dig> antimicrobial resistance has been escalating in s. pneumoniae  <cit> , resulting in difficulties in the treatment of pneumococcal infections. antimicrobial resistance of s. pneumoniae is associated with increasing incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases in children as well as clinical failures of antimicrobial treatment  <cit> . although the 7-valent conjugate vaccine has been shown highly efficacious in the prevention of invasive diseases caused by vaccine serotypes  <cit> , the emergence of non-vaccine serotype infections has occurred  <cit> , bringing new challenges to the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.

hus is a rare but severe complication of infectious diseases. the majority of hus cases are associated with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli; however, hus associated with invasive s. pneumoniae infection has been increasingly reported over the years, always with a high mortality and long-term morbidity  <cit> . among the vaccine-preventable serotypes of s. pneumoniae, serotype  <dig> is often invasive, as evidenced by its high predilection to cause necrotizing pneumonia and other devastating complications, including hus  <cit> . in the pre-vaccine era, serotype  <dig> was one of the most common serotypes of s. pneumoniae that caused invasive pneumococcal diseases worldwide  <cit> . moreover, serotype  <dig> often expresses resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, including penicillin, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone. to date, four complete genome sequences of s. pneumoniae are available in public database, including two laboratory strains , one avirulent strain  and one multidrug-resistant strain   <cit> . furthermore, a total of twelve draft sequences have been published recently  <cit> . these pneumococcal genomes provide us a good opportunity to undertake comprehensive comparative studies on the virulence and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of this microorganism. we described here the features of s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> genome and the changes of the genome structure and contents compared with other pneumococcal genomes. the diversity and dynamics of the distributed genome of s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig>  especially the mobile genetic elements carrying a number of virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants, are highlighted.

RESULTS
general genome features
the single circular chromosome of strain cgsp <dig> contains  <dig> , <dig> bp with a g + c content of  <dig> % . the sequence of the genome has been deposited in the genbank database . base pair one of this chromosome was assigned within the putative origin of replication. the genome has  <dig> trnas,  <dig> rrnas and  <dig> structural rnas, including  <dig> rrna operons. biological roles were assigned to 67% of the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding sequences , according to the classification scheme adapted from riley  <cit> . seventy-nine percent of the coding sequences were transcribed in the same orientation as dna replication, a feature that appears to be common in other low gc gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the replication termination site is localized near  <dig>  megabase pairs by gc skew analysis. this region is located almost exactly opposite the origin of replication on the chromosome . the genome includes  <dig> pseudogenes, the majority of which are is elements and hypothetical proteins.

previous studies showed that the s. pneumoniae genome is rich in is elements, which make up more of the genome than of any other bacterial genomes sequenced to date  <cit> . in the cgsp <dig> genome we identified  <dig> is elements . the majority of the is elements appeared to be degenerate due to insertions, deletions, or point mutations, and only twelve were intact in cgsp <dig> genome. although these degenerate is elements might be inactive and non-functional, they could provide the potential sites for homologous recombination to acquire novel genes from related species.

comparative genomic analysis
comparative analysis of cgsp <dig> genome with four complete genomes and twelve draft pneumococcal genomes  provided new insights into the rapid evolution of the pneumococcal genome. s. pneumoniae, as with other bacterial pathogens, possesses a conserved core genome with interspersing regions of small and large scale differences . in total,  <dig>  orthologous genes were shared by the seventeen pneumococcal genomes . by searching the orthologous genes against cog database, 36% were found to be metabolism-related, 36% were associated with other known functions, 16% had poorly characterized functions, and 12% had no hits in the cog database and encoded mainly hypothetical proteins . in addition, we found cgsp <dig> shared the largest number of orthologous genes  with strains spn23f and spninv <dig> among the sixteen strains used for comparative genomic analysis, indicating that the cgsp <dig> genome shows highest homology to the two sequenced strains.

the genes on the distributed genomes were further analyzed. alignment analysis revealed that at least eight distributed clusters were present in cgsp <dig> genome; most of the genes were related to virulence or antimicrobial resistance. these include a lantibiotic synthesis gene cluster, the capsular locus, a large cell wall surface anchor protein, two transposons, a resistance island, a possible phage remnant and a gene cluster with unknown functions. meanwhile, we displayed the genome-wide gc content in figure  <dig>  all the eight clusters had deviated gc content, suggesting they could be recent acquisitions through horizontal gene transfer  in cgsp <dig>  the distribution of the eight gene clusters among the seventeen pneumococcal genomes was shown in table  <dig>  particularly, the two conjugative transposons were found to be unique in the cgsp <dig> genome.

alignment analysis indicated that chromosomal rearrangements occurred in s. pneumoniae . compared with other published pneumococcal genomes, chromosomal inversions were identified in cgsp <dig> genome. a 189-kb inversion occurred across the replication termination site . chromosomal inversion across the replication axis usually is believed to rebalance the unbalanced chromosomal architecture caused by the insertion of large dna segments  <cit> . in the cgsp <dig> genome, we found that most of the acquired-dna segments , mainly composed of transposons and is elements, resided in left of the replication axis . these observations suggested that the integration of transposons and is elements affected the balance of the chromosomal architecture. this imbalance might cause the chromosomal inversion in cgsp <dig>  this inversion led to transfer of  <dig> genes from the left to the right of the replication axis. besides, a 19-kb inversion  was observed in cgsp <dig> relative to tigr <dig>  g <dig>  and inv <dig>  while the gene order in this 19-kb segment is consistent to inv <dig>  the gene cluster is not intact in other pneumococcal genomes. further analysis showed that the four rearrangement breakpoints were located within the is elements. through chromosomal rearrangements, s. pneumoniae evolved to maintain genome stability after hgt that might confer genes necessary for the organism to survive or replicate in its environmental niche.

antimicrobial resistance genes
cgsp <dig> is resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents. the antimicrobial resistance determinants among the seventeen penumococcal strains were compared and listed in additional file  <dig>  cgsp <dig> contained  <dig> antimicrobial resistance determinants, while the number of antimicrobial resistance determinants in other strains varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  nearly half of the antimicrobial resistance determinants in cgsp <dig> were associated with mobile genetic elements.

the genome contained two large conjugative transoposons, which were found as composite elements of the known transposons. the first one containing  <dig> open reading frames , was a 68-kb conjugative transposon . since this transposon had never been described previously, we named it tn <dig>  a novel conjugative transposon. sequence analysis indicated that tn <dig> was a composite of three transposons. a 50-kb dna segment carrying chloramphenicol resistance gene  could be an independent conjugative transposon and at left terminus of this transposon, two orfs were designated as intergrase and relaxase required for transposition. the sequences of the orfs within this transposon were highly homologous to those of tn <dig>  which have been reported in s. pneumoniae before  <cit> . the tn5252-like transposon was split into a 46-kb proximal region and a 4-kb distal region after the insertion of a 13-kb segment. the insertion appeared in the same position in spn23f, which contained a 81-kb conjugative transposon  <cit> . the 13-kb insertion was identified as another independent transposon, which also owned the intergrase and excisionase at the right terminus for independent transposition; this transposon carried  <dig> genes coding for erythromycin, streptothricin and kanamycin resistance, a feature similar to the known tn <dig>  <cit> . another 5-kb segment, as an insertion in the 13-kb transposon, resembled the transposon tn <dig>  <cit> , which contained  <dig> orfs, encoding erythromycin resistance protein , resolvase and transposase. overall, this novel conjugative transposon, a composite of three transposons, carried  <dig> antimicrobial resistance genes.

the other 23-kb conjugative transposon in cgsp <dig> contained  <dig> orfs . sequence analysis demonstrated that this transposon was also a composite of two transposons. an 18-kb dna segment carrying a tetracycline resistance gene  could be an independent transposon, which contained two orfs encoding for intergrase and excisase; this transposon shows high similarity to the transposon tn <dig>   <cit> . another 5-kb segment carrying an erythromycin resistance gene , as an insertion, was identified as tn917-like transposon. the structure of this composite transposon, i.e., a tn917-like transposon inserted by a tn <dig> transposon, resembled that of tn <dig>  the structure of tn <dig> has been described in s. pneumoniae  <cit> ; thus, this 23-kb conjugative transposon was defined as a tn3872-like transposon.

among the seventeen published s. pneumoniae genomes, an 81-kb conjugative transposon and a 67-kb conjugative transposon also appeared in the genomes of spn23f and g <dig>  respectively. the two conjugative transposons were both composed of a tn916-like transposon and a tn5252-like transposon  <cit> , similar to tn <dig> in cgsp <dig>  however, comparative analysis suggested that genetic variations occured among the three conjugative transposons . in cgsp <dig> and spn23f, the tn5252-like transposons carry a chloramphenicol resistance gene, which seems missing in g <dig>  and is replaced by an abc-type antimicrobial peptide transport system. the tn916-like transposon in spn23f carries a tetracycline resistance gene, and in g <dig>  it carries a tetracycline resistance gene and an erythromycin resistance gene. in contrast, the tn916-like element of tn <dig> in cgsp <dig> lost the locus encoding the tetracycline resistance gene, while a dna segment encoding three antimicrobial resistance genes, a transcriptional repressor and a tn917-like transposon was inserted into this position. the variation of antimicrobial resistance determinants in the three conjugative transposons showed that the conjugative transposons have experienced frequent recombination and deletion events after the tn916-like element integrated into the larger conjugative transposon, probably due to different selective pressures.

in addition to the two conjugative transposons carrying antimicrobial resistance genes, we identified a  <dig> -kb genomic region , which appeared to be a resistance island in cgsp <dig>  the  <dig> -kb region carried a chloramphenicol resistance gene  and a gene encoding methionyl-trna synthetase  <dig> . further analysis showed that the island shared an average g+c content of  <dig> %, much lower than the average of the genome . this island contained several genes associated with genome instability, including one site-specific recombinase and multiple is elements which might be responsible for the lateral transfer of the genomic region. furthermore, the associated orfs had diverse phylogenetic origin . based on these features, we deemed the  <dig> -kb region as a resistance island; to our knowledge, this was for the first time described in s. pneumoniae. this  <dig> -kb resistance island was also seen in the draft genomes of cgssp14bs <dig>  cgssp19bs <dig>  cgssp9bs <dig> and spninv <dig>  blast results showed that the sequences in this island showed high identity to each other. the comparison between cgsp <dig> and spninv <dig> was demonstrated in figure  <dig>  since this island carried two antimicrobial resistance genes, the presence of this resistance island may be associated with the increased multidrug resistance of these strains.

distinct from the characterized antimicrobial resistance determinants associated with mobile genetic elements in cgsp <dig>  there were several chromosome-encoded determinants that also contributed to antimicrobial resistance. these included a tellurite resistance protein , a bacitracin resistance protein , a cadmium resistance transporter , a multidrug resistance efflux pump , two β-lactam resistance factors , and three metallo-β-lactamases.

penicillin-binding proteins
penicillin-resistant pneumococci are prevalent throughout the world. one mechanism conferring penicillin nonsusceptibility is alterations of penicillin-binding proteins . alterations in pbp genes result in reduced affinity for penicillin and other β-lactams. five high-molecular-weight pbp genes  dispersed in s. pneumoniae. among the five genes, highly variable pbp2x, pbp1a, and pbp2b are considered most important in antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . by allele assignments of the three pbp genes in the seventeen penumococcal genomes, cgsp <dig> had the most variable pbp2x, pbp1a, and pbp2b. although the sequence variations of these pbp genes in cgsp <dig> differed from two other strains of serotype  <dig> , they were almost identical to those of the strain spn23f, suggesting that pbp2x, pbp1a, and pbp2b genes probably had gone through frequent homologous recombination between serotypes  <dig> and 23f.

virulence genes
the polysaccharide capsule is the principal pneumococcal virulence determinant. s. pneumoniae are divided into  <dig> serotypes depending on different capsular structures. studies suggested that certain serotypes have a greater potential to cause invasive disease than others  <cit> . the clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae in asia are largely confined to a limited number of serotypes, namely 6b, 9v,  <dig>  19f, and 23f  <cit> . in cgsp <dig> genome, a  <dig> -kb gene cluster  was identified to be involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide, flanked by two is elements on each side, either truncated or disrupted, which were remnants of is <dig> and is <dig>  respectively. compared to strain  <dig> of serotype  <dig> and strain spninv <dig> for which the capsular locus was determined  <cit> , the capsular locus of cgsp <dig> differed at 3' end . the gene wciy was divided into two orfs  in cgsp <dig>  this gene was unique in serotype  <dig>  but its function was unknown. however, a previous study showed that the disruption of this gene did not affect capsular production  <cit> . besides, the orf  immediately downstream of these two genes in cgsp <dig> was found to contain a deletion of  <dig> units of a 306-bp tandem repeat, compared with the corresponding genes in strain  <dig> and spninv <dig>  the gene belonged to the surface anchored protein family but its function also remained unclear. with the exception of these two genes, other genes in the capsular locus were almost identical among the three strains of serotype  <dig>  <cit> . as has been described  <cit> , serotype  <dig> utilized the wzx/wzy-dependent pathway to synthesize their capsular polysaccharide .

in addition to the capsule, s. pneumoniae produced a number of other virulence factors, such as pneumolysin, hydrogen peroxide and cell surface proteins  <cit> . according to how they are linked to the cell surface, the surface proteins of s. pneumoniae are divided into three families: choline-binding proteins, lpxtg-anchored proteins, and lipoproteins  <cit> . surface proteins of cgsp <dig> based on computer prediction are shown in additional file  <dig> 

several members of the choline-binding protein family are known to be important for virulence, including the autolysin , choline binding protein a , and pneumococcal surface protein a . pspc is involved in the adhesion of bacteria to the nasopharynx  <cit> . pspa is a highly variable protein and involved in inhibition of complement activation  <cit> . choline binding protein pcpa is postulated to be an adhesin because it contains leucine-rich repeats  <cit> . the seventeen penumococcal genomes all harbored one copy of these virulence determinants, while cgsp <dig> and sp19-bs <dig> both obtained another copy of pspa and pcpa due to a 7-kb-long dna insertion adjacent to a remnant transposase. the  <dig> kb sequences in cgsp <dig> and sp19-bs <dig> showed high identity to each other.

proteins that contain the lpxtg amino acid motif are common in most gram-positive bacteria. the lpxtg motif near to the carboxyl terminal of the protein is recognized and linked to the cell wall by a sortase enzyme  <cit> . neuraminidase is one of the lpxtg-anchored proteins. neuraminidase cleaves n-acetylneuraminic acid from oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids and is viewed as a virulence factor in microbial pathogenesis  <cit> . analysis of the available genome sequences of s. pneumoniae indicated that this microorganism had at least three neuraminidases  <cit> . all the three neuraminidases are present in cgsp <dig>  both nana and nanb are present in all the other sixteen penumococcal strains, while nanc is present only in eight. the presence of nanc might be associated with the increased virulence of some strains of s. pneumoniae. zinc metalloprotease is also a member of lpxtg-anchored protein family. from the published genome sequences of s. pneumoniae, four zinc metalloproteases were discovered. cgsp <dig> contained three of them, including iga, zmpb and zmpd. zinc metalloproteinases belong to a group of hypervariable surface proteins, the hypervariability of these proteins are due to frequent hgt in these regions, enabling antigenic escape  <cit> .

besides these common virulence proteins, one unusual protein in lpxtg-anchored proteins family was found. the gene, spcg <dig>  encoded a 4695-animo acid protein, containing  <dig> imperfect repeats of the amino acid motif sasasast. this surface protein shows homology to sp <dig>  in tigr <dig>  the surface protein is located in the vicinity of nine glycosyl transferases in cgsp <dig>  all of which are present on a  <dig> -kb segment flanked by two is elements. the  <dig> -kb region seems to be an insertion in cgsp <dig> and tigr <dig> due to hgt, as this region has not been found in other genomes.

lantibiotics are peptide antibiotics with high antimicrobial activity against several gram-positive bacteria. they are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified  <cit> . in cgsp <dig>  we identified a  <dig> -kb locus encoding three proteins related to lantibiotic biosynthesis: a lantibiotic dehydratase, a lantibiotic synthetase and a lantibiotic efflux protein, nearby a transcriptional regulator . by a thorough search against other sixteen genomes, this gene cluster shows high similarity to the corresponding locus in the genome of another serotype  <dig> strain spninv <dig>  recent studies reported that the strains sp23-bs <dig> and spn23f of serotype  <dig> also contained lantibiotic synthesis gene clusters  <cit> ; however, comparative analysis indicated that they showed no sequence similarity to those found in cgsp <dig> and spninv <dig>  furthermore, we performed a blast search against the nr database, and found the locus in the serotype <dig> has a high similarity  to that in streptococcus thermophilus. therefore, this locus in the serotype  <dig> might encode a new type of lantibiotic, different from those found in the serotype  <dig>  this finding suggests that communication of virulence genes has occurred among different species of streptococci.

what drives the genome evolution?
in this study, we further analyzed  <dig> clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig>  all from sterile sites, by multilocus sequence typing , in addition to cgsp <dig>  which belonged to st <dig>  the most common sequence type was st <dig> , followed by st <dig>  and st <dig>  . only one st <dig> was identified among the  <dig> isolates. st <dig> and st <dig> were prevalent in taiwan, while both st <dig> and st <dig> belonged to variants of the international england <dig> clone . capsular switching could have occurred between serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> and between serotype  <dig> and serogroup  <dig>  as we found two isolates  were st <dig>  st <dig> has been identified in serotypes  <dig>  9a, and 9v. all the clinical serotype  <dig> isolates, expressed different levels of penicillin and ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility , which is in accord with the data published recently  <cit> . this finding indicates that higher competence and plasticity of the genome likely afforded an advantage to pneumococcal strains to become more and more antimicrobial-resistant, and again supports that virulent clones might evolve to be more resistant in order to survive in the drug environment. given the fact, to reduce the selective pressure, judicious use of antibiotics should never be overemphasized.

discussion
a bacterial pathogen can be described by its "supragenome", which is composed of a "core genome" and an "distributed genome"  <cit> . in general, the core genome includes all genes responsible for the basic aspects of the biology of a species and its major phenotypic traits. in contrast, distributed genomes constitute to the species diversity and might encode supplementary biochemical pathways and functions not essential for bacterial growth but which confer selective advantages, such as adaptation to different niches and antimicrobial resistance. in this study, we added a complete genome to the pneumococcal supragenome. the analysis of distributed genome of cgsp <dig> indicates that pneumococcal supragenome is still open and evolving.

comparative analysis showed that gene communications occurred frequently among different strains of s. pneumoniae and among different species of the streptococcus genus by hgt, which has been demonstrated as a major force to drive bacterial evolution  <cit> . s. pneumoniae is able to efficiently acquire genetic materials from the large gene pool of the environment by means of transformation, transduction, and conjugation. we found that at the genome level, cgsp <dig> acquired at least eight foreign dna elements from other organisms by hgt, as these blocks demonstrated deviation in the gc content. in sequence analysis, the genes encoded in these newly acquired elements may enhance the pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance of cgsp <dig> 

in cgsp <dig> genome, a remarkable feature is horizontal acquisition of two conjugative transposons and one genomic island. the three previously un-described mobile elements totally carried eight antimicrobial resistance genes, which promote the adaptation of organism to an environment with high drug pressure. besides, most of the other accessory dna elements were flanked by is elements; for instance, the capsular locus, the predominant virulence determinant of s. pneumoniae, was a mobile genetic element flanked by is elements. the dynamics of these mobile elements might attribute to the clinically important phenotypic shift in s. pneumonae.

invasive pneumococcal disease cases due to serotypes included in the 7-valent vaccine continued to fall in the usa, but the overall invasive pneumococcal disease rate leveled off starting in  <dig>  largely due to an increase in cases caused by serotype 19a, which is not covered by the 7-valent vaccine  <cit> . given these trends, development of expanded-valency polysaccharide vaccines or ideally, a universal protein vaccine, is mandatory. it has been shown that in the case of s. agalactiae, the design of such vaccine was only possible using virulence-related dispensable genes  <cit> . to this end, sequencing of multiple genomes from s. pneumoniae to better probe the diversity of the pathogen and its pathogenic features is necessary and certainly will continue to surprise us with fascinating discoveries in the evolution of s. pneumoniae and impact on the clinical medicine.

CONCLUSIONS
streptococcus pneumoniae serotype  <dig> is one of the most invasive among >  <dig> pneumococcal serotypes, often causing life-threatening invasive pneumococcal diseases in humans. s. pneumoniae has been evolving rapidly over time, resulting in a large amount of genetic diversity, despite the constraints imposed by the small genome size and complex genetic organization of the genome. in this study, we sequenced the entire genome of a serotype  <dig> clinical isolate , and carried out comprehensive comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. we found that the genome evolution of s. pneumoniae is driven largely by the host adaptations. in addition to horizontal gene transfer, recombination, which re-balanced the genome structure after events of gene loss or addition, also appears to be an important element in s. pneumoniae evolution. human intervention in the form of mass vaccination and antimicrobial treatment reduced the burden of pneumococcal diseases, but has already accelerated the evolution of the pneumococcal genome. we conclude that such evolution results in a more virulent and antimicrobial-resistant s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig>
