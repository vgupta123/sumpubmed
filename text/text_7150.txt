BACKGROUND
tools for assessing genetic diversity in malaria parasites are of potential use for the discovery of novel malaria vaccine antigens  <cit> , and for understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance . recent advances in genome sequencing technology offer high-throughput methods for obtaining full genomic data  <cit> . however, these technologies still require relatively large quantities of high quality dna. microarrays are able to tolerate dna of lower quantity and quality typical of patient-derived field samples, which contain far more human than parasite dna. thus, field samples unsuitable for full-genome sequencing may be amenable to microarray analysis. microarrays can also be adapted to incorporate new loci, determine copy number polymorphism or designed to answer specific research questions.

microarrays have been developed for genotyping plasmodium falciparum, using a variety of platforms that detect single nucleotide polymorphisms  at loci that had been described at the time of platform design . many novel snps were discovered in a large scale p. falciparum sequencing project, resulting in a map of population genomic variation  <cit> . we sought to create a microarray that would be able to genotype highly informative loci within this genomic map in field samples that were not amenable to next-generation sequencing. we also wanted a high-throughput system capable of working with dna extracted from low volume blood samples. we chose to use a custom nimblegen  <dig>  million probe design in multi-plex format. this platform is comprised of  <dig> identical arrays on one slide, each capable of genotyping  <dig>  loci within the p. falciparum genome. when dual-color labeling is used, two samples can be hybridized to a single array yielding  <dig>  snps for  <dig> samples in a single 2-day experiment, where several such slides can be run simultaneously, making this approach relatively high-throughput and inexpensive.

RESULTS
heuristic base calling
to test the accuracy of this microarray we genotyped cultured parasites of the 3d <dig> reference strain, simulating varying levels of parasitemia by dilution into whole blood and using various pre- and post-extraction processing of the dna. a previous p. falciparum array using the same nimblegen technology used a snp-calling algorithm referred to as the d-score method  <cit> . applied to the new array, this approach provided an average of >92% accuracy for samples with  <dig>  or more parasites/μl. however, samples with low parasitemia  yielded very poor accuracy . investigation of this inaccuracy identified a strong bias toward g and c snp calls in lower parasitemia samples . the cause of this bias is most likely a lack of probe saturation in low dna quantity samples and inflated intensities due to a higher binding affinity of the triple hydrogen bonding of guanine to cytosine. the d-score method relies entirely on raw intensity values to call snps, without regard to the base composition of the probe . many microarrays do not rely on raw intensity values to make base calls, and in some instances a complex model is fitted to the data to accurately call snps  <cit> . to overcome this bias a heuristic algorithm was developed which uses the probe center base position to adjust raw intensity values . when applied to the samples described above, this new algorithm gave accuracies greater than 95% in nearly all samples tested.table  <dig>

to test the accuracy and call rate of the new heuristic algorithm cultured 3d <dig> strain parasites were genotyped under differing leukocyte depletion, whole-genome amplification, and parasite concentrations. we then compared the previously describe d-score method to the heuristic algorithm. .
sample intensities and intensity distributions of varying center bases. a) distribution of raw probe intensities. dotted lines indicate global mean intensity values for t  and g  center position alleles. b) average raw intensities of a single snp for  <dig> field samples. dotted lines indicate area of low contrast where points between the lines would not be distinguishable. black points were called a t allele by genome sequencing and green diamonds were called a g allele. c) average intensities after global mean adjustment, all sequenced calls match microarray calls after running through algorithm.



this algorithm uses the global array average for probes with identical center positions to adjust individual probe intensities. a call is made only when the sense and antisense base match, a contrast between alleles of  <dig>  exists, and all intensities are greater than the random binding threshold. this heuristic algorithm outperformed the d-score method in the mixing experiment of cultured 3d <dig> parasites raising the average accuracy of these samples to >98% and increasing the accuracy of the  <dig>  parasites/μl by as much as 25%. we also observed an increase in snp call rates when using this heuristic algorithm.

to set more accurate sample quality control  thresholds we switched from the initial approach of measuring dna quantity in terms of parasites/μl to a quantitative pcr  method. for the previous microarray a dna quantify cutoff of 250 ng was used to select samples for testing, but lower input amounts were not systematically evaluated  <cit> . adopting the new heuristic algorithm and using 152–219 ng dna from the nf <dig> parasite lab strain quantified using 18 s qpcr, we observed an average snp-calling accuracy of  <dig> % . to identify the lower limits of dna quantity we tested a range of 1–40 ng purified dna from 3d <dig> and dd <dig> parasites, obtaining >95% accuracy down to 20 ng of parasite dna for 3d <dig> and down to 10 ng for dd <dig>  calculation of call rates for all samples revealed a wide range  which was associated with the amount of dna used  . for these samples there was also an association of dna quantity with call accuracy .table  <dig>

analysis of field isolates and leukocyte depletion
to assess the feasibility and accuracy of using dna from p. falciparum parasites extracted directly from patient blood we used both high and low parasite dna concentration samples derived from venous blood samples that had and had not been subjected to leukocyte depletion. high dna samples include  <dig> samples from southeast asia that had successfully undergone illumina whole-genome sequencing and had a parasite dna concentration of 250 ng. these samples had an average accuracy of  <dig> % and an average call rate of  <dig> % . low dna volume samples were seven samples from southeast asia that ranged from 206 ng down to 37 ng of parasite dna and averaged  <dig> % and  <dig> % accuracy and call rate respectively. there was no correlation between accuracy and dna quantity  , while there was a strong correlation   between dna quantity and call rate, demonstrating that dna quantity is a good predictor of the number of snps called. analyses were performed on all reference and field isolates tested to determine the per snp accuracy rate. among all  <dig>  snps typed by this array ~ <dig>  were called correctly in 100% of samples analyzed. only a small subset  was called incorrectly in all samples and ~ <dig> were not able to be called in any sample. only snps called correctly in >95% of samples were included in final versions of the heuristic base calling algorithm. distribution of inaccurate snps appears random through visual inspection of both their place within the genome and their layout on the printed array.figure  <dig>

we noted a difference for low volume samples that had undergone leukocyte depletion to remove human dna prior to dna extraction. leukocyte depletion removes human white blood cells from a whole blood sample, enriching the final sample for red blood cells which harbor the parasite and consequently their dna. in the analysis of cultured 3d <dig> parasites diluted in whole blood a subset of samples were leukocyte depleted using cf <dig> cellulose columns. for the  <dig>  parasites/μl samples we saw an average increase of accuracy of  <dig> % and an average increase in snp call rate of  <dig> % . this increase was more pronounced in non-whole genome amplified  samples.

effects of whole-genome amplification
samples with low dna quantity can be subjected to wga to increase the amount of dna, allowing more samples to pass preliminary qc metrics. several cultured and purified dna samples underwent wga prior to genotyping and were used to evaluate possible bias when undergoing amplification. accuracies in cultured parasites showed no marked difference  while wga slightly increased the call rate overall . two nf <dig> dna samples were subjected to wga prior to microarray analysis, yielding an average accuracy of  <dig> % and an average call rate of  <dig> %, about 10% higher than the non-wga samples .

discussion
we set out to develop a snp genotyping platform for use on p. falciparum field samples of low dna quantity and quality, and evaluated this tool using parasite dna from cultured parasites and preserved venous blood collected from malaria-infected individuals in field studies. an earlier microarray used 250 ng of dna as the minimum level tested, although lower dna quantities were not systematically evaluated  <cit> . our heuristic snp-calling algorithm was capable of accounting for a bias discovered when using lower quantity samples and yields highly accurate results for samples with as little as 37 ng of parasite dna in field samples and 10 ng in purified dna samples. we also obtained high accuracy with filter paper samples, albeit with lower reproducibility . addition of a wga step and a strict dna quantity threshold may improve reproducibility for filter paper blood spots.

dna microarrays have previously been used for snp detection in p. falciparum

. with the increased availability of whole genome sequence data thanks to lower costs and improved methodology, the value of dna microarrays can be questioned. however, for valuable field samples that are associated with important demographic, clinical and other phenotypic data such as drug resistance or vaccine resistance  <cit> , microarrays can rescue the high proportion of samples that fail to meet criteria for sequencing, justifying the use of microarrays. samples that often do not meet sequencing standards include low volume blood samples, filter paper blood spots, samples with high levels of human dna contamination, and archived or degraded samples. it was our goal to create a snp microarray that can complement genome sequence data in association and population genetics studies, providing genome-wide snp data for samples not fit for sequencing. the snps chosen were based on a set of highly validated loci identified by sequencing hundreds of global isolates of p. falciparum
 <cit> 
. this large sequencing project shows how microarrays still have a place in genomic research. the first iteration of samples prepared for sequencing had a qc pass rate of ~30%; more recent samples had a pass rate of >50%. this leaves a significant number of samples with no data. by selecting snps from within this highly validated list of loci we can fill in the gaps from sequencing while continuing to use samples for which sequencing was successful. the cost of genome-wide microarray analysis  compares favorably with that of genome sequencing . imputation strategies are being developed that may further increase the value of microarray-generated snp information.

CONCLUSIONS
this microarray genotypes over  <dig>  variable positions in the p. falciparum genome with high accuracy and high throughput. the ability to run samples with as little as 10 ng of parasite dna increases the number of field samples for which whole genome analysis is possible. the selection of loci also allows samples genotyped on this microarray to be analyzed in conjunction with higher quality samples sequenced using next-generation sequencing platforms.
