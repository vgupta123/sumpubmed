BACKGROUND
fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that are used widely to treat a variety of infections, such as gonococcal infections, osteomyelitis, enteric, and respiratory and urinary tract infections. ciprofloxacin  is one of the most consumed fluoroquinolones worldwide  <cit> . the type ii topoisomerases dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv are the target of quinolones  <cit> . dna gyrase is the preferential target in gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, whereas topoisomerase iv is affected mainly in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . these enzymes induce transient dna double-strand breaks  on bacterial chromosomes, which either introduce negative supercoiling, as in the case of dna gyrase, or relax supercoiling and decatenate-replicated daughter chromosomes, as in the case of topoisomerase iv  <cit> . dna gyrase is a tetramer with two gyra and two gyrb subunits, and topoisomerase iv comprises two parc and two pare subunits. after dsb induction, the topoisomerase passes through the dna duplex, seals the break, and releases dna. during this process, a transient covalent link is established between the gyra or the parc subunits and the 5' end of each dna break  <cit> .

quinolones bind rapidly to the dna topoisomerases attached to dna, producing ternary complexes comprising quinolone-topoisomerase-dna. these complexes promptly block dna replication and rna transcription, an action that inhibits cell growth but does not clearly explain the cell killing by quinolones  <cit> . after formation of the ternary complex, a dsb is produced by topoisomerase, but bound quinolone inhibits the subsequent ligation of the dna ends by trapping the topoisomerase on dna to the gyra or parc proteins through a covalent bond of the 5' ends. these products are called cleaved complexes and are distributed throughout the bacterial chromosome. when using first-generation quinolones such us nalidixic acid, dsbs are constrained initially by the proteins from the cleaved complexes, and this process can be reversed by removing the quinolone, adding edta, or mild heat treatment. cell killing is relatively slow, and the rate of killing seems to correlate with later massive chromosomal dna fragmentation mediated by a putative protein suicide factor, whose synthesis may be blocked by chloramphenicol. in contrast, a high concentration of fluoroquinolones such as cip or gatifloxacin produces rapid cell death and chromosomal dna fragmentation, processes that are not protected by chloramphenicol and thus are protein synthesis independent  <cit> . in this case, dsbs from the cleaved complexes behave as irreversible products possibly because of the drug-mediated dissociation of topoisomerase subunits, and the dna breaks are released from the protein constraint, thereby fragmenting the chromosome. bactericidal antibiotics, including the quinolone norfloxacin, may induce the production of hydroxyl radicals that can cause extensive oxidative cellular damage, including secondary dna injury, which may contribute to bacterial death  <cit> .

quinolone resistance results essentially from target modification caused by mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, especially in the quinolone resistance-determining region   <cit> . several mutations may coexist in the same or in different subunits and may produce high-level resistance. changes in drug permeation or overexpression of efflux pumps may also be involved and, in combination with qrdr mutations, may contribute to high-level resistance  <cit> . several recent studies indicate that target protection through plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance genes also may play a significant role, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide  <cit> . the existence of fluoroquinolone-inactivating enzymes, like a variant of the gene that encodes aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac-ib, has been proposed  <cit> . this enzyme variant would reduce the activity of both aminoglycosides and cip.

given the extended use of fluoroquinolones, especially cip, a more thorough understanding of their activity is needed. because chromosomal dna fragmentation is the main mechanism that correlates with cell killing  <cit> , it is the parameter of choice to assess fluoroquinolone activity. we have recently developed a kit that allows the simple and rapid assessment of the presence of fragmented dna at the single-cell level in micro-organisms  <cit> . cells immersed in an inert microgel on a slide are lysed, stained with a highly sensitive dna fluorochrome, and visualized with a fluorescence microscope. the nucleoids with fragmented dna are discriminated clearly by their peripheral halo of diffused dna fragments. the greater the fragmentation, the greater the number of dna spots and the greater the circular surface area of diffusion evident in this assay. here we show the significant technical value of our procedure for determining the activity of fluoroquinolones, particularly for detecting chromosomal dna damage and repair after cip treatment in e. coli.

methods
cultures
chromosomal dna fragmentation in situ was assayed in the tg <dig> e. coli strain, which was grown routinely in luria bertani  broth  or on lb agar at 37°c in aerobic conditions. e. coli tg <dig>  proab/supe  <dig> thi . cell growth in liquid cultures was evaluated by monitoring turbidity at od <dig> using a spectrophotometer . the minimum inhibitory concentration  was determined using the e-test  according to manufacturer's instructions. viability was determined by colony counting after sequential dilutions and plating. to determine the percentage of viable cells, the number of cells seeded on the plate was counted using a cytometric camera.

experiments
three different experiments were performed with tg <dig> e. coli, all in triplicate. typical experiments are presented. in the first, several colonies of tg <dig> e. coli were grown overnight on lb agar plates and then resuspended in lb broth at an od <dig> of  <dig>  and grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> . the colonies were then incubated with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig> μg/ml cip  in  <dig> ml falcon tubes containing  <dig> ml of lb broth for  <dig> min at 37°c with aeration and shaking, and then processed to measure the chromosomal dna fragmentation.

in the second experiment, tg <dig> e. coli was removed from culture in lb agar, resuspended in lb broth at an od <dig> of  <dig> , and treated with  <dig> μg/ml cip in lb broth at 37°c with aeration and shaking. aliquots were removed after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min of incubation, and processed to measure dna fragmentation. the time needed to prepare the microgel with the cells enclosed, before the slide was immersed in the lysing solution, was  <dig> min . in the results, this time must be added to each incubation period. to complete this experiment, tg <dig> e. coli were cultured in liquid lb broth at 37°c for  <dig> h with aeration and shaking, and the growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity . the liquid cultures started at an od <dig> of  <dig> . aliquots were removed during the exponentially growing phase at  <dig> h  and during the stationary phase at  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h . at the end of each designated time,  <dig> μg/ml of cip was added directly to the aliquot, and the aliquot was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> and  <dig> min, and then processed to measure the dna fragmentation.

in the third experiment, the micro-organisms were grown overnight on lb agar plates, resuspended in lb broth at an od <dig> of  <dig> , grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> , and then incubated with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/ml cip in lb broth for  <dig> min at 37°c. after the incubation, the cip was removed from the medium by centrifuging the bacteria and washing in plain lb broth. the bacteria were incubated at 37°c in lb broth with aeration and shaking, and aliquots were removed at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h. for the  <dig>  μg/ml dose of cip, the bacteria were also incubated for  <dig> h. one aliquot was used to measure the dna fragmentation, and another was plated on lb agar at 37°c to measure the viability after  <dig> h of culture. cultures without cip and with cip incorporated in the new lb medium added after washing after the initial cip treatment were included and processed along with each dose and for the various incubation times.

bacterial strains with low cip sensitivity
besides the experiments with tg <dig>  dna fragmentation was measured in four e. coli strains whose low sensitivity to cip and underlying mechanisms are known. these included strains with mutations in the qrdr region from gyra and parc  <cit> . the isolates were c- <dig> ;  <dig> , and  <dig> , and the control strain c- <dig> with no mutation in the qrdr region . the strain j <dig> with the plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance gene qnra <dig>  and its control strain j <dig> without the plasmid were also examined  <cit> . these strains were exposed to cip at the mic dose, at 10× and 100× the mic dose, and at  <dig> × and  <dig> × the mic dose for  <dig> min at 37°c in the exponentially growing phase, and dna fragmentation was determined.

determination of dna fragmentation
the micro-halomax® kit for fluorescence microscopy  was used. a thorough description has been published previously  <cit> . essentially, an aliquot of each sample was diluted to a concentration of 5– <dig> million micro-organisms/ml in lb medium. the kit includes  <dig>  ml snap cap microfuge tubes containing gelled aliquots of low-melting point agarose. the tube was placed in a water bath at 90–100°c for about  <dig> min to melt the agarose completely and then placed in a water bath at 37°c. twenty-five microlitres of the diluted sample was added to the tube and mixed with the melted agarose. a  <dig> μl aliquot of the sample-agarose mixture was pipetted onto a precoated slide, and the sample was covered with a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> mm coverslip. the slide was placed on a cold plate in the refrigerator  for  <dig> min to allow the agarose to produce a microgel with the trapped intact cells inside. the coverslip was removed gently, and the slide was immediately immersed horizontally in  <dig> ml of the lysing solution for  <dig> min at 37°c. the slide was washed horizontally in a tray with abundant distilled water for  <dig> min, dehydrated by incubating horizontally in cold  ethanol of increasing concentration  for  <dig> min each, and air-dried in an oven.

the dried slide was incubated in a microwave oven at  <dig> w for  <dig> min, and the dna was stained with  <dig> μl of the fluorochrome sybr gold  diluted 1: <dig> in tbe buffer  for  <dig> min in the dark.

images were viewed under an epifluorescence microscope , with a 100× objective and appropriate fluorescence filters, and the images were acquired using a high-sensitivity ccd camera . groups of 16-bit digital images were obtained at each experimental time under similar conditions and stored as tiff files. image analysis was performed using a macro designed with visilog  <dig>  software . this macro allows for thresholding and background subtraction, and delineates the circular area of diffusion of the dna fragments from nucleoids. the width delimitated between the edge of the nucleoid and the circumference that limits the circular peripheral area of spreading of dna fragments is the simplest parameter to estimate dna fragmentation level after cip treatment and was measured in μm. at each experimental time, 50– <dig> nucleoids were evaluated.

statistical analysis
because the data did not follow a normal distribution as ascertained by the kolmogorov-smirnov test, the non-parametric mann-whitney u test was performed to compare the groups. significance was defined as p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
dose response
the e. coli strain tg <dig>  was exposed to increasing doses of cip in liquid lb medium for  <dig> min at 37°c . doses less than the mic did not result is visible dna fragments, even after increasing the incubation time with the antibiotic to  <dig> min . the mic dose resulted in a clear effect: nucleoids appeared compact but with few peripheral dna fragments . as the dose increased, the number of dsbs increased gradually, which was reflected in progressively more dna fragments and their elevated surface showing peripheral diffusion from the nucleoid . after the  <dig>  μg/ml dose, all nucleoids appeared massively fragmented as small dna spots that diffused widely from their original place in the bacteria . the  <dig> μg/ml dose resulted in nucleoids that appeared similar to those obtained after  <dig>  μg/ml. the degree of fragmentation tended to be homogeneous after each dose, probably because of the relative similarity in the response to the antibiotic between the different bacteria. the dna fragments always appeared as small spots, independent of the dose.

the width of the dispersion of the fragments from the boundary of the nucleoid was quantified using an image analysis system; this measure is a simple and reliable quantitative parameter that reflects the level of cip-induced dna damage . differences were significant between the doses tested from  <dig>  μg/ml, except between  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, between  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, and between  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml. using the images obtained, the nucleoids were categorized into five classes of damage, as shown in fig.  <dig> and table 1: class 0: undamaged, dose of  <dig> to  <dig>  μg/ml ; class i: low damage level, dose of  <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/ml ; class ii: intermediate level, dose of  <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/ml ; class iii: high level, dose of  <dig>  μg/ml ; and class iv: massive fragmentation, doses of  <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml or higher . this latter class of damage was practically undistinguishable from that shown by nucleoids with extensive dna fragmentation always present spontaneously in cultures  <cit> . classification into classes is standard practice in mutagenesis studies and provides a perceptive description that is especially useful when heterogeneity in the dna damage rank is evident between the different nucleoids, as observed in the dna repair experiments.

the width of the halo of dispersion of dna fragments is presented in μm . the extent of dna damage was classified according to the width of the dispersion.

incubation time
to determine the minimum incubation time needed to detect a dna-breakage effect, the tg <dig> e. coli were collected from lb agar and exposed in liquid lb to  <dig> μg/ml cip for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min. the microgel preparation time before immersion in the lysing solution  must be added to these times because the antibiotic may enter the bacteria and act during this period. detectable but subtle damage was apparent after  <dig> min  ; this subtle damage appeared as nucleoids with some peripheral dna fragments unlike in the untreated control cells. as the incubation time increased, the level of dna damage increased progressively to class ii after  <dig>  min  and class iii after  <dig> min ; nucleoids appeared massively fragmented after  <dig> min  . as in the dose-response study, the dna damage intensity also tended to be homogeneous in the different nucleoids at each sample time.

the dna fragmentation level did not differ between bacteria incubated with the antibiotic at room temperature or at 37°c, or with or without agitation. interestingly, tg <dig> grown previously in lb broth instead of lb agar and tested in the exponentially growing phase produced the most dna fragmentation  after  <dig> min; i.e., immediately after the  <dig> min of microgel preparing.

to investigate why the dna damage level was dependent on the previous culture conditions, tg <dig> was grown in lb broth for  <dig> h, and the od <dig> was monitored. aliquots were removed after different culture times and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml cip for  <dig> and  <dig> min  . after  <dig> h of culture , all nucleoids were class iv after  <dig> and  <dig> min, as described above. after  <dig> h, the culture had achieved the stationary phase, and the nucleoids appeared mainly as class ii  and a few of them as class i after  <dig> min of incubation, whereas most  were class iv after  <dig> min. aliquots removed after  <dig> h  showed nucleoids as classes i  and  <dig>  after  <dig> min, and class iii  after  <dig> min incubation with cip. the same result occurred after  <dig> h of culture. this experiment suggests that the growing conditions influence the speed of the cip effect, which becomes increasingly slower when the bacteria are progressing into the stationary phase.

evolution of dna damage
the tg <dig> e. coli strain was exposed to three different doses of cip,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, for  <dig> min. after this treatment, the antibiotic was washed out, and the bacteria were incubated for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h .

after exposure to the highest dose , all nucleoids were extremely fragmented, i.e., class iv. the dsb repair was limited and clearly noticeable only after  <dig> h;  <dig> % of nucleoids were of class iii after  <dig> h. remarkably, all the nucleoids from the bacteria observed after  <dig> h showed massive fragmentation . viability was very low after  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> h, and zero after  <dig> and  <dig> h .

immediately after incubating with the  <dig> μg/ml dose, all nucleoids were class iv. a higher repair level was observed than after the highest dose, predominantly class iii  after  <dig> h, class i  after  <dig> h, and class i  after  <dig> h. apparently repaired nucleoids without diffusing dna fragments  were visualized after  <dig> h, and this increased to  <dig> % after  <dig> h. however, the viability was very low, as in the experiment with the highest dose .

in contrast to the results at the higher doses, repair activity was evident in the cultures exposed continuously to  <dig>  μg/ml of cip for the various times ;  <dig> % of nucleoids were class iii after  <dig> h, and 31% were class i and 31% class  <dig> after  <dig> h. this latter time was assessed further in this experiment. the frequency of class  <dig> increased from  <dig> % after  <dig> h to  <dig> % after  <dig> h. in all cases, viability was very low or zero. removing the drug resulted in faster repair kinetics, predominantly of class ii  after  <dig>  h and class  <dig>  after  <dig> h . the nucleoid pattern was similar to that of the untreated control cells after  <dig> h. viability was initially very low, 2–4% after 4– <dig> h, and increased to  <dig> % after  <dig> h . thus, we found no clear relationship between the extent of repair of cip-induced dna breakage and cell viability.

evaluation of strains with known mechanisms of low sensitivity to cip
the other e. coli strains used have been described previously  <cit> . they include strains with one amino acid substitution mutation in gyra , two substitution mutations in gyra , and two substitution mutations in gyra and another two in parc . the more mutations, the greater the resistance level, as reflected in the mic values . we also evaluated a strain with a qnra <dig> plasmid   <cit>  . doses lower than the mic never resulted in visible dna fragments. thus, in strains with a mic of  <dig>  μg/ml , the mic dose caused little dna fragmentation in all bacteria , whereas doses of 10× and 100× the mic caused massive dna fragmentation  . this behaviour is similar to that of the fully sensitive control strains but was shifted to a higher mic. the  <dig> strain did not show a clear effect at the mic dose  but appeared as class i after 10× and class ii after 100× of the mic dose . the  <dig> strain has a high mic  and showed no dna damage at any dose .

the level of fragmentation obtained by different cip doses is indicated by the width of the halo of dispersion of dna fragments and is measured in μm . mic is in μg/ml.

discussion
cip-induced chromosomal dna fragmentation was assayed in situ in e. coli using the micro-halomax® kit  <cit> . we grew the samples in lb agar because this is simpler and is used routinely in clinical microbiology laboratories. the sample is scratched, diluted in lb broth to an od <dig> of  <dig> , and incubated with cip in  <dig> ml of liquid lb in a  <dig> ml falcon tube at 37°c with aeration. incubation in a  <dig>  ml eppendorf tube with  <dig> μl of lb broth at room temperature  and without aeration does not modify the kinetics of dna fragmentation induced by  <dig> μg/ml of cip. we observed similar results in the tg <dig> strain and in three other e. coli-sensitive samples. further confirmation in other sensitive strains could simplify the protocol for assessing e. coli sensitivity or resistance to cip in the clinic.

incubating tg <dig> with cip for  <dig> min before technical processing produced a clear dose-response effect in chromosomal dna fragmentation, and the damage level was similar in the different nucleoids. the effect on dna was evident starting at the mic dose, and dna fragments were always visualized as spots of relatively small size, independently of the dose. the fragment size after oxolinic acid or norfloxacin treatment of e. coli has been estimated at  <dig> to  <dig> kb; i.e., the presumed size of the dna loops of the nucleoid  <cit> . our result suggests that the dna fragments liberated from the nucleoid are of fairly regular size and that more fragments are released as the cip dose increases. it also supports the possibility of clusters of preferential dna gyrase cleavage sites  <cit> . it is possible that doses smaller than the mic could induce a small amount of dsbs, which could be spaced widely in the different domains but not cause spreading of the fragments.

in our previous report, a cip dose of  <dig>  μg/ml produced slightly more damage than in the present study  <cit> . this is probably because of the harsher lysing conditions in our previous study, which may have caused additional dna damage. this was corrected in the conditions used in our current study.

adding  <dig> μg/ml of cip to tg <dig> in lb broth and instantaneous processing using our technique produced just barely detectable dna fragmentation. taking tg <dig> from lb agar reduces the extent of damage. dna damage increases progressively with incubation time, and a  <dig> min incubation is needed to achieve the maximum level of dna fragmentation. remarkably, when the bacteria came from exponentially growing cultures in lb broth, the highest dna fragmentation level was observed immediately . these results suggest that the cip effect on dna is cumulative with time and that its velocity is dependent on the growing conditions. we confirmed this hypothesis by analyzing aliquots removed periodically from a batch culture incubated with  <dig> μg/ml cip for  <dig> and  <dig> min. the dna fragmentation level declined progressively as the bacteria proceed into the stationary phase.

most e. coli cells divide uniformly in exponentially growing cultures but stop dividing when they achieve the stationary phase  <cit> . bacteria grown in lb agar should be heterogeneous with regard to the growing phase, both exponential and stationary. the mic is an average of the bacterial sensitivity to the antibiotic, which reflects the different effect of cip on dna. the dna fragmentation yield is homogeneous among the nucleoids in exponentially growing tg <dig> but is slower and tends to be more heterogeneous in the stationary phase. this greater heterogeneity was evident after short incubation with  <dig> μg/ml cip but tended to be homogeneous after  <dig> min of treatment.

pulse field gel electrophoresis shows that the norfloxacin-induced fragmentation in e. coli nucleoids is low in the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . this phenomenon could reflect decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, downregulation of topoisomerases, or a more tightly packed nucleoid structure as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy  <cit> . using our procedure, we have also observed more compacted nucleoids in the stationary phase. the most probable explanation is the activation of multidrug transporters that exclude fluoroquinolones, which is mediated by quorum-sensing signals. in fact, the quorum-sensing transcription factor sdia from e. coli is regulated in a density-dependent manner, and its overproduction upregulates acrab, which increases resistance to quinolones and other antibiotics  <cit> .

the lysing solution causes protein denaturation, so theoretically, the sensitivity-resistance assay is adequate to investigate sensitivity to fluoroquinolones at the relevant doses. cip-mediated dsbs are natively unconstrained and are considered irreversible and lethal. in the case of first-generation quinolones such as nalidixic acid, the technique would artificially unconstrain dsbs that are naturally confined in the cleaved complex. if so, both reversible non-lethal dsbs and later lethal unconstrained dsbs should be detected without but cannot be differentiated in the assay. addition of the chelating agent edta seems to reverse the cleaved complex formation by quinolones  <cit> , possibly because incubation with edta before lysis allows the resealing of the reversible dna breaks so that only the irreversible dsbs would be detected.

cip-induced dsbs were not totally irreversible, and a progressive repair activity with time was evident in tg <dig>  the magnitude of dna repair was inversely related to dose and was noticeable after a dose of  <dig>  μg/ml but scarce after a dose of  <dig> μg/ml. this repair was evident when the antibiotic was removed after the  <dig> min incubation and when tg <dig> was exposed continuously to the low dose  without cip removal. the progressive spontaneous cip degradation or inactivation with time in culture cannot be discounted, and the effect of cip could be smaller despite being long lasting, especially if added at a low dose.

e. coli may repair dsbs by reca-dependent homologous recombination   <cit> . cip-induced dsbs could be processed to single-stranded dna, a target for reca, which promotes recombinatorial repair and induction of the sos response through activation of the autocleavage of the lexa repressor  <cit> . rapid lethality is increased by the lexa ind-allele, and recombination-deficient e. coli strains are hypersensitive to quinolones  <cit> . the recbcd nuclease/helicase also seems to be required for sos induction by quinolones, as demonstrated with nalidixic acid  <cit> . interestingly, dsbs may also be repaired by a non-homologous end joining  mechanism that comprises break recognition, end processing, and ligation activities. although e. coli lacks a nhej pathway, its presence has been demonstrated in mycobacteria and bacillus  <cit> . nevertheless, nhej deficiency caused by the loss of ku and ligd has no effect on the sensitivity to quinolones of mycobacterium smegmatis  <cit> .

repair of quinolone-induced dsbs probably needs more complex processing because both 5' ends of cleaved dna are linked covalently via phosphotyrosine bonds to a topoisomerase subunit. these dna-protein crosslinks  could be eliminated in coordination with the nucleotide excision repair  mechanism. the urvabc nuclease, which initiates the ner pathway in e. coli, may incise dpcs with or without previous proteolytic degradation of the crosslinked protein  <cit> . accordingly, ner seems to be involved in cip-induced dna damage, as demonstrated in deficient e. coli strains  <cit> . although both ner and hr may commit to the repair of dpcs, it has been proposed recently that dpcs with crosslinked proteins of sizes < 12– <dig> kda are repaired by ner, whereas oversized dpcs are processed exclusively by recbcd-dependent hr  <cit> . if confirmed, the later mechanism should be preferred in the repair of dpcs involving topoisomerase subunits.

the repair activity was not strictly related to viability. although the nucleoid may appear normal after repair, particularly at the low dose , the bacteria may not be fully viable, possibly because of the lack of total fidelity in restitution and the sos response, resulting in an error-prone repair  <cit> . some misrepaired lesions could lead to a non-viable cell. the dna repair experiments emphasize the importance of achieving the necessary concentrations over a prolonged time for the successful clinical effect of quinolones.

dna repair is not cited as a mechanism of decreased sensitivity to quinolones. nevertheless, e. coli mutants with constitutive reca expression or defective sos induction may survive longer  <cit> . it is possible that dysfunction of certain dna repair processes may lead to a low sensitivity to cip, and this could increase the effect of other coexisting mechanisms of resistance. this possibility needs to be explored.

it is expected that resistance to fluoroquinolones would hinder the production of dsbs, which are slowly or rarely produced. because dsbs appear to correlate strongly with the mic and viability, the dna fragmentation assay should detect resistance accurately. the preliminary study of the dna fragmentation analysis in the four e. coli strains with low sensitivity to cip suggests that this is the case. the  <dig> strain did not show a clear effect at the mic dose and had a lower dna fragmentation level than that observed in other strains at the same multiple of mic dose. this phenomenon could be related to the accumulation of multiple resistance mechanisms, such as multiple mutations in different topoisomerase subunits and in conjunction with altered outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide, and increased activity of efflux systems  <cit> . since only j- <dig> and j-53qnra <dig> strains are isogenic, the other strains could have other differences that could influence the results. moreover, the growth inhibition may not be dependent on inhibition of the topoisomerases leading to dna fragmentation and the possibility exists of unknown mechanisms of action.

CONCLUSIONS
the dna fragmentation assay may be a simple and rapid test to evaluate the sensitivity and resistance to quinolones. we are currently performing more comprehensive assessment of different characterized cip-resistant and cip-sensitive e. coli strains and in clinical samples.
