BACKGROUND
the male-abnormal  <dig>  gene was first characterized in caenorhabditis elegans as part of the combinatorial genetic code affecting morphogenesis of the sensory rays, a male-specific sense organ located in the tail and involved in copulation. in that context, early studies  <cit>  identified a hypomorphic mab- <dig> allele as a dominant enhancer of egl- <dig>  a loss-of-function mutation affecting the nematode homolog of the drosophila homeotic gene abdominalb. subsequent studies  <cit>  demonstrated that mab- <dig> plays a key role in the formation of the nematode male tail. homozygous mab- <dig> mutations act cell-autonomously on the identity of a sensory ray, leading to alterations in anteroposterior identities akin to a homeotic transformation. furthermore, they act non-cell-autonomously on the binary switch between hypodermal and neuroblast specification. finally, hypomorphic mab- <dig> mutants exhibit pleiotropic changes affecting movement, body shape and fecundity, suggesting that mab- <dig> also plays key developmental roles outside the male tail region.

the mab- <dig> gene encodes a  <dig> kd basic protein with no significant homologies to any other published proteins. homologs of the mab- <dig> gene have been identified in many other species, from drosophila to humans. the first vertebrate counterparts of mab- <dig> were isolated in amniote genomes: a human homolog, mab21l <dig>  was cloned during a systematic search for transcripts carrying trinucleotide repeats  <cit>  and potentially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. interestingly, recent physical mapping data have located mab21l <dig> within a chromosomal deletion discovered in a patient with autism and language deficit secondary to an auditory processing abnormality  <cit> .

our group, in parallel with others, identified two murine mab- <dig> genes   <cit>  and the human mab21l <dig> gene, and showed that they encode nuclear proteins  <cit>  that are 94% identical, 98% homologous to each other. in the mouse, mab21l <dig> and mab21l <dig> are expressed in largely overlapping territories  <cit> , suggesting the possibility of a high degree of functional redundancy. more recently, only one vertebrate member of the mab- <dig> family was isolated in xenopus laevis   <cit> ,  and danio rerio  <cit>  . mab21l <dig> is an early marker of the tectum as well as primitive eye field, optic cup and retina in anamniotes, in agreement with observations previously made in mouse embryos.

to address the in vivo roles of mab- <dig> genes in vertebrates, loss-of-function studies have been carried out by different groups in xenopus and mouse embryos. lau et al.  <cit>  interfered with the functions of xmab21l <dig> in embryogenesis by applying antisense dna and double-stranded rnai techniques. as a result, they reported a high frequency of embryos arrested at late gastrula/early neurula, as well as a significant incidence of neural tube closure defects in tadpoles. likewise, wong and chow  <cit>  cultured mouse embryos in the presence of antisense oligos specific for mab21l <dig> and mab21l <dig>  and reported that both treatments caused a sharp increase in the incidence of defective axial turning, incomplete notochord formation, and neural tube closure defects. however, mab21l2-specific antisense oligos were more potent and more effective than mab21l1-specific ones, suggesting that mab21l <dig> may play a more irreplaceable role in early development than mab21l <dig> 

as said, mab- <dig> genes mark early stages of eye development in various species. likely due to redundancy in the vertebrate mab- <dig> gene family a knock-out mouse carrying a null mutation of mab21l <dig> featured an isolated, cell-autonomous defect in lens placode development, providing a novel and valuable model for the study of various eye defects in humans  <cit> , but no overt retinal abnormalities. conversely, mab21l <dig> has been found to participate crucially in zebrafish retina formation acting as a downstream effector of rx <dig>  <cit> .

some of these important advances point to a critical role for the mab- <dig> gene family as a whole in early embryogenesis on one hand, and in various aspects of neural development on the other. however, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which mab- <dig> genes operate remains inadequate at best. interestingly, by genetic analysis of loss-of-function mutations in c. elegans, morita et al. have proposed mab- <dig> as a downstream target of a tgf-beta superfamily signaling pathway involved in sensory ray identity, the small/male-tail-abnormal pathway. this pathway is initiated by the secreted ligand cet- <dig>  <cit> , also known as dbl- <dig>  <cit> , and regulates body growth and male tail development. the cet-1/dbl- <dig> ligand transmits its signal through two receptor serine threonine kinases, daf- <dig> and sma- <dig>  which in turn regulate the activity of the nuclear transducers sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  and sma- <dig>  hypomorphic mutations of mab- <dig> are epistatic to cet- <dig> pathway mutations affecting ray pattern formation , while they do not affect body size in double mutants  <cit> . reportedly, this interaction did not reflect regulation of mab- <dig> gene transcription by the sma signaling pathway.

the above genetic studies prove the biological relevance of the mab- <dig> â€“ tgf-beta interaction, but stop short of addressing several key questions. what is the molecular counterpart of the genetic interaction described in c. elegans between mab- <dig> and the sma pathway? is this interaction conserved in vertebrate development, and what tgf-beta superfamily molecules does it involve? does it play a relevant role in the establishment of vertebrate dorsoventral  polarity? if so, at what level do mab- <dig> and tgf-beta pathways converge into a single regulatory cascade? in the present study, through a gain-of-function strategy, we analyze the molecular interplay between mab21l <dig>  a vertebrate homolog of c. elegans mab- <dig>  and tgf-beta superfamily signaling molecules. in particular, we focus on the signaling pathway initiated by bmp <dig>  a ligand structurally related to cet-1/dbl- <dig>  that regulates dv axis formation and numerous key aspects of neural development in chordata.

RESULTS
xmab21l <dig> expression in development
it is well established that the bmp <dig> pathway is essential for proper formation of the dorsoventral axis; overexpression of bmp <dig> in xenopus embryos can lead to the formation ventralized embryos, i.e. embryos devoid of axial structures, whereas bmp <dig> depletion can lead to dorsalized embryos, i.e. embryos exhibiting an expansion of dorsal mesoderm  <cit> . at tailbud stages, the expression of xmab21l <dig> is restricted to the primitive eye field, optic recess, optic cup and retina , to the tectum and dorsal neural tube, and to branchial arches . the early-onset and sustained expression of the mab21l <dig> protein in oocyte-, blastula, gastrula, tailbud and tadpole lysates suggests that mab21l <dig> is expressed both maternally and zygotically, during and after gastrulation .

mab21l <dig> coexpression rescues the dorsal axis in bmp4-injected xenopus embryos
to determine whether xmab21l <dig> and bmp <dig> have a synergistic or antagonistic interaction in vivo, we took a gain of function approach utilizing xenopus laevis embryos. preliminary rt-pcr experiments conducted on gastrula lysates injected at the one-cell stage with bmp <dig> mrna had shown that, as previously reported by others in studies conducted in the nematode, xenopus mab21l <dig> expression is not controlled by bmp <dig> signaling .

prior to addressing the nature of the interaction between xmab21l <dig> and bmp signaling molecules, we analyzed the effects of isolated xmab21l <dig> overexpression. embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with  <dig> pg in vitro-transcribed xmab21l <dig> alone. we analyzed the phenotype of injected tailbud embryos as well as the expression of dorsal markers at gastrulation. a significant percentage of injected embryos  featured various degrees of dorsalization/anteriorization , with a well formed, sometimes enlarged head, a broad cement gland, a short and/or bent axis . we prepared embryos for histological examination by sectioning them along the longitudinal plane, both sagittally and horizontally. histological analysis of horizontal sections revealed many tadpoles featuring an enlarged notochord , suggestive of a possible defect in convergent extension. finally, wholemount in situ hybridization experiments conducted on gastrulae with markers of dv polarity revealed an increased percentage of embryos  with expanded and/or enhanced chordin gene expression . perturbation of xvent <dig> gene expression was sporadic, with  <dig> out of  <dig> xmab21l2-injected embryos featuring a reduced xvent <dig> expression domain . our results are in sufficient agreement with those previously obtained by others  <cit> , confirming that xmab21l <dig> overexpression produces neither signs of complete dorsalization, such as janus twins or radial eyes  <cit> , nor axis duplication.

to determine whether xmab21l <dig> can compensate the effects of bmp <dig> overexpression, xenopus embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with in vitro-transcribed bmp <dig> mrna alone , or coinjected with xmab21l <dig> mrna . we scored the formation of dorsal structures in tadpole stage embryos by using the dorsoanterior index  <cit> . a complete loss of dorsal structures   was observed in  <dig> % of the embryos after bmp <dig> overexpression  . coinjection with  <dig>  or  <dig>  ng xmab21l <dig> drastically reduced this class . likewise, whilst complete dorsal structures   were observed in only  <dig> % of bmp4-injected embryos, coinjection with  <dig>  or  <dig>  ng xmab21l <dig> increased this class significantly , suggesting that xmab21l <dig> antagonizes bmp <dig> in its ability to ventralize embryonic mesoderm in vivo .

next, by wholemount in situ hybridization, we analyzed the expression of molecular markers of dorsal  and ventral  mesoderm in wildtype embryos, as well as embryos injected with bmp <dig> alone or coinjected with xmab21l <dig>  whilst the expression domain of chd was sharply reduced in 88% of bmp4-injected embryos, 47% of the embryos co-injected with xmab21l <dig> showed wild type chd expression . likewise, 64% of the bmp4-injected embryos showed a dorsal expansion of xvent <dig> expression, that was rescued in 83% of the embryos co-injected with xmab21l <dig> .

mab21l <dig> interacts with smad <dig> in vitro and in vivo
the antagonistic interaction between mab21l <dig> and bmp <dig> may be either interpreted as evidence of a molecular interaction between mab21l <dig> and some bmp signaling transducer, or alternatively suggest that mab21l <dig> and some component of the bmp signaling pathway compete for a common cofactor. it is well established that the dna-binding protein smad <dig>  once phosphorylated at the plasma membrane by the bmp receptor heterotetramer, assembles with the receptor-independent protein smad <dig>  enters the nucleus, establishes interactions with various cofactors, and acts by regulating the transcription of a host of target genes . because vertebrate mab- <dig> proteins are mainly or exclusively distributed in the nucleus  <cit> , we investigated the possibility of a molecular interaction between mab21l <dig> and smad proteins. in order to obtain in vitro evidence of this interaction, p <dig> cells were either treated with bmp <dig> or left untreated, and subsequently lysed. p <dig> cell extracts were then incubated with a resin-bound his-zz-tagged form of mab21l <dig>  or with a control his-zz-coupled resin. eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-smad <dig> antibody. the experiment revealed a clear interaction between synthetic his-zz-mab21l <dig> and endogenous smad <dig> that was absent when p <dig> lysates were incubated with the control resin . although bmp <dig> treatment seemed to enhance it considerably, the interaction was not entirely bmp4-dependent, suggesting that conformational changes secondary to receptor-mediated phosphorylation may not be strictly required for smad <dig> to interact with mab21l <dig> 

these results prompted more questions, such as whether the interaction between mab21l <dig> and smad <dig> is direct and whether it is dependent on prior formation of a smad1-smad <dig> complex. once again, we resorted to affinity chromatography, incubating in vitro-translated, 35s-met-labeled smad <dig> and smad <dig> with a resin containing his-zz-mab21l <dig>  this experiment suggested that the interaction with smad <dig> is direct, and that mab21l <dig> does not assemble with smad <dig> directly but only through smad <dig>  indicating that the formation of a smad4-mab21l <dig> complex is mediated by smad <dig> . indirectly, this experiment also showed that mab21l <dig> does not obviously compete with smad <dig> to assemble with smad <dig> 

finally, we investigated whether the in vitro interaction observed between mab21l <dig> and smad <dig> could be replicated in vivo. p <dig> cells co-transfected with myc-mab21l <dig> and flag-smad <dig> were either treated with bmp <dig> or left untreated. in parallel, xenopus laevis embryos were injected at the four-cell stage into the animal pole of each blastomere with myc-mab21l <dig> and flag-smad <dig> mrnas, and coinjected with either bmp <dig> mrna or h2o. the embryos were grown until mid-gastrula stage . both cell- and embryo lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation, using an anti flag monoclonal antibody, whereas an anti-myc antibody was utilized for immunodetection in western blotting. experiments conducted in transfected p <dig> cells showed that smad <dig> coprecipitates with mab21l <dig>  and that the interaction is enhanced by activation of bmp signaling, which is required for nuclear localization of receptor-dependent smads . likewise, mab21l2-smad <dig> co-precipitation took place especially, albeit not exclusively, in bmp4-coinjected embryos . interaction of the two proteins in the absence of exogenous bmp <dig> can likely be explained by the abundance of endogenous bmp2/ <dig> ligands in stage  <dig> gastrulae.

when targeted to an heterologous promoter, mab21l <dig> acts as a strong transcriptional repressor
because in vivo mab21l <dig> acts as a bmp <dig> antagonist, and because bmp <dig> signaling is transduced in the nucleus by smad transactivators, we asked whether mab21l <dig> has any intrinsic repressor functions. to address this point, we generated fusion transcripts adding the gal <dig> dna binding domain   <cit> , either to the n- or c-terminus of mab21l <dig>  for as yet unexplained reasons, the latter fusion protein proved extremely unstable and was discarded. conversely, the n-terminal fusion protein is stable and was shown to bind dna by gel-retardation assay . thus, we were able to assess its activity in cotransfection assays, using as a reporter system the gal <dig> target promoter  fused to luciferase. luciferase activity in mab21l2-cotransfected cos <dig> cells was compared to the baseline reporter activity scored in cells transfected with the gal <dig> dbd alone  or with a transcriptionally inactive gal <dig> dbd fusion protein,   <cit> . reporter activity was clearly downregulated in gal4-mab21l2-transfected cells only, suggesting that mab21l <dig> may function as a transcriptional repressor or co-repressor . the same luciferase assay was performed in p <dig> cells, co-transfected with plasmid dna, g-d, and g-m, revealing a 12-fold downregulation of 5xuas-luc in g-m-transfected cells . this confirmed the evidence of a strong repressor activity of mab21l <dig> when targeted to dna.

discussion
mab- <dig> genes have been isolated in several species and have been shown, through genetic and epigenetic loss-of-function experiments, to play key roles in various developmental processes, ranging from gastrulation and neural tube closure to eye and lens formation  <cit> . however, no biochemical data have been available to identify the regulatory cascade in which these elusive factors are involved. while epistatic analysis has proposed that c. elegans mab- <dig> undergoes inhibitory regulation by tgf-beta superfamily signals  <cit> , the molecular nature of this regulation remained obscure. likewise, no information has been published as to the conservation and relevance of the sma/mab- <dig> interaction in vertebrate development.

our results, obtained in an anamniotic model system, the xenopus embryo, and in murine embryonic carcinoma cells, indicate that mab21l <dig> interacts functionally with smad <dig>  a nuclear transducer of bmp2/4/ <dig> signaling. overexpression of mab21l <dig> complements the effects of bmp <dig> overexpression, in keeping with the epistatic interactions observed in nematodes  <cit> . thus, genetic interactions first described in pseudocoelomates appear to be strongly conserved in evolution.

as the nuclear localization of mab21l <dig> suggested, our pull-down and immunoprecipitation results indicate that mab21l <dig> is a new interactor of the receptor-activated transducer smad <dig>  whilst the interaction between mab21l <dig> and smad <dig> appears to be direct, our results do not seem to favor a direct contact between mab21l <dig> and smad <dig> 

the interaction of mab21l <dig>  a transcriptional repressor, with nuclear transducers of bmp signaling offers a possible explanation for the results of loss-of-function experiments conducted by other investigators in xenopus laevis and mouse embryos. the increasing levels of mab21l <dig> protein observed starting at midblastula transition may be required to compensate mesoderm-ventralizing signals triggered by bmp2/ <dig>  in the absence of mab21l <dig> genes, completion of gastrulation may be hampered, resulting in various abnormalities of dorsoventral polarity  <cit> . results obtained by others have demonstrated that smad complexes can be turned into negative regulators of transcription through a physical interaction with transcriptional repressors  <cit> . our results indicate that mab21l <dig> possesses a considerable transcriptional repressor activity. however, the antagonistic interactions between mab21l <dig> and bmp signaling may not necessarily depend on the formation of transcriptional regulation complexes. further experiments will be required to characterize the mechanism of transcriptional regulation mediated by mab21l <dig>  importantly, the identification of mab21l <dig> downstream genes will make it possible to investigate mab- <dig> â€“ bmp <dig> interactions from the opposite standpoint, i.e. by looking at the modulatory effect of bmp signaling on the expression of mab21l <dig> targets.

although our results are more directly relevant to understanding the functions of mab21l <dig> in early embryogenesis, the gene is clearly expressed at high levels and in a tightly localized fashion in neurulation and morphogenesis as well, likely contributing to neural tube and eye formation. indeed, because of redundancy in the mab- <dig> gene family, many of the early effects of mab- <dig> gene mutation may be masked, uncovering these genes' roles in later stages of development and postnatal life.

in late developmental processes, well beyond the end of gastrulation, mab- <dig> proteins may prolong their dynamic interaction with bmp signaling transducers. as mentioned, a cell-autonomous requirement for mab21l <dig> in lens formation has been recently documented in knock-out mice  <cit>  that develop otherwise normally in the nervous system. in the same mice, genetic redundancy has hampered the analysis of mab- <dig> gene function in retinal development. however, antisense studies have shown that inhibition of mab- <dig> leads to disruption of the retinal anlage, where the gene is strongly expressed in a territory overlapping with the bmp <dig> and xvent <dig> expression domain. recent studies have shown that bmp signaling plays a relevant role in guiding morphogenesis along the dorsoventral axis of the chick  <cit>  and xenopus  <cit>  retina. in this context, it would be interesting to determine if mab- <dig> genes act by balancing bmp signals in the establishment of retinal polarity.

mab21l <dig> and mab21l <dig> are prominently expressed in the embryonic midbrain, both dorsally and ventrally, and in prosomere  <dig>  <cit> . roles exerted by bmp signaling molecules in these territories are starting to emerge, and appear relevant to the induction and patterning of dorsal mesencephalic structures   <cit> , and, more ventrally, to the differentiation of dopaminergic precursors  <cit> .

throughout the hindbrain and spinal cord, mab21l <dig> is expressed mostly in dorsal territories. in cerebellar development, it is expressed in the cerebellar plate and, later on, in granule cell neurons  <cit> . bmp signaling molecules are coexpressed with mab21l <dig> at several of those sites, and their developmental roles have been at least partially addressed: as an example, granule cell specification can be induced by bmp <dig> overexpression in the dorsal and ventral rhombencephalon  <cit> . bmp <dig> is homologous to bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  and its signal can be transduced by smad <dig>  <cit> . likewise, in the spinal cord mab21l <dig> is expressed in a dorsal territory, where bmp2/ <dig> signaling plays a key role in the specification of neuronal identities alongside the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube  <cit> .

finally, in postmigratory neural crest, the interplay between bmp2/ <dig> and mash <dig> maintains competence for neuronal differentiation  <cit> . in neural crest derivatives, including the branchial arches, mab21l <dig> may thus participate in specifying neuronal and non-neuronal cell fates by interacting with bmp signals.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a biochemical and molecular foundation for future studies of mab- <dig> gene function in vertebrate systems, demonstrating that mab21l <dig> interacts functionally with the bmp <dig> signalling pathway and physically with its best characterized nuclear transducer, smad <dig>  furthermore, we show that mab21l <dig> can act as a powerful transcriptional repressor when targeted to an heterologous promoter. further work is clearly required to determine if mab21l <dig> binds dna, what its binding specificity is, or if it only exerts its effect in a dna-binding-independent fashion. more broadly, additional studies are required to clarify the role of mab- <dig> genes in the context of bmp signaling, and their likely function as a molecular switch linking different regulatory pathways in development and disease.
