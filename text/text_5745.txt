BACKGROUND
elastin-like proteins  are recombinant biopolymers consisting of vpgxg pentapeptides  derived from the vpgvg sequence found in the natural matrix protein tropoelastin  <cit> . they are compatible with living cells  <cit>  and also respond to changes in temperature, pressure, salt concentration, and ph through sol-gel phase transition  <cit> . both biological and mechanical properties of elps can be readily tailored at the gene level to satisfy end-user applications, thus offering numerous choices for the development of cell culture matrices for tissue engineering  <cit> . however, elps containing a neutral or hydrophobic amino acid residue in the guest position x are limited in their usage for cell growth or tissue regeneration due to their low binding affinity to mammalian cells  <cit> . therefore, modification of the vpgxg backbone with cell-adhesive sequences has been a major issue in developing elp-based ecm analogues.

neuronal cells require contact sites within their surrounding matrix, not only for initial cell attachment but also for long-term differentiation  <cit> . in the natural ecm environment, the cell-adhesion sequences or domains found in various types of ecm proteins provide contact sites and modulate neuronal cell behaviors through interaction with cell-surface receptors  <cit> . among them, an rgd tripeptide derived from fibronectin, vitronectin, or laminin, is a potent integrin-binding ligand associated with adhesion-mediated cell migration and is involved in neurite elongation during neuronal cell differentiation  <cit> . an rgd ligand has been utilized to increase the cell adhesion affinity of the elps. for example, an apgvgv-based elp did not attach to 3 t3-l <dig> fibroblasts, however, when it was fused with the rgd peptide, the resulting polypeptide was able to bind fibroblasts  <cit> . similarly, the rgd-vpgig polypeptide supports stronger spreading of huvecs than its negative control containing a scrambled rdg sequence  <cit> . these rgd-functionalized elps have been explored in non-neural and neural cell growth, especially in a recent study on pc- <dig> neuronal cells that highlights the potential of rgd-incorporated eltcps as part of a biocompatible coating in neuronal tissue engineering  <cit> .

an rgd-containing elp, [rgd-v <dig>  has previously been produced through genetic recombination of rgd ligand with vgvpg pentapeptide  <cit> . preliminary biological assays showed that [rgd-v <dig> was not toxic with respect to the viability of fibroblasts or neuroblasts and was more effective in promoting the proliferation of neuroblasts than its counterpart that contained no rgd motifs. by using a neuroblastoma cell line, n2a, as a test model for in vitro assays, this study therefore aimed to further investigate the potential feasibility of this fusion protein as an ecm analogue with the ability to modulate neuronal cell behaviors and differentiation. for this purpose, biomimetic surfaces were prepared through the isothermal adsorption of [rgd-v <dig> on tcps, and the effects of protein-coated surfaces on n2a cell adhesion and migration as well as on the expression of neuronal biomarkers were quantitatively measured by quantitative rt-pcr  and immunofluorescence staining.

RESULTS
purification and characterization of 20
the primary structures of  <dig> and are shown in figure 1a. in  <dig>   <dig> rgd motifs were evenly distributed throughout the whole molecular structure. typically, from a 40 l fermentation batch of e. coli, approximately 600 g of wet cell cake was obtained. after  <dig> rounds of inverse transition cycling,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were recovered from a  <dig> liter batch with a purity greater than 95%, as judged by densitometry on an sds-page gel . when a uv-visible spectrum of  <dig> in phosphate-buffered saline  was scanned from  <dig> to 200 nm , its maximum absorbance occurred at 280 nm, and  <dig> shoulders were detected at  <dig>  and 288 nm . no absorbance was detected in the visible region.

measurement of cell adhesion affinity
to investigate the effect of rgd modification on cell adhesion, a series of comparative assays was performed on the surfaces of tcps,  <dig>   <dig>  and fibronectin. as an initial test, protein-coated surfaces were prepared by isothermal adsorption of 5 μm protein solutions at 4°c.

the relative percentages of cell attachment on tcps,  <dig>  and  <dig> were 12% ±  <dig> %, 43% ±  <dig> % and 88% ±  <dig> % of fibronectin, respectively, suggesting efficient cell adhesion to the  <dig> coated surface. to determine the cell-binding constants, the plots of cell adhesion versus protein-coating concentration were calculated and are displayed in figure  <dig>  as the coating concentration increased from  <dig>  to 10 μm, no noticeable cell-binding pattern was observed on the plot for 20; the data did not fit to either a linear first order  or hyperbolic  regression. in contrast, n2a adhesion to either  <dig>  or fibronectin  resulted in a hyperbolic graph with a saturation around 2 μm protein concentration. the apparent maximum cell binding to  <dig> was approximately 96% of fibronectin, with half-maximal adhesion on  <dig> and fibronectin occurring at a coating concentration of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10-7 m, respectively.

the saturated adsorption density of the rgd-vpgig polypeptide  and fibronectin  were adopted from the published literature as being 30 ng/mm <dig>   <cit>  and 8 ng/mm <dig>   <cit> , respectively. based on the report that elps with different amino acid content showed a similar levels of adsorption  <cit> , we numerically estimated the saturated surface density of [rgd-v <dig> as  <dig> fmol/mm <dig>  which in turn led us to interpret that both the bmax and kd values of [rgd-v <dig> for n2a cell binding would be 14-fold lower than those respective values for fibronectin.

stimulation of cell spreading
the effect of protein-coated surfaces on cell spreading morphology was inspected by phase contrast microscopy. morphological characteristics of n2a cells were divided into two shapes: round shape and extended shape. round cells were dominant on both tcps and , whereas almost equal populations of two classes of cell shapes were observed on the microscopic images of the cells adhered on 20-adsorbed substrates . for fibronectin-coated substrate, extended cells were dominant and relatively small population of less spread cells was observed . consequently, the percentage of cell spreading increased in the following order of proteins: tcps  <  <dig>  < fibronectin .

acceleration of cell migration speed
an n2a migration assay was performed on tcps- and protein-coated surfaces prepared at 20 μg/ml coating concentration. the typical images of cell migration across the scratched zone are shown in figure 4a, and the number of cells that migrated during the 30 h culture period has been compared in figure 4b. when cells were grown on tcps and  <dig>  the number of cells in the scratched area steadily increased over the 30-h period, giving cmi values of /h and /h, respectively. when cell motility on  <dig> and fibronectin was measured after 24 h of culture, the n2a cells migrated with the same speed of /h, which was  <dig> -fold faster than the mobility of the cells on tcps. however, when the number of migrated cells were counted at 30 h of culture, the cmi was significantly  enhanced to /h. interestingly, during the 24–30 h culture period, the cmi values measured for  <dig> and fibronectin were /h and /h, respectively, which were approximately 8-fold faster than the migration speed of the cells on the 20-coated surface during the same period.

up-regulation of neuronal biomarker expression
we evaluated whether [rgd-v <dig> could affect n2a differentiation by measuring the expression levels of several neuronal proteins such as nse and tuj <dig>  nf <dig>  map <dig>  and gfap, which have been widely used as biomarkers for neuronal cells, axonal development, dendritic cells, and astrocytes, respectively  <cit> . figure  <dig> compares the mrna levels of these markers in n2a cells grown on tcps or [rgd-v <dig> in the presence and absence of retinoic acid . the expression of tuj <dig> , map <dig> , and gfap  was enhanced significantly  in the cells cultured on [rgd-v <dig>  whereas the expression of nse and nf on [rgd-v <dig> did not differ from that of the cells grown on tcps. the mrna levels of marker proteins were further elevated following ra treatment, the highest expression being observed in the cells cultured on [rgd-v <dig> treated with ra.

promotion of neuronal differentiation along with neurite outgrowth
immunofluorescence staining of tuj <dig> expression was performed to further validate the stimulatory effect of  <dig> on neuronal differentiation. figure  <dig> shows the immunofluorescence images of n2a cells on tcps,  <dig>   <dig>  and fibronectin after 5 days of culture. initially, culture surfaces were prepared using  <dig>  μm of protein solutions. in response to 20 μm ra treatment, most n2a cells extended neurites on the tcps,  <dig>  and  <dig> surfaces . in the absence of ra, less than 4% of cells showed neurite formation on tcps and  <dig> , whereas on  <dig>   <dig> % ±  <dig> %  of cells exhibited tadpole-like morphological features with sprouting neurites . we subsequently analyzed the neuritogenesis at 5 μm coating concentration, and the percentage of neuritogenesis was found to be  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, which was significantly different from the values obtained for tcps and  <dig>  but was not statistically significant  from the value obtained at the  <dig>  μm  <dig> coating concentration. interestingly, n2a cells bearing 2– <dig> nuclei within a single cytosol body with multiple neurites were seen . in parallel experiments, the effect of fibronectin on n2a differentiation was analyzed at the 5 μm coating concentration, and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of neurite formation was noted . figure 6i compares the neuritogenesis of n2a cells on tcps and protein-coated surfaces and clearly shows that  <dig> promotes neuronal differentiation.

discussion
an elp-based recombinant protein has been produced to develop a bioactive matrix that can stimulate the neuronal cell behaviors and differentiation. to evaluate biological effects of rgd-modified elp on neural cell behaviors and particularly on neural differentiation in vitro, bioactive substrates were prepared by physically adsorption of the rgd-modified recombinant elps onto the conventional tcps. isothermal adsorption process has been known as a robust method to generate biomimetic surfaces suitable for displaying and investigating the effects of ecm functional domains on neural differentiation  <cit> .

cell adhesion affinity of [rgd-v <dig> was approximately 2-fold higher than that of [v <dig>  the mode of n2a binding to [rgd-v <dig> followed hyperbolic saturation and was similar to the adhesion of the cells on fibronectin-coated surface, where cell attachment reached a plateau at the high surface density of the rgd peptide. both the enhanced attachment of the cells onto [rgd-v <dig> in comparison with that on [v <dig> and saturable binding mode are indicatives of rgd-mediated cell binding through cell-surface receptors. based on the numerically estimated saturation values, the difference in maximum cell adhesion capacity between [rgd-v <dig> and fibronectin would fall within  <dig> orders of magnitude. n2a cells were found to have a higher affinity for [v <dig> than for tcps control surfaces. this is similar to the enhanced interaction observed between fibroblasts and x20-poly, but only if fbs was added to the assay media  <cit> . however, throughout this study, [v <dig> was inefficient in stimulating n2a cell migration and differentiation, indicating that the interaction of n2a cells with [v <dig> is physiologically irrelevant. therefore, attachment of n2a cells to the [v720-coated surfaces would possibly be mediated by cell-adhesion molecules originated from the fbs, as shown by the fibroblast adhesion to the poor-cell-binding x20-poly  <cit> .

the effect of [rgd-v <dig> coatings in n2a cells spreading experiments showed a similar cellular morphology to that seen on fibronectin-coated surfaces, which seems to correlate with enhanced cell spreading. the result presented in this study is in good agreement with previous report whereby fibroblasts formed spreading structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia at the edges of the cells grown on the [rgd-v <dig> matrix  <cit> .

on the cell-adhesive surfaces, cell locomotion is governed by the interactions between the integrin receptors and their ligands displayed on the cell surfaces  <cit> . in comparison with the motility on [v <dig>  which lacks integrin-adhesion ligands, n2a cells migrated much faster on [rgd-v <dig>  and therefore, this was attributed to the rgd-mediated cell adhesion. until 24 h of culture, the number of cells that migrated across the scratched edges was not statistically different among all  <dig> substrates. however, during the 24–30 h culture period, a significant increase in the population of migrating cells was measured on both [rgd-v <dig> and fibronectin but not on tcps and [v <dig>  the result suggests a 2-phase migration mode, that is, initially slow movement followed by a fast migration stage, and also implies that [rgd-v <dig> activate signaling events within the cells to express a motile phenotype during the slow migration period.

the incorporation of rgd motifs into the relatively inert elastic vgvpg backbone has yielded an ecm analogue with fibronectin-like function in directing neural differentiation. for instance, immunofluorescence analysis of tuj <dig> expression showed that [rgd-v <dig> promote neuronal differentiation along with neurite extension even without ra treatment. unlike [rgd-v <dig>  the [v <dig> was not able to promote neurite elongation, and the lack of neurite outgrowth on the matrix is possibly due to the absence of the rgd motifs that are necessary for proper neurite elongation  <cit> . thus, enhanced neurite elongation from n2a cells reflects the activation of signal transduction at the n2a cell-[rgd-v <dig> interfaces. the rgd motif of fibronectin binds αvβ3and α5β <dig> integrins to promote neuritogenesis by pc <dig> cells  <cit> . whereas, interaction of integrin α8β <dig> with rgd sequence in cell adhesion molecule stimulates neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion  <cit> . in pc <dig> cells, rgd-mediated adhesion triggers many signaling events including focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization  <cit> . whether these signaling cascades occur in response to [rgd-v <dig> remains to be studied.

the spontaneous increase in tuj <dig> expression under non-differentiating conditions was in contrast to the effect of the poly peptide, which supports neurite extension from pc- <dig> cells when nerve growth factor is present in the growth media  <cit> . however, up-regulation of the neuronal markers tuj <dig>  map <dig>  and gfap in the cells grown on [rgd-v <dig> confirmed that [rgd-v <dig> is effective in stimulating neuronal cell differentiation. moreover, the expression levels of nse, tuj <dig>  nf <dig>  map <dig>  and gfap were significantly elevated in the presence of both [rgd-v <dig> and ra. this additive effect indicates that [rgd-v <dig> enhances the differentiation response of neuronal cells to ra. this is important for eventual in vivo application of matrix protein in combination with differentiation-stimulating agents.

CONCLUSIONS
our results prove the feasibility of employing a genetically engineered biomimetic matrix protein for functional activation of neuronal cell behaviors. adhesion affinity, spreading morphology, and migration speed of n2a cells on the  <dig> protein were similar to those seen on fibronectin. moreover, neuritogenesis and up-regulation of neuronal mark proteins have been achieved by culturing n2a cells on 20-coated surfaces. adhesion-mediated neural differentiation is highly desirable property in neural development and nerve repair. therefore, this elp-based ecm analogue can be used as a bioactive matrix for neural tissue engineering.
