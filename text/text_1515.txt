BACKGROUND
a complete annotated genome sequence of arabidopsis thaliana was released by the arabidopsis genome initiative  in the year  <dig>  the first completed plant genome <cit> . since then, our understanding of the arabidopsis genome structure and transcriptome has been improved through the release of  <dig> sequential updates to the annotation, culminating in the institute for genomic research's release  <dig> , which forms the basis of the work presented here. following the tigr <dig> annotation release, responsibility for maintaining and updating the arabidopsis annotation was turned over to the arabidopsis information resource , which has since released version  <dig> of the arabidopsis annotation . over the course of the tigr annotation releases, the number of annotated protein-coding genes of arabidopsis has increased from  <dig>   to a final total of  <dig>  protein coding genes plus  <dig>  regions annotated as transposon-related or other pseudogenes in the final tigr release. at the same time, the size of the arabidopsis pseudomolecules has increased from  <dig> mb in the initial  <dig> release, to  <dig> mb in tigr <dig> due to the inclusion of additional finished and unfinished bacs.

while the sequential tigr re-annotations of the genome have been relatively stable in terms of overall gene density and gene structure statistics, the major benefits of the re-annotation efforts have come from the incorporation of expressed sequence tags  and full length complementary dna  clone sequences into the arabidopsis annotation, improving the accuracy of individual gene structures  <cit> . however, transcripts from the most lowly expressed genes, or genes specifically expressed in important but relatively minor cell types such as meristems or the arabidopsis gametophyte stage may very likely be under-represented in the over half million ests available through genbank. to provide experimental support for genes lacking est or other cdna evidence, we have previously carried out high-throughput rapid amplification of cdna ends  experiments and generated partial or complete sequence for over  <dig> genes, leading to the improvement of many gene structures  <cit> .

genome annotation is never complete or final. since its release in january of  <dig>  various lines of evidence have come to light which suggest that the tigr <dig> annotation still paints an incomplete picture of the arabidopsis gene space and transcriptome. continued submission of ests and other sequence information to genbank reveals the existence of transcripts that do not map to currently annotated genes  <cit> . these may represent novel protein coding genes, genes which code small unknown peptides, or may also represent non-coding rna. additionally, evidence of transcription in un-annotated intergenic regions of the genome has been seen through massively parallel signature sequencing  efforts which reported several thousand transcript signatures from un-annotated intergenic regions  <cit> . analysis of whole-genome tiling arrays to examine the arabidopsis transcriptome have also provided strong indications for the presence of over five thousand novel transcriptional units  <cit> . a survey of the arabidopsis genome for a family of divergent cysteine rich anti-microbial defensin-like peptides yielded over  <dig> genes, 80% of which were absent from tigr's arabidopsis annotation  <cit> .

the wealth of new sequence data for other plant species that has become available since the landmark release of the arabidopsis genome has now allowed for the refining and improvement of gene detection based upon comparative genomic analysis. comparative genomics techniques have been proven extremely valuable for identifying conserved genes and regulatory elements in a variety of closely related species and has been already been applied effectively to the human genome  <cit> , as well as the malaria parasite genome  <cit>  and the c. elegans genome  <cit> , among others. the arabidopsis genome annotation is also beginning to benefit from comparative genomic analysis. a comparative study of arabidopsis thaliana and brassica oleracea yielded a large number of conserved arabidopsis genome regions , 72% of which aligned with predicted genes  <cit> . the remaining intergenic cags suggest the existence of several thousand currently un-annotated genes. race experiments have demonstrated transcriptional activity at  <dig> of  <dig> targeted cags, demonstrating that the cags may correspond to conserved un-annotated genes. a separate, similar investigation comparing the same brassica olreacea sequence set with the arabidopsis genome resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes that were missed by the tigr annotation  <cit> .

two relatively new gene prediction tools that make use of comparative genomics have been deployed for analysis of the arabidopsis genome: twinscan  <cit>  and eugene  <cit> . twinscan is a gene-structure prediction program that extends the probabilistic models employed by the ab initio gene finding program genscan  <cit> . twinscan exploits cross-species homology between closely related genomes to produce improved gene models. eugene is another gene prediction program developed to make use of comparative genomics for improved gene models. eugene makes use of multiple homologous sequences  from closely related organisms, tblastx analysis, splice site analysis and probabilistic models to provide gene predictions. both the twinscan and eugene programs have been applied to the arabidopsis genome, resulting in predictions for  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein coding genes, respectively. both twinscan and eugene predict more genes than currently exist in the tigr <dig> annotation, and there is significant overlap between the predictions produced by each program and with the tigr <dig> annotation. it is only within the more challenging un-annotated regions of genome where less evidence exists to support gene predictions where the overlap between twinscan and eugene predictions begins to decrease significantly. in addition to this work, twinscan has been applied broadly and with success to refine the annotation of the c. elegans  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , and rat  <cit>  genomes. the target for eugene at present is plant genomes and in addition to arabidopsis, has been deployed for poplar  <cit>  and barrel medic  <cit> .

like the hypothetical genes of arabidopsis that we have studied previously  <cit> , most of the novel genes predicted by twinscan and eugene lack experimental support. to assess the validity of these twinscan and eugene predictions we have applied a high-throughput race pipeline and have verified the presence, structure, and expression of several hundred currently un-annotated genes, of both deducible and potentially novel function.

RESULTS
intergenic predictions
several lines of evidence indicated that many likely genes were not captured by the tigr <dig> annotation. however, generating experimental evidence for these genes and their structures by race requires a working model upon which to design primers. pilot experiments based on twinscan and eugene predictions, as well as other evidence  showed that primers designed upon either twinscan or eugene predictions had good success rates, whereas primers designed against cags performed relatively poorly. therefore, we focused our efforts on genes predicted by one or both of these programs. in tigr <dig> intergenic space, defined here as all regions of the genome which do not overlap on the same strand with any annotated genes, there were  <dig>  twinscan predicted genes and  <dig>  eugene predicted genes, with the intersection of these  <dig> sets being  <dig> loci. the gene sizes and exon statistics for these genes are summarized in table  <dig>  interestingly, eugene predicts a larger number of smaller "genes" including  <dig> spliced predictions with predicted cds lengths of less than  <dig> bp. surprisingly, the average size of an intergenic spliced eugene prediction is smaller than that of an intergenic single exon  prediction. a significantly higher percentage of intergenic twinscan predictions have cds sizes of over  <dig> bp than do the intergenic eugene predictions. we targeted  <dig>  intergenic regions with our race pipeline. four hundred and forty eight  primer pairs were designed that were expected to amplify a gene predicted only by twinscan. three hundred and forty five  primer pairs were designed that were expected to amplify a gene predicted only by eugene. an additional  <dig> primer pairs were designed which were compatible with overlapping predictions generated by both twinscan and eugene in the same genomic region.

race success rates
the success of the race pipeline, defined as the frequency of obtaining race product that mapped to an intergenic prediction , is summarized in table  <dig>  both twinscan and eugene predicted genes with good efficiency. we obtained full length experimental sequence support, either from race data or subsequent full length cloning attempts, for  <dig> genes out of  <dig>  targeted. two hundred and fifty seven  of the verified genes overlapped with at least one eugene prediction,  <dig> overlapped with at least one twinscan prediction, and  <dig> genes overlapped with at least one or more twinscan and one or more eugene predictions. in several instances, our experimentally verified transcript assemblies overlapped multiple twinscan or eugene predictions, such as neighboring genes at.chr <dig> . <dig> and at.chr <dig> . <dig>  we also observed instances where our experimental results merged the two neighboring gene predictions into a single orf, as was the case with eugene predictions at02eug <dig> and at02eug <dig> . interestingly, in the case of these  <dig> eugene predictions, while most of our experimental data suggests a longer orf that was better predicted by twinscan than eugene, we have also identified several clones which posses polya tails and support one of the shorter, unmerged orfs predicted by eugene. this suggests that twinscan and eugene may have independently predicted different isoforms of the same gene.

with our race pipeline, we observed full-length success rates of 42% for genes predicted by twinscan, 41% for genes predicted by eugene, and a much higher 58% for genes predicted by both programs. we also obtained partial length sequence from an additional  <dig> genes. these genes were determined to be partial length due to the absence of either a start codon, a stop codon, or an intact open reading frame relative to the underlying prediction.

structure of novel genes
the novel genes validated by our race pipeline vary widely coding length and exon count . although many of the novel genes were relatively short and contained a single exon and un-spliced transcript, there are some striking exceptions. figure  <dig> shows twinscan predicted at.chr <dig> . <dig>  a gene for which we recovered  <dig> splice isoforms, possessing between  <dig> and  <dig> coding exons. alternative splicing is observed with over 30%  of the un-annotated genes verified through these efforts. genes were detected having between  <dig>  and  <dig>  splicing isoforms .

accuracy of twinscan and eugene predictions
the gene level performance  and specificity ) of the twinscan and eugene predictions was determined using as a reference set the longest experimentally verified open reading frame from each of the  <dig> genes for which we recovered full length sequence, comparing these with only those intergenic predictions which overlapped this set. this analysis included 21% of the total intergenic twinscan predictions and 15% of the total intergenic eugene predictions. these data are summarized in figure  <dig>  sensitivity  and specificity  is shown at the gene level. on this level, both eugene and twinscan performed similarly, with sensitivities  of 49% and 54%, respectively. the specificities were also similar for both programs.

functional analysis of un-annotated genes
to investigate the possible functions of these un-annotated genes, we searched  <dig> intergenic full length orf sequences against tigr's in-house non-identical protein database using blastx. two hundred and seventy eight genes had significant protein matches. approximately 50%  of the genes having a significant database hit are most similar to hypothetical proteins, or other proteins of unknown function. many genes were also found to have significant matches with well characterized proteins. the top ten blast hits are shown in table  <dig>  several genes such as twinscan predicted at.chr <dig> . <dig> , which aligns with a sub-family of alpha  <dig> , mannosyltransferase enzymes, are not similar to any annotated arabidopsis genes. this gene is conserved across the eukarya with homologues from human, mouse, zebrafish, yeast, and rice. others, such as at.chr <dig> . <dig> are highly similar to hypothetical genes in arabidopsis. multiple sequence alignments with homologues of this gene show that it is a member of a sub-family of uncharacterized hairpin domain containing proteins that is specific to arabidopsis, suggesting more recent duplication events.

expression patterns of un-annotated genes
to determine the expression pattern of un-annotated genes, we examined reporter gene expression in gene and enhancer trap lines obtained from cold spring harbor laboratory's trapper collection  <cit> . after searching  <dig> intergenic orfs against the trapper database, we identified  <dig> lines potentially tagging unannotated loci. expression was reported for two of these lines on the cshl website. we obtained enhancer or gene trap lines that tagged  <dig> intergenic loci. with enhancer trap line et <dig>  gus expression was observed in the roots, anthers, pollen, stigma, style, and abscission zones . this enhancer trap insertion is situated proximal to at.chr <dig> . <dig>   <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. our experimental sequence corresponding with this locus shows similarity  to a desiccation associated protein from lilium longiflorum and multiple rop-interactive crib  motif-containing proteins from arabidopsis thaliana, a family of versatile molecular switches involved in many phases of plant development and environmental response  <cit> . members of this divergent family of genes have previously been shown to be involved in pollen tube elongation. for line et <dig>  which tags twinscan predicted at.chr <dig> . <dig>  we observed gus expression in developing floral organs . this enhancer trap is located approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the at.chr <dig> . <dig> start codon, in the putative promoter region. additionally, gus expression for this line has been reported on cshl's trapperdb website in trichomes, immature leaves and the epidermis, though we have not observed this pattern. our experimental sequence for this gene shows high similarity with a putative clavata3/esr-related  precursor protein. due possibly to their small size, genes in the cle family were overlooked by automated annotation programs  <cit>  but were subsequently annotated upon request. for a third gene, we obtained gene trap line gt <dig>  which is inserted into an exon of a gene predicted by twinscan as at.chr <dig> . <dig> . the cshl website reported low level gus expression from this line in root tips and root hairs. after examining whole plants ranging in developmental stage from seedling to mature flowering plant, we did not observe any gus expression with this line, even though our race experiments verified that this gene is expressed.

promoter-reporter analysis
we utilized the promoters from six intergenic genes to drive expression of gus and gfp reporter genes in transgenic arabidopsis plants. for at.chr <dig> . <dig>   both gus staining and gfp fluorescence was observed and had consistent patterns in independent transgenic lines. expression in these lines was localized to the hydathode region of basal leaves, as well as the points to intersection of branching cauline stems . we did not observe gus staining or gfp fluorescence in transgenic plants containing reporter constructs for the other five intergenic promoters even though race results indicate these genes are indeed expressed.

CONCLUSIONS
for the most part, the arabidopsis genome annotation has relied heavily on the presence of ests and fl-cdna sequences, along with ab initio gene predictors such as genscan  <cit>  and genemark.hmm  <cit>  to identify the genome's set of protein coding genes. both twinscan and eugene have, in direct ways, used sequence information from related species to expand gene prediction in the arabidopsis genome. we have used our high-throughput race pipeline to assess the reliability of these predictions and have verified the presence of several hundred currently un-annotated genes that were predicted by the twinscan and/or eugene programs.

our decision to use race to verify the expression and structure of these un-annotated genes was necessitated by their low level of expression and uncertain gene structures. these genes were not captured by previous large scale est sequencing efforts and were also not represented in any significant proportion in a normalized arabidopsis cdna library sequenced in house . by specifically targeting these most lowly expressed genes with 5' and 3' race, we were able to capture transcripts for over a third of the targeted un-annotated genes. however, since our targets excluded many small eugene predictions of less than  <dig> bp in length, we can not be certain that the success rates we observed with race can be extrapolated to the total set of intergenic predictions. it is unclear whether the remainder of the un-captured targets were not expressed, differed significantly from their predictions, were not present in our cdna populations at high enough levels to ensure reliable amplification or were not captured due to failure of pcr. in this study, we did not attempt to re-target un-annotated genes with our race pipeline, although previous attempts to re-target hypothetical genes by race resulted in successful amplification of ~ 40% of the re-targeted genes when using new cdna populations, suggesting that the relative abundance of signal and the heterogeneity of the cdna population may likely be a success-limiting factor .

in addition to verifying expression of novel genes by race, we have also demonstrated tissue specific activity of intergenic promoters using promoter-reporter fusions, as well as by examining enhancer trap tagged mutants obtained from cold spring harbor laboratory's trapper collection. with our promoter-reporter fusions, we observed tissue specific reporter gene expression with one of six promoters tested. with lines obtained from cshl, we observed reporter gene expression from lines tagging  <dig> of  <dig> genes. the lack of expression observed with five of our promoter-reporter lines as well as a gene trap line obtained from cshl's collection is likely due to either a very low level of expression directed by those promoters, or a very specific pattern, timing, or condition for expression that was not tested by our assays. the pools of cdna which served as our race template originated from several biotic and abiotic treatments that we did not examine in relation to our promoter-reporter constructs.

overall, we verified the expression and structure of  <dig> un-annotated genes, 27% of which do not display similarity to any annotated proteins. furthermore, nearly 50% of the genes described herein are most similar to hypothetical proteins or other proteins of unknown function. examining the putative functional roles of the remaining un-annotated genes, we can begin to speculate the reasons that many were overlooked by previous annotation efforts. single copy, lowly expressed genes such as the putative alpha  <dig> - <dig>  mannosyltransferase corresponding to twinscan prediction at.chr <dig> . <dig>  which does not have similarity with other arabidopsis genes was likely overlooked due to the lack of support from conserved est sequences. on the other hand, at.chr <dig> . <dig>  which encodes a clavata3/esr related protein and is a member of a divergent multi-gene family, was likely overlooked due to a combination of lack of est support  <cit> , and a relatively small coding size. similarly, we have identified members of a large and divergent gene family encoding cysteine rich peptides. the small size and divergent sequences of this family have contributed to their under-representation in the genome annotation  <cit> . additionally, approximately 50% of the top protein hits for the newly verified genes are to hypothetical proteins, or other poorly characterized proteins having unknown function and low expression levels. these examples underscore the limitations of gene prediction programs that still rely to a large extent on training sets derived from relatively abundantly expressed proteins. the incorporation of genomic sequence data from related organisms allows for the easier identification of such genes.

we observed alternative splicing in over 30% of the genes validated with these efforts. this percentage is comparable to that found previously in our work targeting arabidopsis hypothetical proteins, and higher than the  <dig> % of arabidopsis genes recently reported to be alternatively spliced by wang and brendel based upon large scale est analysis  <cit> . our specific race-based approach to verifying these genes, using a pool of cdna from several tissues and treatments resulted in deep sequence coverage and allowed us to capture multiple splicing isoforms. the depth of data that we obtained by sequencing up to  <dig> clones per gene also allowed us to observe splice isoforms with more regularity than past sequencing efforts. it is uncertain whether the alternatively spliced isoforms identified play a specific biological role, or are simply mis-spliced transcripts.

both twinscan and eugene performed well at identifying un-annotated genes within the arabidopsis genome. our success rate for capturing full length sequence information for these genes is in line with our past success in targeting annotated hypothetical proteins. in terms of accuracy, twinscan and eugene predicted gene structures with comparable success, though eugene predicts many smaller, single and multi-exon genes than twinscan. based upon the number of intergenic loci predicted by these programs, and our success rates when targeting these loci with 5' and 3' race, it is likely that the arabidopsis genome contains many new genes and other transcribed regions that have yet to be identified.

tair <dig> annotation
the research and analysis described within this manuscript was carried out with respect to version  <dig> of the arabidopsis annotation, as released by tigr in  <dig> . after tigr's fifth and final release, arabidopsis annotation responsibility was transferred to tair who have recently released an update to the arabidopsis annotation . this update continued to refine the arabidopsis annotation using newly submitted est and cdna sequences  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes for which we have full length sequence support are now represented in the tair <dig> annotation. indeed, with continued sequencing of ests and analysis of fl – cdnas, many of the genes described by this manuscript would eventually be incorporated into future annotation releases, but the use of comparative genomic analysis will greatly speed up the process of identifying and verifying those genes that remain un-annotated.
