BACKGROUND
about a decade ago the first large catalogs of copy number variants  in the human genome were presented
 <cit> . numerous studies later, cnvs are known to contribute to the genomic variation to a larger extent than single nucleotide polymorphisms  in terms of number of nucleotide differences
 <cit> . cnvs are defined as dna segments of variable length, up to several megabases , that varies in copy numbers in comparison to a reference genome
 <cit> . the different types of cnvs include deletions and duplications, while consequences of cnvs include e.g. altered gene dosage and regulation, changed gene structure and unmasking of recessive alleles
 <cit> . the effect of cnvs varies from being benign or neutral, to having subtle effects on disease predisposition or directly causing disease. the contribution and importance of cnvs for phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility has been repeatedly shown in human and several complex diseases such as psoriasis, crohn’s disease, type  <dig> diabetes, coronary heart disease among others have been associated with cnvs
 <cit> . also for the group of patients with intellectual disability and/or multiple congenital anomalies, cnvs have been shown to be of major importance and explain about 10-20% of these patients
 <cit> .

today, genome-wide screens for cnvs have been conducted in many different species in addition to human, including mouse, pig, cattle, goat and horse
 <cit> . these screens, both in human and other species, were enabled by methods to perform high-throughput genome scans. several methods exist to search genomes for the presence of cnvs, e.g. array-based methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization  and whole-genome snp-genotyping arrays . the higher the resolution of the arrays the smaller cnvs can be detected with more accuracy and precision. the advantage with snp arrays is that cnv detection can be performed in conjunction with genome-wide association studies  and specific algorithms have been developed to identify cnvs using snp arrays
 <cit> . more recently the next-generation sequencing technologies have emerged to detect cnvs. the necessity for cataloguing cnvs also in animals is evident considering the numerous examples of cnvs involvement in shaping the phenotype in animals
 <cit> . for example, the pigmentation phenotype dermal hyperpigmentation/fibromelanosis in chicken is caused by a complex rearrangement of the edn <dig> locus that involves two duplications
 <cit> . in dogs, the dorsal hair ridge in rhodesian and thai ridgeback is caused by a duplication encompassing three genes, fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  and this cnv predisposes to dermoid sinus
 <cit> . also, the wrinkled skin in chinese shar-pei is explained by a cnv, namely a duplication upstream of the gene encoding hyaluronic acid synthase 2
 <cit> . similarly as in ridgebacks, the cnv in shar-pei predisposes the breed to a disease, namely periodic fever syndrome
 <cit> . one example of a cnv that has been suggested to confer an advantage in early dogs during domestication is a 8 kb duplication encompassing the amylase gene amy2b <cit> . this duplication was one of the identified selection signals involving genes in starch digestion and it was shown to increase amylase activity suggesting that this duplication contributed to the ability of dogs to thrive on a starch-rich diet in comparison to wolves that lack the duplication
 <cit> .

in dogs, four cnv screens have previously been performed with the aim of identifying canine cnvs and all were based on the acgh method
 <cit> . the analyses by chen et al. of nine dogs from different breeds identified  <dig> cnv regions  using an array with an average probe spacing of  <dig>  bp
 <cit> . the contemporary study by nicholas et al. was directed towards segmentally duplicated regions of the genome and 137 mb of sequence was studied at a very high resolution 
 <cit> . this study identified  <dig> cnvrs using  <dig> dogs  and a gray wolf
 <cit> . recently two studies were reported using the same acgh that has the highest resolution of existing canine arrays up to date with  <dig>  million probes 
 <cit> . one of these studies used nine dogs and a gray wolf and identified  <dig> cnvrs
 <cit>  and the hitherto most comprehensive cnv screen in dogs was based on  <dig> dogs from  <dig> breeds and  <dig> wolves and identified  <dig> cnvrs
 <cit> . in  <dig>  the development of a high-density canine snp array  containing  <dig>  snps with an average probe spacing of 13 kb was reported
 <cit> . this array enables cnv detection simultaneously with snp genotyping, although the caninehd array was not evaluated with respect to cnvs in that study
 <cit> . in the present study, the first cnv screen based on the caninehd array is reported. using  <dig> dogs from  <dig> different breeds, the present study includes the largest number of dogs screened for cnvs hitherto. this investigation illustrates the usefulness of the caninehd array in cnv detection and demonstrates the size-range of cnvs that are detectable with the caninehd array. furthermore, this study identified novel cnvrs including some breed-specific cnvrs.

RESULTS
cnv discovery and genotyping
genome-wide cnv analysis was conducted on  <dig> dogs from  <dig> different breeds  using the illumina 170 k caninehd snp array
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> breeds included  <dig> or more samples, enabling a thorough identification of single breed cnvs, i.e. cnvs present in one breed exclusively. importantly,  <dig> breeds had never been analyzed genome-wide for the presence of cnvs before and an additional five breeds had only been genotyped for previously identified cnvs in the study by nicholas et al.
 <cit> . therefore, the present study enabled also the identification of novel cnvs.

briefly, the initial cnv discovery was performed using two different algorithms, penncnv and quantisnp
 <cit> . after quality filtering,  <dig> dogs remained and the relaxed quantisnp result file  contained  <dig> cnvs, the stringent quantisnp result file  contained  <dig> cnvs and the penncnv file contained  <dig> cnvs. in the quality-filtering step, three large regions of a total size of  <dig>  mb containing  <dig> genes  were excluded due to extensive segmentation of the data creating many overlapping cnv calls. thorough investigations of these regions were beyond the scope of this study but this observation is of importance in future cnv studies based on the caninehd array.

the identification of cnv regions  was performed by using a stringent procedure. overlapping cnvs were merged from the two programs separately, i.e. the stringent list of  <dig> cnvs identified by quantisnp were merged into  <dig> cnvrs and the  <dig> cnvs found by penncnv yielded  <dig> cnvrs. the breakpoints of each of these cnvrs were defined by the outer boundaries of the individual cnvs. finally, the cnvrs from quantisnp that did not overlap with cnvrs from penncnv, with at least 10 kb overlap were excluded. this identified a stringent list of cnvrs where the breakpoints of each of these final cnvrs were obtained from the quantisnp cnvrs. the strategy where the final list of stringent cnvrs was found by both algorithms has been recommended previously in order to reduce the false discovery rate
 <cit> .

altogether  <dig> cnvrs, distributed on the  <dig> autosomes, were identified following this process . for these stringent cnvrs, each of the  <dig> individuals were genotyped using the relaxed quantisnp file with  <dig> cnvs, hence a less strict threshold was used in cnv genotyping than in cnv discovery . of these  <dig> cnvrs,  <dig> were found in only one single sample and thereby denoted singletons . the frequency of singletons in the present study was  <dig>   singletons per sample which confirm the observation by berglund et al. of a low number of singletons per sample as compared to the conflicting results reported in nicholas et al. <cit> . since singletons are more likely to be false-positives than cnvrs that are detected in at least two independent individuals, a conservative approach was selected where singletons were excluded from further analysis. however, future cnvr screens of additional individuals could reveal if some of these singletons  in fact represent rare cnvrs instead.

the  <dig> cnvrs left after removal of singletons included  <dig> cnvrs that were defined as pure deletions ,  <dig> cnvrs were defined as pure duplications  and  <dig> as being either del/dupl meaning that both deletions or duplications were observed among the  <dig> samples. regarding the  <dig> cnvrs defined as del/dupl, 80% of the samples with a cnv harboured a duplication. the median length of all cnvrs was 195 kb and upon subdivision in deletions and duplications, the median length of deletions was 155 kb and for duplications 282 kb . deletions were smaller than duplications , as in a previous study
 <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the size difference is due to deletions being more deleterious to the genome than duplications and that there is selection against deletions
 <cit> . the smallest cnv detected in this study was a 38 kb deletion, which was one of the cnvrs verified by acgh. this deletion showed a concordant telomeric endpoint but a deviating centromeric endpoint compared to the endpoints defined in the previous study where the size of the deletion, as defined by acgh, was 63 kb
 <cit> . by using the caninehd array with a resolution of  <dig> probe/13 kb, the distribution of identified cnvrs were as follows: 19%  were smaller than 100 kb, about 64%  of the cnvrs were in the range of 100 kb – 1 mb and 17%  were larger than 1 mb in size .

*after removal of the  <dig> singletons, the remaining cnvrs were  <dig> 

comparison with published cnvrs and validation of cnvrs
the currently identified  <dig> cnvrs were compared to cnvrs defined in two previously published datasets to look for overlap between the dataset. as threshold for overlap, a minimum of at least 10 kb overlap between the currently identified cnvrs and a previously published cnvr was required
 <cit> .

using this strategy, altogether 60% of the  <dig> cnvrs were shown to overlap previously identified cnvrs . however, since the present investigation contained almost six times more samples than previous screens for cnvrs, the possibility of detecting rare cnvrs in this study was considerably higher. considering the difference in sample size, the cnvrs in this study were subdivided into three categories; cnvrs with a frequency of >5% in the population, cnvrs with a frequency of >1% and finally the rare cnvrs that were present in <1% of the screened samples. this subdivision revealed that of the cnvrs present in >5% of the population all overlapped with previously published cnvrs and as many as 73% of the cnvrs with a frequency of >1% overlapped . in the last category of cnvrs with a frequency of <1% in the population, only 33% overlapped known cnvrs.

*previously published datasets were
 <cit> .

the high proportion of cnvrs with a frequency of at least 1% in the population that overlap with previously found cnvrs suggests a high accuracy in the currently described cnv discovery procedure. in fact, an overlap of 73% is higher than the observed reproducibility of <70% for most platforms when the same sample has been analyzed in replicate experiments
 <cit> .

given that a majority of cnvrs identified herein were supported by previously identified cnvr datasets, a subset of cnvrs was selected for validation only among the novel cnvrs/single breed cnvrs . five deletions and four duplications with a size range from  <dig> to 343 kb were investigated by quantitative real-time pcr  in  <dig> samples from three breeds . eight of the nine cnvrs were validated yielding a validation rate of 89% . the unconfirmed cnvr, no.  <dig>  was a deletion present in only 2/ <dig> individuals and only one sample was available for validation. based on visual inspection of the log r ratio and the b allele frequency plots, the unavailable sample showed a more convincing deletion than the qrt-pcr-investigated sample  suggesting that cnvr no.  <dig> may still be a true cnvr. the genotype concordance between the caninehd array data and the qrt-pcr validation was 98%. overall  <dig> sample-locus combinations were tested, where  <dig> of these displayed a deletion or duplication in the caninehd cnv genotype. the results showed that two sample-locus combinations did not match . in summary, both the validation rate of cnvrs of 89% and the genotyping concordance rate between the two methods of 98% suggest that the described cnv discovery and genotyping procedure is of high accuracy and that the performance of the caninehd array in detecting cnvs is high.

cnvrs in single breeds
the strengths of this study are the high number of samples per breed and the large number of different breeds, which facilitates the identification of single breed cnvrs more accurately than in previous studies. the majority of the  <dig> cnvrs were present in a small number of breeds  and  <dig> cnvrs were present in one breed exclusively; i.e. single breed cnvrs . by comparing with the two previously published cnvr datasets
 <cit> , some of the  <dig> single breed cnvrs had been previously found in one other or multiple other breeds before and where therefore removed from the list of single breed cnvrs along with a few cnvrs where previous studies lacked information about which breed was affected . consequently, a total of  <dig> strictly defined single breed cnvrs remained and these were found in  <dig> different breeds . likewise, in the study by berglund et al.,  <dig> single breed cnvrs had been identified, but  <dig> of these were found in other breeds when comparing with the  <dig> presently identified cnvrs . hence the single breed cnvrs defined by berglund et al., was reduced to  <dig> single breed cnvrs
 <cit> . this illustrates that further investigations are necessary to fully understand which cnvrs are found in which breed and which cnvrs are true single breed cnvrs.

*the single breed cnvr no.  <dig> was previously found by berglund et al. in the same breed
 <cit> .

single breed cnvrs are of particular interest if it is fixed in the breed since it could be involved in breed specific characteristics. in the study by berglund et al. no fixed single breed cnvrs were identified in the two 10-sample breeds included in the study and they suggested that breed specific cnvrs are most often not involved in breed specific characteristics
 <cit> . in the stringent list of  <dig> single breeds cnvrs identified herein , the frequencies of the cnvrs were in the range of 17-42%, hence our results confirm previous suggestions
 <cit> . the frequency of cnvrs in a breed is however not an exact measurement since it can depend on e.g. the discovery procedure, filtering criteria and whether the size of the cnvr is close to the detection limit of the array.

cnvrs and the effect on genes
examining the cnvrs for the presence of genes, the list of  <dig>  genes from ensembl canfam <dig> was filtered for human orthologous genes leaving  <dig>  genes
 <cit> . furthermore, genes located on chromosome x, unknown or mitochondria were first removed and subsequently all non-unique dog entries and all non-unique human entries leaving a total gene list of  <dig>  1: <dig> human-dog orthologous genes. the start and end point of the cnvrs were analyzed for overlap with the start and endpoint of the genes with a minimum of 1 bp overlap. a 1 bp overlap was chosen due to the rough estimates of cnvr breakpoints and consequently some of the resulting overlapping genes located in the vicinity of the breakpoints could in fact be non-overlapping but in close proximity or alternatively be completely within the cnvr.

analysis of the  <dig> cnvrs revealed that  <dig> cnvrs overlapped  <dig> genes  while the remaining  <dig> cnvrs contained no protein coding genes. duplications overlapping genes outnumber deletions  , which is a similar observation as previously reported
 <cit> .

go analysis
the  <dig> 1: <dig> orthologous genes affected by cnvrs  were analyzed with respect to gene enrichment using the g:gost tool from g:profiler
 <cit> . in the analysis, the human gene ids corresponding to the canine genes were analyzed against all  <dig>  1: <dig> human-dog orthologous genes that were used as background. the results were corrected for multiple testing using g:gost native method g:scs. the most significant results in the domain molecular function was "olfactory receptor activity"  and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enriched genes belonged to the "olfactory transduction" pathway  . this enrichment of olfactory receptor activity genes in cnvrs in dogs has been previously reported
 <cit> . when all olfactory receptor genes were removed , no significant enriched category was obtained and in the domain molecular function the highest enriched gene category was "riboflavin transporter activity" with p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> 

of the stringent list of  <dig> single breed cnvrs,  <dig> cnvrs overlapped in total  <dig> genes of which  <dig> genes were in duplications and two genes were in deletions . a gene enrichment analysis using the stringent list of  <dig> single breed cnvrs showed no statistically significant result neither when all  <dig> genes were analyzed nor when the  <dig> genes present in single breed duplications were analyzed separately. of the two deleted genes, pde3b was within the estimated cnvr boundary, and  <dig> of the  <dig> duplicated genes were within the estimated cnvr boundaries . the cnvr, no.  <dig>  encompassing pde3b was found to affect 4/ <dig> finnish spitz and in all individuals a heterozygous deletion was detected. this finding could be of importance for the occurrence of diabetes mellitus in this breed since knockout of the gene in mice has been shown to affect energy homeostasis, including altered insulin secretion and regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis
 <cit> . one interesting gene residing completely within the duplication cnvr no.  <dig>  is nov which is heterozygously duplicated along with additional ten genes in two dogs of the standard poodle breed . nov has been shown to have a selective pro-apoptotic activity towards adrenocortical cells in human and reduced expression and protein levels has been observed in childhood adrenocortical tumours
 <cit> . these findings could have implications for standard poodles since this breed has a genetic predisposition towards addison’s disease, which is characterized by insufficient production of hormones by the adrenal glands.

dosage sensitive genes and novel cnvrs
in a recent study of cnvrs in human, a number of human genomic regions were defined that hitherto do not contain any cnvrs despite numerously screened individuals
 <cit> . these regions were denoted copy-number stable and contained  <dig> human genes that were suggested to be dosage sensitive. the list of  <dig> canine genes  that were copy-number variable in the present study was investigated against the list of  <dig> human dosage-sensitive genes in order to find possible important candidate genes for disease/phenotypic characteristics in dogs. this revealed that 23/ <dig> canine copy-number-variable genes are suggested to be dosage sensitive in human . eleven of these genes are olfactory receptor genes and these are all located within one cnvr, no.  <dig>  which is the cnvr that affect the highest number of breeds, namely 25/ <dig> breeds. the remaining  <dig> genes were located in eight cnvrs that were all affecting not more than three breeds. several genes could be of interest for future studies, e.g. one noteworthy gene is sgpp <dig>  located in a duplication found in 10/ <dig> chinese shar-pei and in 4/ <dig> eurasian of all the screened breeds and was one of the rare cnvr that almost reached fixation in one breed. sgpp <dig> is involved in inflammation and increased expression of the gene has been observed in skin lesions of patients with psoriasis suggesting that sgpp <dig> may play a role in pro-inflammatory signaling
 <cit> . this connection to inflammation could be of importance since the chinese shar-pei breed is known to suffer from auto-inflammatory disease
 <cit> .

*genes in bold are completely within the estimated cnvr boundaries, see also additional file
1: table s <dig> 

in addition to the list of canine genes that have previously been seen to be dosage-sensitive in human
 <cit> , the present study identified  <dig> novel cnvrs where  <dig> were singletons and were therefore not considered in detail. the remaining  <dig> novel cnvrs  were not found in more than three breeds and  <dig> of these novel cnvrs were single breed cnvrs. there were  <dig> genes present in  <dig> of the  <dig> novel cnvrs and seven of these genes were suggested to be dosage sensitive in human, e.g. sgpp <dig>  the list of novel cnvrs constitutes a resource for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the present investigation is the first screen for canine cnvs using the caninehd array and thereby this study demonstrates the performance of the caninehd array in cnv detection in addition to snp genotyping. the procedure described herein identified  <dig> cnvrs with high stringency where the smallest cnvr was 38 kb. a total of  <dig> novel cnvrs were identified that contribute to the catalogue of known canine cnvs and this also illustrates the importance of continuing the identification of canine cnvrs and the necessity of including a large number of samples and previously unscreened breeds in order to obtain a comprehensive catalog of canine cnvrs. furthermore, a list of  <dig> confidently defined single breed cnvrs were found of which as many as  <dig> were novel cnvrs. these single breed cnvrs could be of interest for further genotype-phenotype analysis although the number of fixed single breed cnvrs are rare as previously shown
 <cit> . hence, breed-specific characteristics are most likely not hidden among hitherto unknown cnvs or alternatively are smaller than the cnv detection limit of approximately 50 kb on the caninehd array. nevertheless, there is still the possibility of having disease-predisposing cnvs among the growing list of defined cnvrs, which of course are much less likely to be fixed in a breed. a final contribution herein to future studies were the identification of  <dig> copy number variable canine genes that have been suggested as being dosage-sensitive in human and as such are remarkably interesting for future phenotype association analysis in dogs.
