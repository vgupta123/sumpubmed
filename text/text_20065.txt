BACKGROUND
farmers use pesticide  for the protection of crop  <cit> . chlorinated aromatic compounds  have been widely used in industrial, agricultural and domestic products such as pesticides, soil fumigants, disinfectants, toilet deodorants, solvents, and also used as precursors for the production of dyes  <cit> .

as a result of worldwide extensive use, cacs are widespread and released as environmental pollutants in coastal marine sediments, freshwater lake sediments, sewage sludge, waste water, groundwater, rivers and estuaries, and soils  <cit> . due to their persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation potential, cacs are subject to regulation in most of the developed countries  <cit> . the main environmental impact of pesticide is caused by their mobilization and transport from agriculture fields to pollute soils, sediment, water and also percolating through the soil and reaching the ground water  <cit> .

pentachloronitrobenzene  is an important group of organochlorine fungicide which has been widely used either for seed dressing or for soil treatment to control a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi in crops  <cit> . hexachlorobenzene  is also used as a fungicide and is a side product of industrial emission related to the manufacture of chlorinated solvents and pesticides  <cit> . both organochlorine fungicide  are widespread and found in every environmental compartment i.e. soil, water, and air  <cit> . lipophilic nature of these compounds results in their bioaccumulation at different trophic levels via the food chain, thereby increasing risk to different living beings  <cit> . the accumulation of organochlorine pesticide is due to their resistance to both biotic and abiotic degradation in environmental condition  <cit> . public concern has prompted the need for removal of these contaminants from the environment. therefore, there has been an increase in effort to remove pcnb, hcb and their possible intermediates from the environment either by abiological or biological means during the past decades. the biotransformation products of pcnb include pentachloroaniline , tetrachloroaniline , trichloroaniline , dichloroaniline , chloroaniline , pentachlorophenol , pentachlorothiophenol, pentachlorothioanisole and pentachloromethyl-phenyl sulfoxide  <cit> . the biotransformation products of hcb are pentachlorobenzene , tetrachlorobenzene , trichlorobenzene , dichlorobenzene , pentachlorophenol , tetrachlorohydroquinone  and dichlorohydroquinone   <cit> . some of these polychlorinated and their nitro or amino derivatives metabolites such as pecb, tecb, tcb, dcb, peca, teca, tca, dca and ca can be determined by gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector   <cit> . however, it is difficult to identify some of chlorophenolics and chloroquinolics intermediates such as pcp, tetrachlorophenol , trichlorophenol , dichlorophenol  and tech, dich by gc due to their relative polarity, low vapour pressure, chemical reactivity, causing adsorption and tailing of the chromatographic peaks  <cit> . therefore, for determination of these cacs and chemically different nature  of the putative intermediates, there is a need to develop simple, quick extraction and analytical method. in the present study we report a high performance liquid chromatography  method for determination of pcnb, hcb and their possible metabolites.

RESULTS
solvents selection for extraction
the solvents were selected for extraction of pcnb, hcb and their possible metabolites by dissolving increasing concentrations of compounds up to their maximum solubility into different organic solvents. solubility tests revealed that all compounds were best soluble in ethyl acetate whereas hcb was only soluble in hexane. the selected solvents were used for the determination of extraction efficiency of pcnb, hcb and their possible metabolites.

extraction efficiency and quantification
quantitative determination of pcnb and hcb were performed by comparing peak areas of spiked soil with that of standards. calibration graphs were constructed by plotting peak areas versus pcnb and hcb concentrations. five working concentrations of pcnb and hcb compounds equivalent to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg were added to  <dig> ml ethyl acetate and hexane respectively and analyzed in triplicate. a best linearity was found from the concentrations  <dig> - <dig>  μg ml- <dig> as indicated by correlation coefficient of  <dig>  for both pcnb and hcb. recoveries were studied by using five concentrations from  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  the mean recoveries and relative standard deviation  of pcnb and hcb are presented in the table  <dig>  the recoveries were found 98% for pcnb and 97% for hcb compounds.

to determine any interference caused by the endogenous and soil component, a blank soil sample was analyzed. no interference was identified from the soil sample. the limit of detection  were also calculated by applying the 3s criterion equation: y-yb = 3sb, where as 'y' is lowest concentration signal and 'yb' is a blank signal, i.e. lod corresponds to a signal equal to  <dig> times of standard deviation of the background noise. the detection limit for pcnb was found to be  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> and  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> for hcb. similar exercise was carried out for both pcnb and hcb from msm. result indicated that extraction efficiency of pcnb and hcb from msm was very close to the extraction efficiency as determined for the soil sample .

uv-vis absorption spectra and retention time of pcnb, hcb and their possible intermediates
identification of any aromatic compound by hplc can be performed by comparing the uv-vis absorption spectra and retention time with the authentic standards. the retention time and uv-vis absorption spectra of pcnb, hcb and their possible intermediates are given in the table  <dig>  the proposed method is also well suitable for the identification of chlorophenolics and chloroquinolics intermediates such as pcp, tecp, tech, tcp, and dich.

method validation
determination of pcnb, hcb depletion rate and identification of metabolites
for validation of satisfactory results presented here, we applied this extraction and analytical method to determine pcnb, hcb depletion rates and also identification of metabolites from the pcnb and hcb enriched soil sample under anaerobic condition for up to a five months incubation period. samples were drawn, extracted and analyzed at regular intervals by hplc to determine the rate of depletion and appearance of intermediates. it was found that the rate of pcnb and hcb depletion increased with the time of incubation . pcnb degradation intermediates viz; pentachloroaniline , tetrachloroaniline , trichloroaniline  and dichloroaniline  from anaerobic enriched soil sample have been identified by hplc with the retention time  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  min and uv-absorption spectra  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  nm . there are few reports on degradation of pcnb by anaerobic mixed culture via reductive dechlorination under anaerobic condition  <cit> . similarly, hcb degradation intermediates from anaerobic enrichment were identified as pentachlorobenzene , tetrachlorobenzene , trichlorobenzene  and dichlorobenzene  with the retention time  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  min and uv-absorption spectra  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  nm . the same hcb degradation metabolites have also been identified by reductive dechlorination in soil sediment  <cit> . there is one report on hcb degradation by nocardioides sp. strain pd <dig>  the identification of produced intermediates such as pentachlorophenol , tetrachlorohydroquinone ,  <dig>  6-dichlorohydroquinone  performed by gc after acetylation with acetic anhydride  <cit> . in the proposed method of identification of such phenolic intermediates by hplc, there is no need of derivatization. the retention time and uv-vis absorption spectra of chlorophenolic and chloroquinolic standards such as pentachlorophenol , tetrachlorohydroquinone  and dichlorohydroquinone  was found to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  minute and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  nm .

discussion
due to high electronegative properties of pcnb, hcb and their intermediates, the identification is possible by gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector  and mass-spectroscopy   <cit> . although, the detection efficiency by these methods is good, yet there are several drawbacks like the need to derivatize such as methylation, acetylation and pentafluorobenzylation and the loss of compounds by thermal decomposition  <cit> . similarly, there are a few reports describing extraction procedures for pcnb and hcb but they are cumbersome as they required additional steps, of sample cleanup or sample enrichment followed by quantitative determination by liquid chromatographic analysis  <cit> . in the present work, solubility analysis was carried out which indicated that all compounds were highly soluble in ethyl acetate, except hcb which was soluble in hexane. based on their solubility, ethyl acetate and hexane were used for extraction of pcnb and hcb respectively from the soil sample as well as from the msm. the proposed liquid-liquid extraction and hplc analysis procedure showed good recoveries of 98% with  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> lod for pcnb and 97% with  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> lod for hcb without the need to cleanup the extracted samples. in the proposed hplc method there is no need for the derivatization such as methylation, acetylation or pentafluorobenzylation for the detection of chlorophenolic and chloroquinolic intermediates. the proposed liquid-liquid extraction and analytical method is one of the most suitable for the application to any toxic organochlorine residue determination from different environmental compartment such as soil, sediment and sludge.

CONCLUSIONS
a rapid, sensitive and simple analytical method was developed for the determination of polychlorinated fungicides such as pcnb, hcb and their possible intermediates including chlorophenolic as well as chloroquinolic intermediates using hplc techniques. the developed method gave good recoveries, good peaks resolution and sensitive detection levels without internal interference.
