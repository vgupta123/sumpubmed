BACKGROUND
the yeast candida albicans is the major cause of opportunistic fungal infections in humans. in case of systemic infections, the mortality rate can reach 50%  <cit> . azoles, which target the fungal p <dig> cytochrome 14alpha-lanosterol demethylase encoded by the erg <dig> gene, are the most commonly used antifungal molecules for candidosis treatment  <cit> . unfortunately azoles only have a fungistatic effect and therefore have allowed the emergence of multidrug resistance strains in patients  <cit> . there are two main groups of mutations which cause azole resistance in candida albicans. the first group directly targets erg <dig>  either in cis by creating erg <dig> alleles which encode a protein variant insensitive to azoles  <cit> , or in trans by increasing the expression of erg <dig> through gain of function mutations in the upc <dig> gene, which encode a transcription factor regulating erg <dig> <cit> . the second type acts by increasing the expression of membrane transporters which export the drugs and therefore decrease their intracellular concentration  <cit> . two types of drug resistance, called mdr and cdr respectively, are distinguished, depending on the type of transporters which is involved. in most of the clinical isolates studied so far, the cells present either a drug resistance of the mdr or the cdr type  <cit> . only in rare occurrences, the two kind of resistance can be observed in the same cells  <cit> . the mdr resistant cells overexpress the mdr <dig> permease encoding gene, which is under the control of the mrr <dig> and cap <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . mdr <dig> is homologous to the saccharomyces cerevisiae flr <dig> transporter, which is involved in the detoxification of several drugs, including the antifungal benomyl  <cit> . the cdr resistant strains overexpress two abc transporters encoding genes, cdr <dig> and cdr <dig>  which are homologous to the pleiotropic drug resistance transporter pdr <dig> from s. cerevisiae <cit> . these transporters are major determinants of the resistance to fluconazole, the most widely used azole. their expression is controlled mainly by the tac <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . most of the cdr resistant strains present a loss of heterozygocity and/or aneuploidy at the tac <dig> locus, combined to gain of function mutations of tac <dig> <cit> . microarray and proteomic analyses identified about  <dig> genes which are co-overexpressed with cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> in all cdr clinical isolates examined  <cit> . chromatine immunoprecipitation and tac1Δ strain analyses identified the tac <dig> regulon, which is composed of about ten genes mostly involved in membrane properties, including cdr1cdr <dig>  the phospholipid transferase gene pdr <dig>  the putative flippase gene rta <dig> or the putative sphingosine kinase gene lcb <dig> <cit> .

the recently developed rna sequencing  technology is revolutionizing our ability to analyse eukaryotic transcriptomes  <cit>  and has given a chance to unravel the actual complexity of the cdr phenotype better. rna seq has been proven to be more sensitive than microarrays  <cit> . rna seq also results in more accurate measurements of gene expression changes  <cit> . moreover, relative to standard microarray approaches, rna seq and tiling arrays provide crude measurement and identification of transcripts, without any a priori on which region of the genome is transcribed  <cit> . hence, two recent rna seq and one tiling array analyses of the candida albicans transcriptome identified more than  <dig> new transcripts, many of which are expressed in a condition-specific way  <cit> . most of these transcripts do not have a coding potential and may be long non coding regulatory rnas.

in this study, we have used rna seq to analyse the transcriptomes of a cdr strain and its isogenic drug susceptible counterpart. in addition to the genes previously shown to be associated with cdr, we could identify about  <dig> genes which were overexpressed in the cdr strain. in particular, we show that the transcription factor encoding gene czf <dig>  which is involved in hyphal transition and white/opaque switching, is induced together with cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> in gu <dig>  czf <dig> is likely to play an important role in cdr acquisition since its overexpression is a general feature of all the cdr strains that we have tested, but was not found in mdr strains. moreover, its deletion caused susceptibility to several unrelated drugs. additionally, the inactivation of czf <dig> increased the resistance of the cells to cell wall perturbating agents, through the overexpression of beta glucan synthesis genes. we propose that czf <dig> has a positive role on drug resistance and a negative role on cell wall integrity. finally, we characterized a new transcribed region, previously undetected, just upstream of the tac <dig> gene, which strongly suggests that tac <dig> is subjected to complex post-transcriptional regulations, yet to be characterized. taken together, our results open several new ways to our understanding of drug resistance acquisition in candida albicans and may provide new targets for antifungal therapies.

RESULTS
transcriptional landscape of gu <dig> and gu <dig> strains
in order to conduct a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of cdr versus drug susceptible c. albicans cells, we performed high-throughput sequencing of cdna made from poly rnas obtained from the gu <dig> and gu <dig> strains. gu <dig> is a fluconazole susceptible clinical isolate obtained from an early infection episode. gu <dig> is the corresponding fluconazole resistant clinical isolate obtained from later episode in the same patient treated with fluconazole. gu <dig> and gu <dig> are therefore supposed to be isogenic and mainly differ by their resistance to fluconazole. gu <dig> has been characterised as a cdr strain, showing overexpression of cdr <dig> and cdr <dig>  as compared with gu <dig>  <cit> . for each strain, two biologically independent samples of rnas were analysed by rna seq. we obtained  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> unique mappable reads for gu <dig>  and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> mappable reads for gu <dig> . as noticed in previous rna seq studies, the background was very low, with no or few reads mapped in intergenic regions. the correlation coefficient between the biological replicates was very high . we could detect expression for  <dig>  of the  <dig> orfs annotated in the cgd. the  <dig> orfs which were undetected in our experiments are mostly dubious orfs or gene without clear function . we arbitrarily grouped the expressed orfs in five categories: very high expression , high expression , medium expression , low expression  and very low expression . these categories contained 3%, 20%, 57%, 12% and 8% of the genes, respectively. as described previously, the “very high expression” category was enriched in genes encoding ribosomal proteins, glycolytic enzymes, translation regulators, histones and components of respiratory complexes. the “high expression” category was enriched in genes encoding enzymes involved in various metabolisms. the “medium” and “low” expression categories did not show any significant functional enrichment.

we used our data to define the boundaries of each transcript, as described previously  <cit> . we compared the 5’ and 3’utr predictions that we obtained with the annotation set up by a previous rna seq analysis of the candida albicans reference strain sc <dig>  <cit> . we found no significant difference in the two annotations for more than 75% of the genes, indicating that our data is reliable and that there is no global change in 5’ and 3’utr length between those strains. still, we had some significant discrepancies with the annotation from bruno et al. for about thirty genes, which showed much longer 5’ or 3’ utr according to our data . this is for instance the case of tac1adaec and czf <dig> . these genes did not show any particular functional enrichment. noteworthy, we did not detect significant differences in the size of transcripts between the gu <dig> and gu <dig> strains, with the notable and sole exception of tac <dig> which presented an extension in 5’ which was apparently specific for the azole resistant strain . 

finally, we used our data to detect new transcripts. to do so, the reads from the gu <dig> and gu <dig> strains were summed and used to identify regions of the genome with a minimum coverage of at least  <dig> reads/nucleotides  for a stretch of at least  <dig> nucleotides. with these criteria, we identified  <dig> new transcription units,  <dig> of which partially or totally overlapped new transcribed regions recently identified by rna seq  <cit>  or tiling arrays  <cit>  . we named these new transcripts nguts for “new gu strains transcripts”. the median size of nguts was  <dig> nucleotides. the majority of these nguts did not contain any obvious orf and are therefore likely to be non-coding rnas.

transcripts differentially expressed in the drug resistant and the drug susceptible strains
the identification of genes differentially expressed in gu <dig> and gu <dig> was performed combining two different statistical methods  and using the gene annotations from the cgd, the new transcribed regions defined by previous studies  <cit>  and the new transcribed regions defined in this study . we found  <dig> genes significantly overexpressed in gu <dig> and  <dig> genes which were underexpressed in this strain compared to gu <dig> .

comparison with previous microarray experiments
we first compared our results with the one obtained in a previous study, which used microarrays to analyse the transcriptomes of  <dig> different cdr isolates  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes induced in gu <dig>   <dig>  were previously shown to be overexpressed in one or several of these cdr clinical isolates . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were found overexpressed in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> cdr strains, suggesting that most of the genes identified in our rna seq analyses are general features of the cdr isolates. these genes include the cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> abc transporter encoding genes, together with the tac <dig> gene encoding their transcriptional regulator. remarkably, all the previously identified targets of tac1p are found in our list, including pdr16rta <dig> and lcb <dig> 

of the  <dig> genes underexpressed in gu <dig>   <dig>  were previously shown to be repressed in cdr isolates. this includes genes involved in iron and metal homeostasis  and amino acid metabolism .

orfs not previously associated with cdr
we identified  <dig> orfs which were overexpressed in gu <dig> and were not previously associated with cdr phenotype. about half of them  are uncharacterized and little information is available on their function.

among the characterized genes , some of them were known as playing important roles in morphogenesis, hyphal growth and white/opaque switch. this is the case of the transcription factors czf <dig> and sfl <dig>  the kinase sch <dig>  the membrane sensor gpr <dig> and its target ece <dig>  the signal transducer srr <dig>  the white specific gene of unknown function adaec and the cytoplasmic protein wh <dig>  some other induced genes are involved in cell wall maintenance and cell adhesion, like the mannosyl-transferase mnn <dig> or the adhesion protein als <dig>  finally, two transporters encoding genes belong to this list: yor <dig>  which is homologous to an oligomycin resistance gene of s. cerevisiae and hgt <dig>  which encodes a glycerol permease involved in osmotic stress response. remarkably, four of the cdr induced genes  present the particularity to have a long transcribed region upstream of the start codon according to our rna seq data, which could be interpreted either as long 5’ utr or as new non coding transcripts .

fifty genes were shown for the first time to be downregulated in gu <dig>  of these,  <dig>  are uncharacterized. among the verified orfs , we could find the gene encoding the abc transporter cdr <dig>  which is homologous to cdr <dig> and cdr <dig>  and rta <dig>  which is homologous to the tac <dig> target, rta <dig>  we also found in this group additional genes involved in copper and iron homeostasis  and genes encoding extracellular proteins . two genes encoding potential steroid targets, ebp <dig> and cbp <dig>  were also underexpressed in gu <dig>  which is interesting considering the previously established link between steroid exposure and cdr response  <cit> .

to support these results, we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses for  <dig> repressed and  <dig> induced genes, using actin as a reference and cdr <dig> as a positive control . these experiments confirmed the rna seq results, except for ebp <dig> and orf <dig> , for which no difference of expression was detected by this method.

new transcripts differentially expressed in gu <dig> and gu <dig> strains
among the new transcripts identified in this study,  <dig> were overexpressed and  <dig> underexpressed in gu <dig> compared with gu <dig>  four of the five induced transcripts were located immediately in 5’ of an induced orf. transcript ngut-chr4- <dig>  was in 5’ of czf <dig> , ngut-chr5- <dig> was in 5’ of tac <dig> , ngut-chr2- <dig> was in 5’ of adaec  and ngut-chr3- <dig> , was close to orf <dig> . the fifth transcript, ngut-chr3- <dig> , is located just upstream of the aaf <dig> gene, which encodes an adhesin and which is not induced in the gu <dig> strain.

all the new transcripts which were repressed in gu <dig> are located at more than 1 kb from the adjacent orfs. ngut-chrr- <dig>  and  <dig>  belong to the same cluster of non coding rnas. ngut-chr4- <dig>  is located in a zone rich in trna genes. ngut-chrr- <dig>  is close to a long terminal repeat.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses for  <dig> repressed and  <dig> induced nguts, using actin as a reference confirmed the rna seq results, except for ngut-chr3- <dig> and ngut-chrr- <dig> .

new roles of the czf1p transcription factor in multidrug resistance and cell wall maintenance
czf <dig> deletion alters drug resistance
to go further in our investigation of the roles of new genes involved in the acquisition of cdr, we selected three of the induced genes, mnn <dig> , czf <dig> , and als <dig> , and performed drug sensitivity profiling with the corresponding null mutants . serial dilutions of cells were grown on agar plates and minimum inhibitory concentration  was determined by broth microdilution assay with different concentrations of flc, terbinafin , anisomycin , amphotericin b , and ketoconazole  . the homozygous mutants for mnn <dig> and als <dig> did not exhibit any significant differences with their respective wild type strains. however, czf <dig> null mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to flc, ter and ans in comparison to its wild type strain . mic <dig> of the czf <dig> null strain was calculated as  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  μg/ml for flc, ter, and ans, respectively, which was ~  <dig> fold less than its isogenic wild type . notably, the strain heterozygous for the deletion of czf <dig> had wild type levels of drug resistance . czf <dig> nulls did not show any differential susceptibility to amb or ktc .

czf <dig> deletion does not impair the expression of standard mdr and cdr actors
to understand the molecular basis of the drug sensitivity described above, we measured, in the wild type and in strains mutated for one or both copies of czf <dig>  the expression levels of major actors of multidrug resistance pathways  or of genes changing expression in gu <dig> in our experiments . final point semi-quantitative rt-pcr did not show any difference in the level of these genes in the wild type and in strains mutated for one or both copies of czf <dig>  indicating that czf <dig> does not act on the steady state expression of mdr and cdr actors in a laboratory strain .

czf <dig> negatively controls beta-glucan synthesis and resistance to cell wall perturbation agents
the sensitivity of the czf <dig> null mutant to various drugs prompted us to test the phenotype of this mutant in presence of drugs targeting the calcineurin pathway or cell wall integrity. calcineurin has been shown to play multiple roles in stress responses including resistance to flc and to membrane perturbation  <cit> . it has also been shown to influence the dimorphic switch, a process which is controlled by czf <dig>  <cit> . we tested growth of wild type, czf1Δ/czf1Δ or czf1Δ/czf <dig> strains in presence of the membrane perturbation agent sds and the specific calcineurin inhibitor fk <dig>  we observed that the double mutant was more sensitive to these drugs than the single mutant and the wild type strain . we tested the expression of several direct or indirect actors of the calcineurin pathway . we did not detect any effect of the partial or total inactivation of czf <dig> on the expression of these genes . reciprocally, we tested the expression of czf <dig> in various strains mutated for one or several actors of the calcineurin pathway. again, we did not see any effects of the inactivation of the calcineurin pathway on the steady-state expression of czf <dig> .

in c. albicans, the cell wall plays important roles in virulence, defense against host and resistance to some drugs  <cit> . surprisingly, we observed that the czf1Δ/czf1Δ strain was more resistant than the wild type to congo red  . the heterozygous mutant exhibited an intermediate phenotype , suggesting a dosage effect for the role of czf <dig> in cell wall maintenance. congo red is considered to act on the cell wall glucan structure. therefore, we measured the expression of the three beta  <dig> -glucan synthase encoding genes  in presence and absence of czf <dig> . we observed no or few differences in gsc <dig> and gsl <dig> expression. in contrast, we observed a clear overexpression of gsl <dig> in the strains deleted for one or two copies of czf <dig>  compared to the wild type. this result suggests that czf <dig> negatively controls the expression of this gene and that the resistance to congo red that we observed in the czf <dig> mutants could be linked to the partial deregulation of beta-glucan synthesis. interestingly, a defect in beta-glucan activity has been shown to cause sensitivity to many different drugs, including azoles  <cit> . however, the expression of gsl1gsc <dig> and gsl <dig>  tested by rna-seq and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, was unchanged in the gu <dig> strain as compared with gu <dig> .

czf <dig> overexpression is commonly associated with cdr acquisition
to check whether an upregulation of czf <dig> is a general phenomenon among drug resistant clinical isolates, we examined the expression of czf <dig> in six azole sensitive  and azole resistant  matched pairs . the first group of as/ar isolates includes strains  in which the ar isolate is characterized by the overexpression of cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> . the second group included strains  where ar isolates showed an overexpression of mdr <dig> . our quantitative rt-pcr data revealed that czf <dig> was upregulated in two ar isolates of the cdr group and one of the mdr group  . in contrast, the levels of czf <dig> remained unchanged in the other pairs of isolates . we next analyzed the expression of czf <dig> in a series of clinical isolates acquired from a single hiv-infected patient over the period of two years where the levels of flc resistance of the strain increased over 200-fold  <cit>  . we observed a gradual overexpression of czf <dig>  which followed the increase in flc resistance of those isolates . 

taken together these results strongly suggest that the overexpression of czf <dig> is generally correlated to the acquisition of the cdr phenotype, with the notable exception of the dsy544/dsy <dig> pair.

discussion
in this work, we have used rna-seq to analyze the transcriptome changes associated with cdr acquisition in a pair of clinical isolates in the human pathogen c. albicans. our aim was to obtain an accuracy, sensitivity and completion unreached by previous microarray analyses of the same strains. based on previous rna-seq studies, we expected a better detection of mrnas and of their expression changes, the identification of unannotated transcripts possibly up or down regulated in the cdr strain, and the detection of changes in the 5’ and 3’ utr lengths compared with available annotations. indeed, our data pointed out about one hundred genes, which were either induced or repressed in the gu <dig> strain compared with gu <dig>  and which were not associated to cdr acquisition by previous studies. although we identified more than one thousand new transcripts , very few of them changed expression in the cdr strain. four of these new transcripts were found to be induced in gu <dig>  but their position just upstream of annotated genes, which are similarly induced in gu <dig>  raises doubts on their actual existence as independent transcripts, or as long, previously undetected, 5’ utr of the downstream gene.

the analyses of this large amount of data led to two important conclusions, which open new perspectives for our understanding of multidrug resistance in this pathogenic yeast. first, we revised the annotation of the tac <dig> genomic region, identifying a new transcribed region in 5’ of the tac <dig> mrna. second, we suggested new roles for the czf <dig> transcription factor in cdr acquisition and cell wall maintenance.

a new transcribed region upstream of tac <dig> and its potential impact on tac <dig> expression regulation
rna seq and tiling arrays experiments have allowed the systematic annotation of transcript boundaries in three yeast species: s. cerevisiaec. albicans and c. parapsilosis <cit> . in all three species, the 5’ and 3’utr have been shown to be generally short, with an average size ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides. however, in all these species, many exceptions have been described. in c. albicans, about  <dig> genes have 5’ utr longer than 500 bp  <cit> . interestingly, this group is enriched in genes encoding transcriptional regulators and genes involved in filamentation. these include the czf <dig> transcription factor encoding gene, which was induced in our experiments and which has a 5’utr of about 2 kb . this observation is also true in mammals in which many genes with long 5’utr encode regulators and proto-oncogenes  <cit> . long 5’utr usually have important roles in the post-transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of several transcription factors, including gcn <dig> , yap <dig>  and yap <dig> , is regulated by the presence of short upstream orfs  in their long 5’utr region, which exert negative or positive actions on the translation of the main orf or on mrna stability, depending on the cellular context  <cit> . recent studies have identified about  <dig> genes containing potential uorfs in this species  <cit> .

as mentioned in the introduction, tac <dig> encodes the major transcriptional regulator of cdr genes. its own mrna expression is co-induced with those of its main targets, cdr <dig> and cdr <dig>  possibly due to an autoregulatory loop  <cit> . in previous transcript annotations, tac <dig> mrna was described as having a 5’utr of about  <dig> nt  <cit> . our rna seq data detected a transcribed region up to 1 kb upstream of the tac <dig> start codon, which was apparently specific of the gu <dig> strain . this could be interpreted as a new transcript expressed only in the cdr strain, as an alternative transcription start site  specific for gu <dig>  or as the normal tss of tac <dig> which could not be detected in drug sensitive strains because expression of tac <dig> in those strains and rna-seq coverage in previous experiments and in this study were too low. 5’race and northern blot experiments could resolve if it is an alternative tss or a new transcript. however, the strong correlation between the expression of the two regions  suggests that tac <dig> mrna presents, at least in the gu <dig> strain, an unusually long 5’utr, which was previously not detected. considering the important roles of long 5’utr in translation regulation, this opens exciting new perspectives to the post-transcriptional regulation of tac <dig> expression, which was poorly investigated until now. especially, we observed in this 5’utr the presence of one large  uorf in the same orientation and phase than the tac <dig> orf , which suggests the existence of regulatory mechanisms similar to the ones described for gcn4yap <dig> or yap <dig> in s. cerevisiae. the analysis of ribosome occupancy at tac <dig> mrna in cdr matched pairs, either measured by global ribosome profiling or by polysomes gradients, will give information on this potential regulation. moreover, a long 5’utr would have important implications on the way we consider the transcriptional regulation of tac <dig>  indeed, yeast enhancers are usually located close upstream to the tss. since 5’utr regions are also limited in size, people tended to look for dna consensus motifs within 800 bp upstream of the start codon of the genes. the fact that the actual tss of tac <dig> would be located about  <dig>  kb upstream of all previous estimations also change the potential position of its promoter region. for instance, it was shown that tac <dig> binds its own promoter, which led to the hypothesis that it is regulated through a positive auto-regulatory loop  <cit> . however, this hypothesis was challenged by the fact that the two potential tac <dig> binding motifs  in this region were located more than 1 kb upstream of tac <dig> atg. in the annotation proposed in figure  <dig>  these dre would be located very close to the tss, which strongly supports their functional role in the activation of tac <dig> expression. 

new roles for czf <dig> in cdr acquisition and cell wall maintenance
czf <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor mostly known for its role in the epigenetic white/opaque switch, which controls cell and colony morphogenesis and properties  <cit> . czf <dig> acts synergistically to wor <dig> and wor <dig> transcription factors, and antagonistically to efg <dig>  to promote the opaque state. czf <dig> also has a role in hyphal growth, . czf <dig> mutants filament normally under standard filamentation induction conditions, but they are defective in hyphal development in anaerobic conditions  <cit> . this phenotype is dependent on the composition of the media, for instance in terms of carbon source. the positive role of czf <dig> on hypoxic filamentation is under the negative control of the tor pathway and more specifically, of the sch <dig> kinase  <cit> . as for the white/opaque switch, efg <dig> plays an important and complex role in filamentation. in aerobic conditions, it is a positive regulator of hyphal development, whereas in hypoxia, it counteracts the positive action of czf <dig> on this process  <cit> . direct cross-talks exist between efg <dig> and czf1: efg <dig> binds to the promoter of czf <dig> and repress its expression, while czf <dig> has a similar effect on the efg <dig> promoter  <cit> . more recently, czf <dig> has been shown to be required for wild type adherence to silicone devices  <cit> . despite these roles in morphogenesis, the list of czf <dig> targets has not been established to date. a partial transcriptome analysis of the czf <dig> mutant, conducted on  <dig> genes using the nanochip technology, detected very few expression changes in this mutant  <cit> .

our data strongly suggest that czf <dig> plays a role in the acquisition of multidrug resistance of the cdr type. first, czf <dig> is overexpressed in all cdr mutants that we tested. noteworthy, some other actors of white/opaque switch and hyphal growth were also overexpressed in the gu <dig> strain, including sch <dig>  adaec, wh <dig> or sfl <dig>  second, the czf <dig> null mutant is sensitive to many unrelated drugs, including azoles and molecules targeting the calcineurin pathway. remarkably, czf <dig> does not seem to be involved in drug resistance phenotypes of the mdr kind, since its expression was unchanged in mdr mutant strains. the drug sensitivity associated with the inactivation of czf <dig> does not seem to be due to standard drug resistance pathways, since the level of expression of the main actors of the cdr, mdr and calcineurin pathways were unchanged in this mutant. however, the fact that czf <dig> does not control the steady-state expression levels of those genes does not mean that it is not involved in their induction following drug exposure. this hypothesis will be tested by inactivating czf <dig> in the gu <dig> and gu <dig> backgrounds and testing the effect of this inactivation on drug resistance and gene expression.

surprisingly, we observed that the czf <dig> mutant was resistant to congo red, a cell wall perturbation agent which targets beta-glucans, the most abundant component of candida albicans cell wall. this phenotype was haploinsufficient, since the heterozygous mutant exhibited an intermediate resistance between the null mutant and the wild type. congo red is thought to target the glucan architecture by directly interacting with glucan chains, therefore inhibiting synthesis of glucan polymers  <cit> . we observed that the gsl <dig> gene encoding one of the three beta  <dig>  glucan synthase subunits, was strongly overexpressed in the czf <dig> mutant. this suggests that czf <dig> has a negative effect on the expression of some of the actors of the glucan synthesis pathway, which could explain the congo red resistance observed in the null mutant. many functional connections have been established between cell wall components and hyphal growth. gsl <dig> itself has been shown to be down-regulated during filamentation  <cit> , a process that is positively regulated by czf <dig>  notably, efg <dig> is also involved in cell wall architecture and efg <dig> mutants show a haploinsufficiency phenotype  <cit> . the deletion of one or two copies of efg <dig> leads to a decrease in the expression of many enzymes involved in cell wall biogenesis, including beta1- <dig> glucan synthases. this causes important changes in cell wall thickness and composition  <cit> . again, czf <dig> and efg <dig> seem to antagonize each other in the regulation of cell wall maintenance. the over-expression of some cell wall protein encoding genes has been extensively described as a compensatory mechanism in response to impairments in cell wall biosynthesis or to cell wall damages, both in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans . this phenomenon is largely controlled by the cell wall integrity  pathway  <cit>  but part of it is independent of cwi  <cit> . for instance, treatment with caspofungin  triggers a compensatory process which leads to the overexpression of gsl <dig>  similarly to what was observed in the czf <dig> null mutant  <cit> . we suggest that czf <dig> could play a role in this process.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results led us to propose two new roles for czf <dig> in drug resistance and cell wall maintenance . the connection between these two roles is unclear. several cell wall proteins are induced in cdr strains  . however, some cdr strains have cell wall defects, while others  seem to have normal cell wall architectures . as mentioned above, gsc <dig>  is the main target of antifungals of the echinocandin family  and mutations in gsc <dig> confer resistance to these drugs  <cit> . however, neither gsl <dig> nor gsc <dig> show any significant changes in the cdr strains and the gsl <dig> overexpression in the czf <dig> null mutant does not explain the large spectrum of drug sensitivity observed for this strain. the systematic determination of the czf <dig> targets by transcriptomic analyses of the czf <dig> mutant and chromatine immunoprecipitation will certainly thrfow some light on its role in these two processes.
