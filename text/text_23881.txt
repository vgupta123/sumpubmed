BACKGROUND
the woody bamboo classified in the grass family poaceae, bambusoideae, tribe bambusease, was considered as one of the most important non-timber forest resources in the world. in the recent years, the woody bamboo had received much attention in the ecological and economic aspects, since it has diverse advantages, such as fast-growth, high strength-to-weight ratio, strongly lignified culms, and strongly carbon fixation capability. the woody bamboo is one of the best agents for carbon sequestration in the subtropical areas of china, which is  <dig> to  <dig> times more effective than chinese fir and pines  <cit> . photosynthesis plays essential roles in supplying carbon-hydrates for the exhibition of bamboo characteristics. however, the study on spectroscopic features, capacity of forming homotrimers and structural stabilities of different bamboo isoforms  showed that they possess similar characteristics as those in other higher plants in spite of small differences  <cit> , which means that bamboo may have a special mechanism in the processes of light utilization and regulation for its fast growth though it is unknown.

the comprehensive gene expression profiles of bamboo involved in photosynthesis are significant to understand the molecular basis and dynamic gene expression in response to high light. as one of essential next-generation sequencing technology, the high-throughput rna sequencing  is capable to reveal a snapshot of rna presence and quantity from a genome at a given moment in time  <cit> . relying on the accomplishment of the draft genome sequence of moso bamboo  <cit> , rna-seq data will help reasonably interpret the functional elements of the genome and reveal the molecular composition under light stress. previous studies of expression profiles mainly focused on different tissues . to date, the genome-wide expression profile of photosynthesis-related genes in response to high light still remains elusive.

to provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular and regulated mechanism in response to high light, the chinese endemic bamboo species, moso bamboo  was focused in further analysis. based on the analysis of photosynthetic physiology, three samples including leaves treated with high light  for 0 h ,  <dig>  h  and 8 h  were used for rna isolation, respectively. we identified a large number of expressed genes in deeply sequencing pool based on rna-seq data from the three samples using the illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing platform. the further analysis of gene clustering, gene expression patterns, differentially expressed genes and transcript factors was conducted, the results facilitated our understanding of the photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species , and non-photochemical quenching  in response to high light. this maybe provide a resource of expression profiles for further experimental design as well as serve as a foundation for further studies on function of genes and regulated network under light stress, particularly the transcript factors involved in response to high light.

RESULTS
photosynthetic physiology analysis of bamboo
the chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics technique is referred to as a quick and nonintrusive probe in the studies of plant photosynthetic function. among the fluorescence parameters, npq kinetics is frequently used as a tool to characterize the non-photochemical quenching processes, and the maximal photochemical efficiency  is an index to estimate the degree of photoinhibition  <cit> . therefore, npq kinetics and fv/fm were investigated in moso bamboo leaves under high light  for up to 12 h, respectively. thus, the results in fig.  <dig> depicted the distribution of fv/fm and npq in moso bamboo leaves based on treatments of the same light intensity at different time. the maximal fv/fm appeared in 0 h, then it decreased almost linearly with the increased time under high light. the value of fv/fm at 12 h was decreased by ~  <dig>  % compared to the control . these indicated that photoinhibition under high light was targeted in moso bamboo leaves, and the degree had constantly enhanced with the increased time of high light. similarly, npq was activated by high light and increased rapidly during the first  <dig>  h, and then decreased slowly, finally tended to be stable after 8 h. taken together, we selected three representative samples, including 0 h ,  <dig>  h  and 8 h , to further perform a series of transcriptomic analysis.fig.  <dig> distribution of npq kinetics and f

overview of the bamboo transcriptome and validation of rna-seq data by qrt-pcr
in view of natural daily stress of high light less than 8 hours, three rna libraries of moso bamboo leaves were selected on the basis of photosynthetic physiological experiments. these libraries were constructed and then pair-end sequenced based on illumina highseq- <dig> in order to help comprehensively understand a global atlas of the transcriptome in response to high light. after preprocessing and quality control for raw data of rna-seq, the clean reads were aligned to the reference genome sequence from bamboo genome database  <cit>   to estimate the profile of expressed genes in each library. the software of tophat was employed and core parameters were set based on transcriptome feature and genomic architecture. as shown in additional file  <dig>  about  <dig> million reads  high quality reads, with an average of  <dig> million reads  per sample, were finally acquired as all clean reads. approximately  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of total reads were considered as unique reads and multi-position reads, which represented the number of reads mapped to the reference genome with unique position and multi-position, respectively. because multi-position reads will eventually map into one position of reference genome randomly based the complexity of reference genome as well as the limitation of sequencing and alignment methods, it inevitably has some biases in the analysis of gene expression level. the result of more unique reads and less multi-position reads in our study, therefore, will contribute to produce more reliable alignment data to facilitate the follow-up expression analysis.

to properly verify the expressed genes based on rna-seq, qrt-pcr assays were performed using independently collected samples, which were in the same developmental stage as those used for the rna-seq analysis. we selected  <dig> genes from a larger number of genes associated with photosynthesis. these contained  <dig> genes belonging to light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding  protein superfamily  and  <dig> genes of aquaporin protein family possibly involving in the regulation of stomatal numbers and sizes. based on validating a subset of rna-seq by qrt-pcr, the comparative results of fig.  <dig> demonstrated similar expression patterns between rna-seq and qrt-pcr, which proved the reliable of rna-seq data. detailed results appeared in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of relative expression of  <dig> selected genes based on rna-seq data and qrt-pcr data. a histogram of gene expression combined rna-seq data and qrt-pcr. x-axes represented  <dig> selected genes randomly. y-axes represented log <dig> . a  <dig> h vs. ck; b 8h vs. ck; c 8h vs. <dig> h. error bars indicate standard deviation in qrt-pcr data



analyzing of expressed genes in bamboo
fpkm, also known as fragments per kilobase of gene per million mapped fragments, was widely utilized in rna-seq analysis, aiming to quantify analysis of gene expression levels. to determine which genes were expressed in each sample, the statistic in the distribution of gene expression values was fulfilled among the three samples . the results revealed that all genes in the three libraries of moso bamboo shared similar distribution of gene expression . besides, the genes with fpkm >  <dig> accounted for ~90 % genes of the total annotated genes as well as the number of genes with moderate expression values  and high expression values  accounted for ~68 % of total annotated genes. however, approximately 22 % of the expressed genes were considered as low expression values .fig.  <dig> venn diagram of expressed genes with fpkm ≥  <dig> in three samples. there was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  expressed genes with fpkm ≥  <dig> in ck,  <dig> h and 8h, respectively. the number of  <dig>  expressed genes in three samples. the number of  <dig> expressed genes between  <dig> h and 8h. the number of  <dig> expressed genes between ck and  <dig> h. the number of  <dig> expressed genes between ck and 8h. the number of  <dig> expressed genes include exclusively in ck. the number of  <dig> expressed genes included exclusively in  <dig> h. the number of  <dig> expressed genes included exclusively in 8h. detailed information of expressed gene in venn diagram was attached in additional file 3




moreover, to explore the conservatively biological function for  <dig>  expressed genes in within individual sample , the enrichment analysis of gene ontology  terms was performed using all bamboo genes as the background . in total,  <dig> go terms, “biological process” , “molecular function” , and “cellular component” , were detected as significant go terms with adjusted p-value < <dig> . the results of “biological process” terms illustrated that these expressed genes were highly enriched in the processes associated with “translation ”, “organ nitrogen compound metabolic process ”, and “small molecule metabolic process ”. in the “molecular function” terms, “structural constituent of ribosome ” and “rna binding ” were mainly enriched. ultimately, some enrichment go terms in the “cellular component” involved in “cytoplasm ”, “cytoplasmic part ” and “ribonucleoprotein complex ”.

clustering affinity search reveals dynamic changes of expressed genes in three samples
the clustering affinity search technique  was broadly applied to elucidating dynamic changes in the transcriptome during different samples  <cit> . the clustering results utilized by cast in this study showed  <dig>  expressed genes in within-sample were clustered into  <dig> groups, with the gene numbers within clusters ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  five groups of expressed genes shared differentially expressed patterns according to the cluster analysis results. the same pattern contained similar trend of expressed genes, indicating that these genes maybe participate in similar or related biological process. as the biggest group, cluster  <dig> was of most interest one because a large number of genes associated with photosynthesis were detected, such as  <dig> genes of chlorophyll a/b binding protein and  <dig> genes involved in photosystem. the result indicated that the number of genes associated with photosynthesis in cluster  <dig> were more than other clusters, suggesting these genes maybe play crucial roles in response to high light.fig.  <dig> cluster analysis of expressed genes in moso bamboo. the five groups were identified via the average value of log <dig> . the number of gene in each groups was showed in bracketed. significantly go terms were depicted based on three go categories, bp: biological process, cc: cellular component, and mf: molecular function



besides, to better understand and unveil expression characteristics of clustering genes, the analysis of go terms enrichment was employed. for example, the gene expression in cluster  <dig> was decreased continuously with the increasing time of light treatment between  <dig> h and 8h. go enrichment also illustrated the terms of “photosynthesis ”, “photosystem ” and “transporter activity ” were enrichment in cluster  <dig>  on the contrary, the gene expression was increased continuously between  <dig> h and 8h with the increased light time. the mainly significant go terms, such as “protein catabolic process ”, “rna binding ”, and “ribosome ”, were enrichment in cluster  <dig>  compared with ck in the cluster  <dig>  similar expression level appeared in 8h, prior to increased expression level between  <dig> h and ck. major significant go terms in molecular function, “nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity ”, “sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor ” and “calcium ion binding ”, indicating some tfs and calcium maybe participate in this process. in addition, since a few data addressed the criteria, a few or none of significant go terms were identified in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  the lists of genes and significant go terms in each group were stored in additional file  <dig> 

analyzing of differentially expressed genes in three samples
according into the pair-wise comparison between samples,  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified utilizing the following cutoff: log2fc ≥  <dig> or ≤ − <dig>  fdr <  <dig>  . the number of  <dig> genes that differed in  <dig> h vs. ck, included  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. the number of  <dig> genes that differed in 8h vs. ck, composed of  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. ultimately, of the  <dig> genes that differed in  <dig> h vs. 8h,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated. consequently, to vividly illustrate the expression profiles in the identified  <dig>  degs, the heatmap and plot were drawn in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> summary of differentially expressed genes in  <dig> h, 8h and ck

besides, we fulfilled go enrichment analysis to investigate the functional distribution in differentially expressed genes . the results revealed some significant go terms with similar function were concentered in certain datasets. for example, go terms related to transcription factors, including “nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity ” and “sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity ”, were enriched in the dataset of dges in  <dig> h vs. ck . another example was that  <dig> significant go terms, accounting for more than 50 % of the total, were involved in photosystems and related pathways in the dataset of down-regulated dges in 8h vs. ck, such as “photosystem i ”, “photosystem ”, “thylakoid  and “photosynthesis ”.fig.  <dig> significant molecular functional terms for the up-regulated genes in  <dig> h vs. ck. the go terms were analyzed using an adjusted fdr value ≤ <dig>  as the cutoff for significant go categories. the deeper the color, the less the value of adjusted fdr



identification and analysis of the lhc protein family in bamboo
photosynthesis provides chemical energy for almost all life on earth. the primary event in photosynthesis involves the absorption of solar energy from sunlight to create electronic excitations in the peripheral antenna of photosynthetic systems and the subsequent transfer of the excitations to a reaction center  <cit> . an efficient light-harvesting step is critical for the success of photosynthesis. in addition, the lhc proteins, also known as light-harvesting antenna, are the centerpiece of eukaryotic photosynthesis and comprise of the lhc family and several families associated with phtotoprotection, such as the three-helix early light-inducible proteins , two-helix stress-enhanced proteins , one-helix light-inducible proteins , and the photosystem ii subunit s   <cit> . based on genome-wide analysis, the lhc proteins and elips in arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa were analyzed  <cit> . however, the genome-wide study of lhc proteins was still unavailable in bamboo. we identified and refined the lhc protein superfamily in moso bamboo on the basis of comparative genomic analysis and rna-seq in table  <dig> table  <dig> the genes of light-harvesting complex genes of photosystem i and ii, and light-inducible genes in bamboo

in total,  <dig> genes in moso bamboo genome were annotated as lhc and lhc-like genes, including  <dig> lhc genes and  <dig> elip genes  <cit> . here, we verified and refined  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes as lhc, lhc-like, and psbs genes in moso bamboo, respectively, based on  sequence analysis of reciprocal best gene with a. thaliana and o. sativa,  secondary structure prediction,  sequence motifs,  domain search of kegg, and  genome-wide transcriptome. for example, five genes without detailed annotation in moso bamboo genome were refined. the refined annotation of ph01002445g <dig> was “one-helix protein 1”. the updated annotation of ph01000097g <dig> and ph01000213g <dig> was “stress-enhanced protein 1”. the refined annotation of ph01003491g <dig> and ph01000280g <dig> was “stress-enhanced protein 2” and “stress-enhanced protein 3”, respectively. besides, three gene annotations, ph01000004g <dig>  ph01000293g <dig>  and ph01000845g <dig>  were updated to “non-photochemical quenching   <dig>  photosystem ii subunit” instead of initial annotation “chlorophyll a/b-binding protein”.

notably, the initial annotation of ph01001205g <dig> with “chlorophyll a/b-binding protein” maybe have problematic, not only because of the unavailable result in sequence comparative analysis of dna and protein, such as nucleotide blast in nucleotide collection of ncbi and protein domain search, but also because of the unavailable expression value in this study. in addition, the expression value of ph01001205g <dig> was also undetectable in some previous studies of moso bamboo transcriptome  <cit> . thus, we suggested that there may be a mistake in the annotation of ph01001205g <dig> initially, owing to the complexity of sequencing and assembling in moso bamboo.

there are  <dig> genes which encode for chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins in moso bamboo, higher than  <dig> genes in a. thaliana and  <dig> genes in o. sativa. similarly, there are  <dig> genes which encode for lhc-like and psbs in bamboo. those in a. thaliana and o. sativa were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. more copies of lhc genes indicated more energy may be required in the fast-growth stage of moso bamboo. the fpkm result indicated that the expression of major lhc genes was sequentially reduced with the increased light time. meanwhile, the expression values of four elip genes appeared a large rise, consistent with the previous reports that elips accumulated during early thylakoid development and light stress. in addition, the previous studies also confirmed that the primary function of lhc protein was the absorption of light through chlorophyll excitation and transfer of absorbed energy to photochemical reaction centers, while members of lhc-like and psbs families were likely involved in stress protection .

genes related to reactive oxygen species in bamboo
illumination of high light has possible trigging to overexcite the photosynthetic pigments and the electron transport chain  <cit> . when this exceeds the requirement of normal metabolism, it arises an excess of excitation energy in the photosystems. high energy states may be dissipated by npq and/or alternative processes , and may be transferred to oxygen, thus generated toxic reactive oxygen species   <cit> . to avoid damaging cellular components and even oxidative destruction of cells, ros must be detoxified by ros-scavenging pathway, which contained major enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase  and so on . based on bamboo annotation and the results of reciprocal best genes with arabidopsis and o. sativa, we found a large number of ros-scavenging enzymes in moso bamboo and their expressions were increased under high light, among which the maximum almost appeared in 8h, such as ph01000083g <dig>  ph01001010g <dig>  and ph01001942g <dig> 

besides, the results of rna-seq data also depicted the average value of gene expression in calvin cycle and photorespiratory metabolism was both declined under high light . one possible reason was that co <dig> diffusion, atp synthesis and reluctant status, high light maybe negatively affect the calvin cycle by reducing the content and activity of photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle enzymes. the limited co <dig> assimilation, thus, leaded to the decreased gene expression in photorespiratory metabolism. therefore, the levels of expressed genes in calvin cycle and photorespiratory metabolism were suppressive under high light.

ros signal transduction pathway fulfilled fundamental roles in ros signal detecting, reception and delivering in order to regulate ros-scavenging pathways. the results of dges analysis confirmed the genes in ros signal transduction pathway were up-regulated under high light. however, the plant heat stress transcription factor  in the dge dataset were more concentrated in  <dig> h than 8h. high expressed genes, such as ph01000000g <dig> and ph01000546g <dig>  were detected in  <dig> h. these indicated hsf as one of ros signals, maybe play essential roles in early stage of high light stress. in addition, the up-regulated genes annotated with hsp and hsp20/alpha crystalline family protein were detected as dges, such as ph01003771g <dig>  ph01000906g <dig>  ph01000967g <dig> and so on, indicating they maybe associate with not only heat stress, but also ros signal sensing.

moreover, ros signaling event was also associated with ca2+ and ca2+-binding proteins  <cit> , such as calmodulins. the up-regulated calmodulins were detected in  <dig> h and 8h, and those in  <dig> h were more than in 8h. besides, a ca2+ transporter, ph01000251g <dig>  was found as an up-regulated gene in  <dig> h. integrated with the previous results of redox-sensitive hsf and ca2+, their signals maybe appear in preliminary stage of high light-induced, and some of their transporters may be involved in ros signaling transduction in bamboo.

as one of significant ros sensing, serine/threonine protein kinase  was reported previously  <cit> , which played a central role in the activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase   <dig> and  <dig> associated with ca2+. in this study, the up-regulated oxi <dig> genes, such as ph01000015g <dig>  ph01000016g <dig> and ph01001215g <dig>  were found in  <dig> h and 8h, suggesting oxi <dig> maybe play a key role in ros signal transmission of bamboo under high light. as controlling the activation of different tfs associated with various defense mechanisms in response to ros stress, the mapk3/ <dig> was not enlisted in deg output, but the fpkm of mapk3/ <dig> was higher expression in  <dig> h and 8h, and the maximum mainly appeared in  <dig> h, which maybe depict mapk3/ <dig> signaling was strengthened in early stage of high light treatment. taken together, as a crucial network of ros signal transduction, including redox-sensitive hsf, ca2+, oxi <dig>  mapk3/ <dig> and some tfs, this pathway  was activated under high light and the peak signal was appeared in the initial stage. as another ros signal pathway, the phosphatases was suppressed by ros, then inhibited phosphatases promoted the expression of oxi <dig> and mapk3/ <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, mapk3/ <dig> activated many tfs participated in ros-scavenging. some down-regulated phosphatase genes concentrated in 8h, such as lipid phosphatase gene , had superfamily phosphatase gene , and phosphate transporter gene . therefore, the phosphatases in ros signal pathway maybe play a considerable role in ros signal transferring under high light treatment for a relatively long time.fig.  <dig> generalized model of reactive oxygen species  pathway in bamboo. a large amount of high light  produced an excess of excitation energy in the light reaction. some of high energy maybe transferred to oxygen, thus generated toxic ros. ros can be detected by one of mechanisms, redox sensitive transcription factors. phosphatidic acid and ca2+ activate the serine/threonine protein kinase . then, the activation of oxi <dig> activated the mitogen-activated-protein kinase  cascade  and these induced or activated short/mid-term response transcription factors that regulated the ros-scavenging and related pathways. in the ros-scavenging, main ros enzymes, reaction equation and reaction location were listed in moso bamboo. abbreviations: hl, high light; psii, photosystem ii; psi, photosystem i; chl, chlorophyll; pc, plastocyanin; cyt, cytochrome; pq, plastoquinone; 3pga, 3-phosphoglycerate; rubp, ribulose- <dig> -biphosphate; ros, reactive oxygen species; sod, superoxide dismutase; apx, ascorbate peroxidase; mdar, monodehydroascorbate reductase; gr, glutathione reductase; cat, catalase; gpx, glutathione peroxidase; aox, alternative oxidase; prxr, peroxiredoxin; trx, thioredoxins; glr, glutaredoxin; chl, chloroplast; cyt, cytosol; mem, membrane; mit, mitochondria; nuc, nuclei; per, peroxisomes



potential roles of tfs in regulating ros
to protect cells and sustain growth under high light, bamboo responded to unfavorable changes in their environments through developmental, physiological and biochemical ways. these responses required some genes expressed in response to light stress, which were regulated by a network of transcript factors   <cit> . in the ros signal networks, tfs played critical roles in response to high light stress though regulating the gene expression, by which tf was capable of binding the cis-acting elements present in the promoter of a target gene.

as previous studies indicated, many tfs maybe involve in ros signal networks under high light stress. firstly, hsf, as one of key regulators in heat shock response, will up-regulate heat shock proteins   <cit> . hsps not only can be activated and expressed during normal conditions, such as the cell growth and developments, but also can be induced by some stresses, such as heat shock, infection and heavy metals  <cit> . secondly, nac was associated with the induction of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, leading to the accumulation of anthocyanin in response to high light stress . thirdly, myb played important roles in both stomatal and non-stomatal responses by the regulation of stomatal numbers and sizes, and metabolic components, respectively, in the regulation of photosynthetic and related metabolism  <cit> . fourthly, ap2/erf was a large family of plant-specific tfs that regulated the expression of abiotic stress responsive gene. finally, wrky, as one of plant-specific tfs, contained one large family of regulatory protein in plants , which participated in various biotic stress response and several developmental and physiological processes . some wrkys in a. thaliana were significantly enhanced by h2o <dig>  which was one specific ros . these indicated wrky maybe perform an important role under oxidative stress.

therefore, combined with the previous studies and rna-seq data, the results illustrated many bamboo tfs, such as hsf, myb, bzip, ar2/erf, nac, and wrky, maybe also involve in ros signal networks under high light  and play crucial roles in regulating, acclimating, and modulating gene expression in photosynthesis process in response to high light. besides, based on the analysis of expression data and dges, the tfs of nac, wrky, ar2/erf, and bhlh might fulfill important roles in short-term , while those of c2h <dig>  hsf, bzip, and myb might perform vital roles both in short-term  and mid-term  in response to high light.table  <dig> transcript factors maybe involve in response to high light stress in moso bamboo
