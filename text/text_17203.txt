BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is a major medical problem for men around the world. according to the american cancer society, it is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men  <cit> . nearly  <dig>  men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year and it is estimated that  <dig>  will ultimately succumb to the disease. successful treatment depends upon early identification, as death rates increase significantly and treatment options decline when the tumor leaves the confines of the prostate gland  <cit> . the most significant event during prostate cancer progression is metastatic dissemination  <cit> . despite this significance, molecular events surrounding tumor progression and metastasis are poorly understood.

in recent years, our knowledge of micrornas  has evolved and it is now apparent that mirnas are an important class of non-coding rna that regulates the proteome  <cit> . mirnas are short nucleotide sequences  that alter gene expression by binding to target mrnas and either repressing translation or promoting mrna cleavage. in the presence of external cues and environmental stressors, mirnas can induce rapid changes in the proteome, allowing the cell to respond in a more precise and energy efficient manner  <cit> . numerous cellular processes are affected by mirna, including differentiation, growth/hypertrophy, cell cycle control and apoptosis  <cit> . aberrant expression of mirnas has been shown to contribute to the development of many pathological conditions including cancers of the breast, prostate, thyroid, and b-cell lymphomas  <cit> . considering their ability to modify gene expression through direct action on mrna the analysis of mirnas is an important emerging field of study in decoding the genome, its epigenetic modification, and its regulation. though mirnas have been casually observed to be associated with prostate cancer, there is no clear consensus as to which specific mirnas contribute to oncogenesis and ultimately metastasis.

many mirna genes are dysregulated in cancer and influence tumor formation/ progression because they are located in fragile regions of the genome that are commonly overexpressed, deleted or epigenetically modified  <cit> . dysregulated mirnas have been shown to contribute to oncogenesis by the loss of tumor suppressing mirnas or increased expression of oncomirs  <cit> . both loss of tumor suppressors and increase of oncomirs can ultimately result in increased cell growth, proliferation, invasiveness or metastasis. aberrant expression of even a single mirna has the potential to influence a large number of cellular processes, since it is predicted that each mirna has the potential to affect hundreds of proteins. thus, mirna dysregulation can destabilize homeostatic balance by affecting levels of a multitude of target proteins.

although it is clear that disturbance of mirna expression can influence tumorigenesis, there is little agreement on specific mirnas that contribute to the pathogenesis and metastasis of the prostate tumor. many studies have attempted to characterize a signature that can identify malignant prostate tissue from its benign counterpart but generally have failed to reveal a consistent signature capable of discriminating between phenotypes. traditional methods typically examine the most significantly, differentially expressed mirna. however, such analyses can overlook the emerging potential that mirnas can exert on downstream proteins. it is reasonable to suspect that smaller expression changes can have a greater influence toward tumorigenicity, if they regulate important protein targets. as each mirna can influence the level of numerous protein targets, even slightly dysregulated mirnas can exert a large effect on cellular behavior.

cancer is the end result of numerous alterations in biochemical pathways and networks  <cit> . understanding the molecular perturbations that underlie cancer initiation, progression and metastasis are critical. systems biologists seek to gather information about multiple types of molecules  in the cell and integrate the information in order to understand the perturbations underlying a given pathology from a broader perspective. complex interactions can be modeled as a biological network with the macromolecule represented as a node and interactions modeled as edges  <cit> . network properties are described mathematically and their contributions to homeostasis are estimated. an important indicator of molecular importance is node degree. a highly connected node is more likely to be essential and cause disease when dysregulated  <cit> . the local connectivity and position of a protein within the global network can be used to identify key proteins that are likely to cause disease when aberrantly expressed. the purpose of this paper is not to elucidate specific mirnas that drive prostate cancer development but rather outline a method for ranking differentially expressed mirnas. this work shows that expression profiling of a prostate cancer progression model in association with networks biology has the potential to reveal more relevant mirnas that drive prostate tumor progression.

RESULTS
mirnas regulate highly connected protein nodes and target pathways involved in cancer
a protein-protein interaction network  was built from proven targets of known dysregulated mirnas involved in carcinogenesis of the prostate. this network was used to determine whether or not mirnas have a tendency to regulate highly connected protein nodes. comparing the average node of proteins within a ppi network built from proteins chosen at random to a network of proteins regulated by mirnas reveals significant differences in the average node degree, closeness centrality and network stress  . this analysis shows that mirnas preferentially target highly connected protein nodes that are generally considered to be key factors within the cell  <cit> . studies have shown that proteins with a high node degree and lower closeness centrality are more likely to cause lethality when dysregulated  <cit> . the average protein in the mirna targeted network has a mean node degree of nearly  <dig>  while the randomly chosen protein network has a mean node degree of less than five . the observation that mirnas tend to preferentially regulate highly connected proteins can be used to estimate the contribution of a mirna to the overall stability within a cell. our method outlined in figure  <dig>  begins by building a data table of each mirna and associating it with proven mrna targets. each mirna/mrna interaction is paired with the ppi degree of the mrna target. this approach will be used to functionally estimate the contribution of mirna dysregulation to tumorigenic potential.
toppcluster pathway analysis of known targets of mirnas dysregulated during oncogenesis reveals an enrichment of proteins involved in pathways associated with cancer   <cit> . a similar analysis did not identify any pathway enrichment in the list of randomly chosen proteins. it is well known that driving cell cycle progression or inhibiting apoptosis can promote neoplastic transformation  <cit> . many of the mirna targets are key regulators of pathways that lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. the pathways along with key protein members are described in table  <dig> 
expression profiling of prostate cancer progression model
many model cell lines have been used to explore prostate cancer progression. most are derived from metastatic sites and thus may not represent the best model for elucidation of early indicators of cancer formation  <cit> . the cells utilized in this study were obtained from normal prostate tissue immortalized with sv <dig> large t antigen  and cycled through male athymic nude mice to obtain the highly tumorigenic and metastatic variant   <cit> . this unique, isogenic model may provide insights into the molecular causes that initiate cancer formation that may be missed in other prostate cancer cell lines established from end stage, metastasized tumors.

we discovered  <dig> mirnas that significantly change  from the parental p <dig> to the highly tumorigenic m <dig> cell line . ninety mirnas were lost as the tissue became more tumorigenic, suggesting they function as potential suppressors of tumor formation. the expression of the remaining  <dig> dysregulated mirnas showed increased expression as the tumorigenicity increased indicating they function as oncomirs. the frequency distribution of the log transformed expression is displayed in figure 4b. of the  <dig> dysregulated mirnas, only  <dig> mirnas exhibited higher expression differences  as the phenotype of the cell changed.

the cost to confirm every potentially dysregulated mirna identified in a microarray experiment is prohibitively expensive. few labs have the financial or physical resources needed to carry out such validation. therefore, labs generally choose a subset of mirnas to validate. many factors affect the choice of a gene set including relative expression differences, biological function, availability of reagents, and investigator preference. traditionally researchers have focused their efforts on extremely dysregulated mirnas. this approach may overestimate the importance of differential expression. it is reasonable to suspect that smaller changes in some mirnas may exert a greater influence in tissue behavior; i.e. if they modulate the expression of more important proteins. many of the mirnas that are altered during tumorigenesis changed between 2- <dig> fold. if one only focuses on the extremely dysregulated mirnas, the contributions of many mirnas will be overlooked. as noted in figure  <dig>  less than 20% of mirnas are dysregulated greater than 8-fold. most of the mirnas change between 2- <dig> fold; therefore, if one only focuses on the extreme expression variances, the contributions of a large number of mirnas will be overlooked. based on the observation discussed earlier using known dysregulated mirnas, our approach considers differential expression and functional relevance as ranked by the total node degree for all known protein targets. it is important to consider that not all mirna targets are known but as the field evolves our method will remain applicable. mirnas that exhibit greater than 2-fold expression differences between the non-tumorigenic and the tumorigenic, metastatic cell line were plotted against the total node degree of all proven interactions . the average connectivity of differentially expressed mirnas is ~ <dig> and indicated by a horizontal line dividing the graph into two regions. the points located near the top of the plot represent mirnas that are proven to regulate important protein nodes that may play key roles in oncogenesis. a vertical line is drawn at  <dig>  points located to the right function as oncomirs in our cells and points to the left serve as potential suppressors of tumor formation. several of these mirnas have been previously described in cancer as discussed below but their role in prostate cancer development remains unresolved. the top  <dig> dysregulated mirnas as ranked by the total node degree of proven protein targets is included in table  <dig>  since, the purpose of this paper is not to elucidate mirnas that drive prostate cancer development but rather outline a method for ranking differentially expressed mirnas further biological and biochemical analyses are needed to define their contribution to the development of prostate cancer.
potential mirnas regulating prostate tumorigenesis
our method identified five mirnas that clearly stood out from the others with total node degrees exceeding  <dig>  a review of the literature supports the fact that each of these may play a role in the tumorigenic propensity of the m <dig> cells . three mirnas  with known roles in prostate cancer were identified . of these, one mirna  is highly dysregulated during prostate cancer progression and likely would have been selected for further analyses based upon extreme differential expression. the other two  are not as greatly dysregulated and their contribution to oncogenesis may have been overlooked. potential roles in cancer development for these selected mirnas are discussed below. two mirnas  may play a role in prostate cancer progression but their mechanism is not as clearly defined and additional investigation is needed. they are identified in figure  <dig> with a square.

human mir-125b was greatly decreased in the highly tumorigenic, metastatic m <dig> cell line. there are many proven targets of mir-125b including the epidermal growth factor receptors  erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  <cit> . increased levels of erbb2/ erbb <dig> can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis through activation of the akt pathway. patients with metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer all showed an increase in egfr expression and overexpression of the egfr receptor has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes  <cit> . a recent study that compared matched prostate tumorigenic epithelium to benign epithelium revealed significant down regulation of mir-125b suggesting that the decreased expression of mir-125b can be used as a potential biomarker to discern malignant from benign epithelium. <cit> . increased expression of mir-125b in highly tumorigenic and metastatic prostate cancer cells may decrease tumorigenicity by inhibiting the egfr family of growth factor receptors also making mir-125b an attractive therapeutic target. in this cell progression model, mir-125b clearly functions as a tumor suppressor.

mir- <dig> possesses diverse roles in cell proliferation, invasion and motility  <cit> . many studies have shown that mir- <dig> functions as an oncomir. it often increases during the process of tumorigenesis targeting a large number of genes that inhibit tumorigenic transformation  <cit> . however, a recent study by folini et al. shows that many prostate cancer patients suffer a down regulation of mir- <dig>  <cit> . this suggests a need to consider any dysregulated mirna in the context of the disease as its role could change depending upon the tissue source. mir- <dig> is not the only mirna to display contrasting behaviors during cancer development. eleven mirnas have shown conflicting results during prostate tumor progression and can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncomir  <cit> . despite the conflict, mir- <dig> remains an interesting target that needs further investigation.

predominantly thought to induce cardiac/skeletal muscle differentiation and development, mir- <dig> also increases during the development of prostate cancer  <cit> . dozens of targets have been proven to be regulated by mir- <dig>  the most well described of which is hdac <dig>  a histone deacetylase. androgen insensitivity is commonly observed in most disseminated prostate carcinomas. localization of hdac <dig> in the nucleus of androgen insensitive cancer cell lines was observed and hypothesized to contribute to the development of the hormone refractive phenotype  <cit> . hdac <dig> represses transcription of the androgen receptor  <cit> . it remains probable that mir- <dig> may be an important oncomir that drives prostate cancer progression justifying further investigation.

although a role for the remaining two mirnas  is less obvious, a case can be made for their possible role in prostate tumorigenesis. studies have demonstrated that the decreased expression of mir-34a may enhance cancer progression  <cit> . wild type p <dig> has been shown to transactivate mir-34a. it is known that pc <dig> and du <dig> cells are null or express a mutant p <dig> respectively when compared to the lncap cells that express wild type p <dig>  thus mir-34a expression is dependent upon a secondary regulator. although the status of p <dig> needs to be investigated in the cell lines, it is possible that p <dig> expression could account for differences in mir-34a levels. mir- <dig> is enriched in brain tissue and its over expression in neural stem cells induces differentiation  <cit> . other studies have shown that mir- <dig> functions as a tumor suppressor and is lost during tumorigenesis  <cit> . as mentioned previously, several mirnas have shown contrasting roles and therefore conflicting roles must be considered between different types and stages of carcinoma progression. in our cell model the expression of mir- <dig> increases during tumorigenesis. although clear roles for these mirnas in prostate tumor progression could not be identified, our study would suggest their investigation is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
the method described here extends a researcher's ability to not only consider the extent of differential expression but includes consideration of functional importance when choosing which mirnas to further characterize. this work shows that mirnas preferentially target messages that are highly connected and when aberrantly expressed results in a loss of cell cycle control leading to increased proliferation, invasion and metastasis. expression profiling of a prostate cancer cell progression model revealed a large number of dysregulated mirnas, several of which have known roles in the development of cancer  but their involvement in prostate cancer progression was not clear. two new mirnas  that likely affect prostate tumor progression were identified but a literature review does not indicate a clear role, and thus continued investigation is needed to prove their role in cancer formation.
