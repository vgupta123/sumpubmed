BACKGROUND
transfer cells in plants mediate solute transport between the apoplast and the symplast. one structural feature of plant transfer cells is the extensive secondary cell wall growth, which increases the plasma membrane surface area and is thought to facilitate rapid solute transport across the plasma membrane  <cit> . in agreement with their solute exchange activity, transfer cells are typically observed in sink or source tissues in the vicinity of vascular tissues. at the base of the maize endosperm, a layer of transfer cells faces the maternal placento-chalazal zone  <cit> . seed development in maize is dependent on nutrient transfer through this cell layer, termed the basal endosperm transfer cell layer .

cysteine rich proteins  constitute a large superfamily of small, secreted proteins abundant in eukaryotes  <cit> , <cit> . crps are involved in both cell-signaling  <cit> , <cit>  and antimicrobial processes  <cit> . in plants, cell-cell communications mediated by secreted crps contribute to stomata differentiation  <cit> , to guiding pollen tube growth  <cit>  in self-incompatibility  <cit> , and patterning embryo development  <cit> . betl in the maize endosperm also secretes multiple types of crps, including basal endosperm transfer layer <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , bap <cit> , and maternally expressed gene  <dig>   <cit> . it was shown that a myb-like transcription factor that plays a key role in betl development, zmmrp- <dig>  is involved in expression of betl- <dig>  betl- <dig>  and meg <dig> <cit> – <cit> . given that the betl is at the maternal-filial interface, these crps may protect developing seeds from maternally-transmitted pathogens  <cit> . it is also possible that some betl crps serve as extracellular signal molecules that coordinate the supply of maternal nutrients during seed development  <cit> .

the meg <dig> gene is required for normal development of the betl, and elevated expression of meg <dig> increases betl sizes and seed biomass. interestingly, ectopic expression of meg <dig> drives the expression of betl-specific genes such as zmmrp- <dig> and incw <dig> in non-betl endosperm cells. because meg <dig> is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, and the effects of meg <dig> are dosage dependent, the promotion of nutrient uptake by meg <dig> provides evidence that nutrient uptake during seed development is under maternal control  <cit> , <cit> . the enhanced nutrient allocation resulting from meg <dig> over-expression suggests that the meg <dig> protein contributes to establishing the sink strength of developing seeds by controlling betl. a group of crps, termed embryo surrounding factor  <dig> , play roles similar to meg <dig> in arabidopsis. the suspensor at the base of the embryo is involved in nutrient transport in arabidopsis and esf1s produced from the central cells and endosperm cells promote suspensor development  <cit> .

homologs of meg <dig> are also transcribed in the developing endosperm  <cit> . we have shown that these meg <dig> homologs are among the most highly-expressed genes in the betl  <cit> . the existence of active meg <dig> homologs raises questions about how this family arose and whether various meg <dig> homologs play similar or different functional roles. in this study, we identify the global complement of functional and non-functional meg family genes in maize and in the closely-related sorghum outgroup; we use a combination of phylogenetic and population-genetic techniques to characterize selection pressures across these genes and link selection to changes in gene expression and protein structure. we find that the meg gene family expanded rapidly in maize, with some evidence suggesting that positive selection may have driven changes in protein structure. our analysis indicates that more recent duplicates exhibit higher expression levels, more extensive structural changes, and stronger evidence for adaptation than do older duplicates, suggesting that newer, functionally different meg homologs may have prevailed over older homologs during recent adaptation.

RESULTS
identification of meg genes in maize
the meg <dig> gene in maize is a member of the large meg/ae <dig> supergroup of crps consisting of  <dig> subgroups sharing a simple cxcc motif but little detectable sequence similarity  <cit> . we focused our attention on the subgroup crp <dig>  which includes meg <dig> and other members containing the cysteine motif: cxcxcyccxcxc and exhibiting conserved amino acid sequence. based on sequence conservation, we identified  <dig> loci in the b <dig> maize genome homologous to meg <dig>  including meg <dig>  meg <dig>  meg <dig>  and meg <dig> that have been identified previously together with meg <dig> <cit> . the b <dig> genome does not contain any open reading frame that matches meg <dig>  we named  <dig> new members meg7—meg <dig> according to their chromosome position. the seven loci upstream of meg <dig> were named meg7—meg <dig> from proximal to distal to the meg <dig> gene, and the locus downstream of meg <dig> was named meg <dig> .

the meg <dig> gene consists of two coding exons separated by a single intron and an upstream promoter required for specific expression in basal endosperm transfer cells   <cit> . we found that the complete meg <dig> gene architecture is shared by  <dig> meg homologs . exceptions were meg <dig>  meg <dig>  meg <dig>  meg <dig> and meg <dig>  meg <dig> has the two canonical exons but its promoter is distinct from that of meg <dig>  the first coding exon is missing from meg <dig> and meg <dig>  meg <dig> does not appear to have promoter elements, suggesting that it may not be transcribed. the flanking sequences of meg <dig> and meg <dig> suggest that disruption of the two genes has been caused by non-homologous end joining. meg <dig> has the two coding exons, but its promoter is dislocated ~ <dig>  kb upstream from the first exon by a transposon insertion. the structure of meg <dig> is abnormal in that it has multiple regulatory elements and extra exons that are disarranged.

clustering of maize meg genes
all  <dig> meg loci reside on maize chromosome 7s, between the molecular markers p-asg <dig> and p-asg <dig>  when compared with chromosome regions where gene density is high or where local gene duplicates are concentrated, this meg region exhibits several distinct features. first, rather than tightly clustering in a genic island like other maize gene clusters  <cit> , the thirteen loci of the meg family are spread over a genomic region of ~800 kb . also gene density is lower in the meg region than in other genic regions of the maize genome; the average distance between neighboring meg genes is 62 kb, larger than the average interval between similar locally-duplicated genes such as p <dig>  rp <dig>  zein, kn <dig>  pl <dig>  a1-b, or rp <dig> . the density of genes in the meg cluster is even lower than the average gene density of the entire maize genome . the overly-dispersed nature of the meg gene cluster is striking, considering the general tendency of maize genes to concentrate in tightly-integrated gene islands  <cit> .

approximately 85% of the maize genome consists of transposable elements, with gypsy transposons tending to predominate in gene-poor heterochromatic regions  <cit>  and mutator transposons tending to predominate in genic regions and in open chromatin  <cit> . in contrast this general pattern across the maize genome, gypsy transposons comprise 75% lengthwise of all transposable elements in the 800-kb meg region, and mutator transposons are completely absent from this region .

chromosomal recombination tends to occur often in euchromatin but is suppressed in heterochromatin  <cit> . consistent with the presence of the gypsy heterochromatic-marker transposons and highly-dispersed genes, the  <dig> -mb genomic region containing the meg cluster  shows a low recombination rate of <  <dig> centimorgan  . the  <dig> -mb region upstream  and the  <dig> -mb region downstream  flanking the low-recombining meg region represent ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  cm of genetic distance, respectively, suggesting that the region surrounding the meg gene cluster represents a localized region of reduced recombination. taken together, these data suggest that the meg gene region displays characteristics of maize non-pericentromeric heterochromatin.

we found that all members of the meg cluster, except meg <dig> and meg <dig>  are surrounded by homologous 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences . the lengths of the homologous flanking sequences vary from a few hundred base pairs to more than 5 kb. the 5' flanking sequences of nine genes  contain xilon-digus retrotransposons, which vary in length. in contrast, meg <dig> and meg <dig> have prem <dig> retrotransposon insertions at the beginning of their 5' flanking sequences. the 3' flanking sequences of all meg genes, except meg <dig>  are homologous. meg <dig> is peculiar in that the flanking sequences on both sides are not homologous to any of the other  <dig> meg genes, suggesting that it may have a unique origin. the general homology of the sequences surrounding the meg genes suggests that expansion of the meg family can be primarily attributed to unequal crossover and insertion of transposable elements that left characteristic signatures up- and down-stream of duplicate genes.

evolutionary history of meg genes
the meg gene cluster resides exclusively on chromosome 7s in maize. we searched the public databases to identify homologs of meg genes in other grass species. two open reading frames in sorghum  displayed strong sequence similarity with meg <dig> and other members of the maize meg gene cluster, and one gene in foxtail millet  was identified as a potential homolog. we found no homologs in rice or other closely-related species, suggesting that meg genes originated before the sorghum/maize split but after the panicoideae group diverged from other grass species . although meg1-related peptides of arabidopsis, esf1s, have been identified and functionally characterized  <cit> , there is no detectable sequence similarity between esf1s and the genes identified in maize and other grass species, asides from their conserved patterns of cysteine residues. short secreted peptides such as meg typically evolve very rapidly, making the determination of precise phylogenetic relationships across large timescales difficult. we therefore restricted our analyses to those meg homologs displaying reliable sequence similarity, although the actual evolutionary origin of this gene family is likely to have been much earlier.

using sequence similarity to meg genes and to other genes flanking the maize meg cluster, we identified regions in the maize, sorghum, and rice genomes that are homologous or homeologous to the 800-kb meg-containing region. the maize meg genes and their sorghum homologs reside exclusively in a syntenic block conserved throughout grass genomes . gene colinearity is well-retained in the syntenic blocks of maize, sorghum and rice, although the 4-mb region of maize chromosome 7s containing the meg genes is five times larger than the corresponding region in rice, which lacks meg homologs. the complete lack of meg genes in the homeologous region of maize chromosome  <dig> suggests that the duplication events in the meg family happened only in chromosome  <dig>  primarily after allotetraploidization ~ <dig>  million years ago   <cit> , <cit> , while the meg copies in chromosome  <dig> were lost.

in order to confirm that the expansion of the meg gene family is not an anomaly of the b <dig> inbred line, we estimated copy numbers in six additional maize cultivars. all meg loci were amplified from each cultivar, and amplicons were sequenced to determine whether the specific polymorphisms in each meg gene were present in the amplicons . with few exceptions, all six inbred lines share the complete complement of meg genes, suggesting that meg gene family expansion probably occurred before the establishment of modern maize cultivars. further supporting this hypothesis, we were able to confirm all the meg homologs from teosinte , suggesting that the meg gene cluster had fully expanded before maize was domesticated from its wild ancestor, ca. 4000– <dig>  years ago .

we reconstructed the phylogeny of meg family genes using maximum likelihood, with the distantly-related foxtail millet meg gene used as an outgroup. the resulting phylogeny identified a large clade consisting of the  <dig> b <dig> meg genes and one of the sorghum meg homologs , separated from meg <dig> and the other sorghum homolog  with strong statistical support . maize meg <dig> and sorghum sbmeg <dig> share homologous downstream flanking sequences and a nearby putative thioredoxin h gene , further supporting their grouping. together, these data suggest that maize meg14/sbmeg <dig> may have diverged from the maize meg1-13/sbmeg <dig> clade after the maize/sorghum group split from millet but prior to the maize/sorghum divergence.

in addition to outgroup rooting using the foxtail millet meg sequence, we used gene-tree/species-tree reconciliation to estimate the rooted phylogeny by minimizing gene gain/loss events  <cit> . the most parsimonious rooting  supports the view that two meg genes were present in the common ancestor of maize and sorghum. one of these ancestral genes was retained as a single copy in both species , while the other ancestor underwent a series of at least two rapid expansions in the maize genome. maize meg <dig> falls at the base of the maize-specific expansion and is separated from the other meg homologs with strong support. meg <dig> is also located downstream from the other maize-specific meg genes , suggesting that the meg <dig> gene was probably the original progenitor of the maize expansion that would have occurred through a series of “upstream” duplication events. the consistency between phylogenetic “age” and chromosome position supports this general model, with genes closer in physical location to meg <dig> tending to fall toward the base of the meg phylogeny .

to date the time of meg gene duplications, we reconstructed the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using a molecular clock calibrated with a maize-sorghum divergence time of ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> . consistent with the absence of meg genes on maize chromosome  <dig>  molecular-clock analysis suggested that meg gene expansions occurred after maize allotetraploidization . according to this analysis, the majority of meg genes  appeared very recently through a rapid series of duplication events that cannot be resolved phylogenetically . meg <dig> was inferred to have arisen ~ <dig> — <dig>  mya, and the oldest duplicates following the maize-sorghum split, meg <dig> and meg <dig>  arose ~ <dig> — <dig>  mya, right after maize allotetraploidization. although we are cautious in our assignment of concrete dates to these duplication events, as molecular-clock assumptions are likely to be violated, these results suggest a model in which the meg gene cluster expanded rapidly in maize after allotetraploidzation  but before domestication . these results are corroborated by examination of synteny and phylogenetic analyses , which do not rely on molecular-clock assumptions.

evidence for positive selection driving changes in meg protein secondary structure
functional divergence of cysteine rich proteins  has often been linked to gene duplication followed by positive selection acting to alter protein function  <cit> – <cit> . we used statistical analyses based on examining the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in order to characterize the possible role of adaptive processes in shaping the protein functions of maize meg homologs. these analyses identified a single branch on the phylogeny as exhibiting strong evidence for protein-coding adaptation, the branch uniting meg3- <dig>  which represents the most recent maize-specific expansion event .

branch-sites analysis further identified two amino-acid substitutions on the meg3- <dig> branch that appear to have been driven by positive selection . these substitutions replace a conserved ak motif next to the first conserved cysteine with a vv motif, altering the size, charge and hydrophobicity of this region. an additional unusual arg to trp substitution in meg <dig> in front of the same cysteine residue suggests that this position may represent a “hotspot” of meg protein functional differentiation.

although crystal structures to support homology modeling of meg proteins are not available, we characterized secondary structures of meg proteins to identify possible structural consequences of amino-acid substitutions. we found that there was a general reduction in the proportion of α-helices and a corresponding increase in β-strands during the maize-specific meg family expansion . for example, the oldest meg proteins, meg <dig> and meg <dig>  were predicted to contain  <dig> % and  <dig> % α-helices, respectively. in contrast, the youngest proteins, meg <dig>  meg <dig> and meg <dig>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % alpha-helix, respectively . the alpha-helix content of the evolutionary intermediates, meg <dig> and meg <dig>  fell between those of the oldest and youngest genes . proportions of β-strand displayed the opposite trend, with β-strand proportion increasing from oldest to youngest .

we are cautious in our interpretation of secondary-structure predictions, as modern methods only achieve ~80% accuracy . however, it is interesting to note that localized changes in predicted protein secondary structure correlate strongly with the specific amino acids identified as being under positive selection . this protein region forms the first α-helix of the mature peptide in meg <dig> and meg <dig>  the region surrounding the adaptive changes is predicted as disordered in the intermediate-aged meg <dig> and meg <dig>  leading to an overall reduction in the length of this first α-helix. in the more recently derived meg <dig>  meg <dig>  and meg <dig>  the first α-helix is predicted as completely missing and is replaced by a conserved β-strand . overall, these results suggest that the n-terminal region of maize meg proteins has undergone a systematic and directional structural reorganization throughout the expansion of the meg gene family. although the absence of 3d structural data and the low accuracy of secondary structure prediction limit our ability to draw strong conclusions about how changes in meg protein sequence may have changed protein function, the confluence of adaptive protein-coding changes and alteration of predicted secondary structures do suggest that these evolutionary changes have altered meg protein function in some way.

evidence for recent selective sweeps in the maize meg gene cluster
to investigate the possible role of recent selective sweeps in maize meg gene evolution, we analyzed maize polymorphism data  <cit> , <cit>  using a composite-likelihood method to identify population-level adaptation  <cit> . we found that the meg region had the strongest signature of an adaptive sweep across the entire distal 30 mb of maize chromosome 7s . although we are cautious about the ability of these methods to identify the precise locations of selective sweeps across the genome  <cit> , we note that the strongest support for population-level adaptation localized to meg9— <dig> and just upstream of meg <dig> and meg <dig> . the functional consequences of these putative adaptive sweeps remain unknown, although these results do suggest that the maize meg gene cluster may have experienced recent positive selection, further supporting a general model of maize adaptation through meg gene family expansion and diversification.

it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions about adaptive changes in protein function from phylogenetic and population-genetic analyses, alone so we consider these conclusions speculative at this point. however, we note that the combination of statistical evidence for elevated nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios, nonconservative amino-acid substitutions, localized changes in predicted secondary structure, and population-genetic evidence for possible selective sweeps all argue in favor of a model in which adaptation has played a role in the maize meg gene expansion.

expression profiles of meg genes
to determine transcription profiles of meg genes in the endosperm, we measured mrna levels from basal endosperm transfer cells , starchy endosperm cells  and peripheral endosperm  containing aleurone cells at three developmental stages . we found that the transcript levels of six meg genes  are significantly higher than those of other meg genes  . these genes are all highly expressed specifically in betcs at  <dig>   <dig> and 16 days after pollination  , with the three consecutive meg genes, meg <dig>  meg <dig> and meg <dig> being the most highly transcribed . in contrast to these highly-expressed meg homologs, five meg genes showed negligible transcription levels across all cell types and time points , and the two remaining meg genes had intermediate levels of transcription, specifically in betcs .

these differences in the transcript levels of meg genes correlate well with preservation of gene integrity in the meg genes. the promoter and/or the two canonical exons are disrupted in the five meg genes with low fpkm values . meg <dig> and meg <dig> exhibit intermediate transcript levels and appear to have the canonical meg gene structure. however, meg <dig> has a 22 bp deletion in its promoter, and meg <dig> contains a frame shift mutation, which may affect the stability of its transcript. meg <dig> has been annotated as a pseudogene .

despite the large variation in transcript levels, all meg genes displayed similar spatiotemporal expression patterns. their transcripts were strictly confined to betcs, and transcription levels were highest at  <dig> dap, but decreased thereafter . these results suggest that the expansion of the meg gene family in maize does not include diversification of expression patterns but does include variation in expression level across homologs, with more recently-derived intact genes generally having higher expression levels.

to further examine expression of meg genes at the protein level, we searched the atlas of maize proteotypes database , where results from proteomic analyses of maize seed tissues are cataloged. peptides were identified from six meg genes, corresponding to the six genes with the highest transcript concentrations in the endosperm . peptides from the other  <dig> meg genes were absent from the database. furthermore, the protein abundance of highly-expressed meg genes peaked at 8– <dig> dap and reduced thereafter, in agreement with their transcript levels.

because meg <dig> is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, we examined imprinting status of other meg genes from publicly available transcriptome datasets generated by reciprocal crosses of b73xmo <dig>  <cit> – <cit> . meg <dig> expression is maternally imprinted at  <dig> dap but it becomes biallelic at  <dig> dap  <cit> . the transcriptome datasets were generated from endosperm samples at  <dig> dap and  <dig> dap, before meg1’s imprinted expression disappears. first, we compared coding sequences of all meg genes to determine their single nucleotide polymorphisms  in b <dig> and in mo <dig> inbred lines. we were able to identify snps in  <dig> meg alleles of b <dig> and mo <dig>  and maternal to paternal expression ratios of the  <dig> genes were available in the dataset by xin et al. <cit> . unlike meg <dig>  none of the  <dig> genes exhibited parent-of-origin specific expression. instead, mo <dig> alleles of meg <dig>  meg <dig>  and meg <dig> displayed strong dominance over those of b <dig> while b <dig> alleles of meg <dig>  meg <dig>  and meg <dig> overwhelmed those of mo <dig> . meg <dig> and meg <dig> did not exhibit allele specific expression patterns. no snps were identified in b <dig> and mo <dig> alleles of meg <dig>  meg <dig>  meg <dig> and meg <dig> and we were not able to find information about their parent of origin specific expression in the datasets. expression data of meg <dig>  meg <dig>  and meg <dig> were available from waters et al. <cit>  and they were consistent with the results in figure 6a. these suggest that parent-of-origin specific expression of meg <dig> is not conserved in the  <dig> meg duplicates that we examined in the b73xmo <dig> expression datasets.

the meg gene region comprises  <dig> annotations in the b <dig> genome database , including the  <dig> meg genes. among the  <dig> other annotations,  <dig> are transposable elements,  <dig> are pseudogenes or devoid of coding sequences, and  <dig> are predicted to be protein-coding genes with intact open reading frames. to determine whether the  <dig> putative protein-coding genes are transcriptionally active in the endosperm, we searched our endosperm transcriptome data using the blast program. transcripts from three genes  were identified as transcribed in endosperm, but their levels ranged from 5% to 20% of the meg <dig> transcript . grmzm2g <dig> is expressed in all three cell-types, while grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> are expressed specifically in betcs. the high levels of meg transcripts in betcs suggest that the meg region corresponds to a transcriptional “hotspot” in betcs, even though the region exhibits features of pericentromeric heterochromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
the meg gene family has expanded radically in maize since its divergence from sorghum. however, the functional consequences of this expansion remain unclear. meg proteins are members of the crp superfamily, other members of which play diverse roles in cell signaling and defense in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . most maize meg genes are expressed exclusively in the betl, and it is evident that meg <dig> is involved in the control of nutrient transport by promoting betl formation  <cit> . both sorghum and maize have betls  <cit> , <cit> , but meg genes have expanded only in maize. this suggests that the cell-signaling networks controlling seed development and nutrient allocation through the betl may have diversified in maize. alternatively, meg gene-family expansion could function to alter the molecular mechanisms responsible for isolating the developing seed from infections in the maternal tissue in maize. the loss of imprinting in meg genes is in line with the notion that functional diversity in the meg family expanded along its evolution. further examination of the functional roles played by meg family genes is likely to enhance our understanding of how tandem gene duplication events contribute to species-specific adaptation in plants.

in this study, we examined the evolution of recently-duplicated genes to identify molecular selection by the combined use of phylogenetic and population-genetic analyses and to identify functional differences between duplicates by characterizing their expression, localization, imprinting, and protein structures. we observed changes in coding exons and promoter sequences throughout the meg gene array in maize, consistent with a model in which mistakes introduced during the production of tandemly-duplicated gene arrays may be an important source of differences in both gene expression and protein function. we expect that a thorough understanding of gene duplication processes will illuminate the potential roles of “imperfect” gene duplication in generating the molecular diversity necessary to drive evolution and adaptation.
