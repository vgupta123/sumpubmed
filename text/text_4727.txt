BACKGROUND
sesamum indicum l. , a diploid species , is one of the most ancient oil seed crops  <cit> . about  <dig> million tons of sesame seeds are produced each year worldwide . sesame seeds are an important source of high-quality oil containing natural antioxidants such as sesamin and sesamol. despite its economic importance and nutritional value, the genetic and molecular biology study of sesame began only recently. just one genetic map has been published for sesame  <cit>  and quantitative trail loci  mapping has not been reported.

a genetic map, especially a high-density genetic map, provides an important foundation for qtl mapping  <cit>  and for anchoring sequence scaffolds  <cit> . large-scale microsatellite marker development is an important approach to obtain sufficient numbers of markers to construct a high-density genetic map. this approach was used for tobacco   <cit>  and japanese flounder   <cit> , constructing high-density genetic map with an average interval of less than  <dig>  cm between markers, and the developed ssr markers will also be important tools to further advance genome analysis. another approach to construct a high-density genetic map is to utilize several types of available markers in a single study. troggio et al.  <cit>  published a dense genetic linkage map for grapevine that was constructed using  <dig> single-nucleotide polymorphism -based genetic markers,  <dig> simple sequence repeats , and  <dig> amplified fragment length polymorphisms . the snp-based markers were developed from bac-end sequence resources, and their inclusion significantly increased the density of the map. wang et al.  <cit>  constructed a high-density genetic linkage map for cabbage with  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> snps that spanned a total of  <dig> .9 cm with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci. in this case, the snp markers were developed by resequencing the other parent of a mapping population.

snps are more useful as genetic markers than many conventional markers because they are the most abundant and stabile form of genetic variation in most genomes  <cit> . sequence polymorphisms introduced by snps are easy to compile in a database and are useful for evolutionary studies  <cit> . high-throughput methods for snp identification and genotyping have been rapidly developed to exploit these advantages. miller et al.  <cit>  developed a rapid and cost-effective polymorphism identification and genotyping approach using restriction site-associated dna  markers. this approach was used for rapid snp discovery and genetic linkage mapping in many organisms including stickleback, neurospora crassa, plutella xylostella, barley, and grape  <cit> . peterson et al.  <cit>  reported a modified low-cost rad sequencing  approach called double digest radseq as a complete laboratory protocol requiring no prior genomic knowledge. poland et al.  <cit>  also developed a novel two-enzyme genotyping-by-sequencing  approach and used it to construct high-density genetic maps for barley and wheat. the use of two enzymes differed from the original gbs protocol in that amplified fragments in the two-enzyme libraries all consisted of the barcoded forward adapter and the common reverse adapter. this method of library construction greatly simplified the quantification of the library prior to sequencing. recently, sun et al.  <cit>  reported the development of specific length amplified fragment sequencing  as a high-resolution strategy for large-scale de novo snp discovery and genotyping. the efficiency of this approach was tested on data from rice and soybean and used to create a genetic map for common carp , which was the highest-density genetic map yet for any organism without the benefit of a reference genome sequence.

since  <dig>  several kinds of markers have been used to assess the genetic diversity of sesame accessions including random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeat   <cit> , aflp  <cit> , sequence-related amplified polymorphism   <cit> , and random selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci   <cit> , but no ssr markers were available for sesame until  <dig>  dixit et al.  <cit>  developed the first series of ssr markers for sesame and more than  <dig> ssr markers have been developed and published to date  <cit> . despite the demonstrated importance of ssr markers for constructing genetic maps in many crops, the quantity of available sesame ssr markers was not sufficient to meet the requirements of genetic map construction due to the low polymorphism rate in these markers. wei et al.  <cit>  constructed the first genetic map for sesame using  <dig> est-ssrs,  <dig> aflps, and  <dig>  rsampls, but only  <dig> of these markers  were mapped in  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig>  cm with an average marker spacing of  <dig>  cm. wei et al.  <cit>  pointed out the need for additional markers to obtain an accurate length of the sesame genome and high-density map coverage. subsequently, zhang et al.  <cit>  integrated  <dig> genic ssrs into  <dig> main linkage groups on this map. but a high-density genetic map for sesame has not been published yet due to a lack of sufficient molecular markers.

in this study, we employed the recently developed slaf-seq approach to achieve the first rapid mass discovery of snp and insertion-deletion  markers for sesame. using these newly developed markers, a high-density genetic map was constructed and its characteristics were investigated, the method used in this study for developing markers and future applications for this genetic map were also discussed.

RESULTS
analysis of slaf-seq data and slaf markers
after slaf library construction and high-throughput sequencing,  <dig>  gb of data containing  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads was obtained with each read being ~70 bp in length. the q <dig>  ratio was  <dig> % and guanine-cytosine  content was  <dig> %. of these high-quality data, ~158 mb were from the male parent with  <dig> , <dig> reads and ~157 mb were from the female parent with  <dig> , <dig> reads. read numbers for the  <dig> individuals in the f <dig> population ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> with an average of  <dig> , <dig> 

the numbers of slafs in the male and female parents were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the read numbers for slafs were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> in the male and female parents, respectively. the average coverage for each marker was  <dig> -fold in the male parent and  <dig> -fold in the female parent. in the f <dig> population, the numbers of slaf markers in each individual ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the read numbers for slafs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> with an average of  <dig> , and the coverage ranged from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold with an average of  <dig> -fold .

among the  <dig>  high-quality slafs that were detected,  <dig>  were polymorphic with a polymorphism rate of only  <dig> % . of the  <dig>  polymorphic slafs,  <dig>  were classified into eight segregation patterns . an f <dig> population is obtained by selfing the f <dig> of a cross between two fully homozygous parents with genotype aa or bb. therefore, only the aa × bb segregation pattern in the f <dig> population was used to construct a genetic map, and  <dig>  markers fell into this class. among these  <dig>  markers,  <dig>  markers had more than 20-fold of parental sequence depth, and more than 14-fold of individual sequence depth, and over 80% integrity of slaf tags, and these were used for the genetic map construction.

basic characteristics of the genetic map
after linkage analysis,  <dig>   of the  <dig>   markers were mapped onto the genetic map, while other  <dig> markers were failed to be linked to any group. coverage of these markers was  <dig> -fold in the male parent,  <dig> -fold in the female parent, and  <dig> -fold in each f <dig> individual on average. the integrity of each marker among the 107 f <dig> individuals was also a key parameter for controlling map quality. all of the markers on the map had 98% integrity on average.

the final map included  <dig>  markers on the  <dig> linkage groups  and was  <dig> .87 cm in length with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. to our knowledge, this map is the densest genetic linkage map to date for sesame. as shown in table  <dig>  the largest linkage group  was lg <dig> with  <dig> markers, a length of  <dig>  cm, and an average distance of only  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the smallest lg was lg <dig>  with only  <dig> markers, a length of  <dig>  cm, and an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the degree of linkage between markers was reflected by 'gap < = 5’ ranging between  <dig> % and  <dig> % with an average value of  <dig> %. the largest gap on this map was  <dig>  cm located in lg <dig> 

'gap < =5’ indicated the percentages of gaps in which the distance between adjacent markers was smaller than 5 cm.

distribution of markers types on the genetic map
the genetic map had three types of markers including  <dig> 'snp_only’ ,  <dig> 'indel_only’ , and  <dig> 'snp&indel’ markers. 'snp_only’ was the predominant marker type accounting for  <dig> % of the markers. marker types in each of the  <dig> lgs were investigated . lg <dig>  the smallest lg, had the lowest percentage of 'snp_only’ markers but had the highest percentage of 'indel_only’ markers at 60% and 20%, respectively. lg <dig> had the highest percentage of 'snp&indel’ markers with  <dig> %. the percentages of the three types of markers on the largest lg, lg <dig>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, which was very similar to the average distribution of marker types for all  <dig> lgs.

among the  <dig>  markers of the 'snp_only’ type,  <dig> had two, or more than two, snp loci, but the other  <dig> markers had a single snp locus and accounted for 72% of the total. in total,  <dig>  snp loci were detected among the  <dig>  markers on the final map and percentages of different snp types were investigated . most of the snps were transition type snps with y and r types accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of all snp markers. the other four snp types were transversions including s, m, k, and w with percentages ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and accounting for  <dig> % of all snps.

segregation distortion markers on the map
in total,  <dig> markers that showed significant  segregation distortion were mapped onto the final map  and were distributed mostly on the ends of lgs with linkage. the results of a χ <dig> test showed that segregation distortion markers were distributed on every lg with a distribution very similar to that of all markers  except for lg <dig> and lg <dig>  this means that one lg had a greater number of markers and segregation distortion markers at the same time. for example, the largest lg  had the highest percentage of segregation distortion markers  and the smallest lg  had the lowest percentage of segregation distortion markers . however, the frequency of segregation distortion markers on lg <dig> and lg <dig> was much higher than for other lgs at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. while  <dig> segregation distortion regions were detected on  <dig> lgs, lg <dig> and lg <dig> both had the largest number of segregation distortion regions.

χ <dig> and p indicate χ <dig> values with one degree of freedom and the corresponding probability, respectively.

sdr means segregation distortion region.

the  <dig> segregation distortion markers were of three types including  <dig> 'snp_only’-type markers,  <dig> 'indel_only’-type markers, and  <dig> 'snp&indel’ markers with percentages of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. this distribution was similar to the percentages observed for all markers of the three types, but the distributions of the three types of segregation distortion markers were different for each lg . segregation distortion markers on lg <dig> and lg <dig> were all 'snp_only’-type markers and only two types of segregation distortion markers were observed on eight other lgs. 'snp_only’ and 'indel_only’ segregation distortion markers were located on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> and 'snp_only’ and 'snp&indel’ segregation distortion markers were located in lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> 

discussion
the need to develop markers for sesame by sequencing
according to published results of research on sesame, the genetic diversity is low between germplasm resources  <cit>  and genetic differences between cultivars are limited  <cit> . the close genetic relatedness between accessions could account for the low polymorphism of molecular markers. the polymorphism rates have been reported for a variety of markers in sesame including 20% for est-ssr  <cit> ,  <dig> % for est-ssr,  <dig> % for aflp,  <dig> % for rsampl  <cit> ,  <dig> % for genic-ssr  <cit> ,  <dig> % for cdna-ssr  <cit> , and  <dig> % for slaf markers . the limited quantity of available markers and their low polymorphism rate makes construction of a genetic linkage map with high-density markers for sesame almost impossible using conventional methods. genotyping by sequencing is a high-throughput technique that opens the door for the efficient development of large numbers of markers in a short time to generate enough polymorphic markers for high-density genetic map construction.

the advantages of slaf sequencing for developing markers
in contrast to inefficient, expensive, and time-consuming conventional methods of developing markers, bioinformatics analyses were carried out before slaf sequencing; the reference genome of sesame  was analyzed, considering the information on genomic gc content, repeat conditions, and genetic characteristics. we designed an approach to ensure density, uniformity, and efficiency of marker development. the slaf-seq method provided significant advantages such as the development of large numbers of markers having high accuracy with less sequencing, making it especially suited for analysis of species with low polymorphism like sesame. this study provides the first development of markers on large scale for sesame in total,  <dig>  slaf markers were developed based on high-throughput sequencing, and  <dig>  polymorphic markers were identified for genetic linkage map construction. marker integrity and accuracy were high and marker quality and quantity met the requirements for construction of a genetic map. results also accurately reflect the genetic and polymorphism characteristics of sesame, which added to our understanding of the genetics of this species.

use of segregation distortion markers increased the genome coverage of the map
because of the limited quantity of available molecular markers for sesame and their low polymorphism rate, additional markers such as segregation distortion markers should be used to construct a high-density genetic map. segregation distortion is a common phenomenon that has been observed in many studies. the genotypic frequency of a segregation distortion marker deviates from a typical mendelian ratio. this deviation may be caused by gametic selection  <cit> , zygotic selection  <cit> , or both. in this study, a genetic map was constructed first using mendelian markers. segregation distortion markers were then inserted in the existing map and the recombination fractions between markers were reestimated similar to the approach used by wang et al.  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> markers  were mapped onto the final map with a distribution on every lg, similar to the distribution of all markers. in addition to increasing the quantity of markers on the map, the genome coverage of the map increased. the presence of segregation distortion markers will not affect the use of this map for applications such as qtl mapping. xu  <cit>  showed that distorted markers can be used for qtl mapping with no detrimental effect on the results and can be beneficial if used properly. zhang et al.  <cit>  showed that segregation distortion could result in higher genetic variance than non-distortion and help to improve the detection of linked qtls because distortion markers do not have a large effect on the position or effect estimations of qtl analysis. a new method of qtl mapping that uses markers for segregation distortion was developed by xu and hu  <cit> .

future applications for the genetic map
to our knowledge, the genetic map presented in this paper is the densest map to date for sesame, though it is still not saturated, because it has  <dig> lgs, not  <dig> lgs as was expected. the map spans  <dig> .87 cm with an average number of  <dig>  markers per lg with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the average distance in this map is much less than the  <dig>  cm previously reported by wei et al.  <cit> . more importantly,  <dig> % of the markers on this genetic map are snps, the most abundant type of genetic variation between individuals. snps are sequence tagged markers with codominant inheritance so they are suitable for comparative genomic studies  <cit>  and association mapping  <cit> . the results of this study not only provide mass markers for sesame, but also provide data useful for gene/qtl fine mapping, map-based gene isolation, and molecular breeding. because these high-density linkage groups were constructed based on molecular markers developed at the whole genome level, they will serve as a reference for positioning sequence scaffolds on the physical map to assist in the assembly process of the sesame genome sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the first high-density genetic map for sesame. the map was constructed using an f <dig> population and was based on polymorphic markers developed using the slaf-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of markers in a short time. the results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/qtl fine mapping, map-based gene isolation, and molecular breeding for sesame, but will also provide a reference to help position sequence scaffolds on the physical map and assist in the process of assembling the sesame genome sequence.
