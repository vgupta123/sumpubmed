BACKGROUND
the major seed proteins of bread wheat  include gliadins and glutenins. these storage proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum  of starchy endosperm cells and accumulate in two kinds of protein bodies derived from the er and protein storage vacuoles  <cit> . many of the wheat seed storage proteins have intramolecular disulfide bonds  <cit> . for example, gliadins have three to four intramolecular disulfide bonds in the c-terminal domain. in the case of γ-gliadins, formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in the er has been demonstrated to be essential for transport to the golgi apparatus and deposition into protein bodies  <cit> . therefore, mutations in cysteine residues or the reduction of disulfide bonds result in precipitation into insoluble aggregates in the er  <cit> .

generally, the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins synthesized in the rough er occurs mainly via dithiol/disulfide transfer reactions catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase   and pdi-related proteins in eukaryotes  <cit> . pdi has two thioredoxin domains that contain the redox active site cghc  and two inactive domains   <cit> . other pdi family members contain one or more thioredoxin domains  <cit> . in dicotyledonous arabidopsis, a set of  <dig> orthologs of known pdi family proteins was discovered by a genome-wide search, and these orthologs were separated into phylogenetic groups i-x  <cit> .

the physiological functions and biochemical properties of several plant pdi family members have been studied. atpdil <dig>  an arabidopsis ortholog of group i pdi family proteins, is expressed in endothelial cells of developing seeds and traffics together with the cysteine proteases rd <dig> and cp <dig> from the er through the golgi to vacuoles  <cit> . studies of an atpdil5-null mutant revealed that atpdil <dig> is required for proper seed development and regulates the timing of programmed cell death by chaperoning and inhibiting cysteine proteases and serving as a redox-sensitive protease regulator during their trafficking to vacuoles before endothelial cells undergo programmed cell death. atpdil2- <dig>  an arabidopsis ortholog of group iv pdi family proteins, has been shown to act in maternal sporophytic tissues to affect embryo sac development  <cit> . a truncated atpdil2- <dig> mutant has been demonstrated to function as a gain-of-function mutant in sporophytic tissues and to affect ovule structure and impede embryo sac development, thereby disrupting pollen tube guidance.

in oldenlandia affinis, a coffee family  plant, oa pdi, an oldenlandia ortholog of group i pdi family proteins, has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the knotted circular proteins termed cyclotides  <cit> . in addition, oa pdi dramatically enhances the oxidative folding of kalata b <dig> at physiological ph in vitro.

gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdis- <dig> and − <dig>  and gmpdim, soybean orthologs of groups i-v pdi family proteins have been identified, and the recombinant proteins of gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdis- <dig>  gmpdis- <dig> and gmpdim, but not gmpdil- <dig>  have been demonstrated to possess oxidative refolding activities  <cit> . in addition, gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdil- <dig>  gmpdis- <dig>  and gmpdim have been shown to be involved in the folding of the soybean seed storage proteins proglycinin and β-conglycinin in the er of cotyledon cells.

in monocotyledonous rice, grains of the mutant eps, which lack the rice ortholog  of group i pdi proteins, fail to generate the normal prolamin-containing protein bodies-i and accumulate the 57-kd proglutelin polypeptide in aggregate with the prolamin polypeptides via intermolecular disulfide bonds in small er-derived protein bodies of uniform size   <cit> . in addition, pdil1- <dig> is asymmetrically distributed within the cortical cisternal er, and this ortholog is essential for the maturation of proglutelin only when its rate of synthesis significantly exceeds its export from the er. these findings suggest that rice pdil1- <dig> helps retain proglutelin in the cisternal er lumen until it attains competence for er export  <cit> . furthermore, analysis of the t-dna insertion mutant revealed that rice pdil1- <dig> deficiency causes a chalky phenotype, thick aleurone layer, lower protein content, and higher free sugar content in grains than the wild-type rice protein, suggesting that rice pdil1- <dig> is involved in regulatory activities for various proteins that are essential for the synthesis of grain components  <cit> . rice pdil2; <dig>  a rice ortholog of group v pdi family proteins, has been shown to be efficiently targeted to the surface of protein bodies-i in a redox active site-dependent manner and to play an important role in the accumulation of cys-rich 10-kd prolamin  in the core of pb-i  <cit> . complementation experiments using eps have indicated that rice pdil2; <dig> and pdil1; <dig> are not functionally redundant for disulfide bond formation in structurally diverse storage proteins and that these proteins play distinct roles in protein body development.

in wheat, the importance of pdi family proteins in seed storage protein folding and accumulation has been long predicted. oxidative refolding activity was first reported in the embryo of bread wheat in  <dig>  <cit> , and activity in the endosperm was subsequently reported  <cit> . in  <dig>  a cdna encoding a typical pdi was cloned. in addition, a 60-kd glycoprotein, which had a partial amino acid sequence homologous to the amino acid sequence predicted from the cdna, was purified from grains of bread wheat by shimoni et al.  <cit> . since then, many cdnas encoding wheat pdi family proteins have been identified  <cit> . furthermore, d’aloisio et al. reported the cloning of cdnas encoding one typical pdi categorized into group i and eight pdi family proteins categorized into groups ii-viii  <cit> . these investigators also found that genes encoding these pdi family proteins are located in chromosome regions syntenic to those in rice  <cit> . quantitative analysis of mrnas transcribed from these genes revealed that these genes were constitutively expressed in all tissues examined but were characterized by different expression profiles  <cit> . based on mrna expression data, pdi family proteins  have been proposed to play essential roles in grain development; however, the enzymatic activities of these individual proteins have not been characterized. in this study, we report the cloning of cdnas encoding bread wheat pdi family proteins of groups i-v  and characterization of the enzymatic properties of their recombinant proteins. in addition, this report describes the expression and subcellular localization of these pdi family proteins in developing and mature caryopses.

RESULTS
cloning of wheat pdi family genes
in this study, we harvested mrnas of bread wheat pdi family protein orthologs from groups i, ii, iii, iv, and v  <cit>  from the immature caryopses and performed pcr using primer sets designed from their nucleotide sequences as reported previously  <cit> . next, we generated and cloned the cdnas encoding these pdi orthologs. we obtained five clones categorized into group i  and one clone categorized into group ii , group iii , group iv  and group v  . among these clones, tapdil1aβ, tapdil1aγ, tapdil1aδ, and tapdil <dig> have novel nucleotide sequences. the domain structures predicted from the amino acid sequences encoded by these cdnas are shown in figure  <dig>  pdi family proteins categorized into group i are members of the representative eukaryotic pdi, which possesses an n-terminal signal sequence, two thioredoxin-like motifs with a cghc active site , two putative thioredoxin-folded domains without active site , and a c-terminal kdel sequence that functions as an er retention signal  <cit> . in earlier studies  <cit> , three genes  encoding group i pdi family proteins were shown to be located on chromosome arms 4al, 4bs, and 4ds, respectively. recently, the wheat genome draft sequences were deposited in the databases of the wheat portal   <cit> . nucleotide sequences of the cdnas of tapdil1aα, tapdil1aβ, tapdil1aγ, and tapdil1aδ were coincident with those of the tapdil1- <dig> gene and contigs on chromosome 4al. alignments of the nucleotide sequences of these cdna with the genomic nucleotide sequence of tapdil1a  suggested that they are produced by intron retention-type alternative splicing of the first exon   <cit> . tapdil1aα, tapdil1aβ, tapdil1aγ, and tapdil1aδ cdnas encoded proteins of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, respectively . tapdil1aβ, tapdil1aγ, and tapdil1aδ lack the amino acid sequences pro21-a <dig>  ala15-leu <dig>  and ala13-leu <dig> found in tapdil1aα, respectively. the putative signal peptides of tapdil1aγ and tapdil1aδ  were shorter than those of tapdil1aα and tapdil1aβ . the effects of such alterations in the signal peptide on tapdil1a protein targeting to the er are unclear. the nucleotide sequence of tapdil1b cdna was matched to that of gpdia-4b, the tapdil1- <dig> genomic gene   <cit> , and contigs on chromosome 4bs. tapdil1aα, −1β, −1γ, and -1δ and tapdil1b have a conserved arginine involved in the regulation of the active site redox potential and a conserved glutamic acid that facilitates the release of the active site from a mixed disulfide with substrate in human pdi  <cit>  in both the a and a’ domains .table  <dig>

the tapdil <dig> cdna encoded a 585- amino acid protein , and the nucleotide sequence of tapdil <dig> cdnas was 99% identical to that of tapdil2- <dig>  <cit> . no contig sequences matched with the sequence of tapdil <dig> cdna found in the wheat genome draft sequences. the putative amino acid sequence of tapdil <dig> was also 99% identical to that of tapdil2- <dig> . tapdil <dig> was categorized as a group ii pdi family protein that possesses an n-terminal signal sequence, aspartic acid-rich flanking region, two thioredoxin-like motifs with a cghc active site , two putative thioredoxin-folded domains without active sites , and a c-terminal kdel sequence. tapdil <dig> also has a conserved arginine and a conserved glutamic acid in both the a and a’ domains .

the tapdil3a cdna encoded a 541-amino acid protein , and the nucleotide sequence was matched to contigs on chromosome 7as. tapdil3a was categorized as a group iii pdi family protein and possesses the same domain structure as tapdil1a . however, the sequences of the active sites in the a and a’ domains  differ from the representative motif cghc. in addition, tapdil3a lacks the conserved glutamic acid in the a domain, as well as the conserved arginine in the a and a’ domains .

the nucleotide sequence of the tapdil4d cdna was matched to that of contigs on chromosome 1as. tapdil4d was categorized as a group iv pdi family protein, which is unique to plants and possesses an n-terminal signal peptide, two thioredoxin-like motifs with a cghc active site , and a domain homologous to the c-terminal domain of mammalian erp <dig>   <cit> .

tapdil5a was categorized as a group v pdi family protein. this sequence encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids that is homologous to mammalian p <dig>  <cit> , and the nucleotide sequence of tapdil5a cdna was matched to that of contigs on chromosome 5al. tapdil5a possesses an n-terminal signal peptide, two thioredoxin-like motifs with a cghc active site , a putative thioredoxin-folded b domain, and a c-terminal ndel sequence similar to kdel . tapdil4d and tapdil5a contain a conserved arginine and a conserved glutamic acid in both the a and a’ domains .

expression and characterization of recombinant wheat pdi family proteins
to investigate the enzymatic properties of wheat pdi family proteins, recombinant proteins without the putative n-terminal signal peptide were prepared from cdnas of tapdil1aα, tapdil1b, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, and tapdil5a using an escherichia coli  expression system, and then the proteins were purified . all recombinant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins  and eluted in a monomeric form from a gel filtration column . all recombinant tapdil family proteins had circular dichroism  spectra typical of well-folded α/β-type proteins .figure  <dig> 
expression of recombinant wheat pdi family proteins. recombinant tapdil1aα , tapdil1b , tapdil <dig> , tapdil3a , tapdl4d , and tapdil5a  were expressed in e. coli. cells transformed with each expression plasmid and incubated with  <dig>  mm iptg at 30°c for  <dig>  or 20 h . soluble  and insoluble  fractions were separated from these cells after 20 h by centrifugation after sonication. each recombinant pdi family protein  was purified by his-tag column chromatography  followed by gel filtration chromatography . proteins in each sample were separated by sds-page and stained with coomassie brilliant blue.  the cd spectra of the purified recombinant tapdil1aα , tapdil1b , tapdil <dig> , tapdil3a , tapdl4d , and tapdil5a  were determined at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml.  the purified recombinant tapdil1aα , tapdil1b , tapdil <dig> , tapdil3a , tapdil4d , or tapdil5a  was detected by western blot analysis with anti-tapdil1aα serum , anti-tapdil <dig> serum , anti-tapdil3a serum , anti-tapdil4d serum , or anti-tapdil5a serum . asterisks indicate degradation products.



the oxidative refolding activities of these recombinant proteins were analyzed with reduced and denatured ribonuclease a  as a substrate. both tapdil1aα and tapdil1b exhibited higher activities than the other recombinant pdi family proteins . furthermore, the activities of tapdil1aα and tapdil1b were approximately  <dig> -fold higher than that of the recombinant soybean ortholog gmpdil- <dig>  <cit>  despite 63% share identity in amino acid sequence . the activity of tapdil <dig> was nearly identical to that of soybean ortholog gmpdil- <dig>  <cit> , which has an amino acid sequence with 62% shared identity . the recombinant tapdil3a had no oxidative refolding activity similar to soybean gmpdil <dig>  <cit> . the lack of oxidative refolding activity of tapdil3a and gmpdil- <dig> is thought to stem from their atypical active site motifs and the lack of a conserved arginine that is necessary for active site activity as described above. furthermore, the activity of tapdil4d was approximately three- to four-fold higher than those of soybean orthologs, gmpdis- <dig> and gmpdis- <dig>  <cit> , even though 75% and 74%, respectively, of the amino acid sequences are identical . finally, tapdil5a exhibited approximately four-fold greater activity than that of the soybean ortholog gmpdim  <cit> , which shares a 79% identical amino acid sequence .table  <dig>

expression of pdi family proteins in wheat caryopses
we generated antiserum using recombinant tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, or tapdil5a as an antigen. each antiserum cross-reacted with the recombinant protein used for the immunization . the antiserum against tapdil1aα also cross-reacted with recombinant tapdil1b. the expression of each pdi family protein in wheat caryopses was confirmed by western blot analyses with these sera. the sera against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, and tapdil5a recognized a 60-, 70-, 69-, 40-, and 47-kda band, respectively, on gels containing proteins extracted from caryopses of bread wheat . because anti-tapdil1aα serum cross-reacted with recombinant tapdil1b, a highly conserved protein categorized as group i pdi family proteins, it is likely that splicing variants of tapdil1aα, tapdil1b, and tapdil1- <dig>  <cit>  may all be detected by western blot analysis with this serum. likewise, the sera against tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, and tapdil5a were presumed to cross-react with their homolog categorized into group ii, iii, iv, or v, respectively. thus, the proteins that cross-reacted with sera against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, or tapdil5a were referred to as tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  or tapdil <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig> 
expression of wheat pdi family proteins in wheat caryopses.  proteins  extracted from the caryopses at  <dig>  or  <dig>  dap were analyzed by western blot with serum against tapdil1aα , tapdil <dig> , tapdil3a , tapdil4d , tapdil5a , calreticulin , or ero <dig> .  tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  and tapdil <dig> are high mannose-type n-glycosylated proteins in wheat caryopses. the proteins extracted from the caryopses were treated with  or without  endoglycosidase h  or endoglycosidase f . the proteins  were separated by sds-page and immunostained with serum against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, or tapdil5a.



the sizes of the bands that cross-reacted with anti-tapdil4d and anti-tapdil5a sera approached the molecular sizes calculated from the amino acid sequences of tapdl4d and tapdil5a, respectively, in the absence of the signal peptide. the sizes of bands that cross-reacted with the sera against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  and tapdil3a were larger than the calculated molecular sizes based on the amino acid sequences of these pdi family proteins without the signal peptide, but these proteins contain one or two consensus n-glycosylation sites, suggesting that these pdi family proteins contain n-glycan. when caryopses proteins were digested with endoglycosidase h or f, the masses of the bands that were recognized by the sera against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  and pdil3a became smaller , supporting the notion of n-glycosylation of these proteins in wheat caryopses. because endoglycosidase h specifically cleaves high mannose-type oligosaccharides but not complex oligosaccharides from glycoproteins, these results indicate that the oligosaccharides attached to tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  and tapdil <dig> are high mannose-type oligosaccharides. in agreement with these findings, tapdil <dig> purified from wheat was previously shown to be a glycoprotein  <cit> . in addition to pdi family proteins, we examined wheat orthologs of calreticulin and er oxidoreductin  <dig>  using western blot analyses. calreticulin acts cooperatively with the human pdi family protein er-60/erp <dig> to fold monoglycosylated n-glycoproteins  <cit> . ero <dig> is a pdi-activating enzyme located in the er  <cit> . the active centers of pdi family proteins oxidize cysteine residues in substrate proteins and become a reduced form. pdi family proteins require other oxidizing molecules such as ero <dig> for reoxidation of their active center cysteine residues. the sera against calreticulin and ero <dig> cross-reacted with a 52-kda band and 63-kda band, respectively . these band sizes were similar to those calculated from the putative amino acid sequences of the wheat orthologs of calreticulin  and ero <dig>   <cit> .

the expression levels of the pdi family proteins, calreticulin, and ero <dig> in the caryopses during maturation were determined by western blot analyses . in addition, the levels of each of the pdi family proteins in bread wheat caryopses and flour were semi-quantitatively assessed by determining their band intensities on western blots . levels of tapdil <dig> in the caryopses were highest at 10– <dig> dpa, which corresponds to the time of greatest synthesis of the seed storage proteins such as gliadins and glutenins . the levels of tapdil <dig>  tapdil <dig>  and tapdil <dig> in caryopses were also highest at 5– <dig> dpa in the maturing period. the level of tapdil <dig> in the caryopses was highest at  <dig> dpa and then decreased with time. the content of tapdil <dig> was the highest among pdi family proteins . the expression of tapdil <dig> mrna in the developing caryopses has been reported to be the highest of those of pdi family proteins  <cit> . the expression of wheat ero <dig> was highest at  <dig> dpa . wheat ero <dig> may activate wheat pdi family proteins, but whether plant ero <dig> activates plant pdi family proteins in vivo remains unproven. knockdown of rice ero <dig>  revealed that native disulfide bond formation in proglutelins depends on an electron transfer pathway involving osero <dig>  <cit> . wheat calreticulin was also highly expressed during the period of grain filling . levels of all pdi family proteins, calreticulin, and ero <dig> were drastically diminished in the late maturing period  when grain weights decreased due to desiccation ; however, low levels of pdi family proteins remained even in the mature grains. calreticulin and ero <dig> were not detected in the 25– <dig> dpa caryopses or in the mature grains.figure  <dig>

localization of pdi family proteins in wheat caryopses
localization of each pdi family protein in the immature wheat caryopses at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. the antisera for pdi family proteins were confirmed to specifically react with their respective native recombinant pdi family protein . the aleurone cells, pericarp, and starchy endosperm of the caryopsis were labeled with the sera raised against tapdil1aα, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, tapdil4d, or tapdil5a . these distributions suggest that these pdi family proteins are required for folding nascent proteins that are synthesized de novo in these tissues during grain development.figure  <dig>

the tapdil <dig> group proteins, tapdil <dig>  tapdil3a, and tapdil5a contain putative signal peptides as well as the c-terminal er retention signal. therefore, these pdi family proteins were expected to localize to the er. in addition, the er-localization of tapdil4d, which has an n-terminal signal peptide but no c-terminal er retention signal, was also predicted because soybean orthologs gmpdis- <dig> and gmpdis- <dig> localize to the er  <cit> . the er-localization of all pdi family proteins in the starchy endosperm was indicated by their network-like distribution in the cytoplasm and co-localization with calreticulin, a well-known er luminal protein . in the starchy endosperm, peripheral regions of a-type starch granules were strongly immunostained with anti-pdi family and anti-calreticulin sera, suggesting that the er was densely packed around the starch granules. the existence of all wheat pdi family proteins in the er of the starchy endosperm cells during grain filling suggests that these factors play important roles in the folding of storage proteins such as gliadins and glutenins, which are synthesized and folded in the er. γ-gliadin has been shown to require pdi family proteins for folding by in vitro translational experiment  <cit> . in the aleurone cells, members of all five groups of pdi family proteins were labeled along with calreticulin in the periphery of aleurone grains and network structure , suggesting localization of these proteins to the er. in aleurone grains, storage proteins accumulate during seed development  <cit> . these pdi family proteins may assist in the folding of storage proteins synthesized in the er of the aleurone cells, and the resultant folded storage proteins accumulate in the aleurone grains. however, the specific details of the transport of storage proteins from the er to aleurone grains remains unclear. in addition, the five groups of pdi family proteins were also detected at the boundaries of aleurone cells. the localization mechanism and physiological roles of those pdi family proteins at the aleurone cell boundary remain to be elucidated.figure  <dig>

in the mature grains, the members of the five groups of pdi family proteins were labeled in the aleurone cells and starchy endosperm . in the aleurone cells of the mature wheat grain, the er has been found in two regions: the periphery of the aleurone grain-spherosome complex and the cytoplasm as spread network structures  <cit> . the periphery of the aleurone grain-spherosome complex was mainly labeled with antisera to the five anti-pdi family proteins and calreticulin . based on these findings, we predict that the pdi family proteins that localized in the aleurone cells of the mature grain accumulated prior to grain formation and function in folding newly synthesized hydrolytic enzymes in the er during germination. in mature cereal grain endosperm, only aleurone cells are alive  <cit> . when cereal grains imbibe water, α-amylases and cysteine proteinases, which may contain intramolecular disulfide bonds  <cit> , are synthesized in the er of the aleurone cells in response to gibberellic acid secretion into the endosperm from the embryo via the scutellum  <cit> . these hydrolytic enzymes are secreted to the starchy endosperm to break down starch and protein that accumulated in the starchy endosperm to supply carbon and nitrogen used in germination. whereas the secretion of α-amylases and cysteine proteases from the aleurone layers increased in response to gibberellic acid treatment for 24 h, the level of the barley tapdil- <dig> ortholog was not affected by gibberellic acid treatment  <cit> , suggesting that the barley tapdil- <dig> ortholog that remains in the aleurone cell of the wheat grain may help fold the newly synthesized hydrolytic enzymes.figure  <dig>

during the late stage of maturation, the starchy endosperm cells undergo programmed cell death, and the protein bodies fuse to the protein matrix  <cit> . the analyzed members of the five groups of pdi family proteins were distributed throughout the fused protein matrix . because wheat flour arises from milled starchy endosperm, the five groups of pdi family proteins must be present in flour . we previously detected oxidative refolding activity in an extract from wheat flour, and its activity was inhibited by the pdi inhibitor bacitracin  <cit> . therefore, pdi family proteins may be active in both the starchy endosperm of the dry mature grain and flour. it is unclear whether the pdi family proteins that remain in the starchy endosperm of the wheat grain play a physiological role during germination. further studies are needed to identify the substrate proteins associated with each pdi family protein in vivo and to determine the effects of knockdown of these factors on wheat phenotypes, such as seed storage protein accumulation and plant body growth. furthermore, pdi family proteins may affect the quality of food products. we previously demonstrated that pdi family proteins play a role in retaining glutenin macropolymers during dough mixing, and these polymers are the most important factor for dough’s tensile strength  <cit> . we semi-quantitatively analyzed the levels of the five pdi family protein groups in a wheat flour sample  and found that among the five groups of pdi family proteins, tapdil <dig> levels were the highest. because the oxidative refolding activities of recombinant tapdil1a and tapdil1b were the strongest of the five recombinant pdi family proteins, tapdil <dig> may primarily function in retaining glutenin macropolymers during dough mixing. therefore, pdi family proteins may be an important contributing factor to the quality wheat flour, and they may serve as targets for genetic manipulation in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in eukaryotes, pdi and pdi family proteins function in multiple essential capacities such as oxidative folding of nascent proteins, molecular chaperoning, antigen presentation, degradation of abnormal proteins, and redox signaling. most information about such functions has been obtained from mammalian cell studies. the physiological functions and functional mechanisms of plant pdi family proteins remain largely unknown. here, we demonstrated that four of the five groups of wheat pdi family proteins exhibit oxidative refolding activity on reduced and denatured rnasea. all five groups of pdi family proteins were highly expressed throughout the caryopses and in particular, in the starchy endosperm during grain filling. as expected from their primary structures, these proteins localized to the er. these results suggest that pdi family proteins play an important role in folding seed storage proteins synthesized in the er. in mature grain, the pdi family proteins from all five groups remain in the er surrounding the aleurone grains of the aleurone cells and the protein matrix of the starchy endosperm. because many of the hydrolytic enzymes are synthesized and folded in the er of the aleurone cells and secreted to the starchy endosperm to break down starch and storage proteins during the early stage of germination, these pdi family proteins may function in folding nascent hydrolytic enzymes. in conclusion, our work provides significant basic information about the physiological functions of these pdi family proteins during the wheat life cycle. in the future, it will be necessary to identify the in vivo substrate proteins and determine the effects of selective silencing of pdi family genes on wheat phenotypes with respect to seed storage protein folding, transport, and accumulation; seed germination; and plant body growth.
