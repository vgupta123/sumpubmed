BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen, identified as the infectious agent of the legionnaire's disease  or legionellosis in  <dig>  <cit> . it is found in aquatic environments parasitizing its natural hosts, amoebae and protozoa. from this environment, legionella can colonize water treatment plants, such as refrigeration towers, potable water pipes, etc., and can cause infections in humans, when infected aerosols are inhaled  <cit> . despite efforts to keep water systems free of legionella, this pathogen is still causing infection throughout the world, including spain, where it is endemic in some areas. from  <dig> to  <dig>  around  <dig> outbreaks with  <dig>  cases were recorded worldwide. in  <dig> and  <dig> there were two important epidemic events with  <dig>  and  <dig>  cases respectively. in alcoy, an industrial town in the valencian region , a large outbreak occurred during 1999- <dig>  a strain that had caused several outbreaks and many cases, named "alcoy 2300/99", was isolated from a patient in that outbreak  <cit> . since then, recurrent epidemics in alcoy have harbored alcoy 2300/ <dig> 

currently, the genomes of five l. pneumophila strains are available: philadelphia   <cit> , lens  and paris   <cit> , corby   <cit>  and alcoy  . as with the majority of other pathogenic legionella strains, immunoassay analysis defined them as belonging to the serogroup  <dig>  <cit> . a phylogeny based on multi locus sequence typing  showed that all strains are closely related, alcoy and corby being the closest  <cit> .

several features relating to the virulence of l. pneumophila are well known. for example, the mechanisms responsible for entry into the macrophages  <cit> , the intracellular  trafficking of effectors  <cit>  and the membrane-associated protein involved in virulence  <cit> . the data available disclose an almost complete physiology of this organism and its relationships with protozoa and human macrophages. an interesting question relating to l. pneumophila is its high rate of dna exchange, not only within species and other closely-related bacteria, but also with eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . comparative genomics can give clues about the extent of this process. nowadays, the genome sequencing of strains belonging to the same species offers the possibility of defining their pangenome, which helps in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of microbial species. the pangenome comprises the core-genome, made up of the genes shared by all strains, and the accessory or dispensable genome compartment, consisting of the genes that are strain-specific or shared by only some of the strains  <cit> . pangenome studies can disclose characteristics that are not easily perceptible using standard annotation analysis  <cit> . for example, pangenome studies have facilitated identification of virulence factors or anti-drugs systems in escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae  <cit> . the dispensable genome compartment can provide evidence of lateral gene transfer events that have occurred during the evolutionary history of a strain, probably offering additional evolutionary potential to the organism.

in this work, we report the main genomic features of l. pneumophila strain alcoy 2300/ <dig> and compare it with the four previously sequenced strains. a detailed description of the l. pneumophila pangenome is provided, and strain-specific features are catalogued in terms of "islands". several islands containing virulence factors were identified and, where possible, their evolutionary origins were also hypothesized. although the strains are phylogenetically closely related, the pangenomic approach allowed identification of distinctive features, such as anti-drug related islands, strain-specific transport or secretion systems, dna transfer-related islands, crispr  systems, and integrated phage insertions.

RESULTS
general features of the l. pneumophila alcoy  genome
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences were obtained by the sanger method  and 454-technology , respectively. the contigs were finally assembled in one continuous strand, with average consensus coverage of  <dig>  Ã—. the lpa chromosome length was of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, and  <dig>  open reading frames were identified. the gc content was 38% and  <dig>  predicted proteins were found to have unknown functions, representing  <dig> % of all cdss. similar to lpc and lpg genomes, no plasmids were found in lpa. table  <dig> summarizes the main features of this genome compared to the other four l. pneumophila sequenced strains.

pangenome of l. pneumophila
lpa and lpc are the strains that share most genes;  <dig>  out of  <dig>  in lpa  and  <dig>  in lpc . this result is in agreement with the phylogenetic tree obtained using mlst  <cit> . compared with the remaining genomes, lpa and lpc share  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes with lpl;  <dig>   and  <dig>   with lpp; and  <dig>   and  <dig>   with lpg, respectively. similarly, lpp and lpl also seem to be close-related with a shared genome of  <dig>  genes out of  <dig>  for lpl  and  <dig>  for lpp . finally, lpg seems to be the most distantly related, sharing  <dig>  genes with lpl  and  <dig>   with lpp.

functional classification of core and dispensable genes
genes belonging to the core and dispensable genomes have been classified according to their predicted function based on cog categories . l. pneumophila is characterized by quite a high number of hypothetical proteins, for which annotation is still incomplete. of the  <dig>  genes belonging to the core genome,  <dig>   were attributed to a cog category , and in the case of dispensable genome, only  <dig> out of  <dig> . these results are in agreement with those obtained in other studies, where hypothetical genes, and even genes with unknown function are, in the majority, in the dispensable genome  <cit> . although the major proportion of the cdss for which a function could be predicted  falls within the core genome, minor differences between the two compartments were observed for defense mechanisms  and intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport  categories.

genomic islands
although the five strains are highly syntenic, most of the genes that do not belong to the core genome are part of genomic islands, absent in at least one of the genomes. table  <dig> reports the islands identified for each strain, figure  <dig> describes the island positions for each genome following table  <dig> classifications, while figure 5a shows the hypothesis of islands histories according to the mlst tree topology obtained by d'auria et al.  <cit> . figure 5b shows the alignment of the five genomes, the locally collinear blocks and the position of the islands according to their genome locations. twenty-eight islands were identified belonging to six different types . only one island  is present in all five genomes; eighteen are strain-specific, probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer  events; five are common to lpa/lpc genomes , whereas one island  could be interpreted as having been lost in the common ancestor of lpa/lpc genomes.

first column describes the name of the island and the genome of provenance. following columns report a short description, the position on the genomes, the number of cdss contained in the island, the length, the presence /absence  of transposase genes and the gc content.

resistance-related islands 
we have identified two types of resistance-related islands, r <dig> and r <dig> . r <dig> maintains the same position, around  <dig> kb at the beginning of the chromosome, in the five strains, inserted in a trnaasn site, although the organization and content is different. in lpa, lpc and lpg, the island is similar and contains several hypothetical proteins as well as a methylase , followed by a multi-drug resistance protein . in the paris strain, the island also begins with a methylase  and in the lens strain with a putative transposase . however, although the position of the gene coding for the methylase is quite similar in both genomes, the alignment is different, due to a relatively big deletion in lpl, whereas in lpp it is followed by the antibiotic persistence-related system hipb/hipa  with no homolog in other legionella strains. although the mechanism of this system is still not well known, much evidence points to hipa as a toxin with bacteriostatic activity which binds dna/rna, blocking macromolecule synthesis until hipb binds hipa, releasing the dna/rna so microbial cells can survive extended exposure to drugs  <cit> . this island is followed by various phage-related proteins, elements of the xre family of transcriptional regulators, an lvra protein, and three transporters  of which the lpp <dig> is similar to the acriflavine multi-drug efflux pump  <cit> . finally, the island ends with three hypothetical proteins and an is4-family transposase . several genes such as the trak, the lvra-related protein and the phage-related integrases are also maintained in the same positions in the alcoy, corby, lens and philadelphia strains. a similar system , was also found in the lens strain. it is a small region containing transposases as well as two homologs of a stability system stbde . this island was originally associated with plasmids  <cit> , but it has also been found on the chromosomes of other pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

transport/secretion systems 
only one ts island has been found in the lpa and lpc genomes. ts <dig> in the alcoy strain is composed of  <dig> orfs . three of these orfs, lpa <dig>  lpa <dig> and lpa <dig>  are related to the cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux helabc transport system that provides resistance against these heavy metals  <cit> . they are followed by lpa <dig>  which codes for the metallo-regulator arsr that, in the presence of metals, derepresses the operator/promotor dna, thereby activating the transcription of downstream genes  <cit> . as happens in other islands, this ends with a phage integrase and three transposase-related orfs, indicating a possible exogenous origin in legionella. it is worth mentioning that all five genomes carry a helabc operon belonging to the core genome, while alcoy and corby strains also possess the two additional above-mentioned systems.

in the corby strain, ts <dig> is bigger than in the alcoy, spanning about  <dig> kb. it contains the previously mentioned helabc operon , in addition to the helabc systems present as part of the core genome , a transposase  and a phage repressor protein . the first  <dig> orfs of the ts1c island  are syntenic with the paris nd <dig> island . the island continues for about  <dig> kb with apparently no synteny with other genomes and then regains synteny with the paris nd <dig> island.

interestingly, the ts1a-helabc genes seem to be more similar to the core lpl operon than to that of lpc ts <dig> while ts1c-helabc genes are more similar to those of the lpg genome. conversely, core helabc genes in lpa and lpc are highly related.

dna transfer-related islands 
three dt islands have been identified . dt <dig> and dt <dig> correspond to the trb- <dig> and trb- <dig> islands described by glÃ¶ckner and collaborator for the corby strain  <cit> . we have found that both islands are also present in the alcoy strain, although dt2a is shorter than dt2c, thus suggesting that lpa and lpc acquired these systems via dna transfer prior to their divergence . some remarkable features of dt <dig> are: a phage repressor , a set of tra and trb  operons, a putative lamboid prophage rac integrase , another integrase , an htpx protease , and a prophage regulatory protein alpa . in the dt <dig> island, both strains share a putative rna helicase , two putative restriction enzymes  and the set of the tra and trb operons. glÃ¶ckner and collaborators  <cit>  described that trb- <dig>  is active and could be transferred to other legionella. in both genomes, dt <dig> and dt <dig> are integrated, respectively, at the tmrna and trnapro sites.

finally, we have identified a dna transfer island, dt <dig>  in all strains with the exception of the corby and alcoy ones. it is worth mentioning that this island was previously described in lpg and lpp, as an integrated plasmid-like element  <cit> . it contains lvh , a type iv secretion system involved in conjugation  <cit> . the lvr  is located downstream where lvra is homologous to the csra repressor, important for the inhibition of post-exponential phase activity   <cit> . a crispr system was identified at the beginning of this island.

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  systems 
crispr are bacteriophage resistance systems  <cit>  that have been identified in the alcoy and lens , and in paris  strains . lpl also possesses one almost identical crispr system on the plasmid. phylogenetic analyses reveal how alcoy cas  genes are more closely related to the ones on the plasmidic crispr of the lens strain than to the chromosomal one. the cas genes identified were cas <dig> , cas3-helicase , and lpa <dig> and lpa <dig>  which are two conserved proteins in bacteria, but with no relatives in other legionella genomes. lpa <dig>  plpl <dig> and lpl <dig> belong to the crispr-associated csy <dig> family proteins . downstream of this cluster of proteins begins the repeats of the crispr system . the alcoy and lens strain repeats are almost identical, except for one base actgccgcacaggcagcttagaa). fifty-seven direct repeats were found in lpa, while  <dig> in the lpl plasmid, and two clusters of  <dig> and  <dig> on the lpl chromosome. none of the alcoy spacers were found to be similar to other spacers from the crispr database  <cit> .

the paris strain genome hosts a crispr system, located at the beginning of the dt <dig> island. the first crispr-related protein is coded by lpp <dig> and shows a weak similarity to a putative crispr-associated large protein. the cluster is followed by cas <dig> , cas <dig> , cas <dig>  and  <dig> direct repeats. interestingly, the repeats and the crispr-associated genes are not related to the ones found in the lpa and lpl genomes.

phage related islands 
up to seven different phage-related islands have been found. the alcoy and corby strains share pr <dig> and pr <dig> whereas all the other pr islands are strain-specific. pr <dig> in lpa and lpc are almost syntenic and could be considered an ancient infection that took place before the split of the two lineages; a related region is also present in lpg genome. this island contains several phage-related proteins, several transposases belonging to the is <dig> family, an mvin virulence factor , as well as other not well-defined proteins containing dna cleavage or binding related domains. the mvinn-related protein is additional, but not equivalent to the constitutive one present on the chromosomes  of the five strains . mvinn has been described as an important factor of virulence in salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia pseudomallei  <cit> . although its role in pathogenicity is still not clear, this protein is a homolog of the proposed lipid ii flippase protein  <cit>  that has no virulence activity.

pr <dig> is specific to the philadelphia strain and relies on a probable hot spot region. it contains six residual transposase-related orfs followed by four hypothetical proteins that correspond to the beginning of the dt1ac islands.

pr <dig>  as stated above, has been found only in the corby and alcoy strains. it begins with an ankyrin repeat-containing protein . ankyrin-domain-containing proteins have a eukaryotic origin and are related to intracellular trafficking. in legionella ankyrin-containing proteins may be secreted by the dot/icm system and could play a role in intracellular bacterial replication  <cit> . the island also contains several hypothetical proteins  and a transposase .

pr <dig> is specific to the lens strain genome and spans around  <dig> kb. it seems to be a residual plasmid integrated into the chromosome, based on the presence of several proteins relating to dna organization, such as lpl <dig> containing snf2-related protein domains that seem to be similar to helicases, and an omp/motb domain-containing protein  that may be related to structural flagella membrane proteins. several phage-related proteins and transposases were found, together with another predicted inner membrane protein . moreover, this island contains an orf similar to dna damage-inducible protein j , and the last two orfs  have high homology to other plasmid maintenance killer/antidote systems. the latter has been identified in several gram-negative-related plasmids and it is known as a regulator of bacterial programmed cellular death, although in some cases  it is also integrated into the chromosome  <cit> .

the alcoy-specific island pr <dig> is integrated into a -trnaile site. the first three orfs code for proteins related to transposases, whereas the remainder code for hypothetical proteins with no clear function. none of these proteins appear to have any relationship with other legionella-related orfs, and seem to be a clear case of acquisition by hgt. three genes with no clear function, trak gene , an inner membrane protein , and one hypothetical protein , have been found to be syntenic with the lpg and lpl genomes . lpa <dig> is similar to a phage-related integrase. the next orfs  are related to a cluster of genes involved in bacilysin synthesis, known as one of the simplest antibiotic peptides active against some bacteria and fungi  <cit>  .

pr <dig> in the philadelphia genome includes homologs of a type iv secretion system, mobile genetic elements, and virulence factors. it has been described in detail by brassinga and collaborator  as a  <dig> kb pathogenicity island  <cit> .

finally, the island pr <dig> in the paris genome codes almost exclusively for hypothetical proteins. only a putative primase/helicase , and a phage integrase  homolog seems to relate this island to phage integration with an unpredicted function.

not defined island 
up to thirteen islands, for which it has not been possible to establish a clear role, have been identified. interestingly, all but one , are strain-specific islands. nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> are found in the paris genome. nd <dig> hosts a complete cytochrome o cluster  and a glycine/betaine transporter. nd <dig> contains hypothetical proteins, a csra , and is located close to the chromosomal heavy metals regulatory genes . nd <dig> is formed by two hypothetical proteins followed by the hupe/urej membrane protein , homologs of nickel/cobalt type ii transport systems  <cit> . these elements are followed by a thiocyanate hydrolase cluster for subunits gamma, alpha and beta  that were previously identified as unique to the paris genome when compared to that from lens  <cit> . this enzyme is the first key step in thiocyanate degradation and it is important in the detoxification processes  <cit> . nd <dig> is a small island composed mainly of transposases. finally, for nd <dig> and nd <dig>  it was not possible to propose a role. nd <dig> and nd <dig> are specific to the philadelphia strains. nd <dig> is a small island containing hypothetical proteins and transposases, whereas nd <dig> contains a whole set of transposases and phage integrases as well as hypothetical proteins. nd <dig> and nd <dig> are specific to the corby strain. nd <dig> spans a  <dig> kb region in the corby genome with no apparently exogenous genes; it contains mainly hypothetical proteins, although some orfs seem to be related to acetyltransferases. nd <dig> is syntenic with the terminal part of the lpp island nd <dig> and, similarly, consists of hypothetical proteins. nd <dig> was found to be syntenic in both the alcoy and corby genomes and contains transposases and hypothetical proteins. nd <dig> and nd <dig> islands were found only in the lens strains. nd <dig> is another not well-defined island consisting mostly of hypothetical proteins. it contains an orf related to filamentation induced by a camp protein , an incomplete homolog of a hipa system, as well as the r1p island hipa/hipb system. finally nd <dig> is made up exclusively of hypothetical proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the virulence and persistence of l. pneumophila are mainly due to specific mechanisms coded by part of its core genome that makes l. pneumophila able to infect, survive and replicate in macrophages  <cit> . lpc has been described as one of the most virulent strains  <cit> , while lpp is responsible for sporadic cases but is frequently recognized worldwide  <cit> . lpl was responsible for important outbreaks in france during 2003- <dig> with  <dig> registered cases resulting in  <dig> deaths  <cit> . finally, although the lpg strain was the first one isolated for which the genome sequence was defined, it turned out to be not so virulent as the other  <cit> .

comparative genomics of five strains isolated in different parts of the world of l. pneumophila disclosed the presence of several hgt-related islands and an evident history of recombination events. here, we reported a number of features connected to virulence that could have been exchanged, or acquired by the strains along with their evolution. the traces of these events are mainly part of the dispensable genome compartment.

the islands encountered from the dispensable pangenome compartment of the five genomes revealed factors that can give additional virulence to each strain. alcoy and corby strains are those in which more islands have been found related to virulence and dna transfer activities. multi-drug efflux systems have been found in lpa, lpc and lpg, while stability systems have been found in lpl and lpp genomes . lpa and lpc strains are probably potentially more resistant in the presence of heavy metals, due to an additional helabc system in the ts <dig> island. moreover, lpa and lpc seem to have acquired, before to their lineage split, the ability to be more successful in dna transfer by the dt1ac and dt2ac systems. interestingly, alcoy strain also acquired a complete bacilysin system , probably by precedent phage contact after separation from the corby lineage, which could represent an environmentally competitive advantage for this virulent strain. lpa, lpc the lpg also carry an additional mvin virulence factor, although there is no experimental evidence of its activity . moreover alcoy, as well as lens and paris, proved to carry phage resistance systems . several additional specific features have also been reported, although their role could not be predicted.

finally, the data reported in this work show that the alcoy strain possesses additional features, making it different from other previously sequenced genomes, even with the most closely related corby strain. this finding could be related to the recurrent and sometimes mortal outbreaks recorded in the spanish town of alcoy.
