BACKGROUND
rnase p catalyzes the maturation of 5'-termini of all trnas by a single endonucleolytic cleavage of their precursors <cit> . this enzyme is found in cells from all three domains of life: the bacteria, eukaryote and archaea  <cit> . one of the unique features of rnase p is its ability to recognize the structures, rather than the sequences, of trnas; this allows the enzyme to cleave other substrates with similar structure to the trna precursor. accordingly, any complex of two rna molecules that resembles a similar trna molecule can be recognized and cleaved by rnase p  <cit> . one of the two rna molecules that resemble the complex is termed the external guide sequence . in principle, an mrna sequence can be targeted for rnase p cleavage by hybridization with egs to direct rnase p to the cleavage site. subsequent studies have shown that egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in many organisms, such as bacteria,  <cit>  mammalian cells  <cit> and maize cells <cit> .

nucleic-acid-based gene-interference strategies, such as anti-sense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, and rnai, are powerful research tools and promising therapeutic agents for human diseases  <cit> . each technology has advantages and limitations in terms of targeting efficacy and specificity  <cit> . compared with other nucleic-acid-based gene-interference strategies, such as the rnai approach that induces the cellular risc rnase to cleave a target mrna  <cit> , targeted cleavage of mrna by rnase p using an egs is a unique approach that can be used to inactivate any rna of known sequence expressed in vivo. moreover two types of interaction govern the targeting specificity of egs <cit> . one is the watson-crick base-pairing interaction between the anti-sense domain of an egs and the accessible region of a target mrna. the other is the interaction between a target mrna and the other domains of an egs, which are required for folding of the rnase p-recognizable tertiary structure.

several egss derived from natural trna sequences have been shown to be effective in blocking gene expression in bacteria <cit>  and mammalian cells <cit> . for example, the "3/ <dig> egs" resembles three-quarters of the trna molecule and consists of two sequence elements: a targeting sequence that is complementary to the accessible region of a target mrna in which most sequences are inaccessible owing to the secondary or tertiary structures of the rna and or the binding of proteins; and a rnase-p-recognizing sequence that is a portion of the trna sequence and required for interacting with rnase p <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the "3/ <dig> egs" effectively and specifically induces target mrna cleavage by eukaryotic rnase p  <cit> .

phenotype changes have been associated with more than  <dig>  c. elegans genes through a combination of rnai screens, classical mutant screens and systematic gene knockout experiments  <cit> . despite these successes, the functions of most of the approximately  <dig>  predicted genes in the c. elegans genome remain elusive. moreover, there were some clear differences in the results of these rnai screens conducted by different researchers. these differences were considered to result from different approaches and standards in rnai screening. furthermore, there was also  <dig> to 30% variability in the results of the rnai screens conducted by the same researcher according to the same procedure  <cit> . the relative variability of the rnai effect should be an important consideration before the rnai data are used as starting point for new experiments <cit> . in this study, we show that egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in c. elegans, and the egs library can facilitate a reverse genetic screen similar to that possible with an rnai library

RESULTS
validation of egs technology for down-regulating gene expression in c. elegans
there are two types of green fluorescent proteins  in c. elegans strain pd <dig>  ngfp consists of a wild-type gfp and a nuclear-localization signal encoded by ngfp-lacz. mtgfp consists of a wild-type gfp and a mitochondrial-localization signal encoded by mtgfp <cit> . egss that target to ngfp-lacz or mtgfp mrna can be designed using rna-folding software <cit> . according to the rules of egs design <cit> , the favorable accessible regions of ngfp-lacz  and mtgfp mrnas  were identified from all candidate accessible regions. the "3/ <dig> egs"  was used as the framework. the anti-sense sequence of the accessible region was introduced into the antisense domain of the framework. the "cca" sequence <cit>  located in the 3'-terminus is important for the egs effect. to protect the "cca" sequence from being exposed directly to rnase, the "uuu" sequence was attached to its 3'-terminus. two egss, egs-ngfp-lacz  and egs-mtgfp , were constructed. two additional egss, egs-ngfp-lacz-d  and egs-mtgfp-d , were also constructed. egs-ngfp-lacz-d and egs-mtgfp-d were derived from egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, respectively, and contained point mutations  at the three highly conserved positions in the "t-loop" of these egss. these nucleotides have been found in most of the known, natural trna sequences <cit>  and are thought to be important for interactions between the trna domains and human rnase p <cit> . previous studies have shown that egss with these mutations prevented rnase p recognition and showed little activity in directing rnase-p-mediated cleavage <cit> .

to determine the efficacy of the egss in inhibiting the expression of their targets, pd <dig> worms were treated with egs-ngfp-lacz, egs-mtgfp, a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, egs-ngfp-lacz-d, egs-mtgfp-d, or a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz-d and egs-mtgfp-d. in contrast to worms treated with soaking buffer , worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz  or egs-mtgfp  showed a partial reduction in gfp fluorescence. gfp fluorescence almost disappeared in worms treated with a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp . by contrast, there was no decrease in gfp fluorescence in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz-d , egs-mtgfp-d , or a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz-d and egs-mtgfp-d . the disabled egss were able to serve as negative controls that cannot function effectively for rnase p-based targeting.

the expression level of gfp mrna was determined by quantitative pcr  analysis . reductions of 34% and 40% in the expression level of gfp mrna were observed in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, respectively. there was a marked reduction of 96% in the expression level of gfp mrna in worms treated with a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp. by contrast, the expression level of gfp mrnas was reduced by <10% in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz-d, egs-mtgfp-d, or a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz-d and egs-mtgfp-d. these results indicate that these egs-induced significant reductions in the target mrna expression level were due to rnase p-mediated cleavage. the low level of inhibition in worms treated with these disabled egss was presumably due to an anti-sense effect of the egs.

inhibition of the expression of ngfp and mtgfp in pd <dig> worms that were treated with egs, compared with the levels of inhibition in pd <dig> worms that were treated with soaking buffer. the values shown are means derived from triplicate experiments, and values for the standard deviation that were less than 5% are not shown.

to examine the targeting specificity of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, the protein levels of ngfp and mtgfp were determined by western-blot analysis . reductions of  <dig> ± 5% and less than 10% in the levels of ngfp and mtgfp proteins, respectively, were observed in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz. similarly, there were reductions of 70% and less than 10% in the levels of mtgfp and ngfp proteins, respectively, in worms treated with egs-mtgfp. interestingly, greater reductions of  <dig> ± 6% and 95% in the level of ngfp and mtgfp proteins, respectively, were observed in worms treated with a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp. by contrast, ngfp and mtgfp protein levels were reduced by <10% in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz-d, egs-mtgfp-d or a mix of egs-ngfp-lacz-d and egs-mtgfp-d. the small reductions in the ngfp and mtgfp protein expression levels in worms treated with these disabled egss were likely due to anti-sense effects of the egss.

generation of egs library
the "3/ <dig> egs"  was used as a framework for the egs library. the egs library , which contains a randomized anti-sense domain of the "3/ <dig> egs", was generated by introducing the following modifications into the framework: the anti-sense domain was composed of random bases; the "cca" sequence <cit>  located in the 3'-terminus is important for the egs effect. to protect the "cca" sequence from being exposed directly to rnase, the "uuu" sequence was attached to its 3'-terminus. the resulting egs library is a collection that contains any egs targeted to any target mrna .

pet28a-legs, which contains the egs library cassette under control of t <dig> promoter, was constructed . first, a primer pair of flesp and rlegsp was designed . the partially randomized oligonucleotides of flesp and rlegsp were composed of two parts; one acted as a primer to amplify pet28a-d equal to pet28a but lacked the fragment between the t <dig> terminator and t <dig> promoter. the other acted as a primer to amplify the egs library cassette. second, pet28a-legsl was amplified by pcr with the primer pair of flegsp and rlegsp using pet28a as template. third, pet28a-legs was constructed by self-ligation of pet28a-legsl and transformed into dh5α to screen for pet28a-egs clones containing individual egs cassettes.

in general, about 98% of pet28a-egs clones have one hincii site, with the remaining 2% having two or three hincii sites. their hincii digestion patterns were predicted by the nti program . to examine the composition of the egs library,  <dig> clones were chosen at random for restriction enzyme  analysis. of these  <dig> clones, 94%  showed the hincii digestion pattern shown in fig. 7a, lane rv <dig>  the rest  showed the hincii digestion pattern shown in fig. 7a, lane rv <dig>  sequence analysis was performed to determine the specific sequences; 94% were shown to have a unique egs cassette sequence. alignment analysis was used to show that these sequences  showed no bias in cloning of certain egs cassettes.

validation of egs library for reverse genetic screen in c. elegans
to examine whether the egs library can be used as a reverse genetic screen in c. elegans,  <dig> unique egss were randomly selected and used for screening of the c. elegans strain n <dig>  the screening procedure is systemically shown in fig.  <dig>  first, the egs clone ivtt containing an egs cassette controlled by the t <dig> promoter was amplified by pcr with the primers fclone-ivtt and rclone-ivtt, using the pet28a-egs clone as a template . an egs clone was transcribed by t <dig> rna polymerase using the purified egs-clone ivtt as a template . second, synchronous cultures of n <dig> worms were soaked in egs solution. these worms were individually transferred to new plates with food, and phenotypes of both p <dig> worms and f <dig> progenies were recorded . all phenotypes visible under the dissection microscope were recorded. such phenotypes included sterility, slow postembryonic growth, larval arrest, larval lethality, abnormal morphology, and uncoordination. about 6% of egss induced abnormal phenotypes, such as p <dig> slow postembryonic growth, p <dig> larval arrest, p <dig> larval lethality and p <dig> sterility . of these, egs- <dig> and egs- <dig>  caused the greatest phenotype changes . the target mrnas of egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> were identified by the following procedure. all candidate target mrnas of an egs were identified by a blast search of its target sequence . blast searches of all egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> candidate target sequences  produced  <dig> and  <dig> candidate mrnas , respectively. the expression levels of all candidate target mrnas in worms treated with egs- <dig> or egs- <dig> were analyzed by qpcr . in worms treated with egs- <dig>  there were 64% and <10% reductions in the expression levels of zk <dig>  mrna  and the other candidate mrnas, respectively. in worms treated with egs- <dig>  there were reductions of 72% and <10% in the expression levels of lin- <dig> mrna  and the other candidate mrnas, respectively. by contrast, a reduction of <10% in all candidate target mrnas was observed in worms treated with egs-35-d or egs-83-d . these small reductions in worms treated with the disabled egs were likely due to anti-sense effects of the egss. these results indicate that the significant reductions in the levels of target mrna expression  in worms treated with egss were due to egs-directed rnase-p-mediated cleavage. the phenotypes of worms with rnai-zk <dig>  mrna and rnai-lin- <dig> mrna were similar to the phenotypes induced by egs- <dig> and egs- <dig>  respectively .

discussion
it has been shown that egs technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in bacteria  <cit> , mammalian cells  <cit>  and maize cells <cit> . we have shown that egs technology can also be used to down-regulate gene expression in c. elegans. several criteria must be satisfied if successful egs targeting is to be achieved. among these are high cleavage efficiency, egs target specificity, and efficient delivery of the reagent. we constructed egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp that target ngfp-lacz and mtgfp mrnas, respectively, and showed that these egss direct rnase p to cleave the targets efficiently. moreover, we showed targeting specificity of these egss. although the complementary sequence of anti-sense domain of egs-ngfp-lacz is present in mtgfp mrna, a small reduction in the mtgfp protein expression level was observed in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz. in addition, ngfp-lacz mrna contains the complementary sequence of the anti-sense domain of egs-mtgfp, but there was a small reduction in the ngfp protein expression level in worms treated with egs-mtgfp. reduction of <10% in the expression levels of ngfp and mtgfp proteins were observed in worms treated with egs-ngfp-lacz-d or egs-mtgfp-d, respectively. together, these results indicate that the significant reductions in the ngfp and mtgfp protein expression levels in worms that treated with egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp, respectively, were primarily due to egs-induced rnase-p-targeted cleavage rather than anti-sense effects or other nonspecific effects of the egss. the mix of egs-ngfp-lacz and egs-mtgfp had greater effects on inhibition of ngfp-lacz and mtgfp expression compared with individual egs-ngfp-lacz and individual egs-mtgfp, respectively . this was probably due to anti-sense effects of the egss, but is not due to any overlap in the target sequence. maybe the egs methodology is particularly effective when more than one site in a particular mrna is targeted <cit> .

many c. elegans genes have been associated with phenotypes due to the results of reverse genetic screens based on rnai libraries. despite the success of these screens, the functions of most of approximately  <dig>  predicted genes in the c. elegans genome remain elusive. moreover, the limitations of rnai such as off-target  <cit>  and relative variability in the rnai effect <cit>  compromise the level of confidence in the results of these rnai screens. the egs library aims to facilitate reverse genetic screens such as those with the rnai library, and it will be useful for confirming rnai phenotypes. for example, zk <dig>  and lin- <dig> genes were identified by a reverse genetic screen based on the egs library. remarkably, egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> efficiently and specifically interfered with zk <dig>  and lin- <dig>  respectively. the target specificity of the egs is governed by two different types of interactions <cit> . one is the base-pairing interactions <cit>  in which the ten nucleotides in the egs hybridize with the accessible region of the target mrna. the egs has two short, sequence-specific recognition elements that are oriented in space with respect to each other in a well-defined fashion. this complex recognition element provides the necessary specificity for rnase p. it is known that the ten nucleotides involved in base-pairing between the egs and the target mrna make it difficult to guarantee target specificity in c. elegans. given the extensive secondary and tertiary structure associated with the rna or the binding of proteins to the target rna in vivo, the target sequences in cellular rnas are not all accessible. the other type of interaction <cit>  is between the rnase p recognition domain  and the mrna. this interaction facilitates the folding of the egs-mrna complex into a trna-like molecule and stabilizes the mrna-egs complex. an immediate corollary is that if two targets with a one-bp mismatch are compared, the same caveat on accessibility rules out any meaningful comment on specificity of targeting. mutation of a single base in the target mrna will not affect the methodology based on "stem egs" because a single base mismatch in the complex with the target mrna is unlikely to alter recognition by rnase p <cit> . however, the location of the unpaired nucleotides is important because three contiguous unpaired bases might very well disallow the rnase p-mediated effects. it is that an egs could still function despite several point mutations between it and the bacterial target mrna, depending precisely on the sequence of the unpaired bases <cit> . the framework of egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> is the "3/ <dig> egs" that is distinguishable from the "stem egs" by additional parts equivalent to the t-stem and t-loop, and variable regions of a trna. the mismatch tolerance of the effects of egs- <dig> and egs- <dig> needs further study. since the worms are cultured at 20°c, specificity considerations for antisense-based techniques are different compared to plants/animals whose growth temperatures range from  <dig> to 37°c.

CONCLUSIONS
egs technology can be used to interfere with gene expression in c. elegans. the egs library is used to facilitate a reverse genetic screen as performed by a rnai library, and it should be particularly useful for confirming the rnai phenotype as the function of most of the approximately  <dig>  predicted genes in the c. elegans genome remains elusive. moreover, the limitations of rnai such as off-target and relative variability in the rnai effect compromise the level of confidence in the rnai screen results. taken together, these observations are potentially of great importance for further our understanding and promoting the development of c. elegans genomics.
