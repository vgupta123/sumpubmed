BACKGROUND
the increasing demand of monospecific detection reagents, particularly antibodies, for all human gene products is one of the biggest challenges to investigate the protein function and interaction  <cit> . recently, we have demonstrated that phage display selection with our universal human naïve antibody gene libraries hal4/7/ <dig> can dramatically enhance the throughput of antibody generation and currently results in hundreds of new antibody clones per annum  <cit> . these recombinant antibodies have affinities in the low nanomolar range in some cases even in the subnanomolar range without any additional engineering  <cit> . miniaturization and parallelization of panning and screening has been established in microtiter plate scale  <cit>  and moves the bottleneck of the antibody pipeline towards the production and purification of milligram amounts of the individual antibodies in an application compatible recombinant format.

single chain fragment variable  consisting only of the variable  regions of immunoglobulin  light  and heavy  chain connected by a soluble and flexible oligopeptide can be fused to the igg fc moiety. the resulting scfv-fc format has properties of iggs like bivalency, tag-free detection with standard secondary antibody conjugates and fc-mediated effector functions  <cit> . we and others have previously shown that scfv-fc antibodies can be used in all immunoassays including elisa  <cit> , immunoblot  <cit> , antigen and antibody microarray  <cit> , immunohistochemistry  <cit> , immunofluorescence  <cit> , quartz crystal microbalance immunosensors  <cit> , surface plasmon resonance  <cit> , and flow cytometry  <cit> . moreover, scfv-fc antibodies have been successfully used to neutralize viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens in vitro and in vivo  <cit>  which suggests potential use in therapy.

although production of scfv-fc antibodies in yeast pichia pastoris already achieved production levels of 10–30 mg/l  <cit> , and recent developments with glycoengineered yeasts  <cit>  for commercial antibody production  <cit>  and high throughput screening  <cit>  are promising, mammalian cell antibody expression systems are still being advanced regarding production yields and product quality  <cit> . today, almost all therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cells because their advanced folding, secretion and post-translational apparatus is best suited to produce antibodies indistinguishable from those produced in the human body with least concerns for immunogenic modifications. industrial igg production levels in chinese hamster ovary  cells reached about 5 g/l some years ago  <cit>  whereas today titers often exceed 12 g/l as result of a steadily ongoing progress of mammalian cell culture technology which is mainly due to improved high producer cell lines, optimized serum-free production media as well as optimized and prolonged production processes at very high cell densities. the highest igg titer has been reported in the human embryonic retinal cell line per.c <dig>  with 27 g/l in a perfusion bioreactor. although the generation of high producer cell lines has been dramatically improved and accelerated  <cit> , it is still too expensive, time-consuming and laborious for research applications, particularly if large numbers of individual antibodies have to be produced.

here, transient and semi-stable mammalian antibody expression is much more suitable because it allows fast and parallelized production without any need to generate producer cell lines  <cit> . moreover, transient mammalian antibody production can be scaled up by employing batch or fed-batch bioreactor processes to more than  <dig> liter production volumes  <cit> . therefore, transient antibody production is suitable for small scale production for antibody screening  <cit> , but also capable to generate even grams of antibodies  <cit> .

particularly, human embryonic kidney   <dig> cell lines have been used for transient protein expression because they can be very efficiently transfected with plasmid dna. this cell line was generated from embryonal tissue by transformation with sheared adenovirus  <dig> dna. some derivatives were further transformed either with the simian virus  <dig>  large t antigen, termed hek293t, or with the epstein barr virus  nuclear antigen  <dig> , termed hek293e, in order to mediate semi-stable episomal propagation of vectors containing an origin of replication  of sv <dig> or ebv, respectively. transient transfection of plasmid dna in hek <dig> cells can be performed by calcium phosphate transfection  <cit> , cationic liposomes and polymers. the cationic polymer polyethyleneimine  combines highly efficient plasmid delivery with low cytotoxicity and simple handling  <cit> . pei can be used in serum-containing as well as serum-free media  <cit>  and is compatible with upscaling of the production volume  <cit> . the large number of protonable amino groups of pei results in its cationic charge, which is responsible for dna complexation  <cit> . these protonable amino groups also provide high ph buffering capacity which seems to protect the dna from degradation in endosomal compartments and to mediate an early escape of dna/pei complexes from lysosomes probably by the so-called proton sponge effect  <cit> . according to the proton sponge hypothesis, the buffering capacity of pei leads to osmotic swelling and rupture of endosomes, resulting in the release of the complexed dna into the cytoplasm.

in this study, we optimized mammalian expression vectors for single step in frame cloning of scfv fragments from our universal antibody phage display libraries hal4/7/ <dig>  <cit>  into the igg-like scfv-fc format. in combination with transient production using the hek293-6e cell line, a variant genetically modified with a truncated version of ebna <dig> which grows in suspension and chemically defined serum-free medium  <cit> , we achieved volumetric yields of more than  <dig>  g/l for recombinant antibodies as well as for an immunornase fusion protein by simple shake flask cultivation. we demonstrate that transient scfv-fc production in hek293-6e is robust, versatile and highly efficient and can overcome the bottleneck of antibody production in a high throughput in vitro antibody selection pipeline.

RESULTS
construction and test of vectors for transient scfv-fc and immunornase expression in hek <dig> cells
transient expression in hek <dig> cell lines was initially tested with two previously described pcmv vectors encoding either the cd <dig> specific scfv-fc-4e <dig> antibody or the corresponding immunornase , respectively  <cit> . we reproducibly achieved volumetric yields of 14 mg/l for the scfv-fc and 7 mg/l immunornase . transient transfection was performed with pei which allowed very high transfection efficiencies of more than 70% in hek293t cells, as previously described  <cit> . transfection with pei resulted in higher antibody yields than several commercial polymers- or liposome-based transfection reagents, which was attributed to pei’s lower cytotoxicity . the optimal transfection conditions were previously determined with 1 μg dna to 8 μg pei per ml cell culture  <cit> . additional scfv-fc antibodies and immunornase proteins were also tested in the same vector system and reached  <dig> to 6 mg/l in hek293t cells .

in order to facilitate cloning of single chain antibody fragments from phage display antibody gene libraries such as hal4/7/ <dig>  <cit>  into the igg-like scfv-fc format, the new vector pcmv-higg1fc-xp  was generated from the pcmv/myc/er-derived vector pcmv-hc by modifying the 5′ untranslated region, the ribosomal binding site  <cit>  and by introducing a nco/noti compatible multiple cloning site. the original ncoi site at the start codon was removed by transversion from cytidine to adenine at position − <dig> in order to preserve high translation initiation efficiency because it is described as second abundant nucleotide at this position in vertebrate mrnas  <cit> . the residual secretory mouse ig heavy chain signal peptide consisting of two exons and one intron for stabilized expression was retained. following, a new spacer sequence was introduced which is flanked by the new unique ncoi/noti cloning sites allowing single step in frame cloning of scfv antibody fragments from the hal <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> phage display libraries in fusion with the gene fragments encoding aminoterminal mouse ig heavy chain signal peptide and carboxyterminal higg1-fc moiety. all vectors containing this ncoi/noti cloning cassette are designated with “xp”. the pcmv-higg1fc-xp vectors were further optimized at the 3′ stop translation sequences of the fc gene fragment  and tested by transient expression in adherent hek293t cells. the sequence of the original bamhi/xbai cloning site and the upstream opal stop codon was prone to mutations in the stop codon to tta. therefore, we eliminated the bamhi site in direct vicinity of the stop codon and tested the opal stop codon  with one, five or  <dig> downstream nucleotides from the human genomic ig sequence  as well as with one adenine  followed by the xbai site . the adenine as fourth nucleotide is the most frequent in translation termination signals of eukaryotic genes and provides very low read through of the ribosome  <cit> . we also tested the ochre stop codon  followed by one adenine . moreover, we constructed two vectors with an fc gene fragment whose 3′ terminal lysine codon was either deleted  or replaced by a bamhi site reconstituting codons for the two amino acids glycine and serine , respectively . the translation termination sequence of the latter two vectors matched those from vector pcmv <dig> -higg1fc-xp.

transient expression of pcmv <dig> -, pcmv <dig> -, pcmv <dig> -, pcmv <dig> -, pcmv <dig> -, pcmv <dig> - and pcmv <dig> -higg1fc-xp vectors in hek293t cells resulted in a  <dig> - to 3-fold higher average scfv-fc antibody production level than the original pcmv-higg1fc-xp vector depending from the expressed protein . the vector pcmv <dig> - <dig>  and pcmv <dig>  achieved with little exceptions very similar expression levels of 15–35 mg/l fc and scfv-fc proteins when measured 48 h after transfection. we chose pcmv <dig> -higg1fc-xp showing the best average results for further vector development and eliminated the genetic upper hinge region of higg <dig> to avoid unspecific binding of the unpaired cysteine which normally forms the interchain disulfide bond between light and heavy chain in igg <dig> and which is not required in scfv-fc antibodies. the resulting new pcmx <dig> -higg1fc-xp vector  achieved comparable or slightly higher production levels for scfv-fc antibodies in hek293t cells than the corresponding pcmv <dig> -higg1fc-xp vector .

transient expression of standard mammalian expression vectors in hek293-6e cells
first transient expression studies in the hek293-6e cell line  <cit>  were conducted by using mammalian expression vectors pcmv-scfv-higg1fc-4e <dig> and pcmv-scfv-higg1fc-rnase-4e <dig> encoding a cd <dig> specific scfv-fc antibody and the corresponding immunornase fusion protein  <cit> . optimal dna to pei ratio was previously determined with 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> and an optimal plasmid dna concentration of  <dig>  to 1 μg/ml  <cit> . we used standard transfection conditions of 1 μg plasmid dna and  <dig>  μg pei per ml for all further experiments and achieved volumetric yields of  <dig> to 40 mg/l scfv-fc-rnase and  <dig> to 80 mg/l scfv-fc, respectively, already after 3 days of production , and 60–70 mg/l scfv-fc-rnase and  <dig> to 140 mg/l scfv-fc, respectively, after 5 days of production  <cit> . although the volumetric yields in hek293-6e cells were about 10-fold higher than in adherent hek293t, the 5 days product accumulation and the higher cell densities have to be taken into account. transfection efficiencies measured with a fluorescent reporter protein usually varied between 40-50%  <cit> , but we also observed transfection efficiencies of up to 90% which seem to depend on the number of cell passages and the general condition of the cells.

in order to verify that the transfection of cells was completed by pei:dna complexes after 48 hours, an additional experiment was performed where culture supernatant was collected 48 hours post transfection and used in combination with fresh non-transfected cells. no additionally transfected cells were observed in these cultures as measured by flow cytometry .

construction and optimization of vectors for transient expression in hek293-6e cells
since the pcmv or pcmx vector backbones are not compatible to the episomal replication machinery in the hek293-6e cells which express a truncated version of ebna <dig>  vector optimization was done by generating two variants of both vectors, pcmv-scfv-higg1fc-4e <dig>  and pcmv-scfv-higg1fc-rnase-4e <dig> , encoding a cd <dig> specific scfv-fc antibody and the corresponding scfv-fc-rnase variant. first, the complete neomycin phosphotransferase  selection marker expression cassette including its sv <dig> promoter/ori and poly-a signal as well as the f <dig> origin from the vector backbone were eliminated resulting in plasmids pcmv-neo--scfv-fc and -scfv-fc-rnase comprising only  <dig> and 4715 bp , respectively. then, a short version of the ebv orip was introduced into these vectors resulting in the vectors pcmv-orip1-scfv-fc and pcmv-orip1-scfv-fc-rnase with a size of  <dig> and 5705 bp , respectively.

the hek293-6e expression of pcmv, pcmv-neo- and pcmv-orip <dig> containing scfv-fc- and scfv-fc-rnase-4e <dig>  respectively, was done in three independent samples in 25–50 ml scale in shake flasks. after 3 day of production the small pcmv-neo- vector missing the selection marker already resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase of volumetric yields for scfv-fc and scfv-fc-rnase, respectively, compared to the parental pcmv vectors . the pcmv-orip <dig> vectors containing an ebv orip with shortened spacer sequence between fr and ds element even achieved  <dig>  fold higher yields for both constructs compared to the pcmv vectors . production supernatants were harvested and purified by protein a affinity chromatography. the scfv-fc-rnase protein samples were separately purified and achieved recovery rates of about 80% . in contrast, supernatants of triplicate productions of each scfv-fc antibody expression vector were combined prior purification which resulted in a lower recovery rate of about 50% probably due to the lower efficacy of the 1 ml bio-scale mini unosphere supra cartridges  when applying more than 10 mg scfv-fc antibody . nevertheless, transient production of scfv-fc and scfv-fc-rnase using the pcmv-orip <dig> vector resulted in the highest amount purified, followed by the pcmv-neo- vector and the parental pcmv vectors. after transfection, the concentration of viable cells increased from  <dig> × <dig> cells per ml to up to 4× <dig> cells per ml in the following 3 days for the pcmv and pcmv-orip <dig> vectors, whereas pcmv-neo- transfected cells did not exceed  <dig> × <dig> cells per ml . after 3 days of production, viability in samples was  <dig> to 90% . transfection efficiencies tested by co-transfection with a fluorescent reporter plasmid were  <dig> to 90% . in addition, several metabolic parameters were tested in this experiment. the initial glucose concentration of about 3 g/l was almost entirely consumed after 3 days whereas l-lactate concentrations remained at an almost constant level throughout the 3 days production period . l-glutamine  and l-glutamate concentrations were tested after 72 h and found at about  <dig>  and 2 mm, respectively . this early depletion of important nutrients of the cellular energy metabolism combined with the fact that episomal plasmid replication will enable cells for a sustained recombinant protein production suggests that the original protocol provided from bri has a potential for further optimization.

optimization of scfv-fc and immunornase production in hek293-6e cells
in the original protocol and in the initial experiments we have seen that best yields were obtained after at least 5 days production. therefore, the production after transfection with pcmv, pcmv-neo- and pcmv-orip <dig> with scfv-fc- and scfv-fc-rnase-4e <dig> was prolonged . for this purpose, cultures were fed 48 h post transfection with  <dig> % trypton tn <dig> plus one additional volume of fresh f <dig> medium. compared to the 3 days protocol maximum yields increased more than 100% after 6 days for most vector constructs whereas a further extension of production beyond did not result in any significant additional improvement. highest production levels were achieved after 6–7 days for the vector pcmv-orip <dig> with more than 450 mg/l for both scfv-fc-4e <dig>  and scfv-fc-rnase-4e <dig> . for comparison, scfv-fc-4e <dig> and the muc1-specific scfv-fc-ht186-d <dig>  <cit>  expressed by the original vector pcmv yield in about 120 mg/l .

interestingly, yfp expressed by a pcmv-like vector in a parallel sample, was only slightly released into the supernatant after 6 days which can be seen as slight 27 kda protein band in sds-page . however, yfp release into the supernatant increased to  <dig> to more than 350 mg/l after  <dig> to 8 days, respectively, which is associated with the increasing cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic proteins.

in addition to the standard fed of one volume medium and trypton tn <dig> 48 h after transfection, additional supplementation with glucose alone and in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vpa were tested . the fed of glucose together with vpa significantly increased the scfv-fc-rnase production in two of three independent samples, whereas glucose alone did not result in any higher yield in comparison to the standard medium tn <dig> supplementation . interestingly, vpa treatment led to lower cell growth with maximum cell concentration of 4× <dig> cells/ml 6 days after transfection, whereas the other two groups reached 6-8× <dig> cells/ml . from day  <dig> to  <dig> of production, the cell concentration began slightly to decrease in all groups associated with a reduced viability <70% except in the vpa treated group where the viability still remained >90% . after  <dig> to 4 days of production, the ratio of gfp co-transfected cell decreased in all groups indicating that cells stressed by transgene expression were more prone to cell death or lysis than non-transfected cells . a more detailed look into the metabolic parameters  revealed that the standard medium plus tn <dig> fed prevented complete glucose consumption only for 5 days and lactate was also consumed one day later . nevertheless, the product yield still doubled from day  <dig> to  <dig>  additional glucose supplementation delayed complete glucose metabolization within the tested 7 days production period without increasing the protein production . in contrast to glucose, l-glutamine was not completely metabolized during 7 days of production in all groups. additional vpa treatment led to clearly lower glucose and l-glutamine consumption of all groups.

generation of an optimized library compatible scfv-fc vector for hek293-6e expression
in order to obtain an optimal transient mammalian expression vector that comprises all advantages of the previous vectors, a new vector was constructed. first, a minimal backbone of the vector pcmx <dig> -higg1fc-xp was generated. then, the entire antibody gene expression cassette of pcmx <dig> -higg1fc-xp comprising cmv promoter and enhancer, the 5′untranslated region including the modified ribosomal binding site, the gene sequences for the murine immunoglobuline signal peptide including the intron, the spacer containing library compatible multiple cloning sites and the higg <dig> fc moiety were introduced. in a third step, the bgh poly a signal with reduced adjacent spacer sequences, a minimal sv <dig> ori <cit>  and a shortened variant of the ebv orip were introduced. the gene expression cassettes of the cd <dig> specific scfv-fc-4e <dig> antibody and the scfv-fc-rnase-4e <dig> immunornase were introduced in this vector in order to obtain the plasmids pcse-scfv-higg1fc-4e <dig> and pcse-scfv-higg1fc-rnase-4e <dig>  respectively. transient production in hek293-6e was tested by standard supplementation with one volume medium and  <dig> % tn <dig> hydrolysate and achieved volumetric yields of  <dig> to 400 mg/l of scfv-fc-rnase and scfv-fc, respectively, which were similar or even slightly higher than those obtained by the corresponding pcmv-orip <dig> test vectors transfected in parallel samples . highest production levels were obtained after 6 days when the viability of the cells was still >90% . transfection rates were identical for all these vectors .

in order to obtain a universal library compatible vector for the expression of scfv-fc antibodies, the complete transgene expression cassette from pcmx <dig> -higg1fc-xp was inserted into the pcse vector backbone resulting in the vector pcse <dig> -higg1fc-xp .

test of the pcse <dig> -higg1fc-xp vector platform for expressing various scfv-fc antibodies
more than  <dig> scfv gene fragments obtained by phage display from the hal7/ <dig> libraries were subcloned in frame into the fc expression gene cassette of the vector pcse <dig> -higg1fc-xp in order to produce igg-like scfv-higg1fc antibodies. transient production using the standard transfection and production conditions resulted in volumetric yields of  <dig> to 600 mg/l scfv-fc antibodies with an average of about 400 mg/l . the production levels of higg1-fc without scfv even reached up to 900 mg/l. sds-page analyses of production supernatants revealed major protein bands corresponding to scfv-fc antibodies with a molar mass of  <dig> to 60 kda  under reducing conditions. there was only a small amount of additional proteins released by the hek293-6e . protein a affinity purification and desalting were sufficient to obtain all scfv-fc antibodies in very high purify of >98% .

storage of purified scfv-fc antibodies for more than 6 months at 4°c in pbs without protective protein did not reveal any significant proteolytic degradation .

discussion
we previously described an efficient platform for the in vitro generation of recombinant human antibodies by phage display from the universal libraries hal4/7/ <dig>  <cit>  which can address the required throughput even for proteome projects  <cit> . however, the production of milligram amounts of different antibodies for the end-user in an application compatible recombinant format created a new bottleneck in the overall-process. igg-like bivalent scfv-fc antibodies perform well in most immunoassays, but production of more complex antibody formats like scfv-fc requires eukaryotic or even mammalian expression systems to achieve high yields of functional protein and to reduce the efforts during downstream processing  <cit> .

in this study we optimized transient antibody expression in hek <dig> cell lines in order to obtain high yields in combination with simple and robust protocols for production and downstream processing. we started with pcmv standard vectors and transient expression in hek293t cells which already achieved more than 20 mg/l volumetric yields per day. however, laborious handling of these adherent cells, limited scalability, and daily medium exchange prevents this production system from being suitable for production of more than a few antibodies in parallel. in contrast, suspension cell lines allow easier handling, higher cell densities, and better scalability which would facilitate simultaneous production of dozens of antibodies as well as up-scaling to liter volumes in shake flasks or bioreactors.

the hek293-6e cell line was developed to improve transient production of recombinant proteins  <cit>  and used in this study. the first tests performed with the pcmv expression vector without orip already resulted in volumetric yields of more than 140 mg/l scfv-fc and 70 mg/l scfv-fc-rnase after 5 days production which is about 10-fold higher than the expression levels in hek293t. however, specific cellular production levels of hek293t and hek293-6e cells were in a similar range of 5–20 pg per cell per day. therefore, the 5– <dig> fold higher production titers in hek293-6e were mainly due to higher cell densities in suspension culture and the product accumulation over several days. in order to optimize antibody production in the hek293-6e cell line, we generated test vectors without selection marker and with a short variant of ebv orip, respectively. the elimination of the selection marker already resulted in a  <dig> to  <dig> -higher production compared to the original pcmv vector in hek293-6e which is probably due to the small size of the vector, i.e. the higher number of plasmid molecules per transfection, and the absence of any co-expressed selection marker protein. co-expression of a fluorescent reporter protein resulted in an approximately 10-20% lower antibody yield . the introduction of the short orip variant into the expression vector pcmv-neo- led to an additional increase of antibody production levels. the increased stability of plasmids containing the ebv orip by episomal replication and more efficient distribution to the daughter cells during cell division in ebna1+ cell lines is important for prolonged production but it cannot entirely explain the higher expression levels already after 72 hours which reached more than 250 mg/l for an cd <dig> specific scfv-fc antibody and more than 100 mg/l for the corresponding scfv-fc-rnase fusion protein. it was implicated that ebna <dig> binding to orip also increases the nuclear plasmid import and enhances the activity of strong constitutive promoters like the immediate early cmv promoter  <cit> . moreover, binding of ebna <dig> to the family of repeats  domain of orip activates the transcription of downstream ebv genes as well as transgenes  <cit> .

the measurement of metabolic parameters revealed that glucose was almost entirely consumed after 3 days of production. in this case cells start to subsequently remetabolize l-lactate whereas lactate levels remained at a relatively low and constant level if glucose is fed in time. in contrast, l-glutamine was still not completely depleted. however, this is mainly due to the fact that our media were already supplemented with  <dig>  mm of l-glutamine instead of the 4 mm of the original protocol. according to these results, we optimized and prolonged the fed batch shake flask cultivation by a doubling of culture volume by supplementation of medium, glucose and vpa in addition to our standard fed with casein hydrolysate tn <dig>  production titers improved almost twice for both, scfv-fc and scfv-fc-rnase constructs, after supplementation with one volume fresh medium in combination with tn <dig> 48 h after transfection and a prolongation of the production to 7–8 days. additional supplementation of glucose alone, performed 3 days after transfection, did result in just a small increase of the yield suggesting that the lack of glucose is not immediately causing detrimental effects on recombinant protein production as the metabolism of the cells is able to compensate this by using other components . however, glucose supplementation maintained cell viability for at least one more day at a high level, thus minimizing the burden of contaminating, passively released intracellular proteins in the supernatant. in contrast, the combined addition of vpa and glucose 3 days after transfection increased the scfv-fc-rnase production levels about  <dig> to 25%. vpa is known to induce total cellular protein expression like other histone deacetylase inhibitors, e.g. sodium butyrate  <cit> . shake flask experiments supplemented with vpa/glucose had the highest glucose, l-lactate and l-glutamine concentrations remaining after 4–7 days of transient production. this appears to be comprehensible since further cell proliferation is substantially diminished after supplementation with vpa. however, addition of vpa seems to depend on other parameters because not all productions achieved higher antibody yields compared to the standard fed batches. since vpa increases general protein expression  <cit> , it may also alter cell properties, inducing apoptosis and potentially influence product quality. therefore, the addition of vpa was not included into the standard protocol in the further study.

in order to combine all advantages of the previous vectors including compatibility to single step in frame subcloning of single chain antibody fragments from phage display libraries into the scfv-fc antibody format, an entirely new transient mammalian expression vector was generated. the vector backbone was optimized for small size, compatibility to episomal replication in sv <dig> large t antigen or ebna <dig> expressing mammalian cell lines, i.e. hek293t and hek293-6e, without any eukaryotic selection marker and high copy e. coli plasmid ori for efficient plasmid dna preparation. transient expression in hek293-6e cells using these optimized pcse vectors containing the scfv-fc and scfv-fc-rnase expression cassettes resulted in similar or better yields than the corresponding pcmv-orip <dig> test vectors which achieved the highest production yields compared to all previous vectors. moreover, reduced plasmid propagation in e. coli observed for the pcmv-neo- and pcmv-orip <dig> test vectors was overcome by employment of appropriate spacer sequences which separated the e. coli pmb <dig> ori from other dna structure elements like the highly repetitive fr element of ebv orip <dig> or the antibody gene expression cassette. finally, an fc expression cassette containing a ncoi/noti in frame cloning cassette was introduced which allows single step cloning of scfv antibody gene fragments from phage display libraries like hal4/7/ <dig> into the scfv-fc format. more than  <dig> different scfv antibody gene fragments were subcloned into the vector pcse <dig> -higg1fc-xp and achieved average volumetric yields of 400 mg/l by transient production in hek293-6e. some scfv-fc antibodies even exceeded production levels of 600 mg/l which is more than 4-5-fold higher than transient production levels of camelid heavy chain and single domain antibodies fc proteins of  <dig> to 136 mg/l using the vector ptt <dig> in hek293-6e cells  <cit> . crude production supernatants contained more than 80% recombinant scfv-fc antibody which facilitated protein a affinity purification. almost all scfv-fc antibodies were stable for more than half a year storage at 4°c without any protective agent. these scfv-fc antibodies have been used successfully for many different immunoassays including elisa, immunoblot and flow cytometry.

improved production media and fed batch supplementation as well as controlled bioreactor processes may further increase cell densities and prolong production time which can further enhance production levels. backliwal and colleagues  <cit>  combined optimized pei-based transfection at high cell densitities with the co-expression of cell cycle regulators p <dig> and p <dig>  acidic fibroblast growth factor, vpa supplementation, consequent maintenance at high cell densities of 4x <dig> cells/ml and upscaling to 2 l and achieved production levels of more than 1 g igg in two weeks after transfection. however, individual optimization is not suitable for high-throughput production of non-characterized antibodies which requires a simple, robust and efficient protocol as we have shown in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, transient expression in hek293-6e combined with optimized expression vectors and fed batch processes provides robust and versatile production of up to 600 mg/l recombinant igg-like scfv-fc antibodies. this expression system has been proven to be scalable from milliliter to liter volumes already in shake flasks which can address the production bottleneck of high throughput in vitro antibody generation pipelines. moreover, efficient secretory production of more complex igg-like scfv-fc antibodies facilitates downstream processing and increases the compatibility to standard immunoassays and other applications compared to small recombinant antibody fragments. concluding, efficient transient production of scfv-fc antibodies and derivative fusion proteins in hek293-6e provides the bridge from high throughput in vitro antibody generation to application which reduces efforts to obtain recombinant antibodies as highly specific detection reagents to all human proteins and protein variants in a proteome scale as well as to accelerate processes in therapeutic antibody development pipelines.
