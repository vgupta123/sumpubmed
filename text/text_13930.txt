BACKGROUND
micrornas  are endogenous non-coding rnas around  <dig> nucleotides in length. since the initial discovery of mirnas as essential regulators of development in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, thousands of mirnas have been identified in animal and plant genomes . mature mirnas are derived from single-stranded rna transcripts that contain an imperfect stem-loop secondary structure, which forms a hairpin structure that is processed by dicer-like  <dig> into the mirna duplex in the nucleus, and are then transported to the cytoplasm in plants  <cit> . mirnas can complement corresponding target mrnas to induce rna interference, thereby inhibiting mrna translation  <cit> . plant mirnas are involved in a range of activities including responses to adverse environments such as drought, temperature, salt, nutrient starvation, and heavy metal stresses  <cit> , as well as defense responses against pathogen infections  <cit> .

tomato  is one of the most important fruit vegetable crops cultivated worldwide, and is also a model organism in plant scientific research. following the sequencing of its complete genome, it is becoming possible to predict, characterize, and validate mirnas from the tomato   <cit> , yet only ~ <dig> mature tomato mirnas have been reported in the mirbase database to date . some of these mirnas are well characterized; for example, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are linked to nutrient deficiency stress, and mir <dig> is specifically induced in response to phosphate starvation . recently, some putative novel mirnas in small rna  libraries of tomato fruit and leaf tissue were discovered by cloning and sequencing  <cit> . using computational approaches, yin et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> conserved mirnas and their  <dig> potential target genes, while kim et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> conserved mirnas and predicted  <dig> potential target genes. however, a large number of mirnas remain to be discovered, and the functions of most mirnas remain unknown.

abscisic acid  is a major phytohormone that regulates a broad range of plant traits and physiological processes. as a central regulator of stress response in plants, aba triggers major changes in gene expression and physiological responses to adapt to environmental conditions, as well as in the regulation of plant immune responses that protect the plants against pathogens . during these stress-response processes, mirna expression levels also change in response to aba to regulate gene expression. the vital roles of some mirnas in the aba response have been identified in several plants  <cit> . for instance, during seed germination of arabidopsis thaliana, mir <dig> accumulates and regulates myb proto-oncogene  <dig>  and myb <dig> transcription factor expression levels under exogenous aba application and water deficit treatments  <cit> . additionally, mir <dig> targets the nuclear transcription factor y , which plays an important role in drought responses. exposure to aba or abiotic stresses greatly induces a. thaliana nfya <dig> transcripts but leads to decreased levels of mir <dig>  <cit> . moreover, mir <dig> and mir <dig> respond to exogenous aba, and regulate abiotic stress adaptation in oryza sativa  <cit> . these studies demonstrate that some mirnas are involved in the aba response and stress adaptation. in addition, some mirnas such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mirna <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are involved in pathogen defense  <cit> . however, it is unclear if mirnas associated with pathogen defense also respond to aba.

small rna  digitalization analysis based on illumina high-throughput sequencing takes the advantages of a small sample requirement, high throughput and accuracy, and simply operated automatic platform  <cit> . this allows for the comprehensive identification of srnas of particular species under certain conditions, predicting novel mirnas, and constructing srna differential expression profiles between samples. therefore, it is now possible to identify novel and low abundance mirnas using high-throughput sequencing technologies targeting entire genomes  <cit> .

in this study, we carried out comprehensive profiling of tomato leaf mirnas and analyzed them using high-throughput sequencing. in our previous study, we assembled the transcriptome of tomato  in response to exogenous application of aba, and we identified many genes related to pathogen resistance and stress tolerance in response to aba, including transcription factors and pathogen resistant genes  <cit> . here, we identified a number of known and novel mirnas that respond to aba, and predicted their potential targets. moreover, combined with previous comparative transcriptome datasets, we analyzed the expression levels between mirnas and their target genes and discussed the potential mirna functions with respect to tomato biotic and abiotic tolerances. this study presents the global expression analysis of aba-regulated mirnas in tomato, which enriches the tomato mirna database and provides a prospective for investigating mirna function in response to aba, environmental stress, and pathogen resistance.

RESULTS
global mirna profile analysis
we constructed srna libraries from tomato leaves sprayed with water  or aba solution  using the hiseq  <dig> system. after we filtered the low quality and contaminated reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  were generated from the c1d and a1d libraries, respectively. upon removing the adaptor sequences, polya-containing sequences, and sequences shorter than 14 nt, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> genome-matched reads in control  and  <dig> , <dig> genome-matched reads in aba-treated tomato . these represent  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique srna sequences for the control and aba treatment respectively, suggesting that the aba treatment induced the biogenesis of a high number of unique srnas . we then categorized and annotated rna reads into mirnas, transfer rnas, small interfering rnas, small nucleolar rnas, ribosomal rnas, repeat regions, and exon and intron rna based on genomic location and function analysis.table  <dig> the distribution of various small rna types in control and aba-treated tomato plants



the length of these srna ranged from  <dig> to 30 nt, with the  <dig> and 24 nt srna classes as the most abundant groups in both libraries, occupying  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total in the control, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total in aba treatment . this was similar to previous reports in tomato and arabidopsis . furthermore, we analyzed the base bias of mirna, and found that the first base from the 5′ end has a strong preference of uridine  in both control and aba treatment datasets. this important feature of mirnas  <cit>  was not altered by the aba treatment.fig.  <dig> distribution of small rnas with different nucleotide lengths in the control  and aba-treated  tomato plants



we then compared the mirna profiles between the control and aba treatment. mirnas occupied a small portion of the total srnas, and their numbers were reduced by aba treatment, suggesting that aba may repress mirna biogenesis . the total reads of mirna fell from  <dig> , <dig>  in c1d to  <dig> , <dig>  in a1d, and the unique mirna tags reduced from  <dig>   in c1d to  <dig>   in a1d. furthermore, the 21 nt srnas mainly composed of mirnas, decreased following aba treatment. these results indicate that aba diminished mirna composition and abundance on the whole. moreover, the abundance of 24 nt srnas increased in the a1d compared to c1d, indicating that more 24 nt srnas were produced in response to aba. this was in agreement with the report on heat-responsive mirnas of populus tomentosa  <cit> . the 24 nt srnas normally belong to sirna  <cit> , and they may have specific functions in aba response that requires further investigation. in addition, a total un-annotated reads of  <dig> , <dig>   in a1d and  <dig> , <dig>   in c1d were acquired for further predicting novel mirnas .

mirna identification and target gene prediction
the previously identified mirnas are referred to known mirnas. we searched for known mirnas in the two srna libraries by comparing them with data from tomato and other plant species in mirbase  <dig>  . after filtering out known mirnas, we predicted unidentified mirnas, referred to as novel mirnas, using the un-annotated sequence reads in c1d and a1d libraries by mireap . a mirna precursor has a characteristic stem-loop hairpin secondary structure, which is one of most important feature that separates mirnas from other endogenous small rnas  <cit> . in total,  <dig> mirnas were identified, including  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas . additional file 1: table s <dig> listed eight novel mirnas, which were recently named according to updated mirnaase  <dig>  database. however, these newly updated mirna did not affect analysis of the study. the predicted precursor sequences for novel mirnas preferentially in the secondary structure were listed in additional file . the results indicated that high-throughput rna-sequencing technology is a powerful technique for large-scale analysis of mirna expression and identification of novel mirnas.

among known mirnas, five members including sly-mir <dig>  mir167a, mir168a, mir166g-3p, and sly-mir <dig>  showed high abundance with > <dig> standardized reads . in general, ancient mirnas are more highly conserved and abundant in terrestrial plants  <cit> . four mirnas, sly-mir <dig>  mir172a, sly-mir <dig> and mir <dig>  exhibited level with 1000– <dig> tpm. furthermore,  <dig> known mirnas were expressed at 100– <dig> tpm,  <dig> mirnas at 10– <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas at 2– <dig>  leaving  <dig> mirnas expressed below two tpm.

as compared with known mirnas, the novel mirnas displayed lower expression levels . only four  had high abundance at 1000– <dig> tpm. in addition, we also identified six novel mirnas with expression level at 100– <dig> tpm,  <dig> mirnas at 10– <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas at 2– <dig>  the results suggested that newly identified mirnas were generally expressed at lower levels, which is in agreement with the previous report in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . overall, the finding of novel mirnas in tomato has provided enriched insight into the plant mirna dataset. however, the functions of these novel mirnas need to be further demonstrated.

target prediction of mirna led to the identification of the genes regulated by those mirnas. in our analysis, we identified  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas with predicted target genes. most of those mirnas were shown to have multiple target genes, which are consistent with other reports  <cit> . for instance, mir6024-3p, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  sly-mir <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> predicted target genes, respectively. the results indicated that the single mirna might participate in multiple signal pathways and possess wide-ranging functions in tomato. overall, the number of predicted target genes of known mirnas was much greater than that of novel mirnas. reportedly, conserved mirnas contained more target genes  <cit> . our results also support the previous finding that evolutionarily conserved mirnas exert more functions in vivo  <cit> .

exogenous aba regulates tomato mirna expression
to evaluate the regulatory roles of aba on mirna expressions, we compared the differential expression profiles of mirnas between the control and aba-treatment. to minimize noise and improve accuracy, the mirnas that had tpm value less than two were removed, leaving  <dig> mirnas for further differential expression analysis. changes in the expression level of at least |log2fold-change | ≥ <dig>  were recognized as a response to aba treatment . accordingly, a total of  <dig> mirnas exhibited differential expression in response to exogenous application of aba, including  <dig>  strongly altered mirnas with |log2fc|≥ <dig> and p < <dig> , and  <dig>  slightly altered with 1>|log2fc|≥ <dig> . in addition,  <dig> mirnas did not displayed change in expression levels with |log2fc|< <dig> .fig.  <dig> differential expression analysis of mirnas between the control  and aba-treatment  libraries. the mirnas with expression level ≥ <dig> tpm were listed . mirnas that satisfied the criteria “|log2fc| ≥1” and p < <dig>  were considered as “significantly up-regulated” or “significantly down-regulated”. mirnas that differed by 1>|log2fc|≥ <dig>  were assigned to “slightly up-regulated” or “slightly down-regulated”. mirnas that did not fall into either of the above-mentioned categories were characterized as “unobviously regulated”



after removing the mirnas with |log2fc| < <dig> ,  <dig> mirnas  were left for further expression analysis. among them,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel candidates were only detected in the control, while  <dig> known and  <dig> novel ones were seen only in aba-treatment, indicating that aba completely inhibited or induced expression of these mirnas in aba-treatment. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> completely inhibited and  <dig> induced mirnas with over ten tpm. among the other mirnas shared between the two libraries,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas exhibited differential expressions. the shared mirnas with over ten tpm presented  <dig> down-regulated mirnas and  <dig> up-regulated mirnas, as shown in fig. 4a and b. in these highly expressed mirnas, not only the number but also the expression abundance of the down-regulated mirnas were much more than that of the up-regulated. we analyzed the corresponding transcriptome data and identified that the expression level of the mirna target genes were generally increased upon treatment with aba , indicating mirnas negatively regulated target gene expressions. for example, mir6024-3p, showed a fall in expressed counts from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm following the aba treatment, and was predicted to act on  <dig> genes corresponding to  <dig> transcripts in our aba-responsive transcriptome. the expressions of these transcripts exhibited that  <dig> members were elevated, ten were reduced and  <dig> were unaltered  <cit> . the results demonstrate that mirnas responded to exogenous application of aba, and induced changes in gene expression regulation.fig.  <dig> the mirnas completely repressed or induced by aba treatment. graph contains mirnas that were completely repressed or induced upon aba-treatment, and had a minimum tpm of ten. blue denotes mirnas expressed in control plants, and red denotes mirnas expressed in the aba-treated plants

fig.  <dig> comparison of expression levels in mirnas that were shared between the control  and aba  treated tomato plants. the mirnas that differed by |log2fc| ≥ <dig>  were shown. graph contains  the differentially expressed known mirnas, and  novel mirnas. for both panels, mirnas that had a minimum tpm value of ten in one library are listed



we also conducted a function analysis of target genes of the mirnas, and found that the differentially expressed mirnas were involved in condition stress and pathogen resistance, growth and development. here, we highlight those mirnas that target transcription factors and defense related genes .

the mirnas that target transcription factors
transcription factors  interact with cis-elements of responsive gene promoter regions, controlling the expression of many downstream genes, and triggering cascade reactions of many physiological processes and biochemical reactions in plant cells  <cit> . a large number of tfs respond to aba treatment in plant  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> mirnas that have one or more predicted targets that are transcription factors. among them,  <dig> aba-responsive mirnas with differential expression were identified, containing eight up-regulated mirnas , and four down-regulated mirnas . these mirnas are likely to target dozens of genes involving in condition stresses and defense responses, as well as growth and development. here, our results mainly analyzed the mirnas which their targets are the transcription factors such as myb , ap2/erebp , bhlh , bzip , nac , and mads-box families .table  <dig> list of selected mirnas associated with target genes that are transcription factors and disease resistance proteins


a these nbs-lrr genes are included in the  <dig> nbs-lrrs targeted by mir6024-3p


rlk receptor-like kinase, stk serine/threonine-protein kinase, nac no apical meristem/ataf/cup-shaped cotyledons, nbs-lrr nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat, myb myb proto-oncogene protein, bzip basic leucine zipper, erf ethylene-responsive transcription factor, ap2/erebp apetala 2/ethylene-responsive element-binding factor, map mitogen-activated protein



the myb family, the largest plant transcription factor family, plays important roles in plant stress tolerance  <cit> . target gene prediction showed that three mirnas with differential expression may target ten myb genes, containing two down-regulated mirnas  and one up-regulated mirna . furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the tomato genome for the target myb genes, and statistical analysis for their corresponding transcripts, and observed that they act on different target gene members and correspond to multiple transcripts. the mir <dig> was predicted to target three myb genes corresponding to four transcripts in the aba-responsive transcriptome dataset, and the analysis of expression indicated that there were two up- and one down- regulated, and one unchanged myb genes in the transcriptome. the sly-mir <dig> was predicted to target five mybs with  <dig> transcripts, where seven were up-regulated and three were down-regulated in the transcriptome . in addition, the up-regulated novel_mir_ <dig> targets on two mybs, and one decreased and the other had no change  <cit>  .

the functions of myb have been investigated in many plant species such as arabidopsis, maize , cotton , rice , petunia  and apple   <cit> , and have been shown to act on biotic and abiotic stress, phenylpropanoid metabolism, differentiation, cell shape, formation of b-type cyclin, hormone responses . in general, the expressions of these mirnas were reduced upon aba-treatment, and the target myb genes elevated when exposed to exogenous aba . interestingly, up-regulated myb is beneficial to improve plant stress tolerances  <cit> .

we next conducted similar analysis for other mirnas. two bzip genes were targeted by mir7997a, mir7997c and mir <dig>  interestingly, mir7997a and mir7997c target the same bzip, but their abundance changes were completely opposite. mir7997a was repressed from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm and mir7997c was induced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  upon aba treatment. their target bzip corresponded to three transcripts, with two increased and one no change in the aba-responsive transcriptome. it probably resulted from the two mirnas functioning together. in addition, three transcripts, deriving from another bzip gene acted by the down-regulated mir <dig>  showed that two were increased and one was unaltered. besides, mir <dig> was also predicted to act on a bhlh, but did not show any expression difference in our transcriptome dataset. mir165a-3p was predicted to target another bhlh whose expression was not detected.

the mir172a and mir <dig> were predicted to act on several ap <dig>  transcription factors and two erf  family genes. these are tfs belong to ap2/erebp transcription factors family that exert crucial roles not only in adverse stress but also in pathogen resistance. ap2/erebp can interact with dres  as a trans-acting factor, triggering downstream gene expression changes to improve stress tolerance in plant  <cit> . they are also involved in ethylene signaling pathway that is linked to biotic stress responses, protecting plant against pathogen attacks  <cit> . mir172a, down-regulated from  <dig>  tpm in c1d to  <dig>  in a1d by aba, was predicted target eight ap2/erebp genes, corresponding to  <dig> transcripts. of these transcripts, five showed increased and one showed decreased expression, while the other eight had no obvious change in expression levels. all of them were annotated as pathogenesis-related transcriptional factor, indicating that mir172a plays important roles in pathogen resistance. additionally, two erf <dig> genes that were targeted by mir <dig> were not detected in the transcriptome data.

nac proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors that play a crucial role in plant development and in abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> . here, one nac gene, no apical meristem  protein, was targeted by mir6024-3p, and showed no change at transcript level.

the novel_mir_ <dig> was predicted to act on a mads-box transcription factor one . type i mads-box proteins are required for plant reproduction, particularly in specifying female gametophyte, embryo, and endosperm development  <cit> . although novel_mir_ <dig> showed an elevated expression from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm, we did not detect any change in expression levels in the transcriptome.

ap2/erfbp, bzip, bhlh, myb and nac family genes involve in multiple biotic and abiotic stress responses, activating downstream stress responsive genes to improve plant stress resistance  <cit> . overall, the expression level of most mirnas related to above stress-inducible transcription factors were diminished upon exogenous aba treatment, while their targets were generally up-regulated. in general, the aba-induced genes were enriched for those encoding proteins involved in stress tolerance  <cit> .

the mirnas that target pathogen defense genes
biotic stresses, including fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens, are a major constraint to crop production  <cit> . the phytohormone aba plays multifaceted and crucial roles in plant pathogen resistance. in this study, we identified mirnas which target nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat , ap2/erebp, serine/threonine-protein kinase , jasmonate zim-domain protein genes, and globally analyzed the mirnas and their target genes. in total, we identified  <dig> mirnas involved in regulating the expression of disease resistance genes that respond to exogenous aba . among them, 14 were known mirnas with ≥2 tpm in one sample, and these were selected for target gene analysis. the results showed that most of these mirnas were down-regulated by aba .

to date, the majority of known plant disease-resistance proteins contain nbs-lrr. nbs-lrr resistance proteins directly or indirectly recognize pathogen avirulence factors, triggering signal transduction cascades that lead to rapid defense responses, hypersensitive reactions, and programmed cell death . here, we predicted that seven mirnas act on nbs-lrr gene members, such as mir6024-3p, mir482a, sly-mir482a, sly-mir482c, and mir <dig>  mir6026-3p and novel_mir_ <dig> 

the mir6024-3p was predicted to target  <dig> members of nbs-lrr resistance genes. interestingly, these  <dig> members included all the nbs-lrr targets of mir482a , sly-mir482a , sly-mir482c , and mir6026-3p . analysis of mir6024-3p showed a decrease in expression from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm following aba treatment, although the abundance of other four mirnas were elevated from  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm. these four mirnas were predicted to act together with mir6024-3p, and most of their target nbs-lrr showed an increased expression. in the predicted  <dig> members of nbs-lrr resistance genes,  <dig> transcripts were elevated and one was decreased after aba treatment, and  <dig> exhibited less obvious changes . a novel mirna, novel_mir_ <dig> , was predicted to target six members of nbs-lrrs, where two were elevated, three were unaltered and the other was not detected. in addition, the target of mir <dig> was not detected in the transcriptomes.

globally, the results indicated the mirna that were more abundant had larger influence on target gene expression. admittedly, the appearance of the expression levels did not completely conform to the negative correlation between a mirna and the target gene, but the overall trend was in accordance to this hypothesis. this could be explained by the regulatory complexity of mirnas, which often have one or more targets, and a gene can also be targeted by multiple mirnas.

serine/threonine protein kinase  family genes not only play crucial roles in adaption of abiotic stresses but also in pathogen defense in plant  <cit> . here, we predicted four differentially expressed mirnas that target stk genes, including mir <dig>  mir6024-3p, mir4376a-3p and mir319b . a stk gene was predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  and was down-regulated from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm. and the target gene had three transcripts in the transcriptome, with two that were increased in expression and one remained unchanged. mir4376a-3p was down-regulated from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm under aba treatment, and was predicted to target seven genes. one of its targets is a mitogen-activated protein  kinase gene, which belongs to stk family. we compared the related transcriptome data and found one transcript that showed increased expression. map kinase is involved in the sphingolipid elicitor-dependent defense signaling pathway, which acts downstream of the heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunit and small gtpase rac <dig>  and may regulate the expression of various genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

moreover, the receptor-like kinase , which also belongs to stk family, is implicated in plant pathogen interaction and defense responses  <cit> . the targets of mir6024-3p comprise two rlk genes, and both showed an increase in expression in the transcriptome upon aba treatment. however, the novel mirna novel_mir_ <dig> was up-regulated  upon aba treatment, and was predicted to target rlk, which showed one transcript with increased expression and one without change in expression level. in addition, mir319b  also targets a rlk gene, but the target gene transcript was not detected in the transcriptome. generally, the expressions of the mirnas described here were reduced by exogenous aba application, and their targets of stk were elevated .

with respect to jasmonic acid signal transduction pathway, a jasmonate zim-domain protein  <dig> encoding gene was identified as a target of mir <dig>  this protein, a repressor of jasmonate, is negatively regulated by the proteasome in an scf  e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase complex-dependent manner  <cit> . the expression level of mir <dig> decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tpm, but the target transcript was not detected .

ap2/erebp family regulation is usually involved in biotic stress responses, such as pathogen attack and jasmonate and ethylene pathways  <cit> . here, we identified two known mirnas that target ap2/erebp, mir172a and mir <dig>  which were predicted to target eight and one ap2/erebp genes respectively . the expressions of these mirnas and their targets were analyzed as described above.

taken together, the mirnas related to disease resistance showed a tendency to be down-regulated by aba treatment, and the target disease resistance genes were mainly up-regulated in the transcriptome of aba treated plants. reportedly, aba was considered to have multifaceted role in plant resistance to both biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi and bacteria  <cit> . our results suggested that aba improves broad-spectrum pathogen resistance in tomato, as supported by the years-field trials . however, the underlying mechanism of pathogen resistance induced by aba in plants remains to be fully explored.

a mirna usually targets multiple genes, which possibly exert roles in different development stages and stresses, playing various functions. likewise, some genes also are targeted by one or more mirnas. accordingly, a mirna probably is in the presence of functional overlap in biotic and abiotic stress, such as mir6024a-3p, mir172a, mir <dig>  implying that a complex crosstalk between the global regulation of mirna metabolism and aba signaling functions enables the fine-tuning of stress response in plants  <cit> .

quantitative real-time-pcr validation of differentially expressed mirnas from rna-seq
to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of our illumina rna-seq results,  <dig> mirnas were chosen for stem-loop quantitative real-time  pcr. the primer sequences were designed according to each mirna sequence . the expressions of selected  <dig> mirnas were calculated using q-pcr. twenty-three out of  <dig> mirnas exhibited expression in the same trend with that from the sequence analysis, accounting for  <dig>  %, suggesting that rna-seq data were reliable .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used genome-wide mirna profiling to identify multiple mirnas that responded to exogenous aba treatment in the tomato. exogenous aba application was shown to down-regulate many mirnas involved in stress tolerance and pathogen resistance, including those targeting genes encoding transcription factors and disease resistance proteins. in general, mirna expression level changes were negatively correlated with the expression of their target genes. aba may increase expression of stress-related genes by mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation. our results indicate that aba treatment has the potential to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also pathogen resistance in plants by adjusting the expression of mirnas and their target genes.
