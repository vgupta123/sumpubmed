BACKGROUND
assessing the metabolic potential of microorganisms in variable ecosystems is a novel and stimulating challenge in biology. microorganisms are present in all environmental habitats, even the most extreme, yet despite their ubiquity, we know relatively little about these communities. microorganisms display vast diversity, each one having its own set of genes, cell components and metabolic reactions  <cit> . thus  <dig> g of soil may contain up to  <dig> bacteria cells, which may represent between  <dig>  and  <dig>  different species  <cit> . assuming  <dig>  genes per single bacteria genome, there will thus be up to  <dig> ×  <dig> genes mediating huge and various biological processes  <cit> . to overcome the limits of cultivation, several high throughput approaches have been developed to explore genetic contents, such as metagenomics or dna microarrays  <cit> . numerous random shotgun metagenomic projects have caused the publicly available sequence data to increase exponentially, giving us a basis to study complex ecosystems  <cit> . in some cases, these sequence data were used to identify different species in environmental or clinical samples with dna microarrays  <cit> . moreover, these data should improve our knowledge not only of genome organization and genome evolution but also of biological processes and biological activities. however, although such sequencing approaches can rapidly generate large amounts of data, they give only a snapshot of genetic information and can be laborious and costly when complex ecosystems are to be studied. also, dna sequencing is not informative on gene expression and regulation. metatranscriptomic studies are promising, but several obstacles have to be crossed before they can be widely used  <cit> . indeed, sequencing approaches highlight the difficulties of accurate functional annotation of unknown proteins without experimental data; unsupervised annotation of proteins by software pipelines suffers from very high error rates. spurious functional assignments are usually caused by species homology-based transfer of information from existing database entries to new target sequences  <cit> . such functional annotation errors are due to local similarities between the query and functionally annotated sequences. hence, two protein sequences may have two different biological functions, but a same protein domain. this approach, based on homologous gene prediction, presents another major drawback: it can fail to identify novel enzymes that have the same function, but a different primary structure from known enzymes  <cit> . today, the main sources for such protein sequence data are swiss-prot, trembl and genpept. this last should be considered as an equivalent to the swiss-prot/trembl databases with a high level of redundancy in terms of protein sequences  <cit> . unlike trembl, the swiss-prot database contains curated datasets of high quality  <cit> .

another high throughput tool, functional dna microarrays, can also be used for monitoring metabolic diversity of microbial populations in environmental samples. in a single experiment, thousands of genes can be simultaneously detected. several studies already demonstrate the usefulness of functional dna microarrays for exploring various ecosystems  <cit> . hybridization of microarrays with mrna targets permits low-cost, easy quantitative estimates of gene expression levels  <cit> . monitoring environmental metabolic processes can be made more powerful, and so more useful, by designing explorative probes to ensure the detection of genes not already discovered and deposited in databases. however, microarray probe design software determines specific probes to monitor only known sequences  <cit> . thus only a small fraction of genes encoding microbial enzymes can be studied with these probes. to solve this problem, degenerate probes need to be defined, as for pcr-based applications  <cit> .

probe design also has to allow for the constraints of cross-hybridization. specificity is a measure of the inability of a probe to bind strongly to non-target sequences that may be present in a biological sample. this can be accomplished by avoiding probes with excessive sequence similarity to a non-target sequence that may be present during the hybridization  <cit> . these problems of cross-hybridization emphasize the need to take into account the fact that the studies are conducted on complex environments. as thermodynamic constraints are not yet completely understood  <cit> , sequence similarity is currently the prime parameter used to check probe specificity. a previously reported and extensively cited work by kane and coworkers  <cit>  on 50-mer probes, shows that a probe must meet two conditions to be specific:  the oligonucleotide sequence must have no more than 75% similarity  with a non-targeted sequence present in the hybridization pool, and  the oligonucleotide sequence must not include a stretch of identical sequence longer than  <dig> contiguous bases.

here we describe a new algorithm, implemented in a user-friendly program, named metabolic design, which will generate efficient explorative probes using a simple convenient graphical interface. the practical utility of this approach was demonstrated by studying several genes encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the model strain sphingomonas paucimobilis sp. epa <dig>  and assessing metabolic capacities of microbial communities in a soil contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons.

RESULTS
the metabolic design software
our aim is to build a graphical display of given biological processes and perform exhaustive sequence mining of all available protein sequences for each biological step studied. the graphical user interface  allows for example the graphical reconstruction of tailor-made metabolic pathways, with metabolites and enzymes represented respectively with nodes and edges . using appropriate keywords, correctly annotated protein sequences are extracted from a curated database  for each edge of the graph. the user can freely select the most suitable protein as a reference sequence query. this sequence is then used to carry out exhaustive mining of similar proteins from public and/or personal databases. the strategy of probe design using metabolic design software is described in figure  <dig> and detailed in methods under 'software implementation'.

in our study, reference sequences are extracted from the highly curated database swiss-prot formatted for the application to ensure efficient mining. in addition, the reference database is enriched with trembl protein sequences biologically validated when a non-studied orthologous protein sequence was found in the swiss-prot database. for every listed protein, data are extracted using a homologous approach with a blastp program against concatenated swiss-prot and trembl databases. thus the selection of candidate protein sequences based on similarity criteria bypasses functional annotation errors. extracted sequences are then automatically filtered and displayed in graphical edges for each studied enzyme. the results are finally organized according to increasing expected value, or organism origin, and miscellaneous functions are also implemented in the toolbar to facilitate additional data extraction and visualization .

this multiple alignment is then used to design specific explorative oligonucleotide probes targeting studied proteins , using the following procedure. to reduce insertion-deletion  regions in multiple alignments, a first filtering step is carried out to exclude sequences with high size divergence compared with the reference query. a degenerate nucleic consensus sequence based on the iupac  nomenclature is defined from the protein multiple alignment using the backtranslation approach  <cit> . for each molecular site, potential amino acids are backtranslated taking into account all genetic code redundancy . probes are then extracted from this consensus sequence, according to three defined user parameters: probe size, degeneracy and inosine composition thresholds. along the consensus sequence, the algorithm extracts all probes by incrementing the constant defined probe size in a window. all probes with degeneracy and inosine composition under the set thresholds are then listed in an inner window in the gui. thus the user can select all or some pre-selected potential probes for specificity testing. to reduce computing time, during this test the algorithm generates all peptide combinations for each degenerate probe. thus the degeneracy code redundancy is bypassed and the number of comparisons is greatly reduced. this test is carried out using tblastn against the 'cross-hybridization database' using kane's algorithm criteria  <cit> . indeed, those parameters are used to check all positive results by comparison at the nucleotide level with blastn. if those criteria are in agreement with a potential cross-hybridization this may also reflect hybridization with a member of the targeted enzyme family. to avoid this bias, the algorithm extracts the complete sequence of the gene harboring the potential cross-hybridization region and compares it with the reference protein using the blastx program. finally, a file containing all potential cross-hybridizations for every candidate probe is automatically clustered, created and displayed.

data mining and probe selection for microarray experiments using metabolic design
to validate our probe design strategy, we focus on metabolic pathways involved in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . pahs are a class of fused-ring aromatic compounds that are ubiquitous environmental pollutants known to be toxic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. many researchers have therefore focused on the biodegradation of these pollutants by microorganisms, especially bacteria. several enzymes involved in these critical biodegradation steps have been characterized and their sequences deposited in databases  <cit> .

in this study, we choose to target eight genes   known to be involved in the degradation of several pahs  and fluoranthene ). using our defined data mining strategy, we first construct the metabolic pathway with respective substrates and products of each metabolic step. secondly, for each of these metabolic steps, one reference enzyme is extracted from our curated database . homologous proteins are then retrieved from complete databases . based on defined expected threshold values, different sequences are selected  and multiple alignments are then performed to ensure probe design step.

organism name and source, accession number and bibliographic reference for each reference protein. blastp expected threshold values used and selected sequences for multiple alignments for the probe design are given.

to improve our probe design, we have applied two different strategies, using the same multiple alignments. in these strategies, we set the probe length at 24-mer, representing the best compromise between probe specificity and sensitivity criteria  <cit> . in the first strategy, , we have determined a first set of probes for each targeted enzyme. however, owing to high percentages of inosine, these probes generally show a high degree of total degeneracy. indeed, like the inosine residues are not taken into account for the degeneracy threshold determination, probes may present a maximum total degeneracy of  <dig> . to reduce the number of potential specific probes derived from each degenerate defined probe, a second strategy with more stringent parameters is applied . using these parameters, we have found another set of probes for each targeted enzyme. we then choose among the two probe sets obtained with these two strategies, the best probes based on several sequentially evaluated criteria:  the total number of potential cross-hybridizations to decrease possibilities of non-homologous hybridizations,  the probe total degeneracy  to restrict the number of specific probes in the microarray, and  the position of each probe in the reference sequence to target different regions for each enzyme. also, to reduce the number of specific probes synthesized on the microarray, the last nucleotide of each probe  is also manually eliminated.

thus by these strategies, two degenerate probes targeting two different regions are selected per targeted gene . based on these sixteen 23-mer degenerate probes, we finally obtain  <dig>  specific probes.

total number of specific probes from the probe degenerate sequence and relative positions on the reference gene sequence for each targeted gene are described._numbers of unique dna sequences, coding for studied enzymes are also given to highlight that our probes target known genes but also unknown ones. nomenclature: m: a and c; r: a and g; w: a and t; s: g and c; y: c and t; h: a, c and t; d: a, g and t; b: g, t and c; i: a, c, g and t.

explorative probe validation
strain epa <dig> is known to utilize phe and fla as sole sources of carbon and energy for growth  <cit> . however, for this strain, the enzymes involved in the catabolism of phe and fla have not been fully characterized. only gene fragments for the ferredoxin component of dioxygenase  and for the  <dig> -dihydroxy-biphenyl- <dig> -diol  <dig> -dioxygenase  are available in public databases  <cit>  for the studied enzymes. this strain is thus an excellent model to validate our approach, as we could work with no prior assumptions using explorative probes to ensure the detection of unidentified genes.

with this aim, growth kinetics experiments with phe, fla and a mix of both pollutants as sole carbon and energy source are carried out to evaluate the targeted gene expression. as expected, for the eight genes studied, we have detected positive hybridizations  on the dna microarray using mrna as targets extracted after  <dig> h of culture . surprisingly, we do not observe positive signals with the probes targeting one region of the phna2a gene. however, one probe targeting the second region of this gene allow the detection of strong hybridization signals  indicating a potentially high level of gene expression induced by pahs. additionally, control experiments with glucose as sole carbon and energy source do not give positive hybridizations for most of the targeted genes . the snr' value indicating positive hybridization is close to the threshold reflecting a low gene expression. these results suggest that all the studied genes can be induced in response to the mix of pah exposure. the same results are obtained for growth kinetics with one pah  as sole carbon and energy source. the same specific probes give the highest snr' for the eight targeted genes, but with different levels of induction. for example, for the same specific probe  targeting the region b of the gene bpha <dig> in all pah-cultures we find:  <dig>  

 ±

   <dig>  with a mixture of two pollutants,  <dig>  

 ±

   <dig>  with phe alone,  <dig>  

 ±

   <dig>  with fla alone and no positive signal with glucose. we note that the number of probes giving a positive signal is low for targeted genes  reflecting variable levels of similarity between targets and probes deduced from variably degenerate regions.

based on these results, we can also predict the most likely gene sequence of the targets interacting with probes. among the positive probes, one shows a strong signal  compared with the others targeting the same region. we hypothesize that the strongest snr' probe perfectly matched, or is the closest sequence to targeted genes. using sequences of bpha <dig> and bphc genes available in databases , we demonstrate that only two probes among the four have identical sequences with bphc and bpha <dig> genes. these data do not confirm the efficiency of our approach, and so to validate our first observations, we decide to isolate and characterize these genes and the others by a combination of amplification, cloning and sequencing strategies. four gene clusters of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb, respectively  are thereby obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence of the  <dig>  kb contig  shows six putative non-overlapping open reading frames . among these, four are targeted with our microarray probes. the first encodes a polypeptide 98% similar to a putative biphenyl- <dig> -diol  <dig> -dioxygenase known to degrade various dihydroxy-pahs, and named bphc . the second encodes a polypeptide 90% similar to a putative ferredoxin component of dioxygenase, named bpha <dig> , involved in various steps of the process of pah degradation for the electron transfer from reductase to dioxygenase complex  <cit> . interestingly, these two orfs are highly similar to available sequences for strain epa <dig>  <cit> , but a comparison with our sequences reveals some mismatches. the two last genes encode two polypeptides respectively 88% and 95% similar to ahda2c  and ahda1c , two components of a terminal oxygenase involved in the monooxygenation of salicylate, a metabolic intermediate of phe, to catechol  <cit> . two genes identified on the  <dig>  kb contig  encode polypeptides of  <dig> and  <dig> residues. these polypeptides resemble in length and sequence the alpha  and beta  subunits  of the ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase  of sphingomonas sp. chy- <dig>  involved in the conversion of several pahs into their corresponding dihydrodiols  <cit> . the third contig of  <dig>  kb  encompasses a single partial orf encoding a polypeptide displaying 95% similarity with the ferredoxin reductase component of a dioxygenase, named ahda <dig>  of sphingobium sp. p <dig> and involved in the electron transfer in association with bpha <dig>  <cit> . the last contig of  <dig>  kb  encodes a partial  <dig> amino acid sequence 97% similar to a  <dig> -dihydrodiol- <dig> -dihydroxy-dehydrogenase named bphb  of sphingobium yanoikuyae b <dig> 

comparison of these gene sequences with the microarray probes shows that our design strategy is efficient to detect, with no prior sequence assumptions, targeted genes from complete metabolic pathways. as expected, for each gene, different probes give positive signals in agreement with the gene sequence composition. furthermore, among the thirteen probes  giving the highest signals, nine probes perfectly match strain epa <dig> targeted gene regions . thus the two regions  selected for bpha <dig> and ahda2c genes probe designs allow the specific identification of these genes. for the genes phna1a, phna2a, ahda1c, bphb and bphc, only one region can be considered specific for the identification of the genes. finally, for ahda <dig> gene, as no probes give positive signals, we can then hypothesize that ahda <dig> is not expressed or is weakly expressed  in our culture conditions. we can also postulate that absence of signal might reflect a low sensitivity of these selected probes targeting ahda <dig> 

to conclude, these results confirm that our design strategy is useful and efficient for the targeted genes studied. these data also show that it is essential to select at least two specific regions for each studied gene that should be experimentally validated to ensure accurate identification. nevertheless, a majority of selected regions is useful for the design of efficient probes that perfectly hybridize with their targets and show the strongest signal on the microarray.

gene expression analysis with microarray and quantitative real-time pcr experiments
as described previously, the applied design strategy lets us to detect targeted genes from the studied metabolic pathway without prior assumptions. it is thus of interest to test whether our dna microarray is able to evaluate mrna levels semi-quantitatively during biodegradation kinetics with phe, fla and a mixture of the two pollutants as sole carbon and energy source. a control experiment with glucose as sole carbon and energy source is also conducted. for these four conditions, total rnas are extracted from pure cultures of strain epa <dig> at different times of the kinetics . according to the explorative probe validation conclusions , only the most efficient probes targeting each of the eight genes in response to pollutant exposure are considered. in addition, to evaluate the gene expression level, a quantitative reverse transcription pcr approach is also developed for the selected genes during the same times of the kinetics.

transcript hybridizations obtained with only glucose-amended cultures give no positive probe signals  for the different times of the kinetics studied as shown in additional file  <dig>  under phe-growth conditions, specific probes give positive signals  after  <dig> h of growth for all the studied genes . detected signals largely decrease at  <dig> h of culture to reach snr' values under the set threshold. same snr' values, in agreement with absence or low abundance of targeted mrna, are also obtained after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of culture . with fla as carbon source, except for ahda1c, bphc and bphb probes, positive snr' values are also obtained with specific probes after  <dig> h of growth. after  <dig> h of culture with fla, no positive probe signal  is detected, as in glucose-growth conditions . surprisingly, a positive signal for the specific probe targeting bphb is detected after  <dig> h of culture  with fla, but not after  <dig> h of culture. finally, with a mixture of the two pollutants, high positive signals are detected, except for the ahda <dig> gene, under the snr' threshold and for bphc and bphb, just above the snr' threshold, after  <dig> h of culture . after a large decrease in snr' values after  <dig> h of culture, positive signals for most of the probes are visualized after  <dig> h of culture, indicating a new gene expression induction. finally, at  <dig> h of culture, the detected signals have the same snr' values as those obtained with glucose. gene expression results obtained with microarray assays show an up-regulation of all the studied genes with different mrna levels according to pah exposure . for ahda <dig>  no positive signals are detected except with phe after  <dig> h of culture with a snr' close to the threshold .

at the same time, a quantitative reverse transcription pcr based approach is used to precisely describe the gene expression during the growth kinetics. results show the same expression profiles as those observed with dna microarray experiments . low mrna levels are detected during growth on glucose, indicating a very low basal gene expression in the absence of pah substrates. with phe or fla as sole carbon and energy source, a high level of targeted mrna is detected after  <dig> h of growth. however, a higher mrna level is detected with phe exposure. for these two cultures, after  <dig> h of culture, gene transcript number decreases to reach mrna levels close to or below the control copy number detected in glucose-grown cells, as with results visualized with the dna microarrays. with a mixture of the two pollutants, the same expression profile is detected with the quantitative reverse transcription pcr approach and with the dna microarrays. high mrna levels are measured after  <dig> h of culture, and besides a large decrease after  <dig> h of culture, another mrna up-regulation is detected at  <dig> h of culture for the studied genes. finally, mrna levels decrease to reach transcript levels close to growth experiments performed with glucose. in conclusion, similar expression profiles are obtained for phna1a, phna2a, ahda1c, ahda2c, bphb, bphc and bpha <dig> with dna microarray and quantitative reverse transcription pcr approaches, demonstrating the efficiency of probes designed using metabolic design software. thus dna microarrays using metabolic design can be used to perform semi-quantitative monitoring of gene expression.

characterization of potential metabolic capacities in a pah contaminated soil
as we developed explorative probes to detect key genes coding for enzymes involved in pah degradation, we assess the metabolic capacities of endogenous microbial communities in a polluted ecosystem. owing to the difficulty in extracting microbial rna in such environments, we hybridize total extracted microbial dna from a highly contaminated soil . this ecosystem is selected because it harbors high concentrations of pahs . also, phe and fla are detected as major contaminants .

among the  <dig>  designed probes targeting the eight genes,  <dig> give positive signals  after hybridization with total dna . for each gene, probe sets show strong signals, but with variable intensities, identifying the most probable target sequence. to evaluate the explorative capacities of our probes, we first focus on the phna2a gene. we compare the signal intensities between mrna hybridization of strain epa <dig> and the dna extract from the polluted soil . we clearly identify the probe signature for strain epa <dig> and a specific probe signature for the polluted soil. using a blastn approach with complete databases ,  <dig> positive probe sequences have high similarities  with phna2a genes from known pah degraders  . we can then hypothesize that other positive probe sequences presenting a slight homology with available phna2a sequences might have targeted phna2a unknown genes, consistent with the explorative purpose of these probes.

the highest snr' signal is given for a probe targeting ahda1c  among  <dig> other positive probes for this gene. as for phna2a positive probes, several are potentially explorative. interestingly, specific probe targeting ahda1c gene from strain epa <dig> also gives a positive signal . the same positive results are obtained with probes specific to strain epa <dig> genes:  <dig>

surprisingly, no probe can detect phna1a gene in the polluted soil. we choose to amplify, with a pcr approach, phna1a genes using degenerate primers . the pcr products are then cloned, and eight clones are sequenced. among these eight sequences, seven showing high similarities with phna1a genes are then compared with our probe sequences. this comparison reveals multiple mismatches , impeding hybridizations with our probes. this result indicates a marked divergence of this gene family. our first design focused on phna1a genes related to sphingomonas. for a broader discovery of gene diversity, we will need to design probes that take into account more exhaustively the most complete sequence diversity in databases .

discussion
we have developed and validated a new algorithm named metabolic design. this software can be used to design efficient explorative probes for functional dna microarrays. previously to probe design, users have to extract from public  or personal databases, protein sequences of interest. results are then integrated in a user-friendly, intuitive interface. all databases used for the application can be selected by the users and they can also integrate personal data. such flexibility is generally not available, for example with current metabolic reconstruction tools, such as the 'pathway tools software', initially developed for the ecocyc project  <cit> , or kegganim  <cit> . these are generally based on static databases and predefined metabolic pathways .

in order to bypass the faulty annotations found in automatically filled databases, and to allow the exhaustive exploitation of all the currently available protein sequences, the mining step is performed using similarity search. however, such approach presents another major drawback. indeed, in some cases, not all proteins with a similar function have similar primary structures. thus a future development of metabolic design will be the replacement of the blastp step by a pattern hit initiated blast  step coupled with prodom data   <cit> . phi-blast analysis is useful for identifying the distant members of a protein family, whose relationship is not recognizable by straight sequence comparison, but only by patterns contained in sequences . we also intend to integrate a new module for high-throughput ortholog prediction  to improve homologous protein selection for complex and divergent protein families  <cit> .

the ultimate aim of metabolic design is to define explorative probes and estimate their specificity in silico. specific probes deduced from defined degenerate probes thus allow the targeting not only of known gene sequences but also of new ones that encode the same protein sequences. these explorative features are not offered by other tools such as oligoarray  <dig> , yoda or hpd  <cit> . in addition, metabolic design takes into consideration both ex situ and in situ dna microarray synthesis. the inosine composition is taken into account in the total degeneracy, as an ex situ microarray can hold inosine nucleotide probes, and/or degenerate probes in one spot, reducing probe degeneracy.

probe specificity is then evaluated in silico using a proprietary database, giving us a close glimpse of potential cross-hybridizations found in complex environments. in addition, in metabolic design, this database can be modified to consider complete dna data, or only fragmented data . estimation and validation of potential cross-hybridizations are performed by a blastn analysis. however, one possible improvement would be to take into account optimized blastn parameters recently described as allowing a more efficient detection of potential cross-hybridizations  <cit> .

another update of metabolic design will add thermodynamic calculations to improve probe selection, although these parameters are not fully described at present  <cit> . also, it will be essential to take into account probe sensitivity due to sequence nature  <cit> . in view of these difficulties in precisely predicting probe behavior during dna microarray hybridizations, we suggest that users first validate the quality of the dna microarrays , with a simple biological model as we did in this study.

based on metabolic design defined probes, targeting eight genes coding for enzymes involved in the degradation of various pahs by strain epa <dig>  we demonstrate that our design strategy is useful for most of the determined probes. furthermore, these results highlight the capacity of our probes for semi-quantitative monitoring of gene expression or gene detection, confirming the quantitative capability of our microarrays for environmental applications  <cit> . finally, we demonstrate the explorative ability of our probes, studying a complex environment. indeed, most classical functional microarrays  using specific probes will monitor only known sequences and cannot appraise the complete microbial gene diversity of complex environments  <cit> . additionally, considering the high complexity of environmental samples, it will be interesting to improve again probes specificity and sensitivity, using for example the 'goarrays' strategy  <cit> .

to allow the identification of complete sequences of targeted genes, a further application of these explorative dna microarrays will be the capture of 'unknown' sequences for further next-generation sequencing  <cit> . some new techniques have been reported for performing selective capture of sequence fragments from complex mixtures based on hybridization to dna microarrays. combining our explorative dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing will, for example, bypass a critical bottleneck in microbial ecology, namely the difficulty of specifically exploring some biochemical pathways or specific biomarkers without the need to sequence the complete metagenome or pcr products . most often in complex environments even with high throughput sequencing, we obtain only a partial view of the extremely broad microbial diversity. in addition, using mrna or large dna fragments as targets can allow all the genes included in a transcriptional unit to be captured. so, in prokaryotes, like genes involved in the same biological process are generally associated in the same transcriptional unit, this capture would allow to assign of new gene functions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study evaluates the efficiency of a new probe design software tool, metabolic design, dedicated to dna functional microarrays. this software, which can be used to study any group of genes, was successfully applied to define probes able to detect with high specificity and sensitivity genes encoding enzymes involved in pah degradation. in addition, dna microarray experiments performed on soil polluted by organic pollutants, without prior sequence assumptions, demonstrate explorative abilities of our probes. so, probe design performed with metabolic design ensures to precisely monitor metabolic regulations during various processes in complex environments.
