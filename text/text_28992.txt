BACKGROUND
recent analyses of bacterial genomes have revealed that these structures are comprised of a mixture of relatively stable core regions and lineage-specific variable regions ), which commonly contain genes acquired via horizontal gene transfer. in bacteria, horizontal gene transfer occurs via conjugation, dna uptake, transduction and lysogenic conversion, and is mediated largely by mobile genetic elements . mges are present in most sequenced genomes and can account for the bulk of strain-to-strain genetic variability in certain species  <cit> . mges are part of a so-called "flexible gene pool" and shape bacterial genomes by disrupting host genes, introducing novel genes and triggering various rearrangements. one class of mges is derived from bacteriophages and a second is derived from plasmids. both classes may be associated with integrase genes, insertion sequence  elements and transposons, thus forming elements that are mosaic in nature  <cit> . our current knowledge of the impact of mges on their hosts comes primarily from pathogenicity islands in which bacteriophages, plasmids and transposons act as carriers of genes encoding toxins, effector proteins, cell wall modification enzymes, fitness factors, and antibiotic and heavy metal resistance determinants in pathogenic bacteria. much less is known about the diversity and role of mges in nonpathogens, in which these elements may enable their hosts to adapt to changing environmental conditions or colonize new ecological niches.

the present study presents the results of an in-depth structural analysis of the mges in the genome of pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig>  which is the largest pseudomonas genome sequenced to date http://www.pseudomonas.com <cit> . strain pf- <dig> is a model biological control agent that inhabits the rhizosphere of plants and suppresses diseases caused by a wide variety of soilborne pathogens  <cit> . the original analysis of the pf- <dig> genome  <cit>  focused primarily on the strain's metabolic capacity and on the pathways involved in the production of secondary metabolites. the latter encompass nearly six percent of the genome and include antibiotics that are toxic to plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes and contribute to pf-5's broad-spectrum biocontrol activity. the aim of the present study was to more thoroughly analyze and annotate sections of the pf- <dig> genome that contain mges. here, we describe one transposase, six regions containing prophages  and two genomic islands that are present in the pf- <dig> genome.

RESULTS
the genome of p. fluorescens pf- <dig> contains six prophage regions that vary in g+c content from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and two putative genomic islands . three of the prophages exceed  <dig> kb in length and contain genes for transcriptional regulators, dna metabolism enzymes, structural bacteriophage proteins and lytic enzymes.

prophage  <dig> of pf- <dig> and homologous prophages in closely related strains
prophage  <dig> spans  <dig>  bp and consists of genes encoding a myovirus-like tail, holin and lysozyme lytic genes, a putative chitinase gene , and genes for a repressor protein  and a leptin binding protein-like bacteriocin, llpa <dig>  . the tail assembly gene cluster encodes tail sheath , dna circulation , baseplate assembly , and tail fiber  proteins that closely resemble their counterparts from the long contractile tail of the serotype-converting bacteriophage sfv of shigella flexneri  <cit> .

we  previously identified a highly similar prophage element during a study focused on genetic traits contributing to colonization of the plant rhizosphere by p. fluorescens. in that project  <cit> , we applied genomic subtractive hybridization to two strains of p. fluorescens, q8r1- <dig> and q2- <dig>  which differ in their ability to colonize wheat roots. among  <dig> recovered q8r1-96-specific loci was a clone dubbed ssh <dig>  which proved to constitute part of a 22-kb prophage element that closely resembles prophage  <dig> of strain pf- <dig> . like its counterpart, the ssh <dig> prophage from q8r1- <dig> carries genes for a myovirus-like tail , the lytic enzymes holin  and endolysin , and a cro/ci-like repressor protein  . genes in the q8r1- <dig> cluster that are not present in pf- <dig> encode a colicin m-like bacteriocin , a tail collar protein , and putative tail fiber proteins . interestingly, the colicin m-like orf from the ssh <dig> prophage of q8r1- <dig> also encodes an enzymatically active protein although the range of microorganisms sensitive to this bacteriocin is currently unknown .

the homologous prophage elements from pf- <dig> and q8r1- <dig> have simple overall organization, lack integrase and head morphogenesis genes, and carry conserved regulatory, lytic and lambda-like tail morphogenesis genes also found in phage sfv of shigella flexneri . taken together, the results of sequence analyses suggest that these regions are not simple prophage remnants but rather, are similar to f-type pyocins. f-type pyocins were first discovered in p. aeruginosa and represent a class of high molecular weight protease- and nuclease-resistant bacteriocins that resemble flexible and non-contractile tails of bacteriophages  <cit> . this notion is further supported by the fact that the putative lytic genes found within pf- <dig> prophage  <dig>  and q8r1- <dig>  seem to be fully functional. in non-filamentous bacteriophages and bacteriophage tail-like bacteriocins, the lytic activity is provided by the combined action of the small membrane protein holin and a cytoplamic muralytic enzyme, endolysin  <cit> . during phage-mediated cell lysis, holin permeabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane and allows endolysin, which lacks a secretory signal sequence, to gain access to peptidoglycan. to confirm that the prophage 01-like loci indeed encode functional holin and endolysin, we cloned genes pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig> from pf- <dig> and their counterparts from q8r1- <dig>  in escherichia coli under the control of an inducible t <dig> promotor. as shown in fig.  <dig>  induction of both of the putative holin and endolysin genes by iptg had a strong lethal effect on the host, resulting in rapid cell lysis. in accordance with the current model of action of holin and endolysin, the lethal effect of the endolysin encoded by pfl_ <dig> was not apparent unless the cytoplasmic membrane was destabilized by addition of small amount of chloroform to the induced e. coli culture . gene induction experiments carried out with putative holin and endolysin genes from the ssh <dig> locus of q8r1- <dig> had a similar lytic effect on e. coli .

interestingly, a prophage element found in the identical spot  in the genome of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/p_fluorescens has a similar overall organization but contains a p2-like bacteriophage tail cluster  similar to that in phage ctx , thus resembling another class of phage tail-like bacteriocins, the r-type pyocins of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . furthermore, a homologous region from p. fluorescens pf0- <dig>  contains both the lambda-like and p2-like tail clusters , making it similar to the hybrid r2/f <dig> pyocin locus from p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> . the differences in organization of the putative phage tail-like pyocins among these prophages clearly indicate that the corresponding loci are subject to extensive recombination, with a possible recombination hotspot between two highly conserved dna segments comprised of the phage repressor  and holin  genes, and the endolysin  gene .

in strains pf- <dig> and q8r1- <dig>  the putative prophage 01-like pyocins are integrated between muts and the cina-reca-recx genes , which suggests that these elements might be activated during the sos response, as is the putative prophage gene cluster integrated into the muts/cina region of p. fluorescens dc <dig>  <cit> . the muts/cina region is syntenic in several gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , and comparisons reveal that prophage 01-like elements occupy the same site in the genomes of p. fluorescens pf0- <dig>  p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  and p. entomophila l <dig>  <cit> , whereas unrelated prophages reside upstream of cina in p. putida f <dig>  and p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit> . the latter strain, as well as p. putida kt <dig>  <cit> , carry sfv-like bacteriophage tail assembly clusters elsewhere in the genome.

the putative f- and r-pyocins appear to be ubiquitously distributed among strains of p. fluorescens as illustrated by a screening experiment  in which genomic dna of different biocontrol strains was hybridized to probes targeting the lambda-like and p2-like bacteriophage tail gene clusters of q8r1- <dig> and sbw <dig>  respectively. the f- and r-pyocin-specific probes each strongly hybridized to dna from  <dig> of  <dig> p. fluorescens strains, while the remaining  <dig> strains tested positive with both probes.

prophage  <dig> of p. fluorescens pf-5
a second large prophage, prophage  <dig>  spans  <dig>  kb  of the pf- <dig> genome. closely related prophages exist in the genomes of p. putida kt <dig>  <cit>  and p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit>   but were not found in p. fluorescens strains pf0- <dig> or sbw <dig>  prophage  <dig> is a chimeric element that contains a siphovirus head morphogenesis region and a myovirus-like tail assembly region . the prophage also carries a putative integrase gene  that encodes an enzyme similar to shufflon recombinases such as the rci recombinase from plasmid r <dig>  <cit> , a gene involved in dna modification , and a gene for a cytosine-specific methylase . genes encoding a lexa-like repressor , a putative single strand binding protein , and two genes  with similarity to the pyocin transcriptional activator prtn also are present in this region. holin  and endolysin  genes flank a region containing dna packaging and head morphogenesis and tail assembly genes. the p2-like tail assembly region closely resembles the r2-specific part of r2/f <dig> pyocin locus of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit>   and includes genes encoding a tail sheath protein , a tape measure protein , a major tail tube protein , baseplate assembly proteins , and a tail fiber protein . this region also contains genes involved in head morphogenesis  that are not present in the r-part of r2/f2-type pyocin cluster of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  therefore, prophage  <dig> may represent the genome of a temperate bacteriophage rather than an r-type pyocin.

prophage  <dig> and other prophage regions of p. fluorescens pf-5
prophage  <dig> is the largest prophage region of p. fluorescens pf- <dig> and encodes a 56-kb temperate lambdoid phage integrated into trnaser. it is mosaic in nature with no homologues present in strains pf0- <dig> or sbw <dig>  p. fluorescens pf- <dig> carries four genomic copies of trnaser, of which trnaser and trnaser are associated with prophages carrying integrases of different specificity . the anticodon, v- and t-loops of trnaser are parts of the 104-bp putative attb site of prophage  <dig>  whereas the t-loop of trnaser forms part of the 60-bp putative attachment site of prophage  <dig>  the latter is a prophage remnant that spans  <dig>  kb and consists of a gene encoding an atp-dependent nuclease  and a phage integrase gene with two internal frameshift mutations . the mobility of prophage  <dig> probably is mediated by a lambda-type integrase encoded by pfl_ <dig>  which resides adjacent to the putative attr site. prophage  <dig> contains gene modules that are involved in head morphogenesis , dna packaging , dna recombination  and tail morphogenesis . the tail assembly module resembles the corresponding region from burkholderia thailandensis bacteriophage φe <dig>  <cit> , although in prophage  <dig> the module is split by the integration of four extra genes . prophage  <dig> also contains a regulatory circuit with genes for a cro/c <dig> repressor protein  and two putative antirepressor proteins ; a gene for a putative cytosine c5-specific methylase ; and lysis genes encoding holin  and endolysin . however, since the endolysin gene is localized beyond the putative attr site it is not clear whether it represents part of the prophage  <dig> genome or a remnant from integration of a different phage . finally, prophage  <dig> contains two genes, pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig>  which probably arose through gene duplication and encode putative conserved phage-related proteins that are 88% identical to one another.

prophages  <dig> and  <dig> are prophage remnants with reduced size and/or complexity that carry several mutated phage-related genes . prophage  <dig>  has an average g+c content of  <dig> % and contains a putative phage integrase gene adjacent to trnapro . it also carries two genes  that encode minor tail assembly proteins, a gene encoding cro/c <dig> repressor, and the bacteriocin gene llpa <dig> . interestingly, the repressor gene and llpa <dig> are highly similar to their counterparts from prophage  <dig>  suggesting that they arose via gene duplication. prophage  <dig>  a  <dig> -kb prophage remnant, has a g+c content of  <dig> % and carries genes encoding a truncated phage integrase and a putative phage tail protein  . the region is flanked by 84-bp direct repeats, one of which probably represents the attb site and partially overlaps with the anticodon and t loops of trnacys.

genomic island pfgi-1
location and integrase
integrative conjugative elements  are a rapidly growing class of strain-specific mosaic mges that can profoundly impact the adaptation and evolution of bacterial species  <cit> . ices vary in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, encode for mobility loci, and commonly exhibit anomalous g+c content and codon usage. typical ices carry phage-like integrase genes that allow for site-specific integration, most often into trna genes, as well as plasmid-like replication and recombination functions and conjugative machinery that contributes to horizontal transfer. finally, they often carry gene clusters encoding functions that are not essential for the host but that provide an advantage under particular environmental conditions. there is increasing evidence that ices derived from plasmids and encoding host-specific pathogenicity traits as well as traits essential for survival in natural habitats are widely distributed among members of the genus pseudomonas  <cit> .

p. fluorescens pf- <dig> harbors a 115-kb mobile genomic island  <dig>  or pfgi- <dig> , that resembles a large self-transmissible plasmid and exemplifies the first large plasmid-derived mge found in p. fluorescens. of  <dig> putative pfgi- <dig> coding sequences ,  <dig> were classified as hypothetical or conserved hypothetical genes, and  <dig> were unique to pf- <dig> and absent from the genomes of strains sbw <dig> and pf0- <dig> . pfgi- <dig> is integrated into the trnalys gene  situated next to pfl_ <dig>  a cds with similarity to exsb. interestingly, this region has conserved synteny and probably represents an integration "hot spot" for cgis in pseudomonas spp., since putative integrase genes also are found adjacent to exsb in p. aeruginosa ucbpp-pa <dig>  <cit> , p. putida kt <dig>  <cit> , p. syringae pv. syringae b728a  <cit>  and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a  <cit> . pfgi- <dig> spans  <dig>  bp and is flanked by 49-bp direct repeats that include  <dig> bp of the 3' end of trnalys and represent a putative attb site. a recent survey of phage and trna integration sites by williams  <cit>  revealed that sublocation of attb within a trna gene correlates with subfamilies of tyrosine recombinases. according to this classification, the putative attb site of pfgi- <dig> falls into class ia since it encompasses both the t and anticodon loops of trnalys. the integration of pfgi- <dig> probably is controlled by a phage-like tyrosine integrase encoded by pfl_ <dig> located  <dig> bp upstream from trnalys.

genes involved in plasmid replication, recombination, conjugative transfer, and possible origin of pfgi-1
whether pfgi- <dig> exists in strain pf- <dig> or in any other pseudomonas host as an episome is not known. however, the first two-thirds of pfgi- <dig> contain putative plasmid replication, partitioning and conjugation genes that are readily aligned at the dna level with those from plasmid pklc <dig> of p. aeruginosa c  <cit> . the putative origin of replication, oriv, is situated immediately upstream of pfl_ <dig> and spans about  <dig>  bp. plasmid origins of replication often contain arrays of specific ~ <dig> bp repeats, called iterons, that serve as binding sites for the cognate replication initiator rep protein and are involved in replication and partitioning  <cit> . in addition to plasmid-specific iterons, some plasmid origins contain a+t-rich repeats where host replication initiation factors bind and open dna, as well as repeats serving as binding sites for the host dnaa initiator protein. the putative oriv from pfgi- <dig> exhibits typical features of a plasmid replication origin. the first half is a+t-rich and has four conserved direct repeats of a perfect 23-bp palindrome . the second half is represented by a g+c-rich stretch that overlaps with the region between pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig> and contains four conserved 46-bp direct repeats, each of which includes an imperfect 21-bp inverted repeat . the putative oriv is flanked by genes encoding proteins involved in plasmid replication, recombination and segregation, including putative homologues of dnab and parb , a nucleoid associated protein , topoisomerase topa , a putative helicase , a single-strand binding protein , and a partitioning protein, para . pfgi- <dig> does not encode a rep protein, and it is not clear whether it replicates by a theta-type or strand displacement mechanism, although the latter has been suggested for pklc <dig>  <cit> . like some conjugative plasmids, pfgi- <dig> carries homologues of the stress-inducible genes umuc  and umud , which encode a putative lesion bypass dna polymerase and a related accessory protein, respectively. such genes may be involved in plasmid dna repair and umudc-mediated mutagenesis, which could allow plasmids to adapt more quickly to new bacterial hosts  <cit> .

pfgi- <dig> also contains a cluster of  <dig> genes, pillnopqrstuvm  , that spans over  <dig> kb and closely resembles part of the pil region from the self-transmissible e. coli plasmid r <dig>  <cit> . in e. coli, these genes are involved in production of thin flexible sex pili required for mating and transfer of r <dig> in liquid media. the similarity between the pil clusters of r <dig> and pfgi- <dig> suggests that the latter encode mating pili rather than type iv pili involved in bacterial twitching motility, adherence to host cells, biofilm formation and phage sensitivity  <cit> . p. fluorescens pf- <dig> has the capacity to produce type iv pili, and the corresponding biosynthetic genes are located in at least three clusters found outside of pfgi- <dig>  the pfgi- <dig> pil cluster contains genes for pilin protein pils , prepilin peptidase pilu , outer membrane protein piln , nucleotide binding protein pilq , integral membrane protein pilr , and pilus adhesin pilv . unlike r <dig>  pfgi- <dig> does not include a shufflon region that determines recipient specificity in liquid matings via generation of different adhesin types  <cit> . finally, pfgi- <dig> carries genes encoding proteins that may be involved in conjugal dna transfer. pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig> encode for trag-like coupling proteins that may function as membrane-associated ntpases, which during conjugation would mediate transport of dna covalently linked to a putative relaxase protein .

recent studies have demonstrated that ices are a major component of a flexible gene pool of different lineages of gram-negative proteobacteria  <cit> . metabolically versatile members of the pseudomonadaceae are no exception, with ices having been identified among strains of p. aeruginosa  <cit> , p. syringae  <cit> , and p. fluorescens  <cit> . comparison of pfgi- <dig> with islands from other pseudomonas spp. reveals at least six highly conserved gene clusters . these regions include: genes encoding partitioning  and single-strand binding  proteins, pilot proteins , relaxase , integrase , the putative origin of replication, and at least  <dig> conserved hypothetical orfs. the pil operon is another syntenic cluster shared by pfgi- <dig> and the pathogenicity islands pkcl <dig> and papi- <dig>  and pphgi- <dig> of p. aeruginosa and and gi- <dig> of p. syringae. these findings further confirm the results of a recent study by mohd-zain et al.  <cit> , who compared the evolutionary history of  <dig> core genes in  <dig> gis from different β- and γ-proteobacteria and found that despite their overall mosaic organization, many genomic islands including those from pseudomonas spp. share syntenic core elements and evolutionary origin.

putative phenotypic traits encoded by pfgi-1
as a rule, ices carry unique genes that reflect the lifestyles of their hosts. in p. aeruginosa and p. syringae, ices encode pathogenicity factors that allow these bacteria to successfully colonize a variety of hosts, as well as metabolic, regulatory, and transport genes that most probably enable them to thrive in diverse habitats  <cit> . an unusual self-transmissible ice, the clc element from the soil bacterium pseudomonas sp. b <dig>  enables its host to metabolize chlorinated aromatic compounds  <cit> .

in pfgi- <dig>  a unique ~ <dig> kb dna segment that is absent from pklc <dig> and other closely related ices  encodes "cargo" genes that are not immediately related to integration, plasmid maintenance or conjugative transfer. some of these genes are present in a single copy and do not have homologues elsewhere in the pf- <dig> genome. about half of pfgi- <dig> "cargo" genes also are strain-specific and have no homologues in genome of p. fluorescens pf0- <dig> 

how could genes encoded by pfgi- <dig> contribute to the survival of p. fluorescens pf- <dig> in the rhizosphere? some of them might facilitate protection from environmental stresses. for example, nonheme catalases similar to the one encoded by pfl_ <dig>  are bacterial antioxidant enzymes containing a dimanganese cluster that catalyzes the disproportionation of toxic hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen  <cit> . pfgi- <dig> also carries a putative cardiolipin synthase gene  and a cluster of four genes, cyoabcd , that encode components of a cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase complex. in p. putida, cardiolipin synthase was implicated in adaptation to membrane-disturbing conditions such as exposure to organic solvents  <cit> , whereas the cytochrome o oxidase complex was shown to be highly expressed under low-nutrient conditions such as those found in the rhizosphere, and to play a crucial role in a proton-dependent efflux system involved in toluene tolerance  <cit> . finally, pfgi- <dig> cargo genes with predicted regulatory functions include a ggdef-motif protein , a two-component response regulator with a chey domain  and a sensor histidine kinase . although the exact role of these genes remains unknown, the ggdef domain proteins represent an emerging class of bacterial regulators involved in the synthesis of bis--cyclic dimeric gmp, a global signaling messenger  <cit> , and two-component signal-transduction systems are widely employed by gram-negative bacteria to sense changes in the environment and appropriately modulate the expression of certain genes  <cit> .

genomic island pfgi-2
genomic island  <dig>  or pfgi- <dig>  spans  <dig>  kb and has an average g+c content of  <dig> %. it is flanked by imperfect 51-bp direct repeats, one of which partially overlaps with trnaleu and probably represents the attb site . although p. fluorescens pf- <dig> does not have a type iii protein secretion pathway, approximately half of pfgi- <dig>  closely resembles a gene cluster found in the exchangeable effector locus  of a tripartite type iii secretion pathogenicity island  from the plant pathogen p. viridiflava strain me <dig> b  <cit>  . even the presence of a putative phage integrase gene   and integration into trnaleu immediately downstream of the tgt and quea genes is typical of t-pai islands from p. viridiflava  <cit>  and p. syringae  <cit> . in addition to t-pai-like genes, pfgi- <dig> contains a putative phage-related mvat-like  transcriptional regulator, a superfamily ii helicase , a putative nucleoid-associated protein , and a putative nuclease . none of the aforementioned homologues of pfgi- <dig> genes in p. viridiflava have been characterized experimentally to date, making in difficult to deduce the function, if any, of this genome region. it also is possible that pfgi- <dig> is inactive and simply represents a t-pai-like remnant anchored in the pf- <dig> chromosome.

transposons of p. fluorescens pf-5
unlike the genomes of other pseudomonas spp., that of p. fluorescens pf- <dig> is devoid of is elements and contains only one cds  that appears to encode a full-length transposase. three other transposase-like cdss  found in the pf- <dig> genome contain frameshifts or encode truncated proteins. pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig> encode is66-like transposases and are found within a large cluster  of conserved hypothetical genes. corrupted transposases encoded by pfl_ <dig> and pfl_ <dig> belong to the is <dig> family and are associated with gene clusters encoding a putative filamentous hemagglutinin and prophage  <dig>  respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
recent analyses have revealed that most sequenced bacterial genomes contain prophages formed when temperate bacteriophages integrate into the host genome  <cit> . in addition to genes encoding phage-related functions, many prophages carry non-essential genes that can dramatically modify the phenotype of the host, allowing it to colonize or survive in new ecological niches  <cit> . our knowledge of the ecological role of pseudomonas prophages is limited, but data from other bacterial species suggest ways in which prophage regions could affect the survival of p. fluorescens pf- <dig> in natural habitats.

temperate bacteriophages similar to those encoded by prophages  <dig> and  <dig> are capable of development through both lysogenic and lytic pathways, and the presence of prophages can protect the host from superinfection by closely related bacteriophages  <cit> . on the other hand, the lytic pathway ultimately results in phage-induced host cell lysis, and it has been reported that the presence of virulent bacteriophages can adversely affect rhizosphere-inhabiting strains of p. fluorescens  <cit> . similarly bacteriophage tail-like bacteriocins such as the one encoded by prophage  <dig> are capable of killing both closely and more distantly related strains of bacteria, presumably through destabilization of the cell membrane  <cit> .

temperate bacteriophages and bacteriophage-like elements also are an important part of the bacterial flexible gene pool and actively participate in horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . among the putative lysogenic conversion genes in p. fluorescens pf- <dig> are two copies of llpa, located adjacent to prophages  <dig> and  <dig>  these genes encode low-molecular weight bacteriocins resembling plant mannose-binding lectins that kill sensitive strains of pseudomonas spp. via a yet-unidentified mechanism  <cit> . the fact that both llpa copies reside near prophage repressor genes, as well as the involvement of a reca-dependent sos response in llpa production by a different strain of pseudomonas  <cit> , suggests that the association of llpa genes with prophages is not accidental and that the prophages may be involved in the regulation of bacteriocin production in p. fluorescens pf- <dig> 

the analysis of mges revealed at least  <dig> cdss not present in the original pf- <dig> genome annotation . the bulk of these newly predicted cdss fall in the category of conserved hypothetical genes of bacterial or phage origin. predicted products of the remaining novel cdss exhibit similarity to proteins of diverse enzymatic, regulatory, and structural functions and include a phage integrase, an atp-dependent dna ligase, an endonuclease, plasmid partitioning and stabilization proteins, a nadh-dependent fmn reductase, an acytransferase, a prtn-like transcriptional regulator, a com-like regulatory protein, a p-pilus assembly and an integral membrane protein.

taken together, the analyses of six prophage regions and two gis in the pf- <dig> genome indicate that these structures have evolved via exchange of genetic material with other pseudomonas spp. and extensive recombination. transposition is unlikely to have played a major role in this evolution, as the genome of pf- <dig> is nearly devoid of transposons and is elements that are common in certain other pseudomonas genomes. most of the  <dig> kb comprising mges in the pf- <dig> genome is similar to corresponding regions in the genomes of other pseudomonas spp. nevertheless, the mges also include regions unique to the pf- <dig> genome that could contribute to the bacterium's fitness in the soil or rhizosphere.
