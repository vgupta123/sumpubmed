BACKGROUND
two major types of structures dominate actin formations in cells: unbranched filaments that are bundled together and branched networks of unbundled filaments. in the migrating cell, the leading edge contains both types of actin structure, branched networks of actin filaments that form lamellipodia and parallel bundles that form filopodia.

the arp2/ <dig> complex, a seven subunit complex containing two actin-related proteins , is responsible for the generation of branched networks of actin filaments. arp2/ <dig> complex cooperates with proteins such as cofilin and gelsolin that make available actin templates for arp2/ <dig> complex to form branches . the arp2/ <dig> complex is activated by wasp-family proteins via a variety of different signal inputs such as activation of tyrosine kinase receptors and small gtpases of the rho-family . activation of arp2/ <dig> complex increases its binding to the sides of actin filaments and induces the formation of an actin branch, which grows and is thought to push against the plasma membrane causing lamellipodial protrusions. lamellipodial networks are subsequently reorganised so that the cell can form specialised structures for motility.

it has been proposed that filopodia are generated by the reorganisation of an arp2/ <dig> complex generated actin network  <cit> . proteins that mediate filament elongation  bind to actin filaments in lamellipodia and come together to form a filopodial tip complex that elongates a group of actin filaments forming a filopodium. however, lamellipodia do not seem to be essential for filopodia formation, as filopodia form regardless of loss of most of the arp2/ <dig> complex or the scar/wave complex in mammalian cells or in dictyostelium  <cit> . furthermore, it seems unlikely that all filopodia are largely dependent on a dendritic network, as spreading fibroblasts and platelets clearly produce filopodia in the absence of detectable lamellipodia  <cit> .

here, we describe the localisation of the arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia in a manner that is apparently independent of adhesion but coincident with the localisation of other lamellipodial proteins to filopodia and dependent on rac <dig> signaling. we suggest that filopodia in spreading cells may contain regions of lamellipodial activity, which could offer the cell flexibility in its motility choices.

RESULTS
the arp2/ <dig> complex localises to filopodia during cell spreading
after attachment to the fibronectin substrate, mouse embryonic fibroblasts  produced filopodia within  <dig> minutes . filopodia production is followed by extension of lamellipodia and cell spreading continued with repeated cycles of filopodia and lamellipodia assembly. once lamellipodial extension had begun, the spread area of the cell continually increased until  <dig> minutes after plating, with very little or no retraction of the cell perimeter . between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes mefs began to form a more characteristic fibroblast shape but there was little change in the total cell area .

we aimed to determine the involvement of arp2/ <dig> complex in cell spreading, so first we localised arp2/ <dig> complex in spreading mef. figure 1a shows a sequence of representative photos of arp2/ <dig> complex localization during a spreading time course. at approximately  <dig> minutes after plating, before lamellipodia were formed, arp2/ <dig> complex had a punctate localisation in the cytoplasm. from  <dig> minutes onwards arp2/ <dig> complex was at the edge of the cell as well as cytoplasmic. between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, the localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to the cell cortex became more distinct and lamellipodia were present at multiple sites. by  <dig> minutes, arp2/ <dig> complex was usually restricted to a few well-defined lamellipodial protrusions with intense labelling.

unexpectedly, arp2/ <dig> complex was also localised to some of the filopodia-like actin protrusions  produced during spreading. a monoclonal antibody to arp <dig> showed near identical labelling to the p34-arc antibody in lamellipodia, on cytoplasmic spots and in filopodia . we identified the protrusions as filopodia by expressing the filopodial actin bundling protein fascin  <cit>  tagged with gfp in spreading cells. in cells expressing relatively low levels of fascin, cell morphology was not affected . in low expressing cells, fascin labelled the filopodial-like protrusions that contained arp2/ <dig> complex but fascin and arp2/ <dig> complex were not especially coincident in filopodia .

we next examined the dynamics of the actin structures that contained arp2/ <dig> complex to confirm that they behaved as typical filopodia- i.e. thin projections that grew from the cell edge and whose tips moved relative to the cell body  <cit> . arp2/ <dig> complex containing filopodia were identified by immunofluorescence and these same filopodia found in correlative dic time lapses. at least some of the filopodia labelled with arp2/ <dig> complex were actively protruding filopodia . the behaviour of the structures labelled with arp2/ <dig> complex, together with the molecular evidence from the labelling with fascin, confirmed that we were frequently observing genuine filopodia that contained multiple spots of arp2/ <dig> complex.

having established these structures as filopodia, we measured their occurrence during cell spreading. at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes about 30% of filopodia contained arp2/ <dig> complex and by  <dig> minutes this had increased to 40% . correlative dic time-lapse and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that discounting retraction fibres at  <dig> minutes, cells had 36% arp2/ <dig> complex containing filopodia, which agrees with data from fixed cell studies . arp2/ <dig> complex is present in filopodia at the earliest stages of spreading and, as with lamellipodia, filopodia were more frequent and strongly labelled by arp2/ <dig> complex at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes . a range of cell types contained arp2/ <dig> complex in their filopodia, including j <dig> macrophages, hela, human embryonic lung fibroblasts  and the social amoeba dictyostelium  <cit> . thus, the localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia seems to be a general but often overlooked feature of cytoskeletal organization.

the dynamics of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia suggested regions of lamellipodial activity within filopodia
lamellipodia are protrusions of membrane driven by dendritic networks of actin, while filopodia are classically thought to be driven by parallel bundles of elongating actin filaments. we examined the dynamics of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia during cell spreading using p21-arc subunit of the arp2/ <dig> complex tagged with gfp. rfp actin was co-expressed to confirm the location of filopodia. the patches of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia were highly dynamic, changing size and intensity much in the same way as lamellipodial ruffles . arp2/ <dig> complex puncta appeared and disappeared within filopodia, rather than seeming to be transported from within the cell or from lamellipodia.

from time-lapse fluorescent imaging, arp2/ <dig> complex was present in both filopodia extending from a dynamic leading edge  and in less dynamic filopodia present at previously retracted cell edges . of the several filopodia containing arp2/ <dig> complex analyzed  by live imaging the patches did not apparently become larger areas of protrusion even when positioned immediately in front of the leading edge. therefore, we do not think that individual small arp2/ <dig> complex patches that we have observed in filopodia lead to a larger lamellipodial expansion, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this is a rare event or that coalescence of several patches might not lead to lamellipodial expansion.

arp2/ <dig> complex localisation to filopodia is not dependent on vinculin, microtubules or local interaction with a fibronectin surface
the focal adhesion protein vinculin has been reported to directly associate with the arp2/ <dig> complex during spreading  <cit>  and therefore we looked at the localisation of vinculin and arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia. filopodia were labelled with vinculin in varying degrees in some cases as intensely as in focal adhesions . arp2/ <dig> complex and vinculin were occasionally coincident in filopodia but did not show the same distribution . we observed this general staining pattern in over  <dig> cells in three separate experiments. we concluded that vinculin did not strongly co-localise with arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia during the first  <dig> minutes of spreading. to further explore the potential involvement of vinculin in localizing arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia we made use of vinculin null mefs. after  <dig> minutes cells lacking vinculin had similar morphology to wild type cells  with 33% of filopodia containing arp2/ <dig> complex at  <dig> minutes also comparable to wild type cells . paxillin, also part of the focal adhesion complex, similarly showed some coincidence with arp2/ <dig> complex but no clear co-localisation . thus, neither vinculin nor paxillin were reliably co-localised with arp2/ <dig> complex and vinculin was not required for localising arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia. disruption of microtubules also did not have any effect on the localization of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia, although the morphology of the filopodia was altered, with cells displaying many clubbed or bent filopodia .

by using bsa to block cell adhesion after initial attachment to a glass substrate  <cit>  we could assess the cell adhesion requirements of arp2/ <dig> complex localisation. after  <dig> minutes, cells did not have lamellipodia and no localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to the cortex was seen . filopodia were abundant and the majority of them were clubbed  as with inhibition of microtubules . this suggested that lamellipodia but not filopodia were dependent on an adhesive surface.

to further explore the role of adhesion in arp2/ <dig> complex recruitment to filopodia, we designed a micropatterned surface that contained both adhesive and non-adhesive areas. this had the advantage of activating outside-in signaling pathways while enabling us to examine how the cell interacted with non-adhesive areas. to visualise the pattern, fibronectin was labelled with the fluorophore cy <dig> and we confirmed that mefs showed normal spreading, arp2/ <dig> complex localisation and adhesion formation on a homogenous cy <dig> fibronectin surface . mef cells were able to spread on both  <dig> and  <dig> μm stripes and the orientation of spreading was always in the direction of the striped pattern 

cells spread on these patterned surfaces frequently protruded filopodia into non-adhesive areas . vinculin was absent from areas of filopodia that were extended over non-adhesive areas, whereas arp2/ <dig> complex was often present . we concluded that the localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia is independent of local adhesion to a fibronectin surface.

arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia is present with cortactin and at the sites of free barbed ends
cortactin functions with arp2/ <dig> complex to form branched actin networks and therefore when present at the cell cortex is a lamellipodial marker  <cit> . anti-cortactin strongly labelled both lamellipodia and filopodia  and increases in cortactin labelling were often coincident with similar increases in arp2/ <dig> complex labelling in distinct areas .

the presence of cortactin suggested that arp2/ <dig> complex was active and generating an actin network. actin monomers fluorescently labelled with cy <dig> were used to probe for free barbed ends at these sites  <cit> . labelled actin was incorporated into lamellipodia of spreading cells  and also into sites of arp2/ <dig> complex localisation in filopodia . other sites in filopodia were not labelled showing that free barbed ends are not concentrated elsewhere in filopodia.

the localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia is regulated by rac activity
since the arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia co-localized with lamellipodial markers such as free barbed ends, cortactin and capping protein , we tested whether arp2/ <dig> complex localisation to filopodia was rac <dig> dependent. as previously described  <cit> , expression of the dominant negative form of cdc <dig> completely blocked spreading of mefs . cells expressing dominant negative t17n rac <dig> showed a reduction in cell area and complete loss of lamellipodia . after  <dig> minutes of spreading arp2/ <dig> complex labelling of filopodia in t17n rac expressing cells was very weak  despite the fact that the labelling of cytoplasmic actin spots with arp2/ <dig> complex was normal . we concluded that inhibiting lamellipodia with t17n rac interfered with arp2/ <dig> complex localisation to filopodia.

expression of dominant negative t17n rac <dig> caused a significant reduction in the number of filopodia compared to untransfected controls . following rac inhibition, filopodia appeared uniform and straight and clubbed filopodia made up 30% of filopodia  after  <dig> minutes spreading . we concluded that rac was not essential for the formation of filopodia during spreading but does have a role in their assembly and morphology.

expression of active rac <dig> causes constitutive lamellipodia formation . when we spread mefs expressing constitutively active rac <dig> two different morphologies were present: radial  and polyhedral . radial cells were the predominant phenotype with polyhedral cells commonly making up 20–30% of the population at  <dig> minutes and the polyhedral phenotype was absent in active rac <dig> expressing cells prior to trypsin treatment and spreading . while radial cells lacked filopodia, polyhedral cells showed a remarkable induction of arp2/ <dig> complex to their filopodia with the vast majority showing labelling .

discussion
our data suggest that arp2/ <dig> complex is localised to both the filopodia and lamellipodia of spreading fibroblasts. while arp2/ <dig> complex is typically thought of as a lamellipodial protein, it has been observed in filopodia of dictyostelium and acanthamoeba  <cit>  and can crosslink actin filaments in addition to the much more well-characterised actin nucleation properties  <cit> . there have been mixed reports about whether arp2/ <dig> complex localizes to mammalian cell filopodia. in b16f <dig> melanoma cells, arp2/ <dig> complex was reported to be excluded from filopodia  <cit> , while a previous study stated that arp2/ <dig> complex was only excluded from most filopodia in fibroblasts  <cit> . although arp2/ <dig> complex has been observed in filopodia, its function here has not been well defined, perhaps because it is a relatively minor component of filopodia and very prominent in lamellipodia. however, the presence of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia may have implications for our understanding of their dynamics.

just as lamellipodial actin feeds into other actin structures such as cell junctions  <cit> , the actin network generated by arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia may provide filaments of different orientations for filopodia dynamics or for assembly of other structures  <cit> . we have found that arp2/ <dig> complex is present in angled and clubbed filopodia, both situations where non-linear filaments could be present . of course careful electron microscope studies would be needed to determine if branched networks could be formed in filopodia, but our preliminary results using critical point drying and platinum replica methods  <cit>  show that lamellipodial networks do sometimes protrude from filopodia of mef . importantly, the existence of stable branched networks even in lamellipodia has recently been called into question by one group, who propose that critical point drying methods of preparation for electron microscopy may promote branching of filaments <cit> . although lamellipodial protrusions from filopodia may have been observed previously, this is not widely discussed in the literature. short actin filaments have been observed to occur in the tips of dictyostelium filopodia  <cit>  and to be associated with the elongating "tip complex" of these filopodia. we did see arp2/ <dig> complex in the tips of clubbed filopodia, which may have correlated with the tip complex.

the formation of new adhesions is occurring during spreading and was an obvious possibility to explain the presence of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia. demali et al. showed  <cit>  that vinculin transiently associated with arp2/ <dig> complex during spreading and that this association might promote actin assembly at or near new adhesions. most of the arp2/ <dig> complex we saw in filopodia did not co-localise with vinculin or with adhesion sites. however, we did frequently see arp2/ <dig> complex co-localisation with vinculin at bends and angled regions of filopodia . it is still possible that arp2/ <dig> complex is transiently recruited to new adhesions, as is also suggested by recent work demonstrating a connection with focal adhesion kinase  <cit> , but vinculin binding does not appear to be required for the recruitment of arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia, nor does adhesion to substratum.

arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia could be as a precursor to the lamellipodial expansion that is often seen in spreading cells, and which we observed with mefs . in agreement with a model where arp2/ <dig> complex is recruited to nascent filopodia in order to promote spreading of cells and progression to lamellipodia, we found that rac inhibition dramatically decreased localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex to filopodia. arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia was distinguishable from localisation to persistent lamellipodia that have been shown to be sensitive to nocodazole treatment  <cit>  and dependent on adhesion  <cit> . the localisation of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia is upstream of adhesion formation and receptor engagement although whether arp2/ <dig> complex is actively producing an actin network in this situation is unclear. however, we never observed a single spot of arp2/ <dig> complex in a filopodium progress to become a lamellipodial protrusion, so either this is a low-frequency event or an additional event needs to take place, such as coalescence of several arp2/3-rich areas within a filopod for lamellipodial progression to occur.

our initial results with fluorescently labelled actin monomers suggest that there are free barbed ends near the sites of arp2/ <dig> complex enrichment in filopodia. recently it has been shown that rac is crucial is for the stabilization of protrusion  <cit>  and perhaps the distinction between the characteristics of arp2/ <dig> complex in filopodia is due to its involvement in this stabilization.

svitkina and colleagues have described a role for the filopodial protein mdia <dig> in lamellipodia assembly and a molecular connection between the scar/wave complex protein abi <dig> and mdia <dig>  <cit> . thus, they also propose crosstalk between filopodia and lamellipodia. while it is clear that full activity of arp2/ <dig> complex is not necessary for the generation of filopodia in all cells and conditions  <cit> , these structures can be interdependent  <cit> . in a 3-dimensional network, crawling cells likely have to change between filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions as well as navigating turns and bends more than on a glass coverslip, so it will be interesting to determine whether filopodia made in 3d also have lamellipodial elements.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that lamellipodial networks may exist in filopodia and that these may be important in the dynamics of filopodia or perhaps in transitions between lamellipodial and filopodial modes of protrusion. our results also suggest that arp2/ <dig> complex networks do not necessarily only contribute to lamellipodia or remain branched in cells, in agreement with other recent work  <cit> .
