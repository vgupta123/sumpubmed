BACKGROUND
oxidized fatty acids that are collectively termed oxylipins exhibit signaling functions in fungi  <cit> , mammals  <cit>  and flowering plants  <cit> . also non-flowering plants like mosses have been shown to contain oxylipins, but knowledge on their physiological role is still scarce  <cit> . in flowering plants the oxylipin derivative jasmonic acid  regulates developmental processes as well as defense responses  <cit> . this plant hormone is synthesized via the so-called allene oxide synthase  branch of the oxylipin pathway that takes place in two spatially separated cell compartments  <cit> : it may start in the plastid with the release of 18: <dig> ) from a membrane lipid by the action of a lipase  <cit> . the free fatty acid may then be oxidized by a specific 13s-lipoxygenase  yielding 13s-hydroperoxy octadecatrienoic acid ). this product serves as substrate for further sequential reactions that are catalyzed by two enzymes: the aos transforms 13s-hpot in a first reaction step to a highly unstable allene oxide which hydrolyses in aqueous solution within  <dig> seconds yielding α-ketol and γ-ketol as well as cyclopentenone derivatives  <cit> . in the presence of the second enzyme, the allene oxide cyclase , however, the allene oxide is cyclized to enantiopure cis-12-oxo phytodienoic acid -opda)  <cit> . cis-opda is transported into the peroxisome where it is reduced to the respective cyclopentanone derivative  <cit>  and further processed by three rounds of β-oxidation finally yielding -7-iso-ja  <cit> .

over the last years several studies in the moss physcomitrella patens described an oxylipin pathway analogous to that of flowering plants  <cit> . however, in contrast to flowering plants this moss contains besides c18- also c20-polyunsaturated fatty acids which are typically found in mammalian cells. further, p. patens is able to metabolize both groups yielding a set of diverse oxylipins . in an initial reaction step two unusual bifunctional loxs may oxidize 20: <dig> at the c- <dig> yielding 12-hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid   <cit> . this product serves as a substrate for at least three enzyme reactions that may lead to the formation of different c8- and c9-products: these volatiles are either formed by the hydroperoxide cleaving activity of the bifunctional loxs  <cit>  or by a classical hydroperoxide lyase  belonging to the cyp <dig> enzyme family  <cit> . on the other hand 12-hpete can also be dehydrated by ppaos yielding  <dig> -epoxy eicosatetraenoic acid   <cit> . in analogy to the clas-sical octadecanoid pathway, this unstable allene oxide is re-arranged by one particular aoc  forming 11-oxo prostatrienoic acid   <cit> . the molecular basis for this distinct substrate specificity of ppaoc <dig> and the mechanism of the cyclization reaction catalyzed by ppaoc <dig> and  <dig> has recently been investigated by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies demonstrated that upon wounding and pathogen attack only cis-opda, but no ja accumulated in p. patens. these findings led to the hypothesis that, in contrast to higher plants, p. patens harbors only the plastid-localized part of the oxylipin pathway, while the peroxisomal part is missing  <cit> . in line with this assumption were immunocytological investigations that demonstrated the plastidic localization of pplox and ppaoc  <cit> .

aos and hpl together with two further members, divinylether synthase  and epoxyalcohol synthase, belong to the cytochrome p <dig> subfamily cyp <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to classical p450s these enzymes do not act as monooxygenases but rather as hydroperoxide isomerases  or dehydratases   <cit> . consequently, since they use fatty acid hydroperoxides as their natural substrate, cyp74s - in contrast to classical p450s - do neither need molecular oxygen nor external electron donors for catalysis. the 3d-structures of two aoss from arabidopsis and guayule demonstrated that these functional differences in cyp74- and p450-catalysis can be explained by different active site architectures that preclude monooxygenase-activity from those unusual p450s  <cit> . despite this progress in understanding the underlying structure-function relationship, there are mechanistic aspects that are still not fully understood. recently, it has been established that the catalytic trajectories of different cyp74s are closely related  <cit>  and single point mutations may be sufficient to inter-convert cyp74-activities  <cit> . for example, for ataos it was demonstrated that mutation of one particular phenylalanine residue  which may be responsible for stabilizing intermediately formed carbon centered substrate radicals converts aos into hpl activity  <cit> . in addition, the close interconnection of both trajectories is also mirrored by mutational studies that identified two conserved amino acids in the i-helix region of aos. substitution of this phe and ser  by ile and ala, respectively, led to an enzyme with hpl-activity  <cit> . similar results were obtained when lys- <dig> and thr <dig> were exchanged in tomato aos <dig> by ser and tyr, respectively  <cit> .

in the present study we identified an additional aos enzyme, ppaos <dig>  and analyzed the biochemical properties of cyp74-enzymes from p. patens. we established a recombinant e. coli expression system that enabled us to produce and purify ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig> as well as pphpl in high amounts and to analyze a set of different biochemical parameters and compare those for the different enzymes. by employing site directed mutagenesis we provide further evidence that the inter-conversion of cyp74-activites by specific single amino acid exchanges can also be applied on substrate unspecific aos. besides the molecular details of cyp74-catalysis, we also aimed to analyze the sub-cellular localization and physiological function of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig>  localization studies using yfp-labeled aos demonstrated that ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid while ppaos <dig> is only detected within the cytosol. interestingly, the knock-out mutants of neither ppaos <dig> nor ppaos <dig> showed a morphological phenotype deviating from wild type.

RESULTS
identification of a third cyp <dig> enzyme from p. patens
previously two cyp <dig> enzymes were identified from p. patens, a hpl   <cit>  and an aos   <cit> . further analysis of est sequences and the genome of p. patens revealed the existence of a third putative cyp <dig> enzyme. by sequence homology it was supposed to be also an aos, named ppaos <dig>  sequence alignments of cyp74s from different plants with the p. patens enzymes showed that similar to pphpl  <cit>  also both aos isoforms  contain sequence motifs characteristic for members of the cyp74-family  <cit> . besides the exxr motif that is typical for all p450-enzymes  <cit> , the three sequences also include the distinctive nine amino acid insert in the heme signature motif harboring the essential cysteine residue that serves as the 5th heme ligand  <cit> . as has been observed for pphpl, a phylogenetic analysis shows that all cyp <dig> from p. patens do not group with other members of different cyp74-subfamilies from flowering plants   <cit> , suggesting that there are significant differences in their amino acid sequences. in order to verify the tentative identification of ppaos <dig> as aos, we cloned both ppaos isoforms and expressed them in addition to pphpl in e. coli.

cloning and expression
both aos genes were pcr-amplified from a cdna library of p. patens protonema and were expressed in e. coli in frame with a n-terminal hexahistidine peptide. in order to improve the protein yield of pphpl, we added the makktss-sequence that has been used previously for improving the solubility of ataos  <cit> . the resulting fragment was re-cloned in frame with a c-terminal hexahistidine sequence and expressed in e. coli. protein extraction was essentially performed as reported before  <cit> . by this ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> as well as pphpl could be purified nearly to homogeneity .

throughout all preparations, buffers showed a reddish color which suggested the presence of a heme co-factor. indeed, when uv/vis spectra of ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig> and pphpl were recorded, in every case an absorption profile that is characteristic for heme proteins was detectable: while the uv/vis spectra showed distinctive heme absorption maxima at  <dig> nm ,  <dig> nm  for ppaos <dig> and 411nm  and  <dig> nm  for ppaos <dig> , pphpl had absorption maxima at  <dig> nm ,  <dig> nm ,  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm  . it should be noted at this point, that the heme occupancy of both ppaos-isoforms was significantly reduced: based on theoretical molar extinction coefficients at  <dig> nm  ≈  <dig> m- <dig> cm- <dig> and ε <dig> ≈  <dig> m- <dig> cm-1; as calculated with the protparam-software tool ) and an expected molar extinction coefficient for the soret-band of εsoret ≈  <dig>  <dig> m- <dig> cm- <dig>  we calculated a heme-content of ppaos <dig> of approx. 30% while that of ppaos <dig> was only 4%.

ph-optimum and kinetic properties
in order to identify the optimal ph of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig>  the conversion of 13s-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid  was followed photometrically at  <dig> nm in dependence on different ph values. while ppaos <dig> showed the highest activity around ph  <dig> , the optimal ph for ppaos <dig> was at ph  <dig> .

kinetic properties were analyzed in analogous experiments in which the catalytic activity was measured in dependence on the substrate concentration at the respective optimal ph value. as substrates we used the  <dig> and 13-hydroperoxides derived from 18: <dig>  9-/13-hpod, 18: <dig>  9/13-hpot, 18: <dig>  9/13-hpot, as well as the 12-hydroperoxy derivative of 20: <dig>  12-hpete. kinetic constants that were determined by plotting the experimentally derived data points to the michaelis-menten equation are summarized in table  <dig>  exemplarily shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> are the michaelis-menten plots for the conversion of 9-hpot by ppaos <dig>  and ppaos <dig> . the given kcat-values were calculated by taking into account that the heme occupancy of both ppaos were 30% and 4%, respectively . based on the kcat/km-values, these results show that ppaos <dig> isomerizes 9- and 13-hydroperoxides derived from 18: <dig>  18: <dig> and 18: <dig> with a similar specificity as 12-hpete. interestingly, the kinetic data showed that in contrast to ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig>  has a distinct specificity for 12-hpete; while this substrate was specifically converted with a kcat/km of  <dig> ×  <dig> min- <dig> m- <dig> the c18-hydroperoxy derivatives were only very poor substrates with kcat/km-values below  <dig> ×  <dig> min- <dig> m- <dig> 

kinetic properties were determined by measuring the initial time-dependent substrate consumption at  <dig> nm at different substrate concentrations typically ranging from 2– <dig> μm. in some cases the highest substrate concentration applied was  <dig> μm. for analysis between  <dig> and  <dig> data points were fitted to the michaelis-menten equation. note that ppaos1-concentrations used for incubations with 9- and 13-hpot were different  from those used for incubations with the other substrates . kcat values are corrected to 100% heme occupancy from the ~30% heme content in the enzyme preparation.

product analysis and site directed mutagenesis
as activity of ppaos <dig> with c18-hydroperoxy fatty acids is very low, we decided to verify the enzymatic properties of the aos towards these substrates by analyzing the produced ketol derivatives via lc-ms. as substrate we chose 9s-hydroperoxy octadecadienoic acid  and compared product formation after incubation with ppaos <dig> as well as ppaos <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig> these analyses demonstrated that indeed both enzymes  are aos, since they both formed α-ketols from 9-hpod.

subsequently, molecular determinants that may be essential for the activity of hpl and aos from p. patens were analyzed. the focus was on ppaos <dig> and pphpl, because those enzymes showed, in contrast to the well studied aos from a. thaliana <cit> , a broad substrate specificity metabolizing  <dig> as well as 13-hydroperoxy fatty acid derivatives. using these enzymes we wanted to address the question whether the determinants reported for 13-hydroperoxide specific ataos also influence the catalysis of unspecific aos enzymes. for this, we generated a set of different ppaos <dig> and pphpl variants and analyzed the product specificity with the 9- and 13-hydroperoxy isomers of 18: <dig> and 18: <dig> by rp-hplc. a representative example is shown in figure  <dig>  incubations of 9-hpod with ppaos1_wt yielded besides α- and γ-ketols, which are derived from a non-enzymatical hydrolysis of the allene oxide product, also significant amounts of the characteristic hpl product, 9-oxo nonanoic acid. on the other hand, analogous incubations demonstrated that purified pphpl catalyzed the conversion of 9-hpod to the main product 9-oxo nonanoic acid as well as to a set of different site products inter alia α- and γ-ketols. similar results were obtained when 9-, 13-hpot or 13-hpod were used as substrate . these results are consistent with a close interconnection of both enzymatic pathways as proposed before  <cit> .

affinity purified enzymes were incubated with -labeled hydroperoxy fatty acids for approx.  <dig> min. after extraction products were analyzed by rp-hplc that was coupled to a radio-detector and quantified by integration of the respective peak area. for simplicity the relative amounts of each product is indicated by the number of “+”. aos, allene oxide synthase; hpl, hydroperoxide lyase; wt, wild type; n.d., not determined. the data represent between  <dig> and  <dig> independent experiments.

sequence alignments showed that both aos isoforms from p. patens contain the strictly conserved phe residue  in the active site. this residue is essential for aos activity by stabilizing the intermediately formed carbon-centered substrate radicals. in case of hpl this particular position is normally occupied by a leu residue. in contrast to phe this residue is unable to stabilize reactive product intermediates and thus leads to the formation of an unstable hemiacetal which decomposes spontaneously to short chain aldehydes  <cit> . consequently, incubation of 9-hpod with the respective ppaos <dig> variant, in which phe- <dig> was substituted by leu, resulted in an increased formation of 9-oxo nonanoic acid and a concomitant decrease in the amount of α-ketols . incubations with 13-hpod as well as with the respective hydroperoxy isomers of 18: <dig>  respectively, gave similar results , suggesting that this residue is an essential determinant for both 9- and 13-hydroperoxide dehydration. interestingly, sequence alignments demonstrated that pphpl also has a phe at this particular position. in order to analyze the significance of this residue for hpl activity, we substituted phe-  <dig> by leu. as shown in table  <dig> for all substrates tested, this variant showed an unaltered activity and formed a similar set of products as the wild type enzyme. a similar result was obtained when we substituted a conserved hpl-specific ala  in the active site by an aos-specific ser – a residue that additionally has been reported to determine aos activity. neither the single variant  nor the double variant  showed an altered catalytic specificity .

intercellular localization of ppaos <dig> and ppaos2
recently, pphpl was shown to be associated with plastidic membranes by transient expression of a pphpl-yfp fusion protein in p. patens protoplasts  <cit> . in line with this are bioinformatic analyses that predicted a plastidic transit peptide sequence at the n-terminus of pphpl. in neither ppaos <dig> nor ppaos <dig> a plastidic transit peptide sequence was identified using psort , targetp  or wolf psort . in order to analyze the intracellular localization of both aos isoforms, c- terminal yfp-fusions were generated and transiently expressed in p. patens gametophores. in case of ppaos <dig>  yfp fluorescence was distributed within the cytosol, whereas ppaos2-yfp co-localized with red chlorophyll auto fluorescence of chloroplasts . to confirm the localization results we also generated vectors for expression of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> with a c-terminal cfp-fusion and obtained similar results . in addition, we performed transient expression studies with all yfp and cfp fusion constructs in onion epidermis cells. we detected cytosolic localization for ppaos1-fusions, while for ppaos2-fusions fluorescence was observed only in granular structures of plastids . additional attempts to express ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> in p. patens protoplasts gave the same results . however, the analysis of the import of in vitro-translated ppaos <dig> and  <dig> protein into isolated pea protoplasts failed. thus, in contrast to most other cyp <dig> enzymes our results suggest that ppaos <dig> may be localized in the cytosol and only ppaos <dig> is localized within the plastid. it should be noted in this context, that similar to what was reported for pphpl  <cit> , ppaos <dig> may not be equally distributed in the chloroplast as a rather in-homogenous clustering of ppaos <dig> was observed.

analysis of p. patens Δppaos <dig> and Δppaos2- knock-out mutants
subsequently, the physiological role of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> was analyzed. former studies on Δppaoc knock-out mutants showed reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology and interrupted sporogenesis  <cit> . to investigate if the deletion of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> cause similar effects on reproduction in p. patens we generated targeted knock-out mutants of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> <cit> . two independent mutant lines with a disrupted ppaos <dig> locus  and five independent mutant lines with a disrupted ppaos <dig> locus  were identified by pcr. gametophores of all knockout lines were grown for four weeks under standard conditions which led to the formation of colonies. we did not observe any differences during vegetative growth compared to the wild type. in order to analyze the influence of both aos isoforms on the sporophyte formation, Δppaos <dig> and Δppaos <dig> mutants were grown under sporophyte-inducing conditions  <cit> . for neither of the mutants an effect on sporophyte development and sporogenesis was observed since mutant spores were able to germinate like spores from wild type. in order to analyze molecular consequences of the aos-disruption on the wound response of p. patens we analyzed the amount of cis-opda formed by the moss upon wounding. for this purpose we monitored cis-opda-accumulation in p. patens wt, Δppaos <dig> and Δppaos <dig> knock-out moss  <dig> h after a mechanical wounding stimulus employing lc/ms-analysis. shown in figure  <dig> are the results obtained for two independent experiments employing one line for each ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> knock-out. although the over-all amount of cis-opda differs in both experiments slightly, the obtained datasets demonstrate that the amount of cis-opda is comparable in both wt and Δppaos <dig>  while that found in Δppaos <dig> was decreased by a factor of 5– <dig> 

discussion
in the present study we aimed to analyze the biochemical and physiological properties of two aos isoforms from p. patens and compared those with that of a previously characterized cyp <dig> enzyme, pphpl  <cit> . for this purpose all three recombinant enzymes were purified from e. coli and their biochemical parameters were analyzed. in addition, the sub-cellular localization of both aos isoforms as well as the phenotype and the wound-induced cis-opda formation of Δppaos <dig> and Δppaos <dig> knock-out lines was investigated.

in initial experiments we analyzed products formed from ppaos <dig> and 9-hpod via lc/ms. as our kinetic measurements demonstrated that the kcat-values of incubations of ppaos <dig> with c18-derived substrates are much lower than that of other aos including ppaos <dig> , we aimed to verify that ppaos <dig> exhibits true aos activity and thus results in formation of aos products. as shown in figure  <dig>  these data demonstrate that like ppaos <dig> also ppaos <dig> exhibits aos-activity and forms unstable allene oxide derivatives that decompose in aqueous solution yielding different ketol-isomers. ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig> have a slightly acidic to neutral ph-optimum . recently, a similar ph-optimum was already determined for ppaos <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the ph-optima for both ppaos isoforms are consistent with that of the corresponding lox isoforms  <cit> , as the fatty acid hydroperoxide substrates for aos activity are typically provided by loxs  <cit> . the kinetic analyses of both aos isoforms demonstrated that ppaos <dig> can use both the 9- and 13-lox-derived hydroperoxides from 18: <dig>  18: <dig> and 18: <dig> as well as 20:4-derived 12-hpete as substrate with a similar specificity . notably, the kcat-values determined for those incubations are comparable with those reported for aos from other organisms  <cit> . analogous analyses with ppaos <dig> showed on the other hand that this enzyme exhibits only a very minor catalytic activity with all the used c18-derived substrates. with 12-hpete as substrate, however, ppaos <dig> showed a similar high activity as ppaos <dig> pointing to a distinct specificity of ppaos <dig> for c20–derived fatty acid hydroperoxides. this finding suggests that ppaos <dig> may specifically be involved in the eicosanoid pathway in p. patens <cit> .

recently, we found that similar to ppaos <dig> also pphpl can accept c18- as well as c20-derived hydroperoxides as substrates and convert them to short chain aldehydes and ω-oxo fatty acids. this enzyme, however, showed a preference for 9-hydroperoxides of c18-polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . interestingly, incubations of radio-labeled hydroperoxide isomers with both aos isoforms not only led to the formation of ketols but also of short chain -oxo fatty acids . ketols are typical aos products that are formed by non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the highly instable allene oxide product  <cit> . short chain -oxo fatty acids are, however, products that are specifically formed by the catalytic activity of hpl  <cit> . these results suggest that both ppaos isoforms possess an inherent hpl activity. this finding is in line with previous studies on rice and arabidopsis aos  <cit>  and reflects the close interconnection of the aos and hpl catalytic pathway  <cit> . in a recent study a molecular determinant that connects these two activities has been identified. it is hypothesized that a particular phe residue in the active site of aos plays a central role in catalysis by stabilizing an intermediary formed carbon centered substrate radical. mutational studies using ataos as a prototype enzyme showed that replacement of this residue by a hpl-specific leu is sufficient to convert an aos into a hpl  <cit> . however, until now this concept has only been evaluated by using ataos which has a preference for 13-hydroperoxide c18-fatty acids  <cit> . in order to analyze if this concept can also be applied on unspecific aos, we generated a ppaos <dig> variant with the respective phe to leu-substitution and analyzed the products formed by incubating purified protein with different 9- and 13-hydroperoxy c18-fatty acids as substrate. these data indeed showed that the ppaos1_phe93leu variant has prominent hpl activity with all used substrates suggesting a similar substrate positioning with respect to the conserved phe residue for both regio isomers in the wild type enzyme. we further evaluated whether the phe/leu-concept can also be applied on pphpl. sequence alignments showed that this particular aos determinant is indeed conserved among the members of the cyp74a-family  but interestingly also found in pphpl . based on the mechanism proposed for aos-catalysis we hypothesized that this phe residue in pphpl might stabilize an intermediary formed carbon-centered substrate radical which would lead to allene oxide formation. when we probed incubations of pphpl with different substrate isomers for aos and hpl products, we indeed found beside ω-oxo fatty acid derivatives  also small amounts of other products . among those we found both ketol isomers which might be formed by the inherent aos activity of pphpl. interestingly, we observed the α-ketol being formed in lower amounts compared to the γ-ketol . typically allene oxide hydrolysis leads to predominant formation of α-ketols while the amount of γ-ketols is significantly less  <cit> . however, grechkin and co-workers showed that the trajectory of this unspecific reaction is highly ph-dependent and γ-ketol formation is favored at acidic ph  <cit>  – reaction conditions that may apply to our experiments. the influence of this unusual phe- <dig> in pphpl on its product specificity was further analyzed. it is tempting to assume that substitution of aos-specific phe in hpl would increase hpl and decrease aos activity. however, experiments using the respective pphpl_phe151leu-variant showed an identical product pattern as for the wild-type enzyme. a similar result was obtained when a conserved hpl-specific ala  was replaced by an aos-specific ser. this determinant has been reported to determine aos/hpl activity as well. neither the single variant  nor the double variant  showed an altered catalytic specificity . these results suggest that in pphpl residues other than those reported to be essential for aos catalysis determine product specificity. as reported in supplemental material of  <cit> , a similar result was obtained before. here, an analogous enzyme variant of tomato hpl  exhibited only 5% aos activity.

recent studies showed that in contrast to flowering plants the moss p. patens may employ only the plastidic part of the oxylipin pathway, while the peroxisomal part is missing  <cit> . this observation is based on the findings that upon wounding or pathogen infection only cis-opda accumulated in the moss, but no ja could be detected. it was further supported by immunocytological investigations indicating the plastidic localization of all lox and aoc forms  <cit> . we here provide supporting evidence by showing that also ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid . surprisingly, however, ppaos <dig> appeared to be merely localized in the cytosol. as mentioned above aos products are highly unstable in aqueous solution and decompose within a few seconds either by non-enzymatic hydrolysis or spontaneous cyclization to ketols or cyclopentenones  <cit> . based on this finding and on the fact that natural occurring opda is enantiopure in the cis-configuration  <cit>  several studies discussed  a physical coupling of aos and aoc in vivo. although a later study demonstrated that no physical interaction of both enzymes in vitro is necessary in order to yield cis-opda  <cit> , it appeared highly questionable to us if cis-opda can be formed by the action of spatially separated ppaoc1/ <dig> and ppaos <dig>  on the other hand our kinetic analysis showed that ppaos <dig> has a distinct specificity for c20-derived substrates and thus may not be capable of providing the ppaocs with the substrate needed for cis-opda-formation. in order to tackle this issue we generated Δppaos <dig> and Δppaos <dig> knock-out mutants, analyzed the cis-opda accumulation upon wounding and compared these results with those obtained for the wild type strain. these analyses showed that formation of cis-opda was highly impaired by the disruption of ppaos <dig>  but not by the disruption of ppaos <dig>  while this fact therefore indeed indicates that in contrast to ppaos <dig>  ppaos <dig> plays a major role in the biosynthetic pathway of cis-opda and thus is in line with our kinetic data, the spatial separation of ppaos <dig> and ppaocs raises the question of how the unstable ppaos <dig> product is translocated from the cytosol to the plastid without being hydrolyzed. as mentioned previously  <cit>  the allene oxide might be protected from hydrolysis by an pure hydrophobic environment; thus one may speculate that aos products are imbedded into the membrane matrix in planta and are subsequently translocated by a so far unknown mechanism to the plastid where they may serve as substrate for ppaocs. a further question that is raised by the fact that both aos are differentially localized concerns the physiological function of those ppaoss. in flowering plants it has been shown that analogous knock-out mutants suffer from defective anther and pollen development and are thus male sterile  <cit>  or have defects in egg cell development and are thus female sterile  <cit> . in addition, previous studies on Δppaoc knock-out mutants showed in analogy to studies in flowering plants  <cit> , that reduction of cis-opda biosynthesis leads to reduced fertility, aberrant sporophyte morphology or interrupted sporogenesis  <cit> . in contrast, neither the Δppaos <dig> nor the Δppaos <dig> knock-out mutants described here showed any obviously deviating phenotype in growth or sporophyte development. while this finding is consistent with the cytosolic localization of ppaos <dig>  it is surprising that deletion of ppaos <dig> also did not show any phenotypic effect. thus, the finding that each aos knock-out mutants show no aberrant phenotype suggests that cis-opda is still being synthesized in sufficient amounts. on the one hand this may be explained by overlapping functions of ppaos <dig> and ppaos <dig>  however as only ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid and thus can provide ppaocs with allene oxide substrate, a redundant function of both enzymes appears to be unlikely. also, a careful re-investigation of the genome did not reveal a further potential aos-sequence. on the other hand, an inherent aos activity was observed for pphpl. considering the high substrate turnover of pphpl  <cit> , its aos side activity may still be efficient enough to provide sufficient amount of allene oxide product for formation of cis-opda by ppaoc. in line with this assumption goes the plastidic localization of pphpl  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we found that both aos isoforms from p. patens are capable of metabolizing c <dig> and c20-derived fatty acid hydroperoxides with different specificities suggesting that both enzymes might have different substrate pools. in line with that, only ppaos <dig> is localized in the plastid where oxylipin metabolism takes place and ppaos <dig> was detected in the cytosol. surprisingly, however, only disruption of ppaos <dig> affected wound response and led to an decreased formation of cis-opda. furthermore, knock-out mutants of neither aos showed an aberrant phenotype suggesting that there are overlapping functions with the other cyp <dig> enzyme, pphpl. this is supported by site directed mutagenesis experiments. these revealed that the catalytic trajectories of substrate unspecific ppaos <dig> and pphpl are closely inter-connected and can be inter-converted by single amino acid exchanges.
