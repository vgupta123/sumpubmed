BACKGROUND
since the discovery of newly generated neurons in the fully developed mammalian brain  <cit> , research on adult neurogenesis has become one of the major goals of neuroscience. under unperturbed conditions, postnatal neurogenesis is particularly important in two well-defined anatomical regions of the central nervous system : the subventricular zone  lining the lateral walls of the anterior lateral ventricles; and the subgranular zone  of the dentate gyrus  of the hippocampus . the neural stem cells  stored within these neurogenic niches continuously self-renew and differentiate into multiple neural lineages, thus allowing the equilibrium between cell loss and cell replacement while maintaining the nsc pool  <cit> . in addition, accumulating evidence indicates that increased postnatal neurogenesis may be also observed in response to acute injury to the cns, thus suggesting that new neurons may be generated in order to replace those lost owing to tissue wound and therefore contribute to the healing .

however, regardless of the time elapsed since the first discovery of postnatal mammalian neurogenesis, key information is still lacking about the regulatory mechanisms controlling the self-renewal and differentiation processes  <cit> . postnatal neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated by a number of extrinsic factors such as pharmacological stimuli, an enriched environment or physical exercise  <cit> . in addition, postnatal neurogenesis is regulated by numerous hormones, among which the growth hormone -insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  system seems to play a pivotal role  <cit> . the existence of important neurogenic  actions of gh in the adult brain has been demonstrated both in humans and laboratory animals . furthermore, gh has been shown to potentiate the neurogenesis induced in response to brain injury , thus leading to the possibility of using the hormone in the treatment of some neural diseases. however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the neurogenic actions of gh, although they may depend, at least in part, on the stimulation of the proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural precursors. therefore, this study was designed to investigate to role of gh in the regulation of the proliferation and survival of cultured neurospheres obtained from the dg of postnatal mice, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying those effects.

RESULTS
establishment and characterization of sgz-derived neurosphere cultures
sgz-derived neurospheres obtained from neonatal  mice were able to grow and give rise to new neurospheres upon passaging, thus demonstrating their capacity of self-renewal . in addition, these neurospheres were able to generate either gfap- nestin- or o4-positive cells upon differentiation . by using a polyclonal anti-ghr antibody we found the presence of ghr immunoreactivity in cells co-expressing either nestin  or gfap . in contrast, we have been unable to find ghr immunoreactivity in o4-positive cells . gh immunoreactivity was also observed in neurosphere cells co-expressing gfap .figure  <dig>

gh treatment promotes the proliferation and survival of sgz-derived neurospheres
treatment of sgz-derived neurospheres with gh resulted in a significant increase in the amount of brdu incorporation ; an effect that was prevented by treating the cells with the ghr antagonist pegvisomant. since pegvisomant hinders the binding of gh to its receptor, this finding demonstrates that gh-induced proliferation depends on stimulation of ghr. interestingly, a significant decline in the proliferation of neurosphere cultures was also observed when pegvisomant was given alone  . in contrast with these findings, gh was ineffective in promoting neurosphere proliferation when was given in the absence of egf and fgf .

in addition to promote proliferation, gh treatment was able to significantly reduce the apoptosis in neurosphere cultures . in order to induce cell death, neurosphere cultures were placed in media devoid of egf and fgf. under these experimental conditions, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased with regard to cells growing in defined media , but this was counteracted by treating the cells with gh . also in this case, the gh effect was prevented by treating the cells with pegvisomant, thus demonstrating the involvement of ghr. in concordance with the effect of pegvisomant on cell proliferation, a significant increase in apoptotic cell death was also observed when pegvisomant was given alone .figure  <dig>

role of the ras-erk signaling pathway in the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of gh
the importance of erk phosphorylation in transducing gh actions has been previously demonstrated in different cell types  <cit> . therefore, in order to investigate the involvement of this signaling pathway in sgz-derived neurosphere cultures, we treated them with u <dig>  a highly specific inhibitor of mek1/ <dig> that effectively blocks erk phosphorylation. blockade of ras-erk signaling not only resulted in a prominent inhibition of neurosphere proliferation , but completely blocked the positive effect of gh on cell proliferation. similarly, u <dig> treatment induced a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells, although in this case, the effect was partially counteracted by gh treatment . surprisingly, and in contrast with previous reports  <cit> , we have been unable to find any effect of gh on erk phosphorylation in cultured sgz neurospheres .figure  <dig>

role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /akt/mtor signaling pathway in the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of gh
the role of the pi-3 k/akt/mtor pathway in gh signaling has been also supported by several previous observations  <cit> . activation of ghr induces the phosphorylation of the ghr-associated protein insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  which, in turn, activates pi-3 k that promotes akt phosphorylation. in keeping with those findings, gh treatment induced a prompt and marked rise in phospho-akt levels in sgz-derived neurospheres . once phosphorylated, akt activates the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase- <dig>  that, in turns, phosphorylates a number of intracellular targets including mtor  <cit>  which, reportedly, plays a major role in the regulation of proliferation and survival in different types of cells  <cit> . therefore, in order to assess the involvement of the pi-3 k/akt/mtor pathway on gh actions, we first treated neurosphere cultures with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mtor complex  <dig> . as figure 5c depicts, treatment with rapamycin significantly reduced the proliferation of neurosphere cultures, and completely abolished the effect of gh. interestingly rapamycin also induced a significant increase in cell death but, in this case, the effect was partially counteracted by gh . in order to further investigate the involvement on akt stimulation of this effect, cells were also treated with ly <dig>  a potent inhibitor of pi-3 k. in keeping with previous results in other cell types  <cit> , inhibition of akt phosphorylation significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells  while, as occurred with rapamycin treatment, gh was able to partially overcome this effect .figure  <dig> 
the pi-3 k/akt pathway is involved in the antiapoptotic affect of gh. a) neurospheres were deposited for 48 h in slides with defined media without egf and fgf <dig>  and then treated with gh for 1 h. phospho akt and gapdh immunoreactivities were determined by western blot. b) densitometric evaluation of results presented in a. phospho akt levels are expressed as arbitrary densitometric units and normalized to gapdh levels. c) neurospheres growing in defined media were treated for 24 h with saline , gh , rapamycin , or gh + rapamycin. four hours before the end of the treatment period cells were given a brdu pulse . neurospheres were then dissociated and cells were collected by centrifugation onto coated cover slips, and brdu was detected by immunocytochemistry. * = p < <dig>  vs control; ** = p < <dig>  vs control and gh. d) and e) neurospheres were placed into culture plates containing defined media without egf and fgf <dig>  and 24 h later treated for  <dig> h with saline, gh, rapamycin or gh + rapamycin,  or saline, gh, ly  <dig>  or gh + ly  <dig>  . * = p <  <dig>  vs control; ** = p < <dig>  vs control and p < <dig>  vs gh; ° = p < <dig>  vs gh. in d) and e) basal apoptosis, determined by growing the cells in the defined media , was significantly lower  than in the other groups. e = egf; f = fgf <dig>  bars = mean + sem of  <dig> experiments in triplicate.



gh-induced jnk phosphorylation is involved in the antiapoptotic effects of gh
finally, we investigated the role of jnk in mediating the effects of gh on neurosphere proliferation and survival. in keeping with previous findings in fibroblasts  <cit>  or macrophages  <cit> , gh was able to induce the phosphorylation of jnk in cultured neurospheres . when jnk actions were counteracted by treating the cells with sp <dig>  a competitive inhibitor of its kinase activity, both proliferation and survival were significantly decreased in neurosphere cultures . interestingly, none of these effects could be counteracted by gh treatment.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study was designed to investigate the role of gh on postnatal neurogenesis using a neurosphere culture system. the presence of ongoing neurogenesis in the postnatal mammalian brain, together with the prospect that the stem cell pools present in the adult brain can be directed towards repair of neural injuries has generated much interest for the last several years, see  <cit>  for review. furthermore, since postnatal neurogenesis is regulated by a complex network of signaling molecules and extrinsic factors  <cit> , understanding these mechanisms of control will help to find effective treatments directed towards increase neurogenesis in order to promote brain repair.

gh has been proposed to play a role on brain repair after injury  <cit> . although some of the beneficial effects of gh on brain repair may depend on their neuroprotective actions  <cit> , there is also accumulating evidence indicating that neurogenesis is also stimulated by gh. thus gh treatment has been demonstrated to promote neurogenesis in different brain areas  <cit>  either under unperturbed conditions  <cit>  or in response to brain damage  <cit> . interestingly, gh-induced neurogenesis is potentiated when gh treatment is combined with physical exercise  <cit>  or physical rehabilitation  <cit> , thus suggesting that the hormone is not only cooperating with endogenous mechanisms regulating postnatal neurogenesis, but may be even essential to induce the neurogenic response  <cit> . there is also evidence indicating that gh increases the frequency of both rodent- and human-derived neurospheres in vitro ; and the present study], thus demonstrating a direct effect of gh on neural precursor cells. furthermore, in all these cases, gh actions are lost when ghr is absent or inactivated, thus indicating that gh actions are exerted via activation of ghr; although the possibility that some of gh actions on neural precursors may depend on the activation of other receptors cannot be ruled out  <cit> .

once established the importance of gh in the regulation of proliferation and survival of sgz-derived neurospheres, we next investigated the molecular mechanism underlying these actions. the predominant gh signal transduction cascade comprises activation of the ghr dimer and phosphorylation of janus kinase  <dig> . activated jak <dig> then phosphorylates key tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domain of the ghr, permitting sh <dig> domain interactions by signal adaptor proteins that results in docking of signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  for activation by jak <dig>  <cit> . the triggering of this canonical signaling pathway has been recently demonstrated in neurosphere cells  <cit> , and may be involved in some of the gh actions on these cells. however, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the ghr also results in the activation of the ras/mapk kinase/erk pathway; while activated jak <dig> is also able to directly phosphorylate irs-1/ <dig>  facilitating activation of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway  <cit> .

our findings demonstrate that at least two of those signaling pathways, the pi-3 k/akt/mtor and jnk module of the mapk, are activated by gh in cultured neurospheres, thus illustrating the complexity of ghr signaling in these cells. furthermore, by using selective inhibitors we have been able to demonstrate that, despite these signaling pathways may be important in mediating the gh effects on cell proliferation, they appear to exert a more essential role in the regulation of cell survival. there are several types of evidences supporting our hypothesis. first, gh was able to partially overcome the effect of erk inhibition on cell survival, while its effect on cell proliferation was completely abrogated under these circumstances. the ability of gh to promote cell survival in the absence of erk signaling indicates that gh is able to deliver a survival signal that is independent on ras/erk pathway activation. in contrast, ras/erk signaling is necessary for the gh effect on neurosphere proliferation indicating that, in keeping with previous reports  <cit> , gh is neither sufficient nor necessary for neurosphere proliferation.

second, gh treatment also partially counteracted the negative effect of rapamycin on cell survival, but did not modify rapamycin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. interestingly, mtor has been shown to be relevant for egf-dependent proliferation of neural precursors  <cit> , further supporting our hypothesis regarding a minor role of gh on the regulation of neurosphere proliferation. furthermore, mtor is present in two distinct complexes: mtor complex  <dig>  and mtor complex  <dig>   <cit> . since only mtorc <dig> is inhibited by rapamycin, the possibility exists that gh actions on cell survival may depend, at least in part, on the rapamycin-insensitive mtorc <dig> complex, as occurs with insulin  <cit> . another possible mechanism, not excluding the former, is that gh may overcome the effect of rapamycin treatment via the stimulation of survival signals that do not depend on the pi-3 k/akt/mtor pathway. in this regard, it is interesting to indicate that the ability of gh to prevent apoptosis was preserved in the presence of pi-3 k inhibition, thus suggesting that akt activation does not play a major anti-apoptotic role in these cells.

in contrast with these findings, gh effects on both cell proliferation and survival were completely inhibited when the phosphorylation of jnk was blocked. jnks are members of the mapk family that are activated by a variety of environmental stresses, inflammatory cytokines and, in some instances, by growth factors and gpcr  agonists  <cit> . once activated, the jnk pathway regulates numerous cellular responses including cell proliferation and survival, together with different aspects of neural development . therefore, the fact that blockade of jnk signaling completely inhibited both the proliferation and survival of svz-derived neurospheres, indicates that this pathway plays a major role in the regulation of the cellular fate of these cells. furthermore, the fact that both gh-induced proliferation and survival are also blocked under these experimental conditions, together with the ability of gh to promote jnk phosphorylation, indicates that the jnk pathway is a key component of the signaling machinery activated by gh in svz-derived neurospheres. to our knowledge, this is the first time to demonstrate the capacity of gh to induce the phosphorylation of jnk in neural cells. to the present, gh-induced jnk phosphorylation has been demonstrated in macrophages  <cit> , in nih 3 t <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> , and also in chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with rat gh receptor cdna  <cit> . however, gh has been shown to reduce both basal and doxorubicin-stimulated jnk transcriptional activity and phosphorylation in both mda-mb- <dig> and mcf <dig> cells  <cit> , thus demonstrating the complexity of gh-mediated jnk regulation.

finally, it is noteworthy to indicate that blockade of gh signaling was able to induce a decrease in neurosphere proliferation and survival even in cells not receiving gh treatment. this finding, together with the existence of gh expression in cultured neurospheres , suggests the existence of an endogenous gh axis regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of neural progenitors. up to now, the existence of gh immunoreactivity has been reported in several brain areas that include germinal regions of the embryonic brain  <cit> , as well as brain regions involved in postnatal neurogenesis . furthermore, gh gene expression within these areas is increased by factors known to increase neurogenesis such as learning, exercise or estrogen administration , while such increase is not observed in ghr-/- animals . altogether, these findings lead to the possibility that gh treatment is, in fact, cooperating with locally-produced gh in increasing the proliferation of neural progenitors in response to adequate stimuli. in this regard, it is interesting to note that we have previously found that gh is expressed in rat hippocampal progenitors, and that gh expression increases after neurotoxic damage . therefore, it is tempting to speculate that, this locally-produced gh may cooperate with the exogenous hormone in promoting neurogenesis and cell survival in response to brain injury.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, these findings lead to the possibility that gh treatment is, in fact, cooperating with locally-produced gh in increasing the proliferation and survival of neural progenitors in response to adequate stimuli. in this regard, the fact that increased gh expression has been detected in hippocampal progenitors after neurotoxic damage  <cit>  suggests that endogenous and exogenous gh may also cooperate in promoting neurogenesis and cell survival in response to brain injury.
