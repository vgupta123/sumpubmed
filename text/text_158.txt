BACKGROUND
mitochondria, as semiautonomous organelles, function as manufacturers of cellular atp through the process of oxidative phosphorylation in all eukaryotes. it is believed that mitochondria originated from a free-living eubacterial ancestor and became an endosymbiotic organelle through engulfment by a eukaryotic host cell  <cit> . the sizes of mitochondrial genomes  vary among eukaryotes, ranging from  <dig> kb in plasmodium to 200- <dig> kb in higher plants  <cit> . due to frequent mtdna recombination and extraneous dna incorporation from the chloroplast  and nuclear genomes, extensive size expansion of mtdna in higher plants occurs very frequently. in higher plants, in addition to their large genome sizes, mtdnas display distinctive features, including slow evolutionary rate, rapid rearrangement, frequent insertion, complex multipartite structure, specific mode of gene expression, cis-/trans-splicing, rna editing, and use of the universal genetic code  <cit> . in higher plants, protein-coding genes in mtdna are extremely conserved but their gene order and non-protein-coding sequences are rather variable  <cit> , and their structural organization is very dynamic  <cit> . the dynamic multipartite structures in higher plants exhibit redundancy and copy number variation  <cit> . gene shuffling and variations may result in different phenotypes, such as cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> .

cms is a common phenotype in higher plants, and is closely associated with mutations in mtdnas that cause pollen abortion. cms systems have been widely used as a convenient way to produce f <dig> hybrid seeds in a variety of valuable crop species, including rice, maize, sugar beet, and cotton. in addition, cms is exploited to study nucleocytoplasmic interactions  <cit> . mtdnas in higher plants are known to have the ability to undergo extensive recombination, resulting in sequence rearrangements. when these rearrangements produce "chimeric genes", they may directly or indirectly alter normal physiological functions, such as pollen abortion. therefore, comparative analysis of mtdnas between a cms line and its normal fertile counterpart should lead to the molecular details underlying the sterility phenotype in higher plants.

wheat k-type cms, which lacks adverse cytoplasmic effects and has more restoration line resources than other types of cms, has been widely used in the production of hybrid seeds. moreover, we recently sequenced the complete mtdna genome for fertile yumai  <dig> , which is a maintainer line of k-type cms  <cit> . in this study, we acquired and analyzed another complete mtdna from a wheat k-type cms line, ks <dig>  with the sterilizing cytoplasm derived from aegilops kotschyi, boiss.

RESULTS
organization of ks <dig> mtdna
we acquired the ks <dig> mtdna sequence by exploiting a bac-based cloning strategy, which yielded a circular molecule  <dig>  bp in length with  <dig> % g+c content . in this master circle  molecule, there were four large repeat sequences of more than  <dig> kb. the largest was  <dig>  bp, extending from  <dig> to  <dig>  including  <dig> genes . the actual ks <dig> mtdna was  <dig> kb as estimated by removing one copy each of the large repeats with more than  <dig> bp from the mc molecule. we used similarity searches  and found  <dig> genes in total; among them, we identified  <dig> known protein-coding genes, three rrnas , and  <dig> trnas, accounting for  <dig> % of the genome . in addition, using sequence analysis, we classified  <dig> orfs longer than  <dig> bp, which summed to  <dig> % or  <dig>  bp in total.

we also analyzed the transposable elements in ks <dig> mtdna using tigr's transposable element database as a reference http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/plant.repeats/index.shtml with a minimum match of  <dig> bp. the results showed that there were  <dig> small fragments, ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, that were identical to known retrotransposons . ten retrotransposons were identical to those of rice and the remaining retrotransposons were identical to those of wheat, with identities ranging from 79% to 98%. the overall length of the retrotransposons was  <dig> bp,  <dig> % of the total ks <dig> mtdna.

ks3-specific mtdna regions
we compared ks <dig> mtdna with that of km <dig> using blast <dig>  and the analysis revealed  <dig>  shared base pair, i.e.,  <dig> % of the total km <dig> sequence. in addition, ks <dig> mtdna had a  <dig> -bp sequence that was homologous to km <dig> mtdna, accounting for  <dig> % of the total. the conserved sequences in km <dig> and ks <dig> were broken into  <dig> and  <dig> sequence segments, respectively. we also revealed  <dig> segments  of more than  <dig> bp in ks <dig> mtdna that were not maintained in km <dig> mtdna  and totaled  <dig>  bp , ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and interspersed over  <dig> locations in the ks <dig> mc molecule. it is notable that there were multiple copies in some specific regions. for example, there were four copies of u <dig>  and three copies each of unique regions of u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  other unique regions had double or single copies. in the following description, the sum of the length of different specific regions includes every copy unless stated otherwise.

we annotated these  <dig> ks3-specific sequences using blastn and blastx searching against ncbi databases. four integrated segments, u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  were found in the databases with a total of  <dig> bp, while  <dig> segments  could not be detected, and  <dig> segments were partially annotated in  <dig> pieces . as a result,  <dig>  bp were explained, accounting for  <dig> % of ks3-specific sequences and 4% of the ks <dig> mitochondrial genome. furthermore,  <dig> ks3-specific segments , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, were homologous to several previously determined mitochondrial sequences in higher plants, e.g., zea mays, sorghum bicolor, oryza sativa, bambusa oldhamii, and tripsacum dactyloides. in addition, partial segments  in u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> were found to be significantly homologous to wheat chloroplast dna. five segments, u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  partially matched several nuclear genome sequences of different higher plants. nevertheless, ks3-specific regions, which accounted for about  <dig>  bp and  <dig> % of ks <dig> mtdna, were novel to the current ncbi databases.

homology of ks <dig> mtdna to wheat ctdna
we analyzed homology between ks <dig> mtdna and the wheat chloroplast genome  using blast <dig>  and revealed  <dig> segments  with more than 81% identity  and a size range of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. thirty-eight of these segments were more than  <dig> bp in length, and summed to  <dig>  bp  .

we noticed that some segments in ks <dig> mtdna were homologous to wheat ctdna with multiple copies; ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> were duplicated and ct <dig> has four copies. fifty-six segments covered the full length or parts of known genes; six segments contained trna genes derived from ctdna . the other  <dig> fragments were classified into  <dig> mtdna-derived genes : atp <dig>  rrn18- <dig>  rrn18- <dig>  rrn18- <dig>  rrn18- <dig>  rrn26- <dig>  rrn26- <dig>  trnm- <dig>  and trnm- <dig>  corresponding to wheat ctdna genes atpa, rrn <dig>  rrn <dig>  and ct-trnm.

in addition, by comparing the wheat ctdna homologies to ks <dig> mtdna with wheat ctdna homologies to km <dig> mtdna, we observed that most of these homologies with ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdna were identical. only two homologous segments  between wheat ctdna and km <dig> mtdna were not shared with ks <dig> mtdna. similarly, four segments  in ks <dig> mtdna were uniquely homologous with wheat ctdna, and were located in ks3-specific mtdna regions, u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> . additional file  <dig> also indicates that these unique homologous segments of ks <dig> mtdna and wheat ctdna were contained in ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct24r. the results reveal that the mitochondrial genomes of ks <dig> and km <dig> may incorporate some specific extraneous dna from the wheat chloroplast genome.

ks <dig> mtdna repeat sequences
the mtdnas of higher plants harbor massive repeated sequences. in the ks <dig> mtdna, we defined  <dig> repeats , comprising both direct  and inverted repeats  ; among them, nine involved two copies, twelve had three copies, and six had four copies. there were four large repeats, r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  which exceeded  <dig> kb, with lengths of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively. other repeats were smaller in size and had distinct distributions and copy number variations .

b boldface: ir copy, compared with copy- <dig> as control.

e idy: identity.

plant mtdna is known to contain multipartite structures  <cit> . the isomeric forms of the mc molecule and subgenomic circles are decipherable based on assumptions of intra-molecular homologous recombination  <cit> . we produced various molecular forms of the ks <dig> mc molecule by intra-molecular recombination between different repeat pairs, including three dr of more than  <dig> kb and four ir of more than 8-kb . other repeat pairs may also produce possible sites for additional recombination. these subgenomic structures are real. for tobacco mtdna, subgenomic circles were directly observed using electron microscopy  <cit> , and sugiyama et al.  <cit>  proved that long-range pcr could be used to test recombinant molecules formed by inter-molecule recombination.

moreover, we also compared repeats between ks <dig> mtdna and km <dig> mtdna. it is known that the km <dig> mtdna sequence is almost identical to the previously reported sequence of t. aestivum cv. chinese spring, except for seven single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> indels   <cit> . as a result, km <dig> mtdna and chinese spring mtdna have almost identical repeats . we found that four repeats  were almost identical in the two mitochondrial genomes; r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> in ks <dig> mtdna corresponded to r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> in km <dig> mtdna. ten repeats were specific to ks <dig> mtdna and there were six specific repeats in km <dig> mtdna . as shown in additional file  <dig> the relationship between the large repeats in km <dig> and ks <dig> mtdna is complicated. four large repeats, r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig>  in ks <dig> mtdna were much bigger than the corresponding repeats in km <dig> mtdna. r <dig> and r <dig> of km <dig> showed homology to a fragment located at one end of r <dig> in ks <dig> mtdna. the two ends of r <dig> of km <dig> were also homologous to the two ends of r <dig> of ks <dig>  whereas the central fragment of r <dig> of km <dig> displayed no homology to the repeats of ks <dig>  a majority of r <dig> of km <dig> was homologous to r <dig> of ks <dig>  but it was split in two locations.

protein-coding and rna genes between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas
the cytoplasm of km <dig> and ks <dig> originated from common wheat and aegilops kotschyi belongs to two different genera, triticum and aegilops, respectively. most of the protein-coding genes are highly conserved, especially in size, except atp <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  and rps19-p . for instance, the 5'-end of ksapt <dig> and kmatp <dig> is conserved but the 3'-end of ksapt <dig> is extended by  <dig> bp. another example is nad9: due to deletion of four bases  upstream of ksnad <dig>  its orf is  <dig> bp shorter than that of kmnad <dig>  an extreme case is rpsl <dig>  which is absent in ks <dig> but present in km <dig>  a dna exchange between mtdna and nuclear dna might have occurred, resulting in a nuclear rps <dig> protein, if the rps <dig> protein is proven to exist; otherwise, we have a defective ks <dig> mitochondrial ribosome without rpl <dig> 

we identified  <dig> snps scattered among  <dig> protein-coding genes:  <dig> were synonymous  and  <dig> were non-synonymous . most of these variations were actually transversions rather than the expected transitions. it is also remarkable that, when compared with km <dig>  many variations were found among ribosomal protein-coding genes, such as ksrps <dig>  ksrps <dig>  ksrps <dig>  and ksrps <dig>  these non-synonymous changes in protein sequences are candidates for functional scrutiny in searching for molecular mechanisms of cms, since protein-coding genes in plant mtdna are extraordinarily conservative and their evolutionary rate is very low among different types of plants  <cit> .

c s, synonymous; n, non-synonymous.

a majority of rrna and trna genes were highly conserved between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas. both, however, had missing sequences: ks <dig> lost trna and km <dig> lost trnh. a similar case was also seen among rrnas. for instance, ks <dig> mtdna did not include ksrrn26-p. moreover, there were more genes and exons in ks <dig> than in km <dig> mtdna, as several large-sized repeats were unique to ks <dig> mtdna.

orfs between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas
since novel orfs may be relevant to cms  <cit> , we classified all possible orfs in the km <dig> and ks <dig> mtdna. we found  <dig> in km <dig> and  <dig> in ks <dig> with a length equal to or greater than  <dig> bp. the additional orfs in ks <dig> reflect the greater length of the ks <dig> mtdna. in addition to copy number and length variations, we also found some orfs that were unique to ks <dig>  based on blast <dig> searches . among them, six  were novel; a database search performed with the blast network service using default parameters revealed no homologies to other sequences in the ncbi databases. two orfs , which were situated in two ks3-specific mtdna regions , showed significant homology to wheat chloroplast dna. as mentioned above, two ks <dig> mtdna fragments homologous to wheat ctdna were unique and not found in km <dig> mtdna. this indicates that ksorf <dig> and ksorf <dig> were probably derived from an extraneous wheat chloroplast genome. another pair of orfs, ksorf <dig> and ksorf <dig>  located in a ks <dig> mtdna unique region, u <dig>  exhibited homology to a dna polymerase in rye mtdna. this result indicates that ksorf <dig> and ksorf <dig> likely encode proteins with similar function in ks <dig> mtdna, but further empirical data are needed. it is notable that ksorf <dig> in ks <dig> mtdna is homologous to orf <dig>  a candidate for a sterile gene associated with wheat t-cms, which originated from the transfer of the wheat nuclear counterpart into triticum timopheevii cytoplasm. in wheat t-cms, the chimeric gene orf <dig> is situated upstream of cox <dig>  is transcribed together with cox <dig>  and expresses a 7-kda protein that is not found in fertile lines  <cit> . our data showed that ksorf <dig> resembled orf <dig> upstream of kscox <dig>  and deserves further study. previous studies have shown that the orfs involved in cms are usually located in the vicinity of known genes or form a chimeric gene by overlapping with parts of known genes in the plant mitochondrial genome. for example, urf13-t which leads to cms in maize t-cms is located downstream of atp <dig>  which provides the regulatory sequence, and the two are co-transcribed  <cit> . similarly, orf <dig>  the cms gene in sorghum a3-cms, forms a chimeric sequence by partially overlapping the 5'-end with that of atp <dig>  <cit> . some of the ks3-specific ksorfs have similar structures to known orfs involved in cms in other plant mtdnas .

b orfs are entirely or partially located in the corresponding unique regions of km <dig> mtdna.

* these orfs do not show significant homology to km <dig> mtdna.

we also categorized ks3-specific orfs into two basic groups: those that were partially homologous to km <dig> mtdna  and those that were almost entirely homologous to km <dig> mtdna . partial segments of seven orfs  were located in corresponding ks3-specific regions, whereas another sequence of these orfs was homologous to km <dig> mtdna . in addition, with the exception of ksorf <dig>  these orfs were located in ks <dig> mtdna repeat regions . as shown in figure 5b and 5d, five orfs  had remarkable homology to km <dig> mtdna, but homologous km <dig> mtdna were divided into two discrete segments in the km <dig> mitochondrial genome, which indicates that they are likely derived from different parts of km <dig> mtdna. it is notable that five orfs were not situated in repeat regions of ks <dig> mtdna .

comparison among angiosperm mtdnas
we used multipipmaker to align similar regions in two or more dna sequences using one of the dna sequences as a reference; in our study, ks <dig> mtdna was used as the reference unless stated otherwise. comparing ks <dig> mtdna to those of km <dig>  rice, maize, arabidopsis thaliana, and rapeseed , we noticed several interesting features. first, the alignable ks <dig> sequence  was 83% identical to that of km <dig> mtdna. for a more distant sequence comparison, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ks <dig> mtdna matched those of maize and rice with an identity of more than 78%, respectively. only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ks <dig> mtdna was shared with arabidopsis thaliana and rapeseed, at more than 76% identity, respectively, and the longest fragment was only  <dig> kb. nevertheless, due to greater evolutionary pressure, coding sequences in angiosperm mtdna are more conservative, whereas the non-coding parts are highly divergent   <cit> .

we also compared the copy number of mitochondrial genes among ks <dig>  km <dig>  maize, and rice . ks <dig> mtdna appeared to have the most multi-copy genes, in contrast to km <dig> mtdna, in which only atp <dig> and atp <dig> had two copies. ribosomal protein-coding genes and trna genes appeared to be more divergent among angiosperm mtdnas. for example, rice and km <dig> mtdnas contained rpl <dig> but maize and ks <dig> mtdnas did not. ksrpl <dig>  ksrps <dig>  kmrpl <dig>  and kmrps <dig>  as truncated pseudogenes, were not complete orfs, whereas rpl <dig> and rps <dig> in rice mtdna included complete orfs; however, maize mtdna did not include these sequences. moreover, km <dig> and maize possessed trna in their mtdnas, but ks <dig> and rice did not.

we also compared gene order in ks <dig> mtdna to that in km <dig>  maize, and rice mtdna, excluding trna genes . first, rrn <dig> and rrn <dig> were inserted into the nad5c-nad1e-matr-rps1-ccmfn cluster shared by other grass mtdnas to form a new cluster unique to ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas. second,  <dig> clusters were found to be syntenic in ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas. third, ks <dig> mtdna shared four two-gene clusters, rrn5-rnn <dig>  nad3-rps <dig>  rps13-nad1bc, and nad9-nad2cde, with rice and maize mtdnas. fourth, ks <dig> mtdna shared four two-gene clusters, rps3a-rpl <dig>  rnn26-cox <dig>  nad6-rps <dig> and atp1-cox2ab, with maize alone. fifth, three other two-gene clusters, rpl16-rps3b, nad4l-rps <dig>  and nad5ab-rpl <dig>  were common only to ks <dig> and rice mtdnas but not to maize mtdna. these variations in gene order were readily identified by syntenic analysis.

discussion
comparative analysis of km <dig> and ks <dig> mtdnas
the ks <dig> mc molecule was  <dig> kb larger than that of km3; ks <dig> had additional long repeat elements--four of them were more than  <dig> kb in size--and the longest repeat was  <dig>  bp in length. similar results were also reported in tk18-ms, a cytoplasmic male sterile line of sugar beet, which contains a pair of repeats of  <dig>  bp in its mc molecule  <cit> . although repeat content of mtdna can account for more than 30% of total genome sequence length, as in indica rice 93- <dig>  where repeats greater than  <dig> kb in size constitute  <dig> % of the total mtdna  <cit> , the size of mtdnas of cytoplasmic male sterile lines seems to be dramatically larger than that of maintainer lines. the intergenic region of plant mtdnas often contains retrotransposons transferred from nuclear and chloroplast genomes  <cit> . ks <dig> mtdna again had more retrotransposons than km3:  <dig> vs.  <dig>  however, the percentages of these retrotransposons in both ks <dig> and km <dig> were not as high as in maize mtdna, where retrotransposons account for  <dig> % of the total genome  <cit> , but where the rate of gene transfer is generally deemed low  <cit> .

frequent recombination events have distorted the synteny between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas , as also seen among other plant mtdnas  <cit> . ks <dig> mtdna had  <dig> % unique sequences when compared to km <dig> mtdna;  <dig> % of ks <dig> mtdna sequences are novel but most of these are located in intergenic regions that show a faster rate of evolution  <cit> . furthermore, although many gene sequences were highly conserved between the two genomes, there were exceptions. rpl <dig> was missing in ks <dig>  and the sequences of atp <dig>  nad <dig>  and nad <dig> between km <dig> and ks <dig> mtdnas were very different. in addition, the number of snps between the ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas was also significant, compared to those in a cms line of sugar beet , which has  <dig> snps in  <dig> protein-coding genes compared to the fertile form  <cit> . finally, there were  <dig> orfs unique to ks <dig> mtdna. these differences in protein-coding sequences between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas are good candidates for contributing to the cms phenotype.

structural diversity among plant mtdnas
our analysis of structural diversity is necessary to understanding the sequence diversity among plant mtdnas  <cit> . we detected  <dig> repeats of more than  <dig> bp in ks <dig> mtdna, including direct repeats  and inverted repeats , and their roles in shaping subgenomic and isomeric structures in ks <dig> mtdna are of importance. it is believed that proteins encoded by nuclear genes are involved in mismatch repair and recombination of mtdnas. a gene, msh <dig>  in the nuclear genome homologous to the escherichia coli muts mismatch repair component, reca <dig>  affects structural diversity in a. thaliana  <cit> . in maize, the p <dig> nuclear genotype is used as a system for understanding mutations in mtdna, where abnormal recombination products remarkably increase as the copy number of subgenomic molecules of maize mtdna increases  <cit> . research has shown that when the gene homologous to msh <dig> in tobacco and tomato is knocked out by rnai, novel mitochondrial genome organizations are observed, and plants show a male sterility phenotype  <cit> .

molecular mechanisms of wheat k-type cms
we conducted extensive sequence comparison between ks <dig> and km <dig> mtdnas to search for functional alterations of genes that were responsible for the cms phenotype in plants. we noticed that ks <dig> mtdna encodes several partial subunits of the respiratory chain complex, including atp <dig>  atp <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  cox <dig>  and cox <dig> . any of these altered proteins may interfere with the normal function of respiratory chain reactions, weakening energy supplies and stalling pollen development  <cit> . in addition, we also observed amino acid variations among rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig>  and ccmfn, as well as a missing rpl <dig> in ks <dig> mtdna. whether these variations are related to wheat k-type cms requires further study.

research on the expression of novel orfs in ks <dig> mtdna is also necessary  <cit> , as the relevance of unknown orfs to cms has been reported, such as urf13-t in maize  <cit> , orf <dig> and orf <dig> in rapeseed  <cit> , orf <dig> in sunflower  <cit> , orf <dig> in radish  <cit> , orf <dig> in sorghum  <cit> , and orf <dig> in rice  <cit> . the proteins encoded by these orfs involved in cms may have structures similar to atp synthese subunits, which would lead to functional competition; pcf in petunia  <cit>  and orf <dig> in pepper  <cit>  were shown to be involved in recombination with the genes encoding cytochrome oxidase . another functional scenario is that these novel orfs may be involved in cms by damaging mitochondrial membrane structure. in maize, urf <dig>  encoded by t-urf <dig>  assembles into a tetramer that penetrates the mitochondrial membrane, and the resulting permeability change affects normal mitochondrial function  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that the process of anther abortion in k-type cms occurs in the two-cell stage or the late period of the three-cell state of anther development, and the development of pollen is regulated by multiple genes  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to profile the expression of the cms-specific orfs in distinct developmental stages, including the microspore mother cell, tetrad, single cell pollen grains, two-cell pollen grains, and three-cell pollen grains. we are preparing to explore molecular mechanisms of wheat k-type cms through a combination of genomic and proteomic tools, such as the analysis of the transcription and function of the unique orfs found in ks <dig> mtdna.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete mitochondrial genome of the wheat k-type cms line ks <dig> is very different from that of its maintainer line, km <dig>  especially in non-coding sequences. the ks <dig> mtdna is  <dig>  bp and harbors  <dig> known protein-coding genes, three rrnas ,  <dig> different trnas, ks3-specific mtdna , and repeats . in addition, rpl <dig> is missing, and  <dig> snps are involved in  <dig> protein-coding, albeit functionally irrelevant, genes, and  <dig> orfs are unique in ks <dig>  all these sequence variations are candidates for cms. comparative analysis of the mtdna of several angiosperms including ks <dig>  km <dig>  rice, maize, arabidopsis thaliana, and rapeseed, indicates that non-coding sequences are the most frequently reorganized part of the mitochondrial genome during mtdna evolution in higher plants.
