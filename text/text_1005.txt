BACKGROUND
the increase in drug-resistance coupled with the lack of new and effective antimicrobials indicates that modified drug-dosage regimens may be useful clinical alternatives. in the clinic, pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic  outcomes are interrelated  <cit> . pk/pd modeling in veterinary medicine can be used to define the relationship between the effects of different drug concentrations and therapeutic outcomes. in short, pk/pd modeling provides a chance for dosage optimization  <cit> . we used the tissue cage  infection model to evaluate pk and pd profiles in interstitial fluids in the presence of an active immune response .


p. multocida is a widespread pathogen that inhabits mucosal surfaces and upper respiratory tracts of clinically healthy animals  <cit> . it is the causative agent of fowl cholera in poultry, atrophic rhinitis in swine and hemorrhagic septicemia in buffalo and cattle . it also plays a major role in pneumonia in swine and ruminants as an opportunistic pathogen  <cit> .

marbofloxacin is a synthetic third-generation fluoroquinolone that is used solely in veterinary medicine  <cit> . it is active against gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria as well as mycoplasmas and other intracellular pathogens  <cit> . it is widely used against most of the swine respiratory pathogens including actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus parasuis and p. multocida .

marbofloxacin acts as a bactericidal concentration-dependent antibiotic similar to other fluoroquinolones. the auc24/mic or cmax/mic  are the pk/pd surrogates that most closely reflect clinical outcomes.  <cit> . we used an integrated pk/pd model to evaluate the in vivo antimicrobial activity of marbofloxacin against p. multocida in swine. this approach gives an approximation of the most effective treatment for achieving a bacteriological cure and minimizing the emergence of bacterial resistance.

methods
animals and tissue-cages
twenty clinically healthy castrated crossbred piglets ,purchased from guangdong pig breeding farm, with body weights of  <dig> to 18 kg were included in the study. these animals were housed in individual pens for a week prior to experiments with a controlled temperature of 26 °c. the animals were fed antimicrobial-free feed twice a day with water available ad libitum. tissue-cages were fabricated according to a previously published method  <cit> . two tissue-cages were implanted subcutaneously in the neck of each piglet after sedation and local anesthesia. about 3–4 weeks later and after wound healing,  <dig>  ml tissue-cage fluid  was sampled by percutaneous puncture. tcf samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic contaminants to ensure sterility before commencing the experiments.

bacterial strain and inoculant preparation

p. multocida strain cvcc <dig>  was purchased from the china veterinary culture collection centre . the original bacterial culture was isolated from a piglet that died of plague in jiang su, china. p. multocida was grown on tryptic soy agar  supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood . bacteria were cultured in mueller–hinton broth , with shaking at 37 °c and grown to 109 cfu/ml. the cells were then concentrated by centrifugation at 3000×g for 10 min and suspended in sterile  <dig> % nacl to 108 cfu/ml.

drugs
marbofloxacin was obtained as a 10% injectable aqueous solution from yuan zhen . marbofloxacin standard was purchased from dr. ehrenstorfer  and ofloxacin was acquired from the national institute for food and drug control . pentobarbital sodium was from jian yang biotechnology and procainamide hydrochloride was purchased from xin zheng .

mic determinations
mic values were determined by an agar dilution method as a preliminary screening according to clinical and laboratory standards institute  reference methods. in this study, we measured the mic of marbofloxacin against the p. multocida in the tissue-cage fluid by a micro dilution assay in triplicate using the tissue-cage fluid as matrix.

pk studies
tissue cage fluid  was sampled 1 h after the injection of drug and thereafter at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h. all the samples were centrifuged at 6000×g at 4 °c for 10 min. the supernatants were stored at −20 °c. the concentrations of marbofloxacin in tissue cage fluid were determined using a waters  <dig> series high performance liquid chromatography  system with fluorescence detection  <cit> . the chromatographic separation was achieved on an agilent bds c <dig> column  at 28 °c with a thermostat column oven . all tcf samples were thawed at room temperature before analysis and 3 ml of trichloromethane was added to a 10 ml centrifuge tube with 200 μl tissue-cage fluids spiked with 10 μl ofloxacin internal standard, and vortexed for 1 min. the aqueous layer was discarded after centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min and the organic layer was dried under a stream of nitrogen. the residue was suspended with  <dig>  ml mobile phase and a 10 μl aliquot was taken and injected into hplc for analysis after filtered through a  <dig>  μm nylon syringe filter . the determination of marbofloxacin in the tissue cage fluid was linear within a range of  <dig> –2 μg/ml and the correlation coefficient was > <dig> . the lower limit of quantitation was  <dig>  μg/ml. the recoveries of marbofloxacin in tissue-cage fluid were >85%. the standard deviations  and the coefficients of variability  for both interday and intraday were <8% in tcf.

tissue-cage infection and in vivo kill curve of marbofloxacin
twenty piglets were divided into ten groups randomly, with  <dig> tissue-cages for each group. 24 h after  <dig>  ml of p. multocida saline suspension  were injected into the sterile tissue cage; nine groups were treated with a series of marbofloxacin intramuscular injections  at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  mg/kg. the control group was given sterile physiological saline only. tcf samples were aspirated from the tissue-cages by percutaneous puncture at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after dosing. 100 μl of tissue cage fluid was serially diluted 10-fold in saline within 1 h of sampling for cfu determinations. from each dilution, 20 μl was spread on btsa plated in triplicate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °c.the limit of detection was 500 cfu/ml.

protein binding
to determination the protein binding of marbofloxacin in tcf, marbofloxacin at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and 2 mg/l was spiked into pooled uninfected tcf in triplicate. an amicon centrifree micropartition device with a  <dig> kda cutoff  was used to remove the protein-bound drug as previously described  <cit> . the marbofloxacin concentration before and after ultrafiltration and centrifugation was determined as described in the pk studies. the percent of drug bound to protein was calculated as the following equation: bound % =  × 100%, where cu is the filtrate concentration and ci is the initial concentration.

pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis
the mic value was included in the calculation of the pk/pd index. according to standard methodology, an inhibitory sigmoid emax model was used to assess the pk/pd index with the highest predictive value to the different indices for each dosing regimen . the r <dig> value was computed for the correlation between antimicrobial effectiveness and each of the pk/pd parameters.  <dig> e=emax−emax−e0×cen/ec50n+cen

RESULTS
mic of marbofloxacin for p. multocida
tissue cage fluid was sterile as assessed by aerobic and anaerobic culture. we then determined that the mic of marbofloxacin for p. multocida in tissue cage fluid was  <dig>  μg/ml ex vivo. this did not change after exposure to marbofloxacin for 24 h and this number was used for pk/pd calculations.

discussion
respiratory diseases greatly affect the production and health of swine and result in high economic losses  <cit> . in europe, p. multocida is one of the most common bacterial species among porcine respiratory diseases and leads to atrophic rhinitis in young pigs  <cit> . marbofloxacin shows excellent effectiveness for treating p. multocida infection through in vitro tests  <cit> . the protein binding of marbofloxacin was low in previous studies and was 52% for serum, 40% for tissue cage fluid in cattle and  <dig> % for pig serum  <cit> . only free drug in the interstitial fluid is microbiologically active against extracellular bacteria  <cit> .

in the present study, the protein binding of marbofloxacin in pig serum and tcf were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively and these values were independent of concentration in the range of  <dig>  ~ 2 μg/ml. the auc24tcf of marbofloxacin following single intramuscular administration  was estimated to be  <dig>  h·μg/ml, which was lower than that in plasma   <cit> . the cmax for tissue cage fluid was lower than previously reported in plasma  and tissue cage fluid  in pigs  <cit> .

the pk/pd model integrating the pk parameter, the in vitro mic and pd outcome are all valuable in designing rational dosage regimens and in the measurement of susceptibility breakpoints  <cit> . our data indicated that auc24tcf/mic was the best parameter that correlated with the in vivo antibacterial effects of marbofloxacin against p. multocida. this agrees with previous studies of marbofloxacin activity against p. multocida  <cit> . we found an auc24tcf/mic value of  <dig>  h  that was lower than the reported value in plasma in piglets   <cit> .

the auc24htcf/mic ratios that produced a 1-log reduction, and 50% and 90% of the maximum effect were  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively. the auc24tcf/mic ratio for bactericidal effects in this study was different from previous study values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h for 3-log reductions  <cit> . these differences may by accounted for by examining the ex vivo pk/pd model. this model holds the antibiotic concentration constant but this concentration would vary with time in the animal infection model  <cit> . in addition, the ex vivo and neutropenic murine lung infection models do not take the host immune responses into consideration. finally, the magnitude of pk/pd indices were influenced by the bacterial load and this may influence characteristics of the pk parameters. a higher antimicrobial concentration would be required for higher pathogen loads  <cit> .

an auc24/mic ratio exceeding a value of 125 h was reported as useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms while reducing the risk of resistance induction . in combination with the mic <dig>  from two previous studies, and the pk characteristics in this study, we can infer that a dosage regimen of marbofloxacin  <dig>  mg/kg  was effective for the treatment of p. multocida infections  <cit> . however, considering that we found an auc24tcf/mic ratio of  <dig>  h that produced a 3-log reduction in this investigation, a marbofloxacin dose of  <dig>  mg/kg every 24 h is recommended for treatment of p. multocida infections with mic values lower than  <dig>  μg/ml. the dosage  <dig>  mg/kg was calculated by the equation auc
24 =  <dig> ∗dose +  <dig>  . however, we did not assess the diffusion of marbofloxacin in lungs and the immune responses in lungs may be different from that in tissue cage fluid.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study characterized the in vivo effectiveness of marbofloxacin against p. multocida in a tissue cage model in pigs. the auc24tcf/mic proved to be the pk/pd index that predicted the antimicrobial activity of marbofloxacin against p. multocida. marbofloxacin presented excellent antibacterial activity with an auc24tcf/mic ratio of  <dig>  h for a 3-log reduction in bacteria. although this study needs to be validated by clinical treatment under practical conditions, the results indicated that it may be a critical step closer to clinical trials for optimization of dosage regimens.
