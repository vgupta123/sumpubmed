BACKGROUND
as a transportation fuel, ethanol has the potential to displace a substantial portion of gasoline. in recent years, ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has been attracting great attention. to produce ethanol, raw materials such as corn stover should be first pretreated and then hydrolyzed to liberate simple sugars, i.e. glucose and xylose. subsequently, these sugars are converted to ethanol by microbial fermentation  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae is believed to be the most promising biocatalyst for this conversion due to its wide use in the starch- and sucrose-based ethanol industry  <cit> . however, s. cerevisiae cannot ferment xylose into ethanol. since xylose is the second most abundant sugar present in the biomass hydrolysate after glucose, therefore fast xylose fermentation is required to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass economically  <cit> .

great progress has been achieved to make s. cerevisiae able to ferment xylose in the last decade  <cit> . s. cerevisiae can take up xylose by nonspecific transporters  <cit> . after entering into cells, xylose can be converted to xylulose by either the oxidoreductive pathway or the isomerization pathway  <cit> . since both pathways are absent in s. cerevisiae, therefore heterologous enzymes have to be introduced. compared to the oxidoreductive pathway, the isomerization pathway receives more attention since it does not have a cofactor imbalance issue  <cit> . after phosphorylation by endogenous xylulokinase, xylulose enters the pentose phosphate pathway and then glycolysis to produce ethanol  <cit> . in previous studies, several steps have been identified as bottlenecks that limit the xylose consumption rate, including slow xylose uptake  <cit> , slow conversion of xylose to xylulose  <cit> , and limited flux of the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . overexpression of xylose-utilizing proteins, to some extent, can remove these bottlenecks  <cit> . moreover, gre <dig> is thought to cause xylitol accumulation and its deletion is beneficial to minimize xylitol formation  <cit> . as well as genetic manipulations, adaptive evolution is necessary to increase the xylose consumption rate. for example, several studies showed that combinatorial use of genetic manipulations  and adaptive evolution in xylose media can generate efficient xylose-utilizing strains  <cit> . however, there are two drawbacks for these studies: 1) laboratory haploid strains were chosen as hosts, which are generally considered not as robust as industrial diploid strains when fermenting lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates  <cit>  and 2) plasmid-based protein expression was employed, which is regarded as not stable as integration-based protein expression  <cit> . although genome integration of xylose isomerase was pursued by tanino et al  <cit> , however, a laboratory haploid strain was selected to construct xylose-fermenting yeast. until recently, a xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae strain was reported based on an industrial diploid strain and genome integration of xylose isomerase and other genes  <cit> .

so far, fermenting xylose in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates remains a challenge. although industrial diploid strains are more robust compared to laboratory haploid strains, however, industrial diploid s. cerevisiae strains have been less pursued in previous studies. this study aims to construct fast xylose-fermenting yeast using an industrial ethanol-producing diploid s. cerevisiae strain as a host. for this purpose, s. cerevisiae cctcc m <dig> was chosen as the host. this strain is widely used to produce starch-based fuel and drinking ethanol and possesses phenotypes desired for industrial use, such as high tolerance to high temperatures, low ph value, and high ethanol and inhibitor concentrations  <cit> . to avoid unstable plasmid-based protein expression, we integrated all genes into chromosomes by homologous recombination. specifically, in addition to introduction of xyla and overexpression of xks <dig>  rpe <dig>  rki <dig>  tal <dig>  tkl <dig>  we also introduced a xylose transporter-encoding gene gxf <dig> from candida intermedia at the gre <dig> locus. after simple aerobic evolution in rich xylose media, the best evolved strain cibts <dig> consumed 80 g/l glucose and 40 g/l xylose in 24 hours at an initial od <dig> of  <dig>   and produced 53 g/l ethanol.

RESULTS
rational construction of xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae
figure  <dig> shows the whole process for strain construction. to convert xylose to xylulose in cells, two copies of a eukaryotic xylose isomerase-encoding gene piromyces xlya were integrated at the arg <dig> and ty <dig> loci sequentially. a strong promoter tpi1p was used to drive xlya expression. then, an additional copy of genes encoding xylulokinase  and four non-oxidative enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway  were inserted at the δ locus, resulting in cibts <dig>  these genes were all equipped with strong promoters to achieve high expression and to accelerate conversion of xylulose to ethanol. subsequently, a xylose transporter-encoding gene gxf <dig> was integrated at the gre <dig> locus to increase the xylose uptake rate and the resultant strain was cibts <dig>  this integration inactivated one of the two copies of gre <dig> 

adaptive evolution to obtain fast xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae
although cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> contained a xylose-fermenting pathway, however both strains grew and consumed xylose slowly even under aerobic conditions . to select for spontaneous mutants with improved growth and xylose consumption rates, both strains were subjected to serial transfer in yp medium supplemented with xylose under aerobic conditions. after ca.  <dig> transfers, the growth and xylose consumption rates of both strains started to increase. then additional several transfers were carried out for both strains until no improvement was observed. from the final transfers, both cultures were diluted and plated on ypx agar plates. multiple colonies of each strain were inoculated into yp medium supplemented with 40 g/l xylose to examine their xylose consumption rates. the two best strains cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> were obtained from cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> respectively. as previously reported  <cit> , these data show that adaptive evolution is required to obtain fast xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae as well as metabolic engineering.

next, the two evolved strains cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> were characterized with respect to their growth and xylose fermentation rates in yp medium supplemented with 40 g/l xylose, using their unevolved parents as controls . for both the unevolved strains cibts <dig> and cibts <dig>  cells grew very slowly with growth rates below  <dig>  h- <dig> and also consumed xylose very slowly . after adaptive evolution, in strikingly contrast, cibts <dig> showed a 6-fold increase of the growth rate and its xylose consumption rate was increased to  <dig>  g/g dcw/h . cibts <dig> even displayed a 10-fold increase of the growth rate and its xylose consumption rate reached  <dig>  g/g dcw/h . for both strains cibts <dig> and cibts <dig>  ethanol yields exceeded  <dig>  g/g xylose, while glycerol yields were kept low  and no xylitol accumulation was detected. taken together, these data clearly show that adaptive evolution significantly improves xylose fermentation and ethanol production.

gxf <dig> expression might contribute to increase growth and xylose consumption rates
a previous study showed that xylose uptake is a bottleneck for xylose fermentation and therefore, expression of gxf <dig> encoding a xylose transporter can accelerate xylose utilization  <cit> . in this study gxf <dig> also was introduced into cibts <dig> to further increase the xylose consumption rate, resulting in cibts <dig>  like cibts <dig>  cibts <dig> also grew very slowly with a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> in yp medium supplemented with 40 g/l xylose. after adaptive evolution, compared to cibts <dig> , cibts <dig>  showed a 95% increase of the growth rate and a 90% increase of the xylose consumption rate . accordingly, the ethanol production rate of cibts <dig> was increased to  <dig>  g/g dcw/h, which is 76% higher than that of cibts <dig> . besides, prolonged adaptive evolution of cibts <dig> did not generate a strain displaying better growth and fermentation performance. these results imply that gxf <dig> expression might contribute to increase growth and xylose consumption rates. moreover, since cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> were evolved independently, we cannot exclude the possibility that different mutations might have occurred in the two evolved strains.

mixed sugars can be cofermented efficiently into ethanol
to test whether mixed sugars can be cofermented efficiently, the best evolved strain cibts <dig> was characterized in yp medium supplemented with 80 g/l glucose and 40 g/l xylose. as shown in figure  <dig>  both sugars were consumed in 24 h with an ethanol yield of  <dig>  g/g sugar. the total sugar consumption rate was  <dig>  g/g dcw/h, which is 36% higher than that of cibts <dig> cultivated in yp medium supplemented with 40 g/l xylose. however, although both sugars were utilized in 24 h, xylose was not significantly consumed until glucose was depleted. as for byproducts, glycerol yields were also kept low  and no xylitol accumulation was detected. taken together, although glucose and xylose were consumed sequentially, these data clearly show that mixed sugars can be cofermented efficiently into ethanol.

cibts <dig> exhibits a higher activity of xylose isomerase
a recent study showed that an increased activity of xylose isomerase was observed during adaptive evolution, which in part contributed to efficient xylose assimilation  <cit> . in this study, we also examined whether the activity of xylose isomerase had increased during the adaptive evolution of cibts <dig>  to do this, xylose isomerase activities of strains cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> were compared. as shown in figure  <dig>  after adaptive evolution, a 100% increase of the xylose isomerase activity was observed for cibts <dig>  this result suggests that the elevated activity of xylose isomerase might have contributed to the efficient xylose fermentation of cibts <dig> 

discussion
fast xylose fermentation is a key technology to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass economically. although great progress has been achieved in the last decade, however xylose fermentation remains a challenge today. based on an industrial ethanol-producing diploid strain s. cerevisiae cctcc m <dig>  we constructed fast xylose-fermenting s. cerevisiae by genome integration of xylose-utilizing genes in this study.

strong promoter-driven expression of xyla, xks <dig>  and four genes of the non-oxidative ppp did not immediately result in obvious growth on xylose. for example, aerobic growth rates of cibts <dig> and cibts <dig> were  <dig>  h- <dig> and  <dig>  h- <dig>  respectively. although these two strains grew at rates comparable to similarly constructed strains h131-a <dig>   <cit>  and bspc <dig>   <cit> , their growth rates were substantially lower than that of rwb <dig>   <cit> . this might be caused by 1) only two copies of xyla integrated into the genome and 2) a different host strain used. by adapting cibts <dig> on xylose, we obtained cibts <dig> that showed a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> in rich xylose media. in parallel, we also engineered another industrial ethanol-producing diploid s. cerevisiae strain cicc  <dig> using the same strategy as cctcc m <dig> . the resultant strain cibts <dig> displayed a comparable growth rate  to that of cibts <dig>  suggesting that the engineering strategy is applicable to not only laboratory strains  <cit> , but industrial strains.

previous studies showed that gxf <dig> expression is beneficial to xylose fermentation in s. cerevisiae <cit>  and these studies were all carried out using recombinant yeast strains with a limited flux of xylose metabolism. in this study, we show that gxf <dig> expression might contribute to increase growth and xylose consumption rates. this notion could be further supported by additional evidence. in parallel to gxf <dig>  we also introduced into cibts <dig> another xylose transporter-encoding gene sut <dig> from pichia stipitis . after adaptive evolution, the resultant strain  exhibited a xylose consumption rate of  <dig>  g/g dcw/h in rich xylose media, which is 58% higher than that of cibts <dig> . however, without introducing heterologous xylose transporters, no further improvement was observed for cibts <dig> through prolonged adaptation on xylose. besides, these results also suggest that xylose uptake is a bottleneck for cibts <dig> that displays a relatively high flux of xylose consumption.

it has been reported that anaerobic xylose-limited continuous cultivation in a chemostat was required to reach maximal growth rates, as well as aerobic sequential batch cultivation  <cit> . however, in this study only simple aerobic batch cultivation was employed to generate fast-growing cibts <dig> with a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> in rich xylose media. the reason for dispensability of chemostat cultivation is probably attributed to gxf <dig> expression, since the purpose of xylose-limited chemostat cultivation is to improve xylose uptake  <cit>  which is the same as the purpose of gxf <dig> expression.

table  <dig> compares several best-performing xylose-fermenting strains. from this overall comparison, we know that cibts <dig> displays comparable or even superior phenotypes. however, it should be noted that the fermentation for these strains was carried out under different conditions. moreover, cibts <dig> was also examined in the undetoxified corn stover hydrolysate provided by national renewable energy laboratory and novozymes a/s. although under harsh conditions , cibts <dig> still converted  <dig>  g/l glucose and  <dig>  g/l xylose to  <dig>  g/l ethanol . this result suggests that cibts <dig> is a potential biocatalyst for ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. however, compared to the xylose fermentation in the rich media, the xylose utilization in the corn stover hydrolysate was much slower, which was probably caused by the presence of high concentrations of inhibitors. rational design and adaptation against inhibitors may be pursued to increase xylose fermentation in the undetoxified corn stover hydrolysate  <cit> .

evolutionary engineering is a powerful tool to generate strains with desired production traits  <cit> . several studies employed this tool to generate improved xylose-fermenting yeast  <cit> . however, this technique provides no information on genetic changes. for cibts <dig>  the increased activity of xylose isomerase is likely to contribute to its fast growth and efficient xylose fermentation. previous studies also observed an increase of the xylose isomerase activity after adaptive evolution  <cit> . except for the elevated xylose isomerase activity, other mutations might also have occurred in cibts <dig> to account for improved phenotypes, including increased xylose transport  <cit> , balanced xylose metabolic flux  <cit> , and even genome-scale changes  <cit> . however, accurate genetic changes occurred in cibts <dig> remain to be elucidated by genome resequencing and transcriptome analysis and this work will be pursued in our following research.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the construction of fast xylose-fermenting yeast cibts <dig> based on xylose isomerase and industrial diploid s. cerevisiae. this strain can convert 80 g/l glucose and 40 g/l xylose to 53 g/l ethanol in 24 hours at initial od <dig> of  <dig>   and therefore shows great potential for fuel ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.
