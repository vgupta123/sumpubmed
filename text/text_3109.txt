BACKGROUND
the g.66493737 t ≻ c marker located in the first intron of the mstn gene predicts the racing ability of thoroughbreds based on the quantitative traits best racing distance  or win-race distance . c/c homozygotes appear better suited for fast, short-distance races , whereas c/t genotypes seem to compete better in middle-distance races , while t/t homozygotes perform generally better over longer distances   <cit> . for two cohorts of elite horses a strong association was demonstrated for the c and t alleles with the sprinting or staying performance, respectively  <cit> .

a distant snp, biec2- <dig> , located 692 kb or 30 kb upstream of mstn or glutaminase  genes, respectively, is similarly associated with racing aptness  <cit> .fig.  <dig> location of the target polymorphisms on chromosome  <dig>  only the genes  most closely surrounding the three markers are depicted



the highest standard and most valuable elite flat races are known as group  races, whereas listed races are the next in status. the elite thoroughbreds described before had won at least one group race or a listed race. most previous studies have been performed with elite cohorts from countries with the most internationally regarded thoroughbred industry. such cohorts likely do not represent the population of thoroughbreds raced in countries in which horse racing is regarded to be of poorer quality on an international level. it would be very interesting to see if the association between mstn markers and best racing distance or other performance indicators holds true in a less well regarded thoroughbred population. therefore, we present an observational study on the previously identified variants in the equine mstn, thought to influence the racing ability of thoroughbred horses. for this we studied a cohort of  <dig> non-elite thoroughbreds raced in austria and turkey. races run were usually handicap races or other non-group or non-listed races.

it is currently not understood how the g.66493737 t ≻ c polymorphism, located in the middle of a relatively large intron , may influence the expression of genes involved in the development of juvenile and mature equine muscles. moreover, although some marginal increase in muscle mass has been described  <cit> , the massive increase in muscle mass seen in other species with mstn missense or nonsense mutations such as in knock-out mice  <cit> , double muscled cattle  <cit>  or “bully” whippets  <cit>  was not observed. the sine of the mstn promoter, ins227bp, is in high linkage disequilibrium  with the c allele at g.66493737 t ≻ c  <cit> , but considered less appropriate to predict racing aptness  <cit> . recently, haplotype data suggested that ins227bp is contemporary to and arose upon a haplotype containing the c allele at g.66493737 t ≻ c  <cit> . moreover, it is suggested that ins227bp, rather than the intron  <dig> snp of mstn, drives muscle fiber type characteristics and is the variant targeted by selection for short-distance racing  <cit> .

to find a possible mechanism for this, we analysed the sequence in silico to identify putative binding sites for dna methylation and transcription factors resulting from insertion of the ins227bp polymorphism.

RESULTS
linkage disequilibrium and allelic distribution
compared to the study by hill et al.  <cit>  our experimental cohort of average thoroughbreds was different in linkage disequilibrium pairwise tested for g.66493737 t ≻ c and ins227bp as well as for g.66493737 t ≻ c and biec2- <dig> . the lower disequilibrium observed between g.66493737 t ≻ c and biec2- <dig> makes it less difficult to assess the functional impact of either locus independent of the other. table  <dig> displays the distribution of the ins227bp, g.66493737 t ≻ c and the biec2- <dig> alleles in the cohort of  <dig> non-elite thoroughbreds.table  <dig> distribution of marker alleles across the cohort of non-elite horses 



the estimated frequencies for the presence of ins227bp  indel and the c alleles at g.66493737 t ≻ c and biec2- <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. heterozygotes represented the most abundant genotype for all mutations .

performance indicators
there was no statistically significant difference in victories, places and shows, starts, life earnings, best earnings in a race and average earning per start between the genotypes for each marker . however, the brd was significantly different between some of the genotypes . the rss was calculated for distances of ≤ 1300 m  and > 1300 m . on the short distance, the rss determined for the c/c and c/t genotypes at g.66493737 t ≻ c was significantly higher compared to t/t carriers . i/i genotypes had a marginally significant better rss than the n/n genotypes . for the biec2- <dig> genotypes no difference in rss was found for the short distance neither for distances more than 1300 m.table  <dig> mean ± sd of the performance indicators per marker genotype

sampling bias in this study could not be prevented since assessment of the racing ability was based on results of races run on different tracks under different circumstances and over a wide range of distances. this forced us to cluster race distance slightly differently as was done by others  <cit> . considering maximum speed of a thoroughbred, a real sprint distance should not be more than 1000 m  <cit> . we chose 1300 m as the nearest suitable approximation of a sprint distance to obtain a sufficient number of performances data. the same reason requested others to make a slightly different split at 1600 m  <cit> . existing data provide evidence that the proportion of anaerobic power decreases to less than 5 % if races are 2400 m or longer  <cit> . thus, the empirical classification of distances ranging between  <dig> and 2400 m according to the international federation of horseracing authorities  should be regarded as arbitrary. in this respect, the brd for the c/c  genotypes on average fell within the physiological “sprint” distance . ranges of brd between the c/t  and t/t  genotypes did overlap considerably, as was also reported by others  <cit> . this is plausible since in addition to genotype many more factors determine the racing success of a horse. nevertheless, the pattern confirms the underlying genetic aptness for a specific distance and could be used by the trainer to strategically design a horse’s racing career.

horses were identified as non-elite due to their non-competing status in group or listed races. however, there was a large variation in price money won and some might have become elite horses in the hands of other trainers. we tried to estimate the strength of the associations of the genotypes and racing aptness in the general horse population, however the sample size of  <dig> horses was too small to allow further analyses of association between genotype and racing performance. sample sizes of at least  <dig> horses and even more than  <dig> in case of victories would have been needed to obtain a minimal power of  <dig> . therefore, it is not surprizing that in other studies with larger cohorts brd was often the only trait that was significantly associated with genotype . although our brd was not based on winning races, instead being determined by distance of race in which the horse earned most money, the association with the genotypes of g.66493737 t ≻ c in our non-elite race horse population agrees with that described for cohorts of elite and better quality horses . the proportion of c/c homozygotes in our non-elite cohort was dissimilar to those given by hill et al.  <cit>  , but similar to that of tozaki et al.  <cit> . the proportion of t/t homozygotes in our cohort was similar to that of hill et al.  <cit>  but smaller than that of tozaki et al.  <cit>  , likely explained by the different origins of the populations.

the nearctic-northern dancer sire line is strongly associated with dispersion of the c/c genotype at g.66493737 t ≻ c  <cit> . our cohort did not confirm this finding. the mean percentage of nearctic blood in our g.66493737 t ≻ c c/c horses was not higher  than in the c/t and t/t horses. similar trends were found for the other two markers .

the c allele is not unique for thoroughbreds and thoroughbred-derived populations. it was even found at a high frequency in shetland ponies  and fulani horses   <cit> . in contrast, the ins227bp marker appears to be more specific for thoroughbreds, quarter horses and related breeds and is distributed across other breeds only at minor frequency  <cit> .

the reason of the statistical association of the mstn polymorphism with racing aptness is still unknown because the strongest marker for this trait, biec2- <dig>  <cit> , is located far upstream  of mstn near the locus of the glutaminase  gene. this mitochondrial enzyme is assumed to play a role in energy production. so far, this gene or its alleles have not been studied in the horse .

nevertheless, the c allele of g.66493737 t ≻ c is regarded as a marker for muscularity . inconsistently, the tightly associated ins227bp insertion polymorphism  <cit> , however, was not found to affect muscle mass  <cit> . thus, a possible effect of the c allele on muscle mass needs further confirmation. although the mstn polymorphisms may not clearly affect mature muscle mass, they might influence prenatal muscle differentiation and juvenile composition. in quarter horses and thoroughbreds the c allele at g.66493737 t ≻ c as well as the ins227bp marker appear to be associated with higher and lower proportions of type 2x and type i fibres, respectively  <cit> . thus, ins227bp could indicate the potential for high speed of thoroughbreds too. interestingly, thoroughbreds being homozygous for the c allele at g.66493737 t ≻ c showed rather a higher transcript expression of mstn in a non-trained condition compare to the c/t and t/t type. only after a period of 10 months of training the expression level decreased to similar levels as the c/t and t/t genotypes  <cit> . this contradicts the simplistic hypothesis that a decreased mstn expression leads to increased muscle mass. theoretically, the three target polymorphisms could cause a change of mstn expression by intron mediated enhancement , a distant regulatory dna element located several hundred kilobases away  <cit> , or by a genetic or epigenetic change of the mstn promoter.

novel transcription factor binding site candidates and cpg island caused by ins227bp
it was not very surprising that the insertion of the 227 bp sine  into the promoter of the mstn gene generated some novel putative binding sites for transcription factors . in more detail, whereas the insertion did not erase a putative transcription factor binding site according to the analysis tools jaspar, matinspector and uniprobe applied under stringent settings, it created one, three or four novel putative transcription factor binding sites according to the pairwise intersections of the three prediction programs . there was no site predicted by all three tools. more surprising, however, was the finding that the ins227bp insertion created a novel cpg island  including a downstream segment at the insertion site.fig.  <dig> insertion of the sine marker ins227bp into the equine mstn promoter created one, three or four putative transcription factor binding sites according to the pairwise intersections of predictions obtained by the software tools jaspar, matinspector and uniprobe. the pairwise intersections contained nkx3- <dig> and the closely related nkx3- <dig> , nkx2- <dig>  znf <dig> and mzf <dig> , as well as plagi <dig> , znf <dig> or nearly identical znfs and nkx2- <dig> . the venn diagram was generated with eulerape  <dig> . <dig> 

fig.  <dig> inserting the ins227bp sine into the mstn promoter generates a novel cpg island. the 184 bp island  was identified by the methprimer software. red bars designate cpg dinucleotides. the integration-flanking set of 15 bp direct repeats, taaaaagccacttgg, one being part of and the other being adjacent to the sine insertion, is depicted by arrows



gene expression differences that are the result of sine insertions are likely to be a recurrent theme in the study of complex traits  <cit> , however, so far very few studies have conclusively demonstrated exaptation of transposable elements as transcriptional regulatory regions  <cit> . their functioning as nucleation centres for de novo methylation is striking in an epigenetic context  <cit> . further dissecting the effects of the genetic variants will benefit understanding the regulation of the racing ability of thoroughbreds. of special interest in this regard would be, to unravel whether the sine ins227bp of the mstn promoter would regulate mstn expression via the generated cpg island and/or via changed target sites for transcriptional regulator.

CONCLUSIONS
each of the the three polymorphisms studied represents a suitable genetic marker to predict the sprinting ability of non-elite thoroughbreds. future experiments with large numbers of horses, between  <dig> to over  <dig>  depending on the studied trait should address the possible role of the sine insertion ins227bp as a putative cis element enabling transcriptional regulation via association with trans-acting factors and/or modulation by exercise. the use of untrained age-matched controls will exclude that methylation regulates expression of mstn in an age-dependent manner in horses of  <dig> and 30 months  <cit> .
