BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  are members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily and were first discovered when ectopic cartilage and bone formation were induced by demineralized bone matrix implanted into soft tissues of animals  <cit> . however, their biological roles go far beyond osteogenesis  <cit> . bmps have been extensively studied during the development of the vertebrate limb, which has long been recognized as an excellent experimental system to study the genes and signaling pathways involved in patterning complex structures.

the first stage in which bmps were assessed in limb development is the establishment of the anterior-posterior limb axis. in amniotes, the posterior region of the forming limb bud is referred to as the zone of polarizing activity  and is an organizer of the anterior-posterior patterning of developing limbs  <cit> . when cells from the zpa are grafted into the anterior region of a chick limb bud, polydactyly is induced  <cit> . previous studies have shown that sonic hedgehog  is expressed exclusively in the zpa and that implanting shh expressing cells, or beads of shh, in the anterior limb bud is sufficient to reproduce the polydactyly induced with zpa transplants  <cit> . on the other hand, knockout mice for shh display a major deficiency in the anterior-posterior patterning of their autopods which resemble a spike like structure  <cit> . thus, shh appears to be a mediator for the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis of the limb  <cit> . because of the restricted expression of shh to the posterior margin, it remains unclear, however, whether shh induces the limb polarity directly or through a secondary signal. bmp- <dig> has received much attention as a downstream target of shh. indeed, bmp- <dig> expression overlaps spatiotemporally with the expression of shh in the early developing limb bud of mammalian and avian embryos  <cit>  and can be induced in chick anterior wing buds by ectopic shh expression  <cit> . however, overexpression of bmp- <dig> alone does not reproduce the polydactyly obtained with shh overexpression in chick embryos  <cit> . moreover, bmp- <dig> expression is maintained in the limb buds of shh knockout mice  <cit> . in addition, the polarity and digit identity is normal in mice with bmp- <dig> deficient limbs  <cit> . hence, these data show that bmp- <dig> is not essential to relay shh signaling in developing limbs.

in more advanced limb developmental stages, bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> and bmp- <dig> are all expressed in the interdigital  tissue  <cit> . extirpation experiments of id tissues have shown that anterior-posterior identity is not a fixed property of digital primordia and that the id tissues are important for digit patterning  <cit> . experiments with inhibitors of bmp signaling in id tissue suggested that differential levels of bmps in the id mesenchyme may be important in directing digit patterning  <cit> . however, a recent study  <cit>  with conditional knockout for bmp- <dig>  bmp- <dig> or bmp- <dig> showed that these bmps are not essential as signals from the id mesenchyme for specifying digit identity but that they mediate id programmed cell death as previously reported  <cit> . in the chicken, overexpression of dominant negative type i-a or type i-b bmp receptors , in embryonic hind limbs, reduced id tissue apoptosis and resulted in webbed feet  <cit> . on the contrary, application of bmp- <dig> or bmp- <dig> in the id tissues accelerated and intensified apoptosis  <cit> . in ducks  <cit>  and bats  <cit> , bmps are also expressed in the id tissues of developing digits. however, these animals have webbed autopods and apoptosis is absent in id tissues, suggesting expression of bmps could have other roles in digit formation.

one aspect that is clearly affected by the expression of bmp- <dig> in developing limbs is skeletal development  <cit> . it was shown, in chicks, that bmps are needed for chondroprogenitor cell determination and/or condensation and subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes  <cit> . in mice with bmp-2/bmp- <dig> deficient limbs, differentiation of condensed prechondrocytes into chondrocytes is delayed, indicating that a threshold level of bmps is required to trigger chondrogenesis  <cit> . in these mutants, the two posterior digits fail to form as a consequence of the misexpression of the sox- <dig> gene. sox- <dig>  a high mobility group -domain transcription factor, is the earliest marker of chondrogenesis  <cit> , and a regulator of the type ii collagen gene, which is a major constituent of cartilage  <cit> . sox- <dig> is a known target of bmp- <dig>  <cit>  and overexpression of bmp- <dig> in developing chick limbs induces sox- <dig> expression which then stimulates cartilage formation  <cit> .

among tetrapod vertebrates, urodele amphibians  have a unique developmental pattern of their limbs. indeed, while amniotes and anurans develop their digits almost simultaneously with a slightly accelerated onset of posterior digit formation   <cit> , urodeles show a reversed sequence with a more progressive/successive development of anterior digits followed by posterior digits  <cit> . although the order of digit development is different between the aforementioned animals, the end point is the same with similar digit identity in the mature limb  <cit> . moreover, even though there is no clearly defined zpa per se in axolotl and newt, shh is expressed, as in amniotes, in the posterior mesenchyme of their developing and regenerating limb buds  <cit> . the inhibition of shh signaling with cyclopamine leads to an anterior-posterior truncation of autopod elements in the developing and regenerating axolotl limbs  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of shh in the anterior mesenchyme of regenerating limbs induces polydactyly  <cit> , showing that as in amniotes, shh has a morphogenetic property in patterning the anterior-posterior axis in developing and regenerating urodele limbs.

the present study addresses the role of bmp- <dig> during limb regeneration in axolotl. we report the first cloning of an axolotl full length bmp cdna . we use cyclopamine, a pharmacological inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling pathway, to show that, as in mouse, bmp- <dig> is not likely to be the secondary signal of shh. bmp- <dig> is expressed in the id tissues of developing digits in virtually all tetrapod species  <cit>  and the expression of sox- <dig> in these digits is linked to bmp- <dig> expression  <cit> . the fact that the sequential development/regeneration of digits in axolotl limbs is the opposite of that observed in other tetrapods , even though shh expression is expressed on the posterior side of axolotl developing/regenerating limbs, allowed us to assess whether the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> correlated with digits appearance  or whether their expression correlated with shh signaling in conditions where it was normal or inhibited. the effect of bmp- <dig> or noggin  overexpression on regenerating digits was also assessed.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of bmp-2
the axolotl full-length cdna encoding bmp- <dig> was cloned, sequenced and compared to the sequence of other vertebrates. several bmp- <dig> clones were isolated from an axolotl cdna library. the longest clone of  <dig> bp  comprising an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp was selected. the analysis of this orf, using ncbi-blast, showed a highly conserved sequence homology of the bmp- <dig> orf with that of other species: 83% identity to human; 83% to mouse; and  <dig> % to xenopus laevis. moreover, the 3' utr of the bmp- <dig> gene was highly conserved with that of other species .

the translated orf of axolotl bmp- <dig> has a predicted amino acid sequence of  <dig> amino acids  that varies by less than 1% in length when compared to that of human, mouse and xenopus laevis. the amino acid sequence derived from the orf also showed a highly conserved protein homology between species: 73% with human, 72% with mouse, and 68% with xenopus laevis and resulted in an expected value  of less than 1e- <dig> when blasted in gen bank. seven highly conserved cysteine residues characteristic to all members of the tgf-β super family  <cit>  are also present .

bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> expression during limb development
whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed on developing forelimbs of axolotl from developmental stages  <dig> to  <dig>  the nomenclature of nye et al.  <cit>  was used to determine the staging and to label the digits of the forelimb. digit  <dig> is the anterior most  and digit  <dig> the posterior most.

at stage  <dig>  the expression of bmp- <dig> was mainly detected as a narrow band that surrounded the anterior border of the limb bud and extended slightly to the posterior part of the distal end. prior to stage  <dig>  the expression of bmp- <dig> was expressed as a band at the edge of the limb covering both the anterior to posterior portions of the limb  as described previously for xenopus laevis  <cit> . sox- <dig> was also expressed in the anterior portion of the limb bud at stage  <dig> while shh expression is restricted to the posterior . at stage  <dig>  the expression of bmp- <dig> had become restricted to the interdigital space between the developing digits  <dig> and  <dig> and is adjacent to the expression of sox- <dig> in these two digits at stage  <dig> . at this stage, sox- <dig> expression correlates with the developing cartilage elements of the wrist  and the first two digits  . at stage  <dig>  bmp- <dig> was mainly expressed between developing digits  <dig> and  <dig> and was adjacent to the expression of sox- <dig> in these two digits at stage  <dig> . at this stage, the expression of sox- <dig> at the tip of digit  <dig> correlated with the formation of skeletal elements in digit  <dig>  and the expression in digit  <dig> primordium was not yet associated with skeletal elements as revealed by victoria blue staining . finally, at stage  <dig>  bmp- <dig> was expressed between developing digits  <dig> and  <dig> and was adjacent to the expression of sox- <dig> in these two digits at stage  <dig> . at that stage, the expression of sox- <dig> at the tip of digit  <dig> correlated with the formation of skeletal elements in digit  <dig> but the expression in digit  <dig> primordium was not yet associated with skeletal elements as revealed by victoria blue staining . in addition to its expression between digits  <dig> and  <dig> at stage  <dig>  bmp- <dig> expression was still detectable at the base of all  <dig> digits. this expression was not investigated further in the present study but has been associated with the elongation phase of digits in other species  <cit> .

effects of blocking shh signaling in developing digits
as described above, at stage  <dig>  bmp- <dig> and shh expression are on opposite sides of the developing limb bud . it has been clearly demonstrated in mouse that bmp- <dig> is not essential for digit identity  <cit> . it was shown  that shh is not essential for chondrogenesis and is dispensable for bmp- <dig> expression  <cit> . based on these observations, we tested, in axolotl, whether bmp- <dig> expression is independent of shh signaling. the hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine  <cit>  was used to determine whether bmp- <dig> expression is independent of shh signaling. the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> were assessed in limbs of animals treated with  <dig> different concentrations of cyclopamine that were shown in a previous study to prevent the formation of posterior digits  <cit> . in the aforementioned study, the digits that remained after cyclopamine treatment were identified as follows: when  <dig> digits remained after treatment, they were found to be digits  <dig> and  <dig>  and when only  <dig> digit remained , it was identified as digit  <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, cyclopamine treatment was initiated at developmental stage  <dig> which corresponds to the onset of shh expression  <cit> . we confirmed that the expression of shh at various limb development stages  was has it had been reported previously by two other groups  <cit> . the group of imokawa et al. also reported that shh is expressed as late as the 2- <dig> digit stage  <cit>  which corresponds to stage 51- <dig> based on nye et al.  <cit> . the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> was assessed after  <dig>  and  <dig>  days of treatment to see whether their expression correlated with skeletogenesis even in the absence of shh signaling. bmp- <dig> expression was not affected by the presence of cyclopamine prior to stage  <dig> of limb development . the expression of sox- <dig> was not affected either at stage  <dig> in cyclopamine treated animals .

 <dig> days
after  <dig> days of treatment , control animals  had reached stage  <dig> with digits  <dig> and  <dig> in formation . bmp- <dig> was expressed in the interdigital space of digits 1- <dig> and 2- <dig>  and sox- <dig> was expressed at the tips of digits  <dig> and  <dig>  and fully expressed in the forming digit  <dig> and in the carpal elements of the wrist . as expected, bmp- <dig> expression was adjacent to sox- <dig> expression in digits  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in limbs treated with  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine , digits  <dig> and  <dig> were deformed and in animals treated with  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine , only  <dig> digit was formed. the expression pattern of bmp- <dig> was adjacent to the expression of sox- <dig> in the forming digits of cyclopamine treated animals just as it is in control animals.

 <dig> days
after  <dig> days of treatment , control animals had reached stage  <dig>  and at this stage the pattern is complete. limbs treated with  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine developed only digits  <dig> and  <dig> and limbs treated with  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine developed only digit  <dig>  in control animals, the expression of bmp- <dig> was observed around the digits, and the expression of sox- <dig> was in digits  <dig> and  <dig>  this developmental stage corresponds to the elongation phase of digits in other species  <cit>  and as previously mentioned, was not investigated further. in the animals treated with  <dig> μg/ml  or  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine  the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> in the digits that have formed  was adjacent, with the expression of bmp- <dig> surrounding the expression of sox- <dig> as in the digits of control animals.

bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> expression during limb regeneration
limb regeneration in salamander can be divided into two main phases. 1) a preparation phase that starts at amputation time and focuses mainly on the formation of the blastema; and 2) a redevelopment phase that starts approximately at the late bud stage and focuses mainly on the differentiation and repatterning of the blastema into a new limb . to determine when bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> are expressed, whole mount in situ hybridisation was performed for both genes throughout limb regeneration. the onset of bmp- <dig> expression occurred at the early bud stage  while sox- <dig> was not yet expressed . the expression of bmp- <dig> was maintained distally in the blastema of medium bud  and late bud  stages  and was adjacent to the more proximal expression of sox-9; which starts at mb stage . at the palette  stage, bmp- <dig>  and sox- <dig>  expression started to localize in the anterior region where the first two digits eventually form . at this stage, the expression of bmp- <dig>  versus that of shh was on the opposite side of the autopod . as in development at stage  <dig> , the opposing pattern of expression of shh and bmp- <dig> just preceded the onset of digit chondrogenesis. at pal stage, bmp- <dig>  delineates the first  <dig> digits, and at early differentiation  stage, bmp- <dig> expression also appears between digits  <dig> and  <dig> . at these two stages , the expression of sox- <dig> , was adjacent to bmp- <dig> expression  and corresponded to the exact location of the skeletal elements. in later stages  sox- <dig> expression was tightly correlated to digit chondrogenesis as revealed by victoria blue staining .

effects of blocking shh signaling on regenerating digits
as described above, at pal stage, bmp- <dig> expression is on the opposite side of the regenerating limb bud compared to that of shh . to determine if shh signaling had an effect on bmp- <dig> expression during limb regeneration, as determined for axolotl developing limbs , axolotls were treated with cyclopamine. the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig>  was not affected after  <dig> or  <dig> hours of exposure to  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine . the expression of bmp- <dig> at medium bud was not affected in regenerating limbs exposed to cyclopamine from the time of amputation either . therefore, in order to mimic as close as possible the shh knockout phenotype, axolotls were treated from the moment of limb amputation until ed . the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> was assessed at ed stage to determine whether their expression correlated with skeletogenesis during the redevelopment phase of regeneration as shown for development . in animals treated with  <dig> μg/ml of cyclopamine, bmp- <dig> expression  was adjacent to sox- <dig> expression . the same observation was made in the  <dig> μg/ml treated animals . under these conditions, the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> relative to each other was the same as observed in corresponding digits of control limbs . as in development, the  <dig> μg/ml treated animals regenerated limbs with only two digits  while the  <dig> μg/ml treated animals regenerated limbs with only one digit . hence, the effect of cyclopamine on patterning regenerated skeletal elements as well as the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> were virtually identical to that observed in developing limbs treated with cyclopamine.

overexpression of bmp- <dig> and noggin in regenerating limbs
prior to investigating the in vivo role of bmp- <dig> during limb regeneration, constructs expressing the monomeric red fluorescent protein , bmp- <dig> and noggin were tested in vitro to verify their efficacy . c28/i <dig> cells were cotransfected with mrfp, axolotl bmp- <dig> and xenopus laevis noggin along with the bmp-responsive bre2-luc luciferase reporter construct  <cit>  as well as a cmv-β-galactosidase construct as a control. luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined  <dig> hours later and results  are presented as relative light unit  normalised with β-galactosidase. the first bar shows a basal activity  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the second bar shows that axolotl bmp- <dig> activity is significantly  higher  than the basal activity . in the third bar, the activity of xenopus laevis noggin  alone  is significantly  lower than bmp- <dig> activity and also significantly  lower than basal activity. finally, the fourth bar shows the activity  resulting from bmp- <dig> in the presence of noggin. the activity of this combination  is significantly  lower than the bmp- <dig> activity alone . comparison between each condition  was tested using kruskal-wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks. hence, these results show the plasmids expressing axolotl bmp- <dig> and xenopus laevis noggin produced functional proteins. as expected, the bmp responsive luciferase reporter construct was activated in the bmp- <dig> transfected cells and was antagonized in the noggin transfected cells .

in vivo experiments were performed on regenerating limbs and were based on the expression pattern of bmp- <dig> &sox- <dig> determined by whole mount in situ hybridisation . bmp- <dig> and noggin containing plasmids were electroporated in the posterior-half of the blastema at the lb stages in order to obtain maximal expression of the transgene by the time the regenerates reached pal; the stage when expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> is localized in the anterior portion of the limb . hence, the electroporation was performed to induce bmp- <dig> or noggin at a time and place when no or low endogenous expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> is detected.

the electroporation of bmp- <dig> at the lb stage  resulted in the absence of digit formation  in the region of the electroporation , while controls  were normal  in most cases . in  <dig> control electroporated limb,  <dig> digit was missing as it sometimes happens in untreated animals . the electroporation of xenopus laevis noggin under the same conditions  resulted in a similar phenotype  to those obtained with the electroporation of bmp- <dig>  when the same quantity of plasmid was injected throughout the blastema to obtain an even distribution of expression across the blastema with bmp- <dig>  or noggin , regeneration was inhibited . expression of the mrfp construct alone throughout the blastema resulted in normally regenerating limbs  therefore ruling out the electroporation itself as a cause for the inhibition of regeneration . all electroporations performed prior to the lb stages with bmp- <dig> in the full blastema had very mild effects  and in the majority of cases, had no effect  . the electroporation with noggin prior to the lb stage had no effect in all cases  . in control animals the electroporation of mrfp prior to lb gave rise to normal limbs . with every construct combination used , the fluorescence detected from the mrfp construct lasted a short time  when the electroporation was done prior to lb stage, compared to electroporation at lb stage which lasted longer .

to investigate further the effects of bmp- <dig> miss-expression, histological analysis was performed using the masson's trichrome staining on limbs electroporated with bmp- <dig> or noggin . although the phenotypes of animals electroporated with bmp- <dig> or noggin appeared similar from an exterior perspective , the histology results showed significant differences at the tissue level. while limbs electroporated with bmp- <dig> showed an increase in cellular density  in the electroporated region , limbs electroporated with noggin  did not show any sign of such increase in cellular density or condensation . hence, these results suggest that the similarity between the phenotypes obtained with bmp- <dig> and noggin are caused by opposite effects of the ectopically expressed genes; an increase in cellular density or condensation with bmp- <dig> and a lack of cellular density or condensation with noggin leading to a loss of digits.

histological analysis provided some indication as to why bmp- <dig> and noggin overexpression caused a loss of digits in regenerating limbs but it did not provide any mechanisms. therefore, in order to help uncover the mechanism as to how digit loss resulted following bmp- <dig> and noggin overexpression, cell division and apoptosis were measured  <dig> days after electroporation of mrfp, bmp- <dig> and noggin. electroporation was performed at lb stage as described above and cell division was determined by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine  incorporation  and apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  assay . bmp- <dig> overexpression did not seem to cause major changes in cell division  compared to the controls electroporated with mrfp  which regenerated normally . although bmp- <dig> overexpression did not cause major changes in cell division, it did cause a marked increase in the number of apoptotic cells  when compared to control electroporated with mrfp . on the opposite, noggin overexpression resulted in a marked reduction in cell division  and the near absence of apoptotic cells  compared to bmp- <dig> overexpression and the control electroporated with mrfp.

discussion
our results show that the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> in developing axolotl digits is very similar to the expression observed in other non amphibian species   <cit> . the expression pattern of these two genes is also reproduced during digit formation in regenerating axolotl limbs. since sox- <dig> is the earliest marker of chondrogenesis and a known target of bmp- <dig>  these results suggest an activation of sox- <dig> expression  by bmp- <dig> expressing cells .

as described by previous studies  <cit> , the number of digits that form in cyclopamine treated animals  is dose-dependent. in the digits that do form in cyclopamine treated animals, the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> as well as chondrogenesis proceed normally. these results suggest that in axolotl just as it was observed in mice  <cit> , bmp- <dig> is not likely to be a secondary signal for shh signaling. this is also supported by the fact that when digits begin to condense in developing and regenerating limbs, bmp- <dig> and shh expression are on opposite sides of the limbs  and do not overlap. hence, these results suggest that, as in mouse, bmp- <dig> can trigger cell condensation independently of shh signaling.

our results strongly suggest that the inhibition of digit regeneration, in the limbs in which bmp- <dig> was overexpressed, is the result of increased cell condensation and apoptosis. this is also supported by a previous study showing an inhibition of chick limb development in the presence of ectopic bmp- <dig>  <cit> . the bmp- <dig> overexpression experiments and the complementarities of expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> , support our hypothesis that bmp- <dig> triggers the condensation of adjacent cells destined to become chondrocytes . taken together, theses results suggest that the role of bmp- <dig> during limb regeneration is to trigger cell condensation and may be to control, to some extent, apoptosis. the data obtained with noggin overexpression also provides further insight on the potential role of bmp signaling in the regeneration process. noggin is an inhibitor of bmps  and therefore the results obtained could potentially affect bmps other than bmp- <dig>  however, these results indicate that bmp signaling is essential for cellular division and apoptosis during the regeneration process, since both processes are inhibited when noggin is overexpressed.

the fact that the effects of bmp- <dig> and noggin were observed when overexpressed at the lb stage suggest that bmp- <dig> regulates cellular activities during the redevelopment phase of regeneration that starts approximately at the lb stage or later . however given that overexpression of bmp- <dig> and noggin were performed using electroporation of plasmids, technical limitations do not allow us to draw any conclusion regarding the role of bmp- <dig> during the preparation phase of regeneration. given the high level of cell proliferation and tissue reorganisation during the stages prior to the lb stage, it is possible that the electroporated plasmids could have been degraded before affecting the regeneration process or that cells compensated somehow to overcome the ectopic bmp signaling. this is supported by the rapid rate of fading of red fluorescence resulting from the reporter mrfp plasmid, when electroporations were done prior to lb stage. in addition, the fact that noggin did not affect regeneration when overexpressed prior to lb stage is indicative that bmp signaling may not be essential for cellular proliferation during eb and mb stages.

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents the first study on the role of bmps during the process of limb regeneration in urodele amphibians. our data demonstrate that the role of bmp- <dig> is conserved in limb regeneration as in limb development and that its function is related to skeletogenesis, cellular proliferation and apoptosis but not pattern formation, as previously demonstrated by the group of tabin in mice  <cit> . the ectopic expression of bmp- <dig> led to the condensation of cells in regenerating axolotl limbs. the expression of bmp- <dig> and sox- <dig> in addition to our functional analysis data from the ectopic expression of both bmp- <dig> and noggin clearly indicate that bmp signaling is essential for the process of limb regeneration especially during the redevelopment phase where re-differentiation of all the different cell types and pattern formation occur.
