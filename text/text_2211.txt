BACKGROUND
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  is a gram-negative organism that is both a common commensal of the upper respiratory tract as well as a significant cause of respiratory tract infections in humans. nthi is the second most common cause of acute otitis media after streptococcus pneumoniae and, in many studies, is the most common cause of recurrent otitis media based on cultures of middle ear fluids obtained by tympanocentesis  <cit> . recurrent otitis media is associated with pain, the need for insertion of tympanostomy tubes under general anesthesia, conductive hearing impairment, and delayed speech and language development  <cit> . currently, otitis media is commonly treated with antibiotics, among which amoxicillin is the consensus recommendation for the initial therapy  <cit> . but approximately 20–35% of nthi strains, depending on geographic location, produce β-lactamase and these strains are resistant to amoxicillin  <cit> . moreover, there is currently no licensed vaccine available to prevent nthi infections. thus, illuminating the molecular mechanisms of nthi infections could lead to the development of novel strategies to improve prophylaxis and treatment of otitis media.

adhesin molecules on the surface of nthi are shown to bind to respiratory tract target cells and activate these cells to induce inflammation  <cit> . nthi also penetrates into human respiratory tract cells  and the interstitium to cause nasopharyngeal colonization and respiratory infection  <cit> . biofilms of nthi found in middle ears are postulated to be responsible for the resistance to clearance by host immune responses and antibiotic treatments, therefore resulting in recurrent otitis media  <cit> . however, there is controversy whether the reported biofilm is an outcome of infectious interactions between the host and nthi or a programmed phenotype of nthi virulence  <cit> . although these observations have advanced our understanding, much of the pathogenesis of nthi-induced otitis media, especially recurrent otitis media, is largely unknown.

toxin-antitoxin  systems are small genetic modules comprised of two components, a stable toxin and its labile antitoxin. ta systems in prokaryotic genomes are classified into  <dig> types, based on the antitoxin nature and mode of action. while toxins are always proteins, antitoxins are either rnas  or proteins   <cit> . several common families of type ii modules have been identified on the chromosomes of bacteria and archaea: relbe, higba, mazef, ccdab, vapbc, parde, phd–doc, ζε, hipba, and yoeb–yefm <cit> . type ii ta systems are thought to be part of the mobilome and to move from one genome to another through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . they are hypothesized to function in stress management either by promoting altruistic sacrifice of a large fraction of the population  or by inducing a dormant stage  that allows cells to cope with stress  <cit> .

type ii ta systems are typically two-gene operons with the antitoxin encoded upstream of the toxin gene. the proteic antitoxins bind their cognate toxins and inhibit toxin activity. antitoxins or toxin-antitoxin complexes autorepress ta module transcription. under stressful environmental conditions such as nutrient limitation, antibiotic therapy, or oxidative stress, ta modules are activated. the labile antitoxin is degraded by either the lon or clp proteases and the more stable toxin is freed to facilitate growth arrest. many toxins are mrna-specific rnases that rapidly inhibit protein synthesis, inducing a bacteriostatic state. upon improved conditions , antitoxin synthesis resumes to counteract toxin activity, and tmrna activity rescues ribosomes arrested on toxin-cleaved messages  <cit> . virulence-associated protein  genes, first identified in pathogenic strains of the gram-negative, strict anaerobe dichelobacter nodosus, are found as transmissible genetic elements for the transfer of virulence determinants  <cit> . the vap genes are recognized as a part of pathogenicity islands , a group of laterally-transferred genes in the bacterial genome, which help the organism explore and adapt to new ecological niches  <cit> .

four vap operons, toxavapa, vapbc- <dig>  vapbc- <dig>  and vapxd have been identified in the genomes of numerous nthi strains, including rd kw <dig>  <cit> , r <dig>  <cit> , and 86-028np  <cit> . all vap operons display the characteristic features of type ii ta modules, and vapbc- <dig> and vapxd have been shown to act as ta loci in nthi  <cit> . during recurrent and chronic otitis media, nthi are exposed to hostile conditions such as antibiotic treatment, host immune responses, and nutrient deprivation. it is thought that a subpopulation of nthi can resume the infection after cessation of these stressors, resulting in a persistent infection. although ta modules function to allow bacterial adaptation to environmental stresses, the pathogenic roles of the nthi vapbc- <dig> and vapxd operons have not been elucidated in otitis media. it has been shown that the protein products of canonical type ii ta loci interact to form protein complexes that autoregulate their cognate promoters  <cit> . accordingly, we examined the heterodimerization characteristics of the vapb- <dig> antitoxin with the vapc- <dig> toxin, as well as interactions of the antitoxin vapx with the toxin vapd. we then constructed vapbc- <dig>  vapxd, and vapbc- <dig> vapxd double deletion mutants in strain 86-028np. the survival properties of these mutants were compared to the wild type parent strain during long-term infections of a primary human respiratory epithelial tissue at the air-liquid interface , the epiairway™ tissue. the nthi ta mutants were then analyzed for persistence in vivo using the chinchilla model of otitis media over the course of a 4-day infection. finally, we tested the vapd toxin for ribonuclease activity in vitro. the current work is aimed at uncovering the contributions of vapbc- <dig> and vapxd to nthi-caused otitis media, which could lead to new vaccine or pharmaceutical targets for the prophylaxis and therapy of this disease.

RESULTS
interactions of the vap proteins in vivo
to detect the ability of vapb- <dig> and vapc- <dig> to form heterodimers in vivo, β-galactosidase activity assays were carried out using an e. coli-based lexa protein-protein interaction reporter system as previously described  <cit> . in this system, with no protein fused to the lexa dna binding domain  of either plasmid psr <dig> or psr <dig> in strain su <dig>  the repressor cannot form a dimer, and the expression of the lacz reporter gene is constitutive. however, a reconstituted repressor formed by heterodimerization of fused proteins can bind to the engineered operator region, decreasing transcription of the reporter gene, but a homodimer, if formed, cannot bind to the operator. since the lexa dbd plasmids have different copy numbers , we constructed reciprocal fusions and analyzed each set as an internal control for heterodimerization. when we fused vapc- <dig> to the lexa dbd in psr <dig>  and vapb- <dig> to psr <dig> , the reporter gene expression was decreased to 458 ±  <dig> miller units, whereas the unfused lexa dbd in the vectors psr <dig> and psr <dig> allowed constitutive transcription of the reporter gene at  <dig>  ±  <dig> miller units . this indicated a strong protein:protein interaction. when the fusions were reversed, with vapb- <dig> in psr <dig>  and vapc- <dig> in psr <dig> , the pair heterodimerized and repressed lacz expression to 682 ±  <dig> miller units. interestingly, there was a significant difference between the reciprocal fusions, with the pdd859/pdd <dig> pair being the most efficient at repressing the reporter gene.

to investigate the hetero-interactions between vapx and vapd, the same reporter system was used as above. with vapx in psr <dig>  and vapd in psr <dig> , the reporter gene expression was decreased to  <dig> ±  <dig> miller units, compared to the expression in the presence of the control vectors of  <dig>  ±  <dig> miller units . likewise, the reciprocal fusion, with vapd in psr <dig>  and vapx in psr <dig> , resulted in  <dig> ±  <dig> miller units, both significantly lower than the vector control. in contrast to vapb- <dig> and vapc- <dig>  no significant difference was observed between the reciprocal fusions for vapx and vapd heterodimerization.

growth dynamics of cultivated nthi mutants
the growth behavior of the 86-028np parent strain and the Δvapbc- <dig>  Δvapxd, and Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd mutants was evaluated by culturing in sbhi for  <dig> h . the bacterial numbers of all the strains increased most rapidly during the first  <dig> hours of culture, followed by entry into stationary phase. no significant difference in growth dynamics was observed between the strains, demonstrating that any differences between the survival of the wild type parent strain and the mutants in primary human respiratory tissues or the chinchilla middle ear model was not attributable to a defect in replication under normal culture conditions.

ultrastructure of nthi mutants co-cultured with epiairway tissues
to assess the effects of the ta loci on the morphologic aspects of nthi invasion behavior, a primary human respiratory epithelial tissue model at the ali, the epiairway,  was used in long-term co-culture with the various strains. ultrastructure of the nthi strains was observed by tem on day  <dig> post-infection . the 86-028np parent strain , Δvapbc- <dig> , Δvapxd , and Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd mutants  all were found residing both apically and within the tissues. although nthi are pleomorphic by nature, the mutant organisms associated with the tissues were intact and no significant structural damage was observed in any of the mutant strains.

attenuation of the vap mutants in the epiairway tissue model
the epiairway model consists of primary, well-differentiated tissues with tight junctions, ciliated and nonciliated cells, mucin-producing goblet cells, and is an excellent in vitro representation of the human upper airway  <cit> . indeed, the transcriptional profile of respiratory epithelial cells cultured at the ali has been shown to closely resemble that of the in vivo airway epithelium  <cit> . to determine the contribution of the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd ta loci to nthi survival capability within primary human tissues, the 86-028np wild type, the Δvapbc- <dig>  Δvapxd, and Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd mutants were co-cultured with the epiairway tissues and the number of internalized  bacteria for each strain was enumerated over  <dig> days of co-culture . although each strain was inoculated at ~ <dig> cfu, the number of internalized wild type bacteria  was greater for all time points than those of the Δvapbc- <dig>  Δvapxd, or Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd mutant strains, which showed significantly lower survival levels over the  <dig> days of co-culture .

the vap mutants are attenuated in the chinchilla otitis media model
the chinchilla model of otitis media was employed to determine the survival of the nthi mutants over the course of a 4-day infection . after  <dig> days, an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml of the 86-028np parent strain was recovered from chinchilla middle ears. in contrast, the Δvapbc- <dig>  Δvapxd, and Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd mutants recovered from the infected middle ears were an average of  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> viable cfu/ml, respectively, all significantly lower than the wild type strain . the Δvapbc- <dig> mutant exhibited the lowest recovery numbers from the infected middle ears among all the tested strains . no significant difference between the recovered cfu numbers was observed for the Δvapxd single mutant and the Δvapbc- <dig> Δvapxd double mutant strain .

the vap mutants elicited lower levels of inflammation
it has been shown that even nonviable nthi  can induce an immune response in middle ear cells in vitro and in vivo <cit> . to determine if the numbers of viable organisms recovered from the chinchilla middle ears correlated with the inflammatory response, we sagittally step-sectioned middle ears of animals infected with either the wild type parent or each of the various mutant strains. subsequent hematoxylin-eosin  stains of each ear were randomized and blinded, then scored by one of us  for the extent of inflammation using a scale from  <dig>  to 4+ . examples of pbs control  and 86-028np infected  h&e-stained chinchilla middle ears are shown in figure  <dig>  consistent with the numbers of viable bacteria recovered, the middle ear sections from animals infected with the mutant strains exhibited less inflammation on average than the wild type parent strain . this suggests that the vap mutants were killed and cleared earlier in the infection process, supporting both the role of these ta operons in the pathogenesis of otitis media and the importance of these modules as new therapeutic targets.

a <dig> middle ears were scored for each challenge strain.

vapd displays ribonuclease activity
we have previously shown that vapc- <dig> is a ribonuclease  <cit> . since the Δvapxd mutant was also attenuated for survival in vitro and in vivo, we assayed the purified vapd toxin for rnase activity, and found that it was a potent ribonuclease . these data are consistent with a recent publication that demonstrated the ribonuclease activity of a vapd homologue from helicobacter pylori <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a rnase activity assay conducted over time using the rnasealert  substrate with increasing amounts of vapd protein. the single-stranded rna substrate has a quencher on one end and a fluorophore  on the other, and fluoresces brightly when cleaved. we included protein elution buffer, purified cat , and antitoxin vapx proteins as negative controls, which were overexpressed and purified in the identical fashion as vapd. the vapd protein displayed concentration-dependent rnase activity over time in this assay.

discussion
as classic type ii ta partners, vapb- <dig> and vapc- <dig> were previously found to functionally interact in regulating the ribonuclease activity of nthi vapc- <dig> in vitro <cit> . likewise, in another study, the presence of vapx was required to relieve the cell growth arrest caused by vapd  <cit> . here we demonstrate with a lexa detection system that both protein pairs also physically interact in vivo. based on the ta model hypothesis, these observations suggest that under favorable conditions, the antitoxins vapb- <dig> and vapx bind to and inhibit the toxins vapc- <dig> and vapd, respectively. during infections of nthi-caused otitis media, various stress stimuli such as nutrient deprivation, antibiotics, and reactive oxygen species encountered by the organisms might result in the release of the vapc- <dig> and vapd toxins from their degraded or inactivated cognate antitoxins vapb- <dig> and vapx, respectively. the mobilization of these toxins could then trigger or facilitate downstream events such as mrna decay of metabolism-related transcripts, driving the bacterial population into a stasis state and leading to a persistent infection of nthi in the middle ear of the host.

deletions of either or both of the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd ta loci did not change the cellular morphology of the organism during co-culture as revealed by tem examination, and the ability of the mutants to replicate normally in rich media was not affected. this indicates that the observed attenuation of persistence was not associated with detrimental changes in the morphologic structure or replication dynamics of the pathogen, but rather was attributable to the lack of the apparently protective effect of the vap pairs.

a common feature of type ii ta systems is a toxic enzyme activity that switches bacterial cells over to metabolic stasis under stressful conditions such as starvation  <cit>  as well as heat, osmotic and free radical-induced stress  <cit> . indeed, vapc toxin homologues from m. tuberculosis inhibited growth when expressed without their cognate vapb antitoxins in m. smegmatis <cit> . an obvious conclusion to be drawn from this conserved attribute is that, without the toxin present to facilitate a state of bacteriostasis, the organism could continue to replicate under conditions that would normally allow toxin activation followed by growth arrest. our data suggest that the loss of the ability to modulate replication is detrimental to nthi in our infection models. for example, the Δvapbc- <dig> mutant co-cultured with epiairway tissues displayed a marked attenuation of survival, suggesting that the vapbc- <dig> locus contributed significantly to persistence under these conditions. deletion of the vapxd locus or both vapbc- <dig> vapxd loci reduced nthi persistence to similar levels when co-cultured with the epiairway tissues, indicating that the vapxd locus was also involved in maintaining the nthi survival during extended infections. interestingly, during the early  and late  time points, the differences between the wild type and mutant strains were less marked than during days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the reasons for this phenotype are unclear, but it may be due to unregulated replication of the vap mutants within the epiairway tissues, which could result in nutrient deprivation-induced death after the first  <dig> hours of infection. we have recently shown by tem and immunoelectron microscopy that nthi are often located between the basal cells in these tissues  <cit> . while the apical surfaces of infected tissues were undamaged, the basal cells displayed wider intercellular junctions and pockets of necrotic debris. this is consistent with the hypothesis that the late  increases in mutant survival could be due to necrosis of a subset of basal respiratory epithelial cells, providing more nutrients to the vap mutants and allowing their numbers to approach that of the wild type strain.

our in vivo results further confirmed the epiairway findings by showing that the survival of all three mutants was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type strain after a 4-day infection in the chinchilla model of otitis media. the double deletion of vapbc- <dig> and vapxd did not increase the average attenuation of persistence in comparison to the single deletion of vapxd in either model. this lack of synergy suggests that neither locus serves as an agonist or antagonist for the other, but rather that each may act independently to modulate replication. moreover, consistent with the numbers of viable bacteria recovered, the inflammatory scores of the middle ear sections were lower for the mutants than for the wild type strain, although the animals were able to mount an effective inflammatory response after infection.

similar to our vapc- <dig> data  <cit> , we show that nthi vapd displays ribonuclease activity in vitro. this finding suggests that the toxins of both vap operons may play key roles in stress-induced post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via the mechanism of mrna cleavage. taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that both the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd ta loci function to maintain nthi survival and virulence. this is the first report, to our knowledge, of the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd loci playing a role in the pathogenesis of nthi infections in vivo. other conserved ta pairs have been suggested as novel antimicrobial targets  <cit> , and our data support the notion that ta deletion results in detrimental effects on nthi infection progression. further studies are proposed to determine the most effective way of interfering with toxin activity in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the vapbc- <dig> and vapxd ta loci enhance nthi survival and virulence during infection in vitro and in vivo using a mechanism of mrna cleavage, and that these conserved ta pairs represent new targets for the prophylaxis and therapy of otitis media and other nthi-caused mucosal diseases.
