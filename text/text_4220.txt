BACKGROUND
the contraceptive estrogen, ethinylestradiol  is an important contributor to the feminization of fish downstream from sewage treatment works  <cit> . this discovery was greatly facilitated by the use of vitellogenin  as a biomarker. vtg is produced in the liver of sexually maturing female fish under the influence of endogenous estrogen. normally, vtg is not expressed in males or juveniles, unless they are exposed to estrogens via water or food. both vtg mrna and protein in male and juvenile fish have thus become established biomarkers for exposure to environmental estrogens  <cit> . however, estrogens can effect gonadal sex differentiation of fish at concentration not sufficient to give rise to a measurable vtg response  <cit> . it has also been shown that life cycle exposure of fathead minnow to an inordinately low concentration of ee <dig>  was sufficient to decrease the egg fertilisation and to skew the sex ratios towards female <cit> . this suggests that more sensitive biomarkers would be useful. zona pellucida  genes may be more sensitive than vtg  <cit>  but their specificity for estrogens is not as clear  <cit> . additional, sensitive biomarkers would thus increase our possibilities to identify exposure to low, but biologically important concentrations of estrogens.

rapidly accumulating data on genomes and proteomes have increased the possibilities to use different types of discovery-driven methods in ecotoxicology  <cit> . the large number of potential responses that can be studied with microarrays renders the method suitable for identifying candidate biomarkers of exposure  <cit> . such candidates may then be further evaluated to find if they are useful as biomarkers. in general, a good biomarker should be sensitive, specific and robust. a robust response implies for example that it should be measurable at complex exposure situations, at different exposure concentrations, at different temperatures, after different exposure times, by different analytical approaches, in different labs and preferably also in different species.

the main objective of the present study was to use microarrays to find novel, sensitive and robust biomarkers of estrogenic exposure in fish. we have used a salmonid cdna microarray from cgrasp  <cit>  to analyze hepatic expression profiles in juvenile rainbow trout  exposed to ee <dig> in vivo. the responses identified at a high concentration of ee <dig> were used to guide the subsequent identification of generally more subtle responses at a low concentration of estrogen. we also identified estrogen-responses shared between fish species, experimental conditions and analytical platforms. this was achieved by a meta-analysis using our dataset together with results from three recently published articles describing hepatic gene expression profiles in fish exposed to estrogens  <cit> .

RESULTS
sensitive gene-expression changes
both male and female juvenile fish exposed to  <dig>  ng ee2/l were analyzed with microarray. the microarray analysis of female fish suggested that only three out of four females had an induced expression of the known estrogen-responsive gene zp <dig>  in contrast, an induction was present in all eight males. this observation suggested that some juvenile females may have sufficient endogenous estrogen to induce sensitive estrogen-responsive genes. thus, in our search for genes responding to low concentrations of estrogens only the microarray results from male fish were used.

thirty-six sets of cdnas  were regulated in male fish both by the low and the high concentration of ee <dig> . all of the cdnas responded in a dose-dependent manner. zp <dig> was the most differentially expressed gene in fish exposed to both high and low concentrations with a fold change of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. vtg was not affected by the low concentration while it was up-regulated  <dig> times by  <dig> ng ee2/l as measured by quantitative rt-pcr  .

cdnas or sets of cdna putatively sensitive to estrogen exposure as judged by the presence on the top 250-lists ranked by moderated t-statistics on both  <dig>  and  <dig> ng ee2/l exposure experiments in male juvenile rainbow trout. cdnas corresponding to genes that were selected for qpcr analysis are marked with bold text. note that several cdnas may likely correspond to the same gene.

robust gene-expression changes
a meta-analysis was performed with the aim to identify robust estrogen-responsive genes. the microarray data from fish  exposed to  <dig> ng/l from the present study and available microarray data from three other exposure studies with fish and estradiol  or ee <dig> were used in the meta-analysis  <cit> . information about the different studies is shown in table  <dig>  transcripts  presumably corresponding to  <dig> genes or groups of paralog genes were identified as differentially expressed in at least two of the four different studies . vtg and zp <dig> were differentially expressed in all four studies and nine genes had an altered expression in at least three studies . it should be noted that zp <dig> and the estrogen receptor-α, which are well-know estrogen-responsive genes in fish, have poor sequence representation on the cgrasp microarrays and are therefore not present in figure  <dig> 

number of matches a match is defined as a tblastx hit with a e-value less than 10- <dig> 

confirmation of microarray data with quantitative rt-pcr
genes that were likely to be both sensitive  and robust  were chosen for subsequent qpcr analysis. three genes fulfilled these criteria: zp <dig>  a nucleoside diphosphate kinase  and fatty acid binding protein  <dig> . in addition, vtg was subjected to the qpcr analysis as well as the reference gene ubiquitin. in accordance with the microarray results the expression of vtg, zp <dig> and nm <dig> were significantly induced in fish exposed to the high concentration. also, as suggested by the microarrays, zp <dig> and nm <dig> were significantly induced by the low concentration as well, whereas vtg expression was not induced . in stark contrast to the microarray results fabp <dig> had no tendency to any regulation caused by the treatment but showed a large variation within each treatment group . the fabp <dig> and nm <dig> qpcr products were sequenced in order to confirm the amplification of the right products and they were identical to fabp <dig> and nm <dig>  in rainbow trout .

discussion
our meta-analysis correctly identified some of the most well known estrogen-responsive genes . this suggests that the approach has a good potential to identify other robust, less well known estrogen-regulated genes. we also showed that zp <dig> and a hepatic nucleoside diphosphate kinase nm <dig> are more sensitive to estrogenic exposure than the widely used biomarker vtg. as far as we know, no other microarray study has identified the effects of as low concentrations of estrogen as used here. the recognition of nm <dig> induction as a highly sensitive response is therefore a novel finding. thus we propose that analyses of nm <dig> together with zp genes may increase the possibilities to detect an exposure to low levels of estrogenic compounds in fish. however, more studies are required in order to fully assess the potential of nm <dig> as a biomarker.

sensitive biomarkers can be used as early warning signals to indicate exposure and thus potential risk of adverse effects. it has been suggested that the induction of zp mrnas are more sensitive than induction of vtg  <cit> . however expression of zp genes can, as most genes, be affected by other environmental factors, for example cortisol exposure  <cit> . the regulation of a single gene is rarely sufficient to conclusively demonstrate a specific exposure, but a combination of responses would together potentially increase the degree of evidence.

we identified nine genes  that were affected by estrogen in at least three out of the four studies included in the meta-analysis. the known estrogen-responsive genes vtg and zp <dig> were up-regulated in all four studies. the robust gene expression changes of zp <dig>  nm <dig> and fabp <dig> were also tentatively identified to be sensitive. however, the induction of fabp <dig> was not confirmed by qpcr. the incorrect identification from microarray data might be explained by cross hybridization to related mrnas, a known problem for cdna microarrays. nm <dig>  on the other hand, was confirmed with qpcr to be significantly induced both by a low and a high water concentration of ee <dig>  in addition, microarray results from the other studies of rainbow trout exposed to  <dig> ng ee2/l and dietary exposed to  <dig> μg/g of e <dig> further supports an estrogen-induction of nm <dig> in rainbow trout during different exposure conditions  <cit> . the study of estrogen-exposed medaka did not report nm <dig> as an estrogen-responsive gene but it is unclear if nm <dig> was represented on the medaka microarray  <cit> . whether nm <dig> is regulated by estrogen in other fish species is still an open question, although mammalian studies suggest a conserved induction mechanism  <cit> .

nm <dig> belongs to a larger class of nucleoside disphophate kinases that exist in multiple isoforms and are highly conserved throughout evolution. the investigated nm <dig> have been sequenced in rainbow trout , atlantic salmon  and zebrafish . the salmon and zebrafish nm <dig> shows high similarity to the human nm23-h <dig> and h <dig> genes. a phylogenetic analysis suggests that nm23-h <dig> and h <dig> have arisen by gene duplication after the speciation event that gave rise to modern teleost fish and tetrapods  <cit> . therefore it is assumed that the salmonid genome would only have one gene homologue to the nm <dig> -h <dig> and -h <dig> genes. in mammals the nm23-h <dig> gene encodes the c-myc transcription factor and the nm23-h <dig> gene has been shown to be metastasis associated  <cit> . moreover, the nm23-h <dig> gene and protein is up-regulated by e2-treatment in human breast carcinoma cell lines. this induction seems to be mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level via the estrogen receptor α binding to an estrogen responsive element in the promoter region of the human nm23-h <dig>  <cit> . the physiological function of nm <dig> in fish remains to be determined as well as the possibilities of a regulation by other factors than estrogen  and the robustness of the response during more complex exposure scenarios.

to be useful as a biomarker, a response should ideally be as robust as possible. in the meta-analysis we tested gene responses for robustness between species, exposure conditions and analytical platforms. combining microarray data from different species and platforms is a challenging task, particularly when sequence information and good annotations are limited. we have addressed the cross platform/cross species comparison by using the zebrafish transcriptome as a reference. in contrast to most other fish species zebrafish has the advantage of being both well sequenced and well annotated. however, using zebrafish as a reference also has limitations, e.g. a lack of identified homologes for some genes. the results in the meta-analysis were also influenced by the shortage of available microarray raw data and therefore we had to accept the different statistical approaches used for selecting estrogen-responsive genes in the different studies.

it is certainly possible that more than nine hepatic genes are robustly regulated by estrogen in the analyzed species/conditions. we have only included comprehensive fish arrays in the meta-analysis. nevertheless, many genes are still likely to be represented on only one or a few of the array platforms which limits the possibility of identifying robust responses. the choice of microarray platform also affects the possibilities to accurately identify differentially expressed genes. amplicon arrays  show less concordance with other platforms, for example qpcr and commercially produced high density arrays with oligonucleotide probes or cdna arrays with synthetic oligonucleotides  <cit> . although, it has been shown that when two independent platforms give consistent results, the outcome of qpcr analysis will most often also be in agreement  <cit> . this adds confidence that several of the differentially expressed genes identified by the meta-analysis indeed are relatively robust responses.

by making the data on putative sensitive and/or robust gene responses public, it can be used as a base for further investigations on the effects of environmental estrogens in fish in order to develop biomarkers or to increase the understanding of the physiological impact of environmental estrogens.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used microarrays to identify a range of potentially sensitive and/or robust gene expression changes in fish exposed to estrogen. we have identified the induction of zp <dig> and a hepatic nm <dig> mrna as being both sensitive and presumably robust responses. after further evaluation, nm <dig> induction would therefore be a good candidate biomarker together with zp genes to reveal exposure to low levels of estrogens not sufficient to induce vtg but still with potential to affect gonadal differentiation of fish.
