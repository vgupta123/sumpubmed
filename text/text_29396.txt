BACKGROUND
to ensure that scientific results are both reproducible and consistent, a high level of integrity is required of experimental methods and microbial stocks. one assumption is that stocks are constant over time, such that contemporary isolates of a given strain are genetically and physiologically identical across laboratories, and to stocks from many years ago. however, before the widespread use of deep freezers or lyophilization, storage of stocks using agar slants and other methods permitted growth and metabolism, albeit slowly, over long periods of time. and as long as stocks are metabolically active, mutations are likely to appear. if these mutations are beneficial, they can be enriched or fixed in stocks and subsequent sub-cultures via natural selection; or, alternatively, practices such as plate streaking and colony picking could inadvertently propagate clones with neutral or even deleterious mutations due to random sampling or “genetic drift”. either way, such mutations are the bane of microbial stocks: they destroy the integrity of otherwise isogenic lines, and they become the raw material for processes such as selection and drift to facilitate evolutionary divergence in strains over time.

the slow accrual of mutations often goes unnoticed in laboratory strains, but can result in considerable genomic and phenotypic differences both between independent laboratory stocks, and between laboratory strains and their wild counterparts. this unintended mutational divergence is termed “laboratory domestication”, and is particularly common in many  microorganisms isolated prior to the widespread use of modern storage methods . for example, the domestication of bacillus subtilis to the lab is associated with a loss of biofilms  <cit> , swarming behavior  <cit> , and fruiting body formation   <cit> . stocks of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit>  and escherichia coli <cit>  archived for years or decades show a considerable amount of genetic diversity and novel phenotypes stemming from long-term growth and survival during storage in agar stabs. other controlled studies of microbes from the lab  <cit>  or the wild  <cit>  also show how growth, storage, and passaging procedures can readily lead to the diversification, divergence, and domestication of stocks. outside of microbes, examples of domestication have been documented in stocks of the nematode worm, c. elegans <cit> , and in independent stocks of laboratory mice  <cit> . in all these examples, understanding the extent to which laboratory domestication has occurred is important - not only for the standardization of experiments and the correct interpretation of results - but also because each instance of domestication is itself an interesting case-study of genomic and phenotypic divergence driven by a subtle and often cryptic set of evolutionary processes.

since the early 1960s, methylobacterium extorquens am <dig> has emerged as the predominant model system for studies of bacterial one-carbon metabolism. as a facultative methylotroph, m. extorquens am <dig>  has the ability to grow using reduced one-carbon  compounds such as methanol and methylamine as the sole source of carbon and energy, as well as multi-carbon  compounds such as succinate, pyruvate, and acetate  <cit> . the oxidation of methanol into biomass proceeds via the highly toxic intermediate, formaldehyde, and is complex, requiring over  <dig> enzymes  <cit> . a sequenced genome  <cit> , genetic tools  <cit> , optimized growth conditions  <cit> , metabolic models  <cit> , and extensive knowledge of both c <dig> and multi-c metabolism  <cit>  all make am <dig> the ideal organism for studies of methylotrophy in the lab, as well as an emerging system for experimental evolution  <cit> . aside from am <dig>  related methylobacteria are known for their roles in the plant microbiome  <cit> , the biodegradation of toxic chemicals like chloromethane  <cit>  and dichloromethane  <cit> , and their potential for use in industrial applications  <cit> .

unlike most organisms, the discovery and establishment of am <dig> as a model system was completely accidental. around the year  <dig>  dr. j.r. quayle and colleagues at the university of oxford were searching for a new organism in which to study the oxidation and assimilation of c <dig> compounds, but discovered in their medium a “heavy, pink growth, presumably due to some airborne contaminant”  <cit> . after the contaminant was isolated, it was found to grow rapidly on a variety of both c <dig> and multi-c compounds. shortly thereafter, a sample of am <dig> - then known as pseudomonas am <dig> for “airborne methylotroph #1” - was deposited to the national collection of industrial and marine bacteria , while a working stock remained in the lab. over the years, this working stock was maintained and propagated between different researchers, laboratories, and growth and storage conditions, all the way up to our own laboratory’s stock. these circumstances raise the question: to what extent has this am <dig> lineage diverged during its time in the lab?

to address this question, we sought to compare today’s am <dig> to its ancestor isolated circa  <dig>  or a close descendent of this ancestor. closely related strains of m. extorquens differ significantly in their gene content and metabolic capabilities  <cit> , making these a less than ideal comparison to determine the ancestral “wild” am <dig> state. luckily, however, we realized that two major lineages of am <dig> were established circa 1960: the stock archived circa  <dig> at the culture stock center ; and the working line of am <dig> that was propagated over many years from j.r. quayle’s lab, to mary lidstrom’s group, to our own laboratory stock of “modern” am <dig> . we hypothesized that the archival am <dig> – which underwent longer periods of lyophilized storage with fewer growth cycles in between – might better-reflect the ancestral state of am <dig> circa  <dig>  and offer an excellent reference with which to identify evolutionary divergence in the laboratory-maintained am <dig> lineage. we document here the surprising extent to which our modern am <dig> has changed during its time in the lab using various assays of growth and fitness, long-term growth and storage, and whole-genome sequencing of the archival am <dig> strain. we then offer a discussion of specific laboratory practices and evolutionary processes that may have led to such divergence.

RESULTS
whole-genome sequencing reveals extensive genomic divergence in the modern am <dig> lineage
to explore the extent to which am <dig> has diverged at the genomic level, we used whole-genome sequencing to compare the archival genome to a previously sequenced modern reference  <cit> . illumina sequencing reads were analyzed both by mapping onto the modern reference, and through de novo sequence assembly. for sites in which these strains differed, we compared the mutational state at each site  to other previously sequenced strains of m. extorquens to determine whether substitutions occurred in either the modern or archival lineage . while this analysis cannot identify changes that occurred between the divergence of “wild” am <dig> from the archival/modern laboratory ancestor, these mutations, if any, would only add to the ways in which am <dig> has evolved in the lab.

our results identified a sizeable number and variety of mutations that separate the modern and archival strains. we discovered  <dig> snps,  <dig> small indels , the proliferation of  <dig> insertion sequence  elements, and some 36 kb of dna found in  <dig> de novo assembled contigs that are present in the archival strain but absent in modern am <dig> . for all but two of these mutations, excluding dna loss, the archival state is universally conserved with related m. extorquens strains to the exclusion of modern am <dig>  taken together, these results strongly suggest that this extensive genomic divergence occurred solely in the modern am <dig> lineage, while the archival am <dig> has been largely preserved.

mutations were identified by comparing the archival genome to a previously sequenced modern reference  <cit> . by comparing the mutational state  at each site to other previously sequenced strains of m. extorquens , all but two mutations can be unambiguously traced as having occurred on the branch from the ancestral to modern am <dig> . the effect of nonsynonymous mutations on coding regions are highlighted in bold and italic.

some modern mutations are likely to have far-reaching physiological consequences. certain mutations target highly pleiotropic genes such as rplj, which encodes the ribosomal subunit protein l10; rpob, the beta subunit of rna polymerase; and recg, the primary dna helicase involved in recombination repair and other functions. the insertion of mobile elements might also have altered physiology in the evolution of modern am <dig>  jumping into several putative protein-coding genes. still other mutations resulted in the loss of a substantial amount of dna from archival to modern am <dig>  deleted regions were typically flanked by insertion sequences and other low complexity dna, but in most instances we could infer the likely genomic location and content of these deletions . those genes deleted in modern am <dig> are predicted to perform a variety of functions, and appear in some instances to be homologs of genes found only in distantly related members of the methylobacterium genus. further insights into the extensive loss of dna in modern am <dig>  as well as the functional and evolutionary consequences of modern mutations, will require considerable future work. still, these results clearly show that the modern am <dig> lineage has undergone a substantial degree of evolutionary divergence and domestication over fifty years of growth and storage in the lab.

archival is faster and fitter under most standard growth conditions
to begin to explore the phenotypic differences arising in modern am <dig>  we compared the performance of modern and archival strains grown on standard growth substrates in “hypho” minimal medium. two primary metrics were used to assess growth: specific growth rate, determined from the increase in optical density  for a particular strain/condition using a custom-built, high-throughput microbial culturing system and analysis software  <cit> ; and relative fitness, which analyzes performance over multiple phases of bacterial growth  using a head-to-head competition of strains in co-culture  <cit> .

our initial hypothesis was that modern am <dig> would outperform the archival strain, owing to an increased likelihood of mutations in modern am <dig> that could facilitate adaptation to laboratory conditions. however, contrary to our expectations, we found that the archival strain was both faster and fitter under most conditions tested. the archival strain was considerably faster growing on the c <dig> compounds methanol  and methylamine , as well as the multi-c substrate succinate . in head-to-head fitness competitions, the archival strain showed roughly a 30% advantage across the substrates tested , suggesting that analyses of growth rate and fitness are not entirely correlated. nonetheless, these results show that the archival strain outperforms modern under most standard growth conditions, and suggest that the modern lineage became slower and less fit during its time in the lab.

modern outperforms the archival am <dig> on nutrient broth
we next sought to compare modern and archival am <dig> using less traditional growth substrates. in contrast to “hypho” minimal medium, nutrient broth  is a rich medium composed of partially digested proteins , but its exact nutritional components are largely undefined. today, nb is rarely used as a growth substrate for methylobacterium, and is used almost exclusively to support growth in co-cultures with e. coli during conjugal matings for genetic manipulation. it is possible, however, that modern am <dig> was more frequently cultured on nb in the past and may have adapted to growth on this medium. to test this hypothesis, we assessed the growth and fitness of modern and archival am <dig> cultured on nb.

we found over multiple different growth experiments that modern am <dig> consistently outperformed archival on nb, although both strains grew more poorly than on hypho medium. modern displayed a clear growth advantage on nb in 48-well plates , which could be traced in part to its relative insensitivity to perturbations arising during the later stages of nb growth. while monitoring the increase in od <dig> over time, we observed that nb cultures tended to slow down during the later stages of exponential growth, and that the archival strain was hindered to a greater extent than modern. this suggested that modern may have adapted to yet unknown components of growth in nb; however, due to this decrease during late exponential phase, we were unable to accurately assess differences in specific growth rate, and sought instead to quantify performance using a head-to-head competition of modern and archival co-cultures.

the performance of archival am <dig> co-cultured with a fluorescently labeled modern reference was monitored over the course of several days during growth in nb flasks. co-cultures were sampled periodically to monitor changes in the ratio of nonfluorescent  to fluorescent  cells using flow cytometry. these results suggest that the archival am <dig> holds an early growth advantage in nb that quickly decreases from  <dig> to 4 days until the strains reach stationary phase . as a control, a co-culture of nonfluorescent modern mixed with the same fluorescent modern reference showed little change over the course of the experiment. using the ratio of nonfluorescent to fluorescent cells at the start and the end of one growth cycle, we can calculate the fitness of the archival am <dig> relative to modern assuming a 64-fold  increase in the population , and find that archival is only 61% as fit as modern during growth on nb. overall, the improved performance of modern on nb is suggestive of adaption, either specifically to this medium, or to yet unknown but similar growth conditions.

archival and modern are similar in terms of long-term growth and storage
another dimension in which am <dig> may have adapted to life in the lab is through improved performance during long-term growth and storage. we compared the modern and archival strains grown for extended periods both in flasks and on plates by creating co-cultures of each strain with a fluorescently labeled modern reference, and monitoring the change in fluorescent to non-fluorescent cells over time using flow cytometry. growth in flasks was performed over  <dig> days with continual shaking using succinate as a growth substrate, while growth on methylamine plates was carried out at 30°c for  <dig> days, followed by up to  <dig> days at 4°c to simulate long-term storage.

here, modern and archival am <dig> were roughly equivalent in terms of growth and survival during stationary phase. in flasks, the ratio of unlabeled archival cells to labeled modern cells was steady for  <dig> days after the initial  <dig> days of exponential growth , while the unlabeled modern control remained unchanged for the duration of the experiment. archival held a similar advantage during storage at 4°c on agar plates for up to  <dig> days . collectively these results suggest that, at least under these conditions tested, the extent to which laboratory domestication improved the long-term growth and survival of am <dig> is limited, and that the major difference between these strains lies in decreased exponential phase growth in modern under standard conditions, and slightly increased growth on nb.

growth of am <dig> is significantly hampered by selection for rifamycin resistance
to explain the decreased performance of modern am <dig> under most growth conditions, we returned to the genomic changes identified in this lineage. all but one of the  <dig> mutations arising in modern am <dig> can be attributed to unintended laboratory domestication; this single exception, however, was central to the development of modern am <dig>  in  <dig>  fulton and colleagues selected for rifamycin resistance  to facilitate genetic manipulations in am <dig> using conjugative, tri-parental matings  <cit> . across numerous systems, mutations conferring rifr most often occur in the beta subunit of rna polymerase – encoded by rpob – and typically give rise to fitness tradeoffs between survival in the presence of antibiotics versus decreased growth in their absence  <cit> . compared to the archival strain, modern am <dig> has two mutations to the rpob locus , one of which  falls in a region that confers rifr in a variety of other organisms  <cit> , while the effect of the other  is yet unknown. at both positions the amino acid state of the archival strain is universally shared with other non-am <dig> strains of m. extorquens, suggesting that these mutations arose exclusively in the modern lineage. thus, these mutations to rpob, particularly q521r, are strong candidates for decreased overall performance in modern am1: offering resistance in the presence of rif but slower growth in its absence.

to explore the potential costs associated with antibiotic resistance, we recapitulated the evolution of rifr in independent replicate cultures of the archival strain. out of  <dig> independent populations grown to saturation, only  <dig> produced a small number of spontaneous, resistant colonies when plated on rif agar plates. each independent population was streaked to purity, analyzed in terms of growth rate on succinate , and sequenced along with the modern and archival strains at the rpob locus.

independent experiments recapitulating rifr in the archival strain all selected for mutations to rpob, and all resulted in decreased growth in the absence of antibiotic. upon sequencing rpob from the  <dig> newly evolved archival isolates, we found that rifr was always associated with mutations to rpob. one of these strains  acquired the exact same nonsynonymous change that occurred in modern evolution, corroborating our hypothesis that the q521r mutation  is causal in conferring rifr to modern am <dig>  indeed, all mutations observed fall within a region of rpob that is commonly mutated to confer rifr across a variety bacteria  <cit> .

the spectrum of rpob mutations across rifr archival isolates displayed highly variable effects on growth rate in the absence of antibiotic. compared to their archival ancestor, several rifr isolates show very little decrease in performance when grown on succinate, while other isolates slow to near modern levels, and still others grow substantially worse than modern . interestingly, the cm <dig> isolate that perfectly recapitulated the change from archival to modern am <dig>  was slightly faster than modern, suggesting perhaps that other mutations further hamper growth in the modern lineage. we note, however, that a direct comparison of this strain is difficult given that many other mutations and mutational interactions were likely present in modern am <dig> during the original selection for rifr. nevertheless, these results demonstrate that selection for rifr can substantially hinder growth of the archival strain in the absence of antibiotic, and that this single researcher-imposed event – not laboratory domestication - is the major mechanism by which modern am <dig> became slower growing in the lab.

discussion
this work highlights the surprising extent to which m. extorquens am <dig> has inadvertently diverged during fifty years of growth and storage in the lab. compared to an archival am <dig> strain, our modern am <dig> stock was slower growing under most standard laboratory conditions, and one mechanism to account for this decrease is in past selection for rifamycin resistance. indeed, the recapitulation of rifr in independently evolved populations of the archival strain frequently, but not always, led to a tradeoff between survival in the presence of antibiotic and decreased growth in its absence. upon sequencing the archival genome, we identified some  <dig> mutations that have accrued in the modern am <dig> lineage, including a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions, the proliferation of mobile elements, and the loss of some 36 kb of dna. though the full impact of these mutations for improving growth on nb or other conditions has yet to be revealed, it is clear that modern am <dig> has diverged substantially through laboratory domestication and changes stemming from selection for antibiotic resistance.

at first glance, it was not immediately clear why modern am <dig> had become slower and less fit under standard growth conditions. our initial hypothesis was that modern would outperform the archival strain due to the acquisition of mutations that optimized growth or survival in the laboratory, but our results suggested the contrary. alternative hypotheses to account for decreased performance in modern might include the chance acquisition of one or more mutations that are deleterious for growth, or that selection for mutations that improve growth under certain laboratory conditions generated tradeoffs in others. in the latter case, a strong candidate emerged in tradeoffs generated by selection for antibiotic resistance. antibiotic resistance in organisms often carries with it a fitness cost in the absence of antibiotic, and this has been documented in related strains to our modern am <dig>  <cit> . we discovered two mutations to rpob in our modern strain: one that is hypothesized to confer resistance , while the effect of the other is yet unknown but might serve a compensatory function  <cit> . reselecting for rifr in  <dig> independent populations of archival am <dig> resulted in a variety of mutations to rpob with variable effects on growth in the absence of antibiotic. one strain in particular  perfectly recapitulated the q521r mutation in modern am <dig>  and yet showed slightly faster growth than modern despite lacking any other known changes. while a direct comparison of this strain and the original selection for rifr in modern am <dig> is complicated by the presence of other mutations in the genetic background of the latter, these results strongly suggest that selection for rifr was the major factor affecting growth in the modern strain. given the large number of genomic changes identified in the modern lineage , it is somewhat surprising that the only mutation attributed to purposeful laboratory selection, and not domestication, accounts for much of the phenotypic divergence observed between the archival and modern strains.

though the exact circumstances under which modern am <dig> evolved cannot in most cases be ascertained, we can at least hypothesize as to the general factors that might have played a role. prior to the widespread use of −80°c freezers, long-term storage of am <dig> cultures was accomplished using hypho agar slants with methanol or methylamine  <cit> , most often under refrigeration. a study of salmonella <cit>  and e. coli <cit>  archived for decades under similar conditions revealed a number of genomic and physiological changes that aid in survival during long-term stationary phase. these conditions often select for mutants with a “growth advantage in stationary phase”  phenotype associated with increased catabolism of amino acids and other small organic compounds, as well as the ability to outcompete “younger” cultures  <cit> . although a gasp-like phenotype was not observed in the two test environments with which we compared modern versus archival am <dig>  further experiments might reveal conditions in which modern am <dig> has adapted to other facets of laboratory growth or storage. one particularly interesting direction is in the advantage of modern on nb, which may have evolved specifically to this medium or merely correlate with improvements in other conditions, such as the ability to survive long-term growth with limiting nutrients. along these lines, we analyzed the growth of rifr strains  on nb and found that they performed equally as well, if not worse, than their archival parent strain . this suggests that improved growth of modern on nb is due to one or more mutations that arose during laboratory domestication, not through the rpob mutation associated with rifr.

between long periods of storage, modern am <dig> may have also adapted to yet unknown growth conditions. the specific components of growth media can act as a strong selective pressure in microbial cultures  <cit> , and over many years modern am <dig> experienced both numerous variants of minimal media, as well as occasional growths in rich media like nb. large populations of microorganisms competing for limiting resources can create strong selective pressures for increased growth rate, which may have accrued in modern am <dig> only to be partly nullified due to later tradeoffs with rifr. it is also possible that some mutations were fixed not through selection for improved performance in laboratory conditions, but rather via genetic drift stemming from practices that result in extreme population bottlenecks, such as colony picking. given the complex and overall vague history of modern am <dig> in the lab, reconstructing the exact mechanisms that drove its evolution might be best accomplished by studying other “offshoots” of the laboratory-maintained modern lineage, and by characterizing the selective effect of modern mutations in the archival genetic background using allelic exchange.

CONCLUSIONS
the laboratory environment affords researchers with a great degree of control over experimental variables: from reagents and protocols, to the genotype of their model microbe, and the environment in which it lives in. examples of laboratory domestication, however, highlight the difficulty of maintaining high quality microbial stocks. mutations can jeopardize the integrity of microbial stocks and, given time, lead to spurious and inconsistent results stemming from the evolutionary divergence of strains. even purposeful laboratory experiments intended merely to select for antibiotic resistance or otherwise alter the genetic background of strains can have unanticipated pleiotropic effects. thus, extra care should be taken to ensure that experimental findings from strains are reproducible and consistent over time. for those stocks in which divergence has already occurred, these microbes offer a unique opportunity to explore genetic and phenotypic changes resulting from complex evolutionary processes at work in the lab.
