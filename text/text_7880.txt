BACKGROUND
when people identify an object, they have to match what they sense against their knowledge. in general, people accomplish recognition by a combination of two information processing pathways: top-down and bottom-up. bottom-up processing  occurs when the sensory input information induces perceptual representation, whereas top-down processing  occurs when the perceptual representation is influenced by some higher mental function such as previous knowledge, motivation, or expectation.

to facilitate perceptual identification, one may use subjective expectations of the stimulus to come. accordingly, a cognitive intention , embedded in a top-down process, may precede an event or stimulus. bottom-up sensory processing is then guided by such top-down processing as a specific reallocation of attention relevant to the type of stimulus to follow or task to be performed. in this way, top-down intentional processing can increase the speed and efficiency of perceptual identification.

in this regard, the influence of prestimulus mental activity on the subsequent poststimulus responses  is worth investigating. indeed, some studies showed the relationship between the prestimulus alpha activity and the poststimulus event-related potential  components. brandt's and barry's groups have reported that greater prestimulus alpha amplitude led to larger erp amplitudes  <cit> , whereas başar's group has found an inverse relation between prestimulus root-mean-square  alpha power and subsequent erp amplitudes  <cit> . as it is known, erps are based on the recording of brain electrical potentials synchronized with the presentation of external sensory stimuli  as well as the occurrence of internal cognitive events   <cit> . likewise, there is still a fundamental debate on whether erp components are generated from the ongoing eeg activity  by means of phase-reset  <cit> . in general, erp components are influenced by bottom-up  factors and also reflect top-down  processing. however, since those studies show inconsistent observations, the relationship between the prestimulus alpha power and the poststimulus erp components has been still controversial.

meanwhile, using a color-shape discrimination task, min and herrmann  <cit>  recently found that the prestimulus level of alpha activity differed significantly with the type of poststimulus task, and interpreted this to mean that prestimulus alpha activity reflects top-down preparation for the stimulus. accordingly, the prestimulus mental state, typically regarded as a resting state and thus a baseline for poststimulus activity, may in fact be a task-relevant top-down control stage. some previous studies consistently support this conception  <cit> . for instance, ergenoglu et al.  <cit>  observed that alpha activity modulates visual detection performance in humans.

besides, klimesch et al.  <cit>  postulated that alpha synchronization might reflect a top-down function in inhibiting task-irrelevant information, since the event-related synchronization in the alpha band can be noticeably observed during task-performance either under such conditions where subjects have to withhold task-relevant information or over the brain regions that are task-irrelevant  <cit> . therefore, by means of two kinds of discrimination tasks requiring inhibition of concurrent task-irrelevant feature processing for improving task-performance, here we would like to test a putative relationship between prestimulus eeg dynamics and poststimulus responses of task-performance from the viewpoint of top-down inhibitory preparation to the task-irrelevant feature of subsequently presented stimuli. moreover, mordkoff and yantis  <cit>  reported that coactivation occurs when target attributes from two separable dimensions are simultaneously present, but not when target attributes come from the same dimension. they argued dividing attention between color and shape as evidence of coactivation. to induce such coactivation, we employed target attributes from two dimensions . this required subjects to inhibit the task-irrelevant feature to improve performance. presumably, different task-difficulties across the color and shape tasks may induce differences in top-down preparation such as prestimulus task-performance strategy.

in addition, theta activity has received attention as a possible electrophysiological correlate of top-down processing. it has been reported that spontaneous eeg theta activity influences the amplitude of frontal visual evoked potentials  <cit> , and that freunberger et al.  <cit>  suggested that phase-locked theta activity reflects top-down regulation in information memory systems. sauseng et al.  <cit>  also suggested that theta activity may represent top-down processing, and gamma activity bottom-up processing, based on observations of enhanced phase-synchrony between theta and gamma bands for an attended visual target. studies consistently suggest that slow oscillations  are related to function in large, distributed networks  <cit> , whereas high frequency oscillations  are associated with neural processes in more local networks  <cit> . these studies support the conclusion that integration between top-down processes depends critically on slow oscillations such as alpha and theta.

most studies on theta oscillations as a measure of top-down processes have focused on event-related  modulations, and thus neglect prestimulus theta activity as ongoing top-down preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks. note that a prestimulus mental state differs from a spontaneous mental state  in that mental activity in a prestimulus period would be influenced by the attributes of subsequent tasks or events. the prestimulus mental state may therefore present an appropriate target to explore differences in top-down regulation in advance of different task performances. we hypothesized that if theta activity reflects top-down processing, it must be largely controlled by ongoing top-down inhibitory processing, particularly during a prestimulus mental state almost entirely lacking in physical attributes of upcoming stimuli . in the present study we therefore investigated whether prestimulus theta activity represents a state of cognitive readiness, as prestimulus alpha activity does  <cit> .

RESULTS
pairs of colored figures randomly drawn from a set of red or green circles or squares were presented, and participants were requested to respond with the index finger of one hand if the target feature of the task  was the same and to respond with the other hand if it was not. as a result, the shape task yielded significantly longer reaction times than the color task  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; color task:  <dig> ms, shape task:  <dig> ms). for the accuracy of the task-performance, we also found a strong 'task' effect  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), indicating that the color task performance showed significantly higher accuracy than the shape task performance .

as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  we observed the significant main effect of 'task'  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) with higher prestimulus total alpha power for the shape task . we also found that the shape task was preceded by significantly higher prestimulus total theta power than the color task  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; color task:  <dig>  μv <dig>  shape task:  <dig>  μv2). in addition, we observed that the anterior roi showed significantly higher prestimulus total theta power than the posterior roi  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; anterior roi:  <dig>  μv <dig>  posterior roi:  <dig>  μv2; cf. figs.  <dig> and 2).

compared to the posterior region, the anterior region showed significantly higher poststimulus total power of both alpha  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; anterior roi:  <dig>  μv <dig>  posterior roi:  <dig>  μv2) and theta activity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; anterior roi:  <dig>  μv <dig>  posterior roi:  <dig>  μv2). in addition, the shape task showed significantly lower poststimulus alpha power than the color task  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; color task:  <dig>  μv <dig>  shape task:  <dig>  μv2). however, the 'task' factor did not have a significant effect on the poststimulus theta power.

the topographical distributions for both alpha and theta power between the two tasks are presented in fig.  <dig>  as shown, the prestimulus anterior theta and posterior alpha power were more intense in the shape task than in the color task. fig.  <dig> shows grand-averaged time-frequency representations of power for total activity on the anterior and posterior rois. note that the theta power had its maximum after the stimulation, whereas the alpha power showed dominance and higher power before stimulation.

discussion
we observed more intense anterior theta and posterior alpha power in the prestimulus phase of the shape task than of the color task. one might possibly suspect that the effects of prestimulus activity come from prolonged poststimulus responses. to validate the present effects as prestimulus effects, we performed an additional experiment with longer inter-stimulus intervals . eventually, the same results were consistently obtained although we replicated the experiment with longer isis . therefore, one can exclude a possibility that prestimulus effects are confounded by tailing of poststimulus responses. moreover, since the prestimulus oscillatory activity was measured sufficiently far from the mean latency for button-responses , our observations in the prestimulus period are also out of the possible confounding ranges by response-related brain activity.

based on behavioral results, the color feature may be more salient, and thus harder to ignore than the shape feature, in the successful performance of the shape task  <cit> . to suppress such salient task-irrelevant information as color, the shape task may demand more attention-readiness. the present study extends previous findings that prestimulus alpha activity reflects 'cognitive readiness' for an upcoming task  <cit> , with evidence that prestimulus theta activity may have similar functional significance. it is noteworthy that theta power showed its greatest intensity in the medial frontal region . based on previous studies  <cit> , frontal midline theta activity seems to principally reflect alternative activation of the anterior cingulate cortex  and prefrontal cortex. wang et al.  <cit>  suggested that theta activity from the acc might reflect active inhibition. they observed transient phase locking of task-relevant theta activity in relation to active inhibition in superficial cingulated layers. yordanova et al.  <cit>  also proposed that theta oscillations particularly in relation to movement execution are functionally associated with error monitoring, of which the acc is mainly in charge  <cit> . in line with these findings, hanslmayr et al.  <cit>  reported that theta activity in the acc increased linearly with increasing interference during the stroop task, and concluded that sustained phase coupling between the acc and the prefrontal cortex most likely reflects the engagement of cognitive control mechanisms. these findings support a significant relationship between frontal midline theta activity and inhibitory control of task-irrelevant processing. as task difficulty increased in the present study, the demand for inhibitory control in cognitive preparation most likely increased, and resulted in significant differences in theta power levels between the two tasks. this interpretation is in accordance with the assumption by klimesch et al.  <cit>  that theta power reflects  task difficulty and cognitive load.

a recent eeg-fmri study  <cit>  also showed enhancement of frontal theta and occipital alpha power during a modified sternberg working memory task. while we observed modulations of anterior theta and posterior alpha power in the prestimulus period, they reported similar phenomena in the 'maintenance' phase during a working memory task. our present observations in the prestimulus period and their observations in a working memory retention phase are all consistent with modulation of alpha and theta frequency bands depending on the current cognitive load. understandably, the mental load increases with the attention a task demands, and induces greater alertness, which can help either strengthened inhibition of task-irrelevant processing or enhanced attention to task-relevant processing. these different experimental phases  may in fact represent analogous mental states, and thus share in part the same neural networks.

to integrate top-down influences into bottom-up information requires long-range communications, which slow oscillations such as alpha and theta activities might achieve  <cit> . the interplay between alpha and theta oscillations may, for example, reflect the transfer of information between memory systems  <cit> , and the central executive functions of working memory may be reflected in the fronto-parietal coherence in alpha and theta bands  <cit> . since the functional coupling between anterior and posterior brain regions may be essential to accomplish top-down control  <cit> , the interactions between anterior theta and posterior alpha activities and top-down regulation processing must be explored in future research.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study extends our previous findings that prestimulus alpha activity reflects ongoing top-down preparation for the performance of upcoming tasks  <cit> , by evidence that prestimulus theta activity may have similar functional significance. based on both behavioral and electrophysiological results, the difficult task , which requires more inhibition of the competing color feature, was preceded by significantly higher alpha and theta power as compared to the easy task . since such task-differences were reflected in both alpha and theta activities prior to stimulus onset, both prestimulus alpha and prestimulus theta activities may reflect top-down cognitive processing in preparation for the performance of subsequent tasks.
