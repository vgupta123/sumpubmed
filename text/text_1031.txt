BACKGROUND
the shift from petroleum-based industry to a greener bio-based platform is expedited by an increasing concern of global warming. lignocellulosic plant biomass has attracted attention as a renewable resource for production of biofuels and commodity chemicals in biorefinery. lignocellulosic materials consist mainly of three different types of biopolymers:  cellulose, a linear homopolymer of d-glucose organized into highly crystalline microfibers which are intimately associated with an intricate network of  hemicellulose, an amorphous branched polymer comprising various pentoses, hexoses, and sugar acids, and  lignin, a heteropolymer of phenolic alcohols which shields the polysaccharide microstructure from external physical, chemical, and biological attacks. these biopolymers are organized into a complex and highly recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure  <cit> .

in nature, lignocelluloses are degraded by the cooperation of various microorganisms, capable of producing an array of cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic, and ligninoloytic enzymes  <cit> . cellulases and hemicellulases are mainly composed of various hydrolytic enzymes in different glycosyl hydrolase  families acting synergistically. cellulases comprise three major groups of enzymes:  endoglucanases , which attack regions of low crystallinity in cellulose fibers, creating free chain-ends;  exo-glucanases or cellobiohydrolases  which further degrade the molecule by cleaving cellobiose from the free-chain ends; and  β-glucosidases  which hydrolyze cellobiose to produce glucose  <cit> . in addition to the three major groups of cellulases, there are a number of endo- and exo-acting enzymes that attack the heterogeneous hemicelluloses, such as endo-β- <dig> -xylanase, β-xylosidase, galactomannanase, glucomannanase, and acetylesterase. a challenge for development of a feasible biomass industry is identifying efficient lignocellulolytic microbes and developing an active enzyme system based on synergism of the major glycosyl hydrolases and the non-hydrolytic auxiliary components   <cit> . these molecular systems are required for efficient hydrolysis of lignocelluloses to sugars, the key intermediates for subsequent conversion to biorefinery products.

aerobic fungi belonging to phylum ascomycota are important plant biomass degraders capable of secreting an array of glycosyl hydrolases and non-hydrolytic auxiliary components. several ascomycetes are commonly used for producing cellulases and hemicellulases in industry, e.g. trichoderma, aspergillus, and talaromyces  <cit> . enzymes from these fungi are different in their composite activities and enzyme components, which have different catalytic characteristics on lignocellulose decomposition. chaetomium is a saprophytic fungus belonging to ascomycota with high capability on degrading plant materials  <cit> . most studies on chaetomium, particularly on c. globosum have focused on laccases  while there have been few studies on their cellulolytic enzyme systems  <cit> . in this study, a biomass degrading enzyme system of the soft-rot fungus c. globosum bcc <dig> was studied. the crude enzyme was characterized for its catalytic activities and its components identified by proteomics. the crude enzyme was used for formulation of an efficient biomass-degrading enzyme mixture by a mixture design approach and applied for hydrolysis of alkaline-pretreated rice straw. the work provides an alternative lignocellulose-degrading enzyme system potent for on-site enzyme production for the development of a feasible biorefinery industry.

synergistic action of c. globosum enzyme to commercial enzymes
interactions among the c. globosum enzyme , novozyme® <dig> and accellerase®xy were studied using experimental mixture design approach  <cit>  with a fixed total enzyme volume  <cit> . the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions of 1 ml total volume contained 5%  alkaline-pretreated biomass in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer  supplemented with 1 mm sodium azide and incubated at  <dig> °c for 48 h with rotary shaking at 200 rpm. an optimal enzyme mixture releasing the highest reducing sugar yield was defined by a { <dig> }-augmented simplex lattice design using minitab  <dig>  software . the design contained  <dig> experimental points , which were performed in quadruplicate with three components and a lattice degree of three. the three independent variables in the mixture design consisted of cg-cel , novozyme® <dig> , and accellerase®xy . the sum of all enzyme components in the reactions were 100% with the total enzyme volume fixed at 80 μl. the amount of released reducing sugar  was used as dependent variables for simulation of the respondent model equation. the amount of reducing sugars liberated at the end of the reactions was determined using the dns method at the end of the reaction  <cit> . the sugar profile in the hydrolyzates was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography  equipped with a differential refractometer using an aminex hpx-87h column . the column temperature was  <dig> °c. h2so <dig> solution  was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min. concentration of sugar was determined from the calibration curve of standard solution. the experiments were performed in quadruplicate. sugars from control reactions containing heat-inactivated enzymes were subtracted from the data.

RESULTS
optimization of enzyme production conditions
production of cellulolytic enzyme from c. globosum bcc <dig> by submerged fermentation was studied. the optimization study included three variables:  concentration of avicel®,  concentration of lactose, and  initial ph previously identified to show significant effects  on cellulase level of the fungus in the preliminary screening of factors influencing enzyme production. according to table  <dig>  the basic fermentation condition containing avicel® as the sole carbon source  resulted in the cmcase and fpase activity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/ml, respectively. further increases in avicel®  did not enhance the target enzymatic activities. addition of lactose  was found to significantly  induce cellulase production level when compared with the same conditions in the absence of lactose. higher cellulase productivity was found at acidic ph  compared with that observed under neutral conditions. the highest cmcase and fpase activities of  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  fpu/ml, respectively, were recorded after 144 h of fermentation in run no.  <dig> containing 1% lactose and an inducer with controlled ph at  <dig> . this up-regulation of cellulase by lactose was previously reported in c. papyrosolvens  <cit>  and a. cellulolyticus  <cit>  where lactose was shown to act as an effective inducer of cellulase biosynthesis, which is controlled by a regulator protein responsive to the concentration of the target substrate  <cit> . the preference for acidic ph for production of cellulase and other lignocellulose degrading enzymes has been reported for most cellulase producing ascomycetes fungi e.g. t. reesei  <cit> , a. cellulolyticus  <cit> , and c. globosum  <cit> . this preference is related to ph for optimal growth and catalytic activity of the enzymes.table  <dig> effects of variables to cellulase activities in fermentation of bcc5776




addition of epfb as a co-substrate at 1%  concentration under submerged fermentation was found to further improve the cellulase production by c. globosum bcc <dig>  this led to the enhancement of endo-glucanase  and total cellulase  activities to  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  fpu/ml, equivalent to  <dig> and 25% increases, respectively, compared with those obtained in its absence . the use of agro-industrial wastes as the sole carbon source or in combination with pure cellulose as an effective and cost-efficient substrate for production of plant biomass degrading enzymes e.g. cellulase, hemicellulase, and pectinase production has been demonstrated in many fungal strains . the cellulase activities produced by c. globosum in this study were in the same range  compared to several wild type fungi in genera aspergillus, acremonium, trichodema, and schizophyllum reported in many recent publications, which were in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  fpu/ml. the very high cellulase activities  were achieved by mutants or genetically modified fungal strains. comparison of cellulase activities produced by different fungal strains recently reported is shown in the additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of  cmcase and  fpase activities from c. globosum bcc <dig> under various conditions. the cultures were incubated at  <dig> °c for 144 h with continuous shaking at 200 rpm. control medium  of microcrystalline cellulose avicel® and 1%  of soybean meal in water); optimized medium  microcrystalline cellulose avicel®,  <dig> %  lactose, and 1%  soybean meal with 50 mm potassium phosphate, ph  <dig> ); optimized medium + 1%  epfb




the optimized enzyme production medium  was used for production of the crude enzyme  in a laboratory-scale fermenter. the enzyme showed similar composite activities to those obtained in the small scale experiments. the crude enzyme preparation  contained a relatively high level of endo-glucanase as shown by cmcase activity  with fpase activity . strong endo-β- <dig> -xylanase  and endo-β- <dig> -mannanase  activities were found together with other enzymes involved in plant polysaccharide degradation, such as pectinase  and amylase . however, regardless of the high activities of endo-acting glycosyl hydrolases, the crude enzyme exhibited substantially weak downstream activities i.e. β-glucosidase  and β-xylosidase  activities, which could limit degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses to sugars. the 5× concentrated enzyme contained the cellulase activity of  <dig>  fpu/ml while >90% activities of other enzymes were retained.table  <dig> the composite enzyme activity profiles of c. globosum bcc <dig> enzyme extracts

synergistic action of cg-cel and commercial enzymes
the mixture design approach was applied to study synergistic and cooperative interactions among cg-cel and a hemicellulase, accellerase®xy, and a β-glucosidase, novozyme® <dig>  chosen from our pre-screening study on identification of additive enzymes with complementing activities to the core cellulase . the measured response of this method was presumed to depend only on the enzyme proportion of the complements in the mixture. a { <dig> }-simplex lattice model was applied which comprised  <dig> experimental points located inside the triangular graph, in which the sum of the three component loading for every experimental point was always 100% based on a volumetric basis. according to this design, the cellulase dosages as fpu loading/g substrate of each experimental point was varied according to different proportions of cg-cel: novozyme®188:accellerase®xy. each point was operated in quadruplicate to minimize the effect of experimental error.fig.  <dig> comparative activity profiles of  cg-cel and the synergized enzymes  accellerase®xy and  novozyme® <dig>  the y-axis is in a logarithm base  <dig> scale 




the reducing sugar yield obtained from each experimental condition in the mixture design is summarized in table  <dig>  the standard deviation of all the data points was ≤ 5% of the mean. cg-cel, equivalent to the fpase activity of  <dig>  fpu/g , demonstrated a higher reducing sugar yield  than those obtained with the β-glucosidase novozyme® <dig>  and the hemicellulase accellerase®xy  alone. the binary combinations between cg-cel and accellerase®xy  led to slight increases in reducing sugar yields  compared with that of cg-cel alone, despite the lower total fpase dosage in the reaction . ternary mixtures of all three enzymes at specific compositions resulted in further increases in the total reducing sugar yields, with the maximal reducing sugar yield of  <dig>  mg/g  which contained a 4:1: <dig> ratio of bcc5776: novozyme®188: accellerase®xy, suggesting synergism of the three enzymes.table  <dig> design of experiment for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated rice straw and the associated response data

reactions  contained 5%  alkaline-pretreated rice straw in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, ph  <dig>  with a total enzyme volume of 80 μl and incubated at  <dig> °c for 48 h




the response data for the reducing sugar were then analyzed using multiple regression analysis from the linear to full cubic model. the full cubic model was found to be the best fitted model for the reducing sugar . the anova analysis of the full cubic model is illustrated in table  <dig>  for a single factor, cg-cel, novozyme® <dig>  accellerase®xy coefficients showed a positive correlation with the reducing sugar yield. marked synergisms between cg-cel and novozyme® <dig> or accellerase®xy were observed , with a weak synergistic interaction between novozyme® <dig> and accellerase®xy. the highest coefficient was observed for the cg-cel*novozyme®188*accellerase®xy, indicating strong interactions among these components. the fitted equation for the reducing sugar yield based on the significant terms is shown in eq. :table  <dig> the regression model analysis of the { <dig> } full cubic model

the responses of reducing sugar yield with respect to component combinations are represented by a ternary mixture contour plot . the area that emphasized the greatest reducing sugar was in the middle of the cg-cel and accellerase®xy axes, and near the bottom of the novozyme® <dig> vertex. this implies that a high level of reducing sugars could be achieved when cg-cel was the major component with novozyme® <dig> and accellerase®xy in the minority. the optimal enzyme combination based on the maximal reducing sugar yield was determined to be  <dig> % cg-cel,  <dig> % novozyme® <dig>  and  <dig> % accellerase®xy with a predicted reducing sugar yield of  <dig>  mg/g pretreated rice straw with the total cellulase activity of  <dig>  fpu/g. an experimental reducing experimental sugar yield of  <dig>  mg/g was obtained, validating the model. the ternary enzyme mixture was found to increase the yields of all major composite sugars  from hydrolysis of the pretreated rice straw. the glucose yield  obtained using the optimal enzyme mixture was  <dig>  mg/g, which was higher than that obtained using the individual enzymes . this led to the increase in glucose releasing efficiency from  <dig>  mg glucose/fpu from cg-cel alone by  <dig>  fold to  <dig>  mg glucose/fpu of the ternary optimal enzyme mixture.   <cit> . further increases in the total enzyme loading from 1×  to 4×  led to a stepwise increase in reducing sugar yield to  <dig>  mg/g and glucose released to  <dig>  mg/g; however, respective decreases in glucose releasing efficiency were observed at higher enzyme loadings .fig.  <dig> the contour plot of the experimental design optimization of the ternary enzyme complex. one hundred percent component amount is equal to 80 μl total reaction volume

proteomic analysis of bcc <dig> crude enzyme
in order to analyze the composite glycosyl hydrolases and accessory non-hydrolytic enzymes with functions on attacking lignocellulosic materials in cg-cel, the composite proteins in the secretome of bcc <dig>  was analyzed using lc/ms/ms. twenty seven different proteins were identified in cg-cel, from which 81% were annotated as functional proteins while the rest were classified as hypothetical proteins. the majority of them are hydrolytic enzymes attacking cellulose and hemicelluloses, with a substantial fraction of non-cellulosic polysaccharide hydrolyzing enzymes . most of them are closely related to homologous enzymes in neofusicoccum parvum ucrnp <dig> and other ascomycetes. the cellulose degrading enzymes were classified into various glycosyl hydrolase families and non-hydrolytic enzymes in different classes. the cellulolytic components are annotated as  <dig> endo-glucanases  and  <dig> cellobiohydrolases, including cbh-i , which attacks the reducing end of cellulose chain, and cbh-ii, which attacks the non-reducing end, releasing cellobiose units, in addition to one carbohydrate binding module .table  <dig> identification of the polysaccharide degrading enzymes in the secretome of chaetomium globosum bcc5776

a few hemicellulolytic enzymes were also identified in the bcc <dig> secretome. these included gh <dig> and  <dig> endo-β- <dig> -xylanase, a key endo-acting hemicellulase attacking xylan, the major component in hemicellulose in addition to exo-acting enzymes including a β-galactosidase  and α-mannosidase . non-hydrolytic counterparts included a cellobiose dehydrogenase acting on oxidizing cellodextrins, an intermediate in cellulose hydrolysis to their corresponding lactones, and a polysaccharide deacetylase functioning on acetyl group branches in hemicelluloses. the functions of both enzymes on synergistic and cooperative actions with core cellulases have been demonstrated  <cit> . other hydrolases in the secretome are mainly related to different classes of proteases, e.g. carboxypeptidase s <dig>  leucyl aminopeptidase, and tripeptidyl-peptidase  <dig>  no other non-cellulosic polysaccharide degrading enzymes e.g. amylases or pectinases were identified. the proteomic profiles of the secretome thus point to a lack of downstream cellulose degrading enzyme  and various hemicellulolytic components. the lack of these activities could explain why cg-cel is strongly synergistic with supplemented pure β-glucosidase and hemicellulases.

synergism of core cellulases with hemicellulases and auxiliary components in various classes of carbohydrate processing enzymes according to the carbohydrate active enzymes database   <cit>  has been demonstrated and could be applied for developing efficient enzyme systems for bioindustries. their synergistic interactions can be explained by several mechanisms . activities of upstream enzymes can be enhanced by cooperative action with downstream enzymes acting on degrading smaller substrates, for example, alleviation of cellobiohydrolase  inhibition by a β-d-glucosidase which cleaves cellobiose, the released product with an inhibitory effect to cbhs to glucose molecules  <cit> . synergism can also be resulted from the endo/exo effect between an endoglucanase which creates new, free cellodextrin chain ends for an exo-acting cbh  <cit>  as well as synergic action between different exoglucanases attacking the reducing and non-reducing ends of cellulose chains  <cit> . cooperative action of cellulases and hemicellulases can also increases accessibility to the target substrates of each other, providing synergisms between glycosyl hydrolases attacking different biopolymers in the plant cell wall  <cit> . physical modification of the substrates e.g. loosening of the crystalline region of cellulose by auxiliary proteins   <cit>  and non-hydrolytic enzymes   <cit>  which in overall, results in increased accessibility of the hydrolytic enzymes to the substrates has also been demonstrated. however, they were not annotated in the secretome of c. globosum in this study.

synergistic enzyme systems are developed by empirically determining combinations of different enzymes for optimal digestibility on specific lignocellulosic substrates in order to reduce enzyme usage without sacrificing the rate or yield from substrate hydrolysis. t. reesei cellulase, a well-known cellulase in biomass industry was shown to lack β-glucosidase activity, resulting in strong inhibition of the cellulase by accumulated cellobiose in the reaction. this inhibition can be overcome by addition of external β-glucosidase enzymes from different microbial origins  <cit> . the synergistic action of t. reesei cellulase with a crude enzyme mixture from a. aculeatus containing various cell wall polysaccharide degrading enzymes with strong downstream cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic activities and a non-catalytic bacterial expansin, acting on physical loosening of the crystalline region of cellulose fibers, on saccharification of alkaline pretreated rice straw was reported  <cit> . glycosyl hydrolases from the metagenome of microflora present in sugarcane bagasse can enhance reducing sugar yield of t. reesei cellulase  <cit> . a recent work also showed strong synergistic action of a commercial cellulase, acellerase® <dig> with an endo-xylanase, pectate lyase, and a hemicellulose side chain cleaving α-arabinofuranosidase  <cit> . these findings demonstrate the potential of formulating active synergistic enzyme systems from various microbial sources in order to maximize the hydrolysis efficiency on specific lignocellulosic substrates. the glucose releasing efficiency of the synergistic ternary enzyme system developed in this study was higher than that reported for accellerase® <dig>  and the synergistic enzyme systems based on that enzyme, which was in the range of 122–173 mg/fpu  <cit> . the efficiency of the ternary enzyme mixture is in the same range to that reported for a synergistic system comprising t. reesei cellulase, a crude enzyme from a. aculeatus and a bacterial expansin  <cit>   and between t. reesei cellulase and enzyme from a. awamori  <cit>  . the greater efficiency of the c. globosum enzyme system may depend though on the nature of the substrates and hydrolysis conditions. elucidation of synergized enzyme activities in this study thus provides a basis for further modification of the cg-cel enzyme either by complementation of lack activities by external in-house enzymes or genetic modification of the strain.

CONCLUSIONS
a biomass-degrading enzyme system from c. globosum bcc <dig> , a potent fungus for development of a cellulase producing strain for on-site enzyme production, was characterized. the primary cellulase activity can be augmented by other hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic accessory enzymes. the enzyme system shows a high degree of synergism with commercial β-glucosidase and hemicellulase. the optimal combination of cg-cel, β-glucosidase and hemicellulase was found, leading to marked improvement in the sugar releasing efficiency. the work provides an approach for designing an effective enzyme system with specificity for saccharification of lignocellulosic materials, including agricultural biomass for the biorefinery industry.
