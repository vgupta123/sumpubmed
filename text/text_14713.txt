BACKGROUND
all fungi are heterotrophic organisms, and the majority of fungal species rely solely upon plant tissues to meet their carbon  demands. in addition to saprotrophic fungi that decompose dead plant organic matter to acquire c, many fungi are biotrophs, forming intimate associations with living plant tissues. associations between plants and biotrophic fungi are ubiquitous in nature; most plants are colonized from leaf to root with multiple fungal species. the interactions between biotrophic fungi and their plant hosts range from mutually beneficial  to context-dependent beneficial interactions , to unilaterally antagonistic, potentially fatal pathogenic interactions.

in vascular plants, photosynthetically-derived c is delivered from source to sink tissues  via phloem and sieve elements in the form of the non-reducing disaccharide sucrose  <cit> . within plant sink tissues, sucrose is cleaved by extracellular invertase enzymes into equimolar concentrations of glucose and fructose. these monosaccharide molecules are then imported into plant cells via transport proteins and used either to meet cellular energy demands or as substrates for synthesizing other carbohydrate-containing storage molecules. the amount of sucrose allocated to various sink tissues is driven in part by the capacity of sink tissues to store or metabolize the imported carbohydrates   <cit> . thus, increased invertase enzyme activity and the resultant decline in sucrose concentrations in sink tissues is intimately tied to phloem unloading and carbon allocation in the plant  <cit> .

invertase enzymes belong to the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  group of carbohydrate active enzymes, where family membership is designated based upon amino acid sequence conservation  <cit> . gh <dig> is a polyspecific enzyme family comprised of genes encoding for invertase  activity, as well as inulinase , levanase , and particular fructosyltransferase  and fructosidase  activities  <cit> . gh <dig> enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of their target carbohydrate substrates, which include – depending upon the enzyme – sucrose, and various oligo- and polysaccharides such as the fructans levan and inulin. overall, the majority of enzymes in the gh <dig> family are functionally designated as invertase  <cit> . invertase targets the terminal β- <dig>  fructosidic bonds found in sucrose, inulin and levan. plants typically contain multiple genes encoding for invertase enzymes, some of which are secreted, and others which are expressed intracellularly  <cit> . invertase and other gh <dig> enzymes are not restricted to plants but are also known from bacteria and fungi  <cit> .

given the abundance of sucrose in living plant tissues, possession of functional gh <dig> genes that facilitate sucrose utilization would be seemingly advantageous for plant biotrophic fungi. fungal gh <dig> activity could enhance fungal growth in plant tissues where sucrose concentrations are high, such as in the phloem and the apoplastic spaces of source and sink tissues where phloem loading and unloading occurs, respectively. however, sucrose diversion from plants to fungi is clearly disadvantageous to plants if there is no mechanism by which plants can regulate the timing or amount of c acquired by their fungal partners. indeed, sucrolytic activity by fungal gh <dig> enzymes has been implicated in the invasive growth of several plant pathogenic fungi. uromyces fabae, a rust fungus infecting vicia faba, has been shown to specifically up-regulate its invertase expression during the plant infection process  <cit> . infection of hordeum distichum leaves by another pathogenic fungal biotroph, puccinia hordeii, has been shown to cause a significant reduction in sucrose and monosaccharide concentrations in the apoplast of these tissues  <cit> . thus, gh <dig> genes have been documented in several pathogenic fungal biotrophs and appear to be expressed in order to enhance c metabolism and access sucrose at infection sites. given that a large number of plant-associated fungi are mutualistic  rather than pathogenic, the expression of fungal invertase during some pathogen infection of plant tissues raises the important question: do non-pathogenic symbiotic fungi also express invertase in their hosts?

cultural studies of two fungal species that form mutualistic mycorrhizal associations, amanita muscaria and hebeloma crustuliniforme, showed that these species lacked invertase activity and failed to utilize sucrose as a c source in the absence of the plant host or host invertase enzyme  <cit> . studies of beech mycorrhizas have also shown that monosaccharides rather than sucrose were the c compounds taken up by symbiotic fungal cells  <cit> . these results have led some investigators to hypothesize that all mycorrhizal fungi lack both a sucrose uptake system and the ability to metabolize sucrose via gh <dig> enzymes, and that they instead must rely upon the action of plant invertase enzymes to gain access to plant-derived c  <cit> . in contrast, results from several other studies provide evidence that suggests some mycorrhizal species may possess invertase  <cit> , or may be able to grow on media with sucrose as a sole carbon source  <cit> . this disparity between results of different studies in conjunction with the fact that just a fraction of the phylogenetic and species diversity of mycorrhizal fungi have been examined for invertase activity  currently limits our ability to draw general conclusions regarding whether mycorrhizal fungal genomes encode gh <dig> genes for sucrose utilization. even less is known about these processes for other non-pathogenic biotrophic fungi, such as endophytic- and lichen-forming fungi .

to test the role of fungal gh <dig> genes in determining the mode of c acquisition and allocation in plant-fungal symbiosis we have investigated the evolution of gh <dig> genes throughout the fungi using a phylogenetic approach. recent sequencing of over  <dig> fungal genomes has allowed us to determine the number of gh <dig> genes throughout the fungal kingdom and to trace the evolution of the gene family as it has evolved through numerous ecological transitions. because the genomic data have largely emphasized plant and animal pathogenic fungi, we have also developed and implemented a pcr-based gh <dig> screening method for fungi. this approach allowed us to determine gh <dig> gene presence in obligately biotrophic fungi, many of which cannot be cultured  does gh <dig> gene presence and abundance positively correlate with a plant pathogenic ecological strategy; 2) do mycorrhizal, endophytic, and lichenic fungi typically possess or lack gh <dig> genes? within plant-associated fungi we hypothesize that gh <dig> gene presence may be negatively correlated with the degree of mutualism and its presence or absence may therefore serve as a general marker for the sign of interaction  between a plant and a fungus.

RESULTS
gh <dig> gene phylogeny from fungal genome data
seventy-six genomes from five fungal phyla were queried for gh <dig> gene presence:  <dig> basidiomycota,  <dig> ascomycota,  <dig> zygomycota,  <dig> chytridiomycota and  <dig> microsporidia. forty-eight fungal genomes contained one or more gh <dig> gene sequences for a total of  <dig> gh <dig> sequences. the remaining  <dig> harbored no detectable gh <dig> . nine sequences were manually edited to correct putative errors in their protein predictions, and an additional seven sequences were removed from the dataset entirely, due either to errors that could not be resolved or to redundancies in sequences retrieved by blast . the number of gh <dig> genes per genome ranges from 0– <dig>  fusarium oxysporum with  <dig> gh <dig> genes spanning  <dig> groups had the greatest number of genes of all fungi surveyed. it should be noted that these fungi vary in their degree of genome sequence coverage and this report of gh <dig> gene number must therefore be considered a minimum estimate until genome sequence efforts are completed.

phylogenetic analysis of all  <dig> gh <dig> sequences from fungal genomes revealed a total of nine well-supported clades, four of which are previously unknown from fungi . two sequences do not nest within any of the well-supported clades: the basidiomycete yeast, sporobolomyces roseus, which is basal to group  <dig>  and the ascomycete grass endophyte, epichloë festucae, placed sister to group  <dig>  gh <dig> groups one and eight are the largest overall, containing  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences, respectively. group  <dig> harbors all of the saccharomycetales and schizosaccharomycetales sequences, and for this reason was referred to by yuan et al.  <cit>  as the yeast invertase clade, though both filamentous ascomycete and basidiomycete sequences are also found in this group. all of the other groups are comprised entirely of filamentous ascomycete sequences except for group  <dig>  which contains puccinia graminis and phycomyces blakesleeanus gh <dig> sequences, and group  <dig>  which contains one gh <dig> sequence from the basidiomycete smut fungus ustilago maydis.

function and subcellular localization of gh <dig> groups
all genome sequences presented in this study contain conserved motifs that suggest that they code for functional enzymes and are supported as being members of the gh <dig> gene family   <cit> . gene functions assigned to this group of carbohydrate active enzymes include invertase, inulinase, and fructosyl transferase activities; these enzymes can be expressed either intracellularly or secreted, and in some cases – as has been reported for the s. cerevisiae gh <dig> group  <dig> sequence – the same gene product may be expressed both intra- and extracellularly  <cit> . groups  <dig>  and  <dig> in the gh <dig> phylogeny contain sequences with known invertase function. groups  <dig> and  <dig> sequence members exhibit inulinase activity and groups  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> cannot be assigned a specific function . subcellular localization analysis performed using the programs signalp v. <dig>   <cit>  and cello v.  <dig>   <cit>  concludes that groups  <dig> and  <dig> are expressed intracellularly, and the remaining clades are largely comprised of secreted enzymes.

fungal genome ancestral state reconstruction and phylogenetic independent contrasts
the fungal phylogeny inferred from the six rna polymerase genes yielded a well-resolved phylogeny with support for almost all nodes  and is consistent with recent phylogenetic hypotheses for fungi  <cit> . ancestral state reconstruction of gh <dig> gene number across this fungal genome phylogeny predicted the most recent common ancestor of fungi after the divergence of microsporidia and chytridiomycota possessed one gh <dig> gene. fourteen independent losses of all gh <dig> genes were predicted, which included ancestral nodes of many of the lineages containing animal pathogens: microsporidia, the onygenales , and the genus candida. the ancestor of the agaricomycetes also is predicted to have lost gh <dig> genes. in contrast, gene family expansion was reconstructed for nodes leading to clades containing plant pathogens, the eurotiales, helotiales and dothideomycetes. significant changes between parent and descendent nodes in the rate of gene loss and duplication  were detected on  <dig> and  <dig> branches respectively .

phylogenetic independent contrast analysis complements the gene family expansion and contraction patterns observed in the ancestral state reconstruction, which shows a correlation between gh <dig> gene family size and ecological strategy. both a positive correlation between gh <dig> gene number and plant pathogen status, and a negative correlation between animal pathogen status and gh <dig> gene number were statistically supported . however, the result for animal pathogens was only statistically significant when taxa that are primarily saprotrophic and only facultatively pathogenic  were not coded as pathogens. correlation between gh <dig> gene number and saprotrophic status were positive but not statistically supported; mycorrhizal and endophytic fungal genomes are too few  to conduct a pic analysis for these ecological strategies.

pic analysis was conducted for each ecological category with ecology treated as a binary state. for instances where species had ambiguous or multiple ecological states, separate analyses were run with the taxa in question coded both possible ways to determine the influence of the specific coding state for those taxa on the overall results. saprotroph  <dig>  cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus spp. are coded as non-saprotrophic; saprotroph  <dig> = c. neoformans and aspergillus spp. are coded as saprotrophic; animal path. <dig>  c. neoformans, aspergillus spp., and neosartorya fisheri are coded as animal pathogens; animal path.  <dig>  c. neoformans, aspergillus spp., and neosartorya fisheri are coded as non-animal pathogens. mnconall, average magnitude of independent contrast. sdconall, standard deviation of independent contrasts, n, number of contrasts. asterisk  symbols indicate p values less than  <dig> , which are considered statistically significant.

gh <dig> gene distribution in experimentally assayed fungi
given that plant symbiotic fungi are underrepresented in complete genome sequences, we used degenerate primers to examine the distribution of gh <dig> genes in a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse suite of symbiotic fungi, with a particular emphasis on mycorrhizal and basidiomycete taxa. we successfully obtained gh <dig> sequences for taxa that had previously been reported to exhibit invertase activity, schizophyllum commune  <cit> , pycnoporus cinnabarinus  <cit>  and rhizoscyphus ericae  <cit> , as well as for taxa chosen as positive controls, giving us reasonable confidence in the utility of this approach and the primers we designed for this purpose. a total of  <dig> fungal taxa were tested in total:  <dig> lichenic,  <dig> endophytic,  <dig> mycorrhizal fungi,  <dig> plant pathogens,  <dig> animal pathogen and  <dig> saprotrophs . several additional taxa tested have multiple possible ecological strategies,  <dig> saprotroph/endophytic,  <dig> saprotroph/plant pathogen, and  <dig> endophytic/mycorrhizal. overall, we detected gh <dig> genes in  <dig>  of the  <dig> fungal taxa that were assayed, and in all but one case , only one gh <dig> gene sequence was recovered . the majority of the sequences that we detected are members of the gh <dig> group  <dig> subfamily, although a small number of sequences belong to gh <dig> groups  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> 

data are categorized by ecology, and a separate tally is made of sequences belonging to the phylum ascomycota or basidiomycota. each category is further subdivided to differentiate data retrieved from genome databases  from that assayed by pcr .

both phylogeny and ecological strategy are important predictors of gh <dig> presence. overall, gh <dig> sequences were detected with significantly greater frequency in ascomycete taxa  than in basidiomycete taxa  . similar to the results found with fungal genome data, the animal pathogen taxa did not possess gh <dig> genes, while they were found in plant pathogens, though at a lower detection frequency than the genome data . gh <dig> genes were detected in the majority of endophytic fungi , and in nearly half of the lichenic fungi  as well as many saprotrophs . in contrast, of the  <dig> mycorrhizal and  <dig> mycorrhizal/endophytic fungal taxa surveyed, gh <dig> genes were detected in only  <dig> species: sebacina incrustans, elaphomyces cf. verruculosus, rhizoscyphus ericae, meliniomyces bicolor and phialophora finlandica, of which only one  is a member of the phylum basidiomycota , and the rest are ascomycota species. while only one mycorrhizal agaricomycetes species possessed a gh <dig> gene, a number of the saprotrophic agaricomycetes taxa tested positive for gh <dig> gene presence, suggesting that the paucity of gh <dig> genes found in mycorrhizal agaricomycetes is not due to the wholesale absence of the gene family in this clade.

the bayesian gh <dig> group  <dig> phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequence data demonstrated the placement of the new gh <dig> sequences acquired by pcr and sequencing among those retrieved from fungal genomes. a number of sequences were too short to include in the analysis, and the relatively short length of the sequenced fragments overall is likely responsible for the lack of statistical support for a number of branches . the gh <dig> group  <dig> gene phylogeny is markedly different than the species phylogeny. for example, basidiomycota sequences are found in five separate positions in the phylogeny, each nested within ascomycota. the polyporales-derived sequences form a clade, but the multiple sequences from russulales  do not form a clade. cryptococcus neoformans groups sister to lophodermium piceae within a clade of filamentous ascomycota , although posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood bootstrap support for the placement of c. neoformans are less than 95% and 70%, respectively.

discussion
sucrose is the primary compound used by most plants to transport carbon throughout their tissues, and its abundance within plants makes it a valuable carbon source for the many fungi that are obligate plant associates. in order to directly utilize sucrose, fungi must possess the necessary enzymes to cleave sucrose into its constituent monosaccharides. the aim of this study was to explore the distribution and abundance of gh <dig> genes that encode for sucrolytic activity in fungi in order to understand how the potential for sucrose utilization is structured within and among major ecological guilds and evolutionary lineages. using a combination of bioinformatics and pcr-based assays targeting the breadth of fungal phylogenetic and ecological diversity, we detected a total of nine well-supported subfamilies of fungal gh <dig> genes. the number of gh <dig> genes recovered from an individual species ranged from 0– <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies per taxon detected in the genome and experimental surveys, respectively. two of the nine gh <dig> groups found in fungi contained the majority of the sequences: group  <dig>  a secreted invertase enzyme, and group  <dig>  an intracellular enzyme of putative invertase function  <cit> . pic analysis of the fungal genome data showed gh <dig> gene abundance was significantly correlated with ecological strategy. gh <dig> abundance was negatively correlated with animal pathogenic fungi and positively correlated with plant biotrophic fungi – plant pathogens, endophytic and lichenic fungi – with the notable exception of mycorrhizal fungal taxa. few mycorrhizal fungal species were found to have gh <dig> genes when compared to other plant-associated fungi, only one of which belonged to the phylum basidiomycota. we also observed a phylogenetic signal in gh <dig> distribution among fungi, with greater gh <dig> gene prevalence found in the ascomycota than in the basidiomycota. in the following paragraphs we will consider the significance of gh <dig> distribution and abundance patterns for the evolutionary history of this gene family in fungi, the functional diversity both within and between ecological guilds of fungi, and its relevance for the sign and strength of ecological outcomes in plant-fungal interactions.

functional diversity within and among fungal ecological guilds
ecological strategy was an important predictor of both the presence and abundance of gh <dig> genes. at the coarsest level, there is a distinct difference in gh <dig> distribution between animal and plant-associated fungi, with the former generally lacking, and the latter generally possessing gh <dig> genes. it is logical that animal associates would lack sucrolytic capabilities because sucrose is neither synthesized by animals nor is it stored in their tissues. one notable exception is the presence of gh <dig> genes in ascosphaera apis, the causal agent of chalkbrood disease of honeybees, which can grow in the sucrose-rich environment of honeycombs and infects developing honeybee larvae  <cit> . a more refined view of plant-associated fungi also reveals distinctions among different ecological strategies within this more general classification. we detected gh <dig> genes in all plant pathogens for which whole genome sequences were available, and in 38% of those surveyed by pcr. they were also found in the majority  of endophytic fungi and a number  of lichen-forming fungi . gh <dig> genes were not only present in all plant pathogen genome sequences, but gh <dig> gene family size was also found to be expanding in this group, a pattern that has been shown for many gene families in plant pathogenic ascomycota genomes  <cit> . in contrast, gh <dig> genes were absent in the only currently completed mycorrhizal fungal genome, laccaria bicolor  <cit> , and in the vast majority of the mycorrhizal taxa that we tested experimentally, particularly those belonging to the basidiomycota.

while general trends were identified among ecological guilds of fungi, variation within guilds was also detected, highlighting potential functional diversity in c acquisition strategies harbored within an ecological guild, and plasticity of ecological strategy within individual taxa depending upon host identity or environmental conditions. although gh <dig> genes were rare in mycorrhizal fungi, they were not entirely absent. we found putatively functional gh <dig> gene copies in  <dig> of the  <dig> mycorrhizal taxa tested : four of the five taxa contained at least one gene copy from the secreted invertase group ; e. cf. verruculosus contained a copy from gh <dig> group  <dig>  an intracellularly-expressed putative invertase, and r. ericae contained both a gh <dig> group  <dig> gene and a second gh <dig> gene from group  <dig>  an intracellularly-expressed gene of uncertain function. while gene presence is not equivalent with enzyme activity, the presence of conserved motifs in these sequences, combined with data from pure culture studies documenting invertase activity in r. ericae  <cit> , provide good evidence that sucrose utilization facilitated by invertase activity is possible for this subset of mycorrhizal taxa. several of these species are also plastic in their ecological strategies, forming ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal and endophytic associations . if these gh <dig> genes are functional in these species, what is the timing and location of their expression? are they expressed within symbiotic tissues to increase c acquisition, and are they expressed during each of the possible ecological strategies? in the case of e. cf. verruculosus and r. ericae, which possess intracellular gh <dig> genes, do these taxa possess sucrose import systems? these remain open questions, but answering them will provide additional insight into the functional similarities and differences in c interactions among different plant-fungal symbioses, and could expand our model of c transfer in the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, which currently assumes sucrose import by fungi is not possible, and that sucrose hydrolysis is carried out solely by the plant partner  <cit> .

for species with uncertain or variable ecologies, gh <dig> gene presence may serve as an indicator of potential endophytic ability or biotrophic growth, as illustrated by the "wood-decay" species found to possess gh <dig> genes . while commonly thought of as saprotrophic, the wood decay fungi schizophyllum commune, pycnoporus spp., and several polyporales species that tested positive for gh <dig> presence can also grow endophytically inside attached limbs of temperate oak trees  <cit> , and stems of theobroma cacao  <cit>  and elaeis guineensis  <cit> . other endophyte surveys have also cultured members of the basidiomycota from woody tissues such as the inner bark  <cit> , and from conifer fine roots, which in some cases can exhibit a growth pattern and mantle morphology similar to that of ectomycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . phloem-containing tissues may select for those wood-decaying endophytes that can metabolize both cellulose and sucrose, and gh <dig> activity may play an important role in facilitating the establishment of these early-successional wood-decay fungi.

evolutionary history of gh <dig> genes in the basidiomycota
ancestral state reconstruction of gh <dig> gene numbers across the fungal genome phylogeny predicts  <dig> separate losses of gh <dig> genes. many of these losses are at nodes leading to terminal taxa that are obligate animal pathogens, but complete gh <dig> gene loss is also predicted for the most recent common ancestor of the agaricomycete lineage . using pcr assays we detected gh <dig> genes in only one of the  <dig> mycorrhizal agaricomycetes taxa tested, sebacina incrustans, which is a member of the order sebacinales, the most basal clade of agaricomycetes  <cit> . gh <dig> genes were also less commonly detected in non-mycorrhizal agaricomycetes than in ascomycota taxa, though they were not entirely absent. gh <dig> genes were detected in 30%  of non-mycorrhizal agaricomycetes belonging to four orders: agaricales, auriculariales, polyporales and russulales. these species were either saprotrophs, particularly those thought to be associated with wood decay, such as pycnoporus cinnabarinus and fomitopsis pinicola and the three peniophora species, or plant pathogens, such as exidia pithya. gh <dig> sequences from these basidiomycota classes did not form a monophyletic group in the gh <dig> group  <dig> phylogeny, and instead exhibited a punctate distribution across the gene phylogeny, possibly due to the difficulty of reconstructing the phylogeny because of the small size of the sequenced fragment or due to multiple independent gains by horizontal transfer. regardless of the mechanism, the possession of gh <dig> genes in the genome of agaricomycetes is a rapidly evolving trait.

comparisons between experimental data and genome data
one caveat to this research is that with incomplete genome sequence data and degenerate pcr-based assays, the estimates of gh <dig> gene number are merely lower estimates; additional copies may exist that were not detected. in the case of the genome data, although we only included genomes that had been sequenced to a reasonable level of coverage, until sequencing is complete it is possible that the actual number of gh <dig> genes in these genomes may differ from what we report here. when we compare the frequency of gh <dig> gene presence between the genome and experimental data separately for the ascomycota and basidiomycota data, we find that the frequency of gh <dig> gene occurrence is lower in the experimental data than in the genome data, though these differences are not statistically significant . this result is likely due to the fact that pcr-based assays will suffer from false negatives due to pcr bias, and this approach will never yield as complete of a picture as the entire genome data will, even in cases where care has been taken to design and test many degenerate primer pairs. in order to maximize gene detection, primers were anchored in conserved gene regions, tailored to specific gh <dig> genes and phylogenetic groups, and tested extensively in all possible combinations. those primer pairs ultimately chosen worked successfully across a wide range of taxa, and we were able to amplify the genes in taxa for which invertase enzyme activity had previously been reported, such as schizophyllum commune  <cit>  and rhizoscyphus ericae  <cit> . nonetheless, pcr-bias likely explains why fewer gene copies were detected relative to the genome data, particularly for gh <dig> gene copies outside of group  <dig>  however, in light of this limitation, there are a number of additional lines of evidence that give us confidence in our interpretation of the results with respect to the implications for fungal ecology.

comparisons between the genome data and the experimental data show the same patterns of gh <dig> gene frequency among phylogenetic groups and ecological guilds. for example, statistical analysis of the ascomycota genome data reveals significant differences in gh <dig> presence among ecological strategies, such that gh <dig> occurrence is greatest in plant pathogens, lowest in animal pathogens and intermediate in saprotrophs . this pattern is mirrored in the experimental data , though this result lacks statistical significance. similarly, both the genome data and the experimental data show that there is lower gh <dig> occurrence in the basidiomycota taxa relative to ascomycota taxa, though this result is statistically significant only in the experimental data. taken together, our ability to detect gh <dig> presence in taxa which have been determined to possess invertase activity, as well as the consistency in the patterns between the genome data and experimental data give us confidence in our evaluation of gh <dig> gene presence in ecological guilds for which genome data are currently unavailable or extremely sparse, such as for mycorrhizal fungi in the agaricomycetes, and lichenic and endophytic fungi in the ascomycota.

CONCLUSIONS
this study analyzed the distribution of gh <dig> genes from fungi to determine if there is a relationship between sucrolytic capability and ecological niche in plant symbiotic fungi. a strong signature of both ecological strategy and species phylogeny on gh <dig> gene number was determined based on data mining of complete genomes. extensive gene duplications of gh <dig> are observed in several groups of filamentous ascomycota such as fusarium and aspergillus. phylogenetic reconstructions showed that expansions of gh <dig> genes coincided with switches to a plant pathogenic habitat, and conversely loss of all gh <dig> genes was observed on branches leading to nearly all animal pathogens. experimental results using pcr targeting gh <dig> homologues from a diversity of plant-associated fungi found gh <dig> genes in the secreted subfamily  <dig> to be the most phylogenetically widespread.

we report for the first time the sequences of gh <dig> genes from endophytic, lichenic, and mycorrhizal fungi, highlighting the potential for functional diversity within these ecological guilds. gh <dig> genes were almost entirely absent among the large number of basidiomycota ectomycorhizal fungal species tested . reliance on plant gh <dig> enzyme activity for c acquisition in these symbionts supports earlier predictions of a general absence of invertase in mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> , and a highly evolved mutualistic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> , a remarkable scenario in light of the high degree of phylogenetic diversity spanned by mycorrhizal fungal taxa. whether the plant host is able to detect fungal invertase activity and use such a signal to differentiate antagonistic from mutualistic biotrophic symbionts is a completely speculative, though plausible hypothesis. additional experiments using gene disruption mutants to investigate plant response to fungal gh <dig> expressed in symbiotic tissues will be an important step in clarifying the role fungal gh <dig> genes play in a plant's ability to distinguish friend from foe.
