BACKGROUND
the advent of microarray technology has led to genome-wide interrogation of transcript abundance. numerous studies have characterised variation in human gene expression associated with cell and tissue type, environmental conditions or disease and these have led to a better understanding of biological pathways. for clinical purposes, gene expression signatures have been useful to classify tumours  <cit> , to identify diagnostic markers  <cit>  or patient groups that benefit from therapies  <cit>  and to understand infectious disease processes  <cit> .

alongside genome-wide association studies and upcoming sequencing studies, there is increasing interest in obtaining large-scale "omics" data from large biobanks and sample collections, including gene expression, proteomic and metabonomic profiling. these biobanks will rely on easy sample collection and handling using robust methodologies and sample storage over a prolonged time period. while the downstream gene expression profiling techniques using microarrays are very reliable for large-scale investigations, there are still challenges prior to microarray analysis including the choice of a relevant sample type and rna and cell isolation method. blood-based samples will continue to be one of the most readily available sources for gene expression studies in large-scale investigations. several strategies - ranging from paxgene  to the creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines  comprising a transformed single cell type - have been developed. other isolation methods attempt to generate a subset of cell types such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by the use of ficoll or lymphocyte subsets using magnetic beads.

peripheral blood contains a variety of cell types including erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells and platelets. in pbmcs, several cell types including neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, platelets, reticulocytes and erythrocytes are depleted. because each of the contributing cell types expresses a unique gene expression signature relating to its function, the relative proportions of the cell types affect the gene expression profile  <cit> . in addition, the relative proportions of the cell types can change rapidly following disease-related or inflammatory responses. clearly, this variability may confound the interpretation of gene expression differences between control and disease groups.

investigating gene expression profiles in homogeneous cell populations, such as t or b lymphocytes, that have a potential as markers of infection or disease, might resolve such variability and could have greater diagnostic power than whole blood profiles  <cit> . the extraction of more homogeneous cell populations, however, which is often laborious and difficult to standardize, involves manipulation of the cells and may influence the expression profiles  <cit> .

one source that is used extensively to study genetic influences on expression  <cit>  or to investigate host responses to pathogens  <cit>  is lcls. the substantial advantage of lcls over whole blood is that the impact of environmental influences or other cell types on expression is much reduced, allowing - in theory - a more powerful investigation of genetic influences. however, lcls are transformed and cultured under artificial conditions and may not represent the natural gene expression state in vivo due to a large percentage of pauciclonality combined with widespread monoallelic expression  <cit> .

in order for gene expression profiling in blood to become a reliable and reproducible tool in large-scale investigations, a better understanding of intra- and interindividual variability comparing used methods is needed. several studies have shown that the paxgene system using whole blood samples results in higher variability of gene expression profiles and a decrease in expressed genes compared to pbmc-based methods  <cit> . however, whitney et al. observed a higher variability of gene expression profiles in individuals with disease than among healthy individuals in blood, indicating the feasibility of using gene expression profiling in blood for disease detection and diagnosis  <cit> .

several studies have examined the variability and gene expression signatures in whole blood and pbmcs in healthy individuals using different cell and rna isolation procedures  <cit> . only one study investigated gene expression signatures of purified t- and b-lymphocytes and granulocytes  <cit>  and little work has been done to explore differences in gene expression profiles from lcls and b cell subsets. a comparison between the variability and gene expression signature of lcls to other blood-based subtypes is of particular relevance, given the extent to which this sample type is currently being used for expression quantitative trait loci studies  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated variability and consistency in gene expression profiles between five of the most common post venipuncture methods of cell and rna isolation: whole blood ), pbmcs, epstein-barr virus  transformed lcls, cd19-specific b-cells subsets , cd20-specific b-cells subsets . using samples from six individuals collected during two visits, we evaluated the differences and concordances of global gene expression profiles, the biological and technical variability seen in these approaches, cell-type specific gene expression signatures and their relevance to large-scale biobanking initiatives.

RESULTS
high reproducibility between visits and high variability between methods
to determine the effect of the cell and rna isolation method on global gene expression profiling, gene expression profiles for  <dig> out of  <dig> samples were successfully generated on illumina ref  <dig> arrays . the study design is shown in figure  <dig>  four samples failed gene expression profiling probably due to low yield or low quality . remaining samples were checked using unsupervised analysis .

to evaluate the reproducibility, variability and signal-noise ratio between the five cell and rna isolation methods, we examined variability between visits and probes. to explore visit variability , we calculated spearman rank sum correlations between the two visits across all probes after applying two common probe filters  and detection score). the correlations ranged between  <dig> - <dig>  for all probes,  <dig> - <dig>  for probes with sd >  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  for probes with detection score >  <dig>  indicating a higher reproducibility between visits using the detection score as a probe filter . these correlations  were higher than between random individuals. although pax showed a high reproducibility between visits, it provided significantly fewer detected probes  than the other isolation methods  . the percentage of variable probes  in pax, however, was significantly higher  compared with the other methods .

* spearman correlations are calculated between two visits for each matched or random individual for each method. spearman correlations are based on detected probes.

consistent with our findings, previous studies found a reduction of detected probes, lower gene expression signals and increased inter-individual variability as compared to pbmcs  <cit> . because the main differences between pax and pbmcs are the depletion of erythrocytes and reticulocytes from the latter, it is assumed that these differences are related to the abundant mrna expression of members of the hemoglobin gene family  <cit> . previous studies have shown that depletion of globin mrna resulted in an increased number of detected probes, a decrease of variability and improved detection sensitivity for mrnas from non-reticulocyte cell types  <cit>  but we did not specifically test this option in the present study.

we next calculated the mean expression values across individuals and visits for each overlapping detected probe between four pairs of cell and rna isolation methods with  corresponding or closely related cell types to visualize inter-individual variability: i) pax and pbmcs, ii) lcls and b-cell cd <dig>  iii) lcls and b-cell cd <dig>  and iv) b-cell cd <dig> and b-cell cd <dig> . the pax expression levels are decreased but more variable than the pbmc expression levels . the lcl expression levels are of similar magnitude as the b-cell cd <dig> or b-cell cd <dig> expression levels  but lower than the correlation between b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig> .

variation in expression profiles between different isolation methods and visits can originate from both biological and technical sources. inter-individual biological variation can arise from variation such as genetic variation, cellular composition, ethnicity, sex, genotype-environment interactions or physiological variation such as time of the day at which a sample was taken, diet and stress. the latter would also contribute to variability between multiple visits  <cit> . technical variation can be caused by the different steps of the experiment such as sample preparation, isolation of cellular components, labelling, hybridisation and time to analysis  <cit> .

we found high correlations between visits for each method  but lower correlations between different methods  suggesting that the cell or rna isolation method has a larger impact on the gene expression profile than the variability between visits. the decreased correlations between lcls and b-cell cd <dig> or b-cell cd <dig> might have resulted from the controlled in vitro conditions of the lcls or the b-cell purifications.

methods that involve much post-processing provide less variability but these manipulations might alter gene expression patterns from those in vivo. the intrinsic and extrinsic factors play a key role in choosing the most preferable study design. in genetic studies, homogeneous cell populations - in which extrinsic factors are minimized compared to ex vivo samples - are more useful whereas for biomarker detection whole blood samples capturing in vivo conditions more accurately could be more informative.

gene expression profiles are dependent on cell and rna isolation method
to explore and visualise sources of variation in this dataset, we clustered a subset of  <dig>  probes that were expressed in all  <dig> samples with a detection score > <dig>  using principal components analysis  and hierarchical clustering methods. figure  <dig> shows that pca with three components separated the samples according to the five methods. the first two components in the pca separated the pbmcs, b-cell cd <dig>  b-cell cd <dig> from pax and lcls explaining 70% of the variance. the third component discriminated the pbmcs from b-cell cd <dig> and b-cell cd <dig> explaining  <dig> % of the variance. notably, b-cell cd <dig> and b-cell cd <dig> samples were clustered together.

we computed partial least squares discriminant analysis  models for each isolation method to examine sets of genes whose transcripts are responsible for separating the methods. for each model, we extracted the variable weights of the expression probes, ranked these variable weights and selected the 5% highest and 5% lowest ranked expression probes. table  <dig> shows genes that were strongly up- or down-regulated in the pls-da models.

these ten subsets of expression probes were then analyzed for statistical enrichment of gene ontology  terms for biological processes using all  <dig>  expressed probes as a background list. the up-regulated probes in lcls and the down-regulated probes of the b-cell cd <dig> samples  revealed an enrichment of alcohol metabolic process  p =  <dig> *10- <dig> and fdr p =  <dig> ) .

the go terms "response to wounding"  and "signal transduction"  were enriched in the down-regulated probes of the lcls  and the up-regulated probes of the pax  and pbmcs . hierarchical clustering of the variable weights of the  <dig>  down- and up-regulated expression probes of all five methods resulted in clustering of transcripts according to these go terms . to examine the concordance of gene expression measurements across methods, we extracted  <dig>  expression probes that showed variable weights between - <dig>  and  <dig>  for all methods. go analysis showed an enrichment of "secretion by cell"  and "antigen presentation and processing" .

gene expression differences between isolation methods are associated with cellular composition and b-cell manipulation
because pls-da analysis only gives an overview of variation for probes across all methods, we refined our go analysis by making pair-wise comparisons of closely related isolation methods focusing on i) uniquely detected probes and ii) overlapping detected probes that were significantly differentially expressed between two methods . in this analysis, we ranked the probes on significance and then selected 5% of the most significant probes that showed an at least three-fold change.

in the pax-pbmc comparison,  <dig> probes were detected in pax but not in the pbmcs and  <dig>  probes vice versa. for the uniquely detected probes in the pbmcs and pax, none of the go terms was significantly enriched after fdr correction. we found  <dig>  probes differentially expressed between pax and the pbmcs . these probes showed an enrichment of "gas transport"  containing genes ca <dig>  hbd and hbq <dig> in pax . the go term "macromolecule biosynthetic process"  was most significantly enriched in the pbmcs containing  <dig> genes  encoding proteins such as ribosomal proteins, translation initiation and elongation factors.

these findings suggest that the gene expression differences between the pbmcs and pax are caused by the differences in cellular composition; gas transport is specific for erythrocytes and translation and transcription are physiological responses more important in lymphocytes and monocytes than in granulocytes  <cit> . to explore whether enrichment is derived from the most abundant cell types in the sample, we clustered the differentially expressed transcripts in six groups and correlated the transcripts in each group to the cell counts in whole blood . all three groups up-regulated in the pbmcs showed significant positive correlations with monocyte counts  and platelets . only one of these groups was correlated with lymphocytes  whereas the two other groups of up-regulated genes were significantly positively correlated with neutrophil count . three groups of probes were up-regulated in pax containing probes targeting "hemoglobin" and "signal transduction" genes and the latter was significantly positively correlated with erythrocyte count  and mean cell volume  .

to prevent the difficulties of cell type mixtures, b-cell specific methods have been developed. to investigate to which extent b-cell specific methods differ from each other, we compared gene expression measurements of lcls with b-cell cd <dig> and b-cell cd <dig>  for the b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  probes were uniquely expressed compared with the lcls . in both b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig> the go term  "response to wounding"  was most significantly enriched. this category contained b-cell specific genes encoding complement pathway components , interleukins , chemokine receptors , immunoglobulin receptors  and members of the toll-like receptor family  .

in the lcls,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes were uniquely expressed as compared to b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig> . these probes showed an enrichment of the go term "cell cycle phase"  and included genes involved in mitosis . between the b-cell cd <dig> or b-cell cd <dig> and lcl samples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes were differentially expressed. in both b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig> samples, glycolysis go terms were enriched whereas cell cycle go terms were only enriched in b-cell cd <dig> . the go analysis suggested an increased rate of glycolysis and cell cycle in lcls as compared with b-cells. b lymphocytes found in the peripheral circulation are in a non-proliferative state and require stimulation with an antigen to enter the cell cycle. hollyoake et al. showed that infection with ebv causes the infected cells to activate the cell-division cycle  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression profiling of blood is a valuable tool for diagnostics in a wide range of diseases, particularly those involving the immune system and cancer. before peripheral blood or cell lines can be used in large cohorts to characterise differences between a patient group and healthy controls, it is important to understand the underlying biological and technical factors that contribute to the gene expression measurements. our results give insight into the variability and characterisation of biological differences between post venipuncture methods including lcls, purified b-cells , pbmcs and whole blood samples for global gene expression profiling. the number of expressed genes as well the gene expression measurements differ significantly between different isolation techniques. although the paxgene system is suitable for large-scale gene expression profiling, particularly in large epidemiological and biobank studies where immediate sample processing is not always practical, the pax samples showed a decrease in the number of expressed genes and lower gene expression values with higher variability compared to the pbmcs. although whole blood samples contain more cell populations with different relative proportions than pbmcs, expression profile differences between the two isolation methods are also likely to be  caused by the abundance of globin mrna. additional steps in the pax protocol involving globin reduction could improve sensitivity and variability of this sample type relative to other isolation methods  <cit> .

the up-regulated probes in pbmcs showed significant positive correlations with the number of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils, whereas the down-regulated probes were correlated with the number erythrocytes and mean cell volume. our comparison between b-cell subsets and lcls showed that the correlations between the expression levels of detected probes were much lower compared to the two b-cell isolation methods. more specifically, enrichment of inflammatory response genes in the b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig> may represent the lack of external stimuli of the in vitro controlled conditions in lcls or the manipulation of the b-cell cd <dig> and cd <dig>  conversely, the enrichment of glycolysis and cell cycle genes in lcls might appear as adaptation to the in vitro cell transformation of b-cells to lcls and might reflect indefinite lcl propagation.

in this study, we used two positive selection approaches -using incubation of pbmcs with anti-cd <dig> or anti-cd20- to purify b-cell populations. a potential limitation of these approaches is the activation of cell surface receptors that might alter gene expression. further studies of gene expression profiles of other more recently developed b-cell selection methods using a negative selection approach should further improve our understanding of gene expression variability in blood  <cit> .

some of these cell and rna isolation methods are widely used in large-scale clinical studies; indeed, paxgene is a likely to be a favoured method for general whole blood expression profiling in samples stored in large biobanking facilities. it is, however, crucial to consider what effect the choice of a specific rna isolation procedure has on the ability to detect certain gene expression profiles and their likely relation to the disease of interest.
