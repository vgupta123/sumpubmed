BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor protein, p <dig>  is a transcription factor that regulates the activity of hundreds of genes involved in cell growth and death  <cit> . over 50% of human cancer cells contain mutations in p <dig>  because of which it has become a key target in cancer research  <cit> . a wide variety of stress conditions result in the accumulation and activation of p <dig> - among others: dna damage, hypoxia, heat shock, nutrient deprivation and oncogene activation. despite the fact that all these inputs are integrated into a single node, p <dig>  the expression pattern of downstream genes  appears to be specific to each stress. for example, hypoxia invariably leads to apoptosis  <cit> , whereas ribonucleotide depletion leads to reversible cell cycle arrest  <cit> , and uv irradiation can result in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the intensity of the damage  <cit> .

how does the regulatory network around p <dig> retain this exibility even though all inputs converge at a single node? we argue in this paper that the particular design of the p53-mdm <dig> feedback loop at the core of this network could be the source of this flexibility. p <dig> is regulated by other proteins at two levels: its stability , and its activity as a transcription factor . we focus on mdm <dig> because  mdm <dig> null mutants are lethal in early development in mice  <cit> , and  mdm <dig> directly regulates both activity and stability of p <dig>  mdm <dig> is an e <dig> ligase that binds to p <dig>  mono-ubiquitination of p <dig> by mdm <dig> inhibits its transcriptional activity, while poly-ubiquitination triggers its degradation  <cit> . in turn, the mdm <dig> gene is activated by p <dig>  thus forming a negative feedback loop  <cit> . we use a mathematical model of the p53-mdm <dig> feedback loop to demonstrate how multiple inputs can be integrated with sufficient discrimination in such a feedback loop to allow diverse, yet specific, output behaviour. using the model, we can predict which input stresses will produce the stronger p <dig> response, as well as the effect of single nucelotide polymorphisms  on the p <dig> response.

methods
a model of the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback loop
our model focuses on the following four concentrations: nuclear-p <dig>  p; mdm <dig>  m; mdm <dig> mrna, mm; and the p53-mdm <dig> complex, c. the temporal dynamics of these components of the model are specified by four differential equations:            

the model is provided in sbml format as additional file  <dig> and in the biomodels database: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main, model number  <dig> 

the numbers show the default value of each parameter, and correspond to the default resting state marked by the white dot in figure  <dig>  the rightmost column shows which stresses increase  or decrease  the value of a parameter. details of the choice of parameter values are given in additional file  <dig> 

most previous models have used an explicit time delay to model transcription and translation . in these models, the time delays are essential for producing oscillatory behaviour of p <dig> concentration. mathematically, the use of explicit time delays converts the equations into delay differential equations which have effectively infinite dimensions and are well known to often exhibit oscillatory behaviour. in contrast our model has no explicit time delay. thus, the cause of oscillations in our model is completely different; they occur due to the nonlinearities introduced by complex formation between p <dig> and mdm <dig>  other models  <cit>  have avoided explicit time delays but used multiple feedback loops, whereas our model uses a single negative feedback loop.  <cit>  has explored a range of different models to reproduce the behaviour under gamma irradiation. of these, one model, iv, is closest to our model in that it uses a nonlinear degradation of p <dig> instead of explicit time delays to produce oscillations. however, the molecular mechanism behind this nonlinearity was not discussed. our model shows that the complex formation between p <dig> and mdm <dig> is sufficient for generating nonlinearities that lead to oscillations. finally, the main purpose of this paper, to investigate response specificity to different stresses has not, to our knowledge, been studied in any previous model.

RESULTS
p <dig> dynamics in the presence and absence of stress
this model system of a negative feedback loop shows plenty of variety in output behaviour. depending on the values of parameters, the system is capable of steady state solutions with any combination of high or low p <dig> and mdm <dig>  as well as oscillations with high or low average p <dig>  figure 2a shows four examples: a steady state response and oscillations with differing amplitudes and periods. the oscillations are typically spiky, but smooth oscillations can also be generated.

ideally, we would like to correlate each of these output states of the pathway to specific physiological responses like cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. clearly, the level of p <dig> is an important determinant of the response  <cit> , and the presence or absence of oscillations is also likely to be related to the physiological behaviour  <cit> . when there are oscillations, some downstream genes may respond to the peak p <dig> level, while others may sense the average level. this depends on the association and dissociation rates of p <dig> to the relevant operators . further, in some cases the response may depend on the activity of p <dig> as well as its level  <cit> . in sum, not enough information exists to make a precise link between the molecular state and the physiological response. however, it is reasonable to expect that large increases in p <dig> levels would correlate with a higher incidence of apoptosis, whereas low or moderate increases would correlate with less drastic responses such as cell cycle arrest. therefore, we have elected to discuss the response in terms of the p <dig> level. in the figures below we have shown the peak p <dig> level. similar figures with average p <dig> level, and the ratio between free and bound p <dig> are shown in figures s <dig> and s <dig> of additional file  <dig> 

in the absence of stress, p <dig> levels are typically maintained quite low. for this, a sufficient mdm <dig> level is required to keep the half-life of p <dig> short. thus, in a typical "resting" state there is a fairly high turnover of p <dig>  the area shaded in green and blue in figures 2b-d shows parameter combinations which satisfy these conditions - a low level of p <dig> and no oscillations. the white dot, the default resting state of the cell, before it is subjected to any stress, was chosen to lie within this blue-green region of parameter space . of course, the precise levels of concentration, and turnover rates, in the resting state can vary from cell to cell, both because of variability in levels of various proteins, as well as the presence of mutations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms. we will return to this point later in the paper.

specific response to four stresses
the system can be triggered by numerous stresses. we model different stresses as affecting different parameter combinations, as shown in table  <dig>  figure 2a shows the diversity in response to different stresses, starting from the same resting state. from figures 2b-d it already becomes apparent that the level of p <dig> is more sensitive to changes in δ and kt than to the p53-mdm <dig> dissociation constant kd = kb/kf. most stresses, however, affect more than one parameter.

a particularly simple, though "artificial", stress is the introduction of nutlin. nutlin reduces the binding of mdm <dig> to p <dig>  while leaving its other properties unchanged. nutlin treatment can trigger cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis  <cit> . this is consistent with our model's prediction that increasing kd  alone causes a very modest increase in p <dig> levels .

a more common real-world stress is dna damage, which can trigger processes that result in  increased auto-ubiquitination of mdm <dig>   decreased ubiquitination of p <dig> by mdm <dig> and  weaker binding of p53-mdm <dig>  <cit> , corresponding in our model to increasing γ, decreasing δ, and increasing kd. single-cell experiments have found that irradiation of various types triggers oscillations in p <dig> levels with a period of 5- <dig> hours. the parameter changes used to mimic dna damage stress were chosen such that the response matches the observations of ref.  <cit>  which found that, in response to ionizing radiation, the first p <dig> peak occured at around  <dig> min, the second at  <dig> hours and the third between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. the damping of the amplitude also matches the observations which found the second peak to be around half as high as the first, and the third to be around  <dig>  times lower than the first  <cit> . a similar response is seen when gamma radiation is used to induce dna damage  <cit> . when we increase kd and γ, while lowering δ, corresponding to the molecular processes described above, our model produces an oscillatory solution in accordance with the experimental observations .

hypoxia is another stress that increases p <dig> levels. it is known that under hypoxic conditions, even though p <dig> accumulates, it does not possess its transactivation property  <cit> , i.e., kt is decreased. this means that mdm <dig> is down-regulated. furthermore, hypoxia induces hif which binds to p <dig> and prevents degradation  <cit> , which we mimic by decreasing δ. hypoxia does not lead to cell-cycle arrest, suggesting that it typically results in much higher levels of p <dig>  consistent with this picture, our model yields a stronger response  when we apply a hypoxic stress when compared to other stresses with similar fold-changes in parameter values .

deregulated oncogenes are another signal that can trigger the p <dig> pathway. they lead to increased transcription of arf, which binds to mdm <dig> and inhibits its e <dig> ligase activity  <cit> . this corresponds to decreasing δ, the mdm2-dependent degradation of p <dig>  the response to this, in our model, is oscillations in p <dig> but weaker than the response to dna damage or hypoxia .

predicting the relative strength of the response to different stresses
the average free p <dig> level is in general much more sensitive to changes in γ, δ, kt and ι than to changes in α and kd. the sensitivity with respect to variation of γ appears to be very little for values in the range of 1-to 2-fold the default value. this coincides with the onset of oscillations. in contrast, the peak p <dig> level retains its sensitivity . that is, while the amplitude of oscillations increases significantly the average does not, a feature that arises due to the spikyness of the oscillations. the physiological significance of this is unclear.

overall, it is clear that stresses that affect only α or kd, such as nutlin, will have the least impact on average p <dig> level. for other stresses, the relative impact depends on how many of the sensitive parameters they affect. thus, dna damage and hypoxia, which each affect two sensitive parameters, result in a relatively stronger response than oncogene deregulation, which only affects one parameter.

the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms
our model can also be used to examine the behaviour of certain mutant cell lines. for instance, the g allele of the mdm <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  <dig>  results in an increased expression of mdm <dig> compared to the t allele  <cit> . this corresponds to changing the initial resting state from the one in figure 2c to one with increased kt , as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the figure shows that, in our model, for a given intensity of stress, the response of a cell with the g allele is weaker. this suggests that populations with a higher frequency of the g allele, such as caucasians  should exhibit a lower p <dig> level in response to stress. assuming that p <dig> level correlates with apoptosis, this would suggest a lower incidence of apoptosis, and a higher frequency of tumour formation. this is indeed observed when comparing apoptosis frequency in lymphocyte cell lines from caucasian and african american donors  <cit> .

variability in the p <dig> response
single-cell measurements of p <dig> oscillations in response to various types of irradiation exhibit a fair amount of variability in the response across different cells  <cit> . the deterministic simulations we have done cannot address this issue, so stochastic simulations are required. however, the numbers of p <dig> and mdm <dig> molecules are typically very large: measured levels of p <dig> range from  <dig> - <dig>  molecules in different cell lines  <cit> , and the resting level of p <dig> in our model, ≈  <dig> nm, corresponds to  <dig>  molecules per cell . such high numbers mean that the noise due to stochasticity in production and degradation of molecules is very small. thus, the result of stochastic simulations of our model using the standard gillespie algorithm  <cit>  are indistinguishable from the deterministic simulations. it is possible that there are other sources that result in a higher noise in cells. if we increase the noise in our gillespie simulations in an ad-hoc manner  then we observe that the first peak position is quite robust to noise, the second peak position varies a little more, while the third peak position varies significantly . this is exactly what has been observed in single-cell experiments of the p <dig> response to ionizing radiation  <cit> . on the basis of these stochastic simulations we hypothesize that:

 <dig>  the variability in p <dig> response observed in  <cit>  must originate from sources other than stochasticity in the production and degradation of molecules, because the numbers of involved molecules are rather large.

 <dig>  increasing amounts of noise are likely to introduce more variability in the position of later p <dig> peaks than in earlier peaks, as observed.

however, a proper analysis of these hypotheses requires a better knowledge of which sources of noise underly the variability observed, so that they can be modelled accurately.

CONCLUSIONS
predictions from the model
the sensitivity analysis in figure  <dig> shows which parameters most affect the p <dig> level in our model. combining this information with a knowledge of which parameters are affected by different stresses provides predictions about which stresses will affect the p <dig> level the most. one specific prediction is that around the onset of oscillations, changes in γ result in large changes in peak p <dig> levels but hardly any change in average p <dig> levels.

the analysis also leads to a prediction of reduced p53-dependent apoptosis in populations which have an increased frequency of the g allele of the mdm <dig> snp <dig> - a prediction that is confirmed by observations. in addition, if the increase in kt due to the snp is sufficient, then although p <dig> will be upregulated in response to stress, oscillations will not occur . this effect has also been observed experimentally  <cit> . the same analysis method can be used to predict the effect of other snps as soon as one knows which parameters  they affect.

finally, we note that the temporal dynamics of the p <dig> response to different stresses are also predictions of the model that can be tested experimentally. to our knowledge, single cell experiments examining the p <dig> dynamics in response to hypoxia or oncogene deregulation have not been done. our model predicts that oscillations should be observed in both cases, which tend to have longer time periods than in response to dna damage and with a particularly distinct time delay  between the first and second peaks.

extending the model
our model could eventually be extended to cover other stresses that trigger a p <dig> response as more data becomes available. nitric oxide  is a free radical produced in inflamed tissue which can trigger the p <dig> pathway by phosphorylating p <dig> and thereby inhibiting its mdm2-mediated degradation  <cit> . another example is ribonucleotide depletion: cells suffering this undergo a reversible p53-dependent cell cycle arrest  <cit> . how this happens has not been fully worked out, but a hypothesis exists: the depletion could cause a redistribution of p <dig> from cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can be transcriptionally active  <cit> . finally, heat shock can also trigger p <dig> but the picture is rather complex and indecisive, involving various chaperones and heat shock proteins  <cit> . other directions to extend the model are of course to include other feedback loops and essential players in p <dig> regulation, such as wip <dig>  <cit>  and mdmx  <cit> , and to model the connection between p <dig> levels and physiological behaviour more accurately as has been done for cell cycle arrest in ref.  <cit> .

overall, we have shown that this kind of negative feedback loop, consisting of a relatively slow transciptional activation on one leg of the loop, and an inhibition based on fast complex formation on the other, can be designed to respond specifically to a number of different input triggers. this kind of negative feedback loop also occurs in another important signalling pathway that is triggered by hundreds of input signals, namely nf-κb signalling in the immune system  <cit> . nf-κb is a transcription factor that controls hundreds of downstream genes. it activates production of iκbα, which binds to and inhibits the action of nf-κb  <cit> . the resultant negative feedback loop exhibits spiky oscillations  <cit>  similar to the kind we observe in the model presented here. thus, our results might also have relevance beyond p <dig>
