BACKGROUND
the recent introduction of next generation sequencing platforms such as the applied biosystems solid sequencer, the roche  sequencer and the illumina genome analyzer, has seen an exponential increase in genome sequencing efforts for a wide range of organisms. over the last  <dig> years, a variety of genomes such as cow  <cit> , papaya  <cit> , cucumber  <cit>  and the filamentous fungus grosmannia clavigera  <cit> , have been sequenced using these platforms. from the short overlapping sequence fragments obtained, it is possible to generate draft genome sequences using various algorithms developed for de novo sequence assembly  <cit> . despite improvements in the software used in the assembly of small dna sequences, it is very difficult to build a fully assembled genome using short read sequence data alone. the number of contiguous sequences in the final assembly can vary from tens, to several thousands depending on the accuracy of the primary sequence data, the depth of sequence coverage, the length and number of sequence repeats and the genome size of the organism studied.

various methods have been developed to position sequence scaffolds on physical or genetic maps to assist in the assembly process. positional information for assemblies can, for instance, be derived from comparison with genomic sequences of related organisms. for relatively small genomes with limited numbers of sequence repeats, gaps between genomic sequences can be bridged by polymerase chain reaction or cloning strategies.

however, these methods remain expensive and time consuming, and are largely impractical for organisms with relatively large genomes. until now, for organisms where no close relatives had been sequenced, the positioning of sequence contigs relative to one another has required their anchoring to saturated linkage maps which has largely depended upon the availability of abundant mapped genetic markers such as simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers.

snps are the most common form of genetic variation between individuals, making them very attractive for anchoring genome sequence contigs to linkage maps. methods for identifying and genotyping these snps have developed rapidly in the last few years and, as a result, a variety of snp genotyping protocols have become available  <cit> . however, the ability to build high-density snp assays relies entirely on the current availability of large numbers of snps with known genomic coordinates and known allele frequencies. for the majority of species, the development of high-density snp assays remains a challenge because draft genome sequences, when available, are generated from the dna of a single inbred individual and, thus, do not readily permit the identification of large numbers of snps. moreover, the cost of complete genome re-sequencing for snp discovery remains prohibitive for species with large genomes.

a strategy known as 'selective' or 'bin' mapping has been developed, which permits rapid mapping of large numbers of genetic markers to a mapping framework with a low degree of precision, by using only a subset of highly informative progeny individuals  <cit> . thus, for a given marker, the joint  genotype of the selected subset of individuals at a locus identifies a unique mapping bin on the genetic map of the organism.

we describe a method utilizing next generation sequencing to score snps and anchor assemblies to a genetic map by exploiting the bin mapping strategy, hereafter referred to as the snp by sequencing bin mapping strategy .

our approach is based on deep sequencing of genomic libraries from selected progeny individuals. the method was tested on a haploid organism  and then validated using the diploid plant species fragaria vesca . the genome of v. inaequalis, a hemi-biotrophic fungus which is a pathogen of apples   <cit>  has been estimated to be as large as  <dig> mbp  <cit> . however, a draft de novo shotgun genome sequence assembled from short single-end and paired-end sequence data, despite having a depth of coverage of approximately 100×, covers just under  <dig> mbp of unique sequence . the f. vesca genome size, on the other hand, has been estimated to be in the region of  <dig> mb  <cit> . sequencing of the f. vesca genome has recently been carried out using a range of sequencing platforms  <cit> . de novo assembly yielded a total of over  <dig> scaffolds, of which  <dig> cover  <dig>  mb.

using a bin mapping set derived from a genetic linkage map, whole genome re-sequencing was performed on individuals issued from a v. inaequalis population. the validation of our strategy was then performed by re-sequencing individuals derived from a cross between two closely related diploid strawberry species f. vesca and f. nubicola  <cit> . the relative large size of the fragaria genome meant that re-sequencing was performed on reduced-complexity libraries in order to maximize the genome coverage at particular locations. the overall objective was to maximize the number of snps detected by whole-genome, or partial re-sequencing of selected progeny individuals, and to use the snps identified to anchor the draft genome assembly to an existing genetic map using a bin mapping strategy.

RESULTS
test of the ssbm strategy on v. inaequalis
genome sequencing and assembly
sequencing of the v. inaequalis genome has recently been performed  using illumina sequencing technology. de novo assembly of a mixture of single- and paired-end sequences was performed using velvet  <cit>  and yielded a total of  <dig> sequence contigs larger than  <dig> bp. these sequence contigs totalled  <dig> , <dig> bp with a median size of  <dig> bp, an average size of  <dig>  bp and a largest sequence assembly size of  <dig>  bp. more than 85% of the genome sequence contigs were longer than  <dig> kb .

construction of the bin mapping set
using the selective mapping strategy, eight haploid progeny isolates were selected from a population derived from a cross between isolates c <dig>  and 01/ <dig> . the framework linkage map developed for this progeny  <cit> , which covers a total of  <dig> cm, was divided into  <dig> bins using eight individuals following the method described previously  <cit> . the average bin length was  <dig>  cm and the longest bin length identified was  <dig>  cm. as there were a limited number of individuals selected and because of the haploid nature of the organism under investigation,  <dig> non-contiguous pairs of bins mapping at different locations in the genome were identified as having identical joint genotypes.

library sequencing
the small genome size of v. inaequalis, coupled with recent improvements in read length and throughput on the illumina genome analyzer platform, have made it possible to use whole genome re-sequencing for snp discovery and validation. thus, the genomes of all eight individuals in the bin mapping set were sequenced to a depth in the range of 2× and  <dig> ×. the total amount of sequence data obtained for each of the eight libraries varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> mb . of the  <dig> bases generated for each sequence, only the first  <dig> bases were used for sequence alignment and snp detection. as shown by the illumina solexa output files, the raw quality of the bases sequenced following base number  <dig> started decreasing significantly. therefore, to avoid the identification of false snps and the identification of false joint genotypes, the last  <dig> bases of each sequence were not taken into consideration.

the 'number of sequences' represents the total number of short sequence fragments sequenced for each individual.

sequence alignment and joint genotype detection
alignment of the  <dig> bp sequences to the reference v. inaequalis genome was performed with maq  <cit>  using the stringent conditions described in the methods section. under these conditions, putative snps were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> unique sequences . high quality snps were identified, on average, every  <dig> bp.

a total of  <dig> contigs were identified with at least three joint genotypes each and represented  <dig> , <dig> bp, or 98%, of the assembled genome sequence used in the analysis. the number of identical joint genotypes identified per sequence assembly varied from three to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> and a median of seven.

as the v. inaequalis genome sequence used as the reference was different from the two parental strains used in the construction of the bin mapping progeny, the validation of the joint genotype for each sequence assembly was confirmed visually in to avoid the detection of false positive snps and priority was given to sequence contigs with a length in excess of  <dig> kb.

contig anchoring and validation
of the  <dig> sequence contigs which were larger than  <dig> kb,  <dig>  were identified as having an unambiguous joint genotype and, thus, could potentially be anchored onto the genetic map. in addition to these, the joint genotype of an extra  <dig> sequence contigs with a sequence length shorter than  <dig> kb was also scored. this brought the total number of sequence contigs that could be scored for snps in the bin mapping progeny to  <dig>  covering  <dig> , <dig> bp  of the draft genome assembly.

the joint genotype of each of the  <dig> sequence contigs was then compared to the joint genotype of the pre-determined bins. from this analysis,  <dig> sequence contigs  were anchored to pre-determined bins, with the remaining  <dig>  falling into bins that had not previously been identified  because of the restricted marker density on the original linkage map, which was estimated to cover around 70% of the v. inaequalis genome. these new bins were analysed and their position on the linkage map was determined by comparing their joint genotypes with the joint genotypes of neighbouring bins, in between which more than one recombination event was observed. and with the joint genotypes of bins located at the extremities of the linkage groups. this comparison allowed the positioning of  <dig> new bins  on the linkage map. we also established that eight additional new bins  could be positioned at more than one location in the bin map. details of the analysis are presented in table  <dig>  finally, no potential location could be identified for  <dig> new bins  which, presumably, lie outside the framework of the current linkage map.

the sequence contigs anchored comprise the contigs for which the joint genotype matches the joint genotype of the pre-determined bins and the contigs for which the bins could be placed into the map. the number of sequence contigs scored and anchored is followed by their respective percentage relative to the total number of sequence contigs indicated in the second column.

in order to validate our strategy, the map location of  <dig> ssr markers identified from the v. inaequalis genome sequence  was compared to the bin location of the sequence contigs from which they had been developed. of these  <dig> sequence contigs,  <dig> were not bin mapped by snp-seq because the number of joint genotype identified in the sequence did not reach the threshold of three required for validation. of the remaining  <dig> sequence contigs,  <dig> were located in the bin in which their respective ssr had been mapped and four were misplaced. primer sequences for the  <dig> ssr sequences are given in additional file  <dig>  a detailed analysis of the output of the maq program revealed that these sequence contigs had been misplaced, mainly because of the low coverage observed for library  <dig> .

validation of the ssbm strategy on f. vesca
bin mapping set construction
six f <dig> individuals were selected from a mapping population derived from a cross between f. vesca and f. nubicola. the linkage map constructed from this cross covered a total distance of  <dig> cm and was divided into  <dig> bins.

library sequencing
dna fragments of  <dig> bp were generated by the illumina genome analyzer ii, of which  <dig> bp were used for sequence alignment. considering that the alu i fragments isolated represented approximately 10% of the genome, each library thus presented a total coverage of  <dig> × to 48× at these particular genomic locations. the final size of data used for the analysis varied from  <dig> to  <dig> mb .

sequence alignment, scaffolds anchoring and validation
alignment of the  <dig> bp sequences to the f. vesca genome was performed using the same stringent conditions used previously. using sequences derived from the male grand-parental library , snps were identified in the majority of the  <dig> scaffolds and one snp was detected in approximately 25% of the alu i fragments. using our approach,  <dig> of the  <dig> scaffolds of over  <dig> kb in length of the f. vesca genome sequence were anchored to the genetic map . in addition,  <dig> scaffolds ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp were also anchored. in total,  <dig> % of the fragaria genome was anchored to the genetic map using the ssbm strategy.

the number of contigs anchored is followed by their respective percentage  relative to the total number of contig indicated in the first column. the last column indicates the total size in kb anchored to the map.

validation of the contig location was performed by mapping ssr and snp markers developed from fragaria sequences. of the  <dig> markers developed,  <dig>  were mapped to genomic regions corresponding to the bin location where their respective scaffolds had been anchored. the majority of the remaining markers were mapped to genomic regions corresponding to adjacent bin locations.

in a few cases, snp identification at regular intervals along fragaria sequence assemblies allowed us to identify clear changes in joint genotypes within the same assembly. for six of these assemblies, this change in joint genotype did not correspond to a passage from one bin to the next but to a completely different bin located in another part of the genome. detailed analysis of the assemblies using the snp data allowed us to pinpoint the location in which the miss-assembly had occurred, thus improving the final quality of the assembled sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
our strategy has shown that it is now possible to anchor genome sequence contigs to a reference linkage map without having to first develop and locate large numbers of sequence characterized genetic markers or undertake the sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome  ends. this method is ideally suited to organisms for which genetic resources are poorly developed. using a foundation genetic map, we have developed the possibility of anchoring and ordering genome sequence contigs rapidly, easily and cost-effectively, without the need of prior extensive genetic knowledge of the organism studied.

the anchoring of sequence contigs to bins provides, in most instances, an approximate estimate of the location of a sequence in a particular linkage group but does not allow the relative positioning of sequence contigs within each bin. thus, the accuracy of the location of each sequence assembly within the map depends entirely on the initial selection of the individuals to be sequenced and on the size of the sequence contigs to be anchored. sequencing more individuals would eventually eliminate bins with similar joint genotypes and permit the identification of additional bins, therefore leading to an increased precision of the bin mapping. however, the location of large numbers of sequence contigs within an existing genetic map can serve as a robust framework for the anchoring of the genome sequence of an organism without the requirement of a high density physical mapping or well-saturated genetic mapping platform. once scaffolds have been located to mapping bins, the precise positioning of scaffolds and their orientation relative to the linkage map can be performed in a targeted fashion. where more precise positioning and orientation is required for a given genome region, individual snps can be scored in the entire mapping population from which the bin set was derived and scaffolds can be located relative to the genetic markers used to generate the foundation linkage map.

for larger haploid or diploid genomes, the snp mapping by sequencing strategy can also be applied, as it is possible to sequence a large number of snps across all selected progenies by targeting specific regions of the genome. as demonstrated by our study performed on the diploid genome of f. vesca, this can be achieved by constructing libraries with a reduced complexity using restriction enzymes cutting at frequent intervals throughout the genome.

furthermore, the ssbm strategy can also contribute to improve the quality of the genome assembly by identifying misassembled fragments through the identification of snps at regular intervals. thus, our strategy provides a way to validate the assembly of large sequence fragments.

as a result of the very high throughput generated by the illumina genome analyzer ii, libraries could in the future be indexed and run together within a single lane of a flowcell, thus reducing the initial sequencing costs. conversely, provided that the organism studied has a relatively small genome size, whole sequencing of a subset of individuals derived from a mapping population, instead of a single inbred individual, could provide sufficient data for the de novo assembly of the organism's genome and for the positioning of sequence contigs derived from the sequence assembly into a genetic map.

given the flexibility and scalability of this approach, together with its demonstrated power to detect large numbers of high quality snps, we expect this method to significantly reduce the time and costs associated with de novo sequencing and alignment of sequence contigs to a linkage map. in addition, it should be possible to undertake this process without the use of an existing linkage map. for relatively small genomes, the sequencing of a larger set of individuals could provide enough data to perform de novo sequence assembly, snp identification and relative sequence assembly positioning. the use of long mate pair sequencing will result in the generation of much larger de novo assemblies which will, in turn, allow the use of reduced complexity sequencing to provide the snp-seq bin set data needed for the application of the ssbm strategy to larger genomes. this opens the way for the generation of low cost draft genome sequencing for a wide range of minor crops and pathogens for which funding is usually limited.
