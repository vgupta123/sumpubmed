BACKGROUND
cetaceans, commonly known as whales, dolphins and porpoises, have a mysterious history of transition from land to water. numerous phylogenetic studies based on morphological as well as molecular characteristics have suggested that cetacea is an independent clade nested within the mammalian order artiodactyla . molecular studies have dated modern cetaceans  to have originated about  <dig> mya   <cit> . subsequently, cetaceans developed a series of adaptations to fully aquatic environments   <cit> . however, the genetic basis for the origin and adaptation of this group of species is far from clear. several studies have shown that many loci in cetaceans have gone through adaptive evolution, suggesting that some cetacean organs evolved adaptively while others degenerated. for example, the membrane motor protein gene prestin, which is associated with high-frequency hearing in vertebrates, was shown to undergo positive selection in echolocating dolphins  <cit> , whereas the number of olfactory receptor family pseudogenes is significantly higher in cetaceans than in other mammals  <cit> .

five basic taste modalities, sour, sweet, bitter, salt, and umami, can be distinguished by humans and are fundamental for physical and ecological adaptations in mammals  <cit> . among them, umami and sweet tastes are attractive and beneficial to animals’ ingestion of protein-rich and nutritious food. salt at low concentrations is an attractive taste and is associated with na+ reabsorption  <cit> . bitter tastes can cause taste aversion, thus protecting mammals from ingesting toxic substances  <cit> . sour tastes are unpleasant and can prevent the ingestion of unripe and decayed food resources  <cit> . the receptor genes of each taste modality have been identified in mammals. in particular, umami/sweet tastants are perceived by tas1rs  belonging to the g-protein coupled receptor c subtype family. tas1r <dig> or tas1r <dig> are co-expressed with tas1r <dig> to perceive umami or sweet tastants, respectively  <cit> . bitter substances are perceived by tas2rs   <cit> . chandrashekar et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that a mouse t2r  responded to the bitter tastant cycloheximide, and a human receptor ht2r- <dig> and a mouse receptor mt2r- <dig> responded to denatonium and 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil. jiang et al.   <cit>  identified only  <dig> tas2rs genes in dolphin genome and all these genes were proved to be pseudogenes. thus, we used these  <dig> tas2rs from cow and dog reference genomes to search the yangtze river dolphin  genome for the raw members of these genes and further compared them to dolphin assembly. eventually, we identified  <dig> tas2rs excluding tas2r <dig> and tas2r62b in baiji genome, so we used the  <dig> tas2rs in jiang et al.  <dig> to conduct our experiment. sour and salt taste receptors are ion channels. to date, several candidate sour taste receptors have been reported, including acid sensing ion channels   <cit> , hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated potassium channels   <cit> , potassium channels  <cit> , and polycystic kidney disease 1 l <dig> and 2 l <dig> heteromers   <cit> . here we chose pkd2l <dig> to investigate whether cetaceans retained the sour taste modality, because mice lacking the pkd2l <dig> gene have reduced sour taste ability and some people who are sour-ageusic also showed loss of the pkd2l <dig> gene  <cit> . opposite taste responses are observed for saline solutions of different concentrations; low concentrations are perceived as attractive while concentrated solutions are aversive. these opposing responses are reported to be perceived by different receptors and different pathways  <cit> . the epithelial sodium channel enac is involved in attractive sodium sensing and knockout of enacα in mice resulted in a complete loss of salt attraction and salt response  <cit> .

promoted by the discovery of taste receptor genes, the evolutionary history of taste perception under certain ecological and feeding behaviors has been studied in detail in recent decades. for example, tas1rs, consisting of three members, tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig>  are relatively highly conserved in almost all vertebrates  <cit> . a pseudogenized tas1r <dig> has been reported in the giant panda  and was suggested to coincide with the loss of the umami taste modality  <cit> . the chicken  has lost tas1r <dig> and thus may be insensitive to sweet compounds  <cit> , whereas three vampire bats, the hairy-legged vampire bat , common vampire bat , and white-winged vampire bat , have lost both umami and sweet taste modalities  <cit> . jiang et al.   <cit>  reported that all three tas1rs were lost in sea lion  and the common bottlenose dolphin , which is consistent with their unique feeding behavior of swallowing food whole without chewing. tas2rs are less conserved than tas1rs  <cit> . the number of tas2rs ranges from three in chicken to  <dig> in the guinea pig , with an average number of ~ <dig> in mammals  <cit> , and the similarity of tas2rs is approximately 30–70%  <cit> . by searching the dolphin genome , jiang et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that dolphins have lost sweet, umami and bitter taste perception; however, they did not investigate the other two taste modalities, sour and salt. li et al.   <cit>  investigated tas2rs gene repertoires in vertebrates, and they demonstrated that dietary toxins are a major selective force shaping the diversity of the tas2r repertoire.

to investigate the cetacean taste system and to test hypotheses proposed in previous studies, we designed degenerate pcr primers to amplify all three tas1rs, ten tas2rs, pkd2l <dig>  and three enac members  from cetacean genomes. our results indicate that almost all cetaceans have lost sour, sweet, umami and most of the bitter taste modality, while the salt taste may be the only modality retained in cetaceans.

RESULTS
loss of sour, sweet, bitter and umami taste modalities in cetaceans
we successfully amplified tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig>  pkd2l <dig>   <dig> bitter taste receptor genes , and three salt taste receptor genes  from major lineages of cetaceans  and from hippopotamidae  . these sequences were deposited in genbank . multiple orf-disrupting indels and premature stop codons were identified in sour, sweet, bitter and umami taste receptor genes in all cetaceans. tas2r <dig> was intact in the baleen whale. we mapped these mutations and premature stop codons onto all the amplified gene sequences, except for tas2r62a and tas2r62b, because useful reference sequences were not available for these two genes . furthermore, for hippopotamidae, tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> were found to be intact, but pkd2l <dig>  tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> were pseudogenized. based on the location of the first premature stop codon in the secondary structure of each protein, all these inactivation mutations are predicted to cause protein truncation . although we have tried multiple primers to amplify tas1r <dig>  we failed to amplify even one exon eventually. considering that both tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig> had been identified as pseudogenes, we speculated that the umami and sweet tastes had been lost in the cetaceans. according to sequence alignments of the three salt taste receptor genes, we did not identify any inactivation mutations in salt taste receptor genes in cetaceans or hippopotamidae. for tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig>  pkd2l <dig>  and  <dig> tas2rs genes, we only chose  <dig> cetacean species to represent most major cetacean lineages. considering that we have identified some shared indels and/or premature stop codons in these genes of some cetacean lineages, it is reasonable to make a conclusion that these genes might have become pseudogenized in cetaceans. however, it is necessary to pay more attention to sensory perception of cetaceans in the future, particularly using high-throughput dna sequencing techniques and sampling more genes in more species.figure  <dig>

six exons of tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig> stretching from nearly the beginning of the n-terminus to the end of the c-terminus were amplified in the major cetacean lineages and hippopotamidae . pkd2l <dig> is composed of an intracellular n-terminal region, a six transmembrane domain and an intracellular c-terminal region  <cit> . a total of  <dig> pkd2l <dig> exons were amplified in representative cetacean branches and hippopotamidae . bitter compounds are perceived by numerous intronless tas2rs  <cit> . jiang et al.   <cit>  have identified  <dig> tas2rs by searching dolphin’s genome, and showed dolphin may have lost bitter taste perception owing to pseudogenization of these  <dig> tas2rs. here we successfully amplified these  <dig> tas2r genes, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and used these to explore the evolution of tas2rs in extant cetaceans and hippopotamidae .

based on sequence alignments against cow  homologues, we identified multiple orf-disrupting indels and premature stop codons in tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig>  pkd2l <dig> and in ten tas2rs scattered among cetacean branches. we also found orf-disrupting mutations in pkd2l <dig> and in two bitter taste receptor genes  in hippopotamidae . all these inactivating mutations were mapped onto the species tree , and the locations of the first premature stop codons are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  for tas1r <dig>  we identified a premature stop codon shared by all cetaceans, a 5 bp deletion shared by all toothed whales and a 17 bp deletion in two baleen whales . for tas1r <dig>  a 5 bp deletion was found on the stem odontoceti , suggesting that the pseudogenization event had happened in the common ancestor of the odontoceti. the ability to sense sour-taste substances is important for protecting mammals from ingesting toxic food. for pkd2l <dig>  the sole candidate sour taste receptor, we found two premature stop codons shared by all toothed whales, excluding the dwarf sperm whale  and a premature tga stop codon shared by all cetaceans except for the baiji . interestingly, the ninth exon of pkd2l <dig> was lost in the finless porpoise  , which was confirmed by an additional eight individuals.

we amplified  <dig> tas2rs, including tas2r1- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  38– <dig>   <dig>  62a and tas2r62b in cetaceans and in five members of them in hippopotamidae members . compared with corresponding functional sequences of tas2r <dig>  we found a 1 bp deletion in three species of delphinidae, a premature stop codon  in all cetaceans except for the dwarf sperm whale, and another premature stop codon  in four toothed whales . in tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig>  we found shared orf-disrupting mutations and/or premature stop codons in all toothed whales, such as a 1 bp or a 2 bp deletion in tas2r <dig> , a shared tga premature stop codon in tas2r <dig> , and a 4 bp deletion in tas2r <dig> , suggesting that the functional loss of these genes happened in the common ancestor of toothed whales. however, we could not exclude the possibility that the pseudogenization event in tas2r <dig> might have occurred in the ancestor of all cetaceans, although we failed to amplify the whole tas2r <dig> sequence in the common minke whale . most interestingly, the common minke whale still had an intact tas2r <dig>  but whether it is still functional requires further investigation. shared inactivating mutations in tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> were all successfully mapped on the stem cetaceans, although tas2r <dig> was successfully amplified in only five species. a 1 bp deletion in tas2r <dig> , a 2 bp deletion in tas2r <dig> , a 4 bp insertion in tas2r <dig> , and a shared tga premature stop codon in tas2r <dig>  were identified, suggesting that the functional loss happened in the common ancestor of the cetaceans. for tas2r62a and tas2r62b, we could not definitively identify indels because the homologous gene in cow is a pseudogene and in dog only a portion of the gene has been reported and may, therefore, not be functional. however, we are confident that both tas2r62a and tas2r62b in cetaceans are pseudogenes because correct translation reveals multiple premature stop codons. for the three pseudogenized tas2rs of hippopotamidae, no shared orf-disrupting mutation was found between cetaceans and hippopotamidae, suggesting independent pseudogenization events in cetaceans and hippopotamidae.

relaxation of selective pressure on taste genes
to evaluate the selective pressure on these pseudogenized taste receptor genes in cetaceans, the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  were calculated . for tas1r1- <dig> and pkd2l <dig>  based on the assumption that all branches had a single ω value, purifying selection was seen across the tree for the three genes according to comparison between model a and model b . further comparison between model a and model c in which pseudogenized branches had a ω <dig> while other branches had a ω <dig> showed that ω in pseudogenized branches was significantly higher for umami, sweet, and sour taste receptor genes , indicating that functional constraint was slightly relaxed in cetaceans for tas1r1and tas1r <dig> and in cetaceans plus hippopotamidae for pkd2l <dig>  to further evaluate whether selective pressure was completely removed, we performed comparisons between model c and model d which had a fixed ω2 =  <dig> in pseudogenized branches. this analysis showed that functional constraints on tas1r1and tas1r <dig> were not completely removed in cetaceans nor on pkd2l <dig> in cetaceans plus hippopotamidae . finally, model e, which allowed different branches their own ω was significantly fixed the data than model c , indicative of variable ω across the tree for the three genes.table  <dig>

we analyzed seven bitter taste receptor genes, excluding tas2r <dig>  tas2r62a and tas2r62b because the species from which we successfully amplified tas2r <dig> were scarce, and we only retrieved pseudogenes as query sequences for tas2r62a and tas2r62b. the analysis process was similar to that for tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig> and pkd2l <dig>  and found that the functional constraints were almost completely removed from these seven tas2rs .

the shift of habitat from land to water approximately  <dig>  mya and subsequent changes in feeding behavior and habitat might have contributed to the loss of the four tastes in cetaceans. for example, basal cetaceans have several suites of synapomorphies, including reduction of the crushing basins of teeth, which suggested a major change of dental function, and development of the long and narrow postorbital and temporal region of the skull in early cetaceans. those synapomorphies could affect sense organs and may be related to dietary changes in early cetaceans  <cit> . alongside living in aquatic water environments, cetaceans have evolved unique feeding behaviors including the swallowing of food without chewing in toothed whales and filtering in baleen whales  <cit> . these behaviors further reduced their dependence on taste in the search for food resources. anatomical evidence also reveals that both toothed and baleen whales have degenerated tongue epithelia containing only few taste buds  <cit> . the tongues of the pacific whitesided dolphin , bottlenose dolphin, striped dolphin , and baiji have been reported to lack circumvallate papilla, foliate papilla and fungiform papilla  <cit> . furthermore, most cetaceans live in oceans where high concentrations of sodium might mask other taste modalities. this would further decrease their dependence on taste for seeking out prey, leading to the loss of basic taste modalities.

it is noteworthy that there are many reports detailing the distribution of tas1rs and tas2rs in non-oral cavities, including intestinal tract  <cit> , respiratory tract  <cit> , pancreas  <cit>  and brain  <cit> , and in these non-oral cavities these taste receptors can also interact with taste substances but they induce different reactions. there are also other receptors that detect small peptides and amino acids such as metabotropic glutamate receptors  and calcium-sensing receptors   <cit> . we, therefore, cannot exclude the possibility that cetaceans may retain some umami taste despite tas1r <dig> being pseudogenized. it will be interesting to investigate other candidate umami taste receptors to see whether cetaceans have completely lost the umami taste.

salt taste is the sole functional taste modality retained in cetaceans
the sense of salt taste can contribute to the ingestion of na+ and other minerals. it is widely believed that the epithelial sodium channel , composed of three homologous enacα, β and γ subunits, plays a crucial role in the perception of salt taste  <cit> . belonging to the enac/degenerin family, enac was proposed to be an α-γ-β trimer based on the structure of asic <dig> , which is another member of the enac/degenerin family  <cit> . each enac subunit consists of an intracellular n terminal region, an intracellular c terminal region, and a two-transmembrane domain  <cit> . here, we successfully amplified enacα, β and γ subunits encoded by scnn1a, scnn1b and scnn1g, respectively, in representative toothed and baleen whales and in hippopotamidae .

no inactivating mutation was identified in any of these three genes. furthermore, we have identified multiple conserved residues in cetaceans that are essential for channel function. these conserved residues reside in motifs that include the conserved proline-rich motifs containing pppxyxxl residues in the c-terminus, hg residues in the n-terminus, fpxxtxc in post-m <dig> , completely conserved residues in the second transmembrane domain , and conserved cys-rich domains in the extracellular loop  <cit> . all of these conserved motifs are essential for channel function, for example post-m <dig> and m <dig> constitute the outer pore entry and selectivity filter  <cit> , conserved hg in the n-terminus plays an important role in gating  <cit> , cys-rich domains are vital for tertiary structure of the extracellular loop  <cit> , and conserved proline-rich motifs in the c terminus take part in channel ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of the enac  <cit> . based on sequence alignments, scnn1a, scnn1b and scnn1g possessed all these conserved amino acids, except for a conserved hg in the n-terminus of scnn1a, a conserved fpxxtxc in post-m <dig>  and two important residues in the cys-rich domains of scnn1b; however these omissions are likely to be because of our incomplete gene amplification. interestingly, we identified a variable residue, γv591i, in the completely conserved m <dig> motif in the baiji. among residues with 80% or greater conservation in m <dig>  we identified a γv590i variation in toothed whales, a γv593i variation in all toothed whales except for the beaked whale , and a αm596v variation in cetaceans . these substitutions probably affect the formation of the channel pore based on their distribution in pre-m <dig> and m <dig>  which are known to participate in the formation of the channel pore. even though we could not identify all conserved sequences owing to incomplete amplification, the above analyses strongly suggested that the salt taste genes were intact.figure  <dig>

we used site models , and branch site model to test whether salt taste receptor genes were under positive selection, and clade model c  was used to identify divergent selection acting on different clades  <cit> . for scnn1g, clade model c marked all cetaceans as foreground branches, with ω3 =  <dig>  for the foreground branch and ω2 =  <dig>  for the background branch , which is significantly better than m2a_rel . our clade model showed evidence of significant divergent selection, and the ω in cetacean was greater than one, suggesting positive selection of this gene in cetacean clade. m <dig> in the site model also identified some positively selected sites, although the model was not significantly better than the null model  and the p-values of the sites were less than 95% . using the latest model fubar  <cit> , we also identified four pervasive diversifying selection sites at posterior probability ≥ <dig>  . because amino acid substitution affects proteins by altering their physicochemical properties and structure, we employed a complementary protein-level approach implemented in treesaap  <cit> . our treesaap analysis identified four significant physicochemical changes owing to amino acid residues changes in enacγ: equilibrium constant , isoelectric point, power to be at the c-terminal and tendency to form alpha-helix . selective pressure analysis of enacα and enacβ failed to identify positive signatures, suggesting that scnn1a and scnn1b are still under strong purifying selection . our treesaap analysis identified eleven and five significant physicochemical amino acid changes in enacα and β, respectively . these significant changes may contribute to cetaceans’ adaptation by increasing enac activities.

enac is widely distributed in tissues associated with na+ transport, including kidney, distal colon, lung, sweat ducts, salivary ducts and skin, and plays vital roles in these tissues  <cit> . in lung, the main function of enac is not only in ion and water homeostasis, but also in maintaining the appropriate level of hydration of the fluid layer  <cit> . enacα knockout mice die within a few days after birth because they fail to clear fetal lung liquid  <cit> . in the kidney and distal colon, enac is vital for the homeostasis of blood k+ and na+ levels, especially in the kidney where channels have an important role in overall na+ balance  <cit> . mutations in the conserved hg motifs cause a renal salt-wasting syndrome called pseudohypoaldosteronism type  <dig>   <cit> , and mutations in the conserved pppxy motif in β- and γ-enac subunits are associated with liddle’s syndrome, a form of monogenic hypertension  <cit> . cetaceans living in the hyperisotonic marine environment have to overcome the problems caused by high concentrations of sodium in the water. the osmotic pressure of urine is higher than the vascular osmotic pressure in cetaceans  <cit> . thus, the importance of enac in ion and water homeostasis and in maintaining the appropriate level of hydration of the fluid layer may have provided selective pressure to preserve salt taste receptor function in cetaceans. this is probably related to their distribution in the kidney especially in cortical collecting tubes and to their function in na+ reabsorption  <cit> . taking into consideration the degenerated tongue epithelia in cetaceans and the importance of enac in the kidney and other organs, we propose that the intact of enac may be owed to its function in kidneys and other organs. whether cetaceans can taste salt is still unknown; the answer to this question awaits further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
receptor genes for the five specific tastes were investigated among the major cetaceans and the five basic taste modalities were assessed in marine mammals. cetaceans appear to have lost four basic taste modalities including sour, sweet, umami, and the majority of the bitter taste sensation. however, as for umami taste, there are also other receptors that detect small peptides and amino acids, making it necessary to detect other candidate genes of umami to further reveal the evolution pattern of cetacean umami receptors. the integrity of salt receptor genes in all cetaceans studied here, may be owed to their function in na+ reabsorption, which is key to osmoregulation during aquatic adaptation.
