BACKGROUND
multicellular organisms maintain homeostasis through a balance between cell proliferation and death. apoptosis is a controlled cell death process crucial in a wide range of biological activities, such as normal cell turnover, immune system, embryonic development, metamorphosis, and chemical-dependent cell death  <cit> . neuronal death due to aberrant apoptosis underlies the symptoms of various neurological disorders, such as alzheimer's, parkinson's and huntington's diseases, stroke, amyotropic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis  and spinal muscular atrophy  <cit> . on the other hand, inactivation of apoptosis by blocking upstream death signals or inhibition of caspase activity by iap complex formation is central to cancer development and cellular resistance of cells against anticancer agents  <cit> .

caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play crucial roles in apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine activation, and presumably, keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . following the initial identification of caspase- <dig> in  <dig> by two different groups  <cit> , eleven caspases in humans and  <dig> in other eukaryotes have been characterized over the last decade  <cit> . in mammals, caspases are translated as inactive zymogens. while caspases- <dig> and - <dig> are activated by death receptor-mediated signals , caspase- <dig> activity is stimulated by intracellular death signals, including cytochrome c released from mitochondria . activated caspases subsequently convert procaspase- <dig> and - <dig> to fully active enzymes by specific proteolytic cleavage. caspase- <dig> is activated after caspase- <dig>  the three former caspases are known as apoptotic initiators, whereas the latter three are known as apoptotic effectors or executioners. caspase- <dig>  is the first reported apoptotic effector, and cleaves the majority of cellular substrates in apoptotic cells  <cit> . caspase- <dig> is very similar to caspase- <dig> in terms of structure and substrate specificity  <cit> . as caspase- <dig> and - <dig> are the final executioners of apoptosis, both inhibition and activation of catalytic activities are of significant interest as therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases and cancers  <cit> .

drug discovery research, including screening chemical libraries as well as structural and kinetic analyses, requires large-scale caspase- <dig> preparation. when expressed in e. coli, full-length caspase- <dig>  undergoes presumable autoprocessing to yield the appropriate subunits characteristic of the active enzyme with only a marginal expression level, probably due to its cytotoxicity  <cit> . while full-length caspase- <dig> has been expressed in pichia pastoris  <cit> , the process is long and the yield is inadequate, compared to conventional protein expression method in e. coli. the most frequently employed large-scale caspase- <dig> preparation method includes separate expression of the two insoluble domains in e. coli and subsequent refolding of the two combined domains for the active enzyme  <cit> . this method showed significantly improved protein yield. however, such a costly and time-consuming refolding process is unsuitable for efficient large-scale production for drug discovery research. here we describe a novel method for high-level expression and purification of caspase- <dig> precursors. the precursor was strategically engineered to lack auto-activation during expression with amino acid sequences susceptible to thrombin, facilitating high-level expression in e. coli. the precursor protein was activated through specific cleavage at the engineered sites by thrombin, generating active caspase- <dig>  furthermore, this protein efficiently digested endogenous caspase- <dig> substrate.

RESULTS
design of thrombin-activatable caspase- <dig> precursors for high-level expression in e. coli
caspases are translated in cells as inactive precursors, which are sequentially activated following internal or external cell death signals. apoptotic initiators, such as caspases- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  activated procaspases- <dig> and - <dig> by specific hydrolysis, thereby triggering cell death by specific apoptotic executioners  <cit> . during activation, procaspase- <dig> cleavage occurs at three sites, specifically, the c-terminal peptide bonds of asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> . as stated above, full activation of caspase- <dig> during overexpression in e. coli hampers large-scale preparation with conventional methods  <cit> . we planned to substitute the cleavage sites with specific peptide sequences that were resistant to caspase but susceptible to thrombin . consequently, the precursor protein is not activated during expression, but stimulated by thrombin at a convenient time. the mutations designed included replacement of cleavage sites with lvprgs, a well-known thrombin substrate sequence, and insertion of this sequence near cleavage sites with appropriate mutations of the cleavage site. since procaspase- <dig> releases the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids during the activation, the matured caspase- <dig>  does not have these  <dig> amino acids in its structure. therefore, the constructs that lack the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids were prepared. Δ28-caspase- <dig>  was depleted of  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus of procaspase- <dig> , while Δ28/175ts-caspase- <dig>  contained lvprgs instead of wild-type residues at positions 172– <dig> of construct ii . in the 28ts/175ts-caspase- <dig> construct , lvprgs mutations were introduced at two sites  of wild-type caspase- <dig> . in 28ts/180ti-caspase , the lvprgs motif replaced residues 25– <dig>  and was inserted between asp <dig> and asp <dig>  along with a d175a mutation to prevent auto-cleavage. since caspase- <dig> activation occurs mainly via cleavage at asp  <dig> and  <dig>  constructs were designed to ensure cleavage by thrombin at the corresponding sites . the lvprgs motif was inserted between asp <dig> and  <dig> in 28ts/180ti-caspase  to maintain the structural integrity of the sequence encompassing residues 165– <dig> after cleavage, in view of the crystal structure of active caspase- <dig>  which discloses tight interactions between this region and the other dimer within a heterotetrameric arrangement  <cit> .

expression and purification of the engineered caspase- <dig> precursors
proteins were expressed in e. coli bl <dig> rosetta , and purified by cobalt affinity chromatography. compared with wild-type, engineered proteins iii, iv and v were highly expressed  and purified up to levels of 10– <dig> mg from  <dig> l e. coli culture. interestingly, protein v displayed severe fragmentation during expression, despite the removal of known cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis. since catalytically inactive c163s caspase- <dig> did not show a significant cleavage during expression, we suspected that self-catalysis by the precursor proteins is responsible for cleavage of proteins v. hence, purified precursors were treated with catalytically active caspase- <dig> to establish whether auto-processing by precursor proteins was eliminated by mutation. while the c163s precursor protein was cleaved into two small fragments, no significant fragmentation was evident with the other proteins including protein v, implying that mutation of auto-cleavage sites blocks the auto-processing of caspase- <dig> precursors during expression . this finding also suggests that the cleavage of protein v in e. coli does not result from caspase activity, but that of another protease.

activation of engineered caspase- <dig> precursors
purified proteins iii and iv, together with the catalytically inactive c163s caspase- <dig> precursor, were treated with thrombin. as shown in fig. 2c, ~ <dig> kda single polypeptides of iii and iv were cleaved into two smaller peptides with molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig> kda , respectively. however, the c163s caspase- <dig> precursor did not display significant cleavage under similar conditions , indicating that fragmentation of iii and iv is due to specific thrombin activity at the mutated sites. notably, the cleavage sites of protein v during expression were distinct to those of thrombin. these specific sites remain to be identified. since engineered caspase- <dig> precursors have his6-tag at their c-terminus, the thrombin can be easily removed by cobalt affinity chromatography after activation of caspase- <dig> . next, the size and activity of activated engineered caspases were compared with endogenous active caspase- <dig> using page analysis. as shown in fig. 3a, all engineered caspases activated by thrombin treatment were detected at similar position to endogenous active caspase- <dig>  furthermore, proteins vi and viii cleaved parp, a well-known substrate of caspase- <dig>  at the similar level to wild-type caspase- <dig> .

kinetic analysis of caspase- <dig> precursors and activated proteins
the kinetic properties of caspase- <dig> precursors and their activated proteins were characterized using a commercially available synthetic substrate . the engineered protein precursors iii and iv containing lvprgs exhibited negligible catalytic activity . thrombin digestion of proteins iii and iv resulted in a drastic increase in catalytic activity , in agreement with a previous report  <cit>  . for example, kcat/km values representing the substrate specificities of iv and vii were determined as  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  respectively. the kcat/km value of protein v containing an insertion of the lvprgs motif between d <dig> and d <dig> was calculated as  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  which was not significantly increased upon thrombin digestion. the data indicate that protein v is already activated during expression. this finding is supported by sds-page analysis results showing four smaller bands instead of the  <dig> kda protein . considering that stennicke et al. attributed the marginal expression level of active caspase- <dig> in e. coli to the cytotoxicity of active caspase- <dig>  <cit> , it was unexpected result. as the peptide sizes of protein v were further altered by digestion with thrombin but not wild-type caspase- <dig>  we propose that cleavage during expression is attributed to the activity of another protease in e. coli. the present results are inconsistent with previous reports showing that uncleavable procaspase- <dig> mutants do not show this type of cleavage or meaningful activity  <cit> . it is envisaged that insertion of the lvprgs peptide induces a structural change in procaspase- <dig> to some degree. given that the catalytic cysteine shifts to an insignificant extent before and after the activation of caspase- <dig>  <cit> , insertion of  <dig> amino acids into the loop containing catalytic cys <dig> may be sufficient for its rearrangement to induce an active state, even without cleavage.

significant changes in kcat, rather than km values induced by mutation or activation resulted in similar substrate binding in all protein mutants, but altered catalytic activity. the km and kcat values of protein iii were  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  s- <dig>  while those of vi were  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  s- <dig>  respectively. the data correspond to  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold changes in substrate binding affinity and catalytic activity, respectively, upon activation. these findings imply that mutation or activation processes do not significantly alter the global shape of the active site, but affect the spatial arrangement of catalytic cys <dig>  in agreement with a previous report showing that activation of caspase- <dig> leads to rearrangement of a loop containing the catalytic cysteine  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate a novel strategy for a large-scale preparation of active caspase- <dig> in e. coli. thrombin-activatable caspase- <dig> precursors were designed to suppress autoprocessing, and their activation regulated by thrombin. the designed precursors were highly expressed in e. coli, easily purified, and activated by thrombin digestion, yielding 10– <dig> mg of active caspase- <dig> from  <dig> l of e. coli culture. following thrombin activation, catalytic activity was increased about 100-fold, analogous to previous findings on the wild-type precursor and mature caspase- <dig> protein. this research represents the first example to highly express a full-length caspase- <dig> as a soluble protein in e. coli, facilitating a large-scale preparation of active caspase- <dig>  this system may be effectively applied to prepare other caspases on a large scale.
