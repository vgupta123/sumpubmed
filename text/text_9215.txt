BACKGROUND
abiotic stresses such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding or chemical toxicity, pose serious threats to agricultural production. a rapid adaptation or an innate tolerance mechanism can protected the further development of the plant and importantly for yield, secure successful fruit-set. gamete development in angiosperms takes place within two floral organs; the male stamen and the female pistil  <cit> . the male gamete development starts with the differentiation of the reproductive tissues of the anther. after meiosis of the pollen mother cell and mitotic divisions, microspore maturation follows, resulting in the mature pollen grain. after initiation, highly specialized anther tissues will acquire non-reproductive  or reproductive functions . both tapetum and microspore development are essential for male fertility as documented by numerous studies on male sterile mutants  <cit> . in petunia, a cdna-aflp study revealed that during meiosis in anthers, under standard conditions, besides the typical meiotic genes, other genes are also important for the development of the pollen grains. thus, during meiosis, tapetum differentiation genes, serine-proteinases, hormone metabolism genes, genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and even ribonucleases and polyamine biosynthesis are all modulated in expression  <cit> . these genes represent members of physiological and metabolic pathways that are naturally differentially expressed during pollen biogenesis under normal conditions.

tomato  displays marked responses to heat, similar to other crop species including pepper, potato, melon, cowpea, wheat, common bean, rice and barley  <cit> . hot summers in many agricultural regions can negatively affect the vegetative and reproductive growth phases of such crops  <cit>  and can result in up to 70% losses in tomato yield  <cit> . however, heat stress has numerous specific effects depending on the genotype. physiological observations both under field and greenhouse conditions show a variable degree of tolerance between different genotypes. a wide range of heat stress phenotypes has been described  <cit> . for example, of five tomato cultivars grown under moderate heat stress  conditions , only one set fruit  <cit> . the differences in pollen grain development among the tolerant genotypes are most critical factors to determine fruit set under heat stress. comparing the effects of heat stress on a heat-tolerant and a heat-sensitive tomato cultivar showed that temperature stress affected mainly the development of pollen grains, where reduced viability was more pronounced in the heat-sensitive cultivar  <cit> .

under heat stress, it is the pollen grain development and particularly meiosis that shows the highest susceptibility, followed by germination and pollen tube growth, which in more severe cases is also significantly affected  <cit> . recently, an analysis of maturing tomato microspores  exposed to heat-shock conditions has shown no differential gene expression between heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes but it seems that the capacity for thermotolerance may be achieved by modulating the expression levels of such 'responsive' genes prior to heat stress exposure  <cit> .

in this paper we present an analysis of the different changes in gene expression in developing meiotic anthers  in response to mhs of tolerant and sensitive tomato genotypes. assuming the protective mechanisms are initiated shortly after the commencement of the stress period, we decided to study gene expression changes in the first hours of mhs. both cdna-aflp and combimatrix microarray technology were applied to obtain a general overview of molecular mechanisms that participate in the response to mhs of anthers from a heat-tolerant and two heat-sensitive genotypes of tomato. we describe a set of candidate genes and pathways that open up the possibility of understanding and modulating male heat tolerance in tomato and other commercially important solanaceae crops.

RESULTS
in order to analyse the dynamics of transcriptional responses to moderate heat stress  in meiotic anthers of tolerant and sensitive genotypes, the temperature range for the experiment was chosen based on agronomically relevant temperatures shown to have a significant effect on pollen grain viability  <cit> , rather than using classical heat shock conditions of 42°-45°c  <cit> . we focused our analysis of gene expression on whole meiotic anther cones isolated from flower buds of plants that were exposed to mhs  for up to  <dig> h, and compared this to standard temperatures . to analyse the heat stress response we used several genotypes characterised by plant breeders as relatively tolerant and sensitive.

identification of differentially expressed transcripts during mhs by cdna-aflp
the aim of this experiment was to investigate the temporal impact of mhs on gene transcription in meiotic anthers in tomato. in order to establish the most critical time points when responses to mhs are initiated and therefore a focus point for a further analysis, we used a heat-sensitive tomato cultivar  moneymaker  and recorded the number, the type of genes affected, and the timing of the transcriptional response. total rna was extracted from whole meiotic anther cones. to provide a rapid view on gene expression profiles, a modified cdna-aflp protocol was used  <cit> . figure  <dig>  shows an example of cdna-aflp profiling with up and down regulation of genes as a result of mhs. in total  <dig> cdna-aflp primer combinations were performed and this screen lead to the identification of approximately  <dig> independent transcript-derived fragments  of 100- <dig> bp. using the method described previously  <cit> , we estimate that around 30% of the transcriptome of meiotic anthers has been visualised in this screen. the cdna-aflp allows an unbiased screening of the genome and is not restricted to genes that are available in the public databases as is the case for micro array analysis.

the most marked transcriptional responses for the heat-sensitive genotype were found at  <dig> h after initiating mhs:  <dig> tdfs showed a clear differential expression pattern. of these,  <dig> showed a down-regulated pattern,  <dig> tdfs were transiently induced,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were transiently repressed. no further significant changes in gene expression were found after  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h of mhs. as a next step, a selection of tdfs exhibiting differential gene expression were sequenced in order to gain insight into the processes involved in the response to mhs.

from the total set of displayed tdfs,  <dig> were sequenced based on their potentially interesting differential expression profiles over time. table  <dig> summarises the expression patterns of these tdfs and provides the homology-based putative functions of the associated genes. using the tomato gene index ,  <dig> tdfs showed sequence similarity to stress-related genes not only from tomato but also other plant species. after submission to uniprot databases, these homologies suggested the involvement of metabolism, transport, heat shock as well as oxido-reductive processes. another  <dig> fragments showed no homology with known genes. this is likely to be due to the small size of the sequenced fragments and the bias for 3'-utr in the cdna-aflp method used  <cit> . the  <dig> identified transcripts all showed 100% identical to tomato ests  and the majority show 25% to 55% similarity  with characterized transcripts from other species. all data regarding the identified transcripts can be found in the online public geo database. the rapid change in transcriptional modulation after the initiation of heat stress suggests a short time-window to initiate protection and detoxification mechanisms.

validation of cdna-aflp expression patterns
in order to confirm the observed cdna-aflp expression profiles and also to link these to the expression patterns found in the microarray experiments described below, quantitative rt-pcr  experiments were carried out. the expression pattern of  <dig> tdfs from different functional classes was confirmed by q-pcr in the heat-sensitive genotype mm. additional confirmation and correlation between the cdna-aflp and microarray data were obtained by performing q-pcr in the two genotypes used for the microarray analysis, hs <dig>  and fr  . the q-pcr showed that transcripts similar to a  <dig> kd heat shock protein , the heat shock protein hsa <dig> , an elicitor induced protein  and an uncharacterised tdf  have similar expression patterns in the two sensitive genotypes and interestingly, contrasting expression profiles in the tolerant genotype .

we conclude that the cdna-aflp experiments showed the effect of mhs on the meiotic anther transcriptome to be visible as of  <dig> h of treatment with different effects in heat sensitive and tolerant genotypes. in response to mhs, a differential modulation of approximately 1% of the anther transcriptome was observed in the mm genotype. in an effort to identify components involved in the heat stress response, tdfs showing differential gene expression during the heat treatment have been sequenced and analysed further. the identified genes are significantly changed in expression and indicate that meiotic anther development is sensitive to heat stress as early as  <dig> h of mhs.

microarray analysis complements cdna-aflp analysis and indicates differential responses to heat stress in heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes
since cdna-aflp demonstrated changes in gene expression in the mm tomato genotype early on during mhs, we chose an early time frame  to compare the transcriptome of meiotic anthers exposed to mhs for two contrasting genotypes; hs <dig>  a heat-tolerant hybrid that sets fruit at temperatures as high as 38°c in the field and fr, a relative heat-sensitive hybrid. given the current global climate change projections  <cit> , plants that can trigger molecular mechanisms to prevent heat damage or exhibit constitutively high levels of heat tolerance are very likely to become more important for agriculture  <cit> . the effects of environmental factors are often seen in gene expression changes, as predominantly down-regulation of all gene programs for sensitive genotypes or in the case of tolerant genotypes as up-regulation of protective mechanisms  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the phenotype of flowers, anthers and pollen viability of hs <dig> and fr grown under control conditions and two weeks of mhs. while the flower morphology and pollen germination remain largely unaffected by mhs in the hs <dig> genotype , in fr mhs results in slightly smaller flowers with malformed anther cones and significantly reduced pollen germination .

in tomato, cdna-aflp and microarray technology have been previously used to dissect stress responses and already enabled identification of candidate genes for tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses such as high temperature, low temperature, salt stress and pathogen attack  <cit> . we used the combimatrix tomato array  <dig>  to compare and analyse the response to heat in a tolerant and in a sensitive genotype. modulation of gene expression in the two genotypes was analysed using multiclass, paired, and un-paired significance analysis of microarray; sam  <cit> .

to evaluate the relationship between genome-wide expression profiles of the two genotypes in relation to the heat treatment, sam multiclass analysis was performed for three consecutive time points,  <dig> h- <dig> h- <dig> h . using this statistical approach we were able to identify  <dig> genes in hs <dig> and  <dig> genes in fr whose mean expression was significantly changed across  <dig> time points or over the entire duration of the heat treatment, at a false discovery rate  of 5%. among these genes,  <dig> are shared between the two genotypes. transient up-regulation at the  <dig> h time point in both genotypes was the most common profile, and comparable to that of cdna-aflp experiment. interestingly, up-regulation showed a marked genotypic difference with  <dig> genes up-regulated in hs <dig>  in comparison to only  <dig> in fr. down-regulation of gene expression was the second most frequently observed modulation for fr  but not for hs <dig> . these modulation types also show a good correlation with the cdna-aflp data, where the sensitive mm genotype is also characterised by a considerable down-regulation of gene expression. these results suggest that the difference in tolerance to mhs between the two genotypes is mainly associated with a moderated transcriptomic response in the heat-tolerant genotype with respect to the number of differentially expressed genes and the level of expression changes.

a further analysis of the heat response per genotype was achieved by looking at differentially expressed genes between three pair wise comparisons with a sam paired analysis: t0-t <dig>  t2-t <dig>  and t0-t <dig> . the statistical nature of the sam paired analysis, in which samples are assigned to one group and there is also a one-to-one pairing between biological replicates, reveals additional information on subtle differences in the response to heat between the two genotypes, particularly in the sensitive genotype. we detected  <dig> genes in hs <dig> and  <dig> in fr, which exhibited significant changes in expression . as in the multiclass analysis, the majority were significantly different for the  <dig> h time point  with  <dig> genes significantly changed in hs <dig> compared to  <dig> genes in fr. the sam paired analysis also shows that, in the heat-tolerant hs <dig> genotype, less transcriptional changes are invested into reacting to the heat stress than in the heat-sensitive genotype fr. overall, the paired analysis shows that hs <dig> up-regulates  <dig> and down-regulates  <dig> genes, while fr up-regulates  <dig> genes and down-regulates  <dig>  clearly more when compared to the number of down-regulated genes in the heat-tolerant genotype. the sam paired analysis allows a more in-depth analysis compared to the sam multiclass analysis, suggesting not only that the difference in tolerance between the two genotypes is indeed associated with a lower transcriptional response of the heat-tolerant genotype but also with more functional classes and members affected in the sensitive genotype.

to detect if significant differences can also be found between the two genotypes prior to the heat treatment, we used the unpaired sam analysis . by using this method, where biological replicates are not paired each other between two samples,  <dig> genes were identified as significantly different between hs <dig> and fr . of these,  <dig> are significantly higher in the heat-tolerant genotype, while the other  <dig> genes are at significantly higher levels in the heat-sensitive genotype. the  <dig> genes more highly expressed in the tolerant genotype and some of the other  <dig> more highly expressed in the sensitive genotype are further discussed below with regards to their functional classification. a previous study in salt cress proposed that the salt tolerant plant had a smaller number of salt-regulated genes because of the constitutive high level of expression of stress protection-related genes even under standard growth conditions  <cit> . similarly, frank et al.  <cit>  showed that constitutive expression of a heat shock transcription factor and several heat shock proteins mark these genes as candidates for taking part in microspore thermotolerance. in our case the genes with constitutively higher expression in the tolerant genotype are the heat shock hsp <dig> , a gene coding for mitochondrial small heat shock protein  lemthsp , a cathepsin b-like cysteine proteinase  and the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase gene . we suggest that in hs <dig>  the differentially expressed genes prior to heat treatment may represent a constitutive tolerance to mhs.

the statistical analysis of gene expression during mhs reveals a differential response to heat in the two genotypes, in terms of number of significantly differentially expressed transcripts, their levels of expression and the functional classes they belong to. moreover, the analysis also shows that significant differences in gene expression are present prior to the commencement of the mhs treatment.

unlike the microarray analysis, the cdna-aflp identified genes involved in the response to heat, which may be interesting as candidates for mhs tolerance. furthermore, of the  <dig> sequenced and identified tdfs,  <dig> were also present on the microarray and  <dig> even appeared as significantly changed upon mhs on the microarray . the alternate tc numbering arose from the updated gene index release version  <dig> to version  <dig> by the dfci database .

main components determining gene expression modulation under mhs
to identify the main components determining the changes in gene expression in response to mhs, an o2pls  multivariate regression analysis of the data set was done, using the set of  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes obtained by multiclass sam analysis. this technique is well-suited for noisy and correlated variables and obtains robust classification models, having a clear interpretation of the systematic variation useful to characterize each component  <cit> . the two variables chosen were: as x the  <dig> transcripts, and as y, the  <dig> comparison classes . the opls shows four major components of variation . component  <dig> in t1/t <dig> plot separates the three time points distinctly ; in particular t <dig> separates time  <dig> from  <dig> and  <dig>  this result confirms that there is a rapid gene expression response to mhs. in addition, the o2pls analysis shows a good clustering of the biological repeats in both genotypes. component  <dig> in the t1/t <dig> plot  separates the hs <dig> and fr genotypes at  <dig> h time point and also at  <dig> h time point. this indicates that prior to the mhs treatment, there is a clear difference in gene expression in the meiotic anthers of these two genotypes. component  <dig> in the t1/t <dig> plot indicates a genotypic difference in the response to the increased period of treatment . we conclude from this analysis that the major component of variation in transcriptional changes is based on the innate genotypic differences between hs <dig> and fr prior to heat stress.

transcript profile clustering under mhs
to analyse the gene expression profiles for each genotype, a hierarchical clustering  analysis was applied to the same set of  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes also used in the o2pls analysis . the wide transcriptional response in the heat-sensitive genotype  also becomes clear with the difference between the numbers in both data sets. the largest cluster for both genotypes corresponds to a transient induction of gene expression activity, whereas up-regulation and down-regulation are the second most frequently occurring pattern in hs <dig> and fr respectively. the common probes in the different genotypes are indicated with a black line in figure  <dig>  this set has a largely similar expression profile between the two genotypes.  <dig> genes showing significant changes over the three time points are unique to the hs <dig> genotype whereas there are  <dig> unique differentials in the fr genotype . we conclude that hs <dig> shows a less extensive response in terms both of the intensity of transcriptional changes and the number of genes that are induced during mhs.

functional groups modulated by mhs
the functional classification derived from dfci gene index and uniprot annotation, illustrates the processes primarily affected in each of the genotypes. genes were organized according to the metabolic processes in which they appear to be involved. figure  <dig> shows the number of genes of each functional set illustrated as separate pie charts for the two genotypes and statistical analyses . the multiclass sam analysis of the stress response  reveals that the heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes react similarly, involving analogous functional groups: protection and repair, signalling and transcription, metabolism and development. of the genes identified, the majority belongs to the protection and repair group  in both genotypes, while the metabolism and development group is much more highly represented in the heat-sensitive genotype and shows involvement of additional response pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism and hormone-related genes, according to the sam paired analysis . by analogy, a transcriptomic analysis of tolerant and sensitive wheat strains indicates that transcripts coding for heat shock proteins, heat shock and other transcription factors are already turned on during acclimation for  <dig> h at 34°  <cit> .

protection and repair transcripts represent the majority of genes affected by mhs
from the sam paired analysis, the highest induced transcripts during the first  <dig> h of mhs in the tolerant genotype belong to the protection and repair genes and are similar to: athhsp <dig>  , a class i heat shock protein , a class iii shsp , the cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase  and a class i shsp . the highest induced transcripts in the sensitive genotype during the first two hours of mhs are a class i heat shock protein , a dna-j , a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase  and mitochondrial shsp . however, the highest induction over the entire duration of mhs was recorded in both genotypes and consists of a similar group in each genotype: class i shsp  <dig>  , class ii shsp  <dig>  , and mitochondrial shsp . of these, only the class i shsp  <dig>  is more highly induced in the tolerant genotype . a single transcript corresponding to a dna-j like protein  was down-regulated in fr over the  <dig> h of mhs, but during the last  <dig> h of mhs,  <dig> heat shock proteins were down-regulated in expression in fr and  <dig> in hs <dig> 

an additional set of genes that are differentially expressed exclusively in the heat-sensitive genotype, include heat shock proteins hsa <dig> , rof <dig>  and roc <dig>  genes that are required for protein folding. it is evident that oxido-reduction processes are affected by mhs in the heat-sensitive genotype from the differential expression of a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase  <dig> , a steroid alpha-reductase, , a flavonol synthase  and a flavoprotein . the stress response of the heat-sensitive genotype can be seen from repression of transcripts similar to pepsin a  and subtilisine . unlike the heat-sensitive genotype, the heat-tolerant genotype hs <dig> shows fewer genes significantly induced in the protection and repair group .

in conclusion, the heat-tolerant genotype hs <dig> reacts to mhs by enhancing the expression of heat shock proteins, oxido-reductive, transport and stress protective transcripts. in stark contrast, the heat-sensitive fr shows a more extensive, wider transcriptomic response characterised first by a complementary modulation pattern as compared to the heat-tolerant genotype. for example, transport and signalling genes are down-regulated in the heat-sensitive and up-regulated in the heat-tolerant. secondly, the stress response in the heat-sensitive genotype is characterised by an amplified expression of a more diverse range of functional classes including transcription, photosynthesis, hormone related and protection genes which are increased, while transport and carbohydrate metabolism are reduced in expression. thirdly, although the two genotypes involve similar functional classes in the response to heat, each genotype modulates "common" and "specific" genes, as described above. the genotype-specific modulated transcripts are of particular interest for the present work as their annotation may provide clues to the putative mechanism of heat tolerance.

the results obtained in the present study are similar to those obtained by frank et al.  <cit> , where the heat-tolerant genotype is shown to modulate fewer genes in response to heat, but also similar to results on other abiotic stresses  <cit> . the most marked differences between the two genotypes can be seen in the heat shock, metabolism and oxido-reduction groups: 32%  respectively 20%  of the modulated genes belong to the heat shock group, 12%  respectively 20%  belong to metabolic genes group and 8%  respectively 10%  belong to the oxido-reduction group. it appears that the heat-tolerant genotype modulates mainly genes in the heat shock group while the heat-sensitive genotype modulates genes of the heat shock and metabolic groups in equal fractions; processes which may underpin the better performance of the heat-tolerant genotype under elevated temperatures.

metabolism and development transcripts are the second most affected by mhs
interestingly, in comparison to the heat-tolerant genotype, all development-related genes significantly changed in expression by mhs were very highly expressed in the heat-sensitive genotype fr. in the metabolism group it is interesting to note that fr exhibits increased expression levels of carbohydrate metabolism genes as well, for example a transcript coding for beta-amylase  is induced  <dig> fold in fr during the first  <dig> h of mhs but then it is repressed again. ß-amylase induction and the resultant maltose accumulation may function as a compatible-solute stabilizing factor in the chloroplast stroma in response to acute temperature stress  <cit> .

transcription and signalling transcripts are also affected by mhs
unlike the heat-tolerant genotype hs <dig>  the heat-sensitive fr shows a different response with regard to transcription, translation and signalling. the ethylene-responsive transcriptional co-activator  is transiently induced at  <dig> h by heat only in the sensitive genotype, which may also reflect the sensitivity of fr to mhs. it is known that the a. thaliana ortholog, atmbf1c, enhances tolerance to heat and osmotic stress when over-expressed in a. thaliana  <cit> . unlike the heat-tolerant genotype hs <dig>  fr reacts with a different set of signalling partners and transcriptional regulators, down-regulating after  <dig> h of mhs a photoperiod responsive protein  and an arf5-like transcript . in arabidopsis hypocotyls, high temperature  causes an increase in free iaa, and this mediates a marked cell elongation response. therefore, temperature signals may modify auxin synthesis or distribution in the plant, and this could represent a growth-regulating mechanism  <cit> . the heat-tolerant genotype reacts to heat by continuously increasing the expression of an adagio 3-like transcript  while another bel <dig> transcriptional regulator  is decreased at  <dig> h of mhs.

in addition, the heat-tolerant genotype not only reacted differently from the heat-sensitive during heat stress but also exhibited a constitutive and specific gene expression pattern, characterised by very high expression levels of protection and repair genes. the heat shock hsp <dig>  and the gene coding for mitochondrial small heat shock protein  lemthsp  are highly expressed in hs <dig> at time point  <dig> h prior to the mhs. hsp <dig> is an hsp <dig> chaperone required for cell growth, is highly conserved among eukaryotes and the presence of at least one of the hsp <dig> gene product family members is essential for viability in yeast, drosophila, and humans. in yeast, hsp <dig> is part of the hsp <dig> chaperone, which directly interacts with hsf1p, the heat-shock transcription factor from yeast  <cit> . the reduction in tomato mitochondrial small hsp lemtshp expression, also known as hsp <dig>   <cit>  seems to lead directly to susceptibility to heat stress. in addition, a transcript similar to a cathepsin b-like cysteine proteinase  is also constitutively higher expressed in the tolerant genotype. cysteine proteinases have a positive role in plant growth, development, senescence and programmed cell death, but also in storage protein mobilization  <cit> . all these  <dig> genes are significantly increased after  <dig> h of mhs. the heat-tolerant genotype also exhibited a constitutive and specific gene expression pattern, characterised by differential expression levels of a carbohydrate metabolism gene, the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase , which is highly expressed in hs <dig> at time point  <dig> h prior to the mhs. the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase is an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. reports from several laboratories have suggested that increased rates of glycolysis play an essential role in the initiation of dna synthesis and may be involved in maintenance of replication and protein activity at high temperature  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that in general, the heat-tolerant genotype hs <dig> appears to have an enhanced innate heat protection system exemplified by the hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> levels before and during the treatment. furthermore, hs <dig> seems to have a lower rate of metabolism as exemplified by the low number of genes significantly changed in comparison to the sensitive genotype, not only before the treatment but also during the  <dig> h of mhs.

unlike hs <dig>  the sensitive genotype fr exhibits an increased number of genes  with a constitutively higher expression prior to the mhs, which may also indicate the sensitivity of this genotype to adverse conditions. for example, the highest constitutive expression in the sensitive genotype compared to the tolerant genotype is of genes that belong to the stress response pathway , metabolism  and interestingly, in development  or transcription . of the genes constitutively higher expressed in the sensitive genotype,  <dig> are down-regulated within the first  <dig> h of mhs and only  <dig> is not affected at all by the mhs treatment .

the analysis of the stress response reveals that the tolerant and sensitive genotypes react largely by involving similar functional classes: heat shock, oxido-reduction, photosynthesis, stress response, protection, development, transcription and transport. the nature of the genes and intensity of their expression level is very genotype specific as has been described above. however, the group of transcript significantly changed in both genotypes shows probably the general response to heat and comprises in majority genes from the heat shock, metabolism and oxido-reduction functional classes.

the majority of "common" transcripts generally show the same induction pattern in both genotypes, but very often at different expression levels. however, the question whether they are relevant for tolerance is still open. for example, expression of a transcript similar to hsp  <dig>  , a class i shsp is higher and transiently induced at two hours of mhs in fr. a transcript similar to hsc <dig>  is also more highly expressed in fr as an result of heat. other transcripts similar to class i and class iii heat shock proteins are expressed more highly in the tolerant genotype in the first  <dig> h of stress. oxidation and reduction genes are also induced over the first  <dig> h of heat and they are similarly induced in both genotypes, for example a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase ; a central component of the reactive oxygen gene network in arabidopsis  <cit> , is more highly induced in the tolerant genotype than in the sensitive genotype. a metallothionein-like protein type  <dig> b  involved in cellular response to stress  <cit>  is expressed and transiently induced at a higher expression level in the sensitive genotype. tc <dig>  corresponding to a chalcone synthase  <dig> b involved in flavonoids biosynthesis, well known for its antioxidant properties  <cit> , continuously decreases in expression in the two genotypes but the decrease is more pronounced in the sensitive genotype during the first  <dig> h of mhs. photosynthesis is also affected, for example rubisco activase  is equally increased at  <dig> h of mhs then decreased at the end of the heat treatment in both genotypes, however with a higher level in the sensitive genotype. interestingly, expression of a transcript similar to the zeatin o-glucosyltransferase zog  decreases in the tolerant genotype over the entire duration of mhs but transiently decreasing in the sensitive genotype. the significance of this particular expression pattern may lie in the fact that zog regulates responses to water deficits and thus regulates stress protection by increasing active cytokinin levels  <cit> .

it is clear that numerous biochemical pathways and metabolic routes are affected by mhs and the range of responses is generally broader in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant. thus it is not yet clear which genes are most directly involved in tolerance or in sensitivity to heat stress.

validation of microarray expression data
in order to confirm the observed microarray expression profiles, q-pcr experiments were carried out. the expression pattern of five transcripts, from different functional classes was confirmed in the heat tolerant hs <dig> and the heat-sensitive fr genotypes, showing that heat have a clear influence on gene expression. additional confirmation and correlation was obtained by performing q-pcr in another pair of contrasting genotypes: saladette  and pull . transcripts coding for heat shock, transport and protection proteins show similar expression patterns to the ones observed from the sam analyses. in addition, the second pair of contrasting genotypes showed a similar modulation in gene expression .

CONCLUSIONS
our transcript profiling experiments and those from others  <cit>  demonstrate that many genes, involved in seemingly unrelated processes, are modulated by moderate heat stress. expression of many of these genes is also modified in sensitive as well as in relative tolerant lines, differing only in amplitude. this suggests that tolerance is based on fine-tuning of quantitative expression of many genes. it is difficult to say whether the differences observed in our experiments are the basis of heat tolerance or solely a consequence of a better performing plant under stress conditions independent of a causative link. furthermore, it is possible that different mechanisms exist in tomatoes, which have been selected during cultivation in different part of the world. the selection of tomato in cultivation is based on a small set of domestication genes causing little genetic variation in the tomato germplasm  <cit> . based on this, an unintended selection during cultivation for epigenetic factors causing differential gene expression could partly explain differences in stress adaptation.
