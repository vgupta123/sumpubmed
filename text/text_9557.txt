BACKGROUND
the mammalian innate immune system utilises a number of protein receptors for the identification of microbial molecules. amongst these are several receptors specific for foreign ribonucleic acids , including toll-like receptor  <dig> , tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  rig-i, mda <dig> and pkr . these receptors are specifically activated by different microbial rna features, including double-strandedness   <cit> , extracellular or endosomal localization   <cit>  and/or the presence of 5'-triphosphates   <cit> . the engagement of these receptors by their cognate ligands induces the expression of anti-viral genes, including cytokines and type i interferons .

short interfering rnas  are routinely used in laboratory settings, and hold promise for a range of therapeutic applications  <cit> . although initially thought to bypass the innate immune system by virtue of their size  <cit> , sirnas have more recently been shown to induce immune stimulation in a variety of in vivo, and in vitro settings . synthetic sirna duplexes have now been show to activate pkr in glioblastoma cells  <cit> , rig-i in glioblastoma cells and primary human monocytes  <cit> , tlr <dig> in hek <dig> cells and murine models  <cit> , tlr <dig> in murine leukocytes and human plasmacytoid dendritic cells  <cit> , and tlr <dig> in human monocytes  <cit> . in addition, a number of groups have demonstrated innate immune stimulation by sirnas in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  without defining the cell or receptor specificity  <cit> .

whilst the activation of rig-i, pkr and tlr <dig> described above does occur with specific types of sirna and in specific cellular contexts, it appears that the major innate immune response to standard  <dig> mer sirnas  is activation of tlr <dig> and/or tlr <dig> in leukocytes  <cit> . in isolated human leukocytes immune stimulation has been shown to be mediated by tlr7/ <dig> activation since it is dependent upon endosomal maturation , and mediated by single-stranded rna in a sequence-dependent fashion   <cit> . sequence-dependent activation of tlr <dig> by such sirna has been demonstrated in primary human pdcs, murine leukocytes and in in vivo murine models  <cit> . sequence-dependent activation of human monocytes through an endosomal pathway has also been reported  <cit> , presumably through activation of tlr <dig> which is the primary sensor of single-stranded rna in these cells  <cit> . stimulation of human pbmcs with sirna can lead to production of either ifnα or tnfα or both simultaneously, leading to the hypothesis that differences in the sequence specificity of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> may cause a given immunostimulatory sequence to activate pdcs through tlr <dig> and/or monocytes through tlr <dig>  <cit> .

tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are both activated by single-stranded rna. the precise sequence requirements for their activation have not yet been elucidated, however, it has been demonstrated that g and u rich sequences tend to stimulate tlr <dig> causing ifnα production from pdcs, and a and u rich sequences tend to stimulate tlr <dig> causing production of both ifnα and tnfα from monocytes  <cit> . it has not yet been determined whether these base preferences also affect the activation of tlr7/ <dig> by sirna . however, it has been shown that tlr7/ <dig> immunostimulatory duplex sirnas are less active than their component single strands, suggesting that activation of tlr7/ <dig> by sirnas is induced by the latter  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, specific g and u rich tlr <dig> stimulatory motifs  have been identified in the single strand components of two sirna duplexes  <cit> .

thus, it appears that the primary mechanism of innate immune stimulation by sirnas is the activation of tlr7/ <dig> by a single strand of the sirna duplex . in the present study, we have investigated the sequence requirements for sirna stimulation of tlr7/ <dig> by screening  <dig> sirna sequences for stimulation of human pbmcs. we found that sequence motifs and the thermodynamic properties of the duplexes appeared to be the major determinants of sirna immunogenicity. in addition, we have identified a number of highly immunogenic rna sequences.

RESULTS
assay development
in order to determine the determinants of immunogenicity of sirnas, we initially sought to develop a sensitive and relatively high-throughput assay for the detection of innate immune stimulation by short duplex rnas. the logical choice of target cells for such an assay is primary human pbmcs, which have been shown to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and ifn in response to sirnas, through activation of tlr <dig> and/or tlr <dig>  <cit> . these primary cells have the additional advantage that, unlike tlr <dig> transfected immortalised cell lines, they appear to fully recapitulate in vivo tlr signalling  <cit> . we and others  <cit> , had shown that the human hepatoma cell line huh <dig>  harbouring an hcv replicon that expresses a luciferase reporter, is a sensitive and easily assayed system for detection of ifn. therefore, we chose to employ an assay system in which innate immunostimulation of pbmcs by sirnas is detected using inhibition of hcv replication as a surrogate marker for ifn production. such assay systems have been shown to be dependent on immune stimulation of the leukocytes  and to be dependent upon secretion of ifnα from the activated leukocytes   <cit> .

to determine the optimal density of pbmcs for such an assay, non-cryopreserved primary human pbmcs at densities of 5– <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ <dig> μl were treated with  <dig> nm  sirnas complexed with dotap . after  <dig> hours, the supernatant was transferred to huh7-luc cells, which were incubated for a further  <dig> hours to allow inhibition of hcv replication by ifn, before luciferase expression was assayed. a range of different sirnas were tested. of these, three  were variants of the same gfp targeting sirna, which had been shown to induce cytokine and ifn induction in pbmcs  <cit>  and differed only in length and the presence or absence of 3'  <dig> nucleotide overhangs; one  was an influenza a targeting sirna which had been shown to induce off-target immune effects  <cit> ; three  were commercially obtained control sirna without target sites in the human transcriptome; and two  were designed to target a cyan fluorescent protein gene. in the absence of sirna  there was a cell density-dependent suppression of hcv replication  with background hcv suppression of the order of 50% at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmc/ <dig> μl . by contrast, background hcv inhibition was slight at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmcs/ <dig> μl. at this density, hcv inhibition was observed following treatment of the pbmcs with almost all of the sirnas, with  <dig> sirnas inducing 100% hcv inhibition . thus,  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmcs/ <dig> μl appeared to provide the necessary dynamic range for assaying innate immune stimulation by sirnas, and this density was used for further experiments.

in order to demonstrate that the pbmc/huh7-luc assay system was capable of measuring differences in immunostimulatory activity between different sirnas, we assessed the dose responses of  <dig> of the above mentioned sirna:  <dig> strong immunostimulants  and  <dig> moderate immunostimulants . each of these duplexes induced a dose-dependent response from pbmc, with clear differences between the activity of each detectable in this assay . this response was dependent upon endosomal maturation , since pre-treatment of the pbmcs with chloroquine inhibited ifnα production in a dose-dependent manner.

screening sirna duplexes for tlr7/ <dig> activation
having established a working assay for tlr7/ <dig> activation by sirna, we sought to identify the sequence determinants of this activation. we performed a 4-point  dose response curve for  <dig> sirna duplexes  complexed with dotap. at a concentration of  <dig> nm, we observed a range of innate immune stimulation from undetectable up to the maximum quantifiable by the assay . the immunostimulation observed was dependent upon endosomal maturation, since pre-treatment of the pbmcs with chloroquine abrogated replicon suppression for every sirna duplex tested . since it seemed probable that denaturation of the strands was required for activation of tlr7/ <dig>  we compared the observed suppressive activity with the free energy of hybridisation of the duplex. we found a significant correlation  between this parameter and immunostimulatory activity , suggesting that denaturation of the strands was indeed required for activation of tlr7/ <dig> 

although apparently affected by characteristics of the duplex , immune activation of pbmcs by sirnas generally appears to be mediated by a single u rich strand of the sirna  <cit> . we compared the u content of both strands in each of the  <dig> duplexes, and selected the strand with the higher u content as being the probable immunostimulatory strand. consistent with this model, there was a significant correlation between the u count of the u-rich strand and the immunostimulatory activity of the duplex . g content has also been postulated to promote activation of tlr7/ <dig>  <cit> , however, we saw no correlation between combined u+g content and activity .

the above analysis made the assumption that the more u rich strand of each duplex was responsible for the majority of the immunostimulatory activity observed for that duplex. to assess the validity of this assumption, we investigated the immunostimulatory activity of the individual strands from  <dig> of the most highly immunostimulatory duplexes . in each case, the u-rich strand elicited greater ifn production from pbmcs , confirming the underlying premise of the analysis and validating the findings of previous studies that tlr  <dig> is not involved in the sensing of sirna molecules in isolated human leukocytes .

to identify the sequence determinants of tlr7/ <dig> activation by sirnas, we performed alignments of the u-rich strands from each of the duplexes. for this analysis, we excluded those sirnas in which both strands had equal u content, leaving  <dig> duplexes for analysis. the frequency of each base at each position was determined for the top and bottom quartiles of activity , and this was compared to the relative frequencies of each base in the u-rich strand of the population . from this analysis, several sequence features that promoted or impaired tlr7/ <dig> activation were suggested. features that appeared to promote tlr7/ <dig> activation were: g bases at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  a bases at positions  <dig>   <dig> and from 16– <dig>  an absence of c bases in positions 16– <dig>  and an absence of g bases from positions 5– <dig> and  <dig>  features that appeared to impair tlr7/ <dig> activation were: c bases at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and g bases at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  most of the duplexes tested included 3' overhangs comprising uu or tt  dinucleotides. we also found that tt overhangs were over represented in the bottom quartile of immunostimulatory activity, suggesting that uu overhangs can, in some cases, contribute to the activation of tlr7/ <dig>  these features suggested that the degree of tlr7/ <dig> activation induced by a given duplex is dependent upon stimulatory motifs in the u-rich strand , but is impaired by cg or gc "clamps" which inhibit the release of the active strand from the duplex.

to more specifically investigate the effect of each of the above-mentioned sequence features on the tlr7/ <dig> activation activity of sirnas, we tested the immunostimulatory activity of a number of sirnas specifically designed to incorporate these features in a poly-u background. compared with a poly-u/poly-a duplex, duplexes containing even a single g-nucleotide at either position  <dig> or position  <dig> of the u-rich strand demonstrated strikingly increased immunostimulation of pbmcs . introduction of a-nucleotides at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  or  <dig> and  <dig> produced more modest increases in activity. treatment of pbmcs with the u-rich strand alone recapitulated  the immunostimulatory activity of the duplex. by contrast, none of the corresponding a-rich complementary strands demonstrated activation of tlr7/ <dig> . dose responses for the individual u-rich strands containing g-nucleotides, indicated an additive effect of g-nucleotides at position  <dig> and  <dig>  but inclusion of a-nucleotides at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not appear to increase activity further . when pbmcs were replaced in the assay by purified pdcs , g-nucleotides at positions  <dig> or  <dig> again caused substantial increases in immunostimulatory activity, with position  <dig> appearing to produce a stronger effect than position  <dig> . in pdcs, however, the inclusion of a-nucleotides in the u-rich strand had only a very modest effect on immunostimulatory activity, and inclusion of a-nucleotides in a sequence containing g-nucleotides at positions  <dig> and  <dig> actually decreased immunostimulation. these findings suggest that a nucleotides may preferentially affect recognition of short rnas by tlr <dig> 

inclusion of features  predicted to decrease the immunostimulatory activity of the duplex generally led to increases in immunostimulation of both pbmcs and pdcs relative to poly-u for both the u-rich single strand and the annealed duplex . however, given the marked enhancement in activity observed for poly-u oligos containing even a single g-nucleotide , it appeared likely that any impairment of tlr7/ <dig> stimulation conferred by increased hybridisation strength may have been masked by the much greater stimulatory activity of the u-rich strand following introduction of a cg or gc "clamp". this hypothesis was supported by the observation that despite the individual u-rich strands of the cg/gc containing duplexes exhibiting potent immunostimulatory activity relative to poly-u, this activity was largely negated in several of the corresponding duplexes, most notably the rna duplex  which contained  <dig> cg/gc "clamps". this effect was also observed in purified pdcs, in which all of the cg/gc containing duplexes demonstrated reduced immunostimulatory activity relative to the u-rich strand alone .

the above findings suggested that cg or gc clamps interspersed along the length of an sirna duplex act to inhibit tlr7/ <dig> activation by increasing the strength of hybridization between the two strands, and thus impair the release of stimulatory single-stranded rna. however, introduction of such clamps into the sirna duplex complicates the analysis by appearing to increase the stimulatory activity of the active single stranded rna sequence through the introduction of g nucleotides. to specifically test the effect of increasing the strength of the hybridisation interaction without changing the sequence of the stimulatory strand, we used locked nucleic acid  chemistry. lna bases were incorporated into the non-stimulatory strand of  <dig> highly active duplexes  at positions corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> of the stimulatory strand , and the immunostimulatory activity of these duplexes was assessed in pbmcs . in each case we found that duplexes containing lnas were significantly less active than the corresponding fully-ribonucleotide duplex. this finding was in contrast to a previous report, in which an sirna <dig>  duplex including  <dig> lna bases at both the 5' and 3' ends of non-stimulatory strand of the duplex was no less immunostimulatory than a fully-ribonucleotide duplex  <cit> . to assess whether this discrepancy was related to differences in the assay technique, we tested such an lna modified sirna in our assay. lna modification of the  <dig> terminal hybridizing bases of the non-stimulatory strand did not significantly decrease the immunostimulatory activity of the duplex, a result that was highly consistent with previous findings. the reason that, in this case, lna modification in the centre of the duplex impairs immunostimulation whereas lna modification at the termini does not is not clear. it is possible that in terminally modified duplexes the centre section may be sufficiently denatured in the endosome to activate tlr7/ <dig> signalling. alternatively, it is possible that this specific terminally modified rna strand forms a hairpin, making it unavailable for duplex formation and thus ineffective in impairing tlr7/ <dig> activation, however, further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities.

it has been proposed that sirnas activate tlr <dig> in pdcs leading to ifn production, and/or tlr <dig> in monocytes leading to ifn and tnfα production  <cit> . to investigate the sequence specificity of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation, we tested  <dig> of the sirnas that we had shown to induce ifn production in pbmcs for ifn production in pdcs , and tnfα production in pbmcs . we observed a range of activities for both ifn production from pdcs  and tnfα production from pbmcs, although the tlr <dig> response in pdcs was saturated in many cases . the specificity of these assays for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation was confirmed by the respective responses to the tlr <dig> selective agonist cl <dig>  and the tlr <dig> selective agonist cl <dig>  given that immunostimulatory sirnas might be expected to exhibit a preference for stimulation of either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> and that the initial screen for activity  measures combined ifn production from tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulation, it might be expected that tnfα production from pbmcs and ifn production from pdcs would exhibit negative correlation. however, no such correlation was observed . for both tnfα production from pbmcs, and ifn production from pdcs, moderate correlation was observed with overall ifn production from pbmcs , suggesting that the differences in the affinity of each individual sirna for its receptor may be masking any trend. however, normalisation of both tnfα production in pbmcs and ifn production in pdc to overall ifn production from pbmcs failed to reveal a negative correlation between ifn production from pdcs and tnfα production . thus, although a small number of individual sirnas with strong preferences for tlr <dig>  were identified, there were too few such sequences to draw conclusions about sequence determinants of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> preference. for the subset of  <dig> immunogenic sirnas described above, we also investigated both il- <dig> and ip- <dig> expression by elisa. il- <dig> expression correlated with tnfα expression . ip- <dig> was induced approximately equally by all sequences tested , and so did not allow any discrimination between sequences.

the studies described above were all performed using standard format  <dig> mer sirnas with  <dig> base 3' overhangs. however, a number of other sirna formats have been described in the literature, including sirnas of varying lengths, "blunt"-ended sirnas, hairpin rnas and sirnas incorporating dna nucleotides  <cit> . we tested the immunostimulatory properties of a range of different sirna formats based upon  <dig> different sequences . no discernable trend was detected , although longer sequences , did appear to be generally slightly more immunostimulatory. however, other factor than format  appear to have been the major determinants of immunogenicity, and given the small number of sequences used  we do not consider these results to be conclusive.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have used a broad-based screening strategy to identify sequence determinants of tlr7/ <dig> activation by standard format duplex sirna molecules. we found that sequence motifs contained in a single, u-rich strand of the sirna duplex were a major determinant of activity, as demonstrated by the profound increase in immunostimulation caused by the introduction of even a single g-nucleotide into a poly-u sequence. we also found that the thermodynamic properties of the duplex affected tlr7/ <dig> activation, and that the strength of the hybridisation interaction between the two strands correlated negatively with immunostimulatory activity. thus, our findings suggest a model of tlr7/ <dig> activation by sirnas, in which the two strands are denatured in the endosome, and single-stranded, u-rich rna species activate tlr7/ <dig>  in the course of these studies, we have also identified several rna species that stimulate tlr7/ <dig> more strongly than any previously identified agent that we are aware of. these findings have relevance to the design of sirnas  and to the understanding of the physiological mechanisms of tlr7/ <dig> activation. the highly immunostimulatory rna species that we have identified may also be useful in the development of pharmacological agents with anti-viral or vaccine adjuvant applications.
