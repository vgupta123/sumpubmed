BACKGROUND
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is a basidiomycetous carotenogenic yeast and is one of the few known natural sources of xanthophyll astaxanthin 
 <cit> . carotenogenesis may have evolved as a cellular defense mechanism against oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species  produced by biochemical and photochemical systems
 <cit> . among carotenoids, astaxanthin stands out for its potent antioxidant properties and other beneficial effects on human health
 <cit> . moreover, this pigment has been widely used in aquiculture to color the flesh of cultured salmonids. because the characteristic pigmentation is highly desired by consumers, astaxanthin availability has an impact on production costs
 <cit> . due to its prevalent use in the food, aquiculture, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and the increasing demand for natural products, astaxanthin and its sources have great commercial potential
 <cit> .

carotenoids are tetraterpenoid compounds that are biosynthesized in the isoprenoid  pathway ; the basic units are isopentenyl-pyrophosphate  and its isomer dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate 
 <cit> . although an alternate pathway has been described , ipp is synthesized from acetyl-coa via the mevalonate  pathway in most eukaryotes
 <cit> . five genes control this pathway, and among them, the expression of the gene that encodes hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa  reductase, hmgr, is strongly regulated at different levels 
 <cit> . in the isoprenoid synthesis pathway , dmapp and ipp are condensed by prenyl transferases to form geranyl-pyrophosphate , and the addition of a second molecule of ipp gives rise to farnesyl pyrophosphate 
 <cit> . squalene, the precursor of sterols, is formed by the condensation of two molecules of fpp by squalene synthase
 <cit> . for the biosynthesis of carotenoids, a third ipp unit is added to fpp, generating geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate . the condensation of two molecules of ggpp forms the first carotenoid in this biosynthetic pathway, phytoene
 <cit> . during x. dendrorhous carotenogenesis, lycopene is formed by four successive desaturations of phytoene; cyclization of the ends of lycopene produces beta-carotene
 <cit> . unlike other astaxanthin-producing organisms, x. dendrorhous has a single astaxanthin synthase  that catalyzes the ketolation and hydroxylation of beta-carotene to produce astaxanthin
 <cit> . this enzyme is related to a 3a sub-family member of the cytochrome p <dig> protein family
 <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> proteins  are heme-containing monooxygenases that are present in organisms from all domains of life
 <cit> ; p450s have significant roles in the oxidative metabolism of many exogenous and endogenous substrates
 <cit> . in their active state, these enzymes are reduced by electrons that are supplied by nadh through a p <dig> redox partner
 <cit> , which in eukaryotes is a cytochrome p <dig> reductase
 <cit> . in x. dendrorhous, the crtr gene encodes the yeast cytochrome p <dig> reductase that is essential for the synthesis of astaxanthin
 <cit> . however, the x. dendrorhous crtr gene is different from the crtr gene originally described in cyanobacterium synechocystis sp., which encodes a beta-carotene hydroxylase
 <cit> .

sterols and carotenoids are derived from ipp. sterols are essential structural and regulatory components of eukaryotic cell membranes, modulating their thickness, fluidity and permeability
 <cit> . ergosterol is the principal sterol in yeasts, and two cytochrome p450s are involved in its biosynthesis: cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> , which in saccharomyces cerevisiae are encoded by the erg <dig> and erg <dig> genes, respectively
 <cit>  . an erg5-s. cerevisiae mutant strain is viable but unable to synthesize ergosterol
 <cit> . interestingly, one of the major bottlenecks in ergosterol biosynthesis is the reaction catalyzed by hmg-coa reductase
 <cit> . as mva is a common precursor in ergosterol and carotenoid biosynthesis, its synthesis should also be an important bottleneck in the biosynthesis of astaxanthin in x. dendrorhous. based on these observations, this study aimed to identify and characterize the x. dendrorhous c- <dig> sterol desaturase encoding gene, cyp <dig>  and to evaluate the effect of its disruption on yeast ergosterol production and carotenogenesis.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of the cyp <dig> gene from x. dendrorhous
our x. dendrorhous genomic database was analyzed with the blast tool of the clc genomics workbench  <dig> software using as query several cyp <dig> gene sequences available in the genbank database. in this way, we were able to identify a putative cyp <dig> gene  from x. dendrorhous, which allowed us to design specific primers to amplify and clone this gene.

a fragment of approximately  <dig>  bp  was pcr-amplified using genomic dna from strain ucd 67– <dig> as a template and the primer set cyp61up <dig> f + cyp61dw <dig> r . this fragment was inserted at the ecorv site of the pbluescript sk- plasmid, generating pbs-gcyp <dig>  in parallel, the x. dendrorhous cyp <dig> cdna was screened in a cdna library by pcr using plasmid dna from different clone mixtures as templates and the primer pair cyp <dig> f + cyp <dig> r . the recombinant plasmid pbs-ccyp <dig>  which contained the cyp <dig> gene cdna with an orf of  <dig>  bp , was isolated. the sequence analysis of the genomic and cdna versions of the cyp <dig> gene allowed us to determine that this gene consists of nine exons of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, and eight introns of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp . the cyp <dig> gene encodes a putative  <dig> amino acid cyp <dig> protein with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig> . the cyp <dig> deduced protein from x. dendrorhous shares 43% identity and 65% similarity at 95% sequence coverage with the saccharomyces cerevisiae c22-sterol desaturase . this protein belongs to the cytochrome p <dig> protein family and is involved in the second last step of the ergosterol biosynthesis, the conversion of  <dig> ,24-ergostatrienol into  <dig> , <dig> -ergostatetraenol
 <cit> .

f and r in the primer name indicate the primer orientation.

the cyp <dig> gene from several x. dendrorhous strains  was pcr-amplified using pfu dna pol, and each amplicon was sequenced . we found several base changes, but most of them were located in the intronic regions. only four base changes produced amino acid replacements; the adenine, guanine, guanine and cytosine at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were converted to guanine, adenine, adenine and thymine , resulting in t12a, a27t, r306k and p409s variations at the deduced amino acid sequence, respectively .

even though the amino acid sequences are extremely diverse among the cytochrome p <dig> protein family, their structural fold is highly conserved
 <cit> . several cytochrome p <dig> secondary structural elements in the deduced cyp <dig> protein from x. dendrorhous were predicted with the cyp <dig> engineering database
 <cit>  . this included alpha helices a, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, k’ and l, beta-sheets 1– <dig>  1- <dig>  1– <dig>  3– <dig>  1– <dig>  2– <dig>  2– <dig>  1– <dig>  3– <dig>  4– <dig>  4– <dig> and 3– <dig>  the meander loop, which may be involved in the stabilization of the tertiary structure and heme binding, and the cys pocket that contains the conserved cysteine involved in heme binding. there are three totally conserved amino acids in the cytochrome p <dig> protein family, the glutamic acid and arginine of the e-x-x-r motif at the k-helix, which are involved in stabilizing the core and heme binding, and the heme binding cysteine
 <cit> , and these residues are present in the predicted cyp <dig> protein. additionally, we were able to predict the putative hydrophobic transmembrane segment at the cyp <dig> amino terminus, which could anchor the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum
 <cit> .

the cyp <dig> gene mutation
to study the function of the cyp <dig> gene in x. dendrorhous, mutant cyp61- strains were generated. the wild-type strains ucd 67– <dig> and cbs  <dig> were transformed with plasmid pbs-cyp61/hyg, and strain avhn <dig> was transformed with plasmid pbs-cyp61/zeo. all transformations were performed with linearized plasmids as indicated in figure 
 <dig>  through a double homologous recombination event, the donor dna fragment containing the cyp <dig> gene interrupted by one of the two resistance markers replaced the cyp <dig> gene in the yeast chromosome. in this way, we obtained the transformant strains 385-cyp61hph, cbs-cyp61hph and av2-cyp61zeo . the genotype modifications in the transformant strains were validated by pcr reactions using specific primers for the cyp <dig> gene, zeocin or hygromycin b resistance cassettes  and genomic dna from the parental and transformant strains. the amplicons confirmed the cyp <dig> gene interruption . however, as strain ucd 67– <dig> is diploid
 <cit>  and we were able to detect a cyp <dig> wild-type allele, the resulting strain 385-cyp61hph is heterozygous . for this reason, strain 385-cyp61/cyp61hph was transformed with the linearized plasmid pbs-cyp61/zeo obtaining the cyp61- homozygote mutant strain 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo . the ploidy levels of strains cbs  <dig> and avhn <dig> are unknown; based on random mutagenesis experiments and by transformation of carotenogenic genes performed at our laboratory
 <cit> , we estimate that these strains are aneuploid. in these cases, the pcr-based genotype analysis determined that a unique cyp <dig> gene copy was mutated in strains cbs-cyp61hph and av2-cyp61zeo , indicating that these strains are hemizygous, so a second transformation event was not necessary in these mutants. interestingly, a clear difference in the color phenotype could be distinguished among all the cyp61- mutants and their corresponding parental strains, indicating alterations in carotenoid biosynthesis .

cyp <dig> gene mutant phenotype evaluation: ergosterol and carotenoid production
to analyze and compare the cyp61- mutant phenotypes, the seven strains ucd 67– <dig>  385-cyp61/cyp61hph, 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo, cbs  <dig>  cbs-cyp61hph, avhn <dig> and av2-cyp61zeo were cultivated in ym complete medium for  <dig> days at 22°c with constant agitation. growth was measured by the culture absorbance at  <dig> nm, and samples were taken after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of cultivation. the samples were processed to determine the yeast dry weight and to extract sterols, carotenoids and rna as described in the materials and methods section.

as in other species, the cyp <dig> gene is involved in the ergosterol biosynthesis, so we evaluated the sterol production and composition in the cyp61- mutants by rp-hplc. figure 
 <dig> shows representative chromatograms obtained from sterols extracted from strains ucd 67– <dig> and 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo, representing the parental and the cyp61- mutant strains, respectively. in wild-type strains, we observed a predominant peak  at the  <dig> nm channel at approximately  <dig> min with the ergosterol characteristic spectra , and its identity was confirmed by co-injecting each sample with standard ergosterol . on the other hand, in the analysis of the sterols from the homozygous and hemizygous cyp61- mutants, two peaks were observed with retention times close to  <dig>  and  <dig> min  . these two peaks did also have the sterols characteristic spectra, but their retention time was different than that of ergosterol. this last observation was also confirmed by co-injecting the extracted sterols with standard ergosterol, resulting in three peaks at approximately  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min . additionally, the identity of the sterols was determined by gc-ms , confirming that wild-type strains produced mainly ergosterol and that the mutants instead accumulated ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol and ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol. considering the relative abundance of each sterol obtained by gc-ms and rp-hplc, peaks  <dig> and  <dig> in the rp-hplc chromatogram from the cyp61- mutant strain  should correspond to ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol and ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol, respectively.

table 
 <dig> summarizes the sterol composition of the seven strains at different cultivation times. in general, when compared to the corresponding parental strain, the total sterol content was greater in the cyp61- mutants. in addition, the sterols produced by the cyp61- mutant strains corresponding to peaks  <dig> and  <dig> were at ratios of 55% and 44%, 32% and 68%, 48% and 52% in the 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo, cbs-cyp61hph, av2-cyp61zeo strains, respectively. in the heterozygous strain 385-cyp61/cyp61hph, the main sterol produced was ergosterol.

a visible change in the color of the cyp61- mutants was evident when compared to their corresponding parental strain . the first ones had a more intense red color, suggesting that the mutant strains produced more carotenoids. this observation was confirmed by carotenoid extraction and quantification from the seven strains after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of cultivation; the pigment composition was analyzed by rp-hplc . the cyp61- mutants produced more carotenoids than their corresponding parental strains without other major alterations in their composition. in all cases, the maximum carotenoid content was reached after  <dig> h of cultivation, which coincides with the late stationary phase of growth . in general at this time, the major differences in total carotenoid content were observed among the analyzed strains. the total carotenoid contents relative to the parental strains after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of cultivation, respectively, were as follows: 126%, 132% and 101% in strain 385-cyp61/cyp61hph; 179%, 217% and 191% in strain 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo; 116%, 153% and 138% in strain cbs-cyp61hph and 100%, 141% and  <dig> % in strain av2-cyp61zeo .

expression analysis of the hmgr gene
in schizosaccharomyces pombe, cryptococcus neoformans and mammalian cells, the expression of the hmg-coa reductase encoding gene  is regulated by sterols
 <cit> . in x. dendrorhous, only one hmgr gene  has been identified, and its deduced amino acid sequence shares 58% identity and  <dig> % similarity with hmg <dig>  one of the two hmg-coa reductases in s. cerevisiae <cit> . thus, it is possible that the x. dendrorhous cyp61- mutants have a higher hmgr transcript level, which could explain the increase in carotenoid content. we quantified the hmgr mrna level by rt-qpcr at different timepoints on the growth curve of the seven analyzed strains. figure 
 <dig> shows the relative expression of this gene normalized to the housekeeping beta-actin gene
 <cit> . the hmgr gene expression pattern was different between the cyp61- mutants and their parental strains. while its expression is relatively constant in the wild-type strains, its expression in the 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo, cbs-cyp61hph and av2-cyp61zeo mutants increases along the growth curve, reaching expression levels almost  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times higher, respectively, than the wild-type strains after  <dig> h of cultivation. at  <dig> and  <dig> h of cultivation, the expression of this gene was between  <dig> and  <dig> times higher in the 385-cyp61hph/cyp61zeo, cbs-cyp61hph and av2-cyp61zeo strains than in the respective parental strains .

discussion
cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases are involved in the oxidative metabolism of an enormous diversity of substrates, taking part in primary, secondary and xenobiotic metabolism. cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are structurally and functionally conserved fungal p450s involved in membrane ergosterol biosynthesis
 <cit> , and the role of cyp <dig> as a c22-desaturase in fungal membrane sterol synthesis has been elucidated in s. cerevisiae <cit>  and candida glabrata <cit> . in this study, we isolated and characterized a gene, cyp <dig>  from x. dendrorhous that has nine exons, encodes a putative 526-residue polypeptide and shares significant similitude and identity with the c22-sterol desaturase from s. cerevisiae <cit> . we could predict several p <dig> characteristic secondary structural elements, and we identified three residues in cyp <dig> that are completely conserved in p450s. together, these observations support the hypothesis that the x. dendrohous cyp <dig> gene encodes the cytochrome p <dig> cyp <dig> 

as in other organisms
 <cit> , the cyp <dig> gene is not essential for the x. dendrorhous viability, even though we demonstrated that it is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. disruption of the cyp <dig> gene prevents ergosterol biosynthesis and leads to the accumulation of other intermediary sterols including ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol and ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol. contrary to our findings, the specific mutation of erg <dig> in s. cerevisiae results in the predominant accumulation of ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol, although the c22-desaturase substrate is ergosta- <dig> ,24-trien-3-ol
 <cit> . like in x. dendrohous, ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol accumulation has been observed in other fungi, such as c. neoformans, after the inhibition of the erg6-encoding enzyme
 <cit>  and in nystatin-resistant neurospora crassa strains that are unable to produce ergosterol
 <cit> . although our second found intermediary, ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol, is an atypical sterol, it has been detected in fungi strains that are unable to synthetize ergosterol that in turn are resistant to fungicidal polyenes, such as nystatin and primaricin; polyenes bind ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating channels that disrupt the transmembrane potential and its functions
 <cit> . this phenomenon was observed in a nystatin-resistant s. cerevisiae strain
 <cit>  and primaricin-resistant aspergillus nidulans strains
 <cit> . clearly, these observations and our results indicate the existence of alternative sterol biosynthesis pathways, which require further studies.

because the cyp61- mutant strains were viable without significant changes in their growth , ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol and/or ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol may play roles similar to ergosterol in the x. dendrorhous cell membrane. finally, even though the cyp61- mutant strains were not able to produce ergosterol, their sterol content was higher compared to the corresponding parental strains, suggesting an ergosterol-mediated feedback regulatory mechanism in the sterol biosynthesis pathway of x. dendrorhous.

in addition to the alterations in sterol content and composition, the cyp61- mutant x. dendrorhous strains exhibited color phenotypes dissimilar to their parental strains . carotenoid analyses revealed that the mutant strains produced more carotenoids , demonstrating that the cyp <dig> gene mutation affected carotenoid biosynthesis. major differences were observed after  <dig> and  <dig> h of culture, which coincide with the early and late stationary phases of growth . wozniak and co-workers reported that maximum expression levels of carotenogenic genes are reached by the end of the exponential and beginning of the stationary phase of x. dendrorhous growth
 <cit> , coinciding with the induction of carotenogenesis
 <cit> . it is expected that greater differences in the carotenoid content would be observed once carotenogenesis is induced.

similar to our results, other studies have demonstrated an increase in astaxanthin production in phaffia rhodozyma  when the ergosterol levels were reduced by fluconazole treatment
 <cit> . a possible explanation for the increased carotenoids in the cyp61- mutants could be the greater availability of carotenoid precursors in absence of the ergosterol negative feedback regulation. this reasoning is also supported by the fact that in the cyp61- mutants, the total sterol content was also increased. for example, supplementation of p. rhodozyma cultures with mva resulted in an increase in carotenoid production
 <cit> . likewise, deletion of the squalene synthase-encoding gene  in combination with the overexpression of the catalytic domain of hmgr in a recombinant c. utilis strain that produces carotenoids caused an increase of in lycopene biosynthesis
 <cit> .

ipp is the isoprenoid building block; in most eukaryotes, it is derived from the mva pathway
 <cit> . many of the regulatory aspects of isoprenoid biosynthesis involve elements of this pathway; the expression of hmgr  is a critical regulatory step
 <cit> . the alteration of hmgr expression in the x. dendrorhous cyp61- mutants could explain the increased carotenoid and sterol content. we quantified the hmgr transcript levels, and at all of the growth phases analyzed, it was greater than in the corresponding parental strain. similarly, an increase in the hmgr transcript level corresponded to an increase in the carotenoid content when the fungus blaskelea tripora was treated with ketoconazole, which is a specific ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor
 <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, hmg-coa reductase is encoded by two isogenes, hmg <dig> and hmg <dig>  and the expression of hmg <dig> is controlled at the transcriptional level by ergosterol
 <cit> . the overexpression of hmg <dig> combined with ketoconazole treatment in a s. cerevisiae recombinant strain resulted in an increase in beta-carotene production
 <cit> . finally, our results are similar to those reported in the astaxanthin over-producing x. dendrorhous mutant strain with lower ergosterol and a higher hmgr transcript level than the parental strain after  <dig> h of cultivation
 <cit> . however, the astaxanthin over-producing strain was obtained by random chemical mutagenesis, while we specifically blocked ergosterol biosynthesis by disrupting the cyp <dig> gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the cyp <dig> gene disruption in x. dendrorhous prevents the synthesis of ergosterol without affecting the growth of the yeast under the experimental conditions used in this work. the cyp61- mutant strains accumulate ergosta- <dig> ,22-trien-3-ol and ergosta- <dig> -dien-3-ol that may fulfill some of the ergosterol roles in the cell. in addition, our results strongly suggest that by a feedback regulatory mechanism, ergosterol regulates the synthesis of sterols and carotenoids in the astaxanthin-producing yeast x. dendrorhous, being the hmgr gene expression, one of its targets.
