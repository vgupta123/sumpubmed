BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cellular tissues are generally comprised of several cell types, many of which may be derived from a common pool of precursor cells. how such developmentally equivalent cells become distinct from one another remains a fundamental question in developmental biology. specification of cell fates involves the interpretation of multiple signalling pathways by individual cells. the developing eye of drosophila has been extensively used as a model system to determine how common signalling pathways can induce the generation of cellular diversity. in particular, specification of the r <dig> photoreceptor cell fate has been a principal paradigm for elucidation of how cell fates are established in response to signalling cues  <cit> .

the adult drosophila eye is comprised of approximately  <dig> ommatidia, with each ommatidium containing eight photoreceptor neurons surrounded by a collection of non-neuronal support cells  <cit> . the eye begins its development from the eye imaginal disc epithelium during mid-third larval instar, with the morphogenetic furrow progressing anteriorly across the disc, marking the onset of cell differentiation and pattern formation  <cit> . photoreceptor r <dig> is the first cell established in the eye, its recruitment mediated by signalling events coordinated by the furrow  <cit> . three pairs of photoreceptors, r2/ <dig>  r3/ <dig> and r1/ <dig>  are then subsequently recruited to each ommatidial cluster, their recruitment being dependent upon reiterative induction of the epidermal growth factor receptor  signalling pathway  <cit> . the last photoreceptor to be recruited is the r <dig> cell. addition of non-neuronal lens secreting cone cells, supporting pigment cells, and the generation of sensory bristle cells make up the full complement of ommatidial cells  <cit> .

induction of the r <dig> cell has been the most extensively studied cell differentiation event in the eye. with respect to common signalling events, the notch  signalling pathway and the receptor tyrosine kinases , egfr and sevenless , have been shown to be necessary for induction of the r <dig> fate  <cit> . loss of n signalling has been shown to cause the r <dig> precursor cell to adopt an r1/r <dig> cell fate. conversely, ectopic n activation in r1/ <dig> cells is sufficient to covert these cells into r <dig> cells  <cit> . the ability of n to potentiate r <dig> development is dependent on the expression of the n ligand, delta, in r1/ <dig> photoreceptors  <cit> . moreover, n may induce r <dig> fate differentiation in the presumptive r <dig> cell by both activating r7-cell-specific determinants, and repressing r <dig> cell determinants  <cit> . successive episodes of egfr activation of the ras/mapk  signalling cascade has been shown to be a requirement for recruitment of all photoreceptor neurons to the ommatidium, including the r <dig> cell  <cit> . in contrast, sev signalling is restricted to the presumptive r <dig> cell, with loss of sev signalling specifically resulting in the trans-determination of the presumptive r <dig> cell into a non-neuronal cone cell  <cit> . while sev and egfr both feed into the same signal transduction pathway, high levels of rtk activation in the presumptive r <dig> cell may be required to overcome repressive mechanisms specific to the r <dig> cell itself . in the presumptive r <dig> cell, high levels of rtk signalling result in the expression of a novel nuclear gene phyllopod   <cit> . phyl functions as an adaptor protein in the r <dig> nucleus, recruiting the neuronal inhibitor tramtrack  into a complex with seven in absentia  and ebi  <cit> . ttk rna is alternatively spliced, giving rise to two zinc-finger dna binding proteins, ttk <dig> and ttk <dig>  both ttk isoforms share a common n-terminal region containing a btb/poz  domain, but have alternative sets of cys2-his <dig> zinc-fingers in the carboxyl fragment, resulting in the two isoforms having different dna-binding specificities  <cit> . both ttk isoforms function to block neuronal fate specification in the third instar developing eye disc, and are presumed to be antagonists of rtk signalling, since overexpression of either isoform results in a failure of photoreceptor recruitment  <cit> . the recruitment of ttk <dig> into the sina-ebi complex in r <dig> precursor cells leads to ttk <dig> ubiquitination and post-translational degradation by proteolysis  <cit> . targeted degradation of ttk <dig> relieves the inhibition of the neuronal cell fate, allowing r <dig> fate specification to proceed. evidence suggests that ttk <dig> is also targeted for degradation through induction of rtk signalling  <cit> . additional studies have also implicated the rna-binding protein musashi  in the translational inhibition of ttk <dig> in r1/6/ <dig> precursor cells in the developing eye  <cit> . while ttk needs to be degraded for r <dig> fate specification to proceed, its presence is required for the formation of non-neuronal cone and pigment cells, highlighting the importance for tight regulatory control of cell-specific transcription factors in order to correctly specify cell fate within the developing eye disc  <cit> .

the r <dig> cell arises from a population of undifferentiated cells surrounding the already recruited five-cell neuronal pre-cluster of r8/2/5/3/ <dig> cells. these unspecified cells have undergone a second round of mitosis, an event required for re-population of the epithelium for the additional recruitment of the remaining photoreceptors, and non-neuronal supporting cells. the recruitment and differentiation of cells arising from the second mitotic wave requires the combinatorial inputs of n, egfr and sev signalling  <cit> . additionally, these cells require the expression of lozenge , a member of the runx family of transcription factors  <cit> . runx proteins are critical in development, since loss of runx protein function can lead to stomach cancer  <cit> , the development of acute myeloid leukemia  <cit>  or other severe developmental defects  <cit> .

in its role in eye development, lz has been described as a pre-patterning factor, since its expression within a pool of equipotent undifferentiated cells is required for the subsequent recruitment and differentiation of r1/ <dig> and r <dig> cells, cone and pigment cells  <cit> . in the absence of lz function, these cell types fail to correctly differentiate and excessive apoptosis in third-instar eye discs can be observed  <cit> . lz, in combination with other factors, is required to regulate a number of cell specific transcription factors expressed posterior to the second mitotic wave. for instance, lz acts in a combinatorial manner with yan, pointedp <dig> and suppressor of hairless ) to restrict d-pax2/shaven expression to the cone cell precursors in third instar eye discs  <cit> . the regulation of prospero  expression in r <dig> and cone cells is also dependent upon a combination of upstream transcription factors, including lz, pointed and yan  <cit> . lz has also been shown to negatively regulate seven-up in r <dig> and cone cells  <cit> , deadpan  expression in cone cells  <cit> , and bar expression in r <dig> and r <dig> cells  <cit> .

although studies have demonstrated the importance of lz in the specification of differentiated cell types in the eye disc after the second mitotic wave, lz gene regulation itself is not fully understood. while lz expression is initially activated in undifferentiated cells by sine oculis  and glass   <cit> , evidence suggests that lz expression levels are up-regulated in differentiating cell types  <cit> . there is also some evidence to suggest that the ras1/mapk signalling pathway blocks the up-regulation of lz expression in undifferentiated cells through repression by the yan protein  <cit> .

additional complexity to the regulation of lz gene expression is added by the findings that lz mrna is alternatively spliced during eye development, producing a full length isoform  and an isoform lacking exon v . exon v encodes a conserved ets interaction domain, and yeast two hybrid screens showed the direct interaction between lz and the ets factor pointedp <dig>  with this interaction removed upon site directed mutagenesis of ets interacting sequences within this exon  <cit> . exon v is critical for the development of presumptive r <dig> cells in the third instar eye disc, since r <dig> precursor cells can still develop in a severely truncated lz mutant with this exon intact.

in this study, we show that r <dig> development in third instar eye discs is dependent upon lz function, and that ttk <dig> may play a role in the direct or indirect repression of lz gene expression in cell types competent to develop as r <dig> cells. we show that loss of ttk <dig> function results in the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in third instar eye development. these ectopic r <dig> cells are dependent upon lz function for their development. conversely, overexpression of ttk <dig> results in loss of all lz-dependant differentiated cell types in the developing eye disc along with a marked decrease in lz expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated cell types. interestingly, by re-introducing lz into a developing eye where ttk <dig> is over-expressed, we could partially rescue cells expressing the lz-dependent factors bar, pros and cut. we could also partially rescue the expression of the r7-cell-specific marker klingon. together, these results suggest that the loss of cells in the ttk <dig> over-expressing lines was largely due to the removal of lz function.

additionally, we show that sina and msi, factors upstream of ttk <dig> in eye development, play a ttk-dependent role in lz gene regulation in r <dig> precursor cells. the elucidation of the function of ttk <dig> in lz gene repression in a subset of cells provides a possible mechanism for the tight control of lz expression required for the correct differentiation of cell types during early eye development.

RESULTS
lozenge mutations suppress tramtrack loss of function eye phenotypes
lz has been shown to regulate a number of cell specific transcription factors expressed after the second mitotic wave in the developing eye  <cit>  however, the regulation of lz itself is not fully understood. lz expression is initially activated in undifferentiated cells by so and gl  <cit> , and evidence also suggest that the ets factor yan prevents up-regulation of lz expression in undifferentiated cells  <cit> . so, gl and yan binding sites are all present in the lz eye-specific enhancer region, a critical functional region required for the correct expression of lz in the developing eye, located in the second intron of the lz gene . we conducted a multiple sequence comparison of this region across three drosophila species, d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura and d. erecta, and found that binding sites for gl  <cit> , so  <cit>  and the ets factors yan and pointedp <dig>  <cit>  are conserved across these drosophila species . two other ets binding sites have been identified in a second region of the eye enhancer and have been previously shown to be conserved in d. simulans, d. melanogaster and d. erecta  <cit> . additionally, we identified four conserved putative ttk <dig> core binding sites , suggesting that ttk <dig> is a likely candidate to regulate lz gene expression in drosophila eye development.

to explore the genetic relationship between ttk and lz, the adult eye was used to investigate phenotypic interactions between lz mutants and mutations in candidate regulatory genes. ttk loss of function mutant clones were generated in a lzmr <dig> hemizygote male mutant background, and the resultant eye phenotype was examined for phenotypic enhancement or suppression. the lzmr <dig> mutation is caused by a p-element insertion in the 5' untranslated region of the gene  <cit>  and adult males of this genotype exhibit minor ommatidial defects at the posterior rim of the eye, making this mutant amenable for a genetic interaction screen . using an allele known to result in the specific loss of ttk <dig> but not ttk <dig> , and an allele known to result in the loss of both ttk <dig> and ttk <dig> , ttk- clones were generated by mitotic recombination using the flp/frt system  <cit>  with the flp recombinase placed under the control of the eyeless eye enhancer  <cit> . additionally, a cell lethal mutation  was also introduced into the system, resulting in the death of the twin-spot cells homozygous for the 3r <dig>  mutation, but not the ttk- mutation. this leaves only ttk- homozygous cells and non-recombinant heterozygous cells. as a result, ttk- clones occupied the majority of the eye  <cit> . scanning electron microscopy revealed that loss of ttk <dig> function, or both ttk <dig> and ttk <dig>  in the eye resulted in severe degeneration of the corneal lens, with ommatidia and sensory bristles failing to properly develop . these results were consistent with those previously described  <cit> . following the generation of large patches of ttkrm <dig> or ttk1e <dig> mutant clones in lzmr <dig> hemizygote males, we observed the rescue of ttk- mutant eye phenotypes . in lzmr2;ttk- double mutant tissue, ommatidial structure was present and the eye appeared less scarred. furthermore, sensory bristles developed in the double mutants , whereas they were absent in the ttk- mutant tissue . these results show that lz mutations can partially suppress the severe eye phenotypes of ttk loss of function mutants, suggesting that lz functions downstream of, or in parallel to, ttk in the developing eye.

loss of ttk <dig> function alone is sufficient to cause development of ectopic presumptive r <dig> cells early in development
loss of ttk <dig> function has been shown to result in the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in the adult retina  <cit> . however, another study analysed expression of the neuronal marker elav in ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant clones earlier in development and found that ectopic photoreceptors never developed in third instar larval ommatidial clones  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether ectopic presumptive r <dig> cells could be detected in ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant clones generated by the eyflp/frt method in third instar eye discs by using alternative r <dig> cell markers.

runt protein expression can normally be detected in r <dig> and r <dig> cells in the developing eye  <cit> . a projected confocal image of runt labelled wild-type eye discs show a single r <dig> cell per ommatidia just posterior to the furrow . seven rows posterior to the furrow, when r <dig> cells are normally recruited to ommatidial clusters, runt positive r <dig> and r <dig> cells can be observed . confocal imaging of runt labelled ttk mutant discs showed that r <dig> cells are recruited normally in both ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant clones. however, ectopic r <dig> cells were observed from approximately the seventh row posterior to the furrow in both ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant ommatidia . we found that  <dig> %  of ttk1e <dig> mutant ommatidia contained between 2- <dig> runt-labelled presumptive r <dig> cells in the apical r <dig> focal plane approximately seven rows posterior to the furrow in the disc epithelium, while  <dig> % of ttkrm <dig> mutant ommatidia also exhibited this phenotype . ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> clones were easily characterised by a lack of β-galactosidase staining in the early eye disc, and mutant clones constituted the majority of the eye disc, a result consistent with the large areas of w- clonal patches observed in the adult eye .

to further confirm the identity of these ectopic runt labelled cells in ttk- mutant ommatidia, analysis of ttk loss of function mutant clones with the presumptive r <dig> cell pros was also undertaken. pros protein expression can normally be detected in r <dig> and cone cells in the third instar developing eye epithelium  <cit> . pros is expressed at higher levels in the r <dig> precursor cell than the cone cells at this stage  <cit> , with these cell types being located at distinct depths  in the developing eye disc, the cone cells being the most apical  <cit> . confocal imaging showed the presence of ectopic pros labelled presumptive r <dig> cells in both ttkrm <dig> and ttk1e <dig> mutant ommatidia . high magnification images of the mutant disc showed the presence of at least two labelled cells in some ommatidia in the r <dig> cell focal plane , compared to a single cell in the same plane of a wild-type disc . normally, the four pros labelled cone cells are evident in a focal plane above r <dig>  as originally described by tomlinson and ready  <cit> . pros labelled cone cells were also present in ttk- mutant clones . however, less than the normal complement of cone cells was often observed in both ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant ommatidia, suggesting a trans-determination of non-neuronal cone cells into presumptive r <dig> cells in the absence of ttk function. taken together, both runt and pros labelling of ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant eye discs showed the presence of ectopic presumptive r <dig> cells in the early developing eye of mutant ommatidia lacking ttk <dig> function alone, or lacking both ttk <dig> and ttk <dig> function.

since ectopic presumptive r <dig> cells were observed in the larval disc epithelia of ttk- mutant clones, we next analysed whether these ectopic r <dig> cells also expressed lz. therefore, ttkrm <dig> and ttk1e <dig> clones were generated in a lz enhancer trap line  background. lzgal <dig> flies contain a p-gawb insertion in the 5' untranslated region of the gene and thus the yeast gal <dig> transcriptional activator is expressed under the control of lz enhancer elements  <cit> . the eye phenotype of lzgal <dig> uas-gfp flies is normal, and the enhancer trap has been shown to faithfully report the expression of lz in the developing eye, with the expression pattern comparable to lz protein expression  <cit> .

lz-driven gfp expression is normally detected in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow . analysis of lz-driven gfp expression in ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant undifferentiated cells revealed no visible alteration to the levels of gfp expression, or the numbers of gfp-expressing cells . as cells begin their differentiation process, lz-driven gfp expression can be detected in r <dig>  and r <dig> photoreceptors , and in cone cells . in both ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant clones, photoreceptors r <dig> and r <dig> cells developed normally and also expressed lz-driven gfp . r <dig> and r <dig> cells were identified by the co-localisation of lz-driven gfp with the neuronal marker elav, and by their position in the ommatidia. additionally, bar expression was analysed in ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> clonal patches in an eyeless gal4;uas-flp;frt82b-ubigfp  background . bar specifically labels r <dig> and r <dig> cells in the developing eye  <cit> . in all negatively marked ttk- mutant clonal patches analysed, no loss of bar expressing cells, or ectopic bar expression, was ever observed. taken together, the early development of presumptive r <dig> and r <dig> cells in third instar disc epithelia is not perturbed by the loss of ttk <dig> function.

analysis of ttk1e <dig> and ttkrm <dig> mutant ommatidia with the presumptive r <dig> cell marker runt showed that ectopic r <dig> cells present in the mutant disc epithelia also expressed lz-driven gfp . additional labelling of mutant ommatidial clones with pros revealed the presence of more than one lz-expressing r <dig> cell in the r <dig> cell focal plane . gfp-expressing cone cells do develop in ttk- ommatidia, although these cells are disorganised and often the incorrect complement of cone cells  was observed . these results reveal that the removal of ttk <dig> function alone is sufficient to induce the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in the developing eye which also continue to express lz. interestingly, while the presumptive r <dig> markers runt and pros clearly show the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in eye discs lacking ttk <dig> function, analysis with the neuronal marker elav did not reveal the presence of ectopic elav-expressing cells in ttk- mutant ommatidia . this suggests that the ectopic presumptive r <dig> cells are arising from cells of the non-neuronal cell lineage, which is consistent with previously published reports  <cit> .

the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in ttk1e <dig> mutants is dependent upon lz function
we next set out to determine whether lz function is essential for the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in mutants lacking ttk <dig> function. to address this, ttk1e <dig> clones were generated in a lzmr <dig> loss of function mutant background and the recruitment of r <dig> precursor cells was monitored using the runt antibody. the lzmr <dig> mutation is caused by a lesion in the eye specific enhancer region of the lz gene, and the levels of lz transcript produced in this mutant are at less than 10% of those produced in wild-type flies  <cit> , resulting in the absence of the development of lz-dependent cell types. results showed that after the removal of lz function in the absence of ttk <dig> function, r <dig> cells failed to develop in the early developing eye . these results indicate the lz is absolutely required for r <dig> cell development and suggest that lz may function downstream of ttk <dig> in this context.

overexpression of ttk <dig> results in the down-regulation of lz and the subsequent loss of lz-dependent cell types in the developing eye
our results have demonstrated that removal of ttk <dig> function results in the development of ectopic r <dig> cells at the third instar developmental stage. these ectopic cells express lz-driven gfp, and are also dependent upon lz function for their development. it is possible that ttk <dig> may function to regulate lz expression levels in early eye development to prevent the ectopic development of r <dig> cells. alternatively, these ectopic r <dig> cells may simply continue to express lz because they are derived from the r <dig> equivalence group. we therefore examined whether ttk <dig> has the ability to repress lz gene expression in the developing eye. first we over-expressed ttk <dig> in lz-expressing cells by crossing lzgal <dig> into a uas-ttk <dig> background and analysed the expression of lz-driven gfp along with the expression of specific presumptive cell fate markers. lzgal4;uas-ttk <dig> adult eyes exhibited severely disrupted eyes that lacked ommatidial structure and also exhibited severe scarring . this adult phenotype alone suggests that overexpression of ttk <dig> in lz-expressing cells is enough to prevent the correct development of these cells.

further analysis of lz-driven gfp in disc epithelia of lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp;uas-ttk <dig> third instar larvae was undertaken. single planar confocal images of undifferentiated cells in the lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp;uas-ttk <dig> mutant disc epithelia showed that although less cells were present in this focal plane than in control discs , the levels of lz-driven gfp expression did not appear to be reduced upon overexpression of ttk <dig> 

in neuronal and non-neuronal differentiating cells, specific antibodies were used in conjunction with the lz enhancer trap line to mark each cell type. photoreceptors r <dig> and r <dig> were identified using an antibody against the bar antigen . our results showed that bar expression was lost in the lzgal, uas-gfp;uas-ttk <dig> disc epithelium , and lz-driven gfp expression was severely depleted in the r <dig> and r <dig> cell plane.

to analyse r <dig> and cone cell development in the lzgal, uas-gfp;uas-ttk <dig> third instar disc epithelium, pros was used in conjuction with the lz enhancer trap line to specifically mark these cells . in the ttk <dig> overexpression line, high magnification confocal imaging revealed few pros and lz-driven gfp labelled r <dig> and cone cells in the developing third instar eye discs . the depletion of other cell specific markers such as runt in r <dig> cells and cut in cone cells was also observed . since both pros and bar are, in part, regulated by lz, these results support the hypothesis that ttk <dig> can repress lz gene expression in the developing eye.

a caveat to the above described experiment is that the system utilises the lzgal <dig> enhancer to simultaneously monitor uas-gfp expression and drive uas-ttk <dig>  when ttk <dig>  in turn, could then act to repress the lz enhancer element and no longer drive the uas-ttk <dig> transgene. this experiment is therefore dependent upon the relative stability of ttk <dig> in the third instar disc epithelium. while we did observe a perturbation to the development of differentiated lz-expressing cell types, it remains possible that lz-driven gfp expression was produced initially in undifferentiated cells before ttk <dig> could be produced at high enough levels to repress lz. we therefore obtained a lz antibody and examined lz protein expression in discs where a gal <dig> driver under the control of the glass multimer repeat  promoter was used to drive the uas-ttk <dig> transgene in all cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow in developing eye discs  <cit> .

in control  eye discs, a projected confocal image of all cells in the basal undifferentiated cell plane reveal that lz is expressed in most, if not all, undifferentiated cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow . upon ttk <dig> overexpression, a marked reduction in the number of lz expressing cells, and the levels of lz expression, in the undifferentiated cell plane was observed . interestingly, lz appeared to be expressed in a number of undifferentiated cells just posterior to the furrow, then expression decreased in the middle and posterior portions of the disc. this could simply reflect a delay in the onset of ttk <dig> overexpression by the gmr-gal <dig> transgene. alternatively, ttk <dig> could repress lz expression in specific pools of undifferentiated precursor cells. high magnification images of the middle disc region revealed that most, if not all, undifferentiated cells in control discs stained with the dna marker 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  also expressed lz . in contrast, overexpression of ttk <dig> in undifferentiated cells did not cause a reduction in the number of dapi-stained cells , but a clear reduction of lz expression was observed .

in the differentiated region of the control disc epithelia, lz expression was observed in r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and cone cells . this is consistent with the published expression pattern of lz  <cit> , additionally, we confirmed lz antibody specificity by staining lz null mutant disc epithelia with the antibody and observed no lz expression . a reduction of lz expression was observed in differentiated cells of disc epithelia where ttk <dig> was over-expressed . very few cells expressing both elav and lz were ever observed in these developing eye discs, and few cone cells in the apical cell plane expressed lz. taken together, these results show that ttk <dig> can repress lz expression in the developing eye.

loss of lz-dependent cells in ttk <dig> overexpression flies can be rescued by expressing a gmr-lz transgene lacking lz regulatory regions
our results have shown that ttk <dig> overexpression leads to repression of lz expression, which in turn results in the loss of lz-dependent differentiating cell types in third instar eye disc epithelia. we next tested whether overexpression of lz could rescue the loss of lz-dependent cells types observed from ttk <dig> overexpression in developing eye discs. for this experiment, a gmr-lz transgene containing the full length lz  <dig>  kb cdna under the control of the gmr promoter, but lacking the lz eye specific enhancer and upstream promoter regions  <cit> , was crossed into the gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> mutant background, and eye discs were analysed for the rescue of photoreceptors r <dig> , <dig> and cone cells. by itself, the gmr-lz c <dig>  transgene  causes ectopic development of the presumptive r <dig> cell and a mild disorganisation of developing ommatidia , indicating that high levels of lz expression can indeed promote the r <dig> cell fate early in drosophila development.

gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> adult eyes are severely perturbed, being devoid of any ommatidial structure . furthermore, elav labelling of third instar gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> eye discs showed that most neuronal cells failed to differentiate , which is not surprising given that ttk <dig> is a general repressor of the neuronal cell fate  <cit> . we first used the bar antibody to determine whether lz-dependent r <dig> and r <dig> cells could be rescued in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz eye disc epithelia. in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> eye discs, few bar labelled cells were observed, with only  <dig> %  of ommatidia exhibiting at least one bar positive cell . overexpression of lz in the absence of the eye specific enhancer could partially alleviate this defect, with 32% of ommatidia  showing the presence of at least one bar positive cell .

to determine whether r <dig> cells could be rescued in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz, the r7-specific enhancer trap line b38-lacz was recombined with the gmr-lz transgene and crossed into the gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> background. the b38-lacz line is an enhancer trap insertion in klingon  and is strongly expressed in r <dig> cells but only weakly expressed in other surrounding photoreceptors . the use of an anti-β-galactosidase antibody to detect enhancer trap activity showed the depletion of r <dig> cells in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> eye discs, with as few as  <dig> % of ommatidia  ever showing the presence of a β-galactosidase positive cell . however, in gmr -gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz, many more β-galactosidase positive r <dig> cells  were observed in the developing ommatidia .

non-neuronal cone cells can normally be detected with the cut antibody . while few cut labelled cone cells were observed in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> developing eye discs , a proportion of cut labelled cone cells were rescued in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz discs , although no ommatidia with the full complement of cone cells were ever observed. due to the disorganisation of these cells, absolute numbers could not be obtained.

because pros is positively regulated by lz  <cit> , we asked whether pros expression could also be rescued in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz discs. few pros labelled cells were ever observed in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk <dig> eye discs . however, in gmr-gal4;uas-ttk69/gmr-lz discs, a significant increase in pros expression was observed, particularly in the r <dig> cell plane . taken together, these results strongly suggest that some of the cellular phenotypes observed upon ttk <dig> overexpression in third instar developing eye disc are at least partially due to changes in lz expression, since the simultaneous overexpression of lz and ttk <dig> leads to rescue of r <dig> , <dig> photoreceptors and non-neuronal cone cells, all of which are dependent upon lz for fate specification. furthermore, because the gmr-lz transgene lacks lz regulatory regions, these results suggest that the regulation of lz by ttk <dig> could potentially occur via the lz-eye enhancer region.

sina and msi function as negative regulators of ttk in r1/6/ <dig> cells in early eye development
the normal specification of the presumptive r <dig> cell is prevented in sina loss of function mutants due to failure of ttk <dig>  and presumably ttk <dig>  degradation  <cit> . however the expression pattern of sina in r <dig> , <dig>  and r <dig> cells  <cit>  initiated the investigation of the function of sina in these other cell types. genetic experiments have suggested that the rna-binding protein msi functions redundantly with sina to down-regulate ttk <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig> cells in larval eye development  <cit> . in their experiments, hirota and colleagues showed the loss of r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptors in sina msi double loss of function mutants, while all cells were recruited properly in msi null mutant developing ommatidia  <cit> . furthermore, 30% of retinal sections from adult ommatidia of sina msi double mutants in a ttkosn heterozygous mutant background, a mutation that disrupts both ttk <dig> and ttk <dig> protein expression, exhibited the correct number of photoreceptor neurons, consistent with the hypothesis of negative regulation of ttk by both sina and msi.

to further examine the relationship between sina, msi, ttk <dig> and lz gene regulation, we examined lz gene expression in r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptor cells of sina loss of function mutant eye discs, and of sina msi double loss of function mutants using the lzgal <dig> enhancer trap line to drive gfp expression. labelling of sina null mutant eye discs with the r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptor marker bar demonstrated that  <dig> % of ommatidia contained two lz-expressing bar positive cells . however some ommatidia contained less than two bar positive cells, indicating that sina may play a minor role in the cell fate determination of r <dig> and r <dig> cells . in sina msi double mutant eye discs very few lz-expressing bar positive r <dig> and r <dig> cells were observed . analysis of r7-cell development in mutant eye discs with the presumptive r <dig> cell marker runt showed that very few r <dig> cells are recruited to developing ommatitida in sina mutants , and in sina msi double mutants . the possibility remains that fewer cells were recruited to differentiating ommatidia because fewer cells were available from the pool of undifferentiated cells.

to determine whether the mutant defects observed in sina msi double mutants could be attributed to failure of ttk degradation in early eye development, we expressed a uas-ttkrnai line under the control of the lzgal <dig> driver in a sina msi double mutant background. expression of the uas-ttkrnai transgene would result in the knockdown of both ttk isoforms based upon the reported targeted ttk sequence .

in lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp; uas-ttkrnai; sina-msi- eye discs, we observed a significant rescue of bar and lz-expressing r <dig> and r <dig> cells . at least one bar positive cell was observed in  <dig> % of ommatidia , with the majority of ommatidia containing two bar positive cells. the eye disc did appear disorganised and occasionally r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptor cells were observed in an incorrect orientation . additionally, the recruitment of r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptors appeared to be delayed , with bar positive cells not appearing until at least the 12th ommatidial row posterior to the furrow, when normally bar positive cells can be observed approximately  <dig> rows posterior to the furrow .

analysis of r7-cell development in lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp; uas-ttkrnai; sina-msi- eye discs using runt as a marker revealed the development of ectopic, lz-expressing r <dig> cells in most developing ommatidia , a phenotype already attributable to the loss of ttk <dig> function in eye development . taken together, these results confirm that the loss of r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> cells in sina msi double mutants can be largely attributed to the failure of ttk degradation, and show conclusively that sina and msi function redundantly to regulate ttk expression in r <dig> and r <dig> cells. furthermore, the rescue of lz expression in all lz-dependent cells adds extra weight to the hypothesis that lz can be negatively regulated by ttk <dig> in the developing eye, either directly or indirectly.

discussion
the drosophila ttk <dig> transcriptional repressor has previously been shown to play a critical role in a number of developmental processes, including specification of glia in the embryonic cns  <cit> , photoreceptor differentiation in the eye  <cit> , and dorsal follicle cell migration and chorion production in the ovary  <cit> . these developmental roles for ttk <dig> have been shown to be dependent upon the repressive activity of ttk <dig>  here, we have established an interaction between ttk <dig> and lz mutant alleles and have shown that ttk <dig> can repress lz expression in the third instar developing eye disc. furthermore, we have shown that the development of ectopic r <dig> cells in ttk loss of function mutants is dependent upon the function of lz. our results have led us to conclude that ttk <dig> may repress lz in a subset of precursor cells competent to develop as r <dig> cells. one important finding from our studies was that upon overexpression of ttk <dig>  lz protein expression was observed in a wave of cells posterior to the furrow prior to its reduction in basally located undifferentiated cells in the posterior portion of the disc . this result could reflect a delay in the onset of producing ttk <dig> at levels required to repress lz expression, or alternatively, it could highlight the ability of ttk <dig> to repress lz in a subset of cells in early eye development.

loss of ttk <dig> expression in third instar eye epithelia resulted in development of ectopic lz-expressing presumptive r <dig> cells, revealing that only precursor cells competent to develop as r7's were affected by the loss of ttk <dig> function. overexpression of ttk <dig> caused severe reduction of lz expression in all lz-dependent differentiating cell types as measured by the lzgal <dig> driven expression of gfp, while re-introduction of the gmr-lz transgene resulted in the significant rescue of 69% of lz-dependent r <dig> cells. interestingly, only 32% of r <dig> or r <dig> cells could be rescued, suggesting that genes, other than lz, are necessary for development of these cells and were affected by ttk <dig> overexpression in the developing eye. additionally, lz protein expression was down-regulated upon overexpression of ttk <dig> in both undifferentiated and differentiated cell types. taken together, we hypothesise that ttk <dig> repression of lz in eye development functions in a set of cells to control the specificity and level of lz gene expression in order to correctly specify the r <dig> cell.

further support for our hypothesis comes from analysis of sina and msi mutants. sina has been proposed to negatively regulate both ttk isoforms in drosophila eye development  <cit> . additionally, msi has been shown to translationally repress ttk <dig> mrna in developing sensory organ precursor cells of the neuroectoderm, with mutations in msi resulting in bristle duplication forming from the one socket  <cit> . with respect to eye development, hirota and colleagues  <cit>  proposed that sina and msi could function redundantly in presumptive r <dig> and r <dig> cells to negatively regulate ttk <dig> expression. our findings have supported this model, with knockdown of ttk expression in a sina msi double mutant background resulting in the rescue of the majority of r <dig> and r <dig> cells. the recovery of only 73% of presumptive r <dig> and r <dig> cells in lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp; uas-ttkrnai; sina-msi- eye discs could be due to a failure of full knockdown of the ttk gene product by expressing the rnai transgene, or due to a secondary but as yet uncharacterised role for sina in r <dig> and r <dig> photoreceptor development. importantly, ectopic lz-expressing r <dig> cells were observed in almost all of lzgal <dig>  uas-gfp; uas-ttkrnai; sina-msi- mutant ommatidia, demonstrating the significance of the inhibitory effect of ttk in r <dig> cell regulation.

ttk <dig> is a downstream target of ras1/mapk signalling, and ttk isoforms are targeted for degradation upon induction of this signalling cascade  <cit> . our conclusion that ttk <dig> negatively regulates lz gene expression implies that induction of the ras1/mapk signalling cascade leads to the de-repression of lz due to degradation of the ttk protein. although initial reports suggested that lz was not a downstream target of the ras <dig> signalling pathway  <cit> , a more recent study from our laboratories have shown a genetic interaction between ras <dig> and lz alleles  <cit> . this latter study showed that the mild rough eye phenotype caused by expression of a dominant negative ras <dig> allele from the sev promoter  could be enhanced in flies where half the dose of lz was removed. additionally, expression of a constitutively active ras <dig> allele under the control of sev  could partially rescue adult eye defects observed in lz temperature sensitive mutants  <cit> . the study further demonstrated that yan, an inhibitor of rtk signalling in the drosophila eye  <cit> , can negatively regulate lz in a subset of cells in early eye development, with the conclusion being that yan represses lz expression in undifferentiated cells, and as cells differentiate, lz expression increases due to the removal of yan's influence on lz repression  <cit> . interestingly, this repression also appears to occur in precursor cells competent to develop as r <dig> cells, with loss of yan function causing the conversion of mystery cells to ectopic, lz-expressing r <dig> cells  <cit> . the co-operative action of yan and ttk <dig> in repressing r <dig> photoreceptor cell fate has previously been reported  <cit> , as the loss of yan function in the developing eye results in the development of ectopic r <dig> cells, and this phenotype can be dominantly enhanced by the reduction of ttk <dig> function  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that yan and ttk <dig> play redundant or synergistic roles in lz gene repression in undifferentiated cells of the eye .

ttk <dig> normally exerts its repressive effects by direct binding to core sites in promoter regions of target genes. for example, ttk <dig> can compete with pointedp <dig> for binding the string promoter, thus playing a part in regulating the second mitotic wave in eye morphogenesis  <cit> . functional binding sites have also been identified in other ttk <dig> target genes, including tailless  <cit> , fushi tarazu  <cit> , and even skipped  <cit> . in our study, we have identified putative core ttk <dig> binding sites in the lz eye enhancer region, and these binding sites are conserved across three drosophila species. the lz eye enhancer has been shown to be essential for mediating the regulation of lz expression in the eye, in particular, providing a molecular target for activation of lz expression in undifferentiated cells posterior to the furrow by two proteins, so and gl  <cit> . interestingly, so and gl binding sites are also highly conserved across different drosophila species, and are present in the same enhancer region as the ttk <dig> sites. in addition, an ets  binding site is also highly conserved in this region. our previous studies have indicated that yan represses lz in eye development  <cit> , and another study has shown that pntp <dig> and ttk <dig> can compete for direct binding to the string promoter  <cit> . while we have not in this study demonstrated the direct binding of ttk <dig> to the lz eye enhancer region, it remains plausible that the repression of lz by ttk <dig> is direct.

in addition to its expression in undifferentiated cells, ttk <dig> is also expressed in cone cells in the third instar eye epithelia, and in photoreceptor cells later in pupal development  <cit> . this pattern of expression correlates with its function, since ttk <dig> is known to repress the neuronal fate but promote non-neuronal fate induction in third instar eye development  <cit> , while ttk <dig> plays a positive role in photoreceptor development in pupal eye development  <cit> . however, the developmental role of ttk <dig> in this context is likely to depend on the levels of ttk <dig> expression. for example, while ttk <dig> is thought to induce non-neuronal cell fates, we and others have shown that high levels of ttk <dig> expression driven from either the sev-gal <dig> driver, or the gmr-gal <dig> driver, can inhibit both photoreceptor development and cone cell development . importantly, ttk <dig> is not normally degraded in presumptive cone cells, yet lz expression persists in these cells, highlighting that appropriate levels of transcription factors are critical in defining the combinations of genes expressed in particular cell types. it is possible that a low titre of ttk <dig> in cone cells can partially repress expression of lz, thus differentiating them from presumptive r <dig> cells. indeed, r <dig> and cone cells arise from a developmentally equipotent group of cells known as the r <dig> equivalence group, and therefore subtle changes within this group of cells are necessary to mediate the correct fate outcomes  <cit> . alternatively, ttk <dig> binding partners may be absent in cone cells, therefore impeding the ability of ttk <dig> to exert it repressive effect. whatever the case, the mechanism by which ttk <dig> can promote the differentiation of some cell types, yet inhibit others is currently unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
cell fate induction in the developing eye is dependant upon the expression of unique sets of transcription factors in a spatial and temporal manner  <cit> . lz plays an important role as a pre-patterning factor in early eye development, since its expression in undifferentiated cells is necessary for the recruitment and subsequent differentiation of neuronal r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> cells, and non-neuronal cone and pigment cells. furthermore, lz acts in combinatorial manner with a number of factors, in a cell specific manner, to transcriptionally activate, or repress, transcription factors expressed after the second mitotic wave  <cit> . it is therefore critical that lz itself is tightly regulated in differentiating cells. this regulatory constriction must extend to the level of lz expression, since expression levels of a gene can greatly influence the specification of individual cell types. for example, functional analysis of the cell fate specification gene seven-up in the developing eye epithelia revealed that if ectopic expression levels of svp are low in r <dig> and cone cell precursors, cone cells will be converted to r <dig> cells, whereas if levels are too high, r <dig> and cone cells will adopt an outer photoreceptor fate  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising to consider that ttk <dig> may, in part, regulate the levels of lz expression in a specific pool of equipotent cells to allow for the correct fate specification of cells specified after the second mitotic wave.

lz is a member of the runx family of transcription factors, and these highly conserved proteins play key roles in the regulation of a number of developmental processes such as epithelial development, hematopoesis and neurogenesis in mammals  <cit>  and in eye development and hematopoesis in flies  <cit> . similarities between mammalian runx and drosophila lz proteins extend to the level of gene regulation and protein-protein interaction, with both runx <dig> and lz being alternatively spliced to remove an ets interaction domain, and both proteins having the ability to physically interact with the ets- <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . tramtrack <dig> is a member of the btb/pozf family of transcription factors, a diverse group of proteins functioning in many biological processes, including cell cycle progression, b cell fate determination and hematopoietic stem cell fate determination  <cit> . the human genome encodes approximately  <dig> pozf proteins  <cit> , with at least one of these proteins having been demonstrated to be involved in antagonising runx activity in t cell fate specification  <cit> . therefore, the elucidation of mechanisms and factors involved in lz regulation in drosophila will greatly enhance our understanding of runx regulation in key mammalian developmental processes.
