BACKGROUND
the megencephaly balb/cbyj-kv <dig> mceph/mceph mice ,  <cit>  show dramatic and progressive increase in brain size  <cit>  after birth. the phenotype results from an  <dig> base-pair deletion in the gene encoding the shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel subunit kv <dig>   <cit> . kv <dig>  is expressed in axons and dendrites of neurons and forms tetramers with other kv <dig> subunits creating channels that regulate neuronal excitability and nerve signaling. the mceph/mceph mice express a truncated kv <dig>  protein in the endoplasmatic reticulum , mceph, consisting of  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids. mceph has a dominant negative effect on kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  currents when overexpressing mceph in xenopus oocytes. however, in brain, no er-retention of kv <dig>  was seen probably due to rapid mceph degradation and low mceph levels  <cit> . mceph/mceph mice behave normally at birth but from postnatal week  <dig> they begin to display progressive motor disturbances and typical behavior of complex partial seizures. the progressive brain overgrowth is significant at  <dig> weeks of age and affects primarily hippocampus and ventral cortex, whereas thalamus, olfactory bulb and cerebellum have normal size  <cit> . the enlarged areas have marked disturbances in expression of signaling components of brain derived neurotrophic factor , insulin like growth factor  system, and several neuropeptides  <cit> . the hippocampal enlargement appears to result from both more and larger neurons and astrocytes  <cit> . balb/cbyj mice heterozygous for the mceph mutation appear to behave normally but their brain has not been studied.

the link between this kv <dig>  truncation and brain overgrowth is not yet fully understood.

to establish if lack of functional kv <dig>  or the presence of the malfunctioning and truncated protein itself is the reason for the brain enlargement in mceph/mceph, we studied and compared hippocampus and ventral brain size using mri in  animals with a complete lack of kv <dig>  ,  animals that were lacking kv <dig>  in one allele but carried a functional kv <dig>  on the other allele ,  animals that had the truncating deletion in kv <dig>  in both  or only one allele . the wild type littermates of kv <dig>  null and mceph/mceph animals served as control groups. the mceph alleles and kv <dig>  null alleles were on genetic backgrounds of 100% and 94% balb/cbyj, respectively. while the mceph mutation originated on balb/cbyj, kv <dig>  null alleles were transferred through breeding from a c3heb/fej background onto the background of theoretically 94% balb/cbyj and 6% c3heb/fej.

RESULTS
to elucidate whether knock-out of kv <dig>  can cause brain overgrowth as seen in the kv <dig>  truncated mceph/mceph mice, we first minimized the genomic variability between balb/cbyj-kv <dig> mceph/mceph and c3heb/fej-kv <dig>  null mice by generating a semicongenic balb.c3heb-kv <dig> -/- strain . brains from both mceph/mceph and kv <dig>  null mice as well as heterozygous and wild type littermates were then investigated for size of hippocampus and ventral cortex using 3d-mri. for the hippocampus volume, 3d image files were used to manually segment the region and create a three dimensional view . examples of segmentation in all three orthogonal planes are shown in figure  <dig>  the ventral cortex was measured as depicted in figure  <dig> . intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for the measurements of ventral cortex and hippocampus were in the range of r =  <dig> – <dig> .

both pure balb/cbyj wild type and semicongenic wild type  littermates were used as controls. the mice of these two control groups were very similar, that is no significant difference was observed in hippocampus volume  or ventral cortex volume  between these two groups . comparing mceph/mceph mice with age-matched balb/cbyj wild type mice showed that mceph/mceph mice had a 66% larger hippocampus  and a 37% larger ventral cortex . eleven of the  <dig> mceph/mceph brains had a hippocampal volume and a ventral cortex volume greater than any wild type littermate. likewise,  <dig> of the  <dig> mceph/mceph animals had hippocampus and ventral cortex enlargement above the 98th percentile of the wild type mice . similarly to mceph/mceph, several of the kv <dig>  null brains showed a clearly enlarged hippocampus and ventral cortex. however, enlargement was found in a smaller percentage in kv <dig>  null than in mceph/mceph mice . nevertheless, we could demonstrate that the lack of kv <dig>  can result in an enlargement of both hippocampus and ventral cortex . of the  <dig> analyzed kv <dig>  null brains,  <dig> had a hippocampal volume above, and  <dig> of these  <dig> had a ventral cortex volume above the 98th percentile of wild type mice . kv <dig>  null heterozygotes, carrying only one kv <dig>  allele, showed no significant enlargement of hippocampus  or ventral cortex . similarly, the  <dig> mceph heterozygotes showed a hippocampus volume  or ventral cortex volume  comparable to their wild type littermates . the hippocampal volume and the ventral cortex volume correlated very well for the mceph/mceph and the kv <dig>  null mice  .

behavior and appearance of the kv <dig>  null mice were similar to that of the mceph/mceph mice and markedly different from that of the wild type littermates. the phenotypes include body tremor, a hyperstartle response, jittering, forelimb paddling and cramps, a sitting posture, audio sensitivity, porphyria, as well as inflammation and crusting of eye lid and the outer ear. these pathologic signs were present in all mceph/mceph and all kv <dig>  null mice, but not in heterozygous or wild type mouse. kv <dig>  mice had a milder epileptic behavior than mceph/mceph mice. nine of  <dig> mceph/mceph mice had class iv, and  <dig> of  <dig> mceph/mceph mice had class v seizures while only  <dig> out of the  <dig> kv <dig>  null mice with enlarged brain regions had class iv seizures and  <dig> of these  <dig> kv <dig>  null mice had class v seizures. the  <dig> kv <dig>  null mice with normal-sized brains had no class iv or v seizures.

hence, lack of kv <dig>  can cause a significant enlargement of ventral cortex and hippocampus, while one kv <dig>  allele was enough for normal brain region size. the variability in brain size was larger among the kv <dig>  null mice than among the mceph/mceph mice . a likely explanation for this is the presence of 6% c3heb/fej genomic background in the kv <dig>  null mice, whereas the mceph/mceph mice have a pure balb/cbyj background. we know that the mceph trait has reduced penetrance in intercrosses to other strains  <cit> . the kv <dig>  null mice are epileptic on all genetic backgrounds tested including 129/svj, n:nih-bc, c57bl/6j, c3heb/fej, swiss black and hybrids thereof, but has not previously been reported to have excessive brain growth  <cit> . investigation of brain morphology in  <dig> months old kv <dig>  null mice on 129/svj × swiss black hybrid background revealed only the typical effects of seizures in the hippocampus: neuronal loss and mossy fiber sprouting  <cit> . hence, we here report for the first time that kv <dig> .null mice can display excessive brain growth. a factor possibly increasing the severity of the brain overgrowth and the seizure behavior in mceph/mceph mice is heteromultimerization with, and hence retention of, other kv <dig> subunits in er by the mceph protein expressed in mceph/mceph mice  <cit> . we can only speculate about how lack of kv <dig>  and overgrowth of hippocampus and ventral cortex could be linked on balb/cbyj and what factors that modify this link on other genetic backgrounds. one possible explanation would be seizure-induced upregulation of trophic factors affecting cellular growth, proliferation and survival. this is supported by our observation that enlargement and elevated levels of trophic factors co-occurred spatially in mceph/mceph brain  <cit> . also, the mceph/mceph mice display, at least in hippocampal dentate gyrus, increased proliferation, neurogenesis and enhanced cell survival, as well as more neurons and astrocytes in several hippocampal regions  <cit> . it is known that there are marked differences between mouse strains in cell proliferation as well as survival rate of the new cells in the hippocampus under normal conditions  <cit> . also, seizures are known to induce cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> , with the intensity of seizures being of importance for the balance between generation of neurons and neuronal loss  <cit> . importantly, there are significant differences between mouse strains in the sensitivity and resistance of neurons to seizures  <cit> . thus, the different steps linking lack of kv <dig>  with brain overgrowth need to be further elucidated. nevertheless, the results in this study propose the possibility that some patients with epilepsy and enlarged brain  might suffer from lack of functional kv <dig>  or related protein. hence, screening for mutations in the genes encoding kv <dig> subunits should maybe be considered for these patients.

CONCLUSIONS
we were here able to demonstrate that absence of kv <dig>  can lead to an increased growth of the brain. also, the genetic background is critical and the balb/c is suitable for this study.
