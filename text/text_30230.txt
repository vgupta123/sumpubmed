BACKGROUND
caspase- <dig> is one of the most commonly shared downstream executioners in different apoptotic pathways. in the inner ear, apoptosis and molecules involved in the apoptosis pathways play an important role during development  <cit>  and in response to stress in adulthood. caspase- <dig> activation is induced in response to ototoxic stress such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, cisplatin or noise, which in turn leads to hair cell death  <cit> .

mice deficient of molecules in the apoptotic pathway are useful tools to investigate their direct molecular role in the inner ear. caspase- <dig> deficient mice, although reported to have neuronal defects and a short life span, have no other obvious developmental abnormalities  <cit> . back-crossing of the casp <dig> mutant mice to the c57bl/ <dig> strain, resulted in a longer lifespan without significant gross anatomical abnormalities  <cit> . these mice were found to have a smaller body size and to exhibit decreased hearing, hyperactivity, and circling behavior, suggestive of inner ear dysfunction.

detailed characterization of the auditory phenotypes of two strains of caspase- <dig> deficient mice with a targeted deletion of exon 5- <dig>  which encodes the qacrg pentapeptide motif in the catalytic domain of caspase- <dig>  have been reported  <cit> . in these mice, although the development of the organ of corti seems normal, degeneration of the auditory hair cells and spiral ganglion cells  <cit> , as well as hyperplasia of supporting cells  were observed  <cit>  coinciding with severe progressive hearing loss. in addition, melody, an enu mutant with a point mutation within the catalytic domain of casp <dig>  has been shown to have similar auditory phenotype. these mice also display severe hearing loss as well as loss of auditory hair cells and spiral ganglion cells  <cit> .

in contrast with the detailed characterization of the auditory phenotype in these casp <dig> mutant mice, details of the vestibular phenotype have not been reported. here we report the characterization of the vestibular phenotype in the caspase- <dig> deficient mouse.

RESULTS
profound hearing loss in caspase- <dig> deficient mice
the auditory function was assessed by auditory brainstem response  and distortion product otoacoustic emission  at  <dig> months of age. abr was used to objectively assess the function of the entire auditory pathway, whereas dpoae evaluated the cochlear function. average abr thresholds were significantly elevated  in casp3-/- mice  at  <dig> ±  <dig> db spl, compared to heterozygous casp3+/- mice  at  <dig> ±  <dig> db spl and wild type casp3+/+ mice  at  <dig> ±  <dig> db spl . in dpoae testing, the distortion product 2f1-f <dig> was significantly decreased  in casp3-/- mice  compared to casp3+/- mice  and casp3+/+ mice , which showed comparable distortion products to each other .

vestibular dysfunction in caspase- <dig> deficient mice
most casp3-/- mice were hyperactive and exhibited circling behavior with a tendency towards a unilateral directional rotation when excited. we observed that about 70% of the mice circle counter-clockwise , while 25% circle clockwise . we tested the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex  in the dark using near-infrared video-oculography to assess vestibular function in different genotypes. the frequency response of the vor in darkness for each group was characterized during horizontal rotation at  <dig> frequencies ranging from  <dig> hz to  <dig> hz, with peak velocity of  <dig> degrees/sec. little response at any frequency or velocity was recorded for casp3-/- mice  . both heterozygous casp3+/-  and wild type casp3+/+  mice exhibited a high-pass filtered vor response, with higher gains and lower phase errors with increasing stimulus frequency . the vor at  <dig>  hz was also linear over the range of peak velocities from  <dig> to <dig> deg/sec for both groups . the gain of the casp3+/- mice was intermediate between casp3-/- and casp3+/+ mice .

inner ear dysmorphism in caspase- <dig> deficient mice
anatomical analysis of the inner ear of casp3-/- mice revealed gross hypomorphology in the vestibule, mainly in the anterior semicircular canal . various degrees of malformations in the anterior semicircular canal were observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> casp3-/- mice tested, whereas all of the casp3+/- mice  or casp3+/+  had normal gross semicircular canal anatomy. the most common malformation was a decreased arc size of the anterior semicircular canal . other severe malformations included truncation or aplasia of the anterior semicircular canal. those with severe anterior semicircular canal malformations were often accompanied by a hypomorphic lateral semicircular canal , but to a much smaller frequency. however, the posterior semicircular canal was always preserved. most malformations were observed unilaterally in the left ear  or in the right ear , but also in bilateral ears . gross anatomy of the cochlea appeared normal in all genotypes .

histological studies of sensory epithelia were consistent with gross anatomy findings. the crista of the anterior- and lateral semicircular canals was hypomorphic, whereas that of the posterior semicircular canal developed normally . hair cell numbers were significantly smaller  in the anterior- and lateral crista, and in the utricle, in casp3-/- mice , whereas casp3+/- mice  and casp3+/+ mice  had normal hair cell numbers in all vestibular sensory epithelia . while the size of the hair cells looked normal, the decreased number of hair cells seemed to be the main reason for the hypomorphic anterior crista ampullaris in casp3-/- mice . in some casp3-/- mice, the anterior crista was absent, or fused with the lateral crista . all casp3+/- mice and casp3+/+ mice observed to date had normal morphology and hair cell numbers in the vestibular sensory epithelia. although most casp3-/- mice seemed to circle toward the more severely affected side of the ear, there was no significant difference between the hair cell number in the left ear and right ear .

discussion
caspase- <dig> is essential for the maintenance of normal hearing
when different regions are targeted to delete a gene of interest, the knockout mice may exhibit different phenotypes depending on the background strain, even though the same gene is deleted  <cit> . the auditory function test results from abr and dpoae of our casp <dig> -/- mice were consistent with previously reported profound hearing loss in two different strains of casp <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . the similar phenotype in the different mutant strains of casp <dig>  support a strong role for development and function in the inner ear. taken together with the normal cochlear anatomy of the casp3-/- mice, these findings suggest an essential role of caspase- <dig> in the maintenance of normal hearing after the developmental stages of the cochlea.

caspase- <dig> is important for development of the vestibule
most mutant mice with inner ear phenotypes have extensive developmental defects in the vestibular organs  <cit> . the lateral semicircular canal is one of the most vulnerable, and morphologically affected  <cit> . on the other hand, those with either isolated anterior- or posterior semicircular canal defects are rare . apaf <dig> knockout mice and casp <dig> knockout mice are a few of such mutants with specific anterior semicircular canal defect  <cit> . interestingly, both apaf <dig> and caspase- <dig> are molecules involved in apoptosis. apaf <dig> together with caspase- <dig>  form a multiprotein complex called apoptosomes, which in turn activates downstream caspase- <dig>  in the apoptotic pathway  <cit> . in these knockout mice, apoptosis is greatly reduced during development of the inner ear  <cit> . one possible mechanism leading to the phenotype is speculated to be the reduction of apoptosis, which in turn decrease the passive release of functional factors from the dying cells into the local environment  <cit> . only a few genes are known to be exclusively expressed in a specific crista or canal during development  <cit> . there is no gene reported to be expressed specifically in the anterior crista or canal. although many genes are ubiquitously expressed, differential expression of genes are required for the formation of each of the three cristae and canals <cit> . this suggests an important role for this particular apoptotic cascade involving apaf1-caspase-9-caspase- <dig> in the development of the anterior semicircular canal.

apoptosis plays an important role throughout the development of the inner ear  <cit> , including the stages during the innervation of the vestibular epithelia from the sensory ganglion and the differentiation of the otic epithelia into the sensory epithelia  <cit> . in casp3-/- mice, in contrast to the normally developed cochlea, in the vestibule, the anterior crista, lateral crista, and utricle were hypomorphic at birth. the gross innervation to these three vestibular organs was reduced in our preliminary observation of the nerve fibers and vestibular ganglion cells. the anterior crista, lateral crista, and utricle are innervated by the superior vestibular nerve  <cit> . this may suggest that caspase- <dig> is one of the major apoptotic molecules involved in the development of the superior vestibular nerve, which innervates all three vestibular organs.

either as a direct- or indirect consequence, caspase- <dig> seems to have an important role in the development of the vestibule, especially in the anterior- and lateral semicircular canals.

vestibular dysfunction in caspase- <dig> mutant mice
the horizontal vor paradigm tested the vestibular ocular pathway for the lateral semicircular canal. the vor results of the casp3+/+ mice were qualitatively similar to other studies in mice using both search coil  <cit>  and videographic methods  <cit> . in our casp <dig> -/- mice, even those with relatively normal lateral semicircular canal morphology, had little response to any stimuli tested. vidal et al.  <cit>  showed that the mutant mice with deficient vor function also had profound deficits in locomotion. it is not yet clear the extent to which peripheral versus central mechanisms contributes to the "circling behavior." the unidirectional circling behavior towards the more severely anomalous vestibule suggests that the vestibular system is functional to some degree postnatally, corresponding to the extent of hypomorphism of the vestibule. further functional and histological studies on the inner ear and central vestibular pathways would be needed to clarify these questions.

although casp3+/- did not exhibit any abnormal behavior or gross anatomical abnormalities, vor analysis revealed an intermediate phenotype. stimulation with rapid frequencies produced significant differences between casp3+/- and casp3+/+ mice, suggesting that adequate vestibular development has not occurred in casp3+/- mice.

in casp3+/- mice, we observed slightly increased hair cell numbers in most vestibular organs compared to casp3+/+ mice . in mammals, regeneration has been observed in vestibular hair cells after damage from ototoxic agents  <cit> . perhaps in the casp <dig> mutants, caspase- <dig> insufficiency causes overall decrease in cell death at later stages of development or even after birth. one possible mechanism of mild vestibular dysfunction may be that perhaps in casp3+/- mice there is an imbalance in cell population and corresponding neurons which caused improper functional development.

in our studies, we used mice at  <dig> -  <dig> months of age, in order to avoid age related changes known to affect the c57bl <dig> mice background strain. in c57bl <dig> mice, vor gain- and histological changes in the vestibular organ occur after six months of age  <cit> . differences at the highest frequency in vor performance, and whether there is a correlation with hair cell numbers in casp3+/- mice may be elucidated with further vestibular function analysis and histological studies in mice at different ages.

CONCLUSIONS
the results in this study, together with previous inner ear studies on caspase- <dig> deficient mice, indicate that  caspase- <dig> is essential for normal function of the auditory and vestibular system, and  caspase- <dig> is important for the morphogenesis of the anterior semicircular canal. these mice can be useful tools for further studies, such as characterizing morphogenesis of the anterior semicircular canal, or as a control animal for developing vestibular function tests in mice.
