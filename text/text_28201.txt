BACKGROUND
saccharides and different types of glycoconjugates constitute a diverse group of molecules, function of which range from both energy and building elements supply to facilitation of specific interactions and to modifications of properties and functions of many biologically active molecules  <cit> . many enzymes are involved in metabolic pathways of these molecules. two different systems of classification were evolved for glycosidases, which are responsible for hydrolytic cleavage of glycosidic bond. first of them, coordinated by nomenclature committee of the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology, is based on substrate specificity of particular enzymes  <cit> . unfortunately, broader substrate specificity of some glycosidases can be taken into account by assigning of more ec numbers to one enzyme only. second classification is represented by carbohydrate-active enzymes database , which is based on amino acid sequence similarities of particular enzymes  <cit> .

α-l-fucosidases  are glycosidases that are able to cleave terminal α-l-fucosyl moiety from different types of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. according to carbohydrate-active enzymes database , they belong to families  <dig> and  <dig>  which differ among each other in mechanism used for the hydrolytic reaction catalysis  <cit> . family  <dig> enzymes use a two-step double-displacement mechanism for the catalysis, , while glycosidases from family  <dig> are among so called inverting enzymes catalyzing the hydrolytic process by direct displacement mechanism. many retaining enzymes are able to catalyze not only hydrolytic reactions but also transglycosylation; i.e. the reaction, in which the final acceptor of cleaved glycosidic residue is a hydroxyl group-possessing molecule that differs from water  <cit> .

α-l-fucosidases catalyzing transglycosylation reactions might be interesting in synthesis of α-l-fucosylated molecules with potential application especially in pharmaceutical industry, as these molecules are involved in many life-important or life-threatening processes in eukaryotic organisms. cell differentiation, development, fertilization, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation or prevention of host-pathogen interaction are examples of natural processes, in which α-l-fucosylated molecules play a crucial role. abo blood group antigens are also α-l-fucosyl moiety containing molecules. cancer, fucosidosis, infection by pathogens, leukocyte adhesion deficiency type ii, rheumatoid arthritis or cystic fibrosis represent pathological events closely associated with α-l-fucosylation. in some cases, the defect in their metabolism is the nature of the disease , in other cases α-l-fucosylated motifs play an important role in the disease propagation . in several cases, changes of α-l-fucosylation were observed but the particular connection with the disease has not yet been clarified. in the pharmaceutical industry synthesis of α-l-fucosylated molecules could be used e.g. for preparation of down-regulating inflammatory response therapeutics or for targeted production of antibodies. drugs for antiadhesion therapy, cancer vaccines and transplantology could be other areas for α-l-fucosylated molecules application. fucosylated oligosaccharides could be also used in the food and cosmetic industries, as surface active agents helping to reduce surface tension and increase the solubility of otherwise insoluble materials  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to confirm the presence of a second enzyme of α-l-fucosidase in the bacterial strain p. thiaminolyticus and to characterize its hydrolytic and transglycosylation abilities. during the study we constructed a genomic library of p. thiaminolyticus in e.coli dh5α cells and detected nucleotide sequence of a new α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  consequently, we prepared an expression plasmid  and produced the enzyme as histidine-tagged fusion protein in e.coli bl <dig>  cells. hydrolytic and transglycosylation abilities  were tested for the enzyme purified by metaloaffinity chromatography.

RESULTS
isoenzymes detection
during initial experiments, while testing the possibility to purify an enzyme with α-l-fucosidase activity by chromatographic methods, it was accidentally discovered that p. thiaminolyticus produces two isoenzymes of α-l-fucosidase and that it is possible to separate them using chromatography with hydrophobic interactions on the column hitrap butyl ff  . this discovery was confirmed by native electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel followed by staining with chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucopyranoside . both enzymes with α-l-fucosidase activity displayed different mobility. cloning, sequencing and characterization of hydrolytic and transglycosylation activity of α-l-fucosidase isoenzyme iso <dig> was described in benešová et al  <dig>  <cit> . results obtained for α-l-fucosidase isoenzyme iso <dig>  will be reported here.

at first, genomic library constructed from chromosomal dna fragments of p. thiaminolyticus and plasmid puc <dig> in e.coli dh5α cells was screened for colonies displaying α-l-fucosidase activity. the simplicity of the screening was supported by the fact that cells of e.coli dh5α don’t posses any α-l-fucosidase activity. plasmid dna of the colony with the ability to cleave 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-l-fucopyranoside  was isolated and sequenced by the method of primer walking . the results of sequencing confirmed the presence of a gene encoding the enzyme with another sequence than formerly identified gene for α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  the start of the gene was identified by a determination of a presumable shine-dalgarno sequence 5’-aggagga-3’preceding the initial methionine. product of this newly identified gene will be designed as α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> in the following text. interestingly, the identified shine-dalgarno sequence was slightly different from the sequence, which was found for α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  i.e. 5’–aaggagagaa–3’. this fact probably indicates different roles of both isoenzymes in p.thiaminolyticus, as it is known that different shine-dalgarno sequences are responsible for regulation of gene expression and of protein synthesis  <cit> . the determined nucleotide sequence of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> was submitted to the embl database and is available under the accession no he <dig>  the identified sequence of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> was also compared with known protein sequences using wu-blast <dig> program. interestingly, majority of the results referred only to hypothetical bacterial proteins, function of which was not experimentally confirmed. this low similarity of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> with known enzymes, especially with glycosidases with α-l-fucosidase activity, could represent an interesting field of study for molecular modelling. preliminary modelling studies showed that α-l-fucosidases iso <dig> and iso <dig> have a common tim-barrel protein fold and retaining mechanism of action. α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> exhibits low homology with the  <dig> and  <dig> families , the domain organization refers rather to the family  <dig> 

recombinant protein production
the recombinant α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> expressed as a fusion protein with polyhistidine tag has a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the target protein was gained by affinity chromatography on the column with ni-nta agarose, exploiting the interaction of ni2+ ions and fusion histidine tag of the isolated protein. protein concentration in obtained samples of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  stained by the bradford protein assay, was approximately 1 mg/ml. processes of cultivation, disintegration and purification were followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  . only one single band, corresponding to the estimated molecular weight, is visible after the staining by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> in samples after the affinity chromatography.fig.  <dig> analysis of the expression and purification of the recombinant α-l-fucosidase from p. thiaminolyticus by sds-page. electrophoresis was carried out in 10 % polyacrylamide gel and proteins were visualized by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig>  line 1- sds-page molecular weight standards, broad range, line  <dig> - cells of e.coli bl <dig>  after expression of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  line  <dig> - supernatant after disintegration of cells after expression, line  <dig> - proteins which did not bind to the ni-nta agarose after the application of the supernatant sample, line  <dig> - fraction after wash in the binding buffer with 10 mm imidazole, line  <dig> - fraction after wash in the binding buffer with 40 mm imidazole, lines  <dig> and  <dig> - recombinant α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> from p. thiaminolyticus eluted by the binding buffer with 250 mm imidazole and desalted by gel filtration on the column pd10



characterization of hydrolytic activity
purified enzyme was used for the characterization of its hydrolytic activity with pnpα-l-fuc as a substrate. specific activity of used samples was approximately 30 μmol/min/mg. standard experiments for determination of a temperature profile, ph optimum and the dependence of initial velocity on the concentration of pnpα-l-fuc in a reaction mixture were carried out. the enzyme exhibited the highest activity at 50 °c  and the ph of  <dig>  was confirmed as optimum. kinetic parameters are summarized in table  <dig> together with characteristics of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  interestingly, while measuring the dependence of initial velocity on the concentration of pnpα-l-fuc, both isoenzymes exhibited very similar behaviour caused very probably by substrate inhibition of the enzyme at high concentrations of pnpα-l-fuc. this phenomen could be a result of simultaneous binding of more substrate molecules into the active site, thus loosing the correct orientation for the process of hydrolysis. interestingly, the values of km and ks are very similar for both isoenzymes, although α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> doesn’t belong  to the same glycosidase family as α-l-fucosidase iso <dig>  α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> achieves almost twice the enzyme efficiency of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> table  <dig> comparison of kinetic parameters of α-l-fucosidase isoenzymes from p. thiaminolyticus using chromogenic substrate pnpα-l-fuc

the role of two isoenzymes of α-l-fucosidase in a prokaryotic organism p. thiaminolyticus is not clear yet and the answer could be e.g. the substrate specificity of both isoenzymes. results published by ashida and coworkers in  <dig> could support this hypothesis  <cit> . the authors identified two isoenzymes of α-l-fucosidase produced by bifidobacterium bifidum jcm <dig>  belonging to two different glycoside hydrolase families  and differing in substrate specificity . the authors suggested that simultaneous presence of both isoenzymes is essential for the complete degradation of human milk oligosaccharides  <cit> . substrate specificity study of both isoenzymes from p. thiaminolyticus will be the aim of following experiments.

characterization of transglycosylation activity
during designing of transglycosylation experiments a few parameters had to be optimized, e.g. reaction temperature or the use of an organic solvent in a reaction mixture. the solubility of used substrate pnpα-l-fuc  was increased by addition of dimethylformamide . 10 % dmf concentration in a reaction mixture was chosen as the best compromise, as the enzyme possesed almost 80 % of original activity after 6 hours incubation in 10 % dmf and the complete lost of activity was not observed until 24 hours of incubation . transglycosylation reactions were carried out at 40 °c, as the enzyme was stable at this temperature  and its activity was relatively high. higher temperatures caused a fast lost of activity  but on the other hand, at lower temperatures the activity of the enzyme was too low for transglycosylation purposes and also solubility of pnpα-l-fuc was not sufficient. different conditions  were used for early experiments with p-nitrophenyl glycopyranosidic acceptors  to compare transglycosylation abilities of isoenzyme iso <dig> and iso <dig> better. however, after low transglycosylation potential of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> was confirmed, new experiments with optimized reaction conditions for this enzyme were not carried out.

during transglycosylation experiments different types of molecules were tested as suitable acceptors, i.e. p-nitrophenyl glycopyranosides, free saccharides, alcohols and amino acids. all reactions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography , products containing a saccharidic part were visualized by 2-methylresorcinol. results of transfucosylation reactions are summarized in table  <dig>  data obtained indicate that the enzyme is able to use p-nitrophenyl glycopyranosides, free saccharides and alcohols with a very short alkyl chain as acceptors during tranglycosylation reactions. while using methanol as an acceptor of l-fucose, the highest yield was achieved - 15 %. products of transglycosylation of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, methanol and ethanol were confirmed in reaction mixture  by mass spectrometry .table  <dig> results of transfucosylation reactions catalyzed by α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> from p. thiaminolyticus

the symbol * indicates that the transglycosylation product was confirmed by mass spectrometry



from obtained results it is possible to conclude that α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> from p. thiaminolyticus exhibits significantly lower transglycosylation potential than α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> from the same origin, as we reported in the publication benešová et al.  <dig>  <cit> . for comparison, the yields obtained for α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> during transglycosylation experiments were as follows: pnpα-l-fuc , pnpα-d-gal , pnpα-d-glc , methanol , ethanol , 1-propanol , 2-propanol , boc-l-ser-ome  and boc-l-thr-ome . however, the ability of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> to catalyze transglycosylation reaction may indicate the mechanism of catalysis, i.e. the mechanism with retention of the anomeric configuration. in such a case cleaved glycosyl residue is not transported from the covalent intermediate, generated during the first step of catalytic process, to the molecule of water but to another acceptor molecule with free hydroxyl group  <cit> . all known α-l-fucosidases using this type of catalysis are classified in cazy family  <dig>  including the isoenzyme  <dig> from p. thiaminolyticus. however, the above-mentioned low sequence similarity of isoenzyme  <dig> with known α-l-fucosidases more likely suggests the possibility to classify this enzyme in a new family.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we identified, cloned, purified and characterized the second isoenzyme of α-l-fucosidase  originating from p. thiaminolyticus. comparison of found sequence of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> with known sequences of α-l-fucosidases revealed only low similarity and made this newly described enzyme an interesting subject for crystallographic studies and molecular modelling. experiments testing the ability of the enzyme to catalyze transfucosylation reactions with different types of acceptor molecules showed only low transglycosylation potential in comparison with the α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> originating from the same microorganism. further experiments which could help to understand the presence of two isoenzymes in prokaryotic organism will be carried out.
