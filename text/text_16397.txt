BACKGROUND
plants have evolved the ability to detect potentially pathogenic microorganisms via pattern-recognition receptors  localized on the surface of plant cells  <cit> . prr proteins recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns  that are conserved motifs in the pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns  that derive from the damages caused by pathogen ingress  <cit> . detection of pathogen through prrs triggers pamp-triggered immunity  which is accompanied with rapid production of reactive oxygen species , activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  and changes in expression of immune-related genes  <cit> .

so far eight bacterial, four fungal pamps and  <dig> prrs have been identified molecularly  <cit> . the best studied pamp recognition systems in plants are represented by the bacterial flagellin recognized by the arabidopsis thaliana fls <dig> receptor and the fungal chitin recognized by the cebip receptor  <cit> . the fls <dig> protein belongs to the receptor-like kinase  gene family. the typical structure of an rlk is an extracellular receptor domain that recognizes the pamp molecule, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular kinase domain  <cit> . the cebip protein is composed of an extra-cellular lysm domain anchored to the membrane but does not contain any kinase domain  <cit> . fls <dig> and cebip are found associated with rlk proteins like bak <dig> in arabidopsis and cerk <dig> in rice respectively  <cit> . fls <dig> and cerk <dig> are positive regulators of basal defense since mutations in these genes lead to a decrease of resistance in arabidopsis  <cit>  or to a decrease of basal defense in rice  <cit> . by contrast to pamp, our knowledge on damp detection is much less advanced and only three pairs of prrs and damp have been identified so far  <cit> . one of these is the prr/damp pair between the arabidopsis wall-associated kinase  <dig>  and oligogalacturonides   <cit>  derived from the pectin embedded in the cell-wall of most plants  <cit> .

wall-associated kinases are characterized by an extracellular domain composed of one or several repeats of the epidermal growth factor  domain. the egf domain is known in animals to bind a very large range of small peptides and to dimerize upon calcium binding  <cit> . egf- containing proteins can form homo and heterodimers after ligand binding in animals  <cit> . based on homology with the kinase domain of five waks from arabidopsis  <cit> ,  <dig> genes coding wak-like  proteins were identified in arabidopsis and  <dig> in rice, revealing an expansion of the wak family in monocots  <cit> . for simplicity and following previous nomenclature in rice  <cit> , the wak-like proteins are referred as waks. among the rice waks,  <dig> have a bona fide egf extracellular domain. only a few waks from arabidopsis or rice have been shown to possess kinase activity  <cit> . similarly, only a few waks have been localized to the plasma membrane in arabidopsis  <cit>  or rice   <cit> ,   <cit> . more recently, maize zmwak was shown to be localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> . moreover, waks seem to be found in large membrane protein complexes of unknown composition  <cit> . it is not known whether waks associate with other rlks to ensure appropriate function like several other rlks  <cit> .

in plants, several ligands were shown to bind the extracellular domain of wak proteins. for example the atgrp <dig> protein binds to atwak <dig>  <cit>  and pectin and ogs bind atwak <dig> and atwak <dig> . it was shown that upon pectin treatment atwak <dig> activates the mitogen-activated kinases mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> and that a tap-tagged  version of atwak <dig> constitutively activates ros production and defense gene expression  <cit> . however, there is no indication that native waks can trigger ros and there is only very limited information on defense gene expression during infection  <cit> .

waks are involved in plant development  <cit> . for instance, atwak <dig> and atwak <dig> are required for cell wall expansion  <cit> . accordingly, wak mutants are often affected in their development. in rice, plants silenced for osdees1/oswak <dig> displayed fertility deficiency  <cit>  that was attributed to a defect in embryo development. plants silenced for the rice indica osiwak <dig> gene were stunted  <cit>  and in arabidopsis, silencing of atwak <dig> and atwak <dig> is lethal  <cit> .

the role of waks in plant disease resistance initially came from indirect evidence with wak mutants affected in the triggering of defense-related response  <cit> . later, several studies provided direct evidence that wak genes participate to resistance. first, it was shown that the rfo1/wakl <dig> gene is responsible for quantitative resistance to fusarium  <cit>  and verticilium  <cit> . more recently, two distinct wall-associated kinases from maize were shown to be responsible for a major qtl for resistance to the soil-borne fungus sporisorium reilianum   <cit>  and one against the foliar fungal pathogen exserohilum turcicum   <cit> . secondly, several mutant analyses of wak genes provided evidence for their involvement in disease resistance. the over-expression of atwak <dig> led to enhanced resistance to botrytis  <cit>  and over-expression of oswak <dig> enhanced resistance to magnaporthe oryzae  <cit> . on the other hand, silencing of slwak <dig> in tomato lead to enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas synringae pv tomato  <cit> . other examples of the effect of waks on bacterial and fungal resistance are reported although the corresponding proteins miss an egf domain   <cit>  or a kinase domain   <cit> . thus several wak mutants seem to act as positive regulators of disease resistance to fungi and bacteria without visible developmental phenotypes. however, there is thus far no indication that pti is affected in these mutants.

another indication that waks are related to disease response comes from the observation that wak genes are often regulated by bacterial infection in arabidopsis  <cit>  and by blast infection in rice  <cit> . quite interestingly, there are two cases of pathogens that manipulate wak gene expression by either expressing small rna interfering with their rna  <cit>  or by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . thus waks are important components of basal defense that pathogens try to inhibit. pamps can also directly regulate the expression of wak genes  <cit> . flagellin induces several wak genes in arabidopsis  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . chitin induces oswak <dig> in rice in a cebip dependent manner in cell cultures  <cit>  and the atwakl <dig> gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the global regulation of wak genes in pti is not well understood.

here we report that several rice wak genes are up-regulated while oswak112d is down-regulated by fungal infection in rice. part of this transcriptional control is likely due to chitin detection by the chitin receptor cebip. we provide evidence that oswak <dig>  oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> act as positive regulators of quantitative resistance, while oswak <dig> acts as a negative regulator. by studying oswak <dig> mutants, we demonstrate that this wak significantly participates to ros production and defense gene expression during infection.

RESULTS
oswak expression is influenced by blast infection
previous transcriptome analysis identified five oswak genes differentially expressed upon infection by m. oryzae in rice . phylogenetic analysis revealed that excluding oswak <dig>  all blast responsive waks are from one major clade of rice waks designated wakb and that they belong to four different, clearly distinct wakb sub clades .

to further investigate on these blast-responsive waks, their expression profile in compatible and incompatible interactions was measured at early and late infection stages  and  <dig> to  <dig> hpi) using isolates fr <dig> and cl <dig> respectively . all oswaks transcripts were differentially expressed during infection in at least one time point and expression changes were similar in compatible and incompatible interactions. at late infection stages, except oswak112d, all oswak genes were induced and expression induction was often more evident in susceptible plants than in resistant ones. during early infection , the expression of oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> was induced. by contrast, oswak112d transcripts, and to a lower extent oswak <dig>  were repressed early. thus, among the various transcriptional changes found for the tested oswaks, most were induced during infection, sometimes even before fungal penetration  and one, oswak112d was repressed.fig.  <dig>

chitin triggers oswak gene expression
the early and non-isolate specific differential expression of the oswak genes  suggested that a pamp common to these isolates was the trigger for oswak gene regulation during early infection. chitin is common to all fungi and has been shown to act as an important pamp in several biological systems  <cit>  including rice  <cit> . to test the effect of chitin on oswak gene expression, plants were sprayed with chitin oligomers and the expression of oswaks was determined. chitin strongly and rapidly induced the expression of the blast-induced genes  oswak <dig> and oswak <dig>  while the blast-repressed oswak112d was down-regulated  by the chitin treatment. the expression of oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> was induced to a much lower extent by the chitin treatment. therefore, we conclude that oswak genes show similar expression trends after chitin treatment  and during early stages of blast infection .

in order to test whether chitin regulates oswaks in a receptor-dependent manner, oswak gene expression was analyzed in mutant lines deficient for cebip, the major chitin receptor in rice  <cit> . chitin oligomers were sprayed on cebip loss-of-function mutant plants  <cit>  and gene expression was measured until 2 h after treatment . mutants in cebip have been shown to display a reduced transcriptional response of oswaks to chitin oligomers  <cit> . for oswak <dig> and oswak <dig>  chitin-triggered gene expression was significantly reduced in the cebip mutant . by contrast the induction of the other chitin-responsive oswak genes and the repression of oswak112d were only slightly affected by cebip mutation. this supports our hypothesis that the cebip receptor is required for proper activation and repression of several oswak genes upon chitin treatment.

different requirements of oswaks for quantitative resistance to rice blast
to elucidate the role of blast- and -chitin responsive waks in disease resistance, mutant lines were searched in the oryzatagline mutant collection  <cit> . two allelic lines for oswak <dig>  and one line for each oswak <dig>  oswak <dig> and oswak112d were identified . the insertion lines harboured a tos <dig> retrotransposon inserted into the coding sequence of the respective oswak genes. for each insertion line, we isolated one homozygous line for the tos <dig> element  and one sister line without the tos <dig> element . we confirmed that the expression of the targeted oswak gene was reduced in each mutant line as compared to the null-segregant line . the mutant lines did not show any obvious growth phenotype , including full fertility in the wak <dig> mutant despite previous report showing that rnai of this gene leads to sterility  <cit> .

to determine whether the wak mutations could affect r gene mediated resistance, we tested the avirulent m. oryzae isolate cl <dig> on wak mutant and null-segregant lines. after inoculation with isolate cl <dig>  we did not observe any difference between the wak mutants and their respective null-segregant .

to test the impact of wak mutations on basal resistance, we inoculated the wak mutants with the virulent m. oryzae isolate fr <dig>  the wak14- <dig>  wak14- <dig>  wak <dig> and wak <dig> mutants were all more susceptible to isolate fr <dig> than their respective null-segregant controls  and displayed an increased number of sporulating lesions . on the opposite, wak112d mutant plants were more resistant to blast disease. this was manifested by a  <dig> -fold reduction of disease lesion numbers. thus wak mutants are affected for blast susceptibility, suggesting that the corresponding oswak genes are important elements of basal disease resistance.fig.  <dig> resistance to m. oryzae is affected in wak loss-of-function mutants. plants were inoculated with the virulent isolate fr <dig> of m. oryzae and disease was measured  <dig> dpi. for each line, a homozygous mutant  and the corresponding null-segregant  is presented. a the number of lesions on the youngest fully expanded leaves of at least  <dig> plants of homozygous and null-segregant lines was counted  <dig> dpi. the values were transformed in percentage relative to the mean of null-segregant lines, and means and standard deviations were calculated. a t-test was performed to establish whether one given mutant line was different from its corresponding null-segregant line . the experiment was repeated seven times and one representative experiment is shown. b pictures were taken 5 days post inoculation. susceptibility is characterized by the grayish lesions while small brown spots derive from some residual resistance



effects of over-expression of the oswak <dig> and oswak112d genes on basal resistance to blast fungus
in order to further investigate the role of the oswaks in blast resistance, we decided to produce rice plants that over-express oswak <dig> and oswak112d. we focused on these two genes as they represented the most pronounced expression patterns after infection  as well as the strongest disease phenotypes in the corresponding loss-of-function mutants .

after infection with the virulent strain fr <dig>  all 10t <dig> plants over-expressing oswak <dig> showed reduced symptoms compared to plants transformed with the empty vector . by contrast, over-expression of the oswak112d gene increased susceptibility compared to empty vector . in order to further analyze these disease resistance phenotypes, single locus insertion lines were selected. in the t <dig> generation, plants without t-dna and sister plants with t-dna were identified and their seed amplified to give rise respectively to homozygous null-segregants  and over-expresser lines  . the oe and ns lines were inoculated with the moderately virulent m. oryzae isolate gy <dig>  we observed a decrease in lesion number for the oe-wak <dig> plants  and an increase for the oe-wak112d plants . thus, it appears that the over-expression of oswak <dig> or oswak112d alters basal resistance and that both genes have opposite effects on quantitative resistance, consistent with the phenotypes observed with the loss-of-function mutants.fig.  <dig> 
oswak <dig> and oswak112d over-expresser lines are affected for m. oryzae resistance. expression of oswak <dig> and oswak112d was measured by quantitative rt-pcr in non-infected lines over-expressing  oswak <dig>  or oswak112d  genes and the corresponding null-segregant lines . gene expression, calculated from three biological replicates, was normalized using actin. the fold change between ns and oe is also indicated . plants were inoculated with the virulent isolate gy <dig> of m. oryzae. the total number of lesions was counted as in fig.  <dig> in the lines oe-oswak <dig>  or oe-oswak112d . for each mutant line, the average number of lesions over more than  <dig> plants was calculated for the corresponding over-expresser and null-segregant line. this value was used to calculate the percentage of lesions per individual mutant plant as compared to the mean of the null-segregant plants. the mean and standard deviation was then calculated. this experiment was repeated three times and one representative experiment is shown. a t-test was done to evaluate the significance of the observed differences . pictures of typical symptoms on over-expresser and null-segregant lines were taken 5 days post inoculation . several other over-expresser lines were also produced and analyzed 



defense induction in oswak <dig> mutant lines
to further characterize the increased partial resistance of oe-wak <dig> lines, individual interaction sites were examined by microscopy . two days after infection, the number of hyphae that penetrated into rice epidermal cells was only slightly reduced in oe-wak <dig> lines and 3 days after inoculation, the proportion of fungal hyphae that invaded more than one cell was strongly reduced. these data suggest that oswak <dig> over-expression enhances resistance against fungal penetration and affects the in planta growth of the blast fungus and/or the invasion of new cells.

to get further insights on how oswak <dig> gene affects basal resistance, we measured several molecular markers of basal defense in the oswak <dig> lines  two days post inoculation, at a time where only small differences in fungal growth were visible . we first tested whether the oxidative burst, one of the earliest responses to fungal invasion was affected. two days after inoculation, the production of h2o <dig> as measured by dab staining was two times higher in oe-wak <dig> lines and two times lower in ko-wak <dig> lines compared to their respective controls . using qrt-pcr on defense marker genes, we then evaluated whether defense was enhanced before and during infection. we could not detect any significant difference of expression of the defense marker genes before inoculation in oe-wak <dig> compared to control lines . by contrast, several markers tested were significantly induced to higher levels in oe-wak <dig> plants 48 h post inoculation . thus, we could correlate the increased level of resistance of oe-wak <dig> visible at  <dig> dpi with an increase in h2o <dig> production and defense-gene induction at  <dig> dpi.fig.  <dig> defense gene expression and h2o <dig> production in oe-wak <dig> lines. oe-wak <dig> lines were inoculated with m. oryzae  and we measured two facets of plant defense response at  <dig> hpi: h2o <dig> production  and expression of genes responsive to infection . mean values are provided with the standard error . statistical differences were evaluated according to one-way anova followed by fischer’s  or dunnett’s  tests: p <  <dig>  , p < <dig>   and p < <dig>  . a h2o <dig> production in loss-of function and oe-oswak <dig> was expressed as the percentage of infection sites  showing dab staining. b expression of defense-related genes in the oswak <dig> over-expresser  and null-segregant  lines



discussion
the expression of oswak genes is induced by chitin under the control of the cebip receptor
several previous reports indicate that oswaks genes are transcriptionnaly regulated during m. oryzae infection  <cit> . by investigating the regulation of oswaks during early infection steps, before penetration of m. oryzae, in both resistant and susceptible plants we confirmed that five selected oswak genes are differentially expressed upon infection by virulent and avirulent isolates of m. oryzae . we showed that the differential expression of the oswak genes was, overall, more intense in the case of quantitative resistance  than in complete resistance . this is contrasting with the report that the oswak <dig> gene is more induced in resistant plants than in susceptible plants  <cit> . quite interestingly, the oswak1gene belongs to another phylogenetic group than all oswaks tested here . this may explain these differences in transcriptional regulation.

the oswak <dig> and oswak112d genes were characterized by their differential expression early after inoculation . this is also contrasting with the observation that the oswak <dig> gene is induced rather late after infection   <cit> . quite notably, the oswak112d gene was down-regulated in the early phases of infection  and as expected from vergne et al.  <cit>  was slightly induced after  <dig> hpi. the triggering of some of oswaks expression before fungal penetration  suggested that a molecule constitutively present in fungi could elicit this expression. chitin, a molecule that is known to elicit defenses in rice  <cit>  was tested. chitin alone triggered induction of the oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> genes and the repression of the oswak112d gene , thus mimicking the events observed during infection . using the cebip mutant, we show that the regulation of expression by chitin of oswak <dig> and oswak <dig>  and to a lower extent the other oswak tested, is controlled by cebip. thus oswak gene regulation by chitin is partially affected by the cebip mutation. testing cerk <dig>  <cit> , lyp <dig> and lyp <dig>  <cit>  mutants is required to establish if these other chitin receptors are involved in triggering oswaks expression. atwak <dig> and atwak <dig> genes are slightly down-regulated by flg <dig>  <cit>  while atwakl genes are up-regulated  <cit> . similarly, transcriptome analysis indicates that the expression of the atwakl <dig> gene is triggered by chitin  <cit> . thus wak gene regulation by pamps seems to be a common feature in plants.

oswak genes are required for quantitative resistance to rice blast fungus
there are now six reports that wak genes are involved in disease resistance. in dicots, several studies report on the role of waks in disease resistance: rfo1/wakl <dig>  <cit> , atwak <dig>  <cit> , slwak <dig>  <cit> . in rice, there is only one report that the over-expression of the oswak <dig> gene enhanced resistance to m. oryzae  <cit> . more recently two qtl for resistance to fungal disease in maize were shown to encode wak genes  <cit> . our work showing the involvement of four oswak genes in rice blast resistance significantly extends this list and reinforces the notion that these receptor-like kinases play a central role in basal resistance. indeed, we show that three loss-of-function mutants in oswak <dig>  oswak <dig> and oswak <dig> have reduced basal resistance towards a virulent isolate of the rice blast fungus . the two independent mutant alleles of the oswak <dig> gene displayed similar phenotypes, suggesting, despite the lack of complementation analysis, that oswak <dig> is a positive regulator of blast resistance. the fact that oswak <dig> loss-of-function displayed reduced resistance combined to the fact that over-expression of the oswak <dig> gene leads to enhanced resistance  suggests that this gene is also a positive regulator of blast resistance. whether oswak <dig> is also a positive regulator of basal resistance awaits additional genetic demonstration.

quite strikingly, the mutant in the oswak112d gene and over-expression of the oswak112d gene led to increased resistance and susceptibility respectively. altogether with the observation that this gene is repressed upon infection , this indicates that oswak112d is a negative regulator of basal resistance that rice plants repress during infection. similarly, the arabidopsis lrr-rlk feronia gene was shown to negatively regulate the signaling pathway involved in basal defense  <cit> . thus our results extend the observation that negative regulation by rlk of signaling pathways could be a common trend in plants.

thus far the kinase domains of the majority of rlk involved in disease resistance belong non-rd group  <cit> , including oswak <dig>  it is noteworthy that all oswaks tested in this study belong to the wakb sub-group  which are characterized by kinase domains of the rd type  <cit> , like all known arabidopsis waks. thus this work indicates that several oswak genes from this wakb/rd kinase sub-group are also regulators of quantitative resistance to the blast fungus in rice.

oswak <dig> participates in plant defense response
measurement of h2o <dig> production  and defense genes expression  in oswak <dig> mutant lines indicated that this gene is involved in both responses to pathogen. this is consistent with the enhanced basal resistance levels observed in over-expressing plants . in particular plants over-expressing oswak <dig> displayed enhanced h2o <dig> production and defense-related gene expression. only limited evidence suggests that waks can regulate, directly or indirectly, defense-gene expression. indeed, in their study, zuo et al.  <cit>  provided some evidence that three genes  out of six tested were slightly up-regulated by zmwak upon infection. our results are consistent with such slight modifications. by contrast to zuo et al.  <cit> , we did not observe any enhanced expression of defense-marker genes before inoculation triggered by the over-expression of oswak <dig>  thus waks may have different ways for activating defense.

as proposed by others  <cit> , our data support a model in which recognition of pamps like chitin would lead to an increased expression of oswaks and an increase in oswak receptors at the plasma membrane. subsequently, damps produced by pathogen ingress could be recognized by oswak <dig>  triggering an enhanced immune response. further experiments are needed to test this model, such as extensive time course analysis of defense response in wak <dig> mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that several oswak genes are required for quantitative resistance in rice to the blast fungus m. oryzae. more importantly, we showed that among the four oswak genes functionally analyzed, one is a negative regulator. in arabidopsis, pectin was shown to bind atwak <dig> and atwak <dig> and to activate signal transduction  <cit> . whether pectins play a similar role in rice needs to be tested. more generally, identifying the molecular signal recognized by these oswaks proteins is now possible by the use of the mutants lines described in this study.
