BACKGROUND
campylobacter species are one of the most common causes of human enteritis in north america . while campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the most commonly isolated species, studies have also implicated 'cryptic' species within the genus, such as campylobacter concisus, as causal agents of acute enteritis  <cit> . compared to c. jejuni, c. concisus is fastidious to isolate as it is often sensitive to selective antimicrobial agents commonly-used in conventional isolation media, and generally requires a hydrogen-enriched atmosphere and a prolonged incubation period for growth  <cit> . as such, it is rarely cultured by standard isolation methods employed by many diagnostic facilities. although knowledge of its clinical importance is limited, c. concisus has been cited as an emerging human pathogen  <cit> .

campylobacter concisus was originally isolated from periodontal lesions  <cit> . however, its pathogenic role in oral cavity infections remains uncertain, since it can also be isolated from healthy gingiva  <cit> . additionally, c. concisus has been isolated from the feces of diarrheic patients  <cit> , often in the absence of known pathogens. however, the bacterium is also frequently isolated from feces of asymptomatic patients, which has lead to the conclusion that it may be part of the normal intestinal microbiota  <cit> . some evidence indicates that c. concisus may be an opportunistic pathogen. for example, engberg et al.  <cit>  observed that c. concisus was predominantly isolated from pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, in contrast to c. jejuni and c. coli which are typically isolated from diarrheic patients of all ages. consequently because of its association with diarrheic, healthy, and immunocompromised patients, the specific role of c. concisus as a primary intestinal pathogen has yet to be firmly established.

campylobacter concisus is a heterogeneous species complex comprised of several phenotypically indistinguishable but genetically distinct taxa . numerous methods can be used to genetically separate the genomospecies, including pcr analysis of the 23s rrna gene  <cit>  and cluster analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism  or random amplified polymorphic dna  profiles  <cit> . based on these typing methods, at least two main c. concisus genomospecies have been identified  <cit> .

differences in pathogenicity amongst distinct genomospecies of some bacterial taxa  <cit>  support the notion that certain c. concisus genomospecies may be more likely than others to cause intestinal disease. while an early study by van etterijck et al.  <cit>  concluded that c. concisus was not pathogenic given similar isolation rates from diarrheic and healthy children, genetic diversity of the isolates with respect to clinical presentation was not considered. a more recent study showed that isolates from healthy individuals were genetically distinct from those of diarrheal origin; however, differences in epithelial cytotoxicity between the two groups were not evident  <cit> . additionally, cluster analysis of diarrheic isolate aflp profiles delineated two main c. concisus genomospecies , which where characterized by type strains of oral and diarrheal origin, respectively  <cit> . genomospecies  <dig> isolates were more frequently isolated from the stool of patients presenting with diarrhea in which no other pathogens were found, and bloody diarrhea was associated only with genomospecies  <dig> isolates. while these studies suggest that distinct c. concisus genomospecies may vary in their pathogenic ability, this has yet to be empirically examined.

our understanding of campylobacter pathogenesis is based primarily on c. jejuni. its small, spiral shape coupled with flagella-mediated motility, allow c. jejuni to penetrate intestinal mucus  <cit>  where it can then adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells. this bacterium can also translocate across the intestinal epithelium via a paracellular mechanism involving disruption of epithelial tight junctions  <cit>  or via a lipid raft-mediated transcellular mechanism  <cit> . c. jejuni also causes cellular cytotoxicity through the production of various toxins; cytolethal distending toxin  is a well-characterized toxin produced by most strains. the cytolethal distending toxin blocks cell proliferation in the g2/m phase resulting in cellular distension leading to the induction of apoptotic cell dealth  <cit> . this bacterium also induces intestinal epithelial secretion of interleukin- <dig> , a pro-inflammatory chemoattractant that recruits neutrophils to the site of infection  <cit> . cytolethal distending toxin-like activity has been reported for a majority of clinical c. concisus isolates  <cit> , however the role that this toxin plays in pathogenesis is unknown. a membrane-bound haemolytic phospholipase is also produced by most clinical c. concisus isolates  <cit> . in addition, c. concisus genes coding for zonnula occludins toxin  and a surface-layer protein belonging to the rtx  family  have been recently identified  <cit> . zonnula occludins toxin was first recognized as a toxin of vibrio cholera, and disrupts the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by targeting tight junctions  <cit> . s-layer rtx is a pore-forming toxin that is also found in campylobacter rectus  <cit> , and toxins within this family are recognized as important virulence factors  <cit> .

the present study examines the hypothesis that the two main c. concisus genomospecies exhibit differences in pathogenicity. to address this hypothesis, we compared genotypic and pathogenic properties of c. concisus fecal isolates from diarrheic and asymptomatic  humans. specifically, genotypes of isolates were compared by aflp analysis and a genomospecies-specific 23s rrna gene pcr assay. numerous pathogenic properties were also assessed including:  intestinal epithelial adherence, invasion, and translocation;  ability to disrupt epithelial permeability, cause apoptotic dna fragmentation, affect metabolic activity, and induce il-8; hemolytic and cytotoxic activities; and  carriage of toxin genes encoding cdt, zot, and s-layer rtx proteins.

RESULTS
genotypes
sequence analysis to confirm the identities of the clinical isolates indicated >99% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity  between the type strain c. concisus lmg <dig> and all of the clinical isolates . based on the genomospecies-specific pcr assay of the 23s rrna gene  <cit> , six and  <dig> of the  <dig> clinical c. concisus isolates were assigned to genomospecies a and b, respectively . three isolates generated pcr products for both genomospecies a and b primer sets , and one isolate did not amplify with either primer set . the type strain, lmg <dig>  was assigned to genomospecies a, consistent with previous observations  <cit> . campylobacter concisus-specific pcr of the cpn <dig> gene was strongly positive for  <dig> isolates including the type strain and weakly positive for two isolates. weak pcr products were likely due to mismatching of the pcr primers with their target gene , resulting in inefficient pcr amplification.

discussion
the observed high level of genetic diversity amongst the isolates of c. concisus is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , and highlights the complex nature of this species. cluster analysis of aflp profiles indicated that the isolates examined in the current study comprised at least two distinct clusters. similarly, aabenhus et al.  <cit>  denoted four aflp clusters among  <dig> c. concisus isolates of which the majority  were assigned to one of two main clusters. results of pcr assays targeting the 23s rrna and cpn <dig> genes largely corresponded with the aflp grouping, and lend support to the suggested genetic relationship between the isolates.

as c. concisus is a common inhabitant of the oral cavity, it is to be expected that it may be isolated from both healthy and diarrheic individuals. examining isolates from healthy individuals, it was observed that the majority of isolates belonged to genomospecies a and their aflp profiles clustered together  along with the type stain of oral origin. this aflp cluster also included one genomospecies a isolate  from a diarrheic individual. further studies are needed to determine whether this group of isolates represents inhabitants of the oral cavity that have survived gastro-intestinal transit or whether they are intestinal-associated.

the majority  of isolates from diarrheic individuals were assigned to alfp cluster  <dig>  among these isolates, 71% were assigned to genomospecies b, while only 11% of diarrheic isolates belonged to genomospecies a. engberg et al.  <cit>  reported a similar predominance of genomospecies b isolates among diarrheic fecal isolates, of which 33% and 67% were assigned to genomospecies a and b, respectively. likewise, aabenhus et al.  <cit>  reported that 34% and 53% of fecal isolates from diarrheic patients were assigned to genomospecies a and b, respectively. our observation that isolates from genomospecies b were exclusively obtained from diarrheic individuals suggests a potential role for these isolates in intestinal disease. a comparative molecular examination of strains belonging to genomospecies a and b may shed light on their respective pathogenic potential.

examination of the pathogenic properties amongst c. concisus isolates determined that epithelial invasion and translocation were higher for isolates assigned to aflp cluster  <dig> . additionally, epithelial translocation was higher for isolates belonging to genomospecies b . this is of potential clinical relevance as invasiveness and translocation ability are the only factors definitively correlated with enteritis in c. jejuni-infected patients  <cit>  and are likely associated with inflammatory responses and occasional bacteraemia observed with c. concisus infections  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study to report differences in pathogenicity between the two main c. concisus genomospecies, further supporting the likelihood that isolates belonging to aflp cluster 2/genomospecies b incite enteritis in humans.

all of the clinical c. concisus isolates examined in the current study caused hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, consistent with previous observations of hemolytic phospholipase activity in all c. concisus genomospecies a and b isolates from diarrheic children  <cit> . as such, hemolytic activity appears to be a general characteristic of this species. hemolysins are involved in pathogenesis and host colonization in other taxa  <cit> , thus it was an unexpected observation that c. concisus genomospecies a isolates exhibited greater mean hemolysis than isolates belonging to genomospecies b. we also observed that hemolytic activity by c. concisus was inversely correlated with epithelial adherence and invasion. staphylococcus aureus exhibits a similar inverse correlation that is attributed to interference of its α-hemolysin with epithelial β1-integrins that mediate host-cell interactions  <cit> . moreover, lower amounts of α-hemolysin are produced by invasive s. aureus isolates from endocarditis patients compared to less-invasive isolates from open wounds  <cit> . whether c. concisus hemolysin also interferes with epithelial receptors that promote adherence and invasion is unknown, and additional studies are warranted.

another unexpected finding was that isolates from healthy individuals induced greater mean epithelial dna fragmentation and metabolic activity compared to those from diarrheic individuals, and these variables were positively correlated. dna fragmentation is used as an indicator of cell death. the two primary modes of cell death, namely apoptosis and necrosis, can be distinguished on the basis of physiologic features. dna fragmentation can be present in both processes; however, during apoptosis, cell membranes typically remain intact, whereas during necrosis, cellular integrity is rapidly disrupted leading to the release of cytoplasmic contents  into the surrounding environment . based on this definition, four isolates from healthy individuals  and two isolates from diarrheic humans  induced cell death consistent with apoptosis. while apoptosis can be mediated via cdt  <cit> , it is unlikely that cdt was involved in the apoptosis given that we did not detect the cdtb gene in any of the strains included in our study. furthermore, we did not find any genes with similar sequence to the cdtb gene using a blast search of the published c. concisus genome , indicating that other factors  may be responsible. the role that campylobacter-induced epithelial cell death plays in pathogenesis is currently poorly understood; hence, the clinical significance of these findings for c. concisus remains to be determined.

metabolic activity can be measured using the mtt assay in which metabolically active epithelial cells reduce a yellow tetrazolium salt  to purple formazan crystals that can be spectrophotometrically quantified. all of the isolates that we examined, except one isolate that caused epithelial sloughing , induced higher mtt values  than the control, indicating that epithelial metabolic activity is increased by c. concisus. some clinical strains of c. jejuni have also been reported to cause similar increases in epithelial mtt values  <cit> . given the short incubation period for the mtt assay, we conclude that the increased values most likely reflect an increase in metabolic activity due to cellular stress rather than an increase in epithelial cell numbers due to proliferation. the observed correlation between metabolic activity and dna fragmentation may be a consequence of the increased energy demands required to sustain the apoptotic process .

the chemokine, il- <dig> is a major mediator of inflammation. in the current study, all c. concisus isolates induced transcription of il- <dig> in epithelial monolayers  as has been previously reported for c. jejuni  <cit>  and c. concisus  <cit> . campylobacter jejuni induces epithelial il- <dig> secretion by at least two independent mechanisms, one of which requires invasion and the other that is cdt-dependent  <cit> . we observed that induction of il- <dig> transcription by c. concisus was not correlated with invasion. man et al. also recently showed that three c. concisus strains stimulated production of il- <dig> in intestinal epithelial irrespective of their invasive ability  <cit> . thus in contrast to c. jejuni, it appears that factors other than invasion or cdt  are responsible for the up-regulation of il- <dig> incited by c. concisus. the observation that expression of il- <dig> mrna was greater in epithelial cells treated with isolates from aflp cluster  <dig> compared to isolates from cluster  <dig> was unexpected and suggests that these isolates may have pathogenic potential.

we identified genes encoding s-layer rtx and the zonnula occludins toxin in some of the isolates, confirming initial reports of these toxin genes in c. concisus  <cit> . surprisingly, the zot gene was more prevalent in isolates from healthy  compared to diarrheic  humans. the clinical significance of this observation remains to be determined. although zot has been shown to disrupt epithelial tight junctions, we did not observe any changes in permeability or ter of epithelial monolayers throughout the  <dig> h incubation period for any of the isolates. this is contrary to the observation of man et al., that c. concisus caused increased epithelial permeability, decreased ter, and loss of membrane-associated zonnula occludens and occludin in epithelial monolayers  <cit> . possible reasons for this discrepancy include variation in methodology between the two studies .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, two main genomospecies were identified among fecal isolates of c. concisus from healthy and diarrheic individuals. the genomospecies differed with respect to clinical presentation and pathogenic properties, which is consistent with the hypothesis that certain genomospecies have different pathogenic potential. aflp cluster  <dig> was predominated by isolates belonging to genomospecies b and those from diarrheic individuals. isolates from this cluster displayed higher mean epithelial invasion and translocation than cluster  <dig> isolates, consistent with a potential role in inflammatory diarrhea and occasional bacteraemia. in contrast, isolates assigned to aflp cluster  <dig> belonged to genomospecies a and were predominantly  isolated from healthy individuals. isolates assigned to this cluster induced greater expression of epithelial il- <dig> mrna and more frequently contained genes coding for the zonnula occludins toxin and the s-layer rtx. furthermore, isolates from healthy individuals induced greater apoptotic dna fragmentation and increased metabolic activity than did isolates from diarrheic individuals, and isolates assigned to genomospecies a  exhibited higher haemolytic activity compared to genomospecies b isolates. this suggests that isolates from this cluster may also cause disease, albeit via different mechanisms than isolates from aflp cluster  <dig>  aflp cluster  <dig> contains a reference strain isolated from the oral cavity, thus it is possible that this cluster contains isolates that are primarily periodontal pathogens.

while in vitro pathogenicity assessments are informative, they do not necessarily correspond with the ability of an isolate to cause disease in vivo. clearly, further studies, particularly in vivo, are needed to confirm that these genetically distinct groups of c. concisus indeed differ in their ability to cause intestinal disease. in this regard, comparative genomic and pathogenicity examinations using animal models have been initiated.
