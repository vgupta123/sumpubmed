BACKGROUND
tilapia is the common name for a group of cichlid fishes native to africa and the middle east. the annual yield of farmed tilapia and captured tilapia reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  million tons, respectively, in  <dig>  <cit> , making this fish one of the most important food fishes in the world. though tilapias normally live in freshwater, a few species of them show high salt tolerance and could be raised in brackish water or sea water  <cit> . mozambique tilapia and its hybrids, including red tilapia are the major representatives of these euryhaline cichlids in aquaculture  <cit> . due to the increasing lack of freshwater in the world, it would be beneficial to culture tilapia stocks in brackish or saline rearing environments to ensure a source of cheap and high-quality animal protein into the future. based on the growth performance in salt water, mozambique tilapia and red tilapia are competent candidates for breeding saline tilapia strains  <cit> .

a genetic linkage map is an essential framework for qtl mapping of important traits, positional cloning of interesting genes and understanding of genome evolution  <cit> . the first-generation linkage maps of cultured fish species were constructed mainly by using dominant markers such as rflp, rapd and aflp  <cit> . due to the quick development of sequencing and genotyping technologies, co-dominant markers, such as microsatellites and snps, have replaced dominant markers for constructing linkage maps  <cit> . due to their high polymorphism and application of genetic analyzers that enable high-throughput, automatic and precise genotyping, microsatellites have been the main markers used in genetic mapping of major aquaculture species such as atlantic salmon  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , channel catfish  <cit> , grass carp  <cit>  and asian seabass  <cit> . recently, snps were used in constructing a high density linkage map of salmon  <cit> . several linkage maps have been constructed using microsatellite and aflp markers  <cit>  in tilapia. two of them were constructed based on nile tilapia and f <dig> hybrids of nile tilapia and blue tilapia, respectively  <cit> , and a third linkage map constructed based on a three-way cross family contained only  <dig> markers from mozambique tilapia  <cit> . an integrated genetic linkage map is still unavailable in saline tilapia.

sex determination is complex in vertebrates. in birds and snakes, females have a pair of zw heteromorphic chromosomes  <cit> , while in mammals, most males have a y chromosome which harbors a male-determining gene sry  <cit> . the mechanisms of sex determination are more complex in fishes, where sex is determined by different genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . some closely related fishes in the same genus may have different sex-determination systems, such as xy and zw. the dmy gene was identified as a sex-determining gene in medaka , but not in other fish species  <cit> . in previous studies, markers associated with sex determination were mapped to lg <dig> and lg <dig> in nile tilapia  <cit> . in addition, another sex determination locus was found on lg <dig> in the hybrid population of o. niloticus x o. aureus <cit> . nile tilapia, mozambique tilapia and blue tilapia all are classed into the genus oreochromis. the first two share a xy sex determination system while blue tilapia has a zw one  <cit> . though sex-determination loci in nile tilapia and blue tilapia have attracted much attention, few reports have been published in mozambique tilapia.

to facilitate the mapping of quantitative trait loci  for important traits and comparative genomics studies, we have constructed a consensus linkage map of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia using microsatellites, and conducted comparative mapping. in addition, we have performed a whole genome search for sex-determining loci, and found that sex-determination loci of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia were located on lg <dig> and lg <dig> , respectively.

RESULTS
microsatellite makers
sequences of  <dig>  ests of tilapia were downloaded from genbank, and assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. after analyzing these unisequences using siroko software  <cit> ,  <dig> sequences containing microsatellites of at least seven perfect repeats were obtained, and  <dig> of them were further selected for the designing of primers to amplify the microsatellites in genome dna. among the  <dig> pairs of primers,  <dig> amplified specific products in both mozambique and red tilapia, and  <dig> were informative in mapping families. in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers from the previous tilapia map  <cit>  produced informative genotypes. a total of  <dig> informative markers were used in the linkage analysis .

linkage analysis
consensus linkage map
four hundred and one markers, including  <dig> from ests and  <dig> from the previous tilapia map, were assigned to the consensus map, while the remaining six markers remained unmapped. the consensus map consisted of  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig>  cm . the number of markers per linkage group ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the average inter-marker distance was  <dig>  cm . in most parts of the linkage map, the marker spacing was less than  <dig> cm, while only one marker interval on lg <dig> was bigger than  <dig> cm .


maps of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia
the linkage maps of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia were also constructed , respectively. these two maps contained  <dig> and  <dig> markers, and spanned  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively. the number of shared markers was  <dig>  and the total lengths of the map based on shared markers were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm in mozambique tilapia and red tilapia, respectively . the number of linkage groups and the marker order in the two maps were basically identical, except lg <dig>  where a region of three markers in the middle of the group in mozambique tilapia was located at the end of the group in red tilapia. in addition, the recombination rate of lg <dig> in mozambique tilapia was much higher than in the red tilapia, and that of lg <dig> was lower than red tilapia .


comparison between the female and male maps
linkage maps were also constructed for males and females . the maps of males and females contained  <dig> and  <dig> markers, and spanned  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively. these two maps shared  <dig> markers, and the total lengths of the linkage map based on shared markers were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm in males and females, respectively. the ratio of lengths of the common interval in females and males was  <dig> . though females and males had similar map lengths, the differences of recombination rates between the two genders were significant on a few linkage groups. for instance, the ratios of lengths between females and males were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  on lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively .

comparison between the present map, previous maps and mapping markers onto the genome sequence of nile tilapia
by comparing the positions of shared markers, we established the correspondence of linkage groups between the present map and the previous tilapia maps . all  <dig> markers derived from  <dig> linkage groups of a previous map  <cit>  were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups in our map. the previous groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> were merged into lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively, reducing the linkage group numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  which corresponded to the  <dig> chromosomes in tilapia. for convenience, we named our linkage groups according to the previous maps with the exception of the former groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the former groups  <dig> and  <dig> had been merged into groups  <dig> and  <dig>  and the former groups  <dig> and  <dig> corresponded to the present groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

after blast against the genome sequences of nile tilapia in ncbi, all  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> scaffolds, including  <dig> of the  <dig> largest scaffolds in genome sequences .

annotation of mapped ests
after blast against nt and nr databases in ncbi using  <dig> marker sequences derived from ests,  <dig> of them were annotated by known genes, including immune-related genes such as mhc i, chemokine receptor, interleukin- <dig> receptor, alpha-2-macroglobulin, lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein and adamts- <dig> protein, and growth-related genes such as somatostatin and growth hormone receptor. most annotations had a hit of e-value less than 10- <dig> .

comparative mapping
among all  <dig> mapped marker sequences,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had a specific and significant hit in stickleback, medaka, pufferfish, and zebrafish, respectively. a total of  <dig> markers matched at least one model fish, and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> markers matched two, three, and four model fishes, respectively . surprisingly, most of these homologous markers from the same linkage group in tilapia were located in one or two chromosomes in model fishes , indicating obvious homologous chromosomal relationships between tilapia and all four model fishes .


a comparative map between tilapia and stickleback was constructed . a total of  <dig> markers were assigned to the paired linkage groups in the map. all linkage groups in tilapia also had one major homologous group in stickleback except group  <dig> and  <dig>  which had two homologous groups. in addition,  <dig> markers of tilapia with significant hits were assigned to unmapped scaffolds in stickleback .


mapping of sex-determining loci
the nonparametric mapping identified only one sex-determining locus on lg <dig> in the mapping family mr-cross  <dig> and another sex-determining locus on lg <dig> in the mapping family mr-cross  <dig>  . both interval mapping and mqm mapping were further used to discover potential sex determination loci, while the permutation test was used to determine the lod value of 95% confidence interval. the results verified the results of the nonparametric mapping data, where only one sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was found in mapping family mr-cross  <dig>  and only one sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was found in mapping family mr-cross  <dig> .

when we verified the sex-determining loci in seven families, all families showed significant correlations between sex and genotypes of markers from lg <dig> or lg <dig>  these results indicate the locus on lg <dig> was the only sex-determining locus in mozambique tilapia and hybrid tilapia produced by mozambique tilapia males, and the locus on lg <dig> was the main sex-determining locus in hybrid tilapia produced by red tilapia males. the breakpoint analysis of recombination revealed that the xy sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was located between omo <dig> and omo <dig>  and the xy sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was mapped between gm <dig> and omo <dig> . however,  <dig> individuals  had the genotypes of opposite sex on lg <dig>  further genotyping was performed for lg <dig>  and no correlation between sex and genotypes of markers from lg <dig> was found in these individuals.


discussion
microsatellites for linkage mapping in tilapia species
although some microsatellites developed in one species can be used in other closely related species, the success rate of cross-species amplification is usually low  <cit> . in this study, microsatellites derived from the genome and est sequences of nile tilapia were used to construct a linkage map for saline tilapia. among  <dig> microsatellites from nile tilapia,  <dig> amplified specific and polymorphic products in mozambique tilapia and red tilapia, indicating that the majority  of microsatellites could be universally used in nile tilapia, mozambique and red tilapia for genetic and genomics studies.

the linkage maps in tilapias and recombination rates
several genetic linkage maps have been constructed in tilapias previously  <cit> . the first two maps, one in nile tilapia, and another based on a three-way cross family, were constructed mainly using dominant aflp markers  <cit> . though a female map of mozambique tilapia was constructed in the three-way cross family, it only consists of  <dig> linkage groups with  <dig> loci  <cit> . the latest linkage map in tilapia was constructed using an f <dig> interspecific hybrid family between nile tilapia and blue tilapia, consisting of  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . in the present study, we constructed the first integrated linkage map in mozambique and red tilapia. well-known for their high salt tolerance, mozambique tilapia and its hybrid including red tilapia have been widely used in the aquaculture and breeding of saline tilapia  <cit> . the consensus and linkage maps of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia, all consisted of  <dig> linkage groups.  <dig> mapped markers were derived from ests, and  <dig> of them were annotated by known genes, including genes related to immunity and growth. the potential inversion between mozambique tilapia and red tilapia found in lg <dig> in the present study, along with the differences of karyotypes among tilapias reported before  <cit> , indicates that some significant differences may exist in chromosomes between different tilapia species. with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm, the present map provides a useful resource for qtl mapping of important commercial traits, comparative mapping and positional cloning of interesting genes in saline tilapia. however, we have noticed that one marker space on lg <dig> was still larger than  <dig> cm. therefore, it is essential to map more dna markers in this space to facilitate qtl mapping for important traits.

one hundred and nineteen microsatellite markers from  <dig> linkage groups of a previous map, along with  <dig> markers from ests were assigned to  <dig> linkage groups. the marker order on each linkage group among the present and the previous maps were almost identical . the lg <dig> and lg <dig> of the previous map merged into lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. these merges reduced the number of linkage groups from  <dig> to  <dig>  equal to the chromosome pair number in mozambique tilapia and nile tilapia  <cit> , and resolved the discrepancy between linkage group number and chromosome number in the latest linkage map of tilapia  <cit> .

comparing the linkage groups between mozambique tilapia and red tilapia revealed significant differences in the recombination rate on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  similar results have been reported in other species, such as fox and dog  <cit> . these results suggest that recombination rate is unequal in different genome regions and species. different ratios of recombination rates between females and males have been reported in a number of species. females usually have a higher recombination frequency than males. for example, the female: male recombination ratios were  <dig> : <dig> in atlantic salmon  <cit> ,  <dig> : <dig> in channel catfish  <cit> ,  <dig> : <dig> in zebrafish  <cit>  and 2: <dig> in grass carp  <cit> . however, the linkage map of females was shorter than that of males in striped bass  <cit> . nearly identical recombination rates between females and males have been referred in hybrid tilapia previously  <cit> . in this study, the ratio of lengths of common intervals in females and males was  <dig> , indicating that males had a similar recombination frequency of the whole genome as females in tilapia.

syntenies between different fish species
the sequences of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> mapped markers had significant hits in the whole genome sequences of stickleback, medaka, puffer fish, and zebrafish, respectively, suggesting that stickleback is more closely related to tilapia than the other three model fishes. all linkage groups in tilapia mainly corresponded to one or two linkage groups, or chromosomes in the four model fishes , implying the high evolutionary conservation of chromosomes in these five fish species. some conserved syntenies of fish chromosomes also were reported in medaka  <cit> , pufferfish  <cit> , seabream  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , grass carp  <cit>  and striped bass  <cit> .

among all  <dig> linkage groups in tilapia, lg <dig> corresponded to two chromosomes in all four model fishes, and lg <dig> corresponded to two chromosomes in stickleback and medaka, implying that these two groups may be formed by two independent fusion events. it is believed that the ancestral karyotype of cichlids consisted of  <dig> chromosome pairs  <cit> . however, how the haploid chromosome number of most tilapiines reduced to  <dig> remains unclear. one hypothesis is that the largest chromosome in tilapiines came from the fusion of three chromosomes  <cit> . however, our results suggested that the modern karyotype of tilapiines may be formed by two separate fusions of two sets of two independent chromosomes. these two fusions may have lead to the reduction of the  <dig> chromosome pairs to  <dig> pairs in most tilapiines.

among all four model fishes compared, only medaka from superorder acanthopterygii has a haploid chromosome number of  <dig>  which conforms to the presumed ancestral karyotype of cichlids. in addition, each linkage group in tilapia correlates to one homologous chromosome in medaka except lg <dig> and lg <dig>  each of which coincides with two chromosomes. the syntenies between proto-chromosomes in vertebrates and chromosomes in medaka have been previously speculated  <cit> . in the present study, the simple and clear correspondences between  <dig> linkage groups of tilapia and  <dig> chromosomes of medaka indicate that medaka may possess the most possible ancestral karyotype of cichlids in four model fishes.

a potential inversion on lg  <dig> was found between mozambique tilapia and red tilapia. differences of karyotype between nile tilapia and mozambique tilapia have been reported previously. mozambique tilapia had four metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes and  <dig> acrocentric or subtelocentric ones, while nile tilapia only had two metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes  <cit> . our red tilapia originated from the hybrid of mozambique tilapia and nile tilapia. the difference of marker order on lg <dig> between the two tilapias may be caused by the hybrid origination of red tilapia.

mapping of sex determination loci
two sex determination systems, xy and wz have been identified in tilapias  <cit> . three sex determining loci have been identified on lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> of tilapias  <cit> , respectively, indicating the complexity of the sex determination in tilapia,. a sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was reported in female heterogametic  tilapias including t. mariae, o. karongae, o. tanganicae and israeli stain of o. aureus. a sex determining locus on lg <dig> was found in male heterogametic  nile tilapia and t. zillii <cit> , and the sex determining locus on lg <dig> was only found in nile tilapia  <cit> . in the present study, only one sex determination locus on lg <dig> was found in our reference families produced by mozambique tilapia males, which were identified as male heterogametic. however, cnaani et al. found that markers on both lg <dig> and lg <dig> were associated with sex in three families of mozambique tilapia and two families of the egyptian strain of blue tilapia, and the sex determination of these reference families could not be defined as male or female heterogametic  <cit> . mozambique tilapia and blue tilapia were known as male heterogametic and female heterogametic, respectively  <cit> . our results are identical to the traditional view and differ from the results of cnaani et al.  <cit> . this divergence may be caused by the different genetic backgrounds of reference families and strains. interspecies crosses were prevalent in the tilapias, and most of the hybrids were fertile and could reproduce offspring as purebred fish  <cit> . these hybrids may spread in the farmed strains as well as in wild populations, and lead to the complex pattern of sex determination in some tilapia strains.

since the sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was identified mainly in tilapias with the xy sex determination system, and the sex-determining locus on lg <dig> was identified mainly in tilapias with the wz system  <cit> , we may conclude that the sex determining locus on lg <dig> determined the male heterogamete and the sex determining locus on lg <dig> determined the female heterogamete in tilapiine species. as these sex determining loci existed in closed species from the genus of both oreochromis and tilapia <cit> , it seems that the two sex-determining loci may both emerge prior to the differentiation of oreochromis and tilapia, and underwent independent evolution in different species. alternatively, the tilapiine species may only have one ancestral sex determination locus, which more likely to be the sex-determining locus on lg <dig> as predicted by some researchers  <cit> . after the differentiation of oreochromis and tilapia, another sex-determining locus appeared and spread to specific species by interspecific hybridization.

we have also identified a xy sex-determining locus on lg <dig> in red tilapia. this sex-determining locus was reported only in nile tilapia  <cit> . our local red tilapia strain in malaysia and singapore originating from the hybrid between nile tilapia and mozambique tilapia  <cit> . the sex-determining locus on lg <dig> in red tilapia may originate from nile tilapia instead of mozambique tilapia. as it only was found in nile tilapia and red tilapia, the sex-determining locus on lg <dig> may have a later origination than the sex-determining loci on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  in this study, the sex-determining loci on lg <dig> and lg <dig> were identified in different types of families, which were produced by mozambique tilapia males or red tilapia males, respectively. there was no family found to have these two sex-determining loci at the same time. further research is needed to understand the interactions between the sex-determining loci on lg <dig> and lg <dig> 

about 30% of individuals from two families produced by the red tilapia males showed no association between sex and genotypes of lg <dig> or lg <dig>  indicating that there are more genetic or environment factors which may be involved in the sex determination in red tilapia. due to its hybrid origination, red tilapia may have more complex mechanisms of sex determination than mozambique tilapia.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a first consensus linkage map of mozambique tilapia and red tilapia. the map consisted of  <dig> linkage groups, spanning  <dig>  cm and containing  <dig> microsatellite markers derived mainly from ests. comparative mapping between tilapia and four model fishes indicates that high evolutionary conservation of chromosomes existed in these fish species. two separate fusions of two sets of two independent chromosomes may lead to a reduction of  <dig> chromosome pairs in their ancestor to  <dig> pairs in tilapias. sex-determining loci in mozambique tilapia and red tilapia were mapped on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. our linkage map and markers linked to the sex-determining loci provide a useful resource for genetic improvement of salt tolerance tilapia and future genomics study in fish.
