BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressing activity of the protein p <dig> is down-regulated by the ubiquitin ligase mdm <dig> which complexes p <dig> and targets it for degradation  <cit> . in normal cells the p <dig> protein, which also is a transcription factor active at the mdm <dig> promoter, is maintained at low levels through this negative feedback loop. in damaged cells the mdm2-p <dig> complex is destabilized through posttranslational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation. this disrupts the complex, frees p <dig> which then activates the repair or apoptotic pathways  <cit> . this has spawned several studies aimed at to the development of peptides/small molecules that can displace p <dig> from its complex with mdm <dig>  <cit> . the structural data on the mdm2-ligand complexes available in protein data bank  show a wide structural variation amongst the several mdm2-inhibitor complexes. these reveal a highly plastic nature of the binding pocket of mdm <dig> . the significance of this plasticity in inhibitor design has been addressed in recent studies  <cit> . one residue that has been found to play a major role in modulating this plasticity through the size of the binding pocket is y <dig>  <cit> . the orientation of the y <dig> side chain controls the size of the binding pocket and also contributes to the stabilization of the ligands in the complex by enabling stable interactions. both, the crystal structure   <cit>  and molecular dynamics  simulations of the complex of mdm <dig> and a  <dig> residue fragment of the transactivation domain of p <dig> show that y <dig> points away from the binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond  with either the backbones of e <dig> or n <dig> of wild type  p <dig> peptide. this stabilizes an unstructured c-terminal region of the peptide that lies outside the binding pocket  <cit> . in addition, there are conformational states with small molecules/peptides bound where y <dig> 'points in' towards the binding pocket and stabilizes the complex with a different set of interactions  <cit> . recently, it was reported from biochemical measurements that the p27s mutant of p <dig> has a higher affinity for mdm <dig> than wild type p <dig>  simulations revealed that in the complex, the peptide adopts an α-helical conformation at the c-terminus  and a rearrangement of the network of interactions occurs. there is a dramatic change of the mdm <dig> surface which is caused by the reorientations of the l <dig> and y <dig> side chains. the flip of the latter towards the binding pocket organizes a cozier fit of the ligand and stabilizes an hb with the l <dig> backbone, suggesting an induced fit mechanism of peptide binding  <cit> .

on the other hand, the apo state of mdm <dig> as evidenced by the ensemble of nmr structures   <cit>  shows that y <dig> sits in a deeply buried position  which is remarkably different from that in its complexed state. this suggests a possible coupling of the dynamics of y <dig> with the binding of p <dig>  interest has recently been focused on the differences between pre-organized binding/conformational selection  or induced binding   <cit> . to investigate this we have carried out a series of molecular dynamics simulations of systems containing mdm <dig> and p <dig> in various states. the main focus is on investigating the changes that take place in p <dig> and in mdm <dig> as they approach each other. a somewhat similar investigation but with coarse graining simulations has recently been reported  <cit> . the study shows the conformational changes associated with the transition from uncomplexed  state to the complexed states of mdm <dig> which leads to the diverse conformational states of mdm <dig> 

we have used molecular dynamics simulations to examine three different conformations of mdm2:  'open' state of the conformation taken from the wild type  complex  with the y <dig> side chain pointing away from the binding pocket;  'closed' state - the conformation of mdm <dig> taken from the complex with α-helical p27s mutant of p <dig> with the y <dig> side chain pointing towards the binding pocket;  the 'apo' state - the unliganded state of mdm <dig>  obtained from the ensemble of nmr structures  <cit>  where y <dig> is in a deeply buried position .

other approaches to investigate such phenomena are brownian dynamics simulations  <cit> , replica exchange methods  <cit>  and the more recently developed accelerated molecular dynamics methods  <cit> . while the brownian dynamics methods are well suited for studying protein-protein associations where proteins are depicted in a reduced representation  <cit> , the replica exchange methods can be used to examine pathways of folding  <cit> ; the accelerated molecular dynamics methods have been very successful in examining long time scale processes  <cit> . in this study, we are attempting to understand atomic level details of the process prior to the embedding of p <dig> into mdm <dig>  aspects of this process involve a coupling between folding and binding, at least of the p <dig> peptide  <cit> . we have chosen to run classical molecular dynamics simulations with several different starting conditions and as will be seen, these capture local folding/unfolding events through extensive surface rearrangements. a major factor that limits the usage of replica exchange methods here is that the current system is comprised of around  <dig> amino acids and replica exchange methods, particularly in explicit solvent, can only meaningfully  be applied to peptides that are up to  <dig> amino acids long  <cit>  and hence are not suitable for the sort of extensive surface rearrangements that we sample here. moreover, the mdm <dig> binding site is highly hydrophobic and there is the possibility that it will rapidly unfold in the remd methods. for the same reason, the accelerated molecular dynamics method was not used.

RESULTS
we first outline briefly the currently accepted picture of the mechanism of interaction between p <dig> and mdm <dig> in their bound state. crystallographic, biophysical and computational studies have traditionally shown that f <dig>  w <dig> and l <dig> are the three critical residues of the transactivation domain  of p <dig> which largely determine the stability of its complex with mdm <dig>  <cit> . the residues f <dig> to l <dig> form an α-helical segment which has a hydrophobic face that subtends the side chains of the three hydrophobic residues f <dig>  w <dig> and l <dig> which get embedded in the binding pocket of mdm <dig>  in addition to the hydrophobic interactions between these  <dig> residues and mdm <dig>  the w <dig> side chain also makes an hb with the backbone of l <dig> of mdm <dig>  and this is very critical for the stability of the complex  <cit> . more recently, it has been demonstrated that other parts of both p <dig> and mdm <dig> are involved in modulating these interactions  <cit> . one residue whose dynamics appear to potentiate this binding is y <dig> of mdm <dig> which "gates" the conformation of the p <dig> peptide. this residue is conserved across species . if the p <dig> peptide is extended at its c-terminus , the side chain hydroxyl of y <dig> is involved in hydrogen bond  with the backbone of either e <dig> or n <dig> of the p <dig> peptide; however the p <dig> peptide can also adopt an α-helical conformation at its c-terminus and this is potentiated by the y <dig> hydroxyl forming an hb with the backbone of l <dig> which provides a 'cozier' fit between the p <dig> peptide and mdm <dig>  <cit> . we set out to investigate the mechanism that governs the development of these interactions as p <dig> approaches mdm2; we are particularly interested in examining the modulation of the conformational activity of y <dig>  recently, a study has investigated such a process using targeted simulations of the binding pathway under a coarse grained description  <cit> . in contrast, here we examine the process of binding, without directing the binding, and in an all-atom model with explicit solvation. the steady behavior of the root mean squared deviations  of mdm <dig> in the various situations shows that the simulations are stable .

p <dig> and 'open' mdm2
when p <dig> approaches the 'open' state of mdm <dig> from a distance of  <dig> Å, , complex formation is rapid and the crystallographically observed state is reached with most of the interactions reported above reproduced. the w23-l <dig> hb forms within  <dig> ps. the y100-e <dig> hbond takes somewhat longer  to form. indeed, the complex is stabilized by  <dig> ns, which suggests that preorganization of the partners into 'reactive' conformations leads to rapid complex formation . this of course was enabled because we started with the crystal structure conformations . this is in accord with the models proposed and observed in other simulations for protein-protein interactions  <cit> . moreover, the enthalpy of binding close to what has been reported elsewhere using the crystal structure of the complex ; the difference is expected due to the different starting states. indeed it is heartening to see the similarity of the two values, suggestive of a real productive encounter between p <dig> and mdm <dig> starting  <dig> Å apart. interestingly y <dig>  the residue spatially contiguous to y <dig> undergoes side chain mobilities that are larger in magnitude to those in y <dig> and yet are correlated with it .

the source of the coordinates of the structures has been reported in the text. the rmsd corresponds to the p <dig> backbone in the starting structures of the simulations, after superimposing the mdm <dig> of the on the crystal structure of the mdm2-p <dig> complex.

in contrast, when p <dig> approaches the "open" state of mdm <dig> from a separation of ~ <dig> Å , it manages to reach the surface of mdm <dig> in the vicinity of the binding pocket  within  <dig>  ns. however the interactions are nonspecific and p <dig> never manages to embed into mdm <dig> completely. the fact that it reaches the surface originates in the long range electrostatic fields that will no doubt steer the two molecules  <cit> . the w <dig> side chain forms interactions with the side chain of f <dig> which appears to displace p <dig> to a position slightly away from its native  location. at the same time, y <dig> flips in towards the binding pocket; this presumably happens to minimize the exposure to solvent of a very hydrophobic binding pocket of mdm <dig>  again the mobility of y <dig> is correlated with that of y <dig> .

p <dig> and 'closed' mdm2
we next examine the approach of p <dig> towards mdm <dig> when the latter is in its 'closed' state. f <dig> and w <dig> find their crystallographically observed positions  within  <dig>  ns, but l <dig> is obstructed by y <dig> which points into the binding pocket . the hb between the w <dig> side chain and the l <dig> backbone is transiently stable because the w <dig> is prevented from approaching sufficiently close to mdm <dig> . this is because of competition between the w <dig> side chain and the y <dig> side chain for hbonding with the backbone of l <dig> and also because the surface of mdm <dig>  as defined by an inward-pointing y <dig>  occludes p <dig>  eventually l <dig> is "kicked out" by y <dig> . in the trajectory mc3at <dig> y <dig> is further forced to remain in its closed conformation by the extended c-terminus of the p <dig> peptide. to further probe the effect of the restraint imposed upon y <dig>  we modified the initial conformation of the c-terminus of p <dig>  the backbone conformations of residues 27- <dig> were changed in a manner that released the spatial constraint upon y <dig>  now we observe  that y <dig> flips out after just a few nanoseconds and in turn enables p <dig> to nicely fit into the binding pocket of mdm <dig>  in a conformation resembling that of the wt crystal structure ; this clearly highlights the effect of the c-terminal region of p <dig> on modulating the gating of y <dig> of mdm <dig>  the mobility of y <dig> is correlated strongly with that of y100; interestingly, when no binding takes place, the magnitude of fluctuations of both side chains are similar, while upon binding events, the mobility of y <dig> is correlated with that of y <dig> but the magnitude is larger .

when p <dig> was placed  <dig> Å away from the binding pocket of mdm <dig> , again, as seen in the "open" state described above, p <dig> reaches the surface of mdm <dig> in the vicnity of the binding pocket within  <dig>  ns. in contrast to the "open" state, here y <dig> flips out to fully open the binding pocket. even as f <dig> attempts to dock, it provides an anchor that enables w <dig> and l <dig> to move towards their binding pockets. however, local collisions induce a rotation in the w <dig> side chain away from the orientation optimal for its binding. this results in p <dig> moving away from the surface of mdm <dig> and the w <dig> side chain adopts a stacking interaction with f <dig> of mdm <dig>  . we extracted a structure of the p53-mdm <dig> complex from this trajectory which whose conformation had the lowest deviation from the crystallographic complex , and that had y <dig> pointing "out"; this was subject to an md simulation . this structure forms the crystallographically observed interactions in less than a nanosecond, including the w23-l <dig> hb . again y <dig> mobility is correlated with that of y <dig> . here we see some evidence of the presence of an intrinsic harmonicity with open-closed states of the y <dig> appearing at a timescale of ~3- <dig> ns.

p <dig> and 'apo' mdm2
thus far we have used the complexed state of p53-mdm <dig> determined crystallographically to seed the starting conformations of our various investigations. given that the structure of mdm <dig> is available in its uncomplexed or "apo" state from nmr  <cit> , we decided to use this as our starting state for mdm <dig>  in all the  <dig> conformations of mdm <dig> available, the tyr <dig> points inwards; this is expected as this minimizes the exposure of the very hydrophobic binding pocket of mdm <dig> and also enables the hb between the backbone of leu <dig> and the side chain hydroxyl of tyr <dig>  when p <dig> was placed near the binding pocket of mdm <dig> , surprisingly p <dig> loses its helicity. this appears to be due to the fact that the side chains of mdm <dig> in this nmr-derived state are not optimally located to interact with p <dig> . however, as the system explores the conformational states, we soon observe that mdm <dig> interacts with w <dig> and f <dig> of p <dig> and its binding pocket is induced to open . although this does not lead to the crystallographically observed state of the complex, w <dig> and f <dig> do embed in the binding pocket which leads to stabilization of the hydrophobic pocket of mdm <dig>  f <dig> gets packed by several hydrophobic residues including i <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig> and f <dig> . the interesting observation is that although the orientation of the side chains of f <dig> and w <dig> change to a non native conformation, we do not see dissociation of the complex. it appears that at the initial stage of complex formation, helical conformations of p <dig> can initiate complex formation that can be seeded by an initial insertion of f <dig> into the hydrophobic pocket. this in turn is complemented by some expansion of the overall pocket of mdm <dig> that enables w <dig> to get embedded .

to examine these later stages of binding we take the last  snapshot of the above trajectory and replace p <dig>  by p <dig> taken from the crystal structure. we find that despite p <dig> being in its optimal conformation, in these simulations y <dig>  does not enable p <dig> to embed and indeed pushes it away. in addition, the side chains of h <dig> and r <dig> obstruct the c-terminus of p <dig>  once again, y <dig> is constrained by the presence of the c-terminal end of the ta of p <dig>  and cannot flip out to create space for w <dig> to embed. this indicates that prior to the binding of p <dig>  the opening of the hydrophobic pocket of mdm <dig> by transition of y <dig> to its 'open' conformation appears to be a key step to facilitate this binding. the interesting feature is that the mobility of y <dig> is now dependant upon the position of the lid. the movies in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show that that once the lid opens, y <dig> goes into an open state but y <dig> is still constrained by the lid and does not open.

discussion
the ta of p <dig> is known to be largely intrinsically disordered with some parts of it adopting a helical conformation upon binding to mdm <dig>  this brings three side chains  of p <dig> to be displayed on the same face of the helix thus enabling them to embed into a hydrophobic binding pocket of mdm <dig>  experimental data show that the unliganded state or the apo-state of mdm <dig>  is quite different from its complexed state . what is not understood well is the process of binding of p <dig> and mdm <dig> to each other, mediated by these conformational states: is it pre-organization prior to binding or is it reorganization after binding . to test these, we have carried out a series of md simulations that mimic the approach of p <dig> to mdm <dig>  we avoided the simulation of folding/unfolding transitions of p <dig> during the simulations  <cit>  and assumed that when p <dig> is very close to mdm <dig>  stereo-chemical constraints would demand that the helical conformation of p <dig> be dominant in its interactions. we have mostly focused on the plasticity of mdm <dig> and the dynamics of y <dig>  the structural data shows that the plasticity of the binding pocket of mdm <dig> is mainly determined by the orientation of y <dig> , with spatially contiguous y <dig> correlated with y <dig> in mobility. when p <dig> is in its native  state and mdm <dig> is "open", binding occurs with only small local reorganizations as side chains reorient minimally to maximize interactions. the size of the binding site, as determined from the solvent accessible surface area  varies from ~ <dig> Å <dig> to ~ <dig> Å <dig> as the mdm <dig> transits from a relatively closed apo state to the p <dig> bound state. the general fluctuations of mdm <dig>  are conserved in pattern across the various simulations but the magnitudes vary. this is understandable because the peptide and mdm <dig> modulate each other and this will certainly change depending on their relative orientations, with the largest mobility witnessed in the presence of the lid . the one outlying feature is the high mobility of the 30- <dig> region when p <dig> is actually binding to mdm <dig> in approximately the crystallographically observed mode. while this region is distal to the p <dig> binding side, nevertheless the fact that it is high compared to the equilibrium dynamics  <cit>  suggests that real equilibrium has not been achieved . when p <dig> is distant from mdm <dig>  y <dig> can assume both "in" and "out" states, with only the "out" state enabling binding. the binding process requires an initial encounter complex that is driven by nonspecific forces where electrostatic steering plays a major role. this is then accompanied by either the embedding of phe <dig> or w <dig>  that act as anchors across which the other two residues can be embedded. both these residues, w <dig> and l <dig> require that y <dig> is in an "out" conformation. this would enable the sidechain of w <dig> to make an hb with the backbone of l <dig> . when y <dig> is "in", it also occludes l <dig> from embedding. at the same time, when y <dig> is "in", the c-terminal region of the ta of p <dig> also plays a critical role in modulating the dynamics of y <dig> by preventing its transition to "open" states .

the nmr ensemble shows that the "apo" states of mdm <dig> have y <dig> "in"  <cit> . this is to minimize the exposed hydrophobic surface of the binding pocket. what is interesting is that these "apo" states, derived from nmr, had their n-terminal  <dig> residues  removed prior to simulations . if the lid is included in the simulations , there are two scenarios . in some of the structures, the lid is localized over the binding site and pushes against y <dig> and even during simulations, y <dig> remains "in". however, there are some structures where the lid is localized away from the binding pocket. simulations of these structures show that the restraint of the lid on y <dig> is rapidly released and y <dig> assumes an "out" conformation . the same happens of the lid is deleted and then simulated in the absence of p <dig>  this once again highlights the importance of the restraints that the local environment places upon the gating of y <dig>  y <dig> in turn modulates the size of the binding pocket and also controls the local polarity by releasing the l <dig> backbone as a potential hydrogen bonding partner . thus this suggests that a re-organization or induction to "open" and "closed" from "apo" states may be induced by the lid . these in turn can be modulated by the presence of p <dig> and can either directly bind p <dig>  or when p <dig> can induce an open state from a closed state by the conformational dynamics of the c-terminal end of the ta domain. this starts assuming significance biologically for several reasons:  the control of the size/polarity of the binding pocket by y <dig> can affect the binding of p <dig>  and small molecules. we have shown how the orientation of y <dig> modulates the thermodynamics of the peptidic inhibitors  <cit> , a feature also demonstrated in other computational studies  <cit> ;  the increasing importance of the mdm <dig> lid region, which is strictly conserved in mammals, in modulating the binding of p <dig>  <cit> ; it is possible that by gating the dynamics of y <dig>  the lid region may influence the kinetics of binding of p <dig>  the lid is known to compete only very weakly with peptidic inhibitors of mdm <dig>  <cit> . however to our knowledge, there is no published data available on the kinetics of peptide binding as modulated by the lid region in mdm <dig>  the work of worall et al.  <cit>  has shown that the lid dynamics mostly modulate the ligase activity of the mdm <dig> which involves interactions of the lid with a region away from the p <dig> ta binding n-terminal region. it is clear that there must be a correlation between lid dynamics and substrate access as has been also found in several other systems as lactate dehydrogenase, lipases, adenylate kinases  <cit>   these questions assume greater significance with recent observations pointing to the increasingly complex interactions between mdm <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . while our findings of the role of y <dig> in modulating the equilibrium dynamics of the complex are in agreement with the findings of others  <cit>  the added insights brought about by our studies, i.e., the modulation of the dynamics of the peptide and protein even before the binding event has taken place, is particularly relevant to understanding the on-rates of different peptides and perhaps may provide insights into the development of peptidic therapeutics whose rates of binding may be tunable.

CONCLUSIONS
molecular dynamics simulations have revealed how the binding of p <dig> to mdm <dig> is modulated by the conformational mobility of y <dig> which is the gatekeeper residue in mdm <dig>  they also reveal how the mobility of this residue itself can be modulated by the conformations of p <dig> and by the conformations of the nterminal lid region of mdm <dig>
