BACKGROUND
adventitious roots refer to roots that form from any tissue that is not a root, such as leaves and stems. this is part of the normal development of a plant and occurs naturally or can also be induced by stresses such as wounding, flooding, and etiolation  <cit> . under environmental stress, adventitious rooting acts as an alternative or supplement to seed propagation and is an important mechanism in response to stresses  <cit> . this method of vegetative propagation in plants has been widely used for the commercial production of woody forest and horticultural species  <cit> . the formation of adventitious roots has been associated with important aspects of tissue dedifferentiation and can be induced reproducibly under the control of exogenous phytohormones. auxin acts as an effective inducer of adventitious roots in many plants and may interact with other endogenous factors or environmental stimuli during this process . horticultural and agricultural practices have demonstrated that the external application of auxin exerts a great effect in inducing adventitious rooting in many plant species. indole-3-butyric acid  is used worldwide as a rooting hormone due to its higher stability and efficiency versus indole 3-acetic acid . in cells, iba converts into iaa and acts as a slow release source of iaa  <cit> . auxin can induce ethylene production via the up-regulation of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase  <dig>  gene, which was found to be an early auxin-induced gene  <cit> , to further promote adventitious rooting  <cit> . although auxin plays a crucial role in inducing cell dedifferentiation and root primordium formation, the exact mechanism of its action is still poorly understood.

the physiological and biochemical changes that occur during the complex process of in vitro root development have been extensively investigated in last few decades. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process must be further explored. in recent years, various molecular and genetic approaches have been used to identify the genes involved in regulating adventitious root development in arabidopsis and other plants. among the genes identified, several gene families in the auxin signaling pathway have been shown to mediate adventitious rooting in many plants, such as the members of the auxin-inducible arf  family  <cit> , members of the auxin-inducible gh <dig>  family  <cit> , the tryptophan-dependent iaa biosynthesis gene yucca  <cit> , the auxin efflux carrier genes pin  and abcb/pgp  , the auxin influx carrier gene aux1/lax   <cit> , and the auxin-responsive lob-domain  genes  <cit> . lob-domain transcription factors encoded by several phylogenetically, closely related genes, such as the rice genes arl <dig>   <cit>  and crl <dig>   <cit> , the maize gene rtcs   <cit> , the medicago gene mtlob <dig>  <cit> , and the arabidopsis genes lbd <dig>  and lbd <dig>  <cit> , have been identified and shown to mediate adventitious rooting. moreover, the scarecrow-like genes  <cit> , the cytokinin type b response regulator  gene  <cit> , and the apetala2/ethylene response factor  transcription factor genes  <cit>  have also been demonstrated to be involved in modulating adventitious rooting. using cdna microarrays, brinker et al.  identified  <dig> genes that were significantly changed during root development in hypocotyl cuttings of pinus contorta under iba treatment  <cit> . holmes et al.  identified  <dig> and  <dig> up- and down-regulated probe sets in root-forming cultures of medicago truncatula as well as significant changes in metabolism, signaling and the expression of transcription factors linked to in vitro adventitious root formation processes  <cit> . despite this, the gene expression profile during adventitious rooting in response to auxin remains uncharacterized.

recently, rna-seq has been used to explore transcriptomic data and study gene expression at the whole genome level in model and non-model organisms  <cit> . de novo short read assembly technology has been successfully applied to identify gene expression profiles and discover new genes without a reference genome sequence  <cit> . this technology platform enables the precise elucidation of transcripts present within a particular sample and can be used to calculate gene expression based on absolute transcript abundance  <cit> . this technology has also been used to investigate the gene expression profile during adventitious rooting. wei et al.  reported  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes, including  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes, in tea cuttings  treated with iba. the genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, secondary metabolism, cell wall organization, and glutathione metabolism potentially contribute to adventitious rooting  <cit> .

mung bean is one of the most important tropical grain legumes that serves as a significant and a cheap source of carbohydrates and easily digestible protein for the people of asia and africa but is also increasingly extending into australia, usa, canada and ethiopia  <cit> . furthermore, this plant has been widely used as a model plant species to study physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms involved in the process of adventitious root formation . this provides an ideal experimental system with which to study the entire process of root formation, including the pre-morphogenesis stages  <cit> . in our previous studies, we had demonstrated that iba has a great effect on promoting adventitious rooting in mung bean seedlings  <cit> . recently, we had characterized the mung bean transcriptome and the differentially expressed gene profile and metabolic pathways during early stage  of adventitious root development in the hypocotyl cuttings without auxin treatment using rna-seq technology  <cit> . in the present study, rna-seq technology was exploited to highlight global changes in gene expression in response to iba during the induction  and initiation  stages of root development in mung bean hypocotyl cuttings. we aimed to perform gene profiling, characterize the metabolic pathways specifically regulated by iba and further to uncover the molecular basis of iba promoting adventitious rooting. real-time quantitative pcr was used to validate several of the transcriptional changes observed.

RESULTS
illumina solexa rna paired-end sequencing and mapped reads
to provide a comprehensive overview of mung bean and adventitious rooting in the seedlings at a transcriptional level, five cdna libraries were constructed and sequenced from the hypocotyl tissues of 5 day-old seedlings harvested separately at 0 h , after primary root excision and incubation in water for 6 h  or 10 μm iba for 6 h , and after primary root excision and incubation in water for 24 h  or iba for 24 h  , of which, the con, wat <dig>  and wat <dig> were previously sequenced in our previous study  <cit> . the sequencing data and mapping results of the cdna libraries of iba <dig> and iba <dig> were listed in additional file  <dig> and table  <dig>  on average, 94 % of the quality filter passed reads generated for all five samples was mapped uniquely to the reference sequences. data analysis showed that the amounts of raw reads and clean reads were increased by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at stage  <dig>  respectively, and increased by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at stage  <dig>  respectively, reflecting a great increase in the number of sequences resulting from iba treatment.fig.  <dig> time course of adventitious root development in mung bean hypocotyls after the primary root excision. adventitious root primordia are visible at 48 h after primary root excision, and adventitious roots grow through the epidermis of the hypocotyls within 96 h. the basal  <dig>  cm of the hypocotyls at 0 h, 6 h , and 24 h  after primary root excision and treatment with water or 10 μm iba were harvested and used as study samples



de novo assembly, unigene determination and abundance measurement
the paired-end de novo assembly of the processed reads was performed using the trinity transcriptome assembly software program, which can recover more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels and provides a unified, sensitive solution for transcriptome reconstruction in species without a reference genome, similar to methods that rely on genome alignments  <cit> . the chrysalis cluster module of trinity was used to cluster the transcripts and generated a total of  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> . the ratios of expressed unigenes were  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  % , and  <dig>  %  in wat <dig>  iba <dig>  wat <dig>  and iba <dig>  respectively. these results indicate that the amounts of unigenes expressed at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> were increased by  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively. clearly, iba enhanced the number of genes expressed during the early stages of rooting .

to evaluate the abundances of the expressed unigenes, gene expression levels were estimated from illumina sequencing based on the number of clean reads for a gene. the rpkm method  <cit>  was used to calculate the expression abundances of unigenes in each sample. the results showed that the unigenes numbered with rpkm = 10- <dig> were significantly increased by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig>  the unigenes numbered with rpkm = 500- <dig> were significantly increased by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig>  these results suggest that the expression abundances of certain genes were greatly increased by iba treatment .

go enrichment analysis
to discern global patterns of differential transcript abundance over the time course, unigenes with contrasting significance at fdr <  <dig>  were further filtered to include only those with greater than 2-fold changes  in unigene abundance between the samples. unigenes meeting these criteria were clustered using blast2go software   <cit>  and wego software  <cit> . to evaluate the gos differentially regulated during the time course, the significantly up- and down-regulated gos were enriched between iba <dig> and con and between iba <dig> and con. the results showed that the up- and down-regulated enriched gos decreased by  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  at stage  <dig>  respectively, and increased by  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  at stage  <dig>  respectively. furthermore, the up- and down-regulated enriched gos decreased by  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively, from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  the down-regulated enriched gos were  <dig> -fold  higher than that of the up-regulated at stage  <dig>  while the down-regulated enriched gos were increased by  <dig>  %  compared to the up-regulated gos at stage  <dig> . these results indicate that the majority of gos were significantly down-regulated at stage  <dig>  suggesting iba treatment significantly down-regulated gene expression after 6 h of adventitious rooting. the results further suggest that profound cellular and metabolic reorganization occurs with 6 h of rooting.fig.  <dig> the distribution of go terms enriched in the sample pairs



the differentially regulated go subcategories are presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  in the group of up-regulated go terms, the percentages of differentially expressed genes  in most of the go subcategories at stage  <dig> were higher than those at stage  <dig> with the exceptions of nutrient reservoir activity and structural molecule activity in molecular function, suggesting that most of the degs were significantly up-regulated at 6 h after iba treatment. furthermore, the percentage of degs clustered into the categories of rhythmic process in biological process, extracellular region and extracellular region part in cellular component, and antioxidant activity, electron carrier activity, enzyme regulator activity, and nutrient reservoir activity in molecular function were strongly increased from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  in the group of down-regulated go terms, nearly equal percentages of degs in most of the subcategories were examined between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  with the exception of cell killing in biological process, extracellular matrix, extracellular region, and extracellular region part in cellular component, nutrient reservoir activity, and structural molecule activity in molecular function. in the subcategories of cell killing, extracellular matrix, extracellular region, and extracellular region part, the degs ratio at stage  <dig> was higher than that at stage  <dig>  whereas for nutrient reservoir activity and structural molecule activity, the degs ratio at stage  <dig> was lower than that at stage  <dig>  these results suggest that profound changes in biological function caused by iba occurred in go subcategories such as extracellular region, extracellular matrix, extracellular region part, antioxidant activity, electron carrier activity, cell killing, and structural molecule activity during early stages of iba-induced rooting.fig.  <dig> go enrichment for up-regulated unigenes

additional file  <dig> and table  <dig> list the top  <dig> significantly up- and down-regulated go categories during the iba-induced development process. the results revealed that the gos associated with auxin signaling, such as auxin mediated signaling pathway, cellular response to auxin stimulus, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to auxin stimulus, cellular response to hormone stimulus, and hormone-mediated signaling pathway, were significantly up-regulated both at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  the gos associated with ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, such as nucleolus, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, rrna metabolic process, rrna processing, ribosome, structural constituent of ribosome, ribosomal subunit, cytosolic ribosome, and translation, were significantly up-regulated at stage  <dig> but significantly down-regulated at stage  <dig>  the gos associated with photosynthesis, such as photosystem, photosynthesis, photosystem ii, and photosystem i, were significantly down-regulated at stage  <dig>  the gos for oxidoreductase activity and extracellular region were significantly down-regulated both at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  the go secondary cell wall biogenesis was down-regulated at stage  <dig>  while the go cell wall was up-regulated at stage  <dig>  the gos associated with photosynthesis, such as light reaction, photosystem, photosystem ii, and thylakoid, as well as cell wall, external encapsulating structure, and hydrolase activity , were significantly up-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  however, the gos associated with hormone pathway and signaling such as response to chemical stimulus, response to hormone stimulus, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, response to organic substance, cellular response to hormone stimulus, response to auxin stimulus, cellular response to endogenous stimulus, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity, were significantly down-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> table  <dig> top- <dig> significantly up- and down-regulated gos between the samples



kegg pathway enrichment analysis
to further determine which biological pathways were significantly  modulated during the process, kegg pathway enrichment was performed using the kegg automatic annotation server   <cit> . this analysis revealed that  <dig> and five pathways were enriched at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively. among these, five kos were significantly down-regulated and two kos were significantly up-regulated at stage  <dig>  suggesting that significant metabolic changes occur at the 6-h time point . further analysis indicated that the pathways of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes and plant hormone signal transduction were up-regulated both at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  and the pathway of pentose and glucuronate interconversions, which has a function in glucuronate and pectin degradation, was up-regulated at stage  <dig>  the significantly down-regulated kos at stage  <dig> included photosynthesis, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, while those at stage  <dig> were ribosome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, cutin, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism. when compared with stage  <dig>  photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, cell cycle, and ribosome were up-regulated, while plant hormone signal transduction, diterpenoid biosynthesis, aminobenzoate degradation, bisphenol degradation, glucosinolate biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism were down-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is required for suberin and lignin biosynthesis. the cutin pathway is involved in suberin and wax biosynthesis. flavonoids are a major class of plant secondary metabolites that serve multitude of functions, including as pigments and in antioxidant activity. the pathways of aminobenzoate degradation and bisphenol degradation have functions in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. these results indicate that the plant hormone signal transduction and ribosome biogenesis pathways were significantly up-regulated by iba treatment, photosynthesis activity was down-regulated at stage  <dig> but up-regulated at stage  <dig>  and plant hormone signal transduction was down-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  furthermore, the pectin degradation pathway was up-regulated and suberin, lignin and wax biosynthesis were down-regulated at both stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  suggesting the beginning of cell wall loosening from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  the secondary metabolism pathways, such as phenylpropanoids and associated flavonoids, might play important roles in iba-induced adventitious rooting. phenylpropanoids function in plant defense as inducible chemical barriers or as signaling molecules. the core phenylpropanoid pathway is organized from phenylalanine to an activated  cinnamic acid derivative, and the specific branch pathways lead to the formation of lignin, sinapate esters, condensed tannins, anthocyanins, coumarins, benzoic acids and flavonoids/isoflavonoids . the common derivatives from the phenylpropanoid pathway, specifically phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lignin  <cit> , are crucial regulators in cell division and differentiation  <cit>  and stimulate in vitro rooting  <cit> .table  <dig> top most significantly up- and down-regulated kos between the samples



global changes in differentially expressed genes  during adventitious rooting in response to iba
to examine a gene expression profile during rooting under iba treatment, the clean reads for a gene were mapped back to the assembled unigenes using bwa- <dig> . <dig> software. the number of reads mapped to each unigene was then counted and normalized using rpkm  <cit> . gene expression values were measured using the method described by degseq r package  <cit> . of these,  <dig> unigenes specifically with  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated,  <dig> unigenes with  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated, and  <dig> unigenes with  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated were differentially expressed  at stage  <dig>  stage  <dig>  and between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively. when compared with the control , the number of degs  exhibited the following trend: iba24 > iba6 > wat24 > wat <dig>  the degs number was increased by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and by  <dig>  % at stage  <dig>  clearly, iba treatment increased the number of degs. moreover, the down-regulated degs accounted for  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % in wat <dig>  iba <dig>  wat <dig>  and iba <dig>  respectively, indicating the dominance of significantly down-regulated degs during the adventitious rooting process. the up-regulated degs accounted for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively, and total degs was increased by  <dig>  % in iba <dig> compared with iba <dig>  this result indicates that iba treatment significantly up-regulated gene expression, and the greatest changes in gene expression occurred at the 6-h time point . further analysis revealed that the degs with 2 > log2 ≥  <dig> accounted for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively, and the degs with log2 ≥  <dig> accounted for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively. this indicates that the degs with 2- to 4-fold changes accounted for more than 60 % of the total, and there was no correlation between degs number and the time of iba treatment .fig.  <dig> the distribution of degs in the sample pairs



gene expression patterns in response to iba during the early stages of adventitious rooting
to gain insight into the gene expression patterns that occur in response to iba during adventitious rooting, transcript levels of annotated unigenes were compared between different developmental time-points as well as between treatments. after filtering out the unigenes designated as unknown, hypothetical protein, uncharacterized protein, predicted protein, and unnamed protein in the database, the most significantly and abundantly expressed degs with both rpkm >  <dig> and log2 >  <dig> were selected and are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

among the most significantly and abundantly expressed unigenes at stage  <dig>   <dig> degs with rpkm > <dig> were up-regulated 16- to 82-fold and  <dig> degs with rpkm > <dig> were up-regulated 8- to 16-fold. thirty seven degs with rpkm > <dig> were down-regulated 16- to 222-fold and  <dig> unigenes with rpkm > <dig> were down-regulated 8- to 16-fold. of those at stage  <dig>   <dig> degs with rpkm >  <dig> were up-regulated 16- to 63-fold and  <dig> degs with rpkm >  <dig> were up-regulated 8- to 16-fold. twenty three degs with rpkm >  <dig> were down-regulated 16- to 388-fold, and  <dig> degs with rpkm >  <dig> were down-regulated 8- to 16- fold. the changes in degs between stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> were further analyzed. thirty two degs with rpkm > <dig> were up-regulated 16- to 603-fold and  <dig> degs with rpkm > <dig> were up-regulated 8- to 16-fold at stage  <dig>  thirty eight degs with rpkm > <dig> were down-regulated 16- to 89-fold and  <dig> degs were down-regulated 8- to 16-fold at stage  <dig>  these degs can be clustered into  <dig> functional categories as detailed below.

auxin homeostasis and signaling
during stage  <dig>   <dig> genes including five iaa-amido synthetase gh <dig> genes , ten auxin-induced protein genes, and two auxin-responsive protein genes  were strongly up-regulated; only an iaa-amino acid hydrolase ilr1-like and an auxin-induced protein 5ng4-like gene were down-regulated. during stage  <dig>   <dig> genes including five gh <dig> genes, four auxin-induced protein genes, an auxin-responsive protein iaa12-like gene, and an auxin-binding protein abp19a-like gene were up-regulated; the hydrolase activity gene was down-regulated. when compared with stage  <dig>  the gene encoding for auxin-binding protein abp19a-like  was specifically up-regulated at stage  <dig>  sixteen auxin-induced protein genes were down-regulated. the gh <dig> gene family encodes iaa-amido synthetases that negatively regulate the levels of free iaa by conjugating iaa to amino acids. iaa-amino acid hydrolase hydrolyzes the amide bond between iaa and the conjugated amino acid to release active iaa. iaa-amino acid hydrolase coordinates with pin and gh3s to maintain auxin homeostasis in the adventitious roots  <cit> . the iba-induced overexpression of the gh <dig> genes and the iba-mediated repression of the iaa-amino acid hydrolase gene both in stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> suggest a reduction of free auxin and an increase in amino-iaa during the early stages of adventitious rooting. the auxin-induced overexpression of the gh3- <dig> gene was also investigated during the initiation of adventitious roots in both the hypocotyls and stems of arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, gh3s also control jasmonic acid  homeostasis by conjugating ja to amino acids. auxin controls ja homeostasis and stimulates adventitious rooting by inducing gh <dig> expression, leading to an increase in ja conjugation and a reduction in free ja levels. this signaling pathway fine-tunes adventitious root initiation in arabidopsis hypocotyls  <cit> . an additional auxin receptor, abp <dig> , rapidly mediates cellular auxin effects via a non-transcriptional auxin response pathway and is essential for early auxin responses  <cit> . the specifically up-regulated abp19a-like gene indicates that the mediation of abp in rapid auxin signaling occurred in stage  <dig>  moreover, genes encoding auxin-induced proteins were down-regulated in stage  <dig>  which may result in the initiation of auxin signaling due to the derepression of arfs during stage  <dig> 

ethylene pathway-related degs
during stage  <dig>  eight genes, including three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase  genes , three ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1b-like genes , a s-adenosylmethionine  decarboxylase proenzyme-like gene, and a l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase gene, were up-regulated; an acc oxidase  homolog 1-like gene was down-regulated. no degs were selected with the setting criteria during stage  <dig>  when compared with stage  <dig>  the genes for an ethylene-responsive transcription factor lep-like and an ethylene receptor were up-regulated; genes coding for an acs, two aco , two ethylene-responsive transcription factor 15-like , and a l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase were down-regulated. s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase are involved in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, acs converts sam to acc, and then aco converts acc to ethylene  <cit> . this result indicates that iba significantly up-regulates the expression of acs and subsequently promotes ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . ethylene biosynthesis and perception and ethylene–auxin crosstalk are required for adventitious root formation  <cit> . auxin promotes ethylene biosynthesis by up-regulating the expression of several acs genes  <cit> , thereby increasing ethylene levels  <cit> . ethylene positively regulates iaa synthesis and promotes polar auxin transport and accumulation via aux <dig> .

cytokinin pathway-related degs
several genes involved in the cytokinin biosynthesis pathway, including two cytokinin riboside 5’-monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase genes  and a cytokinin dehydrogenase 3-like gene, were down-regulated during stage  <dig> compared with stage  <dig>  cytokinin has been known to be a negative regulator of adventitious rooting via its negative regulation of auxin  <cit> . iba-induced adventitious rooting might be related to the inhibition of cytokinin synthesis by iba in this study.

transcription factors
during stage  <dig>  nine genes including a lob <dig> gene, a lob <dig> gene, two protein sombrero-like genes , three homeobox-leucine zipper protein athb-like genes , a wrky  72-like gene, and a bhlh  135-like gene were highly up-regulated; six genes including a myb <dig> 13-like gene, a myb-related protein 308-like gene, a bhlh18-like gene, a transcription factor cpc gene, and a lob 21-like gene were down-regulated. during stage  <dig>  genes encoding lob domain proteins such as lob 12-like, lob 16-like, lob 18-like, and lob 29-like were up-regulated; a myb113-like gene was down-regulated. when compared with stage  <dig>  genes coding for a scr -like protein 28-like and a mads-box transcription factor 1-like were up-regulated, and genes coding for bhlh137-like, bee 3-like, and nac  72-like were down-regulated at stage  <dig>  sombrero-like genes encoding nam  family proteins modulate meristems and primordial development and promote the expression of genes involved in secondary cell walls biosynthesis  <cit> . scr genes in the gras family are known to be involved in meristem maintenance and root meristem initiation in adventitious root primordia  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of these genes is induced by exogenous auxin in the rooting-competent cuttings of two distantly related forest species, pinus radiata and castanea sativa, during the early stage leading to adventitious root formation  <cit> .

cell wall modification
during stage  <dig>  seven genes including two expansin precursor genes , two udp-glucosyltransferase genes , a nonsymbiotic hemoglobin gene, a cationic peroxidase 1-like gene, and a cytokinin induced message gene were up-regulated;  <dig> genes including three genes of fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein , five genes encoding cellulose synthase , three genes encoding glycosyl transferase family protein , a cobra-like protein gene, an organ-specific protein s2-like gene, a lectin gene, and a polygalacturonase non-catalytic subunit jp650-like gene were down-regulated. expansins have been demonstrated to be induced in hypocotyl bases during the early stages of adventitious root induction in pinus taeda and function in the loosening of cellulose and hemicellulose  <cit> . the cytokinin-induced message protein, which belongs to expansin family protein, is considered to be involved in cell wall loosening  <cit> . cationic peroxidase has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of lignin and suberin  <cit> . polygalacturonase is one of the pectin lyase associated with the degradation of the pectin network in the plant cell wall  <cit> . the ortholog of fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein of arabidopsis may be a cell surface adhesion protein that is required for normal cell expansion and is involved in cell wall biogenesis and organization  <cit> . cobra-like protein is involved in cellulose microfibril organization  <cit> . therefore, our results indicate that the process of cell wall loosening was significantly up-regulated, whereas the process of cell wall synthesis was suppressed by iba after 6 h of treatment.

during stage  <dig>   <dig> genes associated with cell wall loosening including two expansin genes , two protein sombrero-like genes , a galactoside 2-alpha-l-fucosyltransferase-like, a polygalacturonase-like, a pectate lyase 8-like, a cytokinin-induced message, two cationic peroxidase 1-like genes , and a burp domain-containing protein 3-like were up-regulated;  <dig> genes associated with cell wall synthesis including six cellulose synthase a catalytic subunit  <dig> genes , four genes encoding casparian strip membrane protein  , three fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein genes , a xylosyltransferase 1-like gene, a lectin gene, an organ-specific protein s2-like gene, a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein 32-like genes, a udp-galactose transporter 2-like gene, a cobra-like protein 4-like gene, a laccase-3-like gene, and a mannan endo- <dig> -beta-mannosidase 4-like gene were down-regulated during stage  <dig> 

when compared with stage  <dig>  putative expansin-a17-like  was specifically up-regulated at stage  <dig>  seventeen genes including three polygalacturonase pg <dig> genes , two endoglucanase , a galactoside 2-alpha-l-fucosyltransferase-like gene, two udp-glucosyltransferase family protein , an acidic endochitinase, a rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme 1-like, a soyasaponin iii rhamnosyltransferase, two glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase-like , and two extensin-like proteins  were up-regulated; nine genes including a lignin-forming anionic peroxidase-like, two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase , two udp-glycosyltransferase 83a1-like , a beta-glucosidase 47-like, a cellulose synthase-like protein e1-like, an expansin-like b1-like, and an acetyltransferase gene were down-regulated.

of these, sombrero-like genes are involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . burp domain-containing protein 3-like has polygalacturonase activity that is involved in auxin polar transport and cell wall organization  <cit> . the gene laccase-3-like is involved in the lignin degradation and detoxification of lignin-derived products  <cit> . casparian strip membrane proteins  have recently been shown to form membrane scaffolds and direct the local modification of the cell wall in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the gene galactose oxidase-like is involved in lignin degradation pathways. the snakin-1-like protein and acidic endochitinase are members of the glycoside hydrolase  family and potentially participate in cellulose catabolic processes and cell wall loosening  <cit> . the galactoside 2-alpha-l-fucosyltransferase-like gene is involved in cell wall biogenesis. extensin-like protein is a member of the leucine-rich repeat  family protein and serves as structural constituent of the cell wall  <cit> . acetyltransferase plays a role in the cutin biosynthetic process  <cit> . in summary, these results suggest that most of the genes associated with cell wall loosening were strongly induced by iba at stage  <dig>  while genes with the potential to be active in cell wall synthesis were repressed by iba in stage  <dig>  conversely, the majority of genes involved in cell wall weakening began to be down-regulated and most of the genes participating in cell wall synthesis were highly up-regulated by iba in stage  <dig>  these results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which iba promotes adventitious rooting is the effective regulation of the expression of genes associated with cell wall loosening and remodeling.

in the group of ethylene-related genes, a total of  <dig> genes, with  <dig> up-regulated  <dig> - to 42-fold and two down-regulated, and a total of  <dig> genes, with eight up-regulated 2- to 18-fold and three down-regulated, were identified at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  respectively. compared with stage  <dig>  there were a total of  <dig> genes, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, at stage  <dig>  genes coding for an acs and an ethylene receptor were up-regulated both at stage  <dig> and stage 2; however, genes coding for an acc oxidase, an acs, and three ap2/erfs were down-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  ethylene biosynthesis has been demonstrated to be required for adventitious root formation, and there is crosstalk between ethylene and auxin during the process of adventitious root formation  <cit> . these results suggest that genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling were up-regulated by iba treatment. it appears that iba-induced ethylene production may be a factor involved in the stimulation of adventitious rooting  <cit> .

five cytokinin-related genes were detected. of these, a cytokinin-induced message coding gene was up-regulated both at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig>  while four genes coding for enzymes involved in cytokinin synthesis were down-regulated at stage  <dig> and from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  exogenous application of iba greatly inhibited genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis  <cit> .

transcription factor  encoding genes were significantly regulated by iba during the process of adventitious rooting
to further understand the roles of transcription factors in regulating the early stages of rooting, the expression levels of a total of  <dig>  tf coding genes that were differentially expressed in the samples were analyzed. among these,  <dig> tf genes were significantly expressed with fold-changes > <dig>  of which  <dig> tf genes with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated were detected at stage  <dig>   <dig> tf genes with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated were detected at stage  <dig>  and  <dig> tf genes with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated were detected in stage  <dig> versus stage  <dig>  the majority were from tf families such as auxin-response factors , indoleacetic acid-induced protein , lob , myb , myc , bhlh , wrky , nac , apetala <dig> and ethylene-responsive element binding proteins , hsf , homeobox leucine protein , zinc finger protein , dof , basic leucine zipper , c2h <dig> , and e2f .

the ap2/erf, myb, nac, wrky, and bhlh families were found to be significantly expressed during early stages of adventitious root formation in poplar, and the myb and ap2/erf families were the most highly modulated transcription factors  <cit> . among the six ap/erf genes detected, an ethylene-responsive transcription factor 4-like was up-regulated at stage  <dig> and five genes were down-regulated at stage  <dig>  ap2/erfs have been shown to regulate a number of developmental processes  <cit> . ap2/erf families were the most highly modulated transcription factors during iba-induced adventitious rooting  <cit> . they have been shown to be key endogenous regulators of adventitious rooting in poplar  <cit> .

in the bhlh family, two genes  were up-regulated at stage  <dig> and two genes  were up-regulated at stage  <dig> and from stage  <dig> to stage 2; however, bhlh <dig> was down-regulated at stage  <dig> and from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  in the myb family, myb <dig> was down-regulated at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> but up-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig> were down-regulated at stage  <dig> or stage  <dig> but up-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  myb <dig> was down-regulated at stage  <dig> and from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  in the nac family, six nac domain protein coding genes  were down-regulated at stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> with the exception of vr <dig>  which was up-regulated from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  eight zinc finger protein genes were down-regulated at stage  <dig> or stage  <dig> and from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  in addition, a wrky  <dig> gene was down-regulated 32-fold at stage  <dig>  a wuschel-related homeobox  gene, which encodes an auxin-inducible transcription factor that is highly responsive to auxin and is specifically expressed in quiescent center  maintenance and the root apical meristem   <cit> , was up-regulated at stage  <dig>  suggesting the occurrence of ram formation in stage  <dig>  these results indicate that the majority of bhlh transcription factors were up-regulated, while the majority of mybs, nacs, zinc finger proteins, and wrky were down-regulated by iba treatment during the early stages of adventitious rooting.

validation of gene expression using qrt-pcr
to validate the differential expression data obtained through statistical comparison of rpkm values, a total of  <dig> interesting degs of five types were identified:  <dig> auxin signaling-related genes,  <dig> stress response-related genes, three lbd genes, and two myb genes. these genes were selected for validation of the transcriptomic data using real-time quantitative pcr . detailed information on these genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  based on the rna-seq results and the study published by jian et al.  <cit> , we selected three genes, cpy <dig>  eif5a, and actin , as internal reference genes for qrt-pcr experiments. the qrt-pcr results showed that cpy <dig> was the most stable housekeeping gene, so it was used to calculate the relative expression levels in this study. the expression levels of all the genes measured by qrt-pcr showed a strong correlation to the rna-seq data . the correlation analysis between the rna-seq and qrt-pcr data showed that the correlation coefficient of  <dig> of the  <dig> data sets is r >  <dig> . during two time points for adventitious rooting, the expression levels of seven arf family genes exhibited significantly decreasing trends both in the water and iba treatments, but they were significantly up-regulated by iba, with the exception of arf <dig> and arf <dig>  compared with the controls. the four iaa  family genes, four aux family genes, and one pin gene were significantly up-regulated at 6 h both in the water and iba treatments and were significantly induced by iba. the lbd <dig> and lbd <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated by iba at two time points. the two genes myb <dig> and myb <dig> exhibited sharp decreases at two time points and a slight increase at 24 h compared with 6 h, but their expression levels were up-regulated by iba at 6 h. the four nac family genes were significantly up-regulated by iba at 6 h compared with the controls. the genes ahk <dig>  and ahk <dig> were significantly up-regulated by iba at two time points. the genes cationic peroxidase  <dig>  and per <dig> exhibited large increases at two time points but were less affected by iba treatment. the gene quinone oxidoreductase-like protein  was strongly up-regulated by iba at 6 h. the arf transcription factors mediate auxin signaling at the transcriptional level by regulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. the lbd genes contain at least one auxin-responsive element  and are involved in auxin-mediating development processes. several members of the lob-domain transcription factors have been identified and shown to mediate adventitious rooting  <cit> . both lbd <dig> and lbd <dig> were up-regulated by auxin during adventitious rooting in arabidopsis hypocotyls and stems  <cit> . the aux family genes have also been shown to be essential for adventitious root formation  <cit> . nac transcription factors have been reported to contribute to various developmental processes, such as shoot apical meristem  development  <cit> , lateral root development  <cit> , and secondary wall formation  <cit> . moreover, nac genes are also involved in responses to stress, such as drought and high salinity  <cit> . ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  and ahk <dig> have been identified as cytokinin receptors and are involved in the water stress response during the early vegetative stages of plant growth and regulation of meristem development  <cit> . arabidopsis mutants lacking ahk <dig>  ahk <dig>  and ahk <dig> exhibit enhanced adventitious root growth  <cit> . the quinone oxidoreductase-like protein , also known as nadh dehydrogenase, which is a zinc-binding dehydrogenase, is involved in the electron transport chain, photorespiration, and redox process. therefore, our results confirmed that iba can not only enhance the expression of several auxin signaling control genes such as arfs, aux/iaas, and pins, as well as several genes from the lob and myb transcription factor families, but can promote the expression of various stress response-related genes such as nac, ahks, and qorl to further increase the stress tolerance of the cells, thus leading to efficient adventitious rooting.fig.  <dig> validation of selected genes involved in adventitious rooting by qrt-pcr. the gene expression levels measured by qrt-pcr were compared with that of rna-seq. the data of con, wat  <dig>  and wat  <dig> in the figure are the same as our previous study published recently  <cit> . white histograms represent expression levels determined by rna-seq in rpkm units , while gray columns represent gene expression levels determined by qrt-pcr and normalized to control genes . bars represent the mean  of three experiments. different letters  represent statistically significant differences  among the qrt-pcr data, analyzed using student’s t-test



CONCLUSIONS

plant material and culture conditions
mung bean  seeds were washed in distilled water, surface-sterilized in a 6 % naclo solution for 15 min and rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. the seeds were subsequently germinated under a thin layer of sterilized perlite in petri dishes in a growth chamber at 25 ± 1 °c for 36 h in the dark and then at 25 ± 1 °c with a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod under white fluorescent lamps . after five days of growth, seedlings that were 5 cm in height were used for the experiments. the primary roots of the seedlings were removed from the bases of the hypocotyls, and the resulting seedlings were incubated in 50-ml beakers , each containing 40 ml of sterilized distilled water or 10 μm iba for  <dig> to 24 h under the same aseptic conditions applied to the seedling culture. the 5-mm-long basal region of each hypocotyl, where adventitious roots develop in vitro, was cut and collected separately at the  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h incubation time points, and the harvested samples were separately designated as con, wat <dig>  iba <dig>  wat <dig>  and iba <dig> . three biological replicates, each consisting of ten stem cutting bases, were collected per treatment and time point, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °c until further analysis.

total rna extraction, cdna library preparation and illumina sequencing
approximately 50 mg of tissue that was fully ground in liquid nitrogen was mixed with 600 μl of buffer rlysis-p  in a  <dig> -ml rnase-free tube for 5 min in a water bath at 65 °c to ensure sufficient lysis. next, 60 μl of buffer pca  was added and mixed thoroughly, and the mixture was incubated at -20 °c for 3 min. after the mixture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min at 4 °c, an equal volume of cooled phenol chloroform  was added to the supernatant, mixed, and then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min at 4 °c. an equal volume of cooled chloroform was added to the supernatant and mixed. after the sample was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 5 min at 4 °c, an equal volume of cooled isopropanol was added to the supernatant, shaken gently, and left to precipitate for 10 min. after the sample was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 20 min at 4 °c, the pellet was recovered, washed twice with 75 % ethanol, dried for 5–15 min at ambient temperature, dissolved in 50 μl of rnase-free water, and stored at -80 °c. the resulting rna integrity was quantified with rna integrity number  values of  <dig> - <dig>  using a  <dig> bioanalyzer , and rna concentration was determined using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer.

poly  mrnas were enriched from the equal amounts of total rna from each sample using oligo  <dig> beads  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the purified mrna was fragmented using the fragment mix reactive system at 94 °c for 4 min. the reaction system for first-strand cdna synthesis was composed of superscript ii reverse transcriptase , first strand master mix, random hexamer primers, and the fragmented mrna templates. the reaction conditions were as follows: 25 °c for 10 min, 42 °c for 50 min, and 70 °c for 15 min, with a final hold at 4 °c. second-strand cdna was synthesized using second strand master mix . after synthesis, the dscdna fragments were purified with agencourt ampure xp beads , and the 3’ ends were repaired using end repair control, followed by purification with ampure xp beads. subsequently, klenow exo  was used to perform adenylation of the 3’ ends of the cdna fragments. after end repair and a-tailing, illumina paired-end adapters were ligated to the cdna fragments using t <dig> ligase  and purified twice with ampure xp beads. last, selective pcr was used to enrich and amplify the ligated cdna for cdna library construction. the pcr procedure was performed as follows: 98 °c for 30 s; 15 cycles of 98 °c for 10 s, 60 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 5 min; holding at 4 °c, followed by purification with ampure xp beads. the quality and quantity of the cdna library were confirmed using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer and qubit  <dig>  . paired-end sequencing of the constructed cdna library was performed at sangon biotech. co. ltd.  on an illumina hiseq  <dig> system .

de novo assembly and sequence clustering
after the raw sequence processing, the clean reads were de novo assembled using the trinity paired-end assembly method  <cit> . the assembled sequences were clustered with chrysalis. the longest sequences that could not be extended on either end within each clustered loci were obtained and defined as unigenes. the unigenes were subjected to similarity alignment against protein and nucleotide sequence databases using blastx locally installed blast+ v <dig> . <dig> software  <cit>  and megablast, respectively, at an e-value cut-off of e- <dig>  blast annotations were filtered using either subject or query coverage  and sequence identity . the assembled unigenes were deposited in the transcriptome shotgun assembly sequence database  at ddbj/embl/genbank under the sequence read archive srr  <dig> and the accession numbers gbxo01000001-gbxo <dig> 

mapping reads, expression analysis and deg confirmation
due to the lack of a reference sequence, the assembled transcripts were assumed the reference sequence. to compute unigene expression levels, the sequences were aligned against the reference transcript sequences  <cit> . the expression levels of unigenes were measured by mapping back the number of clean reads to the assembled unigenes using bwa- <dig> .2-http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/ in the end-to-end alignment mode  <cit> . the number of clean reads mapped to each unigene was calculated and then normalized to rpkm  using erange <dig>  software  <cit> . unigene expression levels were analyzed using the degseq r package  <cit>  with the mars  model. the degs between each pair of samples were screened using the audic-claverie algorithm  <cit>  with an fdr threshold of ≤ <dig>  and an absolute value of log2 ≥  <dig>  multiple test corrections for the p-value and fdr were performed with the benjamini-hochberg correction  <cit> . to gain insight into the differential expression of genes specifically induced by iba at each time point, the analyses were performed between iba <dig> and wat <dig> and between iba <dig> and wat <dig>  as well as iba <dig> relative to iba <dig>  and were represented as stage  <dig>  stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  respectively.

functional annotation and classification
all resulting unigenes were annotated according to their sequence similarity to previously annotated genes. first, the unigenes were aligned to the public protein databases nr, swiss-prot, trembl, pfam, and cdd using blastx with similarity set at >30 % and an e-value ≤ 1e- <dig>  the kog  and kegg  pathway annotations were performed by sequence comparisons against the two databases using blastall and kaas software  with an e-value ≤ 1e- <dig>  the resulting blast hits were processed using blast2go software   <cit>  with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> to retrieve associated go terms. wego software was used for achievement of go classification  <cit> . the results that presented the best alignment were used to identify the sequence direction and to predict the coding regions using blastx searches against protein databases, with the priority order of nr, swiss-prot, kegg and kog if conflicting results were obtained. the estscan software  <cit>  was used to analyze the unigenes that did not align to any of the above databases. kegg mapping was used to determine the metabolic pathways. kegg pathways were retrieved from the kegg web server  . to further enrich the pathway annotations, unigenes were submitted to the kegg automatic annotation server   <cit> , and the single-directional best-hit information method was selected. to identify the enriched pathways, the phyper test was used to measure the relative coverage of the annotated kegg orthologous groups of a pathway against the transcriptome background, and the pathways with a p-value ≤  <dig>  were classified as enriched.

quantitative reverse transcription pcr validation
to validate the rna-seq data, we selected  <dig> genes that were shown to be involved in adventitious root development for q-pcr analysis. pcr samples were harvested from the hypocotyls of three biological replicates under the same conditions as the samples subjected to illumina sequencing. total rna was extracted using trizol reagent  and purified on rneasy mini spin columns  with on-column dnase i treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. rna integrity was examined with an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> . first-strand cdna was synthesized using an amv first strand cdna synthesis kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the gene-specific primer pairs were designed using primer premier  <dig>  software  according to the confirmed sequences . real-time pcr was run using a lightcycler  <dig> ii  and abi sybr green pcr master mix . reactions were subjected to the following conditions: 95 °c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 40 s. a melting curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the primer specificity for each primer set to verify the presence of a single melting peak after amplification. ‘no cdna’ samples  and ‘no rt’ samples were included as negative controls. all reactions were performed with three independent biological replicates, and the expression levels calculated for each sample were based on three technical replicates. output data were generated with sequence detector version  <dig> . <dig> software . the relative expression levels of the selected genes were calculated in relation to the reference gene using the comparative threshold cycle method with the delta-delta ct method  <cit> . statistical analyses were conducted with student’s t-tests at the p <  <dig>  level of significance. the expression levels of all the genes measured by qrt-pcr showed a strong correlation to the rna-seq data.
