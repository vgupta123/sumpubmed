BACKGROUND
polygenic resistance frequently contributes to partial but presumably more durable levels of resistance in cultivated crops  <cit>  and is a major target for many breeding programs. pressure to reduce chemical applications and frequent breakdown of major resistance genes in plant species encourage the integration of polygenic resistance into cultivars of many crops. polygenic resistance is controlled by many quantitative trait loci , which express minor to major effects and whose functional roles are usually poorly understood  <cit> . the combined and diversified use of multiple major or minor-effect resistance genes should result in both increasing levels of resistance  <cit>  and in limiting the adaptation of pathogen populations to plant genetic resistances  <cit> . the mining of diverse loci and gene functions controlling polygenic resistance, combined and deployed together with available major resistance genes, is expected to be a key strategy for durably improving plant genetic resistance to pathogens. a depth knowledge of the diversity of qtl controlling polygenic resistance among genetic resources of cultivated crop species is necessary for long-term genetic improvement. st-clair  <cit>  reviewed diversity studies of resistance qtl in several bi-parental populations from multiple germplasm sources and the subsequent use of marker-assisted-selection  for diverse resistance qtl. linkage mapping in multi-parental population  <cit>  and association mapping in connected recombinant inbred lines or natural populations  <cit>  have been developed for more powerful detection and comparison of positive alleles among a wider diversity of genotypes than in previous studies. whole genome sequencing data in conjunction with genome-wide association genetics has been shown a promising approach to investigate the diversity of disease resistance qtl in plants and to detect with high resolution common resistance alleles in a given population  <cit> . qtl meta-analysis  <cit>  have also been shown a useful approach to obtain a synthetic representation of the diversity of loci controlling a trait of interest in plants. it consists of combining results from previous qtl reports into consensus genomic regions, or meta-qtl, associated with the trait variation. the position of these meta-qtl is estimated with higher accuracy compared to position estimates of individual qtl. statistical methods for meta-analysis of qtl have been implemented in two main software packages, biomercator  <cit>  and meta-qtl  <cit> . this approach has recently been applied in plants  <cit>  and is especially useful for obtaining an overview of loci and for increasing resolution to identify candidate genes controlling polygenic resistance  <cit> .

aphanomyces root rot, caused by the soilborne oomycete aphanomyces euteiches drech., is one of the most damaging pea diseases worldwide  <cit>  and is a major limiting factor to pea production in france. the absence of adequate chemical or cultural methods to manage the disease requires development of pea cultivars with acceptable levels of resistance to sustain pea production. in pea, resistance to a. euteiches has been shown to be partial, polygenically inherited  <cit>  and correlated with undesirable traits such as long internods, anthocyanin production and late-flowering  <cit>  . previous exploration studies of diversity within pisum for resistance to a. euteiches reported that sources of resistance were scarce  <cit>  . the few sources of resistance identified, were integrated into pea breeding programs for root rot resistance over the past 30 years. these programs resulted in the release of germplasm with acceptable agronomic characteristics and increased levels of partial resistance in the usa  <cit>  and in france  <cit> . in the past 10 years, a collaborative french-american research program conducted genetic dissection of polygenic resistance to a. euteiches in four main sources of resistance  derived from and/or integrated into various breeding programs. these sources of resistance showed the highest and/or most stable levels of resistance across several different field locations in france and in the usa. they presented different genealogies  <cit> , except pi <dig> and 90– <dig> which were related  <cit>  but differed in their levels of resistance. results from this collaborative program have been reported for three mapping populations  <cit> . from a ril population derived from the cross puget  × 90– <dig> ,  <dig> qtl were associated with aphanomyces root rot resistance, including three qtl  that were detected over various environments and isolates  <cit> . in two ril populations derived from crosses between the susceptible variety baccara and the resistant germplasm lines pi <dig> and  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genomic regions controlling partial resistance to a. euteiches were identified. these regions included five highly stable regions across environments , isolates and genetic background, as well as  <dig> epistatic interactions  <cit> . qtl results obtained from a fourth ril population derived from the cross between dsp  and 90– <dig>  are reported in this manuscript along with qtl comparisons between the independent mapping studies. this comparison will provide a more complete view of the diversity of aphanomyces resistance loci available from the four sources of resistance. greater understanding of the resistance qtl will allow qtl pyramiding and diversification strategies to be developed, in an effort to prevent the pathogen from overcoming the crucial and limited level of resistance. comparisons between aphanomyces resistance qtl and qtl controlling other agronomic traits will aid selection for positive associations and avoid selection of negative linkages between resistance and undesirable alleles.

the objectives of this study are  to provide an overview of the diversity and the structural genomic organization of qtl involved in resistance to a. euteiches in pea, by compiling qtl mapping data obtained from four main sources of resistance,  to identify positive and negative co-segregations between aphanomyces resistance alleles and alleles controlling morphological and phenological traits and  to identify putative candidate genes underlying reduced confidence intervals of main meta-qtl using pea-m. truncatula translational genomics. we conducted a meta-analysis of qtl for resistance to a. euteiches in pea integrating  qtl previously detected for resistance to a. euteiches from three resistance sources   <cit>  and  qtl reported for the first time in this study from the additional source of resistance, 90– <dig>  we also performed a meta-analysis of qtl controlling morphological and phenological traits , from phenotypic data and qtl results obtained in three of the four ril populations studied for aphanomyces resistance. finally, we compared genomic localizations of the identified morphological and phenological meta-qtl to the ones of aphanomyces resistance meta-qtl. we identified candidate genes underlying main resistance meta-qtl using the pea-m. truncatula translational toolkit of bordat et al. <cit> .

RESULTS
genetic analysis of resistance to a. euteiches in the dsp × 90– <dig> ril population
the genetic map, constructed from the dsp × 90– <dig> ril population, was comprised of a total of  <dig> markers, including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> rapds, three genes of known-function  and two morphological markers  distributed over nine linkage groups  . the map covered 1046 cm kosambi, corresponding to about 77% of the pea ssr reference genetic map  <cit> . five of the  <dig> markers  showed significant distorsion from the expected mendelian ratio . of the  <dig> markers,  <dig> , equally distributed over nine lg, were common to the pea reference genetic map  <cit> , including  <dig> ssr,  <dig> rapd and one morphological marker . these common markers were ordered with high colinearity between the two genetic maps, except in the distal part of lgiib, where the order of a block of markers was inverted. compared to the reference map, the distal part of lgi and the pericentromeric regions of lgii and lgiii remain uncovered by markers on the dsp × 90– <dig> map.

analysis of the dsp × 90– <dig> ril resistance data in controlled conditions showed that the five pea lines used as controls ranked as expected for root rot index  scores with all but one of the six a. euteiches strains, confirming the strain pathotypes as described in  <cit>  and  <cit>  . rri scores in the dsp × 90– <dig> rils showed highly significant genotypic and block effects  for each strain with the exception of ae <dig>  mean-based heritability of rri was moderate  to high . distribution of rri adjusted means in the ril population tended to fit a normal curve with each of the six strains except rb <dig> . lower levels of symptoms were observed in the ril population with the ae <dig> strain than with the five other strains . transgressive ril segregants with increased resistance and susceptibility compared to parental values were observed with each of the six strains.

analysis of the dsp x 90– <dig> ril resistance data in each of the  <dig> field environments studied showed highly significant genotypic effect  for all but two variables  and significant block effects  for half of the variables. mean-based heritabilities of traits, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , were low  for five variables, moderate  for nine variables and high  for six aerial decline index  variables . frequency distribution of the adjusted mean scores for each variable in the ril population tended to fit normal curves, with the exception of the adi scores obtained in pullman in  <dig> and  <dig> . differences were observed between means and ranges of the ril population for rri and adi variables, depending on the location and year. in all experiments, transgressive segregants, either more susceptible or more resistant than the parents, were observed.

half of the dsp × 90– <dig> ril phenotypic data from different field criteria and environments were significantly  and positively correlated with most of the other field data . data with low heritability values were mostly poorly correlated with the other field data . data from evaluations in controlled conditions for the six a. euteiches strains were highly correlated  with each other. the rb <dig> strain data was also positively and significantly correlated with most of the rri and adi scores assessed in french and american field conditions, contrary to the other strain data which were significantly correlated with few or no field scoring data.

a total of  <dig> additive-effect qtl, corresponding to  <dig> genomic regions distributed over nine linkage groups, were detected in the dsp × 90– <dig> ril population for aphanomyces root rot resistance evaluated in  <dig> field environments and with six strains in controlled conditions . a major qtl, aeps <dig> , previously identified in  <cit> , was consistently detected on lgvii from adi and/or rri data collected in the  <dig> field environments studied and for five of the six strains in controlled conditions. the ae-ps <dig>  genomic region covered about 35 cm and accounted for the majority of the phenotypic variation, yielding  <dig> % for resistance to the rb <dig> strain. two qtl, ae-ps <dig>  and ae-ps <dig> , previously identified  <cit> , were also consistently detected on lgiiia and lgv , especially from adi and/or rri field data  and from the six strain data in controlled conditions . five genomic regions on lgiv and lgvi , were consistently associated with three to five individual field and/or controlled condition resistance qtl. seventeen qtl, distributed on the seven lg, were less consistently identified from one or two variable of the same criterion. for the eight total genomic regions detected from at least three variables, no consistent specificities were observed across either environments or strains, except for the three regions that were more specifically identified from french field  or controlled condition  data. four of the eight regions  explained more than 15% of the phenotypic variation observed for at least one variable. resistance was contributed by 90– <dig> and dsp alleles, whatever the variable, at four  and two  of the eight regions, respectively. four significant pairwise epistatic interactions were identified for increasing resistance to a. euteiches, especially to the rb <dig> strain. all the interactions involved at least one minor qtl, especially ae-ps <dig>  .

genetic analysis of earliness and plant height from dsp × 90– <dig>  baccara × pi <dig> and baccara x  <dig> ril populations
analysis of variance of earliness and plant height data in each environment and population showed a significant genotypic effect  and no significant block effect  for all variables. mean-based heritabilities of the flowering traits  and plant height variables  evaluated in a three-block design were very high , except for flo <dig> assessed at dijon in  <dig> . frequency distributions of the flo and ht scores closely followed normal curves in the dsp × 90– <dig> and baccara ×  <dig> populations. flo distributions tended to fit bimodal curves in the baccara × pi <dig> population in most of the environments tested, despite the similar values of parental lines. the flo and ht scores were significantly  and negatively correlated with no, few and most aphanomyces resistance variable scorings in the baccara ×  <dig>  dsp × 90– <dig> and baccara × pi <dig> populations, respectively . flo and ht values were highly correlated in each population, across all environments .

a total of  <dig> additive-effect qtl corresponding to  <dig> genomic regions were detected for the flowering traits , from the three ril populations studied. additionally, three additive-effect qtl corresponding to three genomic regions were detected for plant height  . no co-localization was observed between genomic regions detected for flo and ht traits. four genomic regions were consistently detected for flo, each containing four to six individual qtl. three of them  explained up to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation while flo-ps <dig>  explained up to 10% of the variation. two other regions  were also identified, each containing two individual qtl. flo-ps <dig>  explained up to 40% of the phenotypic variation. among the six regions, alleles for earliness at flo-ps <dig> , flo-ps <dig>  and flo-ps <dig>  were contributed by baccara, while they were contributed by 90– <dig> at flo-ps <dig>  and pi <dig> or  <dig> at flo-ps <dig>  and flo-ps <dig> . eight flo qtl with minor effects , were specifically detected in one environment. the three qtl identified for plant height were detected with minor-effects, and at these loci, the 90– <dig> alleles contributed to shorter plants.

qtl meta-analysis and co-localisations between aphanomyces resistance and morphological/phenological meta-qtl
qtl meta-analysis of aphanomyces resistance and morphological/phenological traits was performed using three mapping studies in the four pea ril populations described in table  <dig>  the qtl mapping study conducted using the puget × 90– <dig> ril population  <cit>  was updated by adding  <dig> markers  to the genetic map. thirty five of the added markers were common to at least one of the two other individual genetic maps used. the updated puget × 90– <dig> genetic map, covering 1523 cm, comprised a total of  <dig> markers . individual qtl detected on the previous map  <cit>  were confirmed and the updated qtl information were used for the meta-analysis.

a composite interval mapping.

consensus map
the consensus marker map was established from the three individual genetic maps  using the meta-qtl software. the map comprised a total of  <dig> markers  and covered 1513 cm kosambi . eighty-six percent of the markers mapped to only one of the individual maps studied, while 14% mapped to two or three individual maps with consistent marker order and regular distribution on all lg  with exception of lgi. fifteen percent of the  <dig> markers of the consensus map were also mapped on the reference genetic map described by  <cit>  and had consistent positions between the two maps.

meta-qtl for resistance to a. euteiches
a total of  <dig> individual additive-effect qtl detected for resistance to a. euteiches in the three mapping studies were projected onto the consensus marker map . projection of all individual qtl allowed three to five main genomic regions per lg to be identified, each consisting of individual qtl with overlapping confidence intervals. removal of redundant or single-individual qtl left  <dig> independent qtl for the meta-analysis. meta-analysis identified  <dig> meta-qtl for resistance to a. euteiches distributed over the seven lg, with three to four meta-qtl per lg . each meta-qtl was comprised of  <dig>  to  <dig>  independent qtl  corresponding to one to  <dig> initial individual qtl . confidence intervals of meta-qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm , with a mean of  <dig>  ± 12 cm, and were lower than 20 cm for 85% of the meta-qtl. the average width of the independent qtl confidence intervals was reduced from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold , depending on the meta-qtl. among the  <dig> meta-qtl identified,  <dig> were highly consistent, including eight meta-qtl comprised of at least  <dig> initial individual qtl and three meta-qtl comprised of eight to  <dig> initial qtl . the remaining  <dig> less consistent meta-qtl aggregated individually between one and six initial qtl. the  <dig> consistent meta-qtl corresponded to ten independent genomic regions. in seven of these regions, initial qtl were clustered in highly consistent positions, namely on lgi , lgii , lgiii , lgiv , lgv  and lgvii . eight of the  <dig> consistent meta-qtl aggregated initial qtl detected from either three or four mapping populations, and all but one of the remaining meta-qtl were detected from two mapping populations. at each meta-qtl that contained initial qtl from at least two mapping populations, two to five parental alleles, mostly from the resistant parent, contributed to resistance with a mean of  <dig>  alleles per meta-qtl. five of the  <dig> meta-qtl comprised of initial qtl from at least two field environments were specific to either french  or usa  environments, while the remaining  <dig> were not environment-specific. all meta-qtl including initial qtl detected from controlled condition data co-located with initial qtl identified from at least one field environment. none of the meta-qtl comprised of a minimum of two initial controlled condition qtl, were specific to a single strain. eighty percent of the meta-qtl were not specific to root or aerial scoring criteria used in the different studies, even if some of them included initial qtl that were primarily detected from root criteria  or aerial criteria .

a meta-qtl names are coded as follows : mqtl-ae = meta-qtl detected for resistance to a. euteiches; mqtl-morpho = meta-qtl detected for morphological and phenological traits . on each linkage group , mqtl-ae and mqtl-morpho, which co-localize, are mentioned by asterisks. meta-qtl indicated in bold correspond to the seven main consistent genomic regions identified for resistance to a. euteiches.

meta-qtl for morphological/phenological traits and co-localizations with aphanomyces resistance meta-qtl
projection of  <dig> initial additive-effect qtl detected for earliness and plant height onto the consensus map outlined  <dig> distinct genomic regions with qtl clusters, including  <dig> redundant or single initial qtl. meta-analysis of the remaining  <dig> non-redundant initial qtl resulted in the identification of seven meta-qtl distributed over six lg . each meta-qtl was comprised of one to three independent qtl , corresponding to two to six initial individual qtl. confidence intervals of the meta-qtl ranged from  <dig>  to 28 cm and were reduced by  <dig> to  <dig>  times compared to mean confidence intervals of clustered initial qtl. the seven meta-qtl corresponded to the six most consistent flo genomic regions , and to a cluster of two flo and one ht overlapping qtl . five of the seven meta-qtl were identified from at least two populations and from diverse en-vironments.

based on the  <dig> meta-qtl that contained more than one initial qtl for either aphanomyces resistance or for plant earliness and height, six genomic regions were detected with overlapping intervals of resistance and phenological qtl . in the regions of meta-qtl co-localization, nine negative and five positive associations were found between parental alleles contributing to resistance and early flowering and/or short stature. positive associations involved  <dig>  pi <dig> and dsp alleles. pi <dig> and/or  <dig> alleles contributing to resistance and normal leaf type or anthocyanin production were in coupling phase in meta-qtl regions on lgi  and lgii . 90– <dig> and 90– <dig> alleles contributing to resistance and round seed type were also in coupling phase in the meta-qtl region on lgv .

identification of candidate genes underlying meta-qtl
using the pea-medicago truncatula translational toolkit of bordat et al. <cit> , a list of genes among  <dig> pea unigenes was identified as positional candidates within the support interval of all but one  of the seven highly consistent resistance meta-qtl regions. adjacent markers to the meta-qtl, which were common between the consensus marker map developed in this study and the pea functional map of  <cit> , were used to define intervals containing candidate genes established in  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes underlying main meta-qtl were identified, including  <dig> to  <dig> genes per meta-qtl . out of them,  <dig> were similar to genes with a putative function, among which 17% had a known-function related to plant disease resistance. these genes corresponded to resistance gene analogs  or genes involved in plant-pathogen recognition , genes involved in defense or signal transduction  and genes involved in resistance to other diseases. particularly, in meta-qtl regions with smallest confidence intervals, genes coding for lrr proteins  and protein kinases  could be suggested as good candidates. in the other meta-qtl regions, clusters of genes coding for heat shock proteins  and a plant disease response protein-encoding gene  were also striking putative candidates to the resistance.

discussion
a moderately low diversity of loci controls quantitative partial resistance to a. euteiches in four main sources of resistance in pea
this study is the first that provides an overview and comparison from multiple studies of genetic loci controlling resistance to a. euteiches in pea. it is one of the first reports developing a comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of disease resistance in cultivated legumes  <cit> . similar studies have proven valuable in other plant species for determining key resistance loci useful in mas and identifying candidate genes underlying resistance qtl  <cit> .

in this study,  <dig> individual qtl detected for aphanomyces resistance from eight variables collected in four pea ril populations over a total of  <dig> field environments  and  <dig> controlled condition assays  were analyzed for meta-analysis. a total of  <dig> meta-qtl were identified, including  <dig> consistent meta-qtl each containing more than eight initial individual qtl. seven main genomic regions clustering numerous initial qtl with high position consistency were highlighted. the number of consistent meta-qtl identified is quite low given the four diverse partially resistant pea lines studied and the complex inheritance of partial resistance to a. euteiches.

the meta-qtl analysis conducted in this study accurately compared genomic positions of individual qtl identified from different studies and refined the confidence intervals of the main genomic regions associated with resistance. the consensus map preserved marker order of individual maps based on 14% of common markers, and of the reference genetic map  <cit>  based on 15% of common markers. identification of over-reduced meta-qtl confidence intervals was minimized by clustering individual qtl using non-redundant independent qtl with confidence intervals estimated from their r <dig> values  <cit> . this approach resulted in the identification of three to four meta-qtl per lg, and their confidence intervals were reduced four-fold, on average, compared to mean confidence intervals of the initial independent qtl. confidence interval reduction was correlated to the number of clustered independent qtl available for refining each meta-qtl , as shown by the smallest confidence intervals  observed for the eight most consistent meta-qtl.

in contrast to previous similar meta-qtl studies of quantitative resistance  <cit> , few meta-qtl specificities were observed associated with the parental source of resistance. all but one meta-qtl clustering at least two of the initial qtl were detected in two, three or four mapping populations. each of these meta-qtl comprised of two to five alleles that contributed to the resistance. at a given meta-qtl, meta-analysis did not provide effect estimates of the different alleles, i.e. classification of alleles according to their effect levels. however, at several meta-qtl, variations in additive effects and r <dig> were observed between initial qtl detected from different ril populations. initial qtl detected from the dsp × 90– <dig> population at mqtl-ae <dig> had higher average additive effects and r <dig> values  than those detected from the baccara x pi <dig>  and baccara ×  <dig>  populations. this suggests that some parental alleles contributing to the resistance, generally detected with high consistency, could have stronger effects than others. multiple parental alleles associated with resistance at one meta-qtl could correspond to identical or different alleles of a single gene or to clusters of closely linked genes. despite the reduced confidence intervals obtained for several meta-qtl, fine mapping of meta-qtl will be required to determine the correct allele/gene hypothesis. according to pedigree information available in the literature, the four resistant germplasm studied are not independent and may share common resistance genes, which is supported by the low specificity of most of the meta-qtl identified in the ril populations. pi <dig> was one of the parents used in crosses to develop 90– <dig> but was not reported in the genealogy of 90– <dig>  which derived its resistance from mn <dig>  <cit> . little information is available about the parentage of  <dig>  which was derived from several recurrent selection cycles conducted by lewis and gritton  <cit> . the literature contains no data about genetic distances between the sources of resistance to a. euteiches used. however, in our study,  <dig> meta-qtl underlied different combinations of resistance alleles from two of the four resistant parent, frequently including  <dig> alleles, and nine meta-qtl included resistance alleles derived from three of the four sources of resistance. these results suggest that a common genetic background was used in the different aphanomyces resistance breeding programs which selected the different sources of resistance studied.

specificity of aphanomyces resistance meta-qtl to environments , strains and scoring criteria, was not observed, as discussed in  <cit>  for qtl identified in baccara × pi <dig> and baccara x  <dig> populations. in this study, we confirmed the low specificity of resistance qtl in the dsp × 90– <dig> population, especially at the two highly consistent meta-qtl mqtl-ae <dig> and mqtl-ae25/ae <dig>  towards a number of french and usa environments or a number of a. euteiches strains from the same or different pathotypes tested than in  <cit> . however, some genomic regions were still observed to be highly specific to french environments , controlled condition tests with different strains  or aerial scoring criteria .

aphanomyces resistance alleles at most the consistent qtl co-segregate with alleles at genes/qtl controlling morphological and phenological traits
in this study, we identified co-segregating alleles contributing to resistance and morphological or phenological traits in seven genomic regions, including all but one  of the seven main consistent genomic regions associated with resistance to a. euteiches and one less consistent resistance meta-qtl . in these genomic regions, alleles derived from resistant parents were often associated with undesirable alleles for dry pea breeding , colored flowers ; table 2). co-segregation between resistance and favorable alleles , early-flowering plant), especially ones derived from  <dig>  were identified in some genomic regions . marx  <cit>  also showed that tolerance to a. euteiches was genetically associated with several wild-type alleles, including a  which was found to be associated with mqtl-ae <dig> in this study , as well as le  and pl . le and pl were not associated with resistance in this study, according to results obtained from one of the ril populations studied . we previously reported that r  and af  were other alleles associated with aphanomyces resistance at qtl aph <dig> and ae-ps <dig> , i.e. aph <dig>  in pea  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated again the positive co-segregation between r and resistance alleles in the dsp x 90– <dig> ril population at the ae-ps <dig>  qtl, i.e. aph <dig>  fondevilla et al. <cit>  and prioul et al. <cit>  previously reported qtl for earliness  that we localized in same genomic regions as two main consistent qtl identified in this study for earliness and resistance to a. euteiches . co-segregation between alleles associated with late-flowering and partial resistance to mycosphaerella pinodes were identified in the region on lgiii  <cit>  and the same associations were observed in this study for resistance to a. euteiches.

diverse candidate genes underlie aphanomyces resistance meta-qtl
the negative or positive associations observed in this study between resistance and morphological/phenological alleles may correspond to pleiotropic genes controlling plant architectural or developmental traits or to different closely linked genes. pleiotropic genes controlling plant architecture or development have already been suggested as good candidates for underlying resistance qtl  <cit> . in pea, clusters of qtl controlling numerous traits related to plant morphology, seed protein content and yield, nitrogen nutrition, and root architecture were mapped close to architecture and developmental genes, especially le and af, which were shown to be localized in genomic regions having pleiotropic effects  <cit> . our study supports the hypothesis that af is a good candidate gene for pleiotropy, impacting aphanomyces resistance  and earliness. evaluation of nils or mutants at the af gene  <cit>  for resistance to a. euteiches will be useful for validating the pleiotropy hypothesis.

clusters of different closely linked genes, especially resistance genes  <cit> , located in repetitive non-coding sequences have also been reported in plants, with increasing plant genome sequences available  <cit> . in our study, several aphanomyces resistance qtl were localized in regions previously reported to contain qtl controlling resistance to other stresses. based on comparative mapping of ssr markers, the mqtl-ae8- <dig>  region coincides with a main consistent resistance qtl to m. pinodes , a major frost tolerance qtl co-localizing with the hr  locus  <cit>  and a minor qtl for resistance to fusarium oxysporum race  <dig> . similarly, the mqtl-ae <dig> , mqtl-ae25/ae <dig>  and mqtl-ae <dig>  were identified in similar regions as the major qtl fwn <dig>  for resistance to f. oxysporum race  <dig>  <cit> , a major resistance qtl to fusarium solani <cit> , along with the qruf qtl for resistance to uromyces fabae <cit>  and the qtl frr <dig> for resistance to f. solani <cit> , respectively. regions of resistance qtl co-localizations have been suggested to underlie clusters of resistance gene analogs  <cit> . especially, the main-effect mqtl-ae25/ae <dig> region has been located in a region of rga clusters  <cit> , suggesting that defeated resistance gene may underlie the qtl. however, other mechanisms may also be suggested for resistance qtl, i.e. defense, signal transduction, as highlighted by the diversity of candidate genes identified in this study for main meta-qtl. our results do not favor one particular hypothesis for molecular basis of resistance qtl rather than another, corroborating ballini et al. and danan et al.’s conclusions  <cit> . fine mapping and mutants studies, as well as genome sequencing efforts, will be necessary to discover causal genes underlying resistance meta-qtl to a. euteiches in pea and to validate hypotheses currently proposed in this study regarding co-localizations between candidate genes and resistance qtl.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes alleles that significantly contribute to resistance to a. euteiches and their positive or negative associations with morphological/phenological traits. from the meta-analysis conducted in this study, a choice of alleles at meta-qtl corresponding to seven highly consistent genomic regions controlling resistance can be recommended, with their associated markers, for use in mas . resistance alleles at the most consistent region, mqtl-ae25/ae <dig> on lgvii, and especially the high-effect allele from 90– <dig>  appear to be the best choices for improving resistance. resistance allele derived from 90– <dig> at mqtl-ae <dig>  will be useful only in some usa environments from which the qtl was specifically detected. resistance alleles at the five other genomic regions could be prioritized for use in mas, depending on selection focus and breeding objectives . rils from the dsp x 90– <dig> population carrying 90– <dig> alleles at most of markers linked to the main meta-qtl on lgiii, lgv and lgvii  have been recently released  <cit>  and will be useful in breeding for resistance to a. euteiches.

because sources of resistance are limited  <cit>  and the number of highly consistent resistance qtl highlighted from this study is moderately low, the most consistent genomic regions controlling resistance should be carefully managed to prevent reduced effectiveness due to potential development of new virulent isolates of a. euteiches. in alfalfa, strains of a. euteiches from race  <dig> have been reported to overcome resistance to race  <dig> in cultivars grown in the usa  <cit> . in medicago truncatula, the level and nature of the effect of a major aphanomyces resistance qtl  have been shown to vary depending on the pathotypes of a. euteiches strains  <cit> , suggesting that qtl might have variable effects on resistance depending on the evolution of a. euteiches strains. despite the limited potential for gene flow in soilborne pathogens, a. euteiches could be assigned to the group of medium-moderately high evolutionary risk pathogens   <cit> , since the genetic structure of a. euteiches populations was reported to be patterned by a mixed reproduction system, including regular selfing with occasional migration of novel genotypes or outcrossing  <cit> . consequently, pyramiding consistent aphanomyces resistance qtl is strongly recommended, both for further increasing levels of resistance and for attempting to preserve the durability of each qtl effect. the best combinations of qtl to increase resistance efficiency and durability have yet to be determined. validation of qtl effects in different genetic backgrounds, knowledge of qtl effects on pathogen life cycle and epidemic development and an understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying qtl, will help identify qtl combinations that should be integrated in pyramiding strategies for durable resistance breeding.
