BACKGROUND
huntingtin-associated protein  <dig>  is a ~100 kda protein that was first identified in a screen for proteins that interact with the huntington’s disease  gene product, huntingtin   <cit> . initial interest in hap <dig> stemmed from its potential role in hd pathogenesis, and has broadened due to its emerging roles in feeding and metabolism  <cit> , and association with a range of conditions  including depression  <cit> , autism  <cit> , alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , joubert syndrome  <cit> , rett syndrome  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> . the biological function of hap <dig> remains to be fully elucidated, and is of potential importance to a number of research fields given the wide-ranging disease associations of this protein.

hap <dig> is expressed primarily in neurons  <cit> , and in endocrine cells of the periphery  <cit> . hap <dig> is also diffusely expressed in the mucosal layer of the stomach and small intestine in as-yet unidentified cells  <cit> . at the intracellular level, hap <dig> is associated with organelle transport , promotes neurite outgrowth  <cit> , is transported along nerve axons  <cit>  and facilitates receptor internalization  <cit> . hap <dig> achieves this through interactions with binding partners involved in intracellular transport, such as kinesin light chain , dynactin subunit p150glued  <cit> , dynein  <cit>  and synapsin i  <cit> . through linking to cytoskeletal motor proteins, hap <dig> acts in the trafficking of various cargoes such as glur2-containing ampa receptors  <cit> , egf receptors  <cit> , gabaa receptors  <cit> , bdnf  <cit> , probdnf  <cit> , amyloid precursor protein  <cit>  and β-actin rna  <cit> , and also plays a role in ciliogenesis  <cit> . such cytoskeletal motor interactions likely explain how hap <dig> promotes the release of hormones such as insulin  <cit> , and catecholamines  <cit> , as well as neurotransmitters  <cit> , through the regulation of vesicle transport to the plasma membrane.

recent studies support a role for hap <dig> in the promotion of energy conservation. hap <dig> stabilizes levels of an inhibitor of mtorc <dig>  <cit> , suppression of which is associated with the activation of autophagy. hap <dig> localizes to autophagosomes to promote their trafficking along axons  <cit> . hap <dig> gene expression increases in response to fasting  <cit> , and conversely, insulin mediates hap <dig> degradation in orexigenic neurons of the hypothalamus  <cit> , suggesting that the demand for hap <dig> is reduced post feeding. these findings are consistent with a role for hap <dig> in response to caloric insufficiency.

newborn hap1
−/− mouse pups fail to ingest milk, leading to postnatal starvation and death . conditional hap <dig> gene inactivation in hypothalamic orexin neurons decreases food consumption and body weight  <cit> , and hypothalamic neurodegeneration and decreased neurogenesis occur in mouse pups deficient in hap <dig>  <cit> . however, no defect in the hypothalamic expression of genes encoding appetite-regulating neuropeptides  has been detected in hap1
−/− mice  <cit>  and as yet, the mechanism by which hap <dig> deficiency causes postnatal failure to feed and thrive has not been established.

hap <dig> is one of a group of related proteins also including vertebrate trafficking kinesin-binding proteins trak <dig>  and trak <dig>  receptor-interacting factor, grif-1), the drosophila milton protein, and t27a <dig>  in c. elegans. these proteins share a homologous region  <cit>  termed the hap1_n domain . trak <dig>  trak <dig> and milton, however, contain an additional homologous region on the carboxyl side of the hap1_n domain called the milton/trafficking kinesin-associated protein domain , a domain that is absent in human and rodent hap <dig> proteins. the hap1_n domain is rich in coiled-coil motifs and facilitates the interaction of hap <dig> with the coiled-coil domains possessed by many hap1-interacting proteins including htt  <cit> , p150glued, pcm <dig>  <cit> , hrs  <cit> , kinesin- <dig> family member kif <dig>  <cit> , kinesin light chain  <cit> , and hap <dig> itself  <cit> . vertebrate trak proteins and drosophila milton interact with some of the same proteins/protein families as hap <dig>  and have overlapping functions. for example trak <dig> interacts with hrs and is involved in egfr sorting  <cit> . trak <dig> and trak <dig> interact with gabaa receptors and are implicated in their trafficking  <cit> . trak <dig> and  <dig>  and milton bind to kinesin- <dig> family proteins via the hap1_n-containing n-terminal region  <cit>  and interact with dynein/dynactin proteins  <cit>  implicating them in anterograde and retrograde transport. like hap <dig>  trak <dig> and trak <dig> proteins are involved in neuritic outgrowth   <cit>  and are also able to self-interact  <cit> .

in contrast to hap <dig> however, trak <dig>  trak <dig> and drosophila milton have a prominent role in mitochondrial trafficking. they link mitochondria to kinesin motor proteins via a complex with the rho-like gtpase miro, to facilitate transport of the mitochondria to nerve terminals, axons and dendrites to provide targeted provision of energy to localized areas within the cell  <cit> . although immunogold electron microscopy has shown hap <dig> localizes to mitochondria  <cit> , hap <dig> has not been associated with mitochondrial targeting to neurites. in contrast to hap <dig>  the milt/trak proteins have not been linked to starvation response and feeding.

in this study we investigated hap <dig> function by assessing the evolution and divergence of hap1_n protein family members, and conserved regulatory elements in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters. the online access to increasing numbers of sequenced and annotated genomes allowed inclusion of orthologues  representing the  <dig> vertebrate classes. furthermore, since little is known about regulation of hap <dig> gene expression, we also searched eight mammalian hap <dig> gene upstream promoter sequences for regulatory elements and multi-element configurations , using phylogenetic conservation to provide evidence for functionality. finally, upon detecting a highly conserved promoter model near the start of transcription containing sites for intestine-enriched transcription factors, we examined hap <dig> protein expression in the human duodenum.

RESULTS
verification of hap <dig> orthologous genes in vertebrates
searches for hap <dig> orthologues were performed of the genomes of the following species: human , rat , mouse , dog , horse , rabbit , opossum , tasmanian devil , zebrafish , chicken , anole lizard  and clawed frog . from here on, these species are referred to by their common names, except for xenopus. these genome representatives of the  <dig> classes of vertebrate, including eutherian and marsupial mammals, were examined using the ensembl genome browser  <cit>  and were each found to contain three hap1_n domain-containing genes. these genes were trak <dig>  trak <dig>  and a third gene that at the outset of this study was named hap <dig> or trak1-like, or was unannotated, depending upon the species. in order to confirm whether the trak1-like and unannotated genes were orthologous to human hap <dig>  genomic contexts were compared for verification . in human, the hap <dig> gene was found to be flanked by the genes jup  encoding junction plakoglobin, and gast  followed by eif <dig> further downstream , and a cluster of cytokeratin  genes . this genomic context was distinct from those of trak <dig> and trak <dig> . the same gene context was observed for hap <dig> genes of other eutherian mammals , marsupials  and amphibian . a similar arrangement was also observed in bird  except that the gast gene was absent. in fish , the hap1_n- containing unannotated gene  was positioned between jupa  and krt genes  consistent with other hap <dig> orthologous genes, and was therefore considered a homolog. the gast and eif <dig> genes were absent in the region in zebrafish, and jupa was on the antisense strand, in contrast to other vertebrates. in reptile , jup  was upstream of hap <dig>  and eif <dig>  was further upstream of jup, with additional genes  between them. in the lizard the cluster of krt genes was upstream of eif <dig> as in human, opossum, and xenopus, but the krt cluster and eif gene were upstream rather than downstream of hap <dig> . no gast gene was present in the anole lizard. in summary, all vertebrates investigated contained three hap1_n genes trak <dig>  trak <dig> and a third gene in a comparable genomic context to human hap <dig>  in a more recent version of the ensembl browser , the trak1-like and ‘unannotated’ orthologues described above have been renamed hap <dig>  consistent with our findings.fig.  <dig> schematic map of hap <dig> chromosomal regions. genes are depicted as arrows in direction of gene orientation. hap <dig> , jup , gast , eif <dig>  leprel <dig>  genes are shown. the genome sequences are from human , opossum , clawed frog , chicken , zebrafish  and anole lizard . not to scale




non-eutherian vertebrate hap <dig> proteins contain a trak/milton domain
the presence of predicted domains within the amino acid sequence of vertebrate hap <dig> proteins was compared using ensembl  <cit>  and ncbi’s conserved domain database  <cit> . whilst all vertebrate hap <dig> proteins contained the characteristic hap1_n domain, hap <dig> proteins from marsupial  and non-mammalian vertebrates  also contained a milt/trak domain characteristic of trak <dig>  trak <dig> and drosophila milton. hap <dig> proteins from human and other eutherian mammals  all lacked the milt/trak domain. interestingly, the milt/trak domain was also absent in t27a <dig> , suggesting the domain was lost a second time, in the divergence of c. elegans .fig.  <dig> evolutionary conservation of hap1_n and milt/trak domains. a common ancestor to trak-like proteins is predicted to exist prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes containing a hap1_n domain  and milt/trak domain . in protostomes, the milt/trak domain has been lost from the single homolog in c. elegans , but has been maintained in drosophila milton. in vertebrates, gene duplication has given rise to  <dig> paralogous genes encoding hap <dig>  trak <dig> and trak <dig>  prior to the divergence of the  <dig> classes of vertebrate. in non-eutherian vertebrates, hap <dig> is a trak-like protein with a hap1_n and milt/trak domain. the trak domain has subsequently been lost in the divergence of eutherian mammals




sequence comparisons of hap1_n protein family members
sequence comparisons were performed using hap <dig> proteins from selected eutherian mammals , marsupials , and non-mammalian vertebrates , trak <dig> and trak <dig> proteins from human and opossum, and the c. elegans and drosophila homologs. the complete identity matrix is shown in additional file  <dig>  human hap <dig> showed most similarity overall to hap <dig> from dog  and rat . opossum hap <dig>  which was highly similar to tasmanian devil hap <dig> , was more similar to hap <dig> proteins from non-mammalian vertebrates  than to human hap <dig> . in contrast, high homology was observed between opossum and human trak <dig>  and trak <dig>  proteins. in opossum, hap <dig> was more similar to its paralogs trak <dig>  and trak <dig>  than human hap <dig> was to its paralogs . hap <dig> proteins from non-human eutherian mammals  were more closely related to human hap <dig>  than to opossum hap <dig> , as expected by their lack of milt/trak domain. these results were consistent with a eutherian adaptation of hap <dig> sequence since divergence from marsupials. hap <dig> proteins from eutherian mammals , lacking the milt/trak domain, were shorter in length  than vertebrate hap <dig> orthologues that contained the milt/trak domain . the latter were closer in length to vertebrate trak <dig>  and trak <dig>  proteins. an alignment of all protein sequences in this analysis is shown in additional file  <dig>  indicating the position of the hap1_n and milt/trak domains.

a phylogram was compiled of isolated hap1_n domain sequences from trak <dig>  trak <dig> and hap <dig> proteins from human, opossum, xenopus, zebrafish, chicken and anole lizard, as well as dog and rat . the hap1_n domain of milton was included as a more distant reference sequence for rooting the tree . hap1_n sequences from vertebrate trak <dig> orthologues clustered closely together in a single clade, as did those from vertebrate trak <dig> proteins in another clade. in contrast, the hap1_n domain sequences of vertebrate hap <dig> proteins were more divergent. the hap1_n domain from eutherians had changed more substantially than that of marsupials since their last inferred common ancestor, as illustrated by an approximate 3-fold increase in phylogram arm length , suggesting that loss of the trak domain altered the selective pressure on the hap1_n domain.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of hap1_n domains of selected vertebrates and drosophila hap1_n family members. multiple sequence alignment was performed with the clustalw program. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. the tree was rooted using the drosophila milton hap1_n domain sequence as an outgroup. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches, where equal to or greater than 90 %. sequence distance is indicated by horizontal arm length, scale bar shown. the hap1_n domains from the following sequences were used: human , tasmanian devil , rat , dog , opossum , zebrafish , clawed frog , chicken , anole lizard , fruitfly 




search for a common ancestral protein containing hap1_n and milt/trak domains prior to divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes
genes encoding drosophila milton, and c. elegans t27a <dig>  in invertebrates, and trak <dig>  trak <dig> and hap <dig> in vertebrates, are likely to have arisen from a common ancestral gene existing prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes . we therefore searched for a common ancestor in the proteome of the early eukaryote dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> , an organism that exists as single cells and as a multicellular entity under different conditions. searches were performed using as query sequences drosophila milton and human trak <dig> . a single likely ancestor was not apparent, however a number of dictyostelium proteins showed significant similarity to the query sequences across the coiled-coil rich hap1_n domain. no matches were found to other regions of the trak <dig> and milton query proteins including the milt/trak domain. the majority of the dictyostelium proteins identified were actin-binding proteins  or kinesin family members, whose homologs interact with trak <dig>  trak <dig> and/or milton proteins. this is consistent with the ability of the hap1_n domain to facilitate interactions with other coiled-coil proteins including mediating their own self-association.

actin-binding protein fimbrin- <dig>  was the most significant match for both queries. other common hits were myosin ii heavy chain , fimbrin- <dig> , kinesin family member  <dig> , ddb_g <dig>  and ddb_g <dig> . these, and other proteins with similarity to either trak <dig> or milton, and their associated functions, are listed in table  <dig>  these findings suggest that origins of the hap1_n domain , pre-dated the evolution of the milt/trak domain which therefore arose post multicellularity, but prior to divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes.table  <dig>

regulatory elements and transcription factor binding motifs common across mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters
a computational promoter analysis was performed to identify transcription factor binding sites conserved across mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters. the rationale was that the presence of a regulatory element within hap <dig> upstream promoter sequences of multiple species increases its likelihood of being functionally relevant, and knowledge of the type of responses regulated by the corresponding transcription factors may provide insight into the biological pathway in which hap <dig> acts. the ‘common tfs’ function of the genomatix matinspector software  <cit>  was used to identify putative transcription factor binding sites within promoter sequences from human, rat, mouse, dog, horse, rabbit, opossum and tasmanian devil. for human, rat and mouse, sequence consisted of 600 bp upstream and 120 bp downstream of, and including, the single transcription start site  indicated in the ensembl genome browser. for dog, horse, rabbit, opossum and tasmanian devil the tss was not annotated so 720 bp immediately upstream of the start codon  was used since in human and rodents the start codon was within the first exon. these regions of sequence were thought likely to incorporate the core promoter region, which genomatix defines as being within 500 bp upstream of the first tss and 100 bp downstream of the last tss.

existence of a conserved max-cdx1/2-tbp promoter model in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters
the order, position and strand orientation of the transcription factors common to mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters were compared between species to identify common patterns. most notably, there was a site for tata-binding protein , also known as the ‘tata box’, on the sense strand, overlapped on the opposite strand by a site recognized by caudal-type homeobox transcription factors cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> . these sites were identically arranged in all hap <dig> gene promoters tested here . a site for myc-associated factor x  existed upstream, separated by 14–26 bp, on the antisense strand. in mouse and rabbit, this site was overlapped by an additional max site on the positive strand, but the site on the negative strand was conserved across all tested mammals. the distance between the conserved promoter model  and the start codon was shorter in eutherian mammals  than in marsupials . within the conserved max-cdx1/2-tbp model, marsupials contained an additional tata box upstream of the first, which was absent in eutherian mammals. this upstream tata box was also overlapped by a cdx <dig> site  on the antisense strand . five promoter motifs were found only in eutherian hap <dig> gene promoters and not in those of marsupials: x gene core promoter element  <dig> , zinc finger/poz domain factor zf <dig> sites , nerve growth factor-induced protein c sites  and e2f sites  . in  <dig> of  <dig> eutherian mammals, an xcpe <dig> site overlapped the max-cdx1/2-tbp model on the antisense dna strand . the consensus dna sequences for tbp , cdx <dig>  cdx <dig> and xcpe <dig> are shown as sequence logos in fig. 4b. a database search for single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the human hap <dig> promoter identified rs <dig>  a snp that exists at a highly conserved position in the consensus binding motifs of tbp , cdx <dig>  and cdx <dig> , such that the minor allele abolishes the prediction of all of these sites by the matinspector software. the snp is well represented in the encyclopedia of dna elements  which provided functional supporting evidence from chip-seq experiments that tbp, and associated regulatory factors including rna polymerase ii, bind at this genomic location in a number of human cell lines  <cit> . this snp is most common amongst individuals of african descent, in which the minor allele frequency is  <dig>  %  <cit> .fig.  <dig> promoter binding motifs and their location within mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters. a the core sequence of each binding site is capitalized, and the most informative positions are indicated in red. positions given are relative to the translation start site . the tata box motifs were identified both as ‘cellular and viral tata box elements’  and ‘muscle tata boxes’ . b sequence logos of the binding site motifs. total height at each position indicates the information content of that position , and the relative size of each stacked nucleotide indicates its frequency at that position




functions associated with human genes with cdx1/2-tbp and max-cdx1/2-tbp promoter models
a search of the genomatix human gene promoter database  was performed using the modelinspector program  <cit> , to identify gene promoters containing the cdx <dig>  cdx <dig> and tbp sites in the identical arrangement as was observed in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters . the search resulted in  <dig> matches in  <dig> sequences . the most significantly enriched biological functions associated with cdx1/cdx2/tbp genes, represented by gene ontology  terms, included processes related to cell-cell adhesion, calcium signaling, cell cycle, atp catabolic process, purine metabolism, phosphorous metabolism, microtubule-based movement, organelle formation, retinoic acid receptor signaling, and nervous system development . including the upstream max site in the model resulted in  <dig> matches in  <dig> sequences  corresponding to  <dig> genes. enriched biological processes included negative regulation of retinoic acid receptor signaling, negative regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, intracellular receptor signaling, development, and detection and transport of calcium . of note, the latter model was found to be common to several prame family genes  that exist in a cluster of related genes on human chromosome  <dig>  the commonality of function of these genes is likely to have caused bias amongst the enriched biological processes in this small gene set.table  <dig> overrepresented biological processes associated with human genes with promoter models found in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters

expression of hap <dig> in the human duodenum
cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> are intestine-specific transcription factors differentially involved in enterocyte proliferation and differentiation. the presence of conserved sites for these factors in hap <dig> gene promoters prompted us to investigate hap <dig> expression in the intestine. hap <dig> protein is known to be present in singly dispersed cells of the mucosal layer of the stomach and duodenum of mice  <cit> . enteroendocrine cells are dispersed throughout the epithelial lining of the gut wall and it is presumed that the hap1-positive cells are enteroendocrine cells. however, this has not been confirmed and no information exists on hap <dig> expression in the human gut. using immunolabeling we investigated hap <dig> protein expression in the human duodenum. hap <dig> was detected in mucosal villi from lean, healthy human subjects, in ~10– <dig> cells per villus. the highest density labeling was evident at the basolateral membrane . due to the abundant number of hap1-positive cells, we tested whether hap <dig> was expressed in the enterochromaffin  cell population. ec cells are the most populous of all enteroendocrine cells and synthesize and secrete 95 % of serotonin  in the body  <cit> . this cell type is also known to express the transcription factor cdx <dig>  <cit> . co-staining for hap <dig> and 5-ht revealed cells singly labeled for either target , as well as a subset that were immunopositive for both hap <dig> and 5-ht . intracellular distribution of both hap <dig> and 5-ht label was punctuate or vesicular, and within co-labeled cells, a degree of overlap in staining was evident .fig.  <dig> hap <dig> and 5-ht localization in villi from healthy human duodenum.  are related images highlighting an example of cells individually positive for hap <dig> or 5-ht. images  are the same field of view , showing hap <dig> alone , 5-ht alone , merged , merged with dapi nuclei stain , with lumen to the left. image e shows hap <dig>  5-ht and dapi staining in the wider context of the villus. images  highlight a cell immunopositive for both hap <dig> and 5-ht. lumen is to the top right in . epifluorescence images taken with 40× magnification. scale bar = 20 μm




discussion
insight into hap <dig> function from its evolution
hap <dig> of rodent and human have been recognized as sharing a region of homology  with trak <dig> and  <dig> proteins, and invertebrate proteins milton  and t27a <dig>  . previous studies have identified similarities in sequence and function between trak <dig>  trak <dig> and milton which possess an additional domain, the milt/trak domain, further carboxyl to the hap1_n domain. the c. elegans homolog, t27a <dig> , has been identified as a homolog of mammalian hap <dig>  <cit> . in this study we compared all the known members of this hap1_n family, extending this to include additional orthologues from the  <dig> vertebrate classes.

we have identified , hap <dig> orthologues in human, rat, mouse, dog, rabbit, opossum, tasmanian devil, xenopus, chicken, anole lizard and zebrafish. no additional hap1_n domain-containing paralogs apart from trak <dig> and trak <dig> were found within these genomes/proteomes. by sequence and domain comparisons we have determined that as recently as the marsupial lineage, hap <dig> proteins had a milt/trak domain and were more closely related to paralogs trak <dig> and trak <dig> than to eutherian hap <dig> 

hap1_n family members with trak domains exist in both vertebrates and drosophila. within the proteome of the early eukaryote dictyostelium, we found regions of similarity to the hap1_n domain in actin binding and cytoskeletal proteins but no similarity to the milt/trak domain. we therefore propose that the hap1_n domain has ancient origins in actin/microtubule attachment and transport functions, and that the milt/trak domain arose post multicellularity but prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes. given that hap1_n proteins with a milt/trak domain  function in targeted transport of mitochondria to distant cellular regions of energy need, a putative ancestral homolog containing hap1_n and milt/trak domains may have evolved with the development of longer cell types in multicellular organisms.

in deuterostomes, the number of milt/trak domain-containing hap <dig> proteins has increased such that in vertebrates there are three homologs . since all  <dig> classes of vertebrate have these  <dig> paralogs, the increase in paralog number most likely occurred prior to divergence of the vertebrate lineage into these classes. sequence analyses indicated less similarity amongst the vertebrate milt/trak domain-containing hap <dig> orthologues , than observed between trak <dig> and trak <dig> orthologues. this suggests hap <dig> sequences were already diverging  prior to loss of the milt/trak domain in eutherians. however loss of the milt/trak domain may have further altered the selective pressure on the eutherian hap <dig> domain, as the latter domain has diverged approximately  <dig> times more in eutherians than in marsupials, since their last common ancestor.

we found that the milt/trak domain has been lost a second time, in the lineage giving rise to the c. elegans homolog t27a <dig> . since only a single hap1_n-containing homolog has been found in invertebrates such as c. elegans, loss of this domain suggests that the function it imparts on hap1_n domain proteins is not essential for c. elegans. lack of a phenotype when t27a <dig>  protein levels are knocked down by rnai, indicates the t27a <dig>  protein itself is not essential for c. elegans viability, at least in the absence of stressors  <cit> . in contrast, the drosophila homolog, milton, is essential for larval development. it has maintained the milt/trak domain and functions similarly to vertebrate trak <dig> and trak <dig> proteins, in mitochondrial trafficking  <cit> .

to our knowledge, no protein interactions of milton, trak <dig>  or trak <dig> have been specifically attributed to the milt/trak domain, and it remains to be determined how loss of the milt/trak domain, shortening of the carboxyl terminus, and divergence of the hap1_n domain have altered the function of eutherian hap <dig> orthologues. loss of the milt/trak domain and carboxyl terminus may have affected the ancestral role in mitochondrial trafficking since drosophila milton interacts with mitochondria via sequences within its carboxyl terminal   <cit>  and this terminus is lacked by eutherian hap <dig> and t27a <dig> . milton also interacts with mitochondria indirectly through binding the mitochondrial protein miro via sequence within the first 750aa, spanning the hap1_n and milt/trak <dig> domains  <cit> .

as described earlier, mouse trak <dig>  trak <dig> and hap <dig> have many common interactors and overlapping functions, largely related to receptor trafficking. however, mouse hap <dig> possesses unique and essential functional aspects that are not fulfilled by its paralogs, since ablation of the mouse hap <dig> gene leads to defects in mouse cellular models, and causes postnatal starvation in mice. mouse hap <dig> has pro-catabolic attributes  that are undescribed for trak proteins, whilst trak <dig> and trak <dig> have well established roles in mitochondrial trafficking which have not been described for hap <dig>  whether these differences can be attributed to the presence or absence of the milt/trak domain and/or carboxyl sequence remains to be explored.

although not specifically a eutherian phenomenon, mammals are unique amongst vertebrates in that they endure an intense period of starvation between birth and maternal lactation, and upregulate catabolic processes such as autophagy in order to survive this transition  <cit> . mice deficient for autophagy gene atg <dig>  present with a similar postnatal phenotype to hap <dig> knockout mice, with no milk visible in their stomachs, and death within 1 day of birth, despite minimal abnormalities at birth  <cit> . in light of current understanding of hap <dig> function, we propose that hap <dig> may be important in promoting catabolic processes in periods of severe nutrient deficiency.

insight into transcriptional regulation of hap <dig> from gene promoter analyses
we utilized computational promoter analyses to gain insight into transcription factors and signaling pathways likely to regulate hap <dig> transcriptional activity. we found the analyzed mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters to be rich in sites for factors involved in the cell cycle, growth, and differentiation. the predominance of transcription factors involved in cell cycle control  suggests a key association of hap <dig> with this process. hap <dig> has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the growth rate of breast cancer cell lines, and is under-expressed in breast cancer tissues  <cit> . this negative effect of hap <dig> on cell division is consistent with the inhibitory effect of hap <dig> on the mtor pathway that promotes biosynthesis and cell division  <cit> . hap <dig> may also play a direct role in mitosis by facilitating attachment of cargo to microtubules for correct positioning during the cell cycle via its interacting proteins that are involved in these processes, including p150glued  <cit> , pcm <dig>  <cit>  and htt  <cit> . other factors with motifs in the hap <dig> gene promoter have roles in cell differentiation, growth and development . these factors may act upstream of hap1’s roles in postnatal development  <cit> , neurogenesis, neurotrophin receptor sorting  <cit> , neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and neuritic outgrowth  <cit> . binding sites in the mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters that may be responsible for transcriptional activation in response to stressors include sites for activating transcription factor  <dig>  and nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> . atf <dig> is a key transcriptional activator involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response  <cit> . nrf <dig> activates transcription of key metabolic genes important for mitochondrial function may act in concert with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α , a transcription factor responsive to changes in energy balance  <cit> .

tata box motifs were present in all mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters tested. this motif, named after its consensus dna recognition sequence , is found in approximately one third of vertebrate promoters  <cit> . it is the binding site for tata-binding protein , facilitating binding of the basal rna polymerase ii transcriptional complex for initiation of transcription. in eutherian hap <dig> promoters, we identified a tata box on the sense strand, starting  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the open reading frame , depending on the species. in both human and mouse the tataaa motif was positioned between − <dig> and − <dig> with respect to the transcription start site , which is an appropriate distance for a functional tata box. marsupial hap <dig> promoters  contained two tata box motifs in close proximity, further upstream from the orf than in eutherians . marsupial hap <dig> promoters also lacked xcpe <dig> sites, that were detected on the reverse strand within the tata box region of most eutherian promoters tested. xcpe <dig> sites are general core promoter elements that can enhance transcription activated by other factors  in in vitro promoter assays  <cit> .

notably, sites for max, cdx <dig> and  <dig>  and tbp were found to form a highly conserved promoter model common to all mammalian promoters tested. the model consisted of a tata box on the sense strand, a site for cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> on the antisense strand overlapping the tata box, and a max site shortly upstream. cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> are predominantly intestine-specific transcriptional factors involved in intestinal development, proliferation and differentiation, and are differentially expressed along the intestine and in the crypt/villus axis  <cit> . myc-associated factor, max is also present in the gut, and its gene expression increases along the crypt-villus axis in association with enterocyte maturation  <cit> . the phylogenetic conservation of these sites in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters suggests expression of this gene may be regulated by cdx and max factors during the development and differentiation of enterocytes.

go-term enrichment associated with other genes with this promoter model  identified biological processes potentially regulated by this combination of factors. in addition to processes in which hap <dig> has been implicated, such as microtubule-based movement  <cit> , nervous system development  <cit> , catabolism  <cit> , calcium signalling  <cit> , and inhibition of apoptosis  <cit> , these included processes such as cell division, cell adhesion, purine metabolism and retinoic acid receptor signalling, representing novel processes in which hap <dig> may be involved. the presence of functional cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> sites in close proximity of the tata box have been previously described in other genes such as sonic hedgehog   <cit> , glucose-6-phosphatase   <cit> , calbindin-d9k  <cit>  and clusterin  <cit> . in the case of the g6pc gene , transcription is activated by cdx <dig>  and this activation is inhibited by cdx <dig>  suggesting the existence of a competitive regulatory mechanism  <cit> .

interestingly, a human snp  was found to occur at a critical nucleotide in the binding motifs for tbp, cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> in the hap <dig> promoter. individuals homozygous for the minor allele present at expected mendelian frequency amongst african populations  indicating that the variant does not significantly compromise survival. given the functional data from encode chip-seq experiments indicating tbp  binds at this position  <cit> , and our finding that the minor allele abolishes the tbp binding motif, this snp could potentially alter hap <dig> gene expression and act as a modifier of conditions with which hap <dig> is associated.

insight from localization of hap <dig> in the human gut mucosa
whilst hap <dig> protein has been detected in the stomach and duodenum in mouse  <cit> , localization to a specific cell type within the intestine has not previously been confirmed, and the presence of hap <dig> in human intestine has not been explored. here we demonstrated the presence of hap <dig> protein  in singly dispersed mucosal cells in the human duodenum. moreover, a subset of these cells were serotonin -containing ec cells, which also express cdx <dig>  <cit> . expression in ec cells is noteworthy, as not only is gut 5-ht important in regulating gastrointestinal functions such as the modulation of gut motility , gathering evidence supports a role of gut-derived 5-ht in metabolic regulation and energy balance . furthermore, ec cells are responsive to nutrients including glucose  <cit> , and increase their synthesis of 5-ht during periods of starvation  <cit> , likely through a mechanism that senses reduced glucose availability  <cit> . interestingly, we found intracellular co-localization of hap <dig> and 5-ht in ec cells occurred in punctate vesicles at the basolateral membrane, suggesting a role for hap <dig> in the 5-ht secretory pathway. ec cells release vesicular 5-ht via a unique mechanism involving a small fusion pore  <cit> . whether hap <dig> regulates this process of exocytosis as it does in other endocrine cells  <cit>  is currently unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have identified eutherian hap <dig> as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate trak protein-like ancestor. the function of the milt/trak domain, how loss of this domain has affected hap <dig> function since divergence from marsupials, and whether/how this provides a selective advantage in eutherians, particularly in the postnatal period, are questions remaining to be addressed. we have identified conserved regulatory elements amongst mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters that provide insight into specific transcription factors and biological processes likely to act upstream of hap <dig> gene transcription. finally, prompted by the presence of a conserved promoter model including sites for intestinally expressed transcription factors  in the tata box region of the promoter, we assessed hap <dig> expression in the human small intestine. we detected the protein in singly dispersed mucosal cells, including within a subset of serotonin  positive ec cells, with partial intracellular colocalization suggesting a role for hap <dig> in peripheral 5-ht secretion.

materials and methods
database searches
gene information for synteny analysis was acquired from the ensembl genome browser  <cit>  first from version  <dig> and  <dig> and the national center for biotechnology information . hap <dig> genes examined were human , rat , mouse , dog , horse , rabbit , opossum , tasmanian devil , zebrafish , chicken , anole lizard  and clawed frog . protein sequences and domain predictions were obtained where possible from ensembl, or otherwise from ncbi if a more recent build was available . protein sequence alignment and identity comparisons were conducted using the clustal omega  algorithm  <cit> . phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the mega <dig> software  <cit> , by first aligning hap1_n domains using clustalw, then constructing the tree using the neighbor-joining method . the tree was rooted by assigning the drosophila milton hap1_n domain sequence as the outgroup, and clustering outcomes were tested by bootstrapping . protein sequence comparisons were performed using the following sequences : human , opossum , tasmanian devil , rat , dog , zebrafish , clawed frog , chicken , anole lizard , nematode , fruitfly . dictyostelium proteins with regions of similarity to human trak <dig> and drosophila milton were identified in proteins encoded by the dictyostelium genome  <cit>  by performing blast searches  <cit> , via dictybase  <cit> , using a maximum e-value cut-off score of  <dig> .

identification of hap <dig> promoter elements
human, rat, mouse, dog and horse promoter sequences were acquired from ensembl  <cit> . for opossum and tasmanian devil, only partial sequence was available from ensembl, and the start codon was not shown so hap <dig> mrna sequences from ncbi  were used to identify  genomic contigs  from which sequence upstream of the start codon was obtained. the sequence from each species was then entered into the genomatix software, and the ‘common tfs’ tool of the gene regulation software suite was used to perform searches  for individual transcription factor matrices  common to all entries, using default stringency settings . match results were extracted and presented with all positions given relative to the translation start codon .

overrepresentation of biological processes amongst human genes containing the hap <dig> promoter model
promoter models were defined using the genomatix fastm  <cit>  tool. the model including cdx <dig>  cdx <dig> and tbp only, was as follows: v$cdx <dig>  , distance 0 bp, v$cdx <dig>  , distance 2 bp, o$vtbp . the model including max, cdx <dig>  cdx <dig> and tbp was v$max. <dig> , distance 15–60 bp, v$cdx <dig>  , distance 0 bp, v$cdx <dig>  , distance 2 bp, o$vtbp . distances between elements represents the number of base pairs between the center of each consensus matrix for the site. the genomatix eldorado human gene promoter database  was searched for defined promoter models using the modelinspector software  <cit> , producing a gene list and an analysis of enriched gene ontology terms  associated with the listed genes. revigo software was then used to provide a summarized representative subset of enriched go terms using a clustering algorithm based on semantic similarity measures  <cit> , and those with a p-value less than  <dig>  were presented.
