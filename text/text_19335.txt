BACKGROUND
group a streptococcus  is a gram-positive bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, including the tonsils and pharynx, and is responsible for post-infectious diseases such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. in addition, gas causes severe invasive disease including necrotizing fasciitis  <cit> .

although the mechanism of severe invasive disease is still unknown, nad-glycohydrolase  secreted by gas is suspected as one of the virulence factors  <cit> . nadase has the ability to cleave β-nad+, which is universally important in numerous essential redox and energy-producing biological reactions, depleting intracellular nad pools  <cit> . nadase is also toxic for bacterial cells themselves, therefore, gas encodes ifs gene whose product  is an endogenous inhibitor of nadase activity and localized in the bacterial cytoplasmic compartment  <cit> . nadase precursor exists as an inactive complex with ifs  <cit> . in vitro, intoxication of keratinocytes with nadase was associated with cytotoxic effects  <cit> . bricker et al. presented that nadase enhances gas virulence in vivo using mouse models  <cit> . these results enabled us to further study the nadase as a target molecule to reduce gas virulence. however, another study of gas infection among aboriginal people in australia found no relationship between nadase production and severity or outcome of gas infection  <cit> . furthermore, we recently reported that m- <dig> group a streptococcal isolates were divided into three groups based on nadase activity: high activity, low activity and no activity  <cit> , whereas we did not find that low and high levels of the nadase activity correlated with severity of gas human infection . meanwhile, ajdic et al. reported that among  <dig> strains isolated from patients with mostly invasive gas infections from a recent outbreak of streptococcal infection,  <dig>  were nadase producer  <cit> , although strains isolated from patients with non-invasive gas infections were not assayed. it is unknown why the 8% strains isolated from patients with mostly invasive gas infections were not nadase producer. therefore, we thought that before taking up the study of our interest, it should be further determined how nadase is important as a virulence factor for severe invasive disease. we mainly focused on the following two points:  how do nadase activity levels correlate with virulence?  if nadase is important for severe invasive disease, and whether it is possible that ifs suppresses the severity. in this study, we present further evidences to prove the importance of nadase in severe invasive disease.

methods
bacterial strains
streptococcal strains were isolated as causative organisms from invasive diseases patients in japan . s. pyogenes  strain sf <dig>  which is prevalent as the database reference isolate , was provided by the courtesy of j. j. ferretti  <cit> . streptococcal strains were cultured in brain heart infusion  supplemented with  <dig> % yeast extract   broth unless otherwise described.

all isolates, except for sf <dig>  are derived from invasive diseases.

# japanese cities were described in parenthesis.

quantitation of nadase activity in bacterial supernatant
nadase activity was determined by the method of stevens et al.  <cit>  as described previously  <cit> .

construction of the recombinant his-ifs and his-tarc proteins
the ifs gene of pgst-ngagt <dig>   <cit>  was amplified by pcr with extaq dna polymerase  using primers ifs-f   and ifs-r . oligonucleotide ifs-f contained a restriction site for bamhi . the amplification product, which contained a restriction site for sali, was digested with bamhi and sali, and cloned into pqe-80l  to yield phis-ifs, whose insert was sequenced.

plasmid phis-tarc encoding a his-tagged carboxyl terminal domain of an escherichia coli aspartate chemoreceptor  was constructed by subcloning a  <dig>  kb kpni fragment of pit <dig>  <cit>  into pqe-80l.

purification of the recombinant his-tagged proteins
the his-tagged ifs fusion protein was induced and purified under native conditions as described in the manufacture's protocol , with the following modification. to induce the his-ifs fusion protein,  <dig> mm iptg was added to a logarithmic-phase culture of e. coli jm109/phis-ifs and shaken for  <dig> h at 37°c. a total of  <dig> ml of the liquid culture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged to sediment the cells. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> ml ice cold pbs + 1% triton x- <dig>  after a freeze /thaw and a sonication at  <dig> w for  <dig> min , insoluble material was removed by spinning it at full speed  for  <dig> min. one ml of the 50% ni-nta slurry was washed twice with  <dig> ml of milli-q water, equilibrated with  <dig> ml of pbs + 1% triton x- <dig>  added to the  <dig> ml cleared lysate and mixed gently by rotating at room temperature for  <dig> min. the lysate-ni-nta mixture was loaded into a column and washed three times with  <dig> ml wash buffer. the protein was eluted with pbs +  <dig> mm imidazole. the protein was verified using sds-page and anti-rgs-his antibody  or by dose-dependent inhibition of nadase activity of both gas culture and the gst-nga fusion protein constructed in a previous report  <cit> .

the his-tarc was induced and purified by the same method described above. in addition, characterization by sds-page confirmed that the iptg-dependently induced recombinant protein was purified as essentially a single band of the expected size  .

mouse model of invasive skin tissue infection
all animal studies have complied with federal and institutional guidelines. the ability of s. pyogenes to cause local skin lesions and necrosis in mice after skin inoculation was assessed using a procedure similar to that described elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, 3-week-old female icr mice  were anesthetized by ketamine-xylazine injection, and the hair was cut from the left flank using scissors and/or electric shaver to bare the skin, unless otherwise indicated. bacteria  grown in bhi-y were injected with a 27-gauge needle just under the surface of the skin so that a superficial bleb was raised immediately below the skin surface. the number of colony-forming units injected was verified for each experiment by plating bacteria on bhi-y or sheep blood agar plates  and counting colony-forming units.

the purified recombinant his-ifs or his-tarc was injected as follows:  on day  <dig>   <dig> μg  was inoculated together with bacteria in the left flank. it was confirmed that both his-ifs and his-tarc had no effect on bacterial viability and growth , and  on days 2- <dig>   <dig> μg  was inoculated intraperitoneally. the bacterial viability  was assessed by incubating the remaining mixture of bacteria and either his-ifs or his-tarc used on the day  <dig> for  <dig> to  <dig> hours, and counting colony-forming units on bhi-y or sheep blood agar plates. because it is difficult to increase injection volume in the skin, we decided to increase the concentration of ifs per ml of injection solution. preliminary test showed highest concentration  was more effective at reducing gas virulence than any of the ifs dilutions tested . thus, we used the highest concentration to add as much ifs as our possible.

creation of nga mutant of strain gt01
escherichia coli jm <dig> was used to propagate plasmid constructions. non-polar inactivated mutant of nga was constructed via double-crossover allelic replacement in the chromosome of s. pyogenes gt <dig>  to construct the plasmid for the nga knockout mutant, the 5' end of nga  was amplified with oligonucleotide primers ngagt-n <dig>  with an nhei restriction site and ngagt-c <dig>  with an smai restriction site, and the 3' end of nga  was amplified with ngagt-n <dig>  with an smai restriction site and ngagt-c <dig>  with an spei restriction site. oligonucleotides ngagt-n <dig>  ngagt-c <dig>  ngagt-n <dig> and ngagt-c <dig> contained a restriction site for nhei, smai, smai and spei, respectively, . fragment  <dig> was digested with smai and spei for insertion into multi-cloning site  <dig> of the pfw <dig> plasmid  <cit> . the resulting plasmid was then digested with nhei and smai, and both the spc <dig> dna fragment containing aad <dig> , which was obtained from a smai digested fragment of psl60- <dig>  <cit> , and the nhei-smai-digested fragment  <dig> were inserted. this plasmid, nga::aad9/pfw <dig>  was a suicide vector for s. pyogenes. for the preparation of competent cells, strain gt <dig> was harvested at early- to mid-log phase  and washed twice with  <dig>  m sucrose buffer. the constructed suicide vector nga::aad9/pfw <dig> was transformed into strain gt <dig> by electroporation. the conditions of electroporation were  <dig>  kv/mm,  <dig> μf capacitance and  <dig> Ω resistance, using gene pulser ii . after incubation at 37°c for  <dig> h, competent cells were spread onto bhi agar plates containing  <dig> % yeast extract and spectinomycin . selected colonies on the plates were cultured. cultured bacteria were washed once with saline, resuspended in  <dig> mm tris,  <dig> mm edta and boiled for  <dig> min. genomic dna was obtained from the supernatant of boiled bacteria. the double-crossover replacement was analyzed using genomic dna by pcr and successful double-crossover replacement was further confirmed by dna sequencing.

cloning of nga gene
all pcr reactions for plasmid construction were undertaken as previously described  <cit> .

the ngagt <dig> of s. pyogenes strain gt <dig> was amplified by pcr with extaq dna polymerase using primers nga-n4eco  and sloc <dig>  and cloned into pgem-t easy  to yield pngie <dig>  whose insert was sequenced. oligonucleotide nga-n4eco contained a restriction site for ecori endonuclease . the ngagt <dig> gene is oriented in the opposite direction as the lacuv <dig> promoter. an ecori fragment containing the ngagt <dig> gene of pngie <dig> was sub-cloned into plz12-km <dig>  <cit>  to yield plzn <dig>  whose insert was sequenced for verification.

to construct plzn-rbs, inverse pcr with pyrobest dna polymerase  using the primers lz-r <dig>  and nga-rbs <dig>  was performed to add a potential ribosome-binding site  to nga encoded on plzn <dig>  oligonucleotides nga-rbs <dig> and lz-r <dig> contained a restriction site for xhoi endonuclease, the potential ribosome binding site and/or start codon for the nga gene, respectively . the amplification product was digested with xhoi and self-ligated. the insert was sequenced for verification.

to construct plzn-rbsii <dig>  inverse pcr with primestar™ hs dna polymerase  using the primers nga-rbs <dig>  and lz-r <dig>  was performed to add the further upstream dna sequence  to the potential ribosome-binding site encoded on plzn-rbs. a oligonucleotide nga-rbs <dig> contained the upstream dna sequence, the potential ribosome binding site and start codon for the nga gene . the amplification product was self-ligated and the insert was sequenced for verification.

statistical analysis
the significant difference of virulence  between low and high nadase activity groups was ascertained as follows. the mortality of mice infected with each gas isolate, but not mean mortalities produced by pooling multiple isolates into the two groups, was determined. the four mortalities in the low nadase activity group and the four mortalities in the high nadase activity group were compared using an unpaired t test http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest <dig> cfm.

survival times were assessed using a log-rank comparison. r software was used for statistical analysis http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/russell/logrank/. p value ≤  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
correlation of nadase activity levels and virulence
the levels of detectable nadase activity produced by clinical isolates of m- <dig> gas were divided into two groups  in our previous study  <cit> . it is possible that isolates belonging to the high-activity group are more virulent, possibly causing invasive infection at higher severity and/or with lower dose. to investigate this possibility, we used a mouse model for the invasive soft-tissue infection, which is currently the most accepted available method for this type of in vivo experiment. as shown in table  <dig>  after skin inoculation with m- <dig> gas isolates belonging to the high-activity group, 80%, 60%, 100% and 67% of the mice were dead within a week, respectively, whereas with the isolates belonging to the low-activity group, 29%, 33%, 67% and 17% of the mice died, respectively . the survival curves , based on the data of table  <dig> showed that no mouse died after day  <dig> on the study.

mouse infection model using nga knockout mutant and complemented strain
to investigate the extent with which nadase contributes to gas virulence in the mouse model, nga gene encoding nadase of strain gt <dig> was replaced with an antibiotics marker. the resulting gt01Δnga did not show any detectable nadase activity and mortality in the invasive soft-tissue mouse-infection test . therefore, we tried to complement the phenotype using a plasmid plzn <dig> in which only the coding region of nga is cloned. however, the complementation study using gt01Δnga  strain was not successful in restoring survival times . unsuccessful complementation might be due to insufficient nadase activity in the gt01Δnga  strain . therefore, two additional plasmids  were constructed containing  <dig> and  <dig> base pair upstream dna sequences encoding the potential ribosome-binding site, which is lacking in plzn <dig> respectively . the resultant gt01Δnga , but not gt01Δnga , strain enhanced virulence compared to the mutant in the mouse model . the result of the gt01Δnga  strain may also be due to the same reason that the strain was non-functional, since it contained only slightly improved levels of nadase activity .

bacteria were cultured in bhi-y broth supplemented with kanamycin .

a, mice were observed for  <dig> days, because no mouse died after day  <dig> on previous study .

b, nadase activity was determined as described in table  <dig> 

furthermore those results encouraged us to construct plasmids containing longer upstream dna sequences than what is present in plzn-rbs and plzn-rbsii <dig>  however these plasmids were not successfully constructed .

assessment of body weight change in mouse infection model experiment
first, we judged the virulence based only on the mortality rate. although gt01Δnga  and gt01Δnga  did not kill the injected mice , possibly due to insufficient nadase activity, we found that there were some mice which exhibited a poor health condition but eventually survived. hence, we also evaluated virulence of gas infection in mice by monitoring body weight. in this method, lower body weight implies a more severe form of disease. we hypothesized that the body weight of mice injected with the complement should be lower than those injected with gt01Δnga . our results indicated that the average rates of increasing body weight in mice injected with the complement strain gt01Δnga  were lower than in mice injected with gt01Δnga , but this difference was not statistically significant . gt01Δnga  injection in the mouse model showed slightly lower increasing rates of body weight than did gt01Δnga   and gt01Δnga  . in addition, when the body weight on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection was analyzed, gt01Δnga  with the highest nadase activity showed the slowest increasing rate of body weight .

ifs-inhibition of the virulence of the gas strain gt01
if purified ifs is able to suppress gas virulence in the mouse-infection model, it would support the role of nadase in vivo. for this experiment, his-ifs was purified  and used in the mouse-model infection. meanwhile, as an unrelated protein, his-tarc which is a his-tagged carboxyl terminal domain of an e. coli aspartate receptor was used. as shown in figure  <dig>  the solution containing purified his-ifs, but not the control his-tarc, significantly reduced the virulence of gas. the control protein was not effective for gas virulence  because the mortality and the survival times did not decrease and prolong, respectively, compared with the result of gt <dig> infection without treatment .

discussion
recent reports have suggested that nadase is important for enabling gas to cause invasive disease  <cit> . these reports created our interest in nadase as a target molecule to reduce the gas virulence. however, before studying the ability of a nadase-inhibitor to reduce gas virulence, we felt nadase itself should be further characterized in its virulence causing role based on the following two reasons.  in m type- <dig> clinical isolate used in the previous study, the difference between mortality of mice infected with the nga strain and the parental strain was about only 25%  <cit> . meanwhile, we recently reported that m- <dig> group a streptococcal isolates are divided into three groups based on nadase activity: high activity, low activity and no activity  <cit> . if a high-activity isolate is used to measure mortality of mice infected with gas compared with the nga strain, the difference could be wider than if a low activity isolate were used. indeed, in this study, we found that the difference between mortalities of mice infected with gt <dig> , a high-activity isolate, and the gt01Δnga  was 80% . in addition, the difference in mice mortality between the cases of gt <dig>  and gt01Δnga  was 73% . this result shows that the gt <dig> isolate could provide an advantage compared with the m type- <dig> clinical isolate when studying the ability of a nadase-inhibitor to reduce gas virulence, which is our original interest.  to our knowledge, the reduced virulence of the nga-deletion mutant of gas has never been successfully complemented using a cloned nga gene. it is common knowledge that complementation tests in vivo are not easily accomplished due to increased technical problems when compared to an in vitro study. in such cases, some alternative methods can be used. for example, bricker et al.  <cit>  constructed two independent nga-deficient mutants and showed that they have similar phenotypes. in this study, we added two more points of supportive data. we showed that an nga knockout gas strain possessing a cloned nga gene partially restored virulence . in addition, we showed that a solution containing purified ifs suppressed the virulence of gas in the experimental mouse-infection model .

although the data of table  <dig> support our conclusion described earlier, some of the individual data were inconsistent with each other. for example, some of the strains belonging to low- and high-activity groups showed similar survival curves. however, this is not surprising because multiple factors play a role in gas virulence, and the productions of virulent factors differ among the strains  <cit> . therefore, it is important to compare groups including multiple, but not single, strains.

regarding nga knockout mutant and complementation, the nadase activity for the gt <dig> strain carrying the plz12-km <dig> vector was different from that of gt <dig> alone . indeed, the virulence between the two strains also appears to be slightly different from each other, although we were unable to explain the reason.

although the plasmid plzn-rbsii <dig> conferred significant virulence to the nga strain when compared to a control vector , we found that the strain nga  produced only 8% of the nadase activity found in the wild type strain. in order to restore nadase levels to near normal, we attempted to construct plasmids containing longer upstream dna sequences than what is present in plzn-rbs and plzn-rbsii <dig>  however these plasmids were not successfully constructed, possibly due to the potential toxicity of over produced nadase to bacterial cell.

as shown in figure  <dig>  injection of nadase inhibitor  significantly rescued mice from strains gt <dig>  to further investigate the potential of the his-ifs solution, we tested strain cr <dig>  which showed the highest virulence in the mouse-infection model among our collected strains . although his-ifs alone was not sufficient to significantly rescue mice from the strain cr <dig>  a combination of his-ifs solution and ampicillin was able to significantly decrease gas virulence in mice compared with ampicillin alone . these results also show that nadase activity occurs in vivo and can be inhibited.

using western blot analysis, we detected two bands from phis-ifs using anti-rgs-his antibody . based on the specificity of this antibody, we attributed the smaller band to degradation of the his-ifs protein.

the higher virulence of strain cr <dig> when compared to the other isolates belonging to high activity group  may not only be due to higher level of nadase activity, but also due to additional unknown factors. for example, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that cr <dig> presents a different pattern of secreted extracellular proteins compared to the other isolates belonging to high activity group, including markedly lower level of the speb protein . further analysis of the strain cr <dig>  although the less representative strain among the high activity isolates had not been focused on very much in this study, would be a very interesting advance for the field.

finally, we should discuss the discrepancy between nadase activity being important to the virulence of s. pyogenes during in vivo mouse models and our epidemiological data showing that low and high levels of nadase activity do not correlate with the severity of the s. pyogenes isolates in human infection. one possibility is that there is no statistical difference due to low sample number which is a result of a very small number of cases of the stss disease. there is another possibility. after human passage, the isolated s. pyogenes could be different from the original strain which caused the infection due to getting genetic mutations. it is difficult to directly confirm the virulence of the passed isolates, since humans are the only natural hosts for the organism. when dealing with organisms, which lack a non-human natural host, we can never be perfectly certain and therefore must rely on additional accumulated supportive  evidence. if our purified his-ifs  is able to rescue stss patients in future that could provide a more ethically acceptable form of direct evidence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented further supportive evidence that nadase is important for severe invasive disease of s. pyogenes in vivo using the experimental mouse model. furthermore, we provided useful evidence that the nadase is the potential target to suppress the virulence.
