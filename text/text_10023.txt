BACKGROUND
cotton is one of the most important economic crops in the world. male sterility is a simple and efficient pollination control system that has been widely used in hybrid cotton breeding. in cotton breeding, two major male sterile systems are used to produce hybrid seeds, namely cytoplasmic male sterility  and genetic male sterility . both systems have a maternally  or nuclear  inherited trait that renders them inability to produce or release functional pollen, so they can be used as maternal plants to produce hybrid seeds. the molecular mechanism of male sterility is currently a research hotspot in plant science.

many studies have demonstrated that cms is often associated with unusual open reading frames  found in mitochondrial genomes. for example, accumulation of the cytotoxic peptide orf <dig> in boro-taichung -type cytoplasmic male sterile rice  with chinsurah boro ii cytoplasm causes cms. the orf <dig> protein is expressed by a dicistronic gene, atp6-orf <dig>  which exists in addition to the normal atp <dig> gene in the bt-type mitochondrial genome  <cit> . nuclear-encoded-fertility restorer genes can suppress cms-inducing orfs and restore male fertility  <cit> . gms has been also extensively studied at the gene and protein expression levels with an exclusive focus on protein coding genes. up to now, very few studies have been on the relationship between male sterility and protein non-coding genes.

as a class of non-coding genes, small non-coding rnas  play an essential role in regulating the molecular machinery of eukaryotic cells by controlling transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> . these processes include chromatin formation and maintenance, defense against selfish and parasitic entities such as transposable elements and viruses, as well as native protein coding gene expression  <cit> . regulatory ncrna in plants can be divided into two primary categories, i.e., micrornas  and short interfering rnas . while sirnas result primarily from exogenous sources, mirnas are a class of endogenous small regulatory ncrnas with lengths ranging from 20– <dig> nucleotides  that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through perfect or near-perfect complementarity with target mrnas for cleavage or inhibition of translation  <cit> . some known mirna loci form clusters in the genome and these mirna clusters are probably produced by gene duplication and the mirnas in a given cluster are often related to one another  <cit> .

mirnas are key post transcriptional regulators that control various biological and metabolic processes in eukaryotes, many of which are conserved and have more recently evolved species-specific diversity  <cit> . mirnas also have important regulatory functions in specific biological processes during the life cycle of plants, such as controlling tissue differentiation and development, the phase switch from vegetative to reproductive growth, and responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . a growing number of new plant mirnas have been identified in recent years. to date, more than  <dig>  mirnas have been annotated in arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species  <cit> . however, the number of mirnas in plants is apparently not saturated because new mirnas are continually identified in different species. in upland cotton , only  <dig> mirnas have been reported.

anthers are highly specialized organs for nutrient storage and reproductive development. their maturation and development involves meticulous gene regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . in anthers, small ncrnas are essential for sporophyte development in the somatic diploid phase of flowering plants and small rna pathways are present and functional in angiosperm male gametophytes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, over-expression of mir <dig> leads to male sterility  <cit> . even though there is no direct evidence that any mirnas are causative genes for male sterility in plants, we hypothesize that differential expression of some mirna genes are involved in regulation of male sterility.

as the first step towards the understanding of their regulatory mechanisms and networks of target genes in male sterility in plants, expression of mirnas between a cotton gms mutant  and its fertile wild type  was compared using a deep sequencing approach developed by solexa  in the present study. the male sterility of the gms mutant ‘dong a’ is controlled by one pair of recessive genes  <cit> , and it has the same genetic background with its wild type . therefore, they are ideal genetic materials for studying cotton anther development and male sterility. in the present work, the expression patterns of mirnas and the critical small rna pathways of the gms ‘dong a’ and its wt were analyzed and compared at three different stages of male gametophyte development, followed by an integrated bioinformatics analysis to identify novel and candidate mirnas. furthermore, the expression profiles of mirnas were analyzed by mirna clustering, which has been widely used to study mirna expression levels in various species  <cit> . by further comparing the expression patterns between selected mirnas and their corresponding target genes, we have gained a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of mirnas in anther development and genetic male sterility of cotton.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of impaired anthers in the cotton male-sterile mutant
to determine the morphological defects of the cotton gms mutant, we compared the anthers of the mutant and its fertile wild type . at  <dig> day post anthesis , the mutant showed an abnormal floral phenotype with no pollen grains and smaller anthers than the wt . the pollen grains in the wt and the mutant were stained with 2% i2-ki to detect starch activity during the flowering period. there were many viable pollen grains in the wt, while there was no viable pollen in the mutant observed . therefore, the mutant is completely sterile.

distribution of small rnas during cotton anther development
based on previous studies that the peak of male sterility mainly occurs in the uninucleate microspore stage of anthers in ‘dong a’ gms mutant  <cit> , early anther development stages were chosen to identify possible mirnas that may be involved in events leading to male sterility. in this study, anthers were selected from two earlier stages, i.e., meiosis stage  and tetrad stage , together with the uninucleate microspore stage  from the gms ‘dong a’ mutant and its fertile wild type to construct six small rna libraries .

the datasets from the six libraries were used to query the ncrna sequences deposited in the national center for biotechnology information gene bank  and the rfam  <dig>  database  to separate the small rnas that matched non-coding sequences, such as ribosomal rna , transfer rna , small nuclear rna , and small nucleolar rna . the distribution of these fragments  is listed in table  <dig> 

almost  <dig> million small rna sequences with lengths ranging from 18– <dig> nt were obtained in these six small rna libraries. the majority of the small rnas in both the wt and mutant libraries were 21– <dig> nt , which is within the typical size range for dicer-derived products and in agreement with most previously reported results. of these,  <dig> nt small rnas were the most abundant.

variations in small rna expression in the wt and gms mutant during anther development
the total numbers of mirnas and sirnas in the three wt libraries were greater than those of the three corresponding gms mutant libraries . the number of unique mirnas in the three wt libraries was different from that in the three gms mutant libraries. moreover, the number of unique mirnas in the mar-f- <dig> library was twice that of the mar-s- <dig> library and the number of unique sirnas in the mar-f- <dig> library was also significantly greater than that in the mar-s- <dig> library .

analyzing mirna variations in the three anther developmental stages between the wt and its gms mutant, we found that the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique mirnas, respectively; the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; and the mar-s- <dig> and the mar-f- <dig> libraries comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique mirnas were shared between the wt and its gms mutant during the same three anther developmental stages, respectively . therefore, most of the unique mirnas found in the gms mutant anthers were different from those in the wt anthers at the corresponding stage.

the above results indicated that various small rna regulations were already present during the anther development of the ‘dong a’ gms mutant, as compared to its fertile wild type. these different small rna varieties and diverse small rna regulations may target different genes that influence the anther development and therefore male sterility.

identification of conserved cotton mirnas
aligning the small rna sequences to known cotton mirnas resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  matches for the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, respectively. in the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  matches for the wt and the mutant, respectively. in the mar-f- <dig> and mar-s- <dig> libraries, there were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  matches for the wt and the mutant, respectively .

sixteen conserved cotton mirna families comprising  <dig> , <dig> individual candidate mirna reads were identified in the six small rna libraries, with the gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> families being the most abundant, followed by the gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> families . of all the conserved cotton mirna reads, gh-mir <dig> dominated the wt and the mutant libraries, accounting for  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively . next is gh-mir <dig>  which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the wt and mutant libraries, respectively. in contrast, some other mirna families showed very low expression abundance in the anthers, with very lower read counts. the varied abundance of these mirna families suggests that the mirna genes are differentially transcribed during anther development.

analyzing mirna expression between wt and its gms mutant anthers revealed that gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  and gh-mir <dig> were differentially expressed during the meiosis stage, three of which  were also differentially expressed during the tetrad stage and two of which  together with gh-mir <dig> were differentially expressed during the uninucleate microspore stage . thus, gh-mir <dig> was in common in all the three stages and gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  and gh-mir <dig> were each differentially expressed between the ‘dong a’ wt and the gms mutant during two anther developmental stages.

degradome library construction and validation of conserved mirna targets
in cotton, conserved mirna targets were previously identified mainly via bioinformatics prediction  <cit>  and only a few conserved mirna targets have been experimentally validated  <cit> . in this study, in order to identify mirna targets, a degradome library derived from anthers of the wt and gms mutant representing three stages of development was constructed and sequenced, resulting in the generation of  <dig>  million raw reads. after removal of low quality sequences and adapter sequences,  <dig>  million clean reads were obtained and 98% were  <dig> or  <dig> nt in length as expected  in that normally length distribution peak of degradome fragment is between  <dig> and  <dig> nt  <cit> . of unique signatures,  <dig>  million distinct reads of  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length were obtained and  <dig>  million  signatures  were perfectly mapped to reference sequences in the cotton transcript assemblies database , which represented  <dig> %  of the annotated unique cotton sequences. these data indicate that the degradome library was of high quality with good genome coverage in identifying degraded mrna targets that should contain the sequence profile resulting from mirna directed cleavage.

by sequence alignments, a total of  <dig> distinct transcripts targeted by  <dig> unique mirnas were detected in our degradome library . gene ontology  categories based on biological processes revealed that these mirna-target genes were related to  <dig> biological processes ; the five most frequent terms are regulation of cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, macromolecule metabolic process, and primary metabolic process, indicating the importance of these mirnas in gene regulations during cotton anther development.

as shown above, many targets of conserved mirnas were captured by the degradome analysis, which provided experimental evidence to support previous predictions. the results of degradome analysis revealed that gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  and gh-mir <dig> directed cleavages of sbp-box , class iii hd-zip like protein , auxin response factor  <dig> , ap <dig> , acc oxidase  <dig> , and cu/zn superoxide dismutase  genes, respectively, which are key genes involved in hormone signals, cell patterning, and anti-oxidant metabolism. these identified mirna targets using degradome sequencing are present in the form of target plots  that plot the abundance of the signatures relative to their position in the transcripts  <cit> . in each of these t-plots, a clear peak for the absolute number of tags is found at the predicted cleavage site for gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  or gh-mir <dig> , indicated that there are correspondences between the cleavage positions and significant sites on the t-plots.

validation of mirna and target expression through taqman microrna assays
to examine mirna expression during three stages of anther development as well as validate the sequencing results, gh-mir156a, gh-mir166a, gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir396a and gh-mir <dig> were assayed to validate if these mirnas had significant differences in expressions between the wt and gms mutant anthers . the mirna expression patterns were similar to the sequencing results, indicating that the small rna sequencing results were reliable.

to test if any correlation between mirnas and their targets existed, the expression patterns of identified mirna targets based on quantitative rt-pcr  were compared . if a mirna degraded its target mrna transcripts, their expression levels could be negatively correlated. as expected, the expression levels of most mirna were inversely correlated with these of the corresponding mrnas. during the three anther developmental stages, gh-mir <dig> expressed at a relatively higher level in the gms mutant than in the wt, while its target gene encoding a sbp-box  expressed in the reverse way, as expected . unexpectedly, as compared with the gms mutant, this target gene expressed at a proportionally higher level at the uninucleate stage of the wt anthers, during which stage the gh-mir <dig> level was relatively lower . the relationship between gh-mir <dig> and its target  encoding an auxin response factor 4and between gh-mir <dig> and its target  encoding cu/zn superoxide dismutase followed a similar trend in the first and third stages . as compared with the wt, the gms mutant anthers had higher expression levels of the two mirnas and lower expression of their target genes at the meiosis and uninucleate stages. on the contrary, the gms mutant anthers at the tetrad stage had similar  or lower  expression levels of the mirnas, but their target genes had significantly higher expression levels, as compared with the wt . similarly to gh-mir <dig>  gh-mir <dig> was up-regulated in the uninucleate microspore stage of the gms mutant anthers as compared with the wt, while its target gene  encoding for arf <dig> expressed at a much lower level .

a reverse trend was noted between gh-mir <dig> and its target gene coding for class iii hd-zip like protein  and between gh-mir <dig> and its target gene coding for ap <dig>  in the gms mutant as compared to the wt. the expression levels of gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> in the gms mutant were significantly lower than in the wt during the three stages of the anther development, while the reverse was true for their target genes . it should be pointed out that, the negative correlation in expression levels between mirnas and their target genes existed except for gh-mir <dig>  but the linear correlation coefficients  were not statistically significant due in part to only three anther developmental stages sampled. the non-linear relationship of expression levels between mirnas and their target genes may also indicate that there are other mechanisms regulating expression of the target genes.

analysis of novel mirna candidates
given the fact that the sequencing of the upland cotton genome is incomplete, and information on genomewide cotton small rna population is unknown, accurate identification of non-conserved mirna in cotton is a difficult task. following a blastn search and hairpin structure prediction ,  <dig> putative unique g. hirsutum mirnas were detected in the six small rna libraries , including  <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library,  <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library,  <dig> in the mar-f- <dig> library,  <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library,  <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library, and  <dig> in the mar-s- <dig> library . all of these newly identified mirnas met the criteria for mirna annotation  <cit> .

comparing the expression of these novel mirnas between wt and gms mutant anthers,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas were significantly differentially expressed in the meiosis, the tetrad and the uninucleate microspore stages, respectively . identification of target genes for these novel mirnas suggests that they may participate in various aspects of anther development. for example, novel mirna mar-f-1-m <dig> was identified to target gene encoding a transport inhibitor response  <dig> , which can directly bind to auxin through the formation of the scftir <dig> complex and is the key protein in the aux/iaa degradation pathway of the 26s proteasome  <cit> .

discussion
small rnas regulate many aspects of anther development. however, no existing studies have reported the relationship between mirnas and male sterility in cotton. to understand the underlying molecular basis resulting in the male sterility of the cotton gms mutant, six small rna libraries were constructed during the anther development of ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant in the current work. to the best of our knowledge, the present study represents one of the first such attempts.

millions of unique small rna sequences of 18– <dig> nt in length were detected, including  <dig> novel mirnas, thus enriching the number of known unique small rnas in cotton. sixteen conserved mirna families were detected in this study. many canonical mirnas are conserved among mosses, eudicots, and monocots, and some have conserved functions among land plants  <cit> . for example, the mature canonical gh-mir <dig> in cotton is identical to those in poplar and arabidopsis. these conserved mirnas may play an important role in cotton anther development, as many of their targets mediate biological pathways, such as auxin responses and cell patterning, as implicated in the regulation of anther development, based on previous studies  <cit> .

both gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were predominantly expressed during anther development in ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant , an indication of important roles in regulating cotton anther development. in this study, gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were identified to target arf <dig> and class iii hd-zip like protein, respectively. as compared with the wild type, gh-mir <dig> was expressed at a relatively higher level in the uninucleate microspore stage, which led to down-regulation of arf <dig> by ten-fold in the gms mutant anthers . the much lower expression level of arf <dig> may affect the auxin response pathway in the gms mutant, which was consistent with the lower content of iaa in the uninucleate microspore stage of the gms mutant anthers . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> is thought to target mrnas that encode a class iii hd-zip-like protein that plays a critical role in shoot apical meristem initiation and leaf polarity and pattern formation  <cit> . however, the relationship between male sterility and the lower level of gh-mir <dig> in the gms mutant anthers relative to wt anthers is currently unknown and needs further studies.

mir <dig> and mir <dig> target squamosa promoter binding protein transcription factors  and apetala <dig> , respectively, which have been predicted to play important roles in anther development  <cit> . mir <dig> directly represses the expression of sbp-box transcription factors that play an important role in juvenile-to-adult transition throughout the plant kingdom  <cit> . it has been shown that mir <dig> directly promotes the transcription of mir <dig> via sbp-box, and mir <dig> acts downstream of mir <dig> to promote adult epidermal identity  <cit> . furthermore, the mir156-regulated sbp-box is a direct upstream activator of leafy, fruitfull, and apetala <dig>  <cit> . in this study, gh-mir <dig> and gh-mir <dig> were moderately expressed in ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant . compared to these of the wt, the anthers from the three anther developmental stages of the gms mutant had higher expression levels of gh-mir <dig> and lower expression of its target sbp-box. in contrast to the fact that over-expression of mir <dig> resulted in male sterility in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , we detected lower level of expression of gh-mir <dig> and higher level of expression of its target ap <dig> in the gms mutant anthers at the three anther developmental stages . therefore, the relationship between mir156/mir <dig> and male sterility in the gms mutant is likely different and needs further studies.

gh-mir <dig> was identified to target acc oxidase  <dig> , a key branch-point enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthetic process  <cit> . in anther development, ethylene is important for male gametophyte germination and anther dehiscence  <cit>  and it has been reported that fertile male gametophyte development is accompanied by two peaks of ethylene production in anther tissues and the mature pollen is characterized by a high content of ethylene  <cit> . in the current study, gh-mir <dig> was differentially expressed between ‘dong a’ wt and its gms mutant anthers in the meiosis stage, and it had a higher level of expression in the gms mutant anthers in the uninucleate microspore stage. this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of its target gene acc oxidase  <dig> . however, whether the opposite expressions of gh-mir <dig> and its target gene in the gms mutant anthers leading to a significant reduction in ethylene synthesis remains to be studied.

gh-mir <dig> targets mrna  that encodes cu/zn superoxide dismutase , which plays an important role in plant antioxidant metabolism  <cit> . in plants, the prominent role of reactive oxygen species  has been revealed in induction, signaling, and execution of programmed cell death   <cit> . ros can trigger release of cytochrome c, which is a ros-derived pcd feature shared among mammalian, plant and yeast mitochondria  <cit> . previous studies revealed that excessive accumulation of o2- <dig> and h2o <dig>  and a significant reduction in ros-scavenging enzyme activity coincide with male cell death in cytoplasmic male sterile of cotton  <cit> . budar and pelletier reasoned that the difference in sod gene expression between the cotton male sterile line and its maintainer may result in an imbalance in ros metabolism and male sterility  <cit> . in the present study, we showed the existence of different underlying mirna pathways that may regulate enzymatic activities in the wt and its gms mutant. surprisingly, gh-mirna <dig> was up-regulated by twenty-fold and its target gene cu/zn sod was reversely much lower expressed in the uninucleate microspore stage of gms mutant anthers, as compared to the wt anthers . up-regulation of cytochrome c by threefold was observed in the corresponding stage of the gms mutant anthers . the decreased cu/zn sod activity and elevated expression level of cytochrome c in the gms mutant anthers may lead to a transient oxidative burst and significant ros accumulation. however, more studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to male sterility in the gms mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
using a deep sequencing strategy, a number of mirnas expressed during three anther development stages of cotton were identified. the differential expression of the mirnas between the gms mutant and its wt indicates that mirnas are distinctly involved in cotton anther development and male sterility. further studies of these differentially expressed mirnas and their targets in the anthers will provide a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying male sterility in cotton.
