BACKGROUND
to date, numerous lesion mimic mutants  have been characterized in arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize  <cit> . frequently, lmm display enhanced disease resistance, constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related responses and an altered hypersensitive response . molecular mechanisms triggering the onset of cell death underlying the lesions mimic phenotype might have common features with hr-associated cell death observed during pathogen infection  <cit> . although a direct link between hr and plant disease resistance is often questioned  <cit> , it is evident that lmm can clarify numerous aspects of plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

although several barley mutants with necrotic leaf spots have been reported  <cit> , only very few lmm phenotypes of barley have been traced down to a particular gene. the best known examples of barley lmm are mlo  <cit> , and the recently characterized necs <dig>   <cit> , which apart from displaying a necrotic phenotype also shows enhanced disease resistance against fungal pathogens. the barley mutant nec <dig> comprising of a mutated cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel  <dig>  exhibits the necrotic phenotype and over-expresses the pathogenesis-related gene pr- <dig>  <cit> . a. thaliana cngc <dig> mutants dnd <dig> and hlm <dig> which are orthologous to barley nec <dig> mutants display enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial pathogens  <cit> . hvcngc <dig> shares 67% aa identity with atcngc <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that a similarly to dnd <dig> in a. thaliana nec <dig> mutation may affect barley disease resistance.

bacterial diseases of barley have been described, although the mechanisms of resistance have not been studied in detail  <cit> . apparently, there is no race-specific resistance to bacterial pathogens: thus, only pamp-triggered immunity is operational, even though cultivar-dependent differences in infection rates have been reported for bacterial kernel blight caused by pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . significant over-production of salicylic acid  upon p. syringae infection in barley suggests that barley resistance to non-host bacterial pathogens is achieved through a sa-mediated defense pathway  <cit> .

bacterial pathogens of arabidopsis are commonly used as a model system for plant-pathogen interaction studies. however, fungal pathogens are the causal agents of economically more deleterious and widespread diseases in barley. powdery mildew is caused by the biotrophic fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei . this is among the best studied barley diseases, and extensive details are available on both the race specific or race non-specific powdery mildew resistance mechanisms  <cit> . race non-specific resistance of barley to bgh is a cell wall-based resistance forbidding fungal penetration into a host cell  <cit> . penetration resistance is triggered by the ror <dig> protein, presumably directing secretion vesicle trafficking to the fungal penetration site  <cit> . race non-specific penetration resistance is fully attained only in the absence of the trans-membrane protein mlo which is a negative regulator of ror <dig>  <cit> . functional mlo protein employs ca2+ and cam signaling to ensure fungal penetration into host cells. mutations negatively affecting mlo binding with cam render barley more resistant against bgh  <cit> , while overexpression of another trans-membrane protein, bi- <dig>  counteract mlo-triggered bgh resistance in a ca2+ and cam signaling-dependent manner  <cit> . although the interdependence of ca2+/cam signaling and race non-specific bgh resistance in barley is well established, so far no ca2+ permeable ion-channel has been shown to participate in bgh resistance or susceptibility.

race specific resistance of barley against bgh requires the presence of plant r-genes called ml genes. in contrast to race non-specific bgh resistance, race specific resistance usually permits fungal penetration into the host cell, but restricts further spread of the fungus by triggering plant cell death  <cit> . both types of powdery mildew resistance have been shown to incorporate reactive oxygen species  signaling elements, such as increased accumulation of h2o <dig> and/or superoxide  <cit> . h2o <dig> acts as a principal signaling molecule initiating cell death during incompatible race-specific barley-bgh interaction  <cit> . early accumulation of h2o <dig> in mesophyll cells underlying attacked epidermal cells is proposed to be critical for the establishment of race specific resistance  <cit> . in race non-specific interactions, h2o <dig> plays a distinct role from that observed for hr induction. in mlo-triggered resistance, h2o <dig> most likely ensures host cell wall fortification, thus preventing fungal penetration  <cit> .

in this study, disease resistance of barley lmm nec <dig> mutants displaying necrotic leaf spots was analyzed. although nec <dig> has been shown to encode cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel  <dig>  and to over-express the defense-related pr- <dig> gene  <cit> , the effect of nec <dig> mutation on barley disease resistance has not yet been characterized. this study shows that nec <dig> mutation triggers the induction of h2o <dig> and sa, restricts bgh microcolony formation and affects non-host resistance against pseudomonas syringae applied at high inoculum density, whereas it has no effect on bgh penetration efficiency or mlo-dependent race non-specific bgh resistance.

RESULTS
nec <dig> mutant exhibits constitutive activation of h2o <dig> and salicylic acid
the nec <dig> allele in cultivar parkland was initially described as a natural mutation  <cit> , which was confirmed by identification of a mite insertion in an intron of the nec <dig> gene that caused alternative splicing and a predicted non-functional protein  <cit> . the nec <dig> mutant line gsho  <dig> and a parental variety parkland were genotyped with dart markers  <cit> . only  <dig> % of  <dig> dart loci were polymorphic, suggesting that the mutant is essentially isogenic to parkland . all described experiments were performed with parkland and its mutant nec <dig> accession gsho  <dig> 

as it was found that nec <dig> significantly over-expressed pathogenesis related genes  <cit> , it was investigated whether nec <dig> plants spontaneously display also other sar-related signals such as altered accumulation of reactive oxygen species and over-accumulation of sa spectrofluorimetric analysis of whole-leaf extracts of two week old nec <dig> plants with a fully developed lesion mimic phenotype and the parental line parkland showed a three-fold higher overall level of h2o <dig> in the mutant .

to ascertain whether the elevated overall amount of h2o <dig> in nec <dig> plants affected h2o <dig> accumulation during bgh infection, overall h2o <dig> amount in nec <dig> and wt plants was assessed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after inoculation with a virulent mixed population of bgh. the analysis did not reveal considerable changes in the h2o <dig> content of wt plants during the first  <dig> h after inoculation, whereas nec <dig> mutants showed a slight, statistically non-significant increase in h2o <dig> levels at  <dig> h after inoculation .

h2o <dig> accumulation and pr- <dig> expression is known to be associated with sa-dependent signaling. therefore, the sa content of nec <dig> and wt plants was also measured. hplc assay confirmed that levels of free sa and conjugated sa were four- and fifteen-fold higher, respectively, in nec <dig> than in wt plants .

resistance of the nec <dig> mutant to pseudomonas syringae
barley resistance to the non-host bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae likely employs sa-mediated defense pathway  <cit> . therefore, the constitutive activation of sa signaling in nec <dig> might contribute to its non-host resistance. nec <dig> plants were inoculated with p. syringae pv. tomato  at two inoculum densities -  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> using vacuum infiltration technique. at day  <dig> after infiltration with  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> of pst the amount of bacteria in nec <dig> was reduced, whereas parkland had accumulated ca. 6-fold higher amount of pst making the difference in bacterial growth between wt and nec <dig> statistically highly significant  at this stage of infection . inoculation with pst at lower inoculum density  did not reveal any differences in resistance between nec <dig> and wt plants .

ion leakage measurements were also performed to characterize the effect of pst infection on nec <dig> and parkland. vacuum infiltration with pst at lower inoculum density  did not elicit cell death in either nec <dig> or parkland . in contrast to inoculation with lower pst density, inoculation with pst at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> elicited differential response in nec <dig> and wt. tissue samples from nec <dig> plants inoculated with pst at  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> displayed more pronounced ion leakage suggesting an increased cell death in nec <dig> after infection .

resistance of nec <dig> mutant to powdery mildew blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei
since nec <dig> plants exhibited constitutively active defense responses, the role of nec <dig> in basal resistance against bgh was assessed. due to their basal resistance, even susceptible barley cultivars are able to restrict infection to some extent. in order to assess the effect of nec <dig> mutation on basal bgh resistance, microcolony formation was examined. nec <dig> supported formation of significantly  smaller number of bgh colonies compared to wt plants . to further test, if restricted formation of bgh microcolonies on nec <dig> derived from the rapid and effective localized response precluding fungal penetration or from post-invasive defense impeding further fungal development, we examined nec <dig> bgh penetration resistance. the effect of nec <dig> mutation on bgh penetration resistance was characterized as the proportion of interaction sites that had formed bgh haustoria to the total number of bgh spores that had germinated at  <dig> hpi. nec <dig> plants permitted almost identical entry and haustoria establishment rate of bgh as the parental line .

basal bgh resistance has been shown to be tightly linked to the molecular mechanisms of race-specific bgh resistance triggered by different mla alleles  <cit> . hvrboha and hvracb are known to participate in basal as well as race-specific bgh resistance  <cit> . the expression of these genes was characterized using real-time quantitative pcr. relative mrna abundance of the analyzed genes was not affected by nec <dig> mutation  indirectly suggesting that nec <dig> may be independent from effector-triggered immunity that ensure rapid localized bgh resistance.

nec <dig> mutation alters expression of bi- <dig> and mlo, but does not affect mlo-5-triggered race non-specific powdery mildew resistance
different powdery mildew resistance types employ at least partially distinctive molecular pathways: thus, a particular gene can have a significant role in one bgh resistance strategy, while having only a marginal or no effect on another bgh resistance type  <cit> . to find out, if nec <dig> mutation affected mlo-triggered race non-specific bgh resistance, the expression of mlo and bi- <dig> genes was analyzed using real-time quantitative pcr. loss of functional mlo protein renders barley almost fully resistant against bgh, whereas bi- <dig> over-expression in mlo mutants leads to restoration of susceptibility against bgh  <cit>  and, in fact, bi- <dig> is required for full susceptibility of barley to powdery mildew  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of mlo in wild type plants leads to super susceptibility against bgh  <cit> . significant over-expression of both mlo and bi- <dig> in nec <dig> plants was observed . to further test whether nec <dig> mutation had any effect on race non-specific powdery mildew resistance conferred by mlo- <dig> mutation, bgh penetration resistance of nec1/mlo- <dig> double mutant was characterized. similar to mlo- <dig> mutant, nec1/mlo- <dig> plants were almost fully resistant to bgh, allowing establishment of fungal haustoria only at less than 2% of interaction sites . in addition, the h2o <dig> content of whole-leaf extracts from nec1/mlo- <dig> double mutants was analyzed. while the nec <dig> mutant showed markedly increased accumulation of h2o <dig> compared to wt nec <dig> plants, the experiment did not reveal a significant effect of mlo- <dig> mutation on h2o <dig> over-accumulation in nec <dig> .

discussion
despite the fact that ion fluxes are known to play an important role in early signaling events during plant-pathogen interaction  <cit> , to date only several plant ion channels have been shown to participate in plant disease resistance or plant-pathogen interaction signal transduction. the cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel  gene family is one of the best-represented among the disease resistance-related ion channels. cngc mutants dnd <dig> , dnd <dig> and hlm <dig>  and cpr <dig>  exhibit a wide range of pathogen resistance  <cit> . mutations affecting atcngc <dig> enhance resistance of arabidopsis thaliana against certain pathotypes of pseudomonas syringae and botrytis cinerea  <cit> . although the effect of cngc mutations on resistance against bacterial and oomycete pathogens is well-studied in arabidopsis, little is known about the role of these genes in non-host resistance and also about the functions of cngcs in disease resistance of economically important monocot plant species such as barley. here we show that similarly to dnd <dig> in a. thaliana  <cit> , nec <dig> in barley activates constitutive over-accumulation of sa. high level of sa contributes to enhanced disease resistance of dnd <dig> to virulent pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  <cit>  and this resistance requires functional pad <dig>  <cit> , which is one of the central genes in sa-mediated effector-triggered immunity   <cit>  and sar  <cit> . although disease resistance pathways seem to be largely conserved among monocots and dicots  <cit> , the position of sa in monocot immunity is ambiguous. some monocots, such as rice, contain high endogenous sa levels  <cit>  and sa is not required for pr-gene induction in rice upon infection  <cit> . ineffectiveness of externally applied sa on induction of pr-genes has also been observed in barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> , however, inoculation with non-host bacteria pseudomonas syringae triggers sa accumulation in barley  <cit> . taking into account that such differences occur in the sa mediated resistance signaling among monocots and dicots, it is interesting to see whether mutation affecting sa mediated disease resistance in a. thaliana is also involved in barley disease resistance. the present study analyzed the effect of the nec <dig>  mutation on barley resistance against pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei.

mutation in the nec <dig> gene affected barley non-host resistance against pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. bacterial growth in nec <dig> plants was delayed at the initial phase of infection, if plants were inoculated with bacteria at high inoculum density. at the same time the increased electrolyte leakage suggested somewhat enhanced cell death, even though the conductivity values were much lower than reported for typical hr. thus, electrolyte leakage data in nec <dig> were generally in agreement with the expected "defense, no death" phenotype characteristic of hlm1/dnd <dig> mutants, although differences between nec <dig> and hlm1/dnd <dig> mutants may exist in this respect. non-host resistance is predicted to share common defense responses with host resistance - either basal  or eti  <cit> . the choice of which layer of immunity is activated upon a particular interaction with non-host pathogen seems to be case specific  <cit> . therefore molecular mechanisms leading to changes in non-host resistance of nec <dig> to p. syringae pv. tomato might have also had an effect on interaction with host pathogens. this prompted the assessment of the role of nec <dig> mutation in resistance to powdery mildew caused by the fungal pathogen blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. nec <dig> restricted bgh microcolony formation, while not affecting bgh penetration or mlo- <dig> triggered resistance to bgh. interestingly, despite the fact that nec <dig> did not impede mlo- <dig> mediated race non specific resistance to bgh, mlo and bi- <dig> mrna abundance was significantly increased in barley nec <dig> plants . significant over-expression of mlo and bi- <dig> might result from general activation of cell death-related signaling pathways and systemic immunity responses rather than from activation of particular powdery mildew resistance. together these observations suggest that nec <dig> mutation most likely affects pti and non-host resistance related responses and it is not associated with rapid localized defense responses required to prevent fungal penetration.

hr related cell death is suggested to serve in plant immunity as a factor triggering activation of sar  <cit> . spontaneous cell death might elicit constitutive activation of sar related signaling pathway in nec <dig>  previously nec <dig> has been shown to constitutively over-express pr-1a and β- <dig> -glucanase  <cit>  - molecular markers of sar. this study confirmed the constitutive activation of sa-related signaling pathways in nec <dig> mutants, since significant over-accumulation of h2o <dig> and sa in nec <dig> plants was detected. in arabidopsis thaliana, non-host resistance against some types of pathogens involves sa signaling  <cit> . in barley, a substantial increase in sa levels has been observed after infection with pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, but not after inoculation with non-host fungus blumeria  graminis f. sp. tritici  <cit>  or host pathogen bgh  <cit>  suggesting a differential role of sa in barley resistance against different pathogens. constitutive activation of the sa-related defense pathway may contribute to differential resistance of nec <dig> mutant against non-host bacteria pst and virulent host pathogen bgh. however, the cause for sa over-accumulation needs further investigation, and it remains to be determined, if sa-independent pathways are activated in nec <dig> mutant similarly to arabidopsis hlm1/dnd <dig> mutant.

CONCLUSIONS
nec <dig> mutation increased resistance against the non-host bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato applied at high inoculum density and it also inhibited microcolony formation of host pathogen blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, but its penetration resistance to bgh or race non-specific bgh resistance pathways were not impaired. the differential disease resistance response of nec <dig> plants might result from the activation of specific resistance pathways differentiating between various types of pathogens. sa-dependent signaling pathways have previously been shown to participate in disease resistance against certain types of pathogens, while not affecting others. nec <dig> mutant displays constitutive activation of systemic acquired resistance-related signals such as over-accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and sa, as well as over-expression of pr- <dig>  it remains to be determined, if constitutive activation of sa related signaling is the main reason for the differential disease resistance of nec <dig> mutant.
