BACKGROUND
the physiology of model organisms is often less well understood than their genetics , but is essential to the understanding of gene function. we argue that the atp levels of an organism are a relevant physiological parameter that is amenable for phenotypic analysis. perturbation of an organism's atp levels is an early indication of metabolic and physiological effects of disease, genetic make-up and stress. for example, one of the first manifestations of alzheimer's is a decrease in energy metabolism in parts of the brain that correlates with a specific decrease in the activity of a key mitochondrial electron transport chain  enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> . deficiencies in energy metabolism are associated with other age-related metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . impaired atp production is a feature of friedreich's ataxia  <cit>  and parkinson's disease   <cit> . a systemic defect in mitochondrial complex i is implicated in pd, and its pathological features have been reproduced by chronic exposure of mice to rotenone, a pesticide that specifically inhibits complex i  <cit> .

the "steady state" atp levels of an organism also reflect genetic factors. knockdown of etc genes in c. elegans resulted in decreased in vitro atp levels  <cit> , and deletion of genes in the insulin signalling pathway resulted in higher atp levels  <cit> . in addition, there is an environmental influence, with exposure to stress, such as heat-shock  <cit> , metabolic and oxidative stress  <cit> , anoxia  <cit> , and starvation  <cit>  shown to decrease atp levels and increase the amp: atp ratio.

stress induced changes in atp concentrations are often rapid and transient. depending on the severity of stress, compensatory mechanisms aimed at restoring atp levels are quickly activated  <cit> . therefore stress responses are better studied in real-time. we describe here a novel sensor for real-time in vivo assessment of relative atp levels in c. elegans.

we modified c. elegans to express firefly luciferase constitutively and ubiquitously throughout development. the enzyme is widely used in vitro to report on atp levels: it catalyses the oxidation of luciferin in a reaction that consumes atp and generates light and amp  <cit> . because c. elegans is transparent the luc-marked strains emit light when provided with exogenous luciferin. we have previously demonstrated a link between light levels and the worm's health upon exposure to environmental stress  <cit> . in this study, we generated highly luminescent strains of c. elegans that contained a luciferase gene, luc+, fused to the green fluorescent protein  gene, and specifically addressed the hypothesis that whole animal luminescence reflects its intracellular atp levels in vivo. to test this hypothesis we characterised the bioluminescence response of c. elegans during sublethal exposure to, and recovery from sodium azide , a treatment that inhibits mitochondrial respiration reversibly, and causes atp depletion  <cit> . consistent with our hypothesis, in vivo luminescence decreased with increasing sublethal azide concentration, and recovered fully when azide was removed. we then targeted mitochondrial respiratory chain components by rnai, and have shown a decrease in luminescence that was consistent with the drop in in vitro atp reported by dillin et al.  <cit> .

although previously achieved at the single cell level  <cit> , this is the first report to show that luminescence can be used for assessment of atp in a living multicellular organism. this will enable genetic analysis based on a readily quantifiable metabolic phenotype and has the potential to further our understanding of the many genetic pathways involved in diverse aspects of c. elegans physiology, such as metabolism, ageing, disease and stress response. since many of the c. elegans genes are well conserved  <cit> , the significance of these findings will extend well beyond this organism.

RESULTS
strain characterisation and effect of sodium azide  exposure
we have generated two independently integrated luminescent strains, pe <dig>  and pe <dig> . the data we show were obtained with feis <dig>  ubiquitous cytoplasmic expression of luc+::gfp is shown by luminescent strains throughout development . expression is strongest in the pharynx region and the tail area. luminescence was detectable during late embryogenesis, all subsequent larval stages and in the adult . addition of luciferin was required for luminescence: the background signal prior to luciferin addition was negligible. luminescence was enhanced  <dig>  times through the addition of 1% dmso and  <dig> % triton-x , provided to increase the permeability of the cuticle to luciferin  <cit> .

we tested the effect of azide on worm bioluminescence. exposure to 1â€“ <dig> mm nan <dig> led to a pronounced decrease in luminescence, without lethality . all the tested concentrations of nan <dig> stopped the pharynx activity as observed microscopically using a fluorescent microsphere assay. microspheres were found only in the pharynx and intestinal tract of control worms not exposed to azide . at concentrations above  <dig> mm nan <dig> the worms were paralysed but alive, as assessed by their ability to regain movement within  <dig> h of removal of azide. survival was 100% in each of the experimental conditions, proving that the drop in observed luminescence was not a result of lethality. to rule out the possibility that nan <dig> affected luc+::gfp expression, we measured the fluorescence intensity of worms exposed to nan <dig>  up to  <dig> mm nan <dig> there was little change in the intensity of fluorescence which reported on the gfp module of luc+::gfp. in contrast, bioluminescence of worms exposed to the same concentrations of azide was depressed, falling to approximately 20% of its maximum values in worms exposed to  <dig> mm nan <dig> 

in vitro determination of luciferase levels
to control for potential effects of nan <dig> on luciferase protein levels, or its function, luciferase activity was measured in lysates of worms that were exposed to azide under the same conditions as for in vivo experiments . a commercial kit that provided saturating levels of exogenous atp and luciferin was used for this purpose. luciferase activity was normalised to protein content of sample. no significant trend was observed between luciferase activity and nan <dig> concentration , therefore, under our experimental conditions the level and activity of luciferase did not account for the reduced light output in response to nan <dig> .

recovery from  <dig> min exposure to azide
one characteristic of nan <dig> is that its effects on atp levels are reversible. to further establish the link between atp levels and luminescence we have tested for recovery of synchronised l <dig> worms, young adults and gravid adults from exposure to  <dig> mm nan <dig>  luminescence was measured as quickly as possible over time, after washing worms from nan <dig>  and following  <dig> min incubation with luciferin in each case. rising luminescence was observed when worms were removed from azide, with full recovery within  <dig> min, as established by comparison with controls not exposed to nan <dig>  younger worms  recovered faster than older worms , possibly due to their smaller size and faster diffusion of azide from the nematode's tissues. in parallel, the in vitro atp levels of wild-type n <dig> worms were measured prior to, after  <dig> min treatment, and following recovery from  <dig> mm nan <dig> . atp levels, normalised to protein, were significantly reduced by azide , but after  <dig> min recovery were restored to the levels measured prior to azide treatment . thus, the recovery of luminescence was consistent with the in vitro atp results, showing a return to normal atp levels once nan <dig> was removed.

rnai knockdown of respiratory chain genes
to deplete atp levels without addition of exogenous chemicals, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were targeted by rnai, and the outcome was assessed by luminescence. rnai for respiratory chain genes caused a decrease in both worm size and luminescence in relation to controls , therefore to control for the reduced size luminescence was normalised to length of worms . the relative body proportions were maintained by nematodes that showed reduced size and thus length was a suitable descriptor of body size. knocking down gfp reduced fluorescence and luminescence dramatically whilst not affecting size of worms. this was indicative of decreased expression of luc+::gfp and was the only instance where the intensity of fluorescence was decreased, as observed microscopically. we found that rnai for: cyc- <dig>  a cytochrome c reductase  gene, reduced luminescence to 28% of maximum levels observed for empty vector control; cco- <dig>  a gene encoding a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase , reduced luminescence to 69%; and atp- <dig>  encoding a mitochondrial atp synthase  gene, reduced luminescence to 14%. thus, we have shown that reducing expression of respiratory chain genes has an effect on bioluminescence that is consistent with reported changes in atp levels under similar conditions.

discussion
in c. elegans, assessment of atp levels has until now been carried out in vitro  <cit> , a method which is accurate but implies the destruction of worms, limits the scalability of the analysis and cannot be carried out in real-time. we report on the construction of a luminescent transgenic c. elegans strain and have tested the hypothesis that light emitted by living c. elegans is a reflection of its atp pools. we used two approaches: i) exposure to and recovery from sodium azide, a specific mitochondrial inhibitor, and ii) rnai towards genes that are essential for mitochondrial function. azide inhibits complex iv of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by binding reversibly to cytochrome c oxidase  <cit> , this arrests the flow of electrons and leads to a decrease in atp synthesis. because the inhibition is reversible azide has been widely used as a c. elegans anaesthetic  <cit> . changes in bioluminescence upon exposure to, and recovery from, sublethal concentrations of azide were consistent with reversible atp depletion caused by azide. recovery in bioluminescence occurs within  <dig> min of removing worms from azide. similarly, recovery of atp depletion resulting from anoxia occurs within  <dig> min of reversal of anoxia  <cit> . luciferase expression and activity levels stayed constant in the azide experiments and therefore did not contribute to observed changes in bioluminescence.

the substrate luciferin has to be present intracellularly for light emission. it is not known how luciferin enters c. elegans. it is possible that it passes through the permeabilised cuticle. alternatively, it may be ingested through the pharynx. if an active pharynx was a requirement for luciferin entry, then substrate availability could be a limiting factor for luminescence under experimental conditions that alter the pumping rate, such as toxin exposure  <cit> . however, in this work, although exposure to azide stopped pharynx activity, the worms were able to emit light when provided with the substrate, indicating that luciferin was able to cross the permeabilised cuticle. luciferin has been deemed to be poorly taken up by cells  <cit> , however, empirical data suggest that luciferin uptake occurs readily. luciferin crossed the blood-brain barrier in mice easily, passing through endothelial cells that are amongst the least permeable cells in the mouse  <cit> . studies in other organisms such as drosophila  <cit> , zebra fish  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  also indicated that diffusion and permeability of luciferin did not limit bioluminescence. furthermore, we have observed that luciferin was capable of crossing the shell of unhatched c. elegans embryos, considered poorly permeable to chemicals, resulting in bioluminescence. we have also captured images of widespread luminescence in the worm's tissues, contrary to what would be expected if luciferin was poorly taken up by cells.

inhibition of respiratory chain components by rnai provided a means of depleting atp levels without exogenous chemicals. the response measured by bioluminescence is in agreement with in vitro data. in vitro atp was reduced to 20â€“40% when cyc- <dig> or atp- <dig> were knocked down, and to 40â€“60% for cco- <dig> rnai  <cit> . all experimental data were consistent with the hypothesis that c. elegans luminescence reflects its atp pools. additionally, the rnai experiments illustrate bioluminescence as a phenotype that could be the basis for genetic analysis.

wildtype firefly luciferase is targeted to peroxisomes  <cit>  and has a  <dig> h half-life  <cit> . in this study, the nematodes were transformed with a modified firefly luciferase gene luc+ fused to gfp, which is not targeted to the peroxisomes. luc+ is expressed in the cytosol and has a half-life of  <dig> h in human breast cancer cells  <cit> . the half-life of gfp is  <dig> h  <cit>  and therefore should not contribute to instability of the fusion protein. the greater stability of luc+ is an advantage for studies where atp changes may be tracked over time, as opposed to the requirement for a short half-life when luciferase reports on gene expression.

one critical aspect that will affect the luminescence readings is the levels of firefly luciferase present, this may vary for example between different strains and developmental stages. hence, the exact relationship between light output and atp concentrations will depend on the experimental conditions, ruling out precise determination of atp content. we propose this strain as a relative sensor of atp levels which can be applied to interrogate mitochondrial function and metabolism of living worms in a non-destructive, real-time and scalable manner. this will have broad appeal as sublethal physiological parameters are often difficult to quantify, especially on a large scale. perhaps the most exciting developments will be the identification of novel genes and pathways underlying physiological response, as well as a better understanding of classical pathways. the integrated luc+:: gfp fusion we described can be crossed into available strains carrying gene deletions or into new mutants generated by mutagenesis. alternatively, any of the worm's genes can be targeted for inactivation by rnai and bioluminescence will provide an easily quantifiable metabolic phenotype. the luciferase gene may also be placed under promoters that will drive its expression in specific tissues and allow for relative assessment of atp levels in that tissue. ballistic transformation methods will enable expression of the transgene in the germline where required. the transgenic strains described here offer a unique opportunity to explore the links between physiology and genetics of c. elegans and many other organisms with which it shares homologue genes, including humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the construction of highly luminescent strains of c. elegans and have shown that emitted light is a reflection of their atp pools. changes in bioluminescence upon exposure to, and recovery from, sublethal concentrations of a respiratory inhibitor were consistent with the levels of atp determined in vitro for similar conditions. luciferase activity levels remained stable throughout and consequently did not contribute to the measured changes in bioluminescence. we also presented evidence that luciferin crossed the permeabilised worm cuticle.

we used rnai towards etc components to reduce etc activity and lower atp synthesis. for the first time mitochondrial function of a whole multicellular organism was determined by in vivo luminescence, with light levels providing a sensitive measure of the atp levels. thus, luminescence proved an efficient means for detection of sublethal energy related rnai phenotypes.

deciphering gene function is an important challenge in the post-genomic era. often genes conferring morphological traits are the easiest to study, whereas those involved in sublethal behaviour and physiology prove hardest. the atp levels of an organism often provide an early manifestation of changes induced by stress and mitochondrial diseases. our strains will enable rapid real-time assessment of relative atp levels of a living model organism and will further the research of its biology.
