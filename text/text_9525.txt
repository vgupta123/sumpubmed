BACKGROUND
cd4+ t helper  cells play a major role in the induction and maintenance of ige-mediated allergy  <cit> , which is characterized by an excessive th <dig> response. the th2-cytokines, interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig>  lead to the production of allergen-specific ige antibodies which bind to high affinity receptors on effector cells. upon renewed allergen contact, cross-linking of these ige antibodies leads to the release of inflammatory mediators, which cause allergic symptoms. allergen-specific cd4+ th cells recognize their cognate peptide via their t cell receptor  in the context of self major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells . binding of the processed peptides to the human leukocyte antigen  class ii molecules hla-dr, -dp or –dq occurs in endosomal compartments and is facilitated by accessory molecules. these hla class ii molecules are highly polymorphic within the population and for many immunogenic peptides degenerate binding to different mhc-class ii molecules has been described. this feature is of interest for instance in vaccine development as it would allow presentation of such t cell epitopes on apc within a wide population range  <cit> . besides, also for tcr a plasticity in ligand recognition, i.e. degeneracy in peptide reactivity as well as cross-recognition in the context of distinct mhc-molecules has been found  <cit> .

in europe and parts of asia, mugwort  pollen causes the most prevalent pollen allergy in late summer and autumn. mugwort pollen contains only one major allergen, art v  <dig>  recognized by ige in 95% of mugwort pollen-allergic individuals  <cit> . in contrast to other relevant major allergens, art v  <dig> contains only one single immunodominant t cell epitope, art v 125- <dig>  which is recognized by more than 80% of art v 1-reactive mugwort pollen-allergic patients  <cit> . the presentation of art v 125– <dig> is exclusively hla-dr-restricted and is highly associated with the hla-dr <dig> phenotype  <cit> . other associations between hla class ii phenotypes and allergic responses to major allergens are by far less strong  <cit> .

although the t cell response to art v 125- <dig> is clearly associated with hla-dr <dig>  we previously found art v 125-36–specific t cells restricted by hla-dr <dig>  -dr <dig> or -dr <dig> in the minor fraction of dr1-negative patients  <cit> . accordingly, the peptide showed degenerate high affinity binding to several hla-dr alleles  <cit> . we also observed that specific t cell activation was inducible by apc expressing dr <dig> or other non-dr1-hla alleles suggesting tcr cross-recognition. although dr <dig> seemed to be able to present the immunodominant art v  <dig> epitope, the frequency of dr <dig> in our art v 1-reactive patient group  is not increased compared to the normal population . notably, we have also not been able to isolate dr4-restricted art v 125-36-specific t cells from dr1-negative, dr4-positive subjects  during our intense attempts to establish tcl and tcc from mugwort-allergic patients. this discrepancy between hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> is striking, as both molecules belong to the same hla-dr supertype that includes drb1*01: <dig>  drb5*01: <dig>  drb1*15: <dig>  drb1*04: <dig>  drb1*07: <dig>  drb1*09: <dig>  and drb1*13: <dig> which all show overlapping peptide-binding repertoires  <cit> . it is unlikely that the uniform t cell response to art v  <dig> is due to a restricted tcr vβ family repertoire, as we found a broad spectrum of vβ families in art v 125-36–specific cells even within single patients  <cit> . for dr4-restriction, in general also a broad tcrvβ usage has been reported  <cit>  arguing against a lack of specificity for art v 125- <dig> in the naïve tcr repertoire. thus, currently there is no explanation why the dr1-phenotype is highly prevalent in patients who recognize art v 125– <dig> 

in this study, we investigated the molecular background leading to the preference of hla-dr <dig> in the allergic response to the single immunodominant peptide of art v  <dig>  potential differences between hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> molecules regarding peptide binding and requirements for tcr recognition were addressed. we compared i) presentation of art v 125– <dig> by apc expressing either hla-dr <dig> or -dr <dig> to allergen-specific t cell lines  and clones  and ii) in vitro binding of art v 125– <dig> to hla-dr  <dig> and -dr <dig> molecules using mutated peptides; furthermore, iii) we performed computer simulations of art v 125–36-binding to both hla-molecules using molecular dynamics  simulations.

we found that the majority of art v 1-specific t cells recognize synthetic art v 125– <dig> and variants thereof as well as naturally processed peptides presented by dr <dig> and dr <dig> in a similar manner. differences in minimal epitope recognition suggested structural differences for binding to the mhc peptide binding groove. md simulation supported this conclusion demonstrating that the peptide is much more flexible at both ends and shows a detached structure at the c-terminus, whereas in dr <dig> the peptide keeps its extended conformation. together, the strong bias of hla-dr <dig> in the response to the immunodominant epitope of art v  <dig> apparently is not primarily due to mhc/peptide binding per se, but rather seems to be based on structural differences in the tcr-binding site of the peptide/mhc  complex.

methods
patients
eleven mugwort pollen-allergic individuals with typical clinical history, i.e. recurrent rhinitis/conjunctivitis during late summer, positive skin prick test  to mugwort pollen extract  and allergen-specific ige  to mugwort pollen  were included. all subjects were sensitised to art v  <dig> as determined by ige-immunoblots as described  <cit> . they expressed the following hla-dr alleles: pat. <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*11; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*15; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*13; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1* <dig> ; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*11; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*11; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*16; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*13; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1* <dig>  pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*03; pat.  <dig> drb1* <dig>  drb1*01; the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical university of vienna  and informed consent was obtained from all individuals.

allergen and peptides
natural art v  <dig>  <cit>  was kindly provided by matthias egger . synthetic peptides were obtained from thermo electronics . purity was >90% as confirmed by hplc.

peptide/mhc-binding assay
hla-drb1*01: <dig> and -drb1*04: <dig> molecules were purified from homozygous ebv cells by affinity chromatography using mab l <dig> as described before  <cit> . peptide binding to hla-dr molecules was assessed by competitive elisa. dilutions were prepared in 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm nacl,  mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 10 mm citrate . the biotinylated reporter peptide  was incubated with hla-drb1*01: <dig> or -drb1*04:01molecules in the presence of serial dilutions of art v 125- <dig> or single mutant peptides thereof. unlabelled ha306- <dig> peptide was also introduced to assess the validity of each experiment. after 24 hours of incubation at 37°c, peptide/mhc-class ii complexes were added to  <dig> well plates coated with l <dig> antibody and incubated at rt for 2 hours. bound biotinylated peptides were detected by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate  and 4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate  as substrate. emitted fluorescence was measured at 450 nm upon excitation at 365 nm by a gemini fluorometer . data are expressed as peptide concentrations that prevented binding of 50% of the labelled reference peptide  ha306- <dig> . two independent experiments were performed to evaluate competitive binding. data were reported as relative affinity, i.e. ratio of the ic <dig> of the peptides to ic <dig> of the peptide ha306- <dig>  to account for the differences of sensitivity of the binding assays.

allergen-specific t cell lines  and t cell clones 
art v 125-36-specific tcl were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by allergen-specific stimulation with either mugwort pollen extract or recombinant art v  <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . art v 125-36-specific tcc were established from these tcl by limiting dilution  <cit> . the two ebv-transformed b cell lines used as apc expressed comparable amounts of hla-dr molecules  as well as hla-dq, -dp- and the co-stimulatory molecules cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  on their surface. tcl or tcc  were stimulated for 3 days with irradiated  apc and peptides at an optimum concentration of 3 μm, if not indicated otherwise. proliferation was assessed by 3h-thymidine uptake within the last 16 hours of incubation. results are shown in delta cpm .

flow cytometry
ebv-transformed b cell lines were stained with fitc-labelled hla-dr , dp- and dq- antibodies, cd <dig> pe, cd <dig> pe  and anti cd <dig> fitc  and were analyzed on a facscanto with diva-software.

hla-typing
typing of hla-drb1-alleles was performed using a commercial sso typing kit . samples with only a single detectable drb1-allele were additionally typed by ssp . high resolution typing was performed by nucleotide sequencing .

computer simulation
as starting structure we employed the x-ray structure of hiv gag/hla-drb1*01: <dig>  protein data bank   <cit>  accession code   <cit> , as it comprises hla-dr <dig> in complex with a 13-mer peptide  which also contains isoleucine as anchor residue similar to art v 125- <dig> . we have previously shown that it is sufficient to mutate the side chains of the peptide and leave its backbone untouched to obtain reliable starting structures  <cit> . we selected the side-chain substitution tool scwrl  <cit>  to model art v 125- <dig> into the mhc binding groove, since we had found that this tool is the most accurate regarding peptide/mhc interactions  <cit> .

as the x-ray structure of hla-drb1*04: <dig> has not been resolved yet and hla-drb1*01: <dig> and hla-drb1*04: <dig> show a sequence identity of  <dig> %, we modelled the structure of drb1*04: <dig> directly on the basis of the previously created hla-drb1*01: <dig> structure. the differing residues were mutated using scwrl yielding  <dig>  complexes with identical backbone structure and a few side chain mutations in the mhc.

to perform md simulations we used the software package gromacs  <dig>  <cit> . first, we immersed both complexes into distinct explicit artificial water boxes. then we employed a steepest descent energy minimisation of the complexes to resolve spatial clashes and simulated warming to 310 k using position restraints. to provide insight into the dynamics of the pmhc complex at atomic scale, we subsequently carried out md simulations  <cit>  to investigate spatial rearrangements of molecular structures in water for a real time of 30 ns. all further parameters of the simulation were set according to omasits et al.  <cit> .

we evaluated the resulting trajectories using the root mean square fluctuation  which is defined as:

  rmsfi=1m∑k=1mritk−r˜i <dig> 

m is the number of frames, ritk is particle with number i of complex r at time k and r˜ is the reference structure. this method essentially assesses flexibility of molecules and is implemented in gromacs in the g_rmsf function. furthermore, we calculated the solvent accessible surface area   <cit>  of the side chains of the peptide by rolling a sphere over them  <cit> . this method is implemented in gromacs in the g_sas function. visual pre-screening was performed using visual molecular dynamics software   <cit>  and the plug-in vmdice  <cit> .

statistics
significance levels were calculated by using wilcoxon signed rank test .

RESULTS
presentation of art v 125- <dig> and mutant peptides by hla-dr <dig> and -dr4
to compare the peptide presenting capacity of hla-dr <dig> and dr <dig>   <dig> art v 125-36-specific tcl from  <dig> different patients and  <dig> art v 125-36-specific tcc derived from  <dig> different patients were stimulated with the synthetic art v 125- <dig> 12-mer peptide in the presence of dr1- or dr4-expressing apc. at optimum peptide concentrations, tcl proliferated slightly less with dr <dig>  although no statistically significant difference was found . a similar picture was found with the vast majority of tcc with median proliferations of  <dig>  dpm to dr <dig> and  <dig>  dpm to dr <dig> . 3/ <dig>  tcc did not respond to presentation by dr <dig>  at lower concentrations of art v 125- <dig>  apc expressing dr <dig> outperformed those expressing dr <dig> .

next we determined the minimal t cell epitopes within art v 125- <dig> by employing truncated peptides for stimulation of art v 125-36-reactive tcl  and one tcc . minimal epitopes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> aa for dr <dig> and from  <dig> to <dig> aa for dr <dig>  within these minimal epitopes, the central indispensable aa common in all experiments were eweka for dr <dig> and iewekaqh for dr <dig>  in  <dig> tcc  and  <dig> tcl , the minimal epitope was shorter for dr <dig> than for dr <dig> . for 3/ <dig> art v 125-36-specific tcl we found identical minimal epitopes for presentation by either dr-molecule.

in general, for peptides which bind to dr <dig> or dr <dig>  the aa in positions p <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are supposed to be relevant for hla-binding, interacting with pockets on the bottom of the binding groove, so that the surface-exposed intermittent aa residues at p2/ <dig>  p <dig>  p7/ <dig> can interact with the tcr  <cit> . i <dig> has previously been identified as anchor residue p <dig> of art v 125- <dig> <cit> . to identify critical aa residues of art v 125- <dig> when presented either by dr <dig> or dr <dig>  a set of peptide analogues with single aa substitutions was used for t cell stimulations. besides the crucial anchor residue i <dig> , w <dig>  turned out to be indispensable for t cell reactivity in response to presentation by dr <dig> and dr <dig> in all tcl  and tcc  tested . moreover, e <dig> , e <dig>  and k <dig>  were critical for more than 70% of the t cell responses. the residues c <dig> , q <dig> , h <dig>  and a <dig>  turned out to be additionally important for 30-50% of t cells, again irrespective of presentation by dr <dig> or dr <dig> . a <dig>  and g <dig>  represented dispensable residues, possibly due to their small side chains which limit molecular interactions.

taken together, for the t cell recognition of art v 125- <dig> we found indications for a shorter minimal epitope in dr <dig>  but no marked differences in the position and number of residues crucial for interaction with the two hla-molecules.

presentation of naturally-processed art v 1-peptides by hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> molecules
the experiments performed so far had been based on synthetic 12-mer peptides which might bind directly to hla-dr-molecules expressed on the surface of apc. to compare intracellular loading of processed art v 1-peptides onto dr1- and dr4-molecules, hla-dr1- or dr4-expressing apc were incubated with titrated amounts of art v  <dig> and used to stimulate art v 125-36–specific t cell cultures. as observed before with synthetic peptides, the art v 125-36-specific tcl and  <dig> tcc proliferated equally well to dr <dig> or dr <dig> at optimum concentrations. however, at lower concentrations dr <dig> tended to be more effective for t cell stimulation .

binding of art v 125- <dig> to hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> molecules
the binding capacity of art v 125- <dig> to hla-drb1*01: <dig> and –drb1*04: <dig> was assessed in competition studies using ha306- <dig> as reporter peptide . ha306- <dig>  a high affinity binder to both dr <dig> and dr <dig>  inhibited itself at an ic <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> nm, respectively. art v 125- <dig> was found to bind only 15-fold less to both hla molecules and hence can still be considered a strong binder for both hla-molecules. for comparison, we used the neighbouring 12-mer peptides art v 122– <dig> and art v 119– <dig> which showed weak and negligible binding to dr <dig> or dr <dig> molecules, respectively.

a relative binding activity. binding of peptides to hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> molecules was assessed by competitive inhibition of the high affinity interaction of biotinylated-ha306- <dig> with hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> as described in methods. ic <dig> values were converted into relative activities  to take into account the differences of sensitivity of the binding assays. the ic <dig> of ha306- <dig> was  <dig>  nm for hla-dr <dig> and  <dig> nm for -dr <dig> 

to allocate the aa residues crucial for anchoring the peptide within the groove of the hla molecule, peptides with single alanine/glycine substitutions at each amino acid position of art v 125– <dig> were used. for both hla-molecules a marked loss of binding was obtained by replacing i <dig> , clearly confirming that this is the anchor residue for hla-dr <dig>  <cit>  and indicating that the peptide uses the same anchor residue for binding to dr <dig>  weaker binding losses for either molecule were induced by glycine substitutions of original alanine residues , which might result from enhancement of the peptide flexibility due to the special properties of glycine. substitution of w <dig> resulted in a slight effect on binding to dr <dig>  but not to dr <dig> 

computer simulation of art v 125- <dig> bound to hla-dr <dig> and -dr4
in parallel to our in vitro experiments, we investigated structural differences at the level of mhc/peptide binding in silico by performing md simulations. hla-drb1*01: <dig> and hla-drb1*04: <dig> show an aa sequence identity of  <dig> %. on this basis the overall tertiary structure is expected to be very similar . however, the binding dynamics of art v 125- <dig> to each hla-molecule differed markedly during the simulation time of 30 ns . the interaction with hla-dr <dig> was characterized by highly flexible aa residues at the n-  and c-terminus  of the peptide with the latter detaching from the binding groove . in contrast, only a <dig> showed high flexibility in the interaction with hla-dr <dig> . the different dynamics of art v 125- <dig> binding to hla-drb1*01: <dig> and hla-drb1*04: <dig> were also reflected in the mean solvent accessible surface area  . k <dig> and h <dig> show an increased sasa in hla-drb1*01: <dig> compared to dr <dig>  while the sasa was decreased in the case of k <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and q <dig>  interestingly, the increased flexibility of art v 125- <dig> in association with hla-drb1*01: <dig> was restricted solely to the peptide itself while the helices of the alpha- and beta-chains of dr <dig> and dr <dig> showed a similar behaviour in both molecules . for i <dig> we found a low flexibility and an almost identical sasa in both complexes indicating that this residue is stably bound to the mhc in both cases.

discussion
in spite of the strong association of the allergic immune response to art v  <dig> with hla-dr <dig>  we have previously shown that the in vitro binding of its single major t cell epitope art v 125- <dig> to hla-class ii molecules and its recognition by cd4+ t cells is degenerate  <cit> . in addition to the vast majority of art v 125-36-specific, dr1-restricted tcc, a few tcc from dr1-negative patients have been isolated that were restricted by dr <dig>  dr <dig> or dr <dig>  although dr <dig> in general has similar peptide binding characteristics  <cit>  as dr <dig> and binds art v 125- <dig> which can be cross-recognized by dr1-restricted tcc in vitro <cit> , no art v 125-36–specific dr4-restricted tcc have been isolated so far. therefore, we expected differences in art v 125-36–peptide binding and t cell activation between hla-dr <dig> and -dr <dig> and compared anchor residues and minimal epitopes of the peptide to elucidate the molecular background for the dr1-biased t cell response to art v 125- <dig> in more detail. to find further support for structural differences between art v 125- <dig> bound to hla-dr <dig> or hla-dr <dig> we also applied md simulations to the respective pmhc complexes. as there was no crystal structure available for hla-dr <dig>  our computer simulations on peptide/hla-dr <dig> interactions were performed on a modeled structure based on the x-ray structure of hla-dr <dig>  nevertheless, this model of hla-drb1*04: <dig> can be assumed to be reliable, as the sequence identity between dr <dig> and dr <dig> is above 90% and models based on a template with a sequence identity >50% are generally regarded as highly accurate  <cit> . furthermore, major changes in the fold of mhc molecules are extremely unlikely since the mhc superfamily shares a common overall shape  <cit> .

first, we confirmed t cell cross-recognition of art v 125- <dig> presented by apc expressing dr <dig>  all t cell cultures used in this study were derived from dr1-positive donors and had most probably been selected by this mhc class ii restriction element. still, the vast majority of tcc  recognized art v 125- <dig> presented by dr <dig> indicating degenerate tcr recognition . however, at limiting peptide concentrations dr1-expressing apc outperformed dr4-expressing apc in their stimulating capacity . natural processing of antigens generates a pool of peptides with different length   <cit>  and their intracellular loading into mhc-class ii molecules underlies editing by hla-dm  <cit> . similar to our synthetic, 12-mer art v 1-peptides, the peptides resulting from natural processing were also loaded efficiently into both dr1- and dr <dig> molecules as detected by the response of art v 125-36-specific t cells . here again, dr1-expressing apc performed better at lower peptide concentrations than dr4-expressing apc.

next, differences in the binding behaviour of art v 125- <dig> to dr1- and dr4-molecules and t cell stimulatory capacity were addressed. in vitro binding assays with isolated hla-molecules and single aa mutants of art v 125- <dig> confirmed peptide-binding to dr1-molecules with high affinity and residue i <dig> as p1-anchor  <cit> . moreover, we found a similar binding affinity and again i <dig> as p1-anchor for binding to dr4-molecules . the latter was consistent with our computer simulation data. notably, the residues at p <dig>  p <dig>  or p <dig>  which in general can bind to additional secondary binding pockets in the groove of dr <dig> and dr <dig>  had no measurable further supporting effects for art v 125- <dig> -binding to either dr molecule, again emphasizing the anchor role of i <dig>  a and g by nature do not provide suitable side chains for anchoring and also proved not to be relevant for t cell activation . on the other hand, e <dig>  turned out to be important for most t cell responses . this finding might indicate that, instead of interacting with the hla-molecule, e <dig> may interact with the tcr together with its neighbouring aa w <dig> . however, the calculated surface exposition  of e <dig>  obtained by computer modelling was relatively low  and rather suggested interaction with the mhc molecule. in this case, the simultaneous presence of the all-dominant i <dig> in the a30-mutant peptide apparently prevented in vitro detection of secondary mhc-binding residues.

overall, the position and number of art v 125-36-residues crucial for t cell reactivity was similar in response to dr1- or dr4-molecules and focussed on the  <dig> aa stretch from i <dig> to k <dig>  the indispensible residues e <dig>  w <dig> , k <dig>  are located in the core of the minimal epitopes found. less frequently q <dig>  and h <dig>  also formed part of the minimal epitopes . due to their increased flexibility and higher surface exposition of h <dig> in dr <dig> , these aa may contribute to a more intense tcr-interaction. an influence of peptide flanking residues  on t cell responses was also observed in a few experiments, but was not restricted to either dr1- or dr4-presentation.

although we found similar affinities and structures  for art v 125-36-binding to dr <dig> and dr <dig> , for more than 50% of the t cells the minimal epitope was shorter for the dr1-bound peptide . in silico, differences in peptide flexibility, indicated by rmsf, became obvious between art v 125- <dig> bound to hla-dr <dig> or hla-dr <dig> with advanced simulation time. in dr <dig> the peptide was more flexible at both ends and detached from the mhc-molecule at the c-terminus . in essence, the parts of the art v 1-peptide with lower ranges in rmsf, i. e. less flexibility, reflect the common core of the minimal peptide regions as defined by our in vitro experiments for dr <dig>  or dr <dig> . thus these peptide ranges might define the parts of art v 125- <dig> buried in the mhc-binding groove. further indications for structural differences between the art v 125- <dig> /dr <dig> or -dr <dig> complex were the overall discrepancies obtained for surface exposition . as compared to dr <dig>  the c-terminal aa residues in dr <dig> were more solvent-exposed, while the n-terminal residues were less exposed. in addition, k <dig> at position p <dig>  classically the central solvent tcr-exposed residue in mhc class ii  <cit> , showed a markedly higher sasa value in complex with dr <dig> than with dr <dig>  these differences may indicate better access of the tcr to the core and c-terminus of the art v 1-peptide in dr <dig> 

our simulations were based on the crystal structure of the 13-mer peptide hiv gag p <dig> 34- <dig> pevipmfsalseg bound to hla-drb1* <dig> . interestingly, a congruent crystal structure exists  representing hla-drb1*01: <dig> with the 15-mer peptide hiv gag p <dig> 34- <dig> containing  <dig> additional c-terminal aa residues . while the 13 n-terminal residues of the peptide show an essentially identical spatial arrangement as the art v 1-complex at the initial configuration  <cit> , these two residues reach out of the mhc binding groove and build a hairpin turn which has been reported to be essential for t cell recognition of this hiv gag p24–epitope  <cit> . intriguingly, this hairpin structure resembles certain sub-states of the detached c-terminal end of the art v 125- <dig> / hla-drb1*01: <dig> complex as shown in figure  <dig>  within  <dig> published crystal structures of pmhc class ii molecules that contain at least short peptide flanking regions, we found in about 10% of them structures divergent from the canonical stretched conformation such as detachments, loop-like structures or hairpin turns. these structures most likely are important for t cell reactivity. we have previously reported effects of such protruding peptide segments on t cell activation for peptide flanking regions  <cit>  and altered peptide ligands with high sequence similarity  <cit> . thus, we suggest that the c-terminal art v 125-36-residues protruding from the peptide binding groove are relevant for interactions with tcr in vivo.

an alternative interpretation for the lack of dr4-responses to art v  <dig> in the population may be a potential negative influence of flanking regions in naturally processed peptides selectively on hla-dr <dig>  however, the fact that dr1-restricted t cells also respond well to naturally processed, dr4-presented art v  <dig>  at optimum concentrations indicates that these effects would only be of minor relevance.

in summary, compared to dr <dig>  dr <dig> allowed t cell activation of shorter minimal epitopes within art v 125- <dig> and at lower peptide concentrations. however, the differences obtained in our experimental assays may not clearly explain the high association of art v 125-36-recognition and hla-drb1* <dig>  we used allergen-specific effector t cells with a very high sensitivity for antigen-specific activation in our study. however, the threshold level for activation of naïve t cells is much higher. therefore, we suggest that at much lower allergen-concentrations, i.e. at conditions present in the human body, the observed differences become much more relevant in vivo, so that dr1- but not dr4-expressing apc are capable of activating cognate t cells. this assumption would be backed by the fact that we could not establish dr4-restricted tcc from any of our dr4-expressing mugwort-allergic patients.

CONCLUSIONS
we used the t cell response to the immunodominant epitope of art v  <dig> as a model to study p/mhc/tcr interactions in order to explain why a peptide with degenerate mhc-class ii binding behaviour causes primarily hla-dr1-restricted immune responses. the combination of experimental and in silico data suggested that tcr recognition of this peptide in the context of dr <dig> may be promoted by distinctive structural features in the pmhc complex leading e.g. to superior tcr accessibility and preferential priming in vivo.
