BACKGROUND
aphids are phloem-feeding insects that cause substantial damage to agriculture worldwide due to feeding-related damage and the transmission of economically important plant viruses  <cit> . effective control of aphids in field crops currently relies heavily on the use of insecticides. however, aphids have been shown to develop resistance to many of the different types of available insecticides . in addition, there are an increasing number of restrictions in place on the use of insecticides under eu legislation due to their environmental impact  <cit> . therefore, there is a pressing need to develop novel aphid control strategies, which requires a better understanding of the molecular basis of plant-aphid interactions.

among the over  <dig> aphid species, around 10 % are considered pests of economically important plants and trees  <cit> . while most aphid species are highly specialized and can only infest plants in a single taxonomic family or several related plant species, some aphid species have an exceptionally broad host range and are able to infest plants in many families  <cit> . the latter group of aphid species includes some major pests, like myzus persicae , which infests plants in over  <dig> families, including crops like potato and oil seed rape  <cit> . in contrast, a close relative of m. persicae, m. cerasi , is only able to infest cherry and a few herbaceous plants. also, some aphids, like rhopalosiphum padi , mainly infest cereals. interestingly, we previously showed that aphid species m. persicae, m. cerasi and r. padi exhibited probing behaviour on arabidopsis thaliana during host, poor-host as well as nonhost interactions  <cit> . this implies that during these different types of interactions there is an opportunity for molecular interactions to take place. moreover, we found that arabidopsis transcriptional responses to these three aphid species showed a high level of overlap, suggesting that also aphid responses likely play a key role during the different types of interactions. although the molecular mechanisms underlying aphid host range differences remain elusive, it is likely both plant and aphid molecules are involved  <cit> .

for a plant pathogen or pest to be successful on a host, it is important to manipulate host cell processes to promote virulence. this generally involves the secretion of molecules, termed effectors, inside the host, which target host molecules  <cit> . a number of recent studies have now shown that insects, including aphids, produce and secrete effectors that suppress or induce plant defence responses . these aphid effectors are thought to be produced predominantly in the salivary glands and secreted within aphid saliva during probing and feeding . the recent availability of aphid genome and transcriptome sequence data has facilitated the development of approaches to identify aphid candidate effectors . more specifically, bioinformatic pipelines to identify putative secreted proteins have been developed e.g.  <cit>  and applied to several aphid species . in addition, saliva collection methods based on artificial diet-feeding systems in combination with mass spectrometry have allowed the identification of proteins present in saliva of several aphid species  <cit> . these efforts have generated lists of candidate effector proteins for a number of species and led to the functional characterization of several candidates in plant-aphid interactions.

we were interested to gain a comprehensive insight into the diversity of aphid effector repertoires of species with varying host ranges. therefore, we employed a combined transcriptomic and saliva proteomic approach to identify and compare the effector repertoires from three different aphid species, m. persicae, m. cerasi and r. padi. for m. persicae, we included three different genotypes to also assess variation within this species. these were genotype o, which is currently most prevalent in the uk, genotype j which was prevalent in the uk around  <dig> but is currently only found occasionally, and genotype f, which was prevalent in  <dig> but is not currently found . these genotypes show differences in growth rates on different host species, with genotype f showing a significantly slower growth on all host species compared to other genotypes  <cit> .

we found a large number of predicted secreted aphid proteins to be highly conserved among the different aphid species, which we propose reflects the potential aphid core effector repertoire. many proteins within this repertoire were predicted to be of unknown function and specific to aphids. therefore, these proteins may exhibit highly conserved functions important in establishing plant-aphid interactions. in addition, we identified sets of effectors that were highly divergent among the different aphid species and/or genotypes, as well effectors potentially specific to one of the aphid species. some of these effectors showed evidence of positive selection. we propose that such effectors are strong candidates for contributing to aphid species-specific infestation strategies.

RESULTS
de novo rna-seq data assembly
to define the effector repertoires from aphid species m. persicae , m. cerasi and r. padi, we sequenced libraries generated using rna extracted from both body and head tissues. quality control and de novo assembly was performed for each species and genotype. we performed differential gene expression analyses by mapping reads for each biological replicate dataset back to the assemblies and then generated normalised digital gene expression  . details on the numbers of assembled contigs, reads, predicted coding sequences  and differentially expressed genes are summarised in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> diagrammatic representation of the experimental procedure used to identify putative effectors from myzus persicae genotype o, j and f, m. cerasi and rhopalosiphum padi.  aphids were dissected into biological replicas of heads and separately bodies . rna was extracted and subjected to illumina hiseq sequencing. following quality control  and assembly, differential expression was performed to identify transcripts upregulated in head samples that encoded predicted signal peptides. these were categorised as putative effectors.  aphid saliva was collected in artificial feeding chambers. the saliva was subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis. the resulting data was interrogated against the transcriptome assemblies in order to identify salivary secreted proteins. these were categorised as putative effectors.  reciprocal best blast hit analysis was used to identity 1: <dig> ratio orthologues between m. persicae genotype o, j and f, m. cerasi, r. padi, acyrthosiphon pisum and aphis glycines. clustering of the 1: <dig> ratio orthologous sequences was performed and where the resulting orthologous clusters contained a putative effector, they were subjected to dn/ds analysis. clusters with a dn/ds value greater than  <dig> were identified as potentially under selection pressure.  whole transcriptome clustering based on sequence similarity using blast and mcl, using the species listed above including drosophila melanogaster, was used to identify clusters of putative effectors and those which maybe novel, termed pioneers in this study

predicted unigenes from the de novo assemblies were subjected to blast searches against the ncbi nr database  to annotate the transcript coding sequences  and identify potential contaminants through kingdom assignment. in summary, the de novo r. padi rna-seq assembly resulted in the prediction of  <dig>  cds, of which  <dig> did not have any blast hit  . the majority  of cds showed similarity to acyrthosiphon pisum , for which the genome sequence is available  <cit> . only  <dig> sequences were identified as viral, and matched to putative replicase proteins from the insect virus euprosterna elaeasa, and  <dig> sequences were bacterial, including  <dig> sequences from the aphid endosymbiont buchnera. the number of transcripts assembled for r. padi was substantially less than that of the other assemblies, likely due to the lower number of reads generated for this species. for m. cerasi we identified  <dig>  unigene cds, with 76 % showing blast hits to a. pisum. the m. cerasi cds set included  <dig> viral sequences, and  <dig> bacterial sequences of which  <dig> were buchnera-derived. for the m. persicae genotypes the numbers of cds ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with around 90 % showing blast hits against a. pisum. the number of sequences with similarity to insect viruses ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the number of bacterial sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> to  <dig> being derived from buchnera. we also identified a number of transcripts that showed blast hits to plant genes . however, it is unclear whether these transcripts are incorrectly annotated in the database or whether they are indeed present in insect tissue. we also found a number of secondary blast hits against clostridium sordellii sequences from one particular dataset   <cit> , which included hits for some well characterized aphid effectors, such as mpc <dig> and me <dig>  however, additional blast searches showed that these aphid effectors do not show any hits against other bacterial databases, including other clostridium datasets. also effectors like c <dig> contain introns and are confirmed to be aphid derived using various independent approaches, including proteomics and genomics . the relatively high number of matches to a specific c. sordellii database is therefore unlikely due to contamination of our samples.

we used our de novo transcriptome datasets as well as the a. pisum genome sequence, and the publicly available transcriptome datasets for aphis glycines   <cit>  and a. gossypii   <cit> , for phylogenetic analyses to assess the relationships of the different aphid species used in this study. we selected a set of single copy orthologous genes described by misof et al.  <cit>  for reciprocal best blast hit and phylogenetic analyses . as expected the two different myzus species were more closely related to each other than to the other species in the phylogenetic tree . also, the three m. persicae genotypes clustered together, with genotype o being phylogenetically closer to genotype j than genotype f .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree from maximum likelihood analysis of an alignment of  <dig> eog genes per species using  <dig> bootstraps



in addition, we looked at the predicted functions of the most abundant transcripts for each aphid species and genotype. annotation of the  <dig> most abundant transcripts in the  transcriptome datasets revealed a high level of similarity across the species/genotypes . for example ribosomal proteins, cuticle proteins, atp synthases, elongation factor 1-alpha, myosin light chain protein, putative sheath protein, chemosensory proteins, and heat shock-associated proteins were present in the  <dig> most abundant transcripts for all species. interestingly, we identified transcripts with sequence similarity to several previously identified putative aphid effectors among the  <dig> most abundant transcripts. for most aphid species/genotypes we identified transcript sequences with similarity to effector me <dig> from macrosiphum euphorbiae , which has previously been shown to promote aphid virulence  <cit> . moreover, we also identified several transcripts in the various datasets with similarity to candidate effectors, including mp <dig> , mp <dig> , mp <dig> , mp <dig> , mp <dig> , and mpc <dig>   <cit> . the high level of overlap in predicted functions of the most abundant transcripts for the different aphid species reflects their importance to aphid biology. although we identified transcripts with similarity to several known putative effectors for the myzus species, we only identified one previously predicted effector sequence  in the r. padi top  <dig> transcript set. it is possible this aphid species utilizes a different effectors repertoire than myzus species during plant infestation.

prediction of putative effector repertoires from different aphid species
effectors are thought to be expressed and synthesised in the salivary glands, which are located in the aphid head  <cit> . aphid species vary in size and therefore dissection of salivary gland tissues to use for transcriptome analyses is challenging and not always feasible. to be able to identify transcripts encoding putative effectors for the different aphid species, which are most likely expressed in the salivary glands, we compared datasets generated from aphid head versus body tissues and looked for transcripts that were up-regulated in head tissue.

first, we identified transcripts up-regulated in head versus body tissues and vice versa for each species . then, we applied a bioinformatics pipeline to these transcript sets to identify transcripts up-regulated in aphid heads that are predicted to encode secreted proteins. this identified  <dig> transcripts for m. cerasi,  <dig> for r. padi,  <dig> for m. persicae genotype o,  <dig> for m. persicae genotype f, and  <dig> for m. persicae genotype j . in addition we predicted the presence of nuclear localization signals , which identified  <dig> to  <dig> predicted secreted proteins with a predicted nuclear localization . interestingly, these results show variation in numbers of predicted effectors within m. persicae. for example, for genotype f we nearly predicted twice the number of effectors as compared to genotype o despite similar numbers of total cds. whether these differences are due to the quality of the assembly or reflect any biological relevance remains to be investigated.

in parallel, we examined the gene expression profiles of a set of genes commonly used for normalisation of qpcr data and thought to be constitutively expressed  <cit> . sequences annotated as elongation factor  <dig> alpha, actin, succinate dehydrogenase and cdc <dig>  were selected for assessment of their expression profiles. of the  <dig> aphid gene sequences we identified using sequence similarity searches to these select genes, only  <dig> were found to be differentially expressed . one was an actin transcript, and the other three were succinate dehydrogenase transcripts. however, two out of the three differentially expressed succinate dehydrogenase genes were only expressed, to low levels, in one of the aphid samples  with no expression in the other samples, thus leading to differential expression . some actin genes could be affected in their expression by differences in aphid growth. similarly, actin was highly expressed in j <dig> nematodes versus those in other life stages in the case of globodera pallida  <cit> . despite this,  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts did not show any differential gene expression within our dataset indicating that these genes are not regulated similarly to those in our candidate effector sets.

previous studies have identified salivary proteins in aphids using proteomics and/or bioinformatics approaches  <cit> . we compared the predicted aphid effectors identified by bos et al.  <cit> , atamian et al.  <cit> , and carolan et al.  <cit>  to the datasets we generated in this study and found similar sequences for many of the previously identified candidate effectors . for example, we identified sequences similar to previously identified effectors c <dig>  <cit>  and me <dig>  <cit> , to the candidate effectors identified by bos et al.  <cit>  and to  <dig> candidate effectors described by carolan et al.  <cit>  based on a blastp cut-off of 1e- <dig> .

go annotations were assigned and go enrichment analyses revealed an over-representation in the predicted effector repertoires of all species of the functional categories “structural molecule activity” and “constituent of cuticle and extracellular region” . however, many putative effectors identified to date from different pathosystems have no known go domains  <cit> . therefore these go-term data may not reflect the biological function of a large number of aphid predicted effectors.

we then looked at blast similarity searches of our predicted effector repertoires to look at putative functions . interestingly, we identified two predicted aphid effectors from m. persicae with similarity to a pea aphid e <dig> ubiquitin ligase . these enzymes are important components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is implicated in a wide range of plant-pathogen interactions and it is possible that aphids exploit this pathway in order to manipulate host responses  <cit> .

also, we identified putative effectors with potential roles in detoxification and digestion . it has been suggested that aphids secrete cellulase enzymes in order to minimise the mechanical damage caused during stylet movement  <cit> . we did not find cellulase enzymes or any other glycosyl hydrolase  domain containing protein involved in cell wall degradation in our predicted effector repertoires. however, when interrogating the whole transcriptome, rather than the effector repertoire sets, we found  <dig> transcripts corresponding to gh <dig> domain cellulases , of which  <dig> were predicted to encode secreted proteins. however, these transcripts were similarly expressed in body and head tissues. it is possible that some effectors may be produced in other tissues than the salivary glands and are then transported to the salivary duct and secreted into saliva. therefore, our selection of candidate effectors based on high expression levels in head versus body tissues may have missed some potential effectors of interest. moreover, secreted enzymes in the aphid digestive tract are likely involved in the detoxification and degradation of plant compounds  <cit> .

carolan et al.  <cit>  previously identified some similarity between nematode effectors and predicted pea aphid effectors based on functional annotations. we assessed our datasets for such similarity and identified sequences with predicted functions similar to those of several root knot nematode effectors  . in addition, we compared amino acid sequences within our candidate effector sets to the predicted effector repertoire of the cyst nematode globodera pallida  <cit> . we only found m. persicae sequences with similarity to three proteins, which are potentially part of a family  and are predicted to encode a gland cell secretory protein  <dig>  which contains a thioredoxin-like domain, and shows similarity to a protein with a kinase domain  . overall, there is very little, if no, convergent evolution between the effectors repertoires of the aphid species used in this study and those of plant pathogenic nematodes.

we also compared our findings to transcriptome studies aimed at identifying salivary gland genes from other sap-sucking insects within the order hempitera, such as the potato leafhopper empoasca fabae  <cit> , the whitefly bemisia tabaci  <cit> , and the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens  <cit> . genes with functions predicted to be involved in plant-hemipteran interactions, that may have similar roles to those identified in this study, include peroxidases  <cit> , sucrase  <cit> , peptidase, lipase  <cit> , phosphatase  <cit> , glucose dehydrogenase  <cit>  and a number of hypothetical pea aphid proteins. previously it has been shown that some predicted secretory salivary proteins from the whitefly show similarity to putative pea aphid effectors  <cit> . for example, predicted whitefly effectors showed similarity to an gmc oxireductase, glucose dehydrogenase, mp <dig>  mp <dig>  mp <dig>  mp <dig>  mp <dig>  sucrase, and m <dig> zinc metalloprotease  <cit> . moreover, comparative analyses between a planthopper salivary gland transcriptome and the pea aphid identified number of similar sequences which may function in insect-plant interactions such as a glucose dehydrogenase, peroxidase-like, vitellogenin-6-like, serine protease snake-like isoform  <dig> carboxypeptidase, and digestive enzymes  <cit> . this shows that these insects may use some common proteins in order to successfully infest their hosts. however, a large number of aphid putative effectors identified here are aphid specific, consistent with previous research  <cit> , indicating aphid specific evolution.

prediction of putative effectors using saliva proteomics
complementary to our transcriptomics approach we performed aphid saliva proteomics for the three aphid species/genotypes in our study to identify candidate effectors. we collected saliva using an artificial feeding system  <cit>  and subjected samples to lc-ms/ms analyses. mascot software searches for peptide identification were run against the de novo assemblies generated in this project . in total we identified  <dig> proteins in the saliva of r. padi,  <dig> proteins in the saliva of m. cerasi, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins in saliva of m. persicae genotypes f, o and j, respectively . the differences in protein numbers could reflect that these aphid species produce variable amounts of saliva when exposed to artificial feeding system or that they secrete effector repertoires with different complexities.

also, we also performed mascot searches using the ncbi nr database, which led to a relatively small number of proteins being identified when compared using the de novo assemblies . more specifically, we only identified  <dig> proteins for r. padi,  <dig> for m. cerasi,  <dig> for m. persicae genotype f,  <dig> for m. persicae genotype o, and  <dig> for m. persicae genotype j. this highlights the importance of generating de novo transcriptomes for different species in applying a proteomics approach for protein identification.

out of  <dig> proteins identified for the different species and genotypes in total, only  <dig> contained predicted signal peptides with no transmembrane domain. nineteen of these were in our predicted aphid effector datasets based on rna-seq analyses. overall this shows that based on our analyses less than one third of the  <dig> proteins contain secretion signals, and that only a small number of candidate effectors were identified by both the proteomics and transcriptomics approach. when assessing the gene expression profiles of the candidate effectors identified by proteomics we found that the majority of corresponding transcript where more highly expressed in head versus body tissue . however, when applying statistical analyses we found that for only  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins the transcripts were significantly more abundant in head tissues. lack of differential expression therefore partly explains the lack of correlation between our effector sets defined by rna-seq and proteomics approaches.

another reason for the lack of overlap could be missing 5′-sequences in our transcriptome dataset required for prediction of signal peptide sequences. we performed an overall assessment of the de novo assemblies for full-length transcripts using transdecoder. out of  <dig>  r. padi predicted transcripts only  <dig> were predicted to be complete ,  <dig>  were internal ,  <dig> were 5′-partial , and  <dig> were 3′-partial . similar numbers were obtained for the other aphid species and genotypes. in addition, we assessed whether full-length transcript sequences were available for the  <dig> proteins identified by proteomics within the de novo assemblies generated for each species. for the  <dig> r. padi proteins identified by proteomics, we only found full-length transcript data for  <dig> proteins, which limited our ability to predict signal peptide sequences. twelve out of the  <dig> proteins were predicted to contain a signal peptide, with  <dig> of these containing transmembrane domains. for m. cerasi, full-length transcripts were available for  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins identified by proteomics. ten proteins contained signal peptide sequences, of which  <dig> contained transmembrane domains. for the m. persicae genotypes we found that full-length transcripts were available for about 50 % of the proteins identified by proteomics.

we then compared functional annotations of saliva proteins from the different aphid species. we found that a putative sheath protein , several uncharacterized proteins , and a peroxidase-like , were secreted by all aphid species. whereas uncharacterized protein  and trehalase-like isoform x <dig>  were found in saliva from all myzus species, including all genotypes. glutathione s-transferase  and uncharacterized protein  were identified only in saliva from the different m. persicae genotypes. twenty-two proteins were found only in saliva from r. padi such as c <dig>  nine hypothetical/unknown proteins, carbonic anhydrase and proteins with proteolytic activity such as aminopeptidase and cathepsin b- <dig> . it is possible that this aphid secretes different effectors into the artificial diet, but we cannot rule out that observed differences are due to differences in saliva amounts secreted and quality of the rna-seq datasets used for identification of peptides.

although, we cannot draw conclusions regarding the presence or absence of certain proteins in saliva of specific species due to the lack of biological and technical replication in our experimental set-up, our data does support a model wherein different aphids secrete a core or common effector set inside their host to manipulate host processes. within the common set of secreted saliva proteins, those predicted to encode enzymes may be involved in detoxification of chemical defences compounds induced during early plant defence responses to reduce harmful levels of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . detoxification of plant defence responses may be a common strategy employed by aphids and identifying and characterizing any common/core proteins involved in this could provide novel broad range targets for aphid control strategies.

cluster analysis to identify core effector sets
one of our key interests in this study was to compare the predicted aphid effector repertoires to identify common or core sets of candidate effectors as well as those potentially unique to specific species and/or genotypes, or highly divergent across species. to do this, we used the transcriptome and proteomics datasets for r. padi, m. cerasi, and m. persicae generated here in combination with publicly available sequence data sets for a. pisum  <cit> , a. glycines  <cit> , as well as the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , for cluster analyses. the transcriptome of a. glycines was re-assembled for our study.

to perform cluster analysis based on sequence similarity, a database of all amino acid sequences from all species listed above was generated, including several previously published candidate effector sets  <cit> . this amino acid database was subjected to a self-blastp  similarity search followed by cluster analyses using mcl . clusters containing any of the candidate effectors identified by our transcriptomics or proteomics approach or previously reported  <cit>  were defined as candidate effector containing-clusters. we identified  <dig> candidate effector containing-clusters represented by  <dig> sequences out of the total  <dig>  clusters represented by  <dig>  sequences. within the candidate effector containing-clusters we looked for those that were represented by  <dig> of the  <dig> aphid datasets, and defined these as core effectors . this identified  <dig> core putative effector clusters containing  <dig> sequences . similarity searches revealed that these core putative effectors showed high similarity to proteins with a range of different functions, such as a glucose dehydrogenase, sheath protein, apolipophorin precursor as well as previously reported aphid candidate effectors of unknown function .

many of the predicted core effectors encode enzymes with predicted functions in detoxification or digestion. however, we also identified predicted effectors that have no sequence similarity to proteins of known functions, of which some are aphid-specific. importantly, our cluster analyses revealed similarity of core effectors to a significant number of previously identified candidate effectors. these include m. persicae effector mp <dig>  which triggers a range of plant defences and reduces aphid virulence when over-expressed in planta  <cit> . two clusters contained effectors with known virulence activity, mpc <dig> and me <dig>  c <dig> is one of the best-characterized aphid effectors and the m. persicae form of c <dig>  called mpc <dig>  contributes to aphid virulence as shown by a combination of in planta overexpression and rnai experiments  <cit> . in addition, the m. euphorbiae effector me <dig> enhances aphids virulence upon in planta over-expression  <cit> .

identification of potential aphid species-specific candidate effectors
in addition to the conserved effectors, we also looked for any mcl clusters that contained candidate effector sequences with no blast hit against the ncbi nr database  or pfam a domains specific to a single aphid species or genus. these were defined as pioneer candidate effectors. we found  <dig> clusters corresponding to  <dig> sequences specific to r. padi, and  <dig> clusters corresponding to  <dig> sequences specific to m. persicae. we found  <dig> clusters, containing  <dig> sequences that were specifically represented by the two myzus species . these pioneer candidate effectors were all predicted based on our transcriptomics analyses and therefore showed significantly higher expression in head samples than in body samples .

to determine whether these potentially species-specific effectors are indeed species-specific further characterization will be required. this will address whether m. persicae-specific effectors contribute to host range and whether the cereal pest r. padi requires specific effectors to successfully infest cereals.

dn/ds analysis identifies candidate effectors under positive selection
in addition to species-specific effectors, aphids may secrete different variants of effectors involved in host interactions. for example, some aphid effectors may have evolved and exhibit diversity reflecting co-evolution of specific plant and aphid species. to determine if the putative effectors identified in this study were under selection pressure, the ratio of the number of nonsynoymous substitutions to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  was calculated for reciprocal best blast  hit orthologous groups . first, we generated a reciprocal best blast hit putative 1: <dig> orthologous group network, by performing reciprocal best blast hit analyses  using the different aphid transcriptome datasets . a network was generated from the resulting hits . we calculated dn/ds ratios for each rbbh group containing a putative effector and identified those that scored a dn/ds ratio > <dig>  indicative of positive selection . since our analysis is based on transcriptome rather than genome sequencing data, we were unable to take potential gene duplication into consideration, which is known to occur within aphid genomes  <cit> . however, previously identified effectors such as c <dig>  mp <dig> and me <dig> are single copy genes based on blast searches against the published pea aphid genome.table  <dig> reciprocal best blast hit analysis identified 1: <dig> orthologues between the transcriptomes. the resulting clusters, if they contained a putative effector were subjected to dn/ds analysis to identify any clusters under positive selection . those identified as possibly under selection are listed in the table

in total we identified  <dig> orthologous groups in our rbbh network that contained a candidate effector based on our own analyses and several published candidate effector sets  <cit>  out of a total of  <dig>  groups. out of these  <dig> groups,  <dig> were identified as being under positive selection  . in parallel, we selected a set of  <dig> sequences corresponding to genes not expected to be under positive selection based on their predicted conserved function in aphids  for similar analyses. this generated  <dig> groups and dn/ds ratios < <dig> , showing that none of these conserved genes were under positive selection. a further  <dig> groups corresponding to predicted eog genes   <cit> , also thought to be single copy, were subjected to dn/ds analysis. three groups had dn/ds >  <dig>  which we consider false positives, and correspond to  <dig>  % of the eog set. in contrast,  <dig>  % of the putative effector containing clusters were found to have dn/ds >  <dig> . however, we cannot rule out that some of these clusters actually represent gene duplicates rather than orthologs of single copy genes.

putative effector clusters were checked to see if they contained single copy genes within the pea aphid genome. of the  <dig> putative effector clusters under positive selection,  <dig> included an a. pisum sequence. to examine if these  <dig> aphid genes are represented by a single copy in the published a. pisum genome, their protein sequences were subjected to blastp searches against the predicted a. pisum protein set, excluding the expected self-matches. three out of the  <dig> sequences returned hits when using a 70 % identity cut off, reflecting perhaps recent gene duplication, whilst  <dig> returned hits when using a 30 % identity cut-off, suggesting that at least  <dig> sequences are likely single copy.

the candidate effector group with the highest dn/ds ratio  included a protein of unknown function identified in the saliva of m. persicae . the amino acid sequences in this cluster are mainly conserved in the n-terminal region. the c-terminal  <dig> amino acid region, which is predicted to be under the greatest positive selection pressure shows  <dig> amino acid differences between the genotype f and o .

one group, containing m. persicae candidate effector mp <dig>  <cit>  was conserved within m. persicae genotypes, but divergent between m. persicae and m. cerasi  . we also identified a group, containing m. persicae candidate effector mp <dig>  with a dn/ds ratio of  <dig>  that shows high conservation within m. persicae, but variation between the two different myzus species . the sequences from these two species contain  <dig> nucleotide differences that correspond to  <dig> amino acid differences. this is also the case for mp <dig> cluster, which is conserved in m. persicae but shows significant variation when compared to the pea aphid sequence .fig.  <dig> orthologues sequences for previously identified effector were identified by reciprocal best blast hit analysis. dn/ds analysis identified clusters under positive selection pressure. a sites which are most likely to be under positive selection  are marked by boxes on the amino acid alignment for cluster containing mp <dig> . b orthologues for mp <dig> were identified as being under positive selection. sites most likely to be under positive selection  are marked with boxes 



for the rbbh group containing the aphid effector c <dig>  <cit>  we removed the n-terminal repeat region, which is highly variable in length among different aphid species, prior to dn/ds analyses. the full-length m. persicae form of c <dig>  here called mpc <dig>  contains  <dig> repeat motifs ), which are important for virulence activity  <cit> . our m. persicae transcriptome analyses identified variants with 2– <dig> repeat motifs. it is unclear whether this variation results from assembly artefacts or whether this is genuine variation. mpc <dig> is a single copy gene encoded on the negative strand that contains a 105 bp exon, followed by a 2264 bp intron, followed by a 719 bp exon, followed by a 2498 bp intron, followed by a final 72 bp exon that is poorly supported by rna-seq data . the repeat amino acid motifs are encoded within the 719 bp exon, with no evidence of any intron regions around this area for splicing to occur. m. cerasi c <dig> transcripts differ in this region, but again encode for a variable length repeat motif, composed of one nddqgev motif followed by four or five repeats of the ndnqgev motif. no repeat motifs were found in r. padi c <dig>  and this form was highly divergent from the m. persicae and m. cerasi forms and therefore did not fall within the c <dig> rbbh group. the dn/ds  value for the c <dig> cluster was based on variations seen between m. persicae and m. cerasi. the sequences corresponding to c <dig> within these species contained  <dig> nucleotide differences corresponding to  <dig> amino acid changes within the  <dig> amino acid region following the repeat motifs ).fig.  <dig> analysis of c <dig> sequences identified. a mpc <dig> is a single copy gene encoded on the negative strand by three exons. the height of the histogram-graph lines represents the relative depth of rna-seq coverage and therefore where the exon boundaries are. within the 719 bp exon, variant transcripts, which contain 2– <dig> repeat motifs, are encoded. b the variant motif region for transcripts from myzus persicae genotype o. c reciprocal best blast hit analysis identified orthologues on a 1: <dig> ratio between the transcriptomes of c <dig>  the c <dig> cluster was subjected to dn/ds analysis  was identified as being under selection pressure . the sites most likely to be under selection pressure  are marked on the alignment by boxes




as mentioned above, sequences similar to m. euphorbiae effector me <dig>  <cit>  were among those most highly expressed in all species included within this study. our rbbh and dn/ds analyses revealed the me10-like sequences are under positive selection .

we also identified several rbbh groups that contained sequences under positive selection among the different m. persicae genotypes . for example, group_ <dig>  with similarity to a. pisum xm_ <dig> , showed high levels of variation between m. persicae genotype f and the other two genotypes. also, in group_ <dig>  which is annotated as a glucose dehydrogenase, we found variation between m. persicae genotypes. interestingly we found sites under positive selection that fall within gmc oxireductase domains . mutations in these domains may be important for co-evolution with host plants in a changing environment. we also identified several pioneer effectors as being under positive selection. these were included in group_ <dig>  which contained m. persicae specific sequences and group_ <dig>  which only contains sequences from m. persicae and m. cerasi . this highlights these pioneers are interesting sequences for further investigation.fig.  <dig> sequences identified from the saliva of aphid species myzus persicae via mass spectrometry analysis were identified as being under positive selection . these were annotated as glucose dehydrogenase acceptor-like . we found sites most likely to be under positive selection fall within gmc oxireductase pfam domains . these sites are marked on the alignment by boxes. mutations in these domains may be important for co-evolution with host plants in a changing environment



among the  <dig> rbbh groups we identified as potentially being under positive selection,  <dig> contained just the three m. persicae genotypes . in particular, we identified predicted effector variants within the transcriptome of genotype f that were different to those from the other genotypes. compared to genotypes j and o, this f genotype is slow with regards to reproduction rates in several host plant species tested  <cit> . whether this slow reproduction can be due to differences in aphid predicted effector repertoires is speculative, and remains to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we employed a combination of transcriptomics and saliva proteomics in order to identify and compare the putative effector repertoires from three aphid species. we have identified putative conserved effector sets, which are predicted to exhibit similar functions in different plant-aphid interactions. such conserved effectors could be useful targets for the development of alternative control methods to provide broad range aphid control. furthermore, we identified more diverse putative effector sets, which may be important for specific plant-aphid interactions and therefore in determining aphid host range.
