BACKGROUND
chromosomes occupy specific regions in the three-dimensional  interphase nucleus, so-called chromosome territories   <cit> . the radial arrangement of cts shows cell-type specific differences  <cit> . the arrangement of cts is influenced by many factors, such as chromosome size, gene density and transcription. in lymphocytes, chromosomes with a high gene-density are located further towards the center of the nucleus whereas chromosomes with a lower gene-density are concentrated at the nuclear periphery  <cit> . transcription is also thought to play an important role in ct arrangement, with transcriptionally active genes usually located on the edge or outside of cts and inactive genes found in the interior  <cit> . gene expression can also cause chromatin movement in the 3d nucleus, as active genes may loop out of their ct altogether, presumably to access a transcription factory  <cit> . the correlation between the radial distribution of cts and factors such as gene density, replication timing and transcription were examined by küpper et al.  <cit> . they found that, in human cell nuclei, gene-density has a dominant impact on the radial distribution of cts. in mouse cell nuclei other factors like guanine-cytosine content may, however, play a more important role in determining the radial distribution  <cit> .

the position of each ct is established early in g <dig> and is maintained throughout interphase with minimal constrained diffusion  <cit> . changes in the position of cts have, however, been observed during cell differentiation, senescence and tumorigenesis. this occurs for example during adipocyte  <cit>  and human epidermal keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . in human fibroblasts, chromosome positions change when a cell becomes quiescent, senescent or when it re-enters the cell cycle  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated chromosome orientation for the first time in the mouse 3d nucleus. we used multicolor banding . a mband paint labels regions of a single chromosome with different fluorochromes. these different stains ensure that the centromeric end, telomeric end and interstitial regions can be differentiated from each other. in the 3d nucleus, the location of each region, and ultimately the orientation of the whole chromosome can, therefore, be determined. mbanding is commonly used to study intrachromosomal changes in single chromosomes  <cit> , but can also be applied in studies of nuclear architecture. using mband probes, the degree of condensation of human chromosome  <dig> was determined in both interphase and metaphase  <cit> , more recently the orientation of human chromosomes in sperm nuclei were analyzed  <cit> . in the latter study, the radial positions of all  <dig> cts and their axial vs. non-axial as well as their linear vs. non-linear, orientations with respect to the sperm tail were determined, as well as the internal organization of chromosome subregions defined by different mband probes. a predominantly size-dependent radial arrangement was found for entire cts. in addition, in particular for the smaller chromosomes, the authors also reported a gene density correlated orientation. taken together, their study did not identify a preferential internal orientation of cts with regard to the telomeric and centromeric end.

our aim was to determine and compare the orientation of chromosome  <dig> in a diploid mouse preb lymphocyte cell line and in primary b lymphocytes of congenic n wild-type mice. chromosome  <dig> is a gene dense chromosome  <cit> . the mband paint labels regions of chromosome  <dig> with four different fluorochromes. after fluorescence in situ hybridization  on 3d preserved cell nuclei, the location of centromeric, telomeric and interstitial regions and the orientation of chromosome  <dig> were visually determined for  <dig> nuclei per cell type. we observed three main patterns of chromosome  <dig> orientations. one arrangement involved chromosome  <dig> in parallel with the nuclear border, with neither the telomeric nor centromeric end pointing towards the nuclear center. alternatively, the telomeric or the centromeric end of chromosome  <dig> were found pointing towards the nuclear center. our data show that there is no significant difference between the frequencies of these three patterns of chromosome  <dig> orientations in both types of mouse b lymphocytes studied.

RESULTS
the mbanding technique was used to study the nuclear organization of chromosome  <dig> in a diploid mouse pre b lymphocyte line of balb/c origin  <cit>  and in b lymphocytes of congenic n wild-type mice  <cit> . we visualized mbanded chromosome  <dig> in metaphase preparations and chromosome territory   <dig> in 3d nuclei. over  <dig> nuclei of both preb and n wild-type mouse lymphocytes were imaged using axiovision  <dig>  software . after deconvolution using a constrained iterative algorithm  <cit> , all nuclei were analyzed by visual inspection to determine the orientation of both chromosome  <dig> homologs. to validate these results, we performed a semi-quantitative analysis of the radial arrangement of individual mband probe distributions on a subset of  <dig> nuclei per cell type using eads software  <cit> . the 3d conformation of  <dig> individual chromosomes  <dig> from each of the two cell types was determined by measuring angles between the geometric centers of the different mband probes in individual chromosome territories. to determine whether cell cycle distribution had an impact on the chromosome  <dig> orientation patterns seen, cell cycle profiles of both b cell types were measured by facs analysis.

chromosome  <dig> mbanding in pre b and t38h wt metaphase preparations
mouse chromosome  <dig> is approximately 122 mb in size and has a mean gene density of  <dig>  genes/mb  <cit> . the mband probe set divides chromosome  <dig> into four overlapping segments, as illustrated in figure 1a. the pericentromeric region is labeled with texas red, the proximal interstitial region in gold, the distal interstitial region with deac and the telomeric region with fitc, respectively. hybridization of the chromosome  <dig> mband probe to metaphase spreads  was performed to examine copy number and structural stability of chromosome  <dig> in both cell types. twenty metaphases in three independent fish experiments were analyzed per cell type. we observed no structural or numerical aberrations in chromosome  <dig> in the cells studied. figure 1b represents an example of a preb lymphocyte metaphase, with both copies of chromosome  <dig> labeled by the mband probe. figure 1c depicts the mband profiles of the two chromosomes from a preb lymphocyte metaphase. all four fluorochromes can be clearly identified.

mbanding of chromosome  <dig> in interphase nuclei
we performed fish on 3d preserved cell preparations from the two b cell types. with exception for the distal interstitial probe labeled with deac, all mband probes consistently showed the identification of specific fish signals that were clearly distinguishable from non-specific background. we therefore excluded the deac labeled mband probe from all further measurements. image z-stacks from  <dig> nuclei of preb and  <dig> nuclei of n wild-type mouse lymphocytes were captured and deconvolved . figure 1d shows a representative chromosome  <dig> mbanding image of a n wild-type b lymphocyte 3d nucleus. 3d reconstructed images and movies representing various orientation patterns can be viewed in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

orientation of chromosome  <dig> in the 3d nucleus as examined by visual inspection
using mbanding, we were able to analyze the chromosome orientation of mouse chromosome  <dig> subregions for the first time in 3d interphase nuclei. we determined the frequency of nuclear chromosome orientation patterns by visual inspection in all captured nuclei from preb lymphocytes and n wild-type mice. mband territories were designated as parallel  to the nuclear surface when no chromosome end was pointing towards the nuclear center or the periphery. a homolog of chromosome  <dig> was classified as “c” when the centromeric region was localized closest to the nuclear border and “t when its telomeric end showed the most peripheral positioning. figure  <dig> provides a cartoon illustration for the various orientation patterns observed. the most frequent pattern observed was with both copies of chromosome  <dig> located in parallel with the nuclear border   . there was no significant difference in the occurrence of this orientation pattern between both lymphocyte types against all other patterns combined . the second most common orientation observed was with one homolog of chromosome  <dig> orientated with its telomeric end pointing towards the nuclear center, while the other chromosome  <dig> was parallel with the nuclear border  . there was no significant difference in the frequency of this orientation pattern seen between both types of lymphocytes  . one chromosome  <dig> pointing with its centromeric end to the center and the other in parallel with the nuclear border  was the third most common orientation we observed. the occurrence of this orientation pattern did not differ significantly in both types of lymphocytes  with a frequency of  <dig> % of the preb nuclei and of  <dig> % of the n wild-type lymphocyte nuclei . in  <dig> % of preb and  <dig> % of n wild-type lymphocyte nuclei, both copies of chromosome  <dig> were orientated with their centromeric ends to the nuclear center  . furthermore, in  <dig> % in preb and  <dig> % n wild-type lymphocyte nuclei one chromosome  <dig> pointed towards the nuclear center with its telomeric end and the other points towards the center with its centromeric end  . the scenario that both chromosomes  <dig> were orientated with their telomeric ends to the nuclear center  was observed in  <dig> % of the preb and  <dig> % of the n wild-type mouse lymphocyte nuclei .

orientation patterns of chromosome  <dig> and the frequency of orientation in pre b lymphocytes of balb/c origin and in b cells of congenic n wild-type mice analyzed by visual inspection. a 2x <dig> chi-square test with p-value of > <dig>  indicates that the frequency of the orientation is not significantly different between the two cell types. each pattern was tested between the two cell types against all other patterns combined and the expected values were based on the marginal totals. there is a significant difference in the percentage of cells that display these major 2x <dig> orientation patterns between the two cell types . .

by visual inspection we observed three main patterns of chromosome  <dig> orientation in the 3d interphase nucleus:  both homologs of chromosome  <dig> in parallel to the nuclear border ;  one copy of chromosome  <dig> in parallel to the border and the other copy pointing with its telomeric end towards the nuclear center ;  one copy of chromosome  <dig> in parallel to the border and the other copy pointing with its centromeric end towards the center . table  <dig> shows the frequencies of the different orientation patterns in the two cell types and 2x <dig> chi square p-values demonstrating the significant difference of each pattern with respect to all other orientation patterns combined. there was no significant difference in the occurrence of the orientation patterns observed between both b cell types , with the exception of two minor patterns of orientation: when both copies of chromosome  <dig> pointed with their centromeric   or telomeric   ends towards the nuclear center .

a 2x <dig> contingency analysis of just the three major orientation patterns indicated that there was a significant difference in the distribution of the three patterns between the two cell type .

semi-automated quantitative analysis of mband  <dig> orientation in mouse lymphocytes
to validate the above results, we analyzed nuclear orientation patterns of individual chromosomes  <dig> for a subset of  <dig> nuclei per cell type with the semi-automated software package eads  <cit> . the mean radial arrangement of telomeric, interstitial and centromeric mband regions was determined in these  <dig> nuclei from both b cell types. we measured the 3d fish signal distance to the nuclear surface in nm using eads software  <cit> , and then transformed these values to relative values  by normalizing it to the nuclear radius. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and additional file 16: table s <dig> show the results of the semi-automated software assisted analysis: the data indicate that this semi-quantitative analysis identifies, similar to the visual inspection, three most frequent orientation patterns for mouse chromosome  <dig> 

when comparing the individual results of the quantitative analysis to the analysis by visual inspection of all  <dig> image per cell type we found, however, that only 30/ <dig>  nuclei of n wild-type mouse lymphocyte and 28/ <dig>  nuclei of pre b lymphocytes showed concordant results with both methods.

3d conformation of mouse chromosome 11
we evaluated the 3d conformation of chromosome  <dig> in the two lymphocyte cell types using the software eads  <cit> . we measured the angles between the geometric centers of centromeric, interstitial and telomeric mband territories using the interstitial segment as apex. analysis of each  <dig> preb and n wild-type chromosomes using distangle software allowed us to determine whether the chromosome territory is preferentially straight or angulated during interphase. mean measured angles in preb cells  were very similar compared to n wildtype b cells  and showed no statistically significant differences . in both cell types we observed a broad distribution of measured angles . 19% of preb and 15% of n wild-type b cell ct <dig> showed angles between  <dig> and 60° and were considered as rather angulated. 47% of preb and 43% of n wild-type b cell ct <dig> showed angles between 121° and 180° and indicate a trend towards a straight configuration .

we also calculated the angle difference between homologous ct <dig> in individual nuclei. again, we observed a broad distribution of measured angle differences in both b cell types ranging from 4°-136° . mean angle differences between homologs in preb cells  were slightly larger compared to n wild-type b cells , but no statistically significant differences were observed .

cell cycle profiles
to investigate whether cell cycle stages impact on the nuclear orientation and orientation patterns of mouse chromosome  <dig>  we carried out fluorescent activated cell sorter  analysis of cell cycle profiles. the dna profile of the preb lymphocytes of balb/c origin is shown in figure 4a and the dna profile of the n wild-type mouse b cells is shown in figure 4b. as the preb lymphocytes were kept proliferating in culture, the cells are distributed throughout the different cell cycle phases with  <dig> % in g0/g <dig>   <dig> % in s and  <dig> % in g2/m . contrastingly, the vast majority of the primary b cells are found in g0/g <dig>  with only  <dig> % in s and  <dig> % in g2/m . the comparison of the distinct cell cycle profiles observed for the n wild-type mouse b cells and preb cells indicates that the chromosome  <dig> orientation is independent of cell cycle profiles in the two b cell types examined in our study.

discussion
we used mbanding for the first time to study chromosome orientation in the mouse 3d b cell nucleus. this technique has mostly been used previously to detect intrachromosomal rearrangements such as inversions, translocations and deletions in metaphase spreads  <cit> . one previous study used mbanding to examine the spatial arrangements and the 3d configuration of ct in human sperm nuclei, demonstrating that mbanding is an excellent technique to determine the 3d nuclear orientation of chromosomes  <cit> . two alternative approaches were recently described, which could also be applied for a 3d topology analysis of mouse chromosomes, or could even be combined with the mouse mband probe set to further enhance the subregional resolution of the fish banding probe set. one first approach used evolutionary rearranged chromosomes as subchromosomal probes for 3d-fish  <cit> , the second pooled bac probes for predefined genomic regions or interest  <cit> .

using a mouse mband  <dig> probe set, we first determined chromosome  <dig> orientation by visual inspection. we then conducted a semi-automated quantitative analysis using the software eads  <cit> . both methods agreed on the identification and frequency of three different orientation patterns but did not coincide for each nucleus measured.

this result points to differences in the interpretation of mband data by the user  and by the user performing semi-automated analysis that includes the manual segmentation of the regions of interest. during this procedure, some pixels might have been discarded or identified as artifacts when cutting out the bands separately in different channels with no overview of the whole chromosome. it was not possible to distinguish low grey levels from each other or background pixels with value  <dig>  which may lead to mistakes in the manual segmentation. the pixels of the bands were measured with respect to the nucleus stained in dapi. if dapi staining was weaker in some cells than in others, then the subsequent identification of the positions of the band pixels are measured inaccurately. due to the lack of a fully automated program, these current measurements are only indicative of varied chromosome orientation patterns in the cells examined, but no absolute measure of chromosome band positioning. we are currently working towards a fully automated program.the preb cells were kept proliferating in culture, while the majority  of the primary b cells were directly isolated from the mice  conditions) and are in g0/g <dig> of the cell cycle; this was confirmed through facs cell cycle analysis . in cycling preb cells no correlation was found between cell cycle stage and radial orientation of mband ct. we have not determined the cell cycle stage of the individual nuclei, e.g. by brdu, so we can only state “no difference between cycling and quiescent cells” the influences of differentiation and gene density on the nuclear architecture and on the radial orientation of gene dense telomeric chromatin appear to be a more likely cause for the observed differences between the two cell types. gene density can be ruled out as cause for differences because it is the same in both cell types. this leaves differentiation as cause, which is linked to transcription.

transcription may influence chromosome position. regions of chromatin have been shown to change position in the nucleus with activation and increased levels of transcription  <cit> . transcription factories can also alter the arrangement of chromatin as genes may loop out of their territory to be transcribed  <cit>  or multiple genes will meet to be co-transcribed in a single transcription factory  <cit> . the access to transcription factories , therefore, may be relevant for the orientation of chromosomes in the nucleus. a possible rotation of a chromosome in the nucleus may be an alternate way in which active regions can access the transcription machinery. for example, chromosome rotation could occur around the centromeric or telomeric end. this would allow genes that lay close to rotation axis to remain in a stable position whereas those further away will undergo a positional change. alternatively, or in addition to rotation, a chromosome territory may adopt different large-scale folding patterns in order to reach this goal, which may result in straight or angulated 3d conformations. additionally, the active state of chromatin with regards to methylation, acetylation and other post-translational histone modifications, may not only alter chromatin condensation but also orientation. to test for the effects of transcription on chromosome orientation was beyond the scope of this study.

in approximately 45% of the nuclei examined, it was observed that the two homologs of chromosome  <dig> did not have the same orientation. this may be an innate protection mechanism of the cell. it has been shown by heride et al.  <cit>  that chromosomes are non-randomly closer to a heterologue than a homologue. this led them to propose that it may be evolutionarily important to position chromosomes in this way to avoid homologous recombination and to avoid damaging both copies of a chromosome by a single genotoxic stress event. the same argument may explain why two copies of a chromosome may adopt different orientations in the nucleus.

in this study we examined, for the first time, chromosome orientation in the murine 3d nucleus using mbanding. we found that the orientation of chromosome  <dig> in preb lymphocytes of balb/c origin and primary b cells of congenic n wild-type mice varies between distinct patterns of orientation. gene density has been thought to be the primary factor influencing lymphocyte ct arrangement. we find, however, that it is not sufficient to determine the orientation of mouse chromosome  <dig> in b cells. because gene-density is stable, it cannot account for differences in the three major patterns of chromosome  <dig> orientation we observed. although we did not find orientation pattern and gene-density to be linked for chromosome  <dig> in both b-cell models, this may not hold true for all mouse chromosomes and cell types and should be assessed for other chromosomes and non b lineage cell types. at present, our findings allow us to conclude that chromosomes may display distinct orientations in the interphase nucleus of diploid mouse b cells during some stages of differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed for the first time the orientation of mouse chromosome  <dig> with respect to the telomeric and centromeric ends of chromosomes in the 3d interphase nucleus. distinct orientation patterns of ct  <dig> in preb lymphocytes of balb/c origin and primary b cells of congenic n wild-type mice were observed. the most frequent pattern was with both homologs positioned in parallel to the nuclear border in both types of b lymphocytes. alternatively the telomeric or centromeric end was found pointing towards the nuclear periphery or center. overall, chromosome orientation appears to be a non-random feature of the genome in interphase nuclei.
