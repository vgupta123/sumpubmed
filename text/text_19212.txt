BACKGROUND
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a group of gram negative, motile bacilli, first described in  <dig> by w.h. burkholder as the causative agent of soft rot in onion  <cit> . bcc species can be found throughout the environment, and have been isolated from sources such as soil, water, and plants  <cit> . bcc organisms are extremely diverse and versatile in their metabolic capabilities and although discovered as a plant pathogen, some strains of the bcc are actually beneficial to plants and to the environment. the bcc has also become known as an important group of opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients, specifically in those with cystic fibrosis  or chronic granulomatous disease   <cit> . since most clinically relevant strains of the bcc are resistant to multiple antibiotics, the most effective treatments against bcc bacteria involve specific antibiotic combinations. however, even with repeated combination antibiotic therapy in cf patients, clearance of the microorganisms is not observed. as an alternative treatment, bacteriophage  therapy is currently being researched and tested for the treatment of bcc infections  <cit> .

phage therapy, developed felix d'herelle, involves the use of lytic phages to kill infecting bacteria  <cit> . however, modified temperate phages or phage products may also be considered  <cit> . phage therapy may prove to be more effective and efficient than antibiotics, especially since it is much easier to modify a phage than it is to develop a new antibiotic when bacterial strains become resistant. however, there are still a number of problems with using phages as therapeutic agents that must be overcome, one of these problems being lysogenic conversion. in order for phage therapy to be used safely, especially when involving temperate phages, it is important to determine if phages encode bacterial toxins or genes that could be harmful if acquired by the host bacterium. a mu-like phage of the bcc, bcepmu, for example, encodes a putative exea homolog, which may be involved in the secretion of toxins, and a 3-o-acyltransferase homolog, which may be responsible for a bacterium's resistance towards certain antibiotics  <cit> . other well-known examples of phages conferring virulence to their bacterial hosts are the cholera toxin of vibrio cholera, the shiga toxin of e. coli, and the scarlet fever toxin of streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> . therefore, phages should be sequenced to ensure that they do not harbor potential virulence determinants before they are used in a therapeutic setting.

in  <dig>  seed and dennis isolated four lytic phages from onion rhizosphere as well as five temperate phages from five different strains within the bcc  <cit> . one of these temperate phages, ks <dig>  was isolated as prophage of b. cenocepacia strain k56- <dig>  most b. cenocepacia of et <dig> lineage similar to k56- <dig>  such as strain j <dig>  harbour a mu-like prophage called bcepmu, while k56- <dig> does not  <cit> . a search of the previously determined b. cenocepacia j <dig> genomic sequence, as well as a more extensive search for lysogeny in bcc strains, determined bcepmu to be the only known prophage of j <dig>  <cit> . this study reports the host range, genome sequence and organization, and putative gene functions of the transposable phage ks <dig> in comparison to bcepmu and mu. analysis of the ks <dig> genome will allow us to identify any potential virulence determinants encoded by this temperate bcc phage.

RESULTS
properties of lysogenic phage ks10
ks <dig> was originally identified as pinpoint plaques present on lawns of uninduced cultures of b. cenocepacia k56- <dig>  in contrast to phage mu, and many other mu-like phages, ks <dig> in k56- <dig> appears to spontaneously switch to its lytic life cycle at a high frequency. because of this, it was not necessary to use mitomycin c or exposure to uv light to initiate induction. the phage lysate from b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> plated on another bcc strain well-known to be susceptible to phage infection  <cit> , b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  produces slightly larger plaques than the small pinpoint plaques found on k56- <dig>  to confirm that ks <dig> is a prophage of k56- <dig>  ks <dig> was propagated on lmg  <dig> and did not form plaques on k56- <dig>  indicating resistance to superinfection. ks <dig> particles are structurally stable over a long period of time, with titers remaining as high as  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml after storage in suspension media  for  <dig> months. because of this trait, just one plaque of ks <dig> in  <dig> ml of sm can produce confluent lysis when plated with strain lmg  <dig> 

an electron micrograph  of ks <dig> virions negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid shows an icosahedral head and tail that appears to be contractile upon visualization . this is typical of the myoviridae family of phages. em analysis also reveals the average ks <dig> head size to be approximately  <dig> nm with a tail length of approximately  <dig> nm.

determination of the genome sequence
the ks <dig> dna sequence was determined using a shotgun cloning and sequencing approach. phage dna was digested with restriction enzymes, ligated into puc <dig> or pgem7z, and transformed into chemically competent dh5α cells. inserts larger than  <dig> kb were also subcloned and sequenced. all inserts were sequenced at least twice, and pcr or primer walking was used to fill gaps in the sequence. initial restriction digests suggested an estimated genome size of  <dig> kb. approximately  <dig> runs with an average read-length of  <dig> bp were assembled to give greater then 4-fold genome coverage, resulting in a single contig totaling  <dig>  bp in length. this dna sequence had approximately 63% gc content, which is significantly higher than that of phage mu, but similar to bcepmu. in order to determine if the recently completed b. cenocepacia j <dig> genome was lysogenized by ks <dig>  a blastx analysis was carried out at the wellcome trust sanger institute site , revealing that ks <dig> is indeed a prophage of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  a comparison of the ks <dig> sequence with the j <dig> genomic sequence showed an exact ks <dig> sequence is located in chromosome  <dig> of j <dig> , on the complementary strand. as b. cenocepacia j <dig> also harbours prophage bcepmu, this strain contains two functionally similar mu-like phages, whereas b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> only contains the mu-like phage ks <dig> 

the right end phage insertion site, which varies across and within b. cenocepacia strains, was determined by sequencing two clones and one subclone from b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> that contained the phage/host dna junction at two different insertion sites. these results indicated that there was random insertion occurring within the b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> genome, a feature characteristic of transposable phages. the left end phage insertion site was obtained using pcr of genomic dna since no shotgun clones containing a phage/host insert were originally isolated. forward primers were designed to the chromosome for the region upstream of the gene interrupted by the ks <dig> phage as determined for the right end insertion site, and reverse primers were designed to the left end of completed ks <dig> phage sequence.

host range and presence of ks <dig> within the bcc
using a plaque assay,  <dig> bcc strains were tested for their sensitivity to ks <dig>  only three of the tested strains were found to support plaque formation with ks10: b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  b. cenocepacia pc <dig>  and b. stabilis lmg  <dig>  lysates obtained from filter sterilized uninduced overnight cultures of both k56- <dig> and j <dig> were able to form plaques on lmg  <dig>  pc <dig>  and lmg  <dig>  since b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  is also a host for bcepmu, lysate obtained from an overnight culture of b. cenocepacia j <dig> will also form bcepmu plaques on a lawn of b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  on these plates we observed a noticeable increase in the number of plaques, suggesting that both ks <dig> and bcepmu were being shed by j <dig>  it is possible that ks <dig> was not detected in previous attempts to isolate prophages from strain j <dig> by assaying an overnight culture for pfu  <cit>  due to its relatively poor host range, and its overlap in host range with bcepmu. interestingly, although the lysogenic phase phage repressors of ks <dig> and bcepmu show 36% identity to each other, and both prophages are found integrated into b. cenocepacia strains such as j <dig>  in b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> only ks <dig> can exist as a prophage while bcepmu will form plaques on this strain.

in host k56- <dig>  at the time of initial ks <dig> sequencing, the majority of the cloned host/phage sequences show that ks <dig> was inserted before amino acid  <dig> of a transcriptional regulator in the gntr family . since ks <dig> is a transposable phage, after transposition it can be inserted in many different locations within the genome. blastn analysis of the host dna flanking the phage sequence from the sanger site indicates that in b. cenocepacia j <dig> the prophage is located in chromosome  <dig>  and has inserted in an oxidoreductase gene in the gfo/idh/moca family around amino acid  <dig>  it has been suggested that prophages are arranged so that their structural genes are oriented in the same direction as the genes surrounding them, but the orientation of the ks <dig> prophage in j <dig> orients the transcription of structural genes from right to left, while the surrounding genes are transcribed from left to right   <cit> .

* – also known to contain bcepmu

nd – not determined

to determine the distribution of ks <dig> within the genome of other bcc species/strains, pcr using primers specific to the ks <dig> sequence was used. b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> and j <dig> chromosomes were used as positive controls since these strains are known to be lysogenized by ks <dig>  b. ambifaria lmg  <dig> genomic dna was used as a negative control due to the ability of ks <dig> to form plaques on this strain. seven strains of b. cenocepacia and one strain from each of the other species in the bcc experimental strain panel were tested  <cit> . only one other bcc strain was found to be lysogenized with ks <dig>  b. cenocepacia strain c <dig>  and this strain has been shown previously to contain an integrated bcepmu  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> bcc clinical isolates obtained from the university of alberta hospitals  cystic fibrosis clinic were also tested, revealing that ks <dig> is a prophage in seven of these isolates. all seven isolates were characterized as b. cenocepacia based on fur gene sequence analysis, suggesting that ks <dig> is a temperate phage specific to b. cenocepacia of the bcc   <cit> .

integration of ks10
we attempted to identify the exact location of ks <dig> in all known bcc hosts by locating the actual phage integration site. arbitrary primers  and a specific ks <dig> primer, in addition to the apa gene gold genome walker kit , were used in pcr experiments to determine the precise insertion site of the integrated prophage. unfortunately, pcr products obtained were found by sequence analysis to be the result of mispriming. this finding limited our ability to identify an exact site of insertion for ks <dig> in each b. cenocepacia genome, even though pcr tests unambiguously identified its presence in the genomes of these strains .

****function predicted using phyre database

normally, ks <dig> will form plaques on lawns of b. ambifaria lmg  <dig> and b. cenocepacia pc <dig>  but at a lower frequency ks <dig> will also enter into its lysogenic life cycle. to demonstrate that ks <dig> can insert into the chromosomes of these hosts, colonies of strains that had been lysogenized with ks <dig> were selected. in order to obtain these lysogens, ks <dig> was plated with lmg  <dig> and pc <dig> and turbid plaques indicative of lysogeny were selected using a needle tip. two lmg  <dig> lysogens and one pc <dig> lysogen were collected and demonstrated by pcr to harbour ks <dig> 

ks <dig> potential genes and homologues
genemark and ncbi's orf finder programs were used to identify open reading frames within the ks <dig> genome sequence  <cit> . each identified orf was characterized using blast analysis against deposited sequences in the ncbi databases in order to assign a possible function . regions upstream of the orfs were examined to determine potential ribosome binding sites  between  <dig> and  <dig> bases upstream of the start codon  <cit> . a total of forty-nine putative genes were identified, with just less than half encoding hypothetical proteins possessing no known function. ks <dig> genes  <dig> and  <dig> have significantly lower gc content than the genome overall  suggesting that these genes were acquired by ks <dig> more recently. all putative genes utilize aug as their translational start codon, except for two possessing a uug and gug start codon.

blast analysis  showed that approximately 18% of ks <dig> proteins are homologous to proteins of bcepmu, whereas another 18% show homology to mu proteins  <cit> . 14% of ks <dig> proteins show identity to proteins from ralstonia solanacearum strain uw <dig>  although they are not annotated as such in the uw <dig> genbank entry, these are likely proteins of a prophage and not bacterial proteins. the highest percent identity that ks <dig> protein sequences exhibit to an orthologous protein is 67%, while the majority of ks <dig> proteins show only moderate identity and similarity to other phage proteins . because dna recombination can often occur between prophages in the same bacterial genome, it is perhaps surprising that none of the ks <dig> genes show higher homology to bcepmu genes, since ks <dig> was found to be a prophage in several b. cenocepacia strains that are also lysogenized with bcepmu.

the genes identified as encoding hypothetical proteins using the standard blastx searches were subjected to analysis with psi-blast. this program uses the predicted amino acid sequences of each gene to detect putative conserved domains within the sequence  <cit> . using this program, ks <dig> gp <dig> and gp <dig> were identified as being the large and small terminase subunits, which are predicted to be atp-binding proteins involved in dna packaging into the procapsid  <cit> . these putative terminase genes are physically located after the virion morphogenesis and portal genes, an order that is conserved in many phage genomes  <cit> . similarly, gp <dig> was found to show homology to flumu <dig> using psi-blast, a protein that is thought to be analogous to lambda g, a tail assembly chaperone  <cit> .

higher order bioinformatic analysis was performed using in-house programs for protein domain identification and functional prediction  <cit> . these analyses confirmed the results obtained using blast analyses but provided little additional functional protein information . potential virulence factor genes were not identified within the genome of ks <dig>  however, there remain several genes encoding hypothetical proteins within the ks <dig> genome that cannot be excluded as potential virulence factors until their functions are determined.

head assembly genes
in most phages, head assembly involves five major stages, each involving a number of phage encoded proteins. the first stage, initiation, involves the initiation of polymerization of phage coat proteins by minor head proteins. next, during shell formation, the immature procapsid, comprised of coat proteins, is assembled around the scaffold protein, which is subsequently cleaved to form a mature procapsid. following the maturation of the procapsid are the two final stages, dna packaging and head completion  <cit> . in ks <dig>  gp1-gp <dig> and gp28-gp <dig> are expected to be involved in head assembly based on homology. ks <dig> gp <dig> and gp <dig> are identified as the protease and scaffolding proteins, which are structurally important to this process. the scaffolding protein has been shown to be essential in assembling coat proteins, encoded by gene  <dig> in ks <dig>  into the capsid shell  <cit> . once this shell is formed, it is thought that the protease, encoded by ks <dig> gene  <dig>  is involved in removing this scaffold. as is the case in many other phages, the scaffold gene of ks <dig> is embedded in frame with the protease gene.

the proteins involved in the actual packaging of the dna into the procapsid are the terminases, portal, and major capsid, which in ks <dig> are identified as gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and gp <dig> respectively. ks <dig> gene  <dig> encodes a protein that shows homology to mug, which is thought to be a tail protein, though its function is unclear  <cit> . this gene also shows no similarity to other known genes in other non-mu-like phages  <cit> . ks <dig> gene  <dig> encodes a protein putatively involved in virion morphogenesis since it exhibits identity to muf, though its function remains unknown. there are also a number of genes encoding hypothetical proteins interspersed within these genes, which could encode minor proteins involved in forming the mature capsid.

host cell lysis
phage host cell lysis usually involves a number of proteins, including a holin and a lysin. in ks <dig>  these proteins are encoded by gene  <dig> and gene  <dig>  respectively. there are a variety of lysins that can be phage encoded, all of which are peptidoglycan hydrolases. holin proteins are hydrophobic and associate with the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacteria, creating holes that allow the lysin to move into the periplasm. ks <dig> holin and lysin proteins show homology to the holin and lysin of bcepmu, but the lysins differ in the n-terminal region  <cit> . psi-blast analysis revealed the lysin of ks <dig> to have a soluble lytic transglycosylase  domain of  <dig> amino acids, similar to that of bcepmu and other non-mu phages such as t <dig>  most enzymes of this nature found in e. coli have been shown to catalyze the cleavage between n-acetylmuramic acid and n-acetylglucosamine, resulting in  <dig> -anhydromuramic acid. in e. coli, these enzymes degrade the cell wall murein during bacterial morphogenesis  <cit> . in bcepmu this slt domain is conserved over residues 46– <dig>  while in ks <dig> the domain is conserved over residues 70– <dig>  most phage lysins lack their own signal peptide  sequence, and are under control of the holin for release. in a search for encoded sp sequences within the lysin gene of ks <dig>  however, a potential sp sequence was identified using signalp server . the cleavage site in ks <dig> gp <dig> was predicted to be between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  the n-terminal region of ks <dig> putative lysin protein is also fairly hydrophobic, further suggesting that this protein contains an sp, although this activity has not been confirmed experimentally. although not a common phenomenon, lysins of other phages, such as the oenococcus oeni phage fog <dig>  have been found to contain an sp sequence. in this phage, overexpresssion of the lysin  in e. coli was lethal, which is uncommon for phage lytic enzymes. when the sp was deleted, overexpression of lys <dig> was no longer toxic  <cit> . other phage genes that encode secondary lysis proteins such as rz/rz <dig> were not identified in ks <dig> 

transposition
the proteins involved in transposition of ks <dig>  specifically those encoded by gene  <dig> and gene  <dig>  show the most homology to a transposase and transposition protein found in the genome of r. solanacearum strain uw <dig>  the ks <dig> transposase shows little homology to bcepmu and other mu-like transposases that are closely related to the s. auereus transposon tn <dig>  <cit> . the integrated ks <dig> lacks the 5'-tg...ca-3' dinucleotides at its termini, which are characteristic of mu-like prophage elements related to bcepmu carrying an rve integrase catalytic core domain  <cit> . however, the ks <dig> transposase does exhibit 30% identity and 44% similarity with the transposase from the transposable pseudomonas phage d <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, where the ks <dig> prophage is integrated, no evidence of direct repeats has been identified in the flanking bcc dna. the putative transposase binding sites for ks <dig> are imperfect direct repeats of  <dig> nucleotides. they do not appear to be similar to those found in bcepmu or e. coli mu, which correlates well with the transposase of ks <dig> not showing significant homology to transposase of mu or bcepmu. however, the putative ks <dig> transposase binding sites do contain the characteristic repeated a nucleotides within its target sequence . unlike the prophages mu, flumu, pnm <dig>  and sp <dig>  which have  <dig> putative transposase binding sites within their genomes, there are only  <dig> identified in ks <dig>  <cit> . these putative sites in ks <dig> were identified after a search for the consensus tnpa binding sites in both mu and bcepmu were not identified in the ks <dig> sequence .

gyrase binding sites have been identified in mu and some other mu-like phages, and are thought to promote the replicative transposition process that occurs during mu lytic growth. in mu and flumu this binding site is located between mu gpg and mu gpi  <cit> . a search for this site in ks <dig> revealed no similar sequence, though we predict that this binding site is present, as a previous study by sokolsky and baker revealed that gyrase is necessary in mu replicative transposition  <cit> . by using a drug that inhibits gyrase, they concluded that gyrase activity is important for the lytic life cycle of phage mu.

tail assembly
unlike proteins involved in head assembly, lysis, and transposition, there is little known about the proteins involved in mu tail assembly. the last approximately  <dig> kb of the ks <dig> genome is involved in tail assembly. like other members of the myoviridae family, mu-like phages have contractile tails, made up of a contractile sheath outside of an inner tail tube. the phage baseplate is located at the end of the tail and is attached to the tail fibers, which are involved in attachment to the host cell. ks <dig> genes  <dig> and  <dig> encode the tail sheath and tail tape measure proteins, respectively. in both mu and bcepmu, the tail tube gene is found between the genes encoding the tail sheath and the tape measure. in ks <dig> there is a hypothetical protein of  <dig> amino acids that, using a blast analysis, shows no homology or conserved domains to any protein in the database. this gene is the correct length and in the expected location to encode a tail tube protein based on other similar phages, but there is no experimental evidence to support this claim.

xu et al. suggest that there is a - <dig>  frameshift conserved amongst dsdna tailed phages that occurs before the tail tape measure gene and after the major tail gene  <cit> . this frameshift occurs in many phages including mu, flumu, p <dig>  lambda, and d <dig>  we found no evidence of a frameshift region before the tape measure gene in ks <dig>  using psi-blast analysis, a flum-like gp <dig> conserved domain was detected, which has been annotated as a lambda g analogue. in many dsdna tailed phages there is a "slippery" sequence within this gene that causes a frameshift creating two overlapping orfs. this sequence is usually a region of repeated a, t, or g nucleotides. in ks <dig>  a sequence capable of causing this frameshift was not identified using both a manual search as well as the frame shift finder program .

ks <dig> gp <dig> to gp <dig> are predicted to be involved in baseplate assembly since they show homology to mu proteins with this function. how each protein is involved in baseplate assembly in mu is yet unknown. ks <dig> gene  <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein showing 42% identity to a tail collar protein of a b. multivorans strain prophage and 27% identity to a tail fiber protein of a prophage in b. thailandensis strain e <dig>  in many mu-like phages, the gene or genes encoding tail fibers is/are relatively long. bcepmu, for example, has a tail fiber gene encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein, similar to the phage p <dig>  which is much larger than the small gene in ks <dig> showing low identity to a tail fiber. ks <dig> gp <dig>  a  <dig> amino acid protein at the end of the genome shows 46% similarity to the periplasmic component of an abc-type phosphate transporter system of pseudomonas stutzeri a <dig>  however, the region showing homology to the gene from p. stutzeri shows no conserved domains when analyzed using psi-blast and no homology to any other periplasmic component from an abc- type phosphate transporter system, suggesting that this is probably not the function of this protein. using the gtop sequence homology search  to compare ks <dig> gp <dig> to all viruses in the database, the amino acid sequence of ks <dig> gp <dig> showed homology to other phage proteins annotated as being involved in host specificity and putative tail-host specificity. though this homology was relatively low , it suggests that this  <dig> amino acid protein is a tail fiber protein involved in recognizing the phage receptor on the host cell, and not part of an abc-type phosphate transport system.

organization of the ks <dig> genome
unlike other sequenced phages similar to mu, the first  <dig> gene products of ks <dig> are involved in head assembly. following these genes in the ks <dig> genome are a number of genes involved in host cell lysis, followed by genes involved in transposition/integration, followed by additional genes involved in head assembly, and finally genes involved in tail formation. mu-like phages, as is the case with most related phages, are usually genetic mosaics of each other and are often arranged in modules so that genes encoding proteins that interact, such as capsid genes, will not be separated by nonhomologous events  <cit> . the ks <dig> genome, however, has genes responsible for capsid formation separated, with virion morphogenesis, portal, and terminase genes at the beginning of the genome . this is uncommon for a mu-like phage, as mu phages generally have genes for head assembly in the middle of the genome, in the late gene region, which is usually more highly conserved than the early and middle gene regions  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this organization  is unique to ks <dig>  the other genes involved in head assembly, such as the protease, scaffold, and a mug homologue, are located in the middle of the genome as expected.

when the ks <dig> genome is compared with the genome of mu, the first approximately  <dig> kb of ks <dig> genome is the most varied, and appears to be inverted , with genes responsible for host cell lysis located between integration and head assembly genes. the organization and direction of transcription in ks <dig> allows the genes responsible for integration and transcription regulation to interrupt the head assembly module. it is unknown why this phage, found in multiple b. cenocepacia genomes, would have its genome arranged this way. previous theories of phage evolution imply that evolution by illegitimate recombination usually occurs by recombination events that will not interrupt the individual modules, as is seen in the ks <dig> genome  <cit> . since the protease and scaffold genes are found in the middle of the genome, it is unlikely that the head assembly proteins encoded earlier would be used until these genes have been transcribed and translated. the module encoding proteins for tail assembly is located at the right end of the genome, similar to mu, though it lacks the invertible g region of mu. this invertible region found in mu and some related phages, encodes the proteins involved in tail fiber synthesis, and the orientation of the region determines the host range of the phage  <cit> . bcepmu, a similar phage found in b. cenocepacia, has a right end similar to p <dig> and also lacks this invertible g region  <cit> . although ks <dig> tail protein gene sequences do show homology to mu tail protein gene sequences, ks <dig> also lacks this invertible g region.

often phages contain genes that they have acquired through nonhomologous recombination with a host or another phage. these acquired genes may encode proteins that can be involved in lysogenic conversion of the host cell, causing the bacterial host to become more virulent  <cit> . in order to test the hypothesis that ks <dig> contains genes whose products may increase the virulence of the bacterial host, we compared the killing effect of b. ambifaria lmg  <dig> versus two strains of b. ambifaria  <dig> lysogenized with ks <dig> in the recently developed bcc galleria mellonella infection model  <cit> . we also tested wild type and ks <dig> lysogenized b. cenocepacia pc <dig> in this model. in all instances, the virulence of the bacterial strain harbouring the ks <dig> prophage was similar to that of the bacterial strains without the prophage, suggesting that ks <dig> does not carry virulence factor genes that are expressed in vivo .

a gene in ks <dig> that shows no homology to other known phage proteins is gene  <dig>  ks <dig> gp <dig> shows relatively high identity to a dksa/trar c4-type zinc finger protein found in bacteriophage l-413c. dksa is a dnak suppressor protein, which acts by suppressing transcription of dnak, while trar is a transcriptional activator. the coliphages p <dig>   <dig>  and phage phi mhaa1-phl <dig> also encode a protein showing homology to this dska/trar protein, though other phages similar to ks <dig> do not. in phi mhaa1-phl <dig> the conserved dsk/trar region is extends over the last  <dig> amino acids and it is hypothesized to be involved in transcriptional activation  <cit> . in ks <dig> gp <dig> the domain is conserved across the whole protein. this gene is located upstream of the first module of head genes. a possible role for this protein in ks <dig> could be to repress the transcription of genes 1– <dig> until the second head module is transcribed. if so, this protein may be responsible for controlling and coordinating the transcription of the two head gene modules.

while the ks <dig> genome seems to show unusual variability in its genomic organization, especially in the first half, it is possible that there are many other phages with similar organizations that have not yet been sequenced. phages are one of the most abundant particles on earth, but there are only a relatively small number of these phages whose genomes have been sequenced, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship of ks <dig> and its gene products to other phages. however, complete sequencing of bacterial genomes has provided increasing opportunities for prophage identification, and has also produced incontrovertible evidence of extensive phage-mediated exchange of genetic material between species. although previous publications have suggested that mu-like prophage elements are either rare or sufficiently divergent to be unrecognizable by sequence comparison, we have shown that polylysogeny does indeed occur in the bcc and that polylysogeny can occur with two different mu-like bcc phages  <cit> . further studies are required to understand the interactions of multiple active phages within a single genome of a strain of the bcc and their influence on cellular lifestyle and bacterial pathogenicity. the characterization of broad-host range bcc phages, regardless of whether they are lytic or lysogenic, will provide an opportunity to further develop these phages as novel therapeutic agents for use against infections caused by the highly antibiotic resistant bcc.

CONCLUSIONS
ks <dig> is a novel  <dig>  bp phage of the opportunistic bacterial pathogen burkholderia cenocepacia. genome sequence analysis and annotation of this phage reveals that ks <dig> shows the closest sequence homology to the transposable phages mu and bcepmu. ks <dig> differs from most phages in that its capsid genes are arranged into two modules, giving evidence of one or more prior genetic rearrangements. ks <dig> was found to be a prophage in three different strains of b. cenocepacia, including strains k56- <dig>  j <dig>  and c <dig>  and seven tested clinical isolates of b. cenocepacia, but no other bcc species. a survey of  <dig> strains and  <dig> clinical isolates of the bcc revealed that ks <dig> is able to form plaques on lawns of b. ambifaria lmg  <dig>  b. cenocepacia pc <dig>  and b. stabilis lmg  <dig>  there were no potential virulence factors identified in ks <dig>  though many hypothetical proteins were identified with no known function.
