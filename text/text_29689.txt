BACKGROUND
with continued consumption of fossil fuels, humankind faces a growing challenge of finding renewable sources of energy. although plant derived biomass contains appreciable energy, to serve as a fuel for transportation it must be chemically or biologically liquefied, a conversion that is the subject of strenuous efforts to make economical. success will presumably require not only advances in chemistry such as better catalysts, but also improved plants to serve as feedstock. as an ideal input, grasses are receiving considerable attention because certain species grow to great density, are perennial, and can require little if any fertilizer or irrigation  <cit> . but their very size, longevity, and genome complexity makes these species difficult subjects to study and breed.

for studying grasses, whether as sources for biofuel or for any other grass-specific question, an emerging model is brachypodium distachyon. this species is closely related to cereals and temperate grasses, and is about the same size as arabidopsis thaliana and has about the same generation time. studies on b. distachyon benefit from rapidly developing community resources, such as a completely sequenced genome, mutant collections , and efficient protocols for transformation and crossing  <cit> . of particular note for biofuels research, b. distachyon has cell walls that are similar compositionally to that of other grasses, like wheat , barley , and miscanthus <cit> . insofar as the cell wall constitutes almost the entirety of the input for converting biomass to biofuel, this similarity, along with the genetic attributes of this small grass, emphasize its suitability as a model for grass-related, biomass crop research.

within the cell wall, as a target for optimization, cellulose is pre-eminent. cellulose is the most abundant of any single wall component and is made exclusively of glucose, a tractable and energy rich molecule. cellulose comprises long polymers of  β-linked glucose that are synthesized at the plasma membrane and associate laterally into a microfibril. because of the configuration of the glucose residues, hydrogen bonds form at great density both within and between chains, a density that gives cellulose an elastic modulus rivaling that of steel but makes the structure impervious to degradation whether chemical or enzymatic.

within the plasma membrane, the structure synthesizing cellulose is called a “terminal complex”  <cit> . in land plants and related green algae, the terminal complex as seen in the electron microscope comprises six subunits with hexagonal symmetry and is called a “rosette”  <cit> . the primary constituents of the rosette are cellulose synthase a  proteins. these proteins belong to processive glycosyltransferase family  <dig> and are thought to be the catalytic subunits for polymerizing the glucose chain. in angiosperms, cesas usually comprise a small gene family with around ten members  <cit> .

identification of cesa proteins and characterization of their function has greatly benefited from the facile genetics of a. thaliana. from this work, it emerged that certain cesa proteins synthesize the primary cell wall whereas others synthesize the secondary cell wall  <cit> . furthermore, it appeared that a given cell must express three distinct cesa proteins to produce cellulose at optimal levels. for the secondary cell wall, a screen based on collapsed xylem cells led to the identification of several irregular xylem  lines, three of which, irx <dig>  irx <dig>  and irx <dig>  harbor lesions in atcesa <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . supporting the hypothesis of non-redundancy, these genes are expressed at similar levels in similar cell types, and the null mutants have indistinguishable phenotypes, including weak stems, collapsed xylem, and thin secondary cell walls that are deficient in cellulose.

identification of a trio of cesa genes primarily responsible for synthesizing cellulose in secondary cell walls has been supported by work in other systems, including grasses. first, atcesa <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are represented in some angiosperm species by a single sequence each, and orthologs are more closely related than homologs   <cit> . second, in grasses, a mutant of barley, fragile stem  <dig>  with brittle stems and low cellulose content in the mature plant was attributed to a lesion in the barley ortholog of atcesa <dig>  <cit> . in addition, “brittle culm” mutants in rice  have been mapped to the three orthologs of atcea <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and again these mutants have similar phenotypes, including modest dwarfism, thinner and weaker culms, and reduced cellulose content  <cit> . however, it is not understood why three distinct proteins are needed nor is it known which of the loss-of-function phenotypes result directly from the lost protein and which result as a consequence of cumulative effects.

here we describe the cesa gene family in b. distachyon with the aid of gene expression profiling and phylogeny. furthermore a detailed analysis of the candidate secondary cesas were performed by functionally characterizing mutants generated with specific artificial microrna constructs.

RESULTS
brachypodium distachyon cesa gene family
in b. distachyon, as in a. thaliana and rice, the cesa family comprises ten genes . their genomic sequences range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with  <dig> to  <dig> exons that form coding regions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . amino acid sequence comparisons revealed extensive similarity among the bdcesa proteins, with conserved structural features that are characteristic of cesa protein families  <cit> . all ten bdcesa proteins contain eight transmembrane domains and two hyper-variable regions. with the exception of bdcesa <dig>  they have the signature motif of glucosyl transferases, d,d,d,qxxrw, which is essential for binding udp-glucose. with the exception of bdcesa <dig> and  <dig>  the proteins contain the ring-type zinc finger domain with eight cystine residues spaced as characteristic for cesa proteins. even though bdcesa <dig> is categorized as a cesa, it is short, and lacks the ring-type zinc finger motif, a portion of the first hyper-variable region, and two of the conserved aspartate residues of the qxxrw motif. this is also true of oscesa <dig> and sorghum  sb10g <dig>  both of which are nonetheless considered part of the cesa family  <cit> .

based on the amino acid sequence, the ten bdcesa proteins fall into reasonably well-established phylogenetic groups . this is clearest for proteins associated with the secondary cell wall. brachypodium distachyon has three sequences that are highly similar to those characterized in other species as secondary cell wall cesas. we numbered these genes bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig>  and bdcesa <dig> based on their apparent orthologs in a. thaliana. note that the published numbering differs for rice. while the three secondary cesa clades have a single member in each species, there is no complete one-to-one relationship for the cesas associated with the primary cell wall. for example, b. distachyon has a single sequence in the cesa <dig> clade whereas a. thaliana has two. in contrast, b. distachyon has two sequences in the cesa <dig> clade whereas a. thaliana has only one. interestingly, both b. distachyon and a. thaliana have several members of the cesa <dig> clade but these duplications appear to have formed in each lineage after the divergence of the two species. based on sequence and conserved domains bdcesa <dig> seems to be the least similar to other cesa proteins. however a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the cellulose synthase a proteins and cellulose synthase like proteins of a. thaliana, rice and b. distachyon reveled the distinct similarity of bdcesa <dig> to other cesa proteins . where possible, we numbered the b. distachyon gene after its closest relative in a. thaliana.

in view of our interest in the secondary cell wall, we examined the b. distachyon secondary cell wall sequences at greater depth . in the cystine rich ring-type zinc finger domain, the sequences differ in the spacing between the second and third cystine. bdcesa <dig> has the canonical  <dig> amino acids whereas bdcesa <dig> has a single amino acid insertion and bdcesa <dig> has an eight amino acid deletion. such spacing variations have apparently not been previously reported for a. thaliana secondary cesas. however, the rice secondary cesa homologous to bdcesa <dig> exhibits the same eight amino acid deletion  <cit> . the ring-type zinc finger domain is the distinguishing feature of cesa proteins seen in the first portion of the n-terminus and is thought to be involved in cesa protein dimerization  <cit> .

brachypodium distachyon secondary cell wall cesa gene expression
to analyze cesa gene expression, we profiled transcripts with a whole genome tiling array focusing on organs expected to be enriched in secondary cell wall synthesis. to obtain rna, leaves and stems were harvested when the inflorescence emerged from the flag leaf, whereas roots were harvested from seven-day-old seedlings. additionally, to minimize changes in transcript abundance due to diurnal and circadian rhythms, rna was pooled from material harvested at six different circadian time points over a 24-hour period. in all three organs, bdcesa <dig> and  <dig> were expressed at essentially background levels and bdcesa <dig> was slightly greater . the four genes associated with the primary wall, bdcesa <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were expressed at high levels in both root and stem. on the other hand, those associated with the secondary wall were expressed at much lower levels in roots than stems, having a ratio of expression roughly consistent with secondary cell wall content across the three organ types .

localization of putative secondary cell wall cesa transcripts
to localize transcripts, we performed rna in situ hybridization on stems . stems were fixed, sectioned on a vibratome, and hybridized with labeled sense and anti-sense probes. upon color development, positive hybridization was detected mainly in the sections probed with the anti-sense probes. consistent with a role in secondary cell wall synthesis, hybridization for each probe was strong in the vascular bundles and the surrounding mechanical cells including the sclerenchyma fibers and the epidermis. hybridization was essentially undetectable in pith parenchyma, which undergoes limited cell wall thickening. these results strengthen the assignment of bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> as secondary cell wall related cesas.

artificial micrornas targeting bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa7
to examine the function of bdcesa <dig> and  <dig>  we sought to reduce transcript levels by means of artificial micrornas . the rice microrna, osamir <dig>  was modified to specifically target either bdcesa <dig> or bdcesa <dig> . each modified microrna is predicted to target only a single gene. the amir-cesa <dig> construct specifically targets nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  which are in the last exon immediately after the last transmembrane domain; in contrast, amir-cesa <dig> targets nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  which are in the last exon in between the seventh and the eighth transmembrane domains . to characterize the efficacy of these constructs, we measured mrna levels in the stem of t <dig> generation plants. for each construct, three to five individuals from families derived from three or four independent transformation events were analyzed by reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr . stems were harvested when the inflorescence was just emerging from the flag leaf, at developmentally equivalent time points. both of the artificial microrna constructs significantly reduced transcript abundance of the corresponding target . specifically, bdcesa <dig> was reduced  <dig>  fold and bdcesa <dig> was reduced  <dig>  fold. neither transgene detectably reduced the level of bdcesa <dig> and amir-cesa <dig> caused no significant decrease in bdcesa4; however, amir-cesa <dig> modestly decreased the expression of bdcesa <dig> .

bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> knock-down lines and the structure of the stem
the bdcesa knock-down lines were modestly but significantly decreased in stature and delayed in inflorescence emergence . to investigate anatomical changes, we examined first internode morphology of the same plants assayed for mrna levels. because the transgenic lines were grown at different times, each comparison included a wild-type control, and differences between these controls presumably reflect differences in growth conditions. hand-cut transverse stem sections were stained with the polychromatic basic dye, toluidine blue, and imaged using a light microscope. toluidine blue differentially stains cell wall polymers— polysaccharides purplish blue and lignified cell walls turquoise—allowing cell types to be distinguished. the artificial microrna constructs had little if any effect on the overall shape and arrangement of the vascular bundles . likewise, there was no significant difference between the genotypes in number of vascular bundles in either the inner or the outer ring . while changes in anatomy were minor or absent, stem diameter appeared to be reduced, consistent with the decreased plant height. measurements of stem area revealed a modest reduction, but one that was significant for both amir-cesa <dig> and amircesa <dig> .

to examine the effects of the artificial microrna constructs on cell wall structure, we measured cell wall thickness in the toluidine blue-stained sections. for both targets, the constructs reduced the thickness of cell walls modestly, but significantly . the reduction was similar for xylem as well as for interfascicular fibers. this observation is consistent with the phenotypes of secondary cesa mutants characterized in other grass species  <cit> .

knock-down of bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> and crystalline cellulose content
reduction in stem size along with the thinner cell walls indicated the possibility of a change in cell wall structure. completely senesced and homogenized stem tissue was analyzed. first, crystalline cellulose content was assayed by x-ray powder diffraction, using the same individuals analyzed for figures  <dig> and  <dig>  with the two wild-type samples pooled. the transgenic genotypes gave diffraction patterns with lower intensities at nearly all measured angles, although the effect in amir-cesa <dig> was stronger than in amir-cesa <dig> . to evaluate cellulose crystallinity, as described in methods, we calculated a crystallinity index by means of the so-called “amorphous subtraction method” . the crystallinity index confirmed the visual impression of the diffraction patterns, namely a significant reduction in cellulose crystallinity for amir-cesa <dig> 

second, we evaluated the amount of crystalline cellulose by sum-frequency-generation  vibration spectroscopy  <cit> . in this method, the sample is irradiated simultaneously by visible laser pulses at  <dig> nm and by infrared laser pulses with a tunable frequency. among reflected and scattered lights, there are photons whose frequency is the sum of two input laser frequencies, which can be filtered and recorded separately. due to the symmetry requirements, this frequency summation can be caused by crystalline cellulose but not by amorphous non-crystalline cell wall components  <cit> . for this analysis, lines were grown at the same time. in the spectra, there are three prominent peaks indicative of crystalline cellulose iβ: namely  <dig> cm- <dig> ascribed to symmetric ch <dig> stretching,  <dig> cm- <dig> ascribed to asymmetric ch <dig> stretching, and  <dig> cm- <dig> ascribed to the intra-chain hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl stretch   <cit> . taking avicel, a model cellulose iβ with a high crystallinity, as a standard, the intensity at  <dig> cm- <dig> can be used to estimate the crystalline cellulose amount by means of the previously determined calibration curve  <cit> . the comparison of the intensities recorded at  <dig> cm- <dig> indicated that the avicel-equivalent crystalline cellulose content tended to be reduced in amir-cesa <dig> and was significantly reduced in amir-cesa <dig> . these results are comparable to those from x-ray diffraction.

to examine cellulose crystallinity on a cellular scale, we used polarized-light microscopy on plants grown at one time and used also for the sum frequency generation spectroscopy. as described in methods, our microscope is based on circularly polarized light, allowing contrast to be independent of crystal orientation within the plane perpendicular to the microscope’s optical axis, and generating images in which intensity is proportional to birefringent retardance . as expected for the ubiquitous presence of cellulose, all cell walls of the wild-type had retardance, with epidermis, metaxylem, and cells of the vascular sheath being particularly strong . in contrast, cell walls in the stem of amir-cesa <dig> had weak retardance . although retardance would tend to decrease along with cell wall thickness, the decrease in retardance was much larger than that of cell wall thickness. likewise, compared to the wild-type, cell walls of amir-cesa <dig> had less retardance . however, for this genotype the decrease was modest and within the range that might be attributable to the thinner cell walls. these results, taken together with those from diffraction and spectroscopy, confirm that the reduced expression of bdcesa <dig> reduced the amount of crystalline cellulose present in the secondary cell wall.

discussion
for b. distachyon, this is apparently the first study detailing the cesa gene family and functionally characterizing bdcesas involved in secondary cell wall synthesis. members of the cesa family are best characterized in a. thaliana, where they are assigned a role for cellulose synthesis in either primary or secondary cell wall. other vascular plants have a similar gene family structure  <cit> . the b. distachyon cesa gene family includes the uncharacterized grass-specific cesa clade , which has been identified in all grass genomes sequenced to date, and all the other previously described clades  <cit> .

using amino acid sequences, the ten bdcesa genes were categorized into two groups: primary and secondary. each of the three secondary cesa clades contains a single a. thaliana protein and a single rice protein, which have all been functionally characterized  <cit> . fittingly, a single bdcesa protein was present in each of these clades, suggesting they have not expanded since the time of eudicot and monocot divergence 140– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this differs for the primary cesas, which have differentially expanded between eudicots and monocots. there are different numbers of proteins in the cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> clades in a. thaliana, b. distachyon, and rice, and the cesa <dig> clade has diverged into separate eudicot and monocot clades, referred to as cesa6a and cesa6b, respectively  <cit> . among the three secondary b. distachyon cesas, bdcesa <dig> was the most divergent, as was that clade member  in rice  <cit> . moreover, bdcesa <dig> and oscesa <dig> both lack eight amino acids in the first ring type zinc finger motif. however, a. thaliana cesa <dig> neither lacks those eight amino acids nor is notably divergent.

confirming the deduction from phylogeny, expression of the secondary bdcesas was generally enriched in stems, which are abundant in secondary cell walls, and transcripts were specifically abundant in stem vascular tissue and the surrounding mechanical tissue including sub-epidermal cell layers, tissues that all make secondary cell walls. this is consistent with the tissue-specific patterns of secondary cesa expression observed in rice, maize, a. thaliana, and barley  <cit> . interestingly, in developing stems of barley, hvcesa <dig> expression was two-fold greater than that of hvcesa <dig> <cit> , which was also observed here for bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig>  taken together, we conclude that bdcesa <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> encode cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for the secondary cell wall.

to our knowledge, this is the first report of artificial microrna-mediated gene silencing in b. distachyon. we characterized the loss-of-function lines generated for bdcesa <dig> or bdcesa <dig> for changes in morphology and cellulose crystallinity. while these lines had a small but significant delay in inflorescence emergence and a reduction in stature, whole plant morphology was similar to wild-type plants. similarly, delayed flowering and reduced stature was observed in the a. thaliana irx <dig> mutant and in rice brittle culm mutants  <cit> . sections of the stem revealed that the knock-down lines had a small but significant reduction in stem internode transverse cross-sectional area, a reduction that resembles that observed in rice brittle culm mutants and barley fragile stem  <dig> <cit> .

the loss-of-function lines for bdcesa <dig> and  <dig> had cell walls in xylem and sclerenchyma that were modestly but significantly thinner than wild-type. thinner cell walls are expected from a defect in secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis, and have been observed consistently in secondary cell wall cesa mutants  <cit> . in a. thaliana, the defining phenotype of secondary cesa mutants is irregular or collapsed xylem  <cit> . however, xylem contours appeared to be regular here, as they do in the secondary cesa mutants of rice  <cit> . these differences probably reflect distinctions between eudicots and monocots in xylem tension or cell wall composition rather than differences in protein function  <cit> .

cellulose is a linear glucan polymer made of β  linked glucose molecules. thirty-six such glucan chains are predicted to form a cellulose microfibril  <cit> . hydrogen bonding between microfibrils crystallizes multiple cellulose chains together providing the physical properties necessary to maintain rigid plant cell walls. crystallinity also allows cellulose to be readily quantified. we took advantage of spectroscopic techniques  and polarized-light microscopy to assess the status of cellulose in the loss-of-function lines.

for the amir-cesa <dig> mutants there was no significant decrease in crystallinity seen spectroscopically and the small decrease in birefringent retardance might reflect the thinner cell walls. given that bdcesa <dig> expression was reduced by less than a factor of two, a generally wild-type cellulose status is perhaps not unexpected. in contrast, the amir-cesa <dig> mutants had substantially decreased retardance and significantly decreased crystallinity from both diffraction and spectroscopic methods. the most parsimonious explanation for these data is that the cell walls of this line simply contained less cellulose than those of the wild-type. a nuanced explanation is that the cellulose synthesized in this line contained more defects, such as amorphous regions, or comprised microfibrils with fewer than the usual number  of glucose chains. these alternatives are difficult to distinguish. be that as it may, the significant decrease in crystalline cellulose amount or quality in this line matches the nearly 10-fold reduction in bdcesa <dig> expression. this result implies that the function of bdcesa <dig> is at least partially non-redundant and it is noteworthy that the expression of neither bdcesa <dig> nor  <dig> was elevated in an attempt at compensation.

CONCLUSIONS
interestingly, even though the two lines differed in the strength of the knock-down and in the consequent loss of cellulose, the morphological defects in the plants were similar and modest. this implies that small decreases in cesa activity are sufficient to impact the plant, possibly through a feedback system analogous to the one a. thaliana invoking theseus  <cit> , but that progressively larger changes to the plant need not follow from larger decreases in cesa activity. in this connection, it will be interesting to observe the phenotype of a complete loss of function mutant for bdcesa <dig>
