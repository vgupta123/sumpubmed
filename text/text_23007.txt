BACKGROUND
the octapeptide angiotensin ii  has diverse effects and regulates organismal blood pressure through many mechanisms, including effects on renal and intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport and changes in vascular smooth muscle tone. through these mechanisms, aii increases plasma volume and vasoconstriction, which contribute to its effect on blood pressure. in the kidney, in addition to stimulation of na+ reabsorption through increasing aldosterone release, aii also increases na+ transport at the proximal convoluted tubule through direct stimulation of apical sodium/hydrogen exchanger  activity  <cit> , in part mediated by direct action on proximal tubular aii receptors  <cit> . in the gi tract, aii increases activity and expression of colonic electrogenic na+ channels  <cit> , small intestinal electroneutral na+ absorption  <cit> , modulates colonic k+ transport  <cit> , and may also induce hco3- secretion  <cit> . however the precise mechanism underlying these effects remain incompletely understood. for some studies, the effects of aii on transport have been introduced vascularly  <cit>  and therefore the effects could be direct or indirect, such as aii-induced alterations of enteric nervous control of ion transport or alterations of regional blood flow. aldosterone is also thought to be involved in aii-induced sodium absorption in the gi tract, which targets the epithelial sodium channel  <cit> . however, aii binding sites have been demonstrated in membranes from intestinal epithelial cells  <cit>  and aii affects growth and proliferation of cultured small intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting direct intestinal effect of aii.

the present studies demonstrate that aii increases, in an aldosterone independent fashion, activity and expression of the apical sodium/hydrogen exchanger nhe <dig>  but not nhe <dig>  in cultured caco2bbe cells. because apical membrane nhes of the intestine are the major mediators of non-nutrient dependent absorption of na+  <cit> , these effects can potentially contribute to overall maintenance of metabolic balance and blood presssure. these effects are mediated by type i aii receptors through pathways that are dependent on phospholipase c, epoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid, phosphatidyl inositol  <dig> kinase and akt, and partially on metalloproteinase activity and stimulation of the egf receptor. these studies therefore provide compelling evidence of direct regulation of apical nhe <dig> in intestinal epithelial cells by aii.

RESULTS
angiotensin ii increases nhe <dig>  but not nhe <dig>  activity and membrane insertion acutely and in long term
caco2bbe cell monolayers were treated on the basolateral side with  <dig> nm angiotensin ii for times ranging from 1– <dig> hours. apical nhe activities were measured as 22na+ uptake sensitive to amiloride analogs hoe <dig>  or dma , as previously described  <cit> . nhe <dig> and nhe <dig> activities were defined as the hoe694-sensitive and -insensitive components of dma-inhibited 22na uptake, respectively. after two hours,  <dig> nm angiotensin ii significantly increased apical nhe <dig>  but not nhe <dig> activity . the increased nhe <dig> activity was paralleled by increased apical surface abundance of nhe <dig>  as assessed by apical surface biotinylation . in previous studies  <cit>  we had demonstrated that the conditions for apical surface biotinylation do not result in biotinylation of either basolateral surface proteins or intracellular proteins. equivalent protein amounts  were used for apical surface biotinylation and total nhe analyses . apical addition of  <dig> nm aii did not stimulate apical 22na+ transport at any time up to  <dig> hours . further increases in apical nhe <dig> activity were observed between 4– <dig> hours after aii stimulation, occurring in two 'phases'. from 1– <dig> hours, a smaller increase in apical nhe <dig> activity was observed with a progressive increase from  <dig> to  <dig> hours that was maintained for at least  <dig> hours. these changes were associated with increased apical surface nhe <dig> abundance. within one hour, however, little increase in total nhe <dig> protein expression was observed and from 2– <dig> hours, nhe <dig> protein expression increased . no changes were observed for apical surface or total nhe <dig> over this time . aii increased nhe <dig> expression and activity at  <dig> hours in a concentration-dependent fashion with effects beginning at low pm concentrations and maximal effects near  <dig> nm, concentrations that are in the physiologic range .

to determine if aii stimulates na+ transport in native intestine, segments of mouse jejunum were mounted in ussing chambers and transmural 22na+ fluxes measured. addition of aii  significantly increased the mucosal to serosal absorptive flux without change in the seriosal to mucosal flux, demonstrating that the aii-induced apical nhe <dig> activity observed in cultured caco2bbe cells is also observed in native intestine . the increase in m-to-s flux is small, however, it should be noted that the incubations time with aii was limited due to the limited viability of mouse jejunum in ussing chambers. aii was therefore added approximately  <dig> min after mounting tissues in the chambers and allowed to incubate with the mucosal strip for  <dig> min before initiating the  <dig> min flux period. had the experimental conditions allowed longer incubations, we suspect that the aii effect would have been greater.

aii stimulates transcription of the nhe <dig> gene
to determine whether aii increased nhe <dig> transcriptionally, mrna levels for nhe <dig> were measured by real time pcr. aii increased nhe <dig> mrna as early as  <dig> hours after treatment and this effect was maximal at  <dig> hours . to determine that the mrna increase was indeed due to increased transcription and not message stabilization, luciferase reporter assays with a  <dig> bp segment of the rat nhe <dig> gene promoter linked to firefly luciferase was used  <cit> . aii increased luciferase activity in a concentration dependent manner , demonstrating that aii promoted nhe <dig> gene transcription.

aii stimulation of nhe <dig> employs the type i receptor
to determine which type aii receptors were expressed by caco2bbe cells, mrna was isolated and primers specific to the type i and ii receptors were used for rt-pcr analyses. both types of receptors were expressed by these cells . to confirm that the pcr products were type i and ii human aii receptors, pcr bands were subcloned and sequenced. sequence of these pcr products was identical to the gene sequences, confirming expression of both receptor types. therefore, to determine whether the acute stimulation of nhe <dig> by aii used the type i or ii receptor, the receptor blockers losartan and pd <dig>  were used. inhibition of type i but not type ii receptors inhibited the aii stimulated apical na+ influx  as well as aii stimulated exocytosis of nhe <dig> .

to determine the mechanism of action, a panel of inhibitors were used for pathways known to be activated by aii or other g protein coupled receptors  <cit> . the following panel of inhibitors were tested: u <dig>  a phospholipase c inhibitor; ketoconazole, a cytochrome p <dig> inhibitor which blocks fatty acid epoxygenation; tapi- <dig>  a metalloproteinase inhibitor; tyrphostin ag- <dig>  an egf receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; pd <dig>  a mek- <dig> inhibitor; wortmannin and ly <dig>  phosphatidyl inositol  <dig> kinase inhibitors, and api- <dig>  an akt inhibitor. all of these agents except pd <dig> inhibited the aii stimulation of nhe <dig> activity after  <dig> hour , effects that were paralleled by their effects on aii stimulated apical surface nhe <dig> .

to determine if the long term changes in nhe <dig> expression were also mediated by type i receptor stimulation, cells were pretreated with losartan or pd <dig> and stimulated with aii for  <dig> hours and na+ fluxes measured. inhibition of the type i receptor blocked the aii-stimulated na+ flux increase while pd <dig> had no effect   <dig>  ±  <dig> , losartan + aii  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and pd <dig> + aii  <dig>  ±  <dig> ). therefore the long term effects of aii on caco2bbe nhe <dig> are also mediated by type i receptor stimulation.

discussion
the role of aii in regulation of blood pressure is well established, however, its actions are likely to occur through multiple mechanisms including effects on vascular smooth muscle and endothelium  <cit> . aii can also affect salt and water homeostasis through its actions on renal na reabsorption  <cit> . in addition, aii stimulates aldosterone production by the adrenal gland that is a major regulator of renal and intestinal na+ transport  <cit> . the present studies demonstrate that aii has direct effects on intestinal epithelial na+ transport that are consistent with its desired effect to increase fluid absorption. although aii has been noted to increase small intestinal na+ absorption previously  <cit> , the present studies provide a more definitive analysis, demonstrating that this is due to stimulated exocytosis of the apical transporter nhe <dig> and later increased expression of this transporter. in contrast, nhe <dig> activity is not regulated by aii. nhe <dig> has a lesser contribution to intestinal na+ transport  <cit>  and is regulated differently by agonist-activated second messenger pathways  <cit> .

the actions of aii on intestinal epithelial na transport appear to involve both acute and chronic effects. acutely, aii rapidly stimulates insertion of nhe <dig> into the apical membrane which increases na+ absorption. however, over time, aii stimulates transcriptional activation of the nhe <dig> gene, resulting in increases in total nhe <dig> protein abundance. this second phase is associated with additional apical membrane insertion of nhe <dig> and enhanced na absorptive capacity. the effects of aii on intestinal transport could be either indirect and/or direct and the present studies demonstrate that direct effects occur. when aii was given intravascularly, it stimulated the enteric nervous system which could affect intestinal electrolyte transport  <cit> . however, when aii was added to in vitro preparations of rat small intestine serosally, it stimulated na+ transport, suggesting that aii was acting directly on epithelial cells  <cit>  similar to present results in mouse jejunum. adding further support to this possibility, aii binds with high affinity to intestinal enterocyte membranes  <cit> . more recent studies of porcine jejunum found both types of the aii receptor, however full thickness intestine was used for analysis which contains both epithelial and non-epithelial cell components  <cit> . luminal/brush border type i and ii aii receptors have been functionally demonstrated in intestine where luminal aii, through the type i receptor, inhibits apical na+-dependent glucose transport  <cit> . a similar finding of brush border type i aii receptor regulates apical glucose uptake in llc-pk porcine kidney cells  <cit> . the effects on apical sodium transport were not measured in these studies of intestinal and renal brush border membranes.

the intestine possesses a complete renin-angiotensin system  <cit>  that appears to have local autocrine and paracrine effects  <cit> . angiotensinogen, renin and the angiotensin converting enzyme are all expressed in the intestine, as well as both types of aii receptors  <cit> . from the present studies, we cannot determine the role of systemic versus locally produced aii. indeed, regulation of these 'local' renin-angiotensin systems has received modest investigation. in the intestine, activity of the na+-dependent glucose transporter, but not leucine transporter, was decreased by aii, an effect that may be related to its effects on the brush border  <cit> .

the present studies strongly support the type i receptor as the mediator of the aii effects on the acute stimulation of nhe <dig>  the signal transduction pathways of the type i aii receptor are complex and involve multiple pathways. in a cultured small intestinal cell line, iec- <dig>  aii stimulates several transduction pathways including phospholipase d, certain isoforms of protein kinase c, and activation of the egf receptor  <cit>  that stimulate cell growth.

CONCLUSIONS
aii can directly stimulate intestinal epithelial na+ absorption through the aii-receptor activation of several key signaling pathways that induce acute and chronic changes in nhe <dig> membrane trafficking and gene transcription. these processes involve rapid exocytosis of the major non-nutrient na+ absorptive pathway, nhe <dig> via activation of the type i receptor and activation of complex transduction pathways. aii does not, however, stimulate exocytosis and activity of the related exchanger nhe <dig>  aii activation of the intestinal epithelial cells also has more prolonged effects on fluid and electrolyte absorption and homeostasis as expression of the exchanger nhe <dig> is increased. we conclude that angiotensin ii has a direct role in regulating intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption which may contribute to its overall effects in regulation systemic volume and blood pressure.
