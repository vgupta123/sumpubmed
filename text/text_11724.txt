BACKGROUND
melioidosis is a serious infectious disease caused by burkholderia pseudomallei , a gram-negative bacterium that is classified as a category b bioterrorism agent by centers for disease control and prevention  <cit> . it is found in soil and water and is endemic in the region between 20°n and 20°s of the equator including southeast asian countries and northern australia  <cit> . this soil-saprophyte is a facultative intracellular organism that can multiply readily in murine phagocytic and non-phagocytic cell lines  <cit> . it is the causative agent of the potentially fatal disease, meloidiosis, which occurs in both humans and animals. human melioidosis has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from a seropositive subclinical condition to an acute fatal septicemia  <cit> .

b. thailandensis  is a non-pathogenic environmental saprophyte that was formerly considered to be an avirulent biotype of bp  <cit> . it is genetically and phenotypically very similar to bp but is markedly less virulent in both human and animal models. for example, bp is at least 106-fold more virulent than bt in balb/c mice and so far none of the  <dig>  clinical isolates reported have displayed the bt phenotype  <cit> . bt is usually present together with bp in the regions where melioidosis is endemic, e.g., northeast thailand  <cit> . in order to further delineate the pathogenesis mechanism of bp in humans, which remain largely unresolved, the in vitro interactions of bp strain  <dig> and bt strain ue <dig> with primary human phagocytic cells were compared. we previously showed that bp adhered to and invaded a human epithelial cell line more efficiently than bt  <cit> . in the present study, we continued this line of study by comparing the intracellular survival and growth kinetics of bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells  and human macrophages  and the respective host cell responses with regard to costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production and modc-driven allogeneic t cell differentiation.

RESULTS
intracellular survival and replication of bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> in human modcs and mφs
in order to study the intracellular survival and growth kinetics of both burkholderia strains, primary human modcs and mφs, cells were infected with bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> and the number of viable intracellular bacteria was determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr after infection . given the protocol used, the earliest time point where the number of intracellular bacteria could be determined was  <dig> hours post infection . at this initial stage of infection, the mean level of intracellular bp- <dig> in the modcs was higher than that in bt-ue <dig> , although the difference was not statistically significant . as the infection progressed, the intracellular numbers of both bacteria, as measured at t <dig>  declined compared with the 3-hr time point. at later time points , however, both bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> multiplied exponentially inside modcs and exhibited similar kinetics until the experiment was terminated , thus resulting in similar numbers of intracellular bacteria  <dig> hr after infection.

the results in mφs were markedly different in that intracellular growth of bp- <dig> was much better than that of bt-ue <dig>  while the numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for both organisms in the early stages of growth , the number of intracellular bp- <dig> was significantly higher at t <dig> . in fact, the growth of bt-ue <dig> was completely halted between t <dig> and t <dig>  the difference was more clear when comparing the intracellular growth rates of the two organisms in mφs. bp- <dig> grew with a doubling time of  <dig> hr  <dig> min in mφs  while that for bt-ue <dig> could not be determined as the level of intracellular bt-ue <dig> was relatively low and remained at the same level throughout the observation period. moreover, the replication rate of both bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> during the exponential growth phase  was higher inside modcs  than that of bp- <dig> in mφs . it should be mentioned that the intracellular growth rates of both organisms in both primary phagocytic cell cultures were considerably lower than those in the cell-free culture medium . in conclusion, whereas both burkholderia stains survived and replicated equally well in modcs, the intracellular growth of bt-ue <dig>  but not bp- <dig>  was significantly suppressed in mφs.

pre-activation of mφs with recombinant human ifn-γ for  <dig> hr prior to infection resulted in a reduction in the intracellular survival of bp- <dig> in a dose-dependent manner, as judged from the number of intracellular bacteria determined  <dig> hr after the infection was started . although the intracellular survival was only significantly reduced when the ifn-γ was added to the mφs at final concentration of  <dig> u/ml , some reduction in survival, relative to the untreated control, could still be observed with ifn-γ pre-treatment at concentrations as low as  <dig> u/ml . in modcs pre-treated with  <dig> u/ml ifn-γ, a significant reduction  in the intracellular level of bp- <dig> was also observed, but the level of reduction was less than that noted in mφs . the effect of ifn-γ on bacterial survival was not the result of reduced bacterial uptake since both ifn-γ-treated and untreated cells displayed similar numbers of intracellular bacteria at the  <dig> hr post-infection time point . thus, this set of experiments showed that ifn-γ could stimulate mφs, and to a lesser extent modcs, to acquire enhanced antibacterial killing capacity to reduce the intracellular survival and growth of bp- <dig> 

upregulation of costimulatory molecules, surface markers and cytokine production in bp-844- and bt-ue5-infected cells
given the different fates on intracellular bacterial survival profiles noted above, it was of interest to examine the effect of bacterial infection on the production of host costimulatory molecules, surface markers and cytokines. exposure of modcs to bp- <dig> and bt-ue5at a moi of  <dig> for  <dig> hr readily induced cell maturation as judged by significant increases in the levels of the maturation marker, cd <dig> . under the same conditions, both bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> induced upregulation of the costimulatory molecule, cd <dig>  in modcs and mφs . the effect of bacterial infection on the upregulation of other costimulatory molecules varied. for example, while the levels of cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  in modcs also increased, it was rather surprising to observe that infection of mφs with either bp- <dig> or bt-ue <dig> actually caused a reduction in the levels of cd <dig> and cd11b . the reduction noted with the mφs is unlikely to be related to a technical artifact because when compared with the background mfi  obtained with pbs, escherichia coli lps also slightly depressed cd11b expression, a finding that is consistent with earlier reports by other investigators using some other human mφmodels  <cit> .

infection with either bp- <dig> or bp-ue <dig> stimulated similar degrees of cytokine secretion in modcs and mφs. significant elevations in the levels of il- <dig> and tnf-α  were found in the supernatant fluid of the mφcultures infected with either bp- <dig> or bt-ue <dig> . infection with either organism also stimulated production of il- <dig> and il-12p <dig>  in the modc cultures . the level of il-12p <dig> and not the tnf-α was determined in the modc supernatants because it is more readily related to the polarization of naïve t cells to th <dig> phenotype  <cit> . the proportion of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines induced by these  <dig> bacteria was calculated and found to be not different from one another . it should be mentioned that the changes in the levels of costimulatory molecules and the increased secretion of cytokines induced by these  <dig> bacteria did not depend on their invasive properties or the numbers of bacteria internalized as exposure to organisms that had been killed by pfa treatment induced changes in cytokine and costimulatory molecule levels that were similar to those observed using living bacteria . in summary, bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> appeared to exert roughly similar influences on the cellular responses of modcs and mφs, judging from the expression levels of costimulatory molecules and cytokine production.

t helper cell differentiation profiles induced by bp-844- and bt-ue5-stimulated modcs
we compared the ability of bp-844-and bt-ue5-stimulated modcs to induce th1-th <dig> differentiation. a modc-allogeneic naïve cd4+ co-culture system was employed essentially as described earlier by bergman et al. . modcs from  <dig> different donors that had been exposed to pfa-fixed bp- <dig> or bt-ue <dig> were incubated with allogeneic t cells and the extent of t-cell polarization was determined . scatter plots of flow cytometry analyses from one representative modc donor are separately shown in figure 3b. the results with all  <dig> donors showed that modcs exposed to either of the pfa-fixed bacteria biased toward a th <dig> polarization, based on the observation that the majority of t cells in samples that had been exposed to the bacteria produced intracellular ifn-γ which is a characteristic of th <dig> cells. in conclusion, stimulation of modcs with either bp- <dig> or bt-ue <dig> induced indistinguishable t-helper cell profiles, i.e., both predominantly induced naïve t cells to differentiate to a th <dig> cell population.

discussion
different lines of evidence from patients with melioidosis, including the elevation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum, suggest the importance of innate immunity in determining the outcome of infection  <cit> . there is also evidence in humans showing that recovery from melioidosis may depend, in part, on cell-mediated arm of adaptive immune system  <cit> . the latter is partially dependent on the type of th cell differentiation which is controlled in part by activated dcs. studies of experimentally induced melioidosis in different inbred strains of animals have shown the importance of genetic background in determining the course of the infection  <cit> . despite numerous studies in animal melioidosis models using mutant and wild type bacteria  <cit>  a complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, particularly in humans, has yet to be realized. we felt that additional approaches looking at the effects of infection on isolated human phagocytic cell populations would contribute new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. we also reasoned that using virulent bp as well as its genetically related avirulent natural counterpart, bt, might highlight aspects of the host response that play a role in virulence and pathogenesis. moreover, the use of primary human cells, instead of animal cells or cell lines, would yield results that are more relevant in regard to the human disease. we had previously demonstrated that this same bp strain adhered to and invaded a non-phagocytic human lung alveolar cell line more effectively than bt-ue <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we continued this same approach, but this time using primary human phagocytic cells instead of a non-phagocytic human and animal cell lines. after internalization, we found that bt strain ue <dig> but not bp strain  <dig>  had a reduced survival rate and failed to multiply in the mφs . we have limited data confirming that another bp stain  could also survive and readily replicate inside primary human macrophages . from the current information regarding the different characteristics between these  <dig> burkholderia species, we suspect that exopolysaccharide capsular components  <cit>  or the type-iii secretion system cluster  <dig>  <cit> , which are absent in bt, may be responsible for the differences in their intracellular survival kinetics. currently, we have data showing that, compared with its wild type counterpart, a capsule mutant of bp that lacks the exopolysaccharide component was at least 105-fold less virulent in balb/c mice and it also survived and replicated poorly inside primary human mφs .

furthermore, our results showed that following ifn-γ activation, both modcs and mφs acquired an enhanced ability to kill bp- <dig>  the significance of ifn-γ in conferring resistance against experimental melioidosis has been reported previously by several groups of investigators  <cit>  including our own group  <cit> . unactivated modcs, while possessing an antigen-presenting capacity for the stimulation of the adaptive immune response that is superior to that of mφs, were unable to inhibit the intracellular growth of either burkholderia strains . however, after ifn-γ pre-activation, an enhanced intracellular killing capacity was observed in the modcs infected with bp- <dig> . in vivo, ifn-γ can be produced by nk cells or th <dig> cells  <cit> , but their arrival at the initial site of infection might be too late to provide an effective antibacterial response. we previously showed that injecting balb/c mice with cpg odn to enhance ifn-γ production and innate immunity in general could effectively protect the animals against a subsequent challenge with virulent bp  <cit> . furthermore, we found that if the cpg odn administration was given closer to the time of bacterial challenge, the degree of protection was also reduced. as demonstrated in the present study, the enhanced in vitro killing of bp- <dig> by human modcs and mφs pre-stimulated with ifn-γ  is in accord with the previously mentioned in vivo observations in experimental animals. taken together, it appears that the host innate immune response is able to distinguish bp- <dig> from bt-ue <dig> , and this may in turn influence the outcome of primary infection by bp. once the infection has progressed beyond this stage, the host adaptive immune system will be activated but may not be able to distinguish between these  <dig> bacteria, as demonstrated by our results showing the similar patterns of costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production and strong bias toward a th <dig> polarization . in addition, the results of our in vitro studies showing that human modcs that have been exposed to bp- <dig> have predominant biased effects on th <dig> cell differentiation  are consistent with the results of a previous study showing strong th <dig> cell-mediated immune responses in melioidosis patients who had recovered from melioidosis  <cit> . moreover, a mixed th1/th <dig> response has also been reported in animal studies  <cit> . the detection of some activated t cells exhibiting a mixed th1/th <dig> response producing both intracellular ifn-γ and il- <dig> in this study  is in accord with the animal study just mentioned. further investigations using the human phagocytic cell system described in the present study are needed if one is to more fully understand the pathogenesis of human melioidosis. we are currently investigating the possible role and involvement of polymorphonuclear cells in the disease process in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
our comparative study showed that while both bp- <dig> and bt-ue <dig> were similar in their ability to survive and replicate in human modcs, only bp- <dig> could replicate in human mφs. both bacteria, however, possessed a similar capacity to stimulate dc maturation, cytokine production and t cell polarization toward a th <dig> phenotype. it is possible that the superior ability of bp- <dig> to survive and replicate in phagocytes may contribute to the virulence of the organism and thus may influence the outcome of infection in the human host.
