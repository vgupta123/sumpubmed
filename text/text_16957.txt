BACKGROUND
safflower  is an ancient oilseed crop that is currently grown for its high quality edible oil used in cooking, salad dressings and margarines, and to a lesser degree as a bird seed. the characteristics of oils are highly dependent on their fatty acid composition. oleic acid  and linoleic acid  are the two major fatty acids found in safflower seed oil, together accounting for about 90% of the total fatty acids. conventional safflower oil is characterised by its relatively high level of linoleic acid content about 70% compared to most other oilseed crops  <cit> . in the past six decades, breeders have exploited safflower’s natural genetic diversity to modify the oleate/linoleate ratio for particular end use purposes. numerous breeding lines with high levels of either oleic acid  or linoleic acid  have been selected. the relative proportions of these two major fatty acids determine relevant technological and nutritional properties of edible oils  <cit> . nutritionally, both oleic acid and linoleic acid can lower total serum cholesterols, however, oleic acid has higher oxidative stability compared to linoleic acid as it contains one less double bond. therefore raising oleic acid content at the expense of linoleic acid has been set as an important research objective for the improvement of many oilseed crops, including safflower, to provide highly stable cooking oils without the need for hydrogenation, a process that can result in the formation of nutritionally undesirable trans fatty acid  <cit> . beyond food applications, high oleic oils also have significant existing and potential industrial uses, such as in improved biodiesel, lubricants, and hydraulic oils because of the high oxidative stability needed in these products. purified oleic acid is also a valuable industrial chemical feedstock, and can be cleaved to form derivatives such as azelaic acid that can be used in the formulation of a range of industrial products and polymers  <cit> .

the distinct fatty acid compositions found in seed storage oil and membrane lipids are the result of an intricate metabolic network that regulates fatty acid biosynthesis and flux through both prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways  <cit> . it is understood that the chloroplast Δ12-desaturase  is necessary for desaturating 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> fatty acids to 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> on all 16:1- or 18:1-containing chloroplast membrane lipids including phosphatidyl glycerol , monogalactosyldiacylglycerol , digalactosyldiaclyglycerol , and sulfoguinovosyldiacylglycerol   <cit> . the enzyme primarily responsible for the synthesis of linoleic acid from oleic acid in seed storage lipids is the microsomal oleoyl phosphatidylcholine desaturase  that introduces a double bond at the Δ <dig> position of oleic acid on phosphatidylcholine , forming linoleic acid on the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . variants of the fad <dig> enzyme are also known to have diversified functionalities in fatty acid modification, catalysing hydroxylation  <cit> , epoxidation  <cit> , and the formation of acetylenic bonds  <cit>  and conjugated double bonds  <cit> . some functionally divergent fad <dig> enzymes are multi-functional, such as the bifunctional hydroxylase/desaturase from lesquerella fendleri <cit> , and tri-functional acetylenase from crepis alpina, which can also catalyse the formation of both trans and cis double bonds at the Δ <dig> position of oleic acid  <cit> .

membrane integrity and function, determined by structure and fluidity, are largely affected by lipid composition and the degree of fatty acid desaturation in plants  <cit> . because the fad <dig> enzyme is the key step in the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids it plays an essential role in the biophysical characteristics of cell membranes and is often induced in response to various environmental stimuli such as extreme temperatures  <cit> , high salt  <cit> , and pathogen attack  <cit> . the expression of fad <dig> leading to the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids is also important to the specific signal transduction pathways, such as jasmonic acid pathway that is known to be a critical factor in plant defence system and male fertility  <cit> .

since the cloning of first plant fad <dig> gene in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , its orthologous dna sequences have been isolated and characterised from many different plant species, including soybean  <cit> , rape  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , peanut  <cit>  and flax  <cit> . only a single fad <dig> gene exists in arabidopsis, but in most other plant species fad <dig> is encoded by small gene families. for example, fad <dig> is encoded by three distinct family members in soybean  <cit>  and by four members in cotton  <cit> . here we report the discovery, isolation and characterisation of an unprecedentedly large fad <dig> gene family from safflower. phylogenetic analysis of eleven full length cdnas and their distinct genomic structural features indicated that they are non-allelic and have likely evolved through gene duplication at several hierarchical levels. their distinct expression patterns were revealed by real time quantitative pcr  of different safflower tissues. functional divergence of the fad <dig> family members was explored by heterologous expression in yeast and transient expression in nicotiana benthamiana.

RESULTS
cloning and sequencing analysis of multiple members of safflower ctfad <dig> gene family
two different full length cdnas, designated as ctfad2- <dig> and ctfad2- <dig>  were isolated from the lambda cdna library derived from safflower developing embryos, using arabidopsis fad <dig> dna sequence as a probe. the arabidopsis fad <dig> dna sequence was also used to “blast” search the expressed sequence tags  database generated by the compositae genome project . from the total  <dig>  safflower ests at the time we searched, at least eleven distinct fad <dig> cdna sequence contigs were identified and designated. in addition to ctfad2- <dig> and ctfad2- <dig> that had already been isolated from the developing embryo cdna library, a further  <dig> partial cdnas were designated as ctfad2- <dig> through to ctfad2- <dig>  respectively. gene specific primers were designed from each of the partial cdna sequences, and the full length cdna were obtained by conducting 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cdna ends  reaction on rnas derived from various safflower plant tissues, including leaf, root, hypocotyl and flower head. the amplified fragment was subcloned into the pgem-teasy vector and sequenced from both directions. sequence comparisons of the 3′ and 5′ ends with the corresponding ests showed overlapping regions that matched with each other. subsequently full length cdnas encoding the  <dig> distinct partial fad <dig> ests were obtained by assembling the race product with corresponding ests. each cdna contains an uninterrupted coding region that shares extensive sequence homology with each other, and unique 5′ and 3′ untranslated region  sequences. the putative polypeptides were varied between 372- <dig> amino acids. the sequence similarity among these  <dig> ctfad <dig> coding regions at both nucleotide and amino acid levels is listed in table  <dig>  it was also revealed that the putative polypeptides of the  <dig> ctfad <dig> genes share about 50%-65% sequence identity to orthologous fad <dig> enzymes in other plants.

to elucidate phylogenetic relationship of safflower fad <dig> genes, the  <dig> deduced polypeptide sequences were aligned with orthologous fad <dig> sequences and a neighbour-joining tree was constructed using vector nti. as shown in figure  <dig>  ctfad2- <dig> and ctfad2- <dig> are aligned next to each other and to other seed expressed fad2s, such as sunflower hafad2- <dig> and cotton ghfad2- <dig>  ctfad2- <dig> is aligned together with other constitutively expressed genes, such as sunflower hafad2- <dig> and hafad2- <dig>  ctfad2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> form a new branch, most likely to have recently become divergent. interestingly it is embedded deep in a clade with functionally divergent fad <dig> fatty acid modifying enzymes, such as fatty acid acetylenases and epoxygenases. ctfad2- <dig> is also aligned together with fatty acid acetylenases from several plant species, including the sunflower vfad <dig> that was induced by fungal elicitors  <cit> . 

the alignment of the putative polypeptide sequences of ctfad2s together with the selected plant orthologs is given in . similar to other plant fad <dig>  the putative polypeptides of ctfad2s contain an aromatic amino acid-rich motif, at the c-terminus, which is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining localization in the er  <cit> . consistent with other plant membrane bound fatty acid desaturase enzymes, the putative polypeptides deduced from all eleven safflower ctfad <dig> cdnas contain three highly conserved histidine-rich motifs that have been implicated in the formation of the diiron-oxygen complex used in biochemical catalysis  <cit> . the first histidine motif is hecghh in majority of ctfad <dig> putative polypeptide sequences, except ctfad2- <dig> and - <dig> that have hdcghh, hdlghh, respectively. the last amino acid his  has been converted to a gln  in ctfad- <dig> . we have compared this motif in  <dig> plant fad <dig> enzymes and the h to q substitution is also present in a diverged fad <dig> homologue from lesquerella lindheimeri with predominantly fatty acid hydroxylase activity  <cit> . the second histidine motif is highly conserved as hrrhh in several safflower fad2s, including ctfad2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it is noteworthy that at + <dig> of the motif an asn  substitution was found in ctfad2- <dig>  consistent with a number of functionally divergent fad2s, including crepis alpina crep <dig> , c. palaestina cpal <dig>  and sunflower vfad <dig> , calendula officinalis fac <dig> , rudbeckia hirta acetylenase . either a ser  or thr  substitution spotted at this position in ctfad2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

in ctfad2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> the amino acid immediately preceding the first histidine box is an ala , consistent with other plant fad <dig> Δ <dig> oleate desaturase enzymes. ala substitution by val  occurred in ctfad2- <dig>  while other six ctfad <dig> enzymes have gly  in this position. it was proposed by cahoon et al. <cit>  that gly substitution of ala at this position has been consistently found in functionally divergent fad <dig> enzymes, except Δ <dig> hydroxylase. it is noted that only ctfad2- <dig> has a dvth motif, in the - <dig> to - <dig> positions of the third histidine box, which fits with the vx motif proposed to occur in all plant acetylenases  <cit> . the five amino acids immediately behind the third histidine box of ctfad2- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  are lfstm as for other known plant fad <dig> Δ <dig> oleate desaturases. in contrast, ctfad2- <dig> has an lfsyi motif at this position with two amino acid substitutions at + <dig> and + <dig> position. in ctfad2- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the s at the + <dig> position is substituted by pro , which is also exclusively present in other fad <dig> fatty acid conjugases, including those from calendula officinalis  and trichosanthes kirilowii .

it was shown that the serine- <dig> of soybean seed-specific gmfad2- <dig> sequences is phosphorylated during seed development  <cit> , as a regulatory mechanism for its enzymatic activity. among the  <dig> safflower fad <dig> enzymes only ctfad2- <dig>  the seed-specific fad <dig>  has the serine corresponding with that in soybean fad2- <dig>  it is tempting to predict that the same posttranslational regulatory mechanism of fad <dig> expression through phosphorylation of target site including the serine- <dig> may play an important role in modulating microsomal Δ <dig> oleate desaturation during safflower seed development and oil accumulation.

genomic structures and evolutionary studies of the ctfad <dig> gene family in safflower
in the context of elucidating the gene structure of fad <dig> from safflower, an intron that is situated in the 5′ utr of fad <dig> genes was isolated. from each of the  <dig> safflower fad <dig> cdna sequences, the typical splice site  was predicted and pcr primers were designed for amplification of such an intron from genomic dna. the predicted 5′ intron was obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> ctfad <dig> genes, including ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  the major features of the primary dna sequences of these ctfad <dig> introns are summarised in table  <dig>  the intron was not amplified from ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  likely because the 5′ utr in which the introns reside is incomplete in our clones. all of the eight intron sequences were located within the 5′ utr, at positions that varied between  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream of the putative start codon, the first atg. the intron length varied between  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and was  <dig>  bp for ctfad2- <dig>  similar in size to the introns identified in fad <dig> genes from arabidopsis , cotton  <cit>  and sesame   <cit> . the variations in the relative positions and the substantial differences in the sizes of the 5′-utr introns are distinguishing structural differences among safflower fad <dig> genes, which could be important in differential expression of the genes. the large intron present in the 5′-utr of fad <dig> genes could play an important role in expression regulation, as it has been reported to have positive effects on the expression of reporter genes in sesame  <cit> . the equivalent intron has also been shown to be an effective target for posttranscriptional gene silencing of fad <dig> in soybean  <cit> . 

the putative splice sites, at both 5′ exon/intron and 3′ intron/exon, are conserved as ag:gt in most of the eight ctfad <dig> genes, except the 5′ exon/intron  in ctfad2- <dig>  and both the 5′ exon/intron  and 3′ intron/exon  in ctfad2- <dig>  however, the intron sequences themselves are all highly divergent without any significant homology among them. these intron sequences are at-rich with at content between 61% and 75%, consistent with other dicot intron sequences. analyzing the intron sequences by the place program  identified several putative cis-regulatory elements. for instance, a few motifs, such as abre and sef <dig>  commonly present in seed-specific promoters were located in the seed-specific ctfad2- <dig>  likewise, an ag-motif that is often present in the promoter of defence-related genes induced by various stresses, such as wounding or elicitor treatment, was located in the ctfad2- <dig> gene that is specifically expressed in the hypocotyls and cotyledons of young safflower seedlings.

analysis safflower ctfad <dig> gene family by southern blot analysis
the complexity of the fad <dig> gene family in safflower was also examined by low stringency southern blot analysis and confirmed that safflower fad <dig> is encoded by a complex multigene family . the restriction fragment patterns derived from various restriction enzymes are consistent with there being more than  <dig> fad <dig> genes in safflower. the variation in the intensity of hybridization signals reflects the relative levels of sequence similarity with the probe dna used.

expression profile of ctfad <dig> genes in different tissues
to determine tissue expression patterns of the various ctfad <dig> genes, rt-pcr analysis was carried out with total rna extracted from cotyledon, hypocotyl, root and leaf tissues derived from young seedlings, as well as flower tissues and developing embryos of safflower genotype su. no product was detectable after  <dig> cycles of amplification in control reactions without reverse transcriptase, demonstrating the absence of genomic dna in rna samples.

as shown in figure  <dig>  ctfad2- <dig> is specifically expressed in developing seeds, with little if any expression detected in the somatic tissues examined. ctfad2- <dig> is expressed at low levels in seeds as well as in all other tissues examined. ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> showed no expression in developing embryos. low, yet detectable levels of ctfad2- <dig> and - <dig> expression were observed in developing seeds, especially in the late development stage. ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> showed high expression in young seedling tissues including cotyledons and hypocotyls. ctfad2- <dig> and - <dig> appear to be root-specific and ctfad2- <dig> is mostly expressed in flower tissues, with relatively low levels detected in other tissues.

expression of safflower ctfad <dig> genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae
expression in yeast  cells has been successfully used for studying the functional properties of several plant fad <dig> Δ <dig> oleate fatty acid desaturases  <cit>  because it has a simple fatty acid profile, contains ample oleic acid that can serve as precursor for fad <dig> enzymes, and lacks an endogenous fad <dig> activity. as shown in figure  <dig>  polyunsaturated fatty acids including c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> were not produced in the control yeast cells transformed with the empty pyes <dig> vector. by reference to the standard gas chromatogram of c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> fatty acid methyl esters  having retention time of  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, respectively, c18: <dig> was found to be present in the yeast lines expressing ctfad2- <dig> , ctfad2- <dig> , ctfad2- <dig> , and c16: <dig> was seen in yeast lines expressing ctfad2- <dig>  and ctfad2- <dig> . this result indicated that ctfad2- <dig>  ctfad2- <dig> and ctfad2- <dig> are Δ <dig> oleate desaturases that convert oleic acid to linoleic acid. it appears that ctfad2- <dig> is a Δ <dig> palmitoleate desaturase that prefers c16: <dig> to c18: <dig> substrate, leading to specific production of c16: <dig>  as shown in figure 4f and figure 4g, the expression of ctfad2- <dig> resulted in two minor, yet distinct peaks, at retention time of  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, respectively. the latter peak is corresponding to fame of linoleic acid ,12), and the former peak was identified as fame of its Δ <dig> trans isomer ,12) by gc-ms of their pyrrolidide adducts, and  <dig> -dimethyloxazoline  modification . the fatty acid composition of yeast cells expressing ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> is shown in table  <dig>  as shown in the table  <dig>  the expression of ctfad2- <dig> produced  <dig> % c16: <dig>  without any c18: <dig>  no new peaks were detected in yeast cells expressing ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  

to examine whether any ctfad <dig> have fatty acid hydroxylase activity, fames prepared from the yeast cells expressing each of the  <dig> ctfad <dig> genes were reacted with a silyating reagent that can convert hydroxyl residues into tms-ether derivatives from which the mass spectrum can be examined. however, none of hydroxyl derivatives of common fatty acids, such as ricinoleic acid synthesised from oleic acid, was detected in any of the yeast cell lines expressing ctfad <dig> genes, indicating the absence of fatty acid hydroxylase activity in the ctfad <dig> enzymes. further tests for potential epoxygenase and acetylenase activities that use linoleic acid as substrate have also been carried out in these transgenic yeast cell lines, by supplementing free linoleic acid in the yeast culture upon the induction by galactose. no novel peaks representing epoxy or acetylenic fatty acids were detected .

transient expression in n. benthamiana leaves
the function of ctfad2- <dig> was initially assessed by expression in s. cerevisiae, and two novel fatty acids were identified by gc-ms as 18:2Δ <dig>  and 18:2Δ <dig>  respectively. consistent with the results obtained from yeast, constitutive expression of ctfad2- <dig> driven by 35s camv promoter in n. benthamiana leaves, co-expressed with 35s:p <dig> yielded a novel product that is not present in n. benthamiana leaf when infiltrated with 35s:p <dig> alone . the methyl ester of this new product displayed a gc retention time  that was identical to that of a methyl 18:2Δ <dig>  . the novel 18:2Δ <dig>  accounted for  <dig> % of the fatty acids of leaves transiently expressing ctfad2- <dig> . in addition, another new peak that was not observed in the yeast cultures was detected at retention time of  <dig>  min . the total ion chromatogram and mass spectrum of this new fatty acid were consistent with that of crepenynic acid  , demonstrating that the ctfad2- <dig> polypeptide had Δ12-acetylenase activity as suggested by its close sequence alignments with known Δ <dig> fatty acid acetylenases. as shown in table  <dig>  crepenynic acid accounts for  <dig> % of total fatty acids in n. benthamiana leaves expressing ctfad2- <dig> 

it is notable that the expression of ctfad2- <dig> transiently in the n. benthamiana cells resulted in a significant increase of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty acids including linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid , relative to the untransformed control . overall, the results from the yeast and n. benthamiana expression experiments indicated that ctfad2- <dig> functioned primarily as a Δ <dig> oleate desaturase lacking stereo-specificity, producing both linoleic acid and its trans-Δ <dig> isomer. in addition, it could also further desaturate the Δ <dig> double bond of linoleic acid to form the acetylenic bond of crepenynic acid.

the other  <dig> ctfad <dig> genes have also been expressed in n. benthamiana leaves, but we did not observe production of any additional novel fatty acids compared to the controls .

discussion
we report here the cloning of  <dig> distinct safflower ctfad <dig> genes, which does not include at least three more partial severely truncated est sequences that are also present in the cpg safflower est database. furthermore, due to the current lack of safflower genomics information it remains unclear whether there are additional unexpressed fad <dig> members. taken together, this is to our knowledge the largest fad <dig> gene family in any species examined to date. in spite of their high conservation of putative amino acid sequences, individual ctfad <dig> genes have clear distinguishing features, especially with respect to their n- and c-terminal ends, 5′ and 3′ utr regions, and the size, location and sequence of an intron located at the 5′ utr.

fad <dig> is among the best-studied plant fatty acid desaturase gene families, in terms of both molecular and biochemical investigations. although only a single representative was identified in arabidopsis  <cit> , fad <dig> appears to exist as complex gene families in most other plant genomes studied so far. two distinct fad <dig> genes have been described in soybean  <cit> , flax  <cit>  and olive  <cit> ; three genes in sunflower  <cit>  and camelina sativa <cit> ; and four genes in cotton  <cit> . in the amphitetraploid brassica napus, 4- <dig> different fad <dig> genes have been identified in each diploid sub-genome  <cit> .

although comparable studies are lacking, it seems that safflower is unusual with respect to fad <dig> gene family evolution. safflower is a self-pollinating diploid plant species that is most closely related to a wild diploid species c. palaestinus and extensive genome duplication or re-arrangement has not previously been reported in safflower  <cit> . in the absence of genomic data, it is not known whether the significant amplification in gene copy number observed for fad <dig> also occurs for other gene families in safflower. however, our own limited observations of other safflower lipid biosynthesis genes do not show evidence for such expansive gene family size .

the complex fad <dig> family cannot be attributed to alternative splicing as fad <dig> genes do not contain introns in the coding region sequence. instead, gene duplication is more likely responsible for creating the fad <dig> family complexity in safflower. topology of the gene tree show that gene duplications have probably occurred at several hierarchical levels, i.e. at various times during evolution. for example, the ctfad2- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> are more closely related to each other than they are to other safflower fad <dig> sequences, indicating that more recent gene duplications are responsible for the emergence of this clade. it is not known how many fad <dig> genes were generated after the speciation of safflower, in other words, are unique to the c. tinctorius species. analysis of fad <dig> genes from taxonomically closely related plant species, such as those from the genus centaurea within the asteraceae family, could perhaps provide a better picture of exactly when the duplication events occurred.

genetic redundancy is a prime feature of plant genomes, providing the opportunity for additional divergent functions to evolve while retaining the original function of vital genes. to persist over long periods of evolutionary time, new gene duplications must be positively selected for, otherwise they can degenerate to pseudogenes by accumulating nonsense mutations, frame shifts and even insertion/deletion events. once becoming a pseudogene, the likely fate is to continue to accumulate mutations at the maximum rate and become increasingly divergent. the fact that all the  <dig> ctfad <dig> genes are expressed and translated is evidence that at least these duplicated fad <dig> genes are positively selected in safflower. as the current research focused on the expressed fad <dig> genes, it is plausible that other duplicated fad <dig> genes might have lost expression and functionality through gene pseudogenization or gene deletion.

the production of linoleic acid through the Δ <dig> desaturation catalyzed by fad <dig> is central to the functionality of biological membrane systems, cellular signalling, thermal adaptation, and energy storage  <cit> . when plants are subject to adverse environmental conditions, a wide range of cellular response occurs, including the adjustments of unsaturation levels of membrane fatty acids. plant membrane integrity and function, determined by structure and fluidity, are significantly affected by lipid composition, particularly the degree of fatty acid desaturation  <cit> . abiotic environmental stresses such as cold, heat, drought and salt are able to induce changes in fatty acid composition. expression of fad <dig> is also regulated by adverse environmental factors, suggesting the possible involvement of fad <dig> in plant response to abiotic stress  <cit> . during recent years a number of fad2-divergent genes have been identified in other members of the asteraceae family that safflower belongs to, such as marigold , crepis alpina and sunflower   <cit>  and have been associated with synthesis of divergent fatty acid structures that may play roles in resistance to biotic stresses. for example, the epoxygenated fatty acids were found to be potent inhibitors for the germination and enlargement of spores of rice blast fungus  <cit> . other unusual fatty acids, acetylenic fatty acids, are involved in the biosynthesis of polyacetylenes that act as phytoalexins in numerous asteraceae species including safflower and therefore play a significant role in plant disease resistance  <cit> .

it is intriguing how the divergent fad <dig> gene family members with similar fundamental properties carry out specific functions. the intrinsic characteristics of various fad <dig> genes, as exemplified by some conserved motifs, are likely determining their distinct expression patterns and abilities to respond to environmental stimuli, and diversified functionalities. it has been demonstrated through site directed mutagenesis that very few amino acid changes are required to change the enzymatic function of a fad <dig> gene. for instance, as few as four amino acid changes in a fad <dig> fatty acid desaturase were required in order to obtain hydroxylase activity, and conversely, substitution of six amino acids could convert a fatty acid hydroxylase into a fatty acid desaturase  <cit> . the Δ <dig> acetylenase from crepis alpina deviates from Δ <dig> desaturase in  <dig> positions  <cit> , but it has not been determined how many of these changes are required to facilitate the functionality alteration. it is suggested that a switch from desaturase to acetylenase might involve more extensive changes in sequence than that required to interchange between a fatty acid desaturase and a fatty acid hydroxylase. the origins of specificity leading to acetylenases and desaturases are not currently evident from comparisons at the primary sequence level, and residues promoting acetylenase activity have yet to be located. interestingly, a gly replaces ala at the amino acid immediate preceding the first his box in all the known acetylenases, in contrast to a typical fatty acid desaturase or hydroxylase. it is suggested that this residue may facilitate acetylenase chemistry by alleviating steric hindrance by providing substrate pocket spatial flexibility to permit the conversion of a “kinked” substrate  into a straight chain product   <cit> .

we have identified that, although a large functional fad <dig> gene family exists in safflower, only fad2- <dig> has exclusively high expression in developing safflower seeds. it appears that this gene plays the major role in producing the very high levels of linoleic acid present in seed storage oils of the wild-type  safflower. fad2- <dig>  the presumed house-keeping microsomal Δ <dig> oleate desaturase has a generally constitutive expression throughout the plant. it is interesting to note that in this study we have found that ctfad2- <dig> has significantly higher expressioin in cotyledonary tissues of a young seedling, compared to all other safflower tissues examined. although likely contributing to the overall oleate desaturase activity in safflower vegetative tissues , ctfad2- <dig> presumably plays only a secondary role in linoleic acid production in the seed oil.

the expression of ctfad2- <dig> in yeast led to the specific synthesis of palmitolinoleic acid , presumably produced by the desaturation of palmitoleic acid. it is well established that the initial desaturation of a c <dig> saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid occurs in the plastids by the action of the stearoyl-acp Δ9-desaturase to form palmitoleic acid that could be exported to the cytosol and incorporated into phospholipids for further desaturation by a fad <dig> oleate Δ12-desaturase  <cit> . to our knowledge, the safflower ctfad2- <dig> is the first described fad <dig> enzyme specific for the production of palmitolinoleic acid. palmitolinoleic acid does not normally accumulate in abundance in plant tissues as it is quickly converted to hexadecatrienoic acid  by abundant Δ15-desaturase in vegetative tissues, and in seed tissue there is limited availability of c16: <dig> substrate. in olive leaves and mesocarp tissues, increased accumulation of palmitolinoleic acid was observed in respond to wounding  <cit> . it was suggested that the increase of palmitolinoleic acid in wounded olive mesocarp is a result of enhanced demand for substrates for the synthesis in the chloroplast of hexadecatrienoic acid that could be used as precursors via the lipoxygenase pathway of signal molecules involved in plant defence and wounding  <cit> . however, the involvement of c <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids in the oxylipin biosynthesis is less documented compared to its c <dig> counterparts. it remains to be revealed what the specific evolutionary drive is for ctfad2- <dig> that specifically produces palmitolinoleic acid in safflower.

among the  <dig> safflower ctfad <dig> genes, ctfad2- <dig> is the first characterised fad <dig> gene with preferential expression in safflower heads prior to seed set. however this is similar to the situation in cotton where of the four different genes encoding fad <dig> isolated one member, ghfad2- <dig>  was specifically expressed in both developing flower buds and seeds  <cit> . it is known that jasmonic acid derived from ala plays a significant role as a chemical signal controlling stamen and pollen development, especially in the final stages of pollen development and anther dehiscence in arabidopsis  <cit> . as the precursor of ala, therefore, the enhanced production of linoleic acid by fad <dig> may play an essential role in flower development. it is likely that the retention of ctfad2- <dig> as a strong Δ12-desaturase for synthesis of seed storage lipids has freed up the duplicated ctfad2- <dig> for diversification into a specialised flower-specific form. evolutionary modifications of the ctfad2- <dig> gene that favoured flower expression at the expense of seed expression would be unlikely to have any negative fitness consequences given the retention of ctfad2- <dig> seed expression and the relatively inconsequential impact that moderate variations in oleic-linoleic ratios in seed lipids would be expected to have on fitness.

we demonstrated that the ctfad2- <dig> Δ <dig> acetylenase is a tri-functional enzyme that could desaturate both oleate and linoleate. it produces a mixture of Δ <dig> and  isomers of c18: <dig> from oleate in yeast cells. in plant cells, ctfad2- <dig> could also produce crepenynic acid ,-octadecen-12-ynoate) from linoleate, as demonstrated by transient expression in a n. benthamiana leaf. such a multi-functionality has previously been reported in crepis alpina where crep <dig> could produce both cis and trans isomers of c18: <dig> fatty acid, in addition to producing crepenynic acid in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . when expressed in yeast, ctfad2- <dig> produces a higher level of c18:2Δ <dig>  than linoleic acid, consistent with the expression of crep <dig> in arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . c18:2Δ <dig>  has been identified as an apparent metabolic dead end as it cannot be converted further into crepenynic acid. the cis and trans fad2-mediated Δ <dig> oleate desaturation likely have very similar catalytic mechanisms but differ in substrate binding properties. compared to a normal fad <dig> oleate cis-Δ <dig> desaturase, ctfad2- <dig> might have an altered substrate interaction geometry at the active site. a less restrictive binding pocket could allow a small rotation of the substrate and permit the formation of an e/z mixture. it was previously demonstrated that a c18:2Δ <dig>  is produced by abstraction of the pro-r hydrogens at c <dig> and c <dig>  whereas and c18:2Δ <dig>  is produced by scission of the  hydrogens  <cit> .

it appears that the Δ <dig> trans-double bond is a co-product of acetylenic fatty acid production by a specialised fad <dig> enzyme in both safflower and crepis. the trans desaturation of oleate to form c18:2Δ <dig>  has also been shown by another functionally divergent fad <dig> enzyme, the Δ <dig> fatty acid conjugase from tung , which displayed trans-Δ <dig> oleic acid desaturase activity, in addition to its conjugase activity  <cit> . the production of a trans double bond, accompanied by the production of other unusual fatty acids, such as calendic acid , <dig> ) in calendula, and dimorphecolic acid ,12) in dimorphotheca sinuate by divergent fad <dig> fatty acid modifying enzymes has also been reported  <cit> .

in the transient expression system of n. benthamiana leaves, we have observed that the expression of ctfad2- <dig> resulted in an increase in the relative proportions of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids at the expense of polyunsaturated fatty acids. this is consistent with what has previously been observed in the expression of acetylenases and epoxygenases in arabidopsis and cotton  <cit> . the production of vernolic acid, by modest seed-specific expression of the c. palaestina Δ12-epoxygenase  gene in arabidopsis and cotton seeds led to enhanced oleic acid accumulation at the expense of linoleic acid compared to the wild type seeds. the subsequent co-expression of c. palaestina Δ <dig> desaturase  with cpal <dig> was shown to restore the normal oleate desaturation and therefore further raised the vernolic acid level. this highlights that substrate availability is one factor controlling diverged fad <dig> desaturase activity. potential alternative mechanisms for the reduced levels of linoleic acid in n. benthamiana leaves expressing the ctfad2- <dig> gene could include a degree of homology-based post-transcriptional silencing of Δ12-desaturase members of the fad <dig> gene family that are operational in the leaf, or the possible formation of potentially ineffective heterodimers between ctfad2- <dig> and the fad <dig> Δ12-desaturase proteins  <cit> .

based on sequence alignments ctfad2- <dig> is most closely related to the sunflower vfad <dig> that is characterized as a fungal elicitor-inducible Δ <dig> fatty acid acetylenase and could produce both crepenynate and -dehydrocrepenynate when expressed in developing soybean somatic embryos  <cit> . divergent fad <dig> genes with the same catalytic functionality as the sunflower vfad <dig> have also been isolated from numerous plant species, including the eil <dig> from parsley , c. officinalis and english ivy   <cit> . although sharing higher sequence homology to vfad <dig> than c. alpina crep <dig>  when expressed in n. benthamiana ctfad2- <dig> was shown to have the same functionality as crep <dig>  it did not have the additional synthesis of -dehydrocrepenynic acid typical of the vfad2-like genes.

accumulation of acetylenic fatty acids or any other unusual fatty acids that would be synthesized by divergent forms of fad <dig> enzymes was not observed in various tissues of safflower, consistent with previous findings with c. alpina and h. annuus flower tissue even though gene expression was detected  <cit> . identifying the function and control mechanisms of such cryptic expression of unusual fatty acids is a poorly explored aspect of fatty acid metabolism. it is likely that acetylenic fatty acids are synthesized in low amounts and are rapidly metabolized for the formation of secondary bioactive molecules. crepenynic and dehydrocrepenynic acids are believed to be intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway of biologically active polyacetylenic compounds that are known to occur in safflower as well as some other members of the asteraceae, apiaceae, and araliaceae families  <cit> . however, many of the genes necessary for the formation of the putative antifungal polyacetylenes need to be discovered and the in vivo functions of functionally divergent fad <dig> in the polyacetylene pathway remain to be established.

in addition to the above mentioned safflower fad <dig> genes, another six ctfad <dig> genes, from ctfad2- <dig> through to ctfad2- <dig>  are highly expressed in rapidly expanding tissues such as cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots in the young safflower seedlings. it is not apparent why multiple fad <dig> genes would be expressed in young seedling tissues in safflower, although enhanced fad <dig> expression and increased linoleic acid production was previously observed in sunflower cotyledons immediately upon germination  <cit> . however, these ctfad <dig> genes are possibly more likely to be performing reactions other than oleate desaturases, considering that their primary sequence features are more closely associated with functionally divergent fad <dig> homologs and they were unable to synthesise linoleic acid when expressed in yeast.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification and initial characterization of the  <dig> full length fad <dig> cdnas and their corresponding structural genes provides an insight into the principal determinants of synthesis of linoleic acid in safflower seed oil. it also presents an unprecedented opportunity to fully understand the fundamental functions and diversity of fad <dig> proteins and their differing fatty acid modifications within a single plant species. characterization of the biochemical properties of each fad <dig> gene will lend further insight into their potential roles. identifying the specific structural attributes of the diverged fad <dig> enzymes that control their regio- and chemo- selectivity would be greatly accelerated by availability of a structure-function characterization of the microsomal fatty acid desaturases, an elusive goal that would have a wide ranging impact on lipid metabolic research. defining the phenotype of transgenic plants with rnai down regulation of each fad <dig> gene will contribute to the clarification of the pathways attributed by fad <dig> members. ultimately, the use of divergent fad <dig> enzymes to produce novel fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, in genetically engineered crop plants may not only provide opportunities for protection from disease or pests to the plant but also allow for the synthesis of economically valuable oleochemical products.
