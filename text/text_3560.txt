BACKGROUND
the ntf2-like superfamily is a large group of related proteins that share a common fold, first observed in the structure of the rat ntf <dig>  protein  <cit> . it is a versatile fold that can accommodate very different sequences and has no characteristic sequence motif associated with it. the ntf2-like fold has a cone-like shape with a cavity inside and acts as a molecular container that can be adapted to serve a broad range of different functions.

the ntf2-like proteins can be broadly defined into two functional categories: enzymatically active and non-enzymatically active proteins. the intracellular examples of this fold include most of the enzymatic functions associated with these proteins. these include snoal polyketide cyclase, scytalone dehydratase, limonene- <dig> -epoxide hydrolase and δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase  <cit> . the extracellular ntf2-like proteins tend to be non-enzymatic and possess small molecule binding activity. non-enzymatic members of this superfamily include ntf <dig>  <cit> , a domain found at the c-terminus of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii which is responsible for the multimerization of these kinases  <cit>  and mba <dig>  a protein which binds to ribosomes and may function as a receptor  <cit> . ntf2-like domains have been found in proteins involved in bacterial conjugation where a multiprotein complex, the type iv secretion system, mediates transfer of plasmid dna from a donor to a recipient bacterial cell  <cit> . more recently the non-catalytic ntf2-like domains have also been shown to function as immunity proteins in the bacterial polymorphic toxin systems  <cit> .

release  <dig>  of the pfam database  <cit>  includes  <dig> different families as part of the ntf <dig> superfamily. of these families,  <dig> have at least one representative where the three-dimensional structure has been deposited in the pdb. to date, the pdb contains at least  <dig> structures with ntf2-like fold, including at least  <dig> structures solved by the joint center for structural genomics . here we describe the first crystal structures of three pfam families with ntf2-like folds: duf <dig>  , duf <dig>   and duf <dig>  .

RESULTS
domain descriptions
duf <dig> family  is annotated in pfam as a domain of unknown function. it is present in  <dig> different uniprotkb proteins from  <dig> different organisms. it is found exclusively in gram-negative bacteria, with the vast majority of the species it occurs in belonging to the enterobacteraceae family.  was previously annotated in pfam as a lumazine-binding domain, however this has since been found to be incorrect and so we have renamed this family as a domain of unknown function, duf <dig>  this domain is present in  <dig> different uniprotkb proteins from  <dig> different species. like duf <dig>  duf <dig> is a bacterial family, however it is found in a wider variety of bacterial species. it is found in both gram-negative bacteria  and gram-positive species . finally, duf <dig> family  is another domain of unknown function. this domain is present in  <dig> different uniprotkb proteins from  <dig> different species. it is predominantly found in firmicutes, but is also present in other phyla, including several archaeal species.

all three of these domains are of a similar length . the n-terminus of duf <dig>  contains a pair of conserved aromatic amino acids . there is a conserved aspartic acid in the middle of the domain and close to this is a conserved glutamine. a conserved tryptophan is located near the c-terminus, closely followed by two conserved hydrophobic amino acids. duf <dig>  contains a highly conserved glycine in the middle of the domain and two conserved hydrophobic amino acids near the c-terminus. duf <dig>  contains a conserved glycine about  <dig> amino acids into the domain and a conserved tryptophan near the c-terminus.

domain architectures
in pfam,  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins  containing duf <dig> also contain a duf <dig> domain at the c-terminus . given the potential significance of this observation, we performed further investigation into the taxonomic distribution of these proteins. using evolview  <cit>  we plotted a species tree containing members of the rp <dig> set of representative proteomes  <cit>  which possess proteins containing duf <dig> and/or duf <dig> . surprisingly, we found that only two of the  <dig> species in this tree possessed both domains, and therefore we conclude that the co-occurrence of these domains is not likely to be significant and is an artifact caused by the sequencing of a disproportionately large number of escherichia coli strains compared to the other species these domains are found in.

besides the apparent co-occurrence of duf <dig> and duf <dig>  the three dufs also occur in several other architectures in pfam. these can be split roughly into three categories: architectures suggestive of communication with extracellular ligand-sensing or intracellular signaling domains , solo or multi-domain secreted and lipid-anchored architectures  and fusions to c-terminal peptidase or other hydrolase domains .

in the first category , the intracellular domains to which the extrinsic duf is linked include protein kinase domains and three distinct versions of zinc ribbons, which could potentially bind nucleic acids. these architectures are comparable to other signaling proteins where extracellular ligand domains are linked to intracellular signaling domains. this category also includes fusions of the duf with the sodium pump associated oxaloacetate decarboxylase γ chain . in the third category  we observed independent fusions to metallopeptidase , duf <dig> , a beta-lactamase and an α/β hydrolase domain . in all of these cases the duf is present at the n-terminus and the hydrolase domain at the c-terminus. ntf2-like domains have been observed with α/β hydrolases before: both snoal-like domain  and duf <dig>  co-occur with α/β hydrolase domains.

genomic context
we studied the genomic context of proteins containing duf <dig>  duf <dig> and duf <dig>  in doing this we hoped to glean information about the possible function of these domains. as a result we uncovered a conserved association with duf <dig>  which in diverse gammaproteobacteria, betaprotebacteria and bacteroidetes is combined in an operon with a gene coding for a protein of the nlpc/p <dig> superfamily with a papain-like peptidase fold   <cit> . these domains are known to function as peptidases/amidases in that cleave amide/peptide linkages in the bacterial cell wall. several of these proteins additionally contain further c-terminal domains such as ef-hands, metallopeptidase family m <dig> and glycohydrolases of the lysozyme  or the chitinase class i  families. thus, domains point to catalytic activities that process both the peptide and glycosidic linkages in peptidoglycan.

the crystal structure of a duf <dig> protein, the hypothetical protein rumgna_ <dig>  from ruminococcus gnavus , was determined to  <dig>  Å resolution by mad method and was deposited to pdb as . the final model includes two molecules , six chloride ions, six sulfate ions, eight glycerol and  <dig> water molecules in the asymmetric unit. the structure is mainly composed of four helices, four turns, and five beta strands. only gly <dig>  was disordered and not modeled. all the side chains were fully modeled because of the complete electron density. the matthews coefficient  is  <dig>  Å3 da- <dig> and the estimated solvent content is  <dig> %. the ramachandran plot produced by molprobity shows that  <dig> % of the residues are in favored regions, with no outliers.

comparison of these three structures showed that they are significantly similar to each other, especially for  and . fatcat results showed that the structures of  and  are significantly similar with p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and the structure alignment has  <dig> equivalent positions with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å; the structures of  and  are significantly similar with p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and the structure alignment has  <dig> equivalent positions with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å; the structures of  and  are significantly similar with p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and the structure alignment has  <dig> equivalent positions with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å  <cit> . in all cases, fatcat program detected flexibility in the structure, mostly limited to the relative position of helices with respect to the central beta sheet. there is low sequence similarity between the three structures, and no positions are conserved in all three structures.

the three structures  all possess ntf2-like folds, despite being dissimilar in sequence . a hydrophobic cavity with the potential for ligand-binding has been described in ntf2-like proteins before  <cit> . we used the markus functional annotation server to locate potential cavities within the three structures  <cit> . all three structures contain predicted cavities, but the position of these cavities is not conserved between the structures. the structure of  differs from that of  and  in that it lacks the edge strands in the beta-sheet but has a longer helix on the opposite side. it has a shallow cavity with positive electrostatic potential that contains a bound peg molecule in the crystal structure. notably, in dimers seen in the crystal structure of  the cavities of individual subunits combine in a contiguous groove that can accommodate a larger ligand than a conventional ntf-like fold can.  has a cavity of a similar size in a similar position with weakly positive electrostatic potential. sequence conservation in the region of the cavities in  and in  is poor. in contrast, the cavity found in  has a negative electrostatic potential, this cavity includes two highly conserved aspartic acid residues  which may be of significance.

dali  <cit>  searches revealed that  and  are more similar to each other than they are to most other members of the ntf2-like superfamily , however  is more distantly related.  is most similar to   which contains a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii association domain , also a member of the ntf2-like superfamily. this domain functions as an oligomerisation domain  <cit> . it is also significantly similar to  , a member of the virb <dig> family , a component of the type iv secretion system  <cit> . it is significantly less similar to  , and  .  and  are most similar to members of the snoal_ <dig> family  including  , and the snoal_ <dig> family  including  .

potential function
ntf2-like domains include both catalytic and non-catalytic versions that tend to bind small molecules using a common substrate-binding pocket. our analysis of these dufs did not reveal conserved polar residues suggestive of catalytic activity in duf <dig> or duf <dig>  duf <dig> contains a conserved aspartic acid, which could point to a catalytic function. ntf2-like domains which are enzymatic tend to occur in an intracellular context, however prediction of subcellular localization using phobius  <cit>  revealed the consistent presence of either n-terminal secretory signals or lipoboxes with a conserved cysteine which helps anchor the protein to the membrane. those proteins that lack either of these features have transmembrane regions with predicted membrane topologies suggestive of an extracellular location for the duf . together these observations suggested that these three dufs are novel ntf2-like domains that are likely to be extracellular domains that recognize a small molecule ligand via their binding pocket.

further evidence for such a function is offered by the domain architectures of these proteins . where the duf is found at the n-terminus of oad γ chain domain the sensing of a ligand could help allosterically regulate sodium flux  <cit> . where the duf is found at the n-terminus of a protein containing a c-terminal peptidase or other hydrolase domain, it is conceivable that the sensing of a ligand by the n-terminal duf regulates the catalytic domain. similar domain architecture associations were also observed for duf <dig>  which occurs fused to duf <dig> in certain contexts: duf <dig> is also linked to metallopeptidase , protein kinase and tpr repeats and is also associated with lipid attachment signal or signal peptides or transmembrane regions. hence it is possible that the two domains perform comparable functions and cooperate in recognition of extracellular ligands on occasions. the versions combined in operons with the nlpc/p <dig> like peptidases/amidases might potentially regulate the export and/or the activity of these peptidoglycan hydrolyzing proteins that could have a potentially suicidal effect on the cell. thus, they could play a role in regulating peptidoglycan remodeling.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a comparison of first crystal structures of three dufs belonging to the ntf2-like superfamily. this work expands our structural knowledge of the sequence diverse ntf <dig> superfamily. analysis of the three-dimensional structure, sequence and associated domains can provide clues about the likely function of a protein domain. we present a detailed analysis of these three domains, which suggests that they may play a role in binding to small molecule ligands.
