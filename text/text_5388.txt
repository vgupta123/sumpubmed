BACKGROUND
it is known that inherited genomic cnv is linked to risk for human disease and response to treatment. it has also been established for decades that genomic variation, including cnv in germline dna, can help predict variation in efficacy and/or adverse responses to therapeutic drugs  <cit> . for example, individuals with multiple copies of the gene encoding the drug metabolizing enzyme cyp2d <dig> are "ultrarapid" metabolizers as compared to those with cyp2d <dig> deletions , and these genotypes are associated with variation in response to a large number of drugs  <cit> . cnvs within the human genome are not rare events. redon et. al.  <cit>  identified nearly  <dig>  cnv regions scattered throughout the genome in  <dig> hapmap samples. those regions comprised approximately 10% of the human genome, encompassing coding and non-coding regions, as compared to the < 1% of the genome that is occupied by snps  <cit> . cnvs appear to be present at lower frequencies than snps  <cit> , but this may be due in part to the techniques utilized to identify them. thus, the prevalence and biological significance of cnvs may be underestimated. as of early  <dig>  nearly  <dig>  cnv loci had been cataloged by the database of genomic variants http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/. in addition, nearly 18% of mrna species that are genetically regulated through cis effects could be explained by cnvs  <cit> . together with snp genotypes, cnv data can be generated with snp arrays  <cit> . although these methodologies have limitations  <cit> , cnvs, depending on their size and location, may be just as important for variation in function as are snps.

the cytidine analogues, gemcitabine and arac, show significant therapeutic effect in several types of cancer. gemcitabine is mainly used to treat solid tumors  <cit>  while arac is used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia  <cit> . clinical response to these two drugs varies widely, and previous studies showed that inheritance can contribute to the variation in response of these two drugs  <cit> . in this study, we set out to test the hypothesis that cnv might contribute to variation in gemcitabine and arac response in  <dig> ebv transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines using snp data obtained with illumina  <dig> and  <dig> k snp arrays.

methods
genotyping and populations
a subset of the "human variation panel" lymphoblastoid cell lines consisting of  <dig> caucasian-american ,  <dig> african-american , and  <dig> han chinese-american , as well as  <dig> ceph caucasian hapmap ebv transformed cell lines was obtained from the coriell cell repository . these cell lines had been obtained from healthy individuals and were anonymized by the national institute of general medical sciences prior to deposit. all of these individuals had provided written consent for the use of their cells and dna from those cells to be used for experimental purposes. we genotyped the aa dna from these cell lines using the illumina human hap  <dig> beadchip , and the illumina human hap  <dig> beadchips were used to genotype the remainder of the samples. all samples were genotyped in the mayo clinic genotyping core facility. all but two samples had a call rate greater than 98%, and those two samples, even after repetition, had call rates between  <dig> and 98%. we assessed lrr standard deviation  for our samples and found that none of the samples had a sd less than  <dig> . quality control  recommendations for the penncnv or quantisnp algorithms suggest using a sd <  <dig>   <cit> . since, our lrr standard deviation did not exceed this qc threshold; we also used those two samples in the analysis. for consistency, we did not include the additional  <dig> k snps genotyped for the aa samples in the cnv analysis.

copy number identification
bead studio version  <dig>  was used to obtain log r ratios and b allele frequencies for  <dig>  snps in the  <dig> samples studied. logr ratios were generated by comparing our experimental logr values to bead studio's built in multi-ethnic hapmap population. cnv genotyping was performed using an objective bayes hidden-markov model   <cit>  plug-in within illumina's bead studio interface. quantisnp is a statistical algorithm that utilizes joint information with regard to log r ratios and b allele frequencies for quantitative snp array data analysis that allows for precise discovery and mapping of copy number changes. we used the quantisnp parameters recommended by illumina: expectation maximization =  <dig>  cnv length =  <dig> , maximum copy number returned =  <dig>  no gc content normalization, and score threshold =  <dig>  after applying the quantisnp algorithm, we exported the cnv values and confidence values for each snp out of the bead studio software. using our own in-house programs written in r and perl, we then separated all snps associated with cnvs that were observed in two or more samples . these thresholds and parameters were set conservatively to accurately identify cnvs under these conditions. this approach should reduce the false positive rate, but at the risk of increasing the false negative rate and missing more common, yet smaller cnvs that are inherently more difficult to detect. after transforming cnv values for each snp into deletion , normal  or amplification , distinct copy number regions were obtained by merging neighboring snps with identical cnvs across samples. a detailed description of the methods used is available in the additional file  <dig> methods section.

copy number validation
eleven copy number regions found to be associated with gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> values  were selected for validation using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification . oligonucleotides were preferentially designed based on a successful assay, followed by selection for coding sequences and underlying p-values. m <dig> sequence was attached to each probe together with a complementary flexmap <dig> sequence . specifically,  <dig> ng of dna was denatured at 98°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by 25°c for  <dig> minute. in an  <dig> μl reaction,  <dig> ng of dna and  <dig>  femtomole/μl of each probe were mixed with  <dig>  μl of mlpa buffer . probes were allowed to hybridize at 60°c for 16- <dig> hours. probes were ligated in a reaction containing  <dig> μl h2o,  <dig> μl ligase- <dig> buffer a and b , and  <dig> μl ligase- <dig>  at 54°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by 98°c for  <dig> minutes. each  <dig> μl pcr reaction consisted of  <dig> μl of ligated product mixed with  <dig>  μl h2o,  <dig> μl  <dig> × buffer ,  <dig>  μl  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> ,  <dig> μl  <dig> mm dntps ,  <dig>  μl  <dig> μm m <dig> primers, and  <dig> μl platinum taq .  <dig> μl of pcr product was then added to  <dig> μl of bead mix containing  <dig>  beads for each flexmap microsphere  suspended in  <dig> × tmac, and the mixture was incubated at 96°c for  <dig> minutes, followed by 37°c for  <dig> minutes. following incubation,  <dig>  μl of streptavidin r-phycoerythrin conjugate  plus  <dig> μl of  <dig> × tmac was added and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. samples were assayed on a liquichip 100is system  and results were analyzed with genemarker  <dig>  software. of the  <dig> cnv assayed, one , did not provide adequate signal intensity for analysis.

mts assay
arac was purchased from sigma-aldrich  and gemcitabine was provided by eli lilly . cytotoxicity assays were performed with the celltiter 96® aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay . the drug concentrations used to perform these experiments were described in detail previously by li et al.,  <dig>  <cit> .

statistical analysis
the cytotoxicity phenotype  was determined on the basis of the best fitting curve, either  <dig> parameter logistic,  <dig> parameter logistic with top = 100%, or  <dig> parameter logistic with bottom = 0%. the curves were constructed using the dose response curves package in r. the logistic model with the lowest mean square error was used to determine ic <dig> values for gemcitabine and arac as described in li et al.  <cit> . drug response phenotypes  for both drugs were adjusted for ethnicity, gender and storage time of the  <dig> samples using linear regression . in addition, cnv values were adjusted for ethnicity and gender. linear regression was then used to perform association with adjusted cnv values  with adjusted ic <dig> phenotypes . p-values for association were obtained after performing  <dig> permutations for both gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> values.

transient transfection and rna interference
human miapaca- <dig> pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with sirna using lipofectamine rnamax . specifically, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and were mixed with sirna-complex containing  <dig> nm specific or negative control sirna  and transfection reagent  in opti-mem® i reduced serum media . forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested for cell-based assays. smyd <dig> sirna and negative control sirna were purchased from qiagen and were used as suggested by the manufacturer.

sequences for sirna against smyd <dig> were: sense strand: ggc gau cau aag cag caa udtdt cga uua uaa uaa auu caa cdtdt

antisense strand: auu gcu gcu uau gau cgc cdtdt uuu gaa uuu auu aua auc gdtdg

sequences for negative control sirna were:

sense strand: uuc ucc gaa cgu guc acg udtdt

antisense strand: acg uga cac guu cgg aga adtdt

real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr
total rna was isolated from cultured cells with the qiagen rneasy kit , followed by qrt-pcr performed with the 1-step, brilliant ii sybr green qrt-pcr master mix kit . specifically, primers purchased from qiagen were used to perform qrt-pcr using the stratagene mx3005p™ real-time pcr detection system . all experiments were performed in triplicate with β-actin as an internal control. control reactions lacked rna template.

RESULTS
cnv identification
we used the quantisnp parameters recommended by illumina for copy number identification. the quantisnp algorithm in illumina provided cnv values and confidence values for each snp and sample. after pre-processing the data, we had  <dig>  snps with cnv values other than "normal" .  <dig>  snps were retained in the analysis after excluding snps that did not display variation in at least two samples . we then applied a simple segregation algorithm as described in additional file  <dig> methods and identified  <dig> cnvs at  <dig> loci using the  <dig> dna samples obtained from  <dig> ethnic groups. figure  <dig> shows the cnv call results using cnv region display in bead studio software for  <dig> samples selected randomly from among the  <dig> samples assayed. from the randomly selected data displayed in figure  <dig>  it is clear that specific cnv regions could be associated with multiple dna samples. copy number loci or regions can also have multiple forms of variation, probably as a result of different breakpoints. the mean and median cnv frequencies per sample were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, with a maximum value of  <dig>  the  <dig> cnv loci identified represented  <dig>  mb of sequence, with an average length of  <dig> kb and a median of  <dig> kb  . twenty five cnvs identified in this study were observed in all three ethnic groups;  <dig> cnvs were found in  <dig> ethnicities; and  <dig> cnvs were observed in only one ethnic group . no loci below 1% copy number frequency were reported in this study.

we compared our loci to those in the structural variation table in the university of california santa cruz's  database http://genome.ucsc.edu. figure  <dig> shows an example on chromosome  <dig>  eighty-seven of the  <dig> loci that we identified overlapped with previously characterized cnvs, and 51/ <dig> had been identified in more than one study. of the  <dig> loci that had not been characterized previously, no obvious differences in size or prevalence were observed, suggesting that these are likely to be true cnvs and not the result of systematic error. in figure  <dig> we have superimposed our cnv values for a portion of chromosome  <dig> over ucsc database data. divergence from the baseline indicates regions of cnv, while amplitude represents prevalence. figure  <dig> represents the overlap of our data  at the top with previous reports at the bottom  <cit> . lack of technical bias between illumina  <dig> k and  <dig> k data is also shown since only the overlapping snp set for the two platforms was used .

we also had affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  expression array data for the same  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell lines in which we assayed cnv  <cit> , which made it possible for us to quantify the expression of genes linked to cnvs. forty one expression array probesets mapped close to  or within the  <dig> cnv regions that we identified. of those  <dig> probesets, only  <dig> were expressed  when compared to the 28% of the  <dig>  probesets across the entire genome that were expressed) in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, with an average expression value above "100" using gcrma normalization data .

gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> value associations with cnvs
to identify gene that might contribute to variation in cytidine analog-induced cytotoxicity, we next analyzed associations between cnvs and ic <dig> values for gemcitabine and arac. we had previously performed gemcitabine and arac cytotoxicity studies using the same cell lines, as described previously  <cit> . ic <dig> values for both drugs were used as phenotypes for the association studies, and the analysis was adjusted for race and gender. the association studies with gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> value phenotypes resulted in the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> cnv regions, respectively, that showed associations with p-values <  <dig>  after  <dig> permutations. although these two drugs are similar in structure, we did not observe any common cnv regions that were significantly associated with ic <dig> values for both gemcitabine and arac. the annotation and association results for gemcitabine and arac are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

cnv validation using mlpa
to experimentally validate cnvs that were significantly associated with drug cytotoxicity, we tested the  <dig> cnvs with permutated p-values for association that were less than  <dig>  using a high-throughput method designed to quantify genomic content, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification . we were unable to amplify one cnv . when we compared mlpa to cnv values on a per-sample basis, 173/ <dig> samples matched our original quantisnp cnv calls. therefore, our original analysis had a zero false positive rate for all but two regions , and the false negative rates ranged from 0% to 65% for the  <dig> regions that could be amplified . the chr2cnv <dig> cnv, as shown in table s <dig>  had an exceptionally high false negative rate, and we cannot rule out the possibility that a snp beneath the mlpa probe might be responsible.

functional characterization
to further characterize cnv regions, we identified genes within  <dig> kb of the  <dig> regions that were associated with gemcitabine or arac ic <dig> values. this relatively large region was chosen because previous studies have shown that cis-acting regulators can act over megabase distances  <cit> . two of the  <dig> regions that were significantly associated with gemcitabine cytotoxicity contained a gene within  <dig> kb of the cnv. both regions were on chromosome  <dig>  one chromosome  <dig> region, 134154053- <dig>  had  <dig> snps associated with the cnv. the nearest gene, b3gat <dig>  was  <dig> bp distant from the cnv . the second chromosome  <dig> region, 5858528- <dig>  had  <dig> snps associated with the cnv and the or52e <dig> gene overlapped this region.

in the case of arac, one region  associated with arac cytotoxicity was located on chromosome  <dig>  with the nearest gene lrp5l , more than  <dig> bases distant. genes associated with chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> regions were nphp <dig> , plekha <dig>  and gpr <dig> , respectively. nphp <dig> and plekha <dig> overlapped the cnv regions, whereas gpr <dig> was  <dig> kb away from the cnv region associated with arac. the region located on chromosome  <dig> overlapped the kif26b gene and was  <dig> kb away from a gene encoding a histone methyltransferase, smyd <dig> 

association of cnv regions with the arac phenotype.

since we had affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  mrna expression array data for the same lymphoblastoid cell lines in which we had assayed cnv  <cit> ; we determined average expression levels for all genes associated with the cnvs. although there were no probesets associated with ore52e <dig>  we found that the average mrna expression levels after gcrma normalization for probesets linked with b3gat <dig>  tyrp <dig>  fam5c, adam <dig>  lrp5l, plekha <dig>  kif26b, nphp <dig>  flj <dig>  and gpr <dig> were less than  <dig>  suggesting either low or no expression of these genes in lymphoblastoid cells. therefore, no further analysis was conducted with these candidates. however, one of the genes associated with arac ic <dig> had an average expression of  <dig>  in our cell lines and the expression of this gene was also associated with arac ic <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig> . the chr1cnv <dig> association did not pass bonferroni correction. however, the association study was a "discovery" study - to be followed by functional genomics validation. hence, we selected the smyd <dig> candidate gene based on expression and possible biological relevance to cancer.

smyd <dig> functional validation
it is known that knockdown of smyd <dig> inhibits cervical carcinoma cell growth and invasion  <cit>  and that mutations in the 5'-flanking region of smyd <dig> may represent a risk factor for human cancer  <cit> . it is also known that smyd <dig> plays crucial roles in hela cell proliferation and migration/invasion, so it has been suggested that it may be a useful therapeutic target in human cervical carcinomas  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  a cnv region located on chromosome  <dig> close to the smyd <dig> gene  is associated with arac ic <dig> value, with a permutation p-value of  <dig> . the chr1cnv <dig> deletion occurred in  <dig> samples, all from caucasian subjects, so we also tested the association in only this ethnic group. likelihood ratio testing of linear regression of arac log ic <dig> values against gender and storage time, with or without the relevant cnv values, gave a p-value of  <dig> . in addition, analysis of ic <dig> values with the chr1cnv <dig> region showed that deletion of this cnv region was associated with an increase in the ic <dig> value for arac . to confirm results obtained from the association study, we also performed specific sirna knockdown of the smyd <dig> gene in human miapaca- <dig> pancreatic cancer cells, followed by cytotoxicity studies. down regulation of smyd <dig> mrna by sirna desensitized the pancreatic cancer cells to arac  when compared with cells transfected with negative control sirna , a directional change consistent with the results of our cnv association study. although, smyd <dig> did not show a significant association with gemcitabine cytotoxicity during the association study, we also performed functional studies with that drug. we found that knockdown of the smyd <dig> gene also made miapaca- <dig> cells more resistant to gemcitabine  as shown in figure  <dig>  the chr1cnv <dig> copy number was associated with gemcitabine ic <dig> values, . while the p-value of association was insignificant, the directionality of the association was consistent with the results of the knockdown studies. in summary, knockdown of smyd <dig>  followed by cytotoxicity studies with both drugs, showed significant deviations, but the deviation was small for arac when compared to that after gemcitabine treatment .

summary of ic <dig> values for copy number =  <dig> and copy number =  <dig> 

finally, since the cnv close to the smyd <dig> gene was significantly associated with ic <dig>  and since the functional validation studies of smyd <dig> agreed with the association study results, we expected that variation of mrna expression for smyd <dig> in the cell lines might be significantly correlated with ic <dig>  smyd <dig> mrna expression was significantly associated with ic <dig> value, with a p-value of  <dig> .

discussion
cnv can occur as a result of genomic rearrangements like deletion, duplication, inversion, and translocation. features such as the presence of repetitive elements, size of the sequences, gc content, similarity and distance between the sequences play a critical role in determining susceptibility of regions to these rearrangement events  <cit> . many methods have been used successfully to identify cnv regions across the genome. the high density of data from snp platforms such as those of supplied by illumina or affymetrix has not only allowed us to perform genome-wide association studies to identify genotypes that are associated with a phenotype, but have also made it possible to quantify snp alleles  for cnv. these log r ratios and b allele frequencies can be used to discover cnv by applying computational algorithms. however, despite advances in computational methods, the identification of intermediate sized cnvs  remains a challenge; since detection of cnvs is based on the density and spacing of probes on the platform.

in this study, we have used  <dig>  snp markers  to discover cnv in  <dig> human lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from ethnically diverse populations. the average distance between markers on the illumina  <dig> k chip is  <dig>  kb, and the average size of cnvs identified in our cell lines was more than  <dig>  bp, indicating that smaller cnv may be underrepresented in our study. the illumina  <dig> k snp chip was designed, in part, to interrogate gene rich regions  <cit> ; which is an advantage with regard to a lower probability of our missing a gene-related cnv. we identified  <dig> cnvs in  <dig> regions with minor allele frequencies > 1% . variables such as array, coverage, intensity and cnv calling algorithms may all give different cnv calls. therefore, we used previous copy number findings represented in the structural variation table in the ucsc database http://genome.ucsc.edu to compare with our cnvs and found that the vast majority of variant loci  were found in other publications, and 51/ <dig> were represented in multiple studies. although we did find agreement for many of our cnvs with previously reported variants, there were other cnv regions previously reported that were not identified in our study. this could be due to our stringent criteria for cnvs. it also could be due to the different platforms, methods and study populations used in different studies. in addition rare events are usually not reported.

it is known that variation in response to chemotherapy results from many factors, including gender, race, environmental factors and dna sequence variation. dna sequence variation may include both snps and cnv. therefore, the presence of cnv is an important factor that may contribute to variation in response to chemotherapy. specifically, the existence of cnv within or near a gene might result in differences in mrna and protein expression. to identify possible pharmacogenomic candidate genes that might be affected by cnv, we tested the association of cnv with a drug response phenotype  for gemcitabine and arac using a  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell line-based model system designed to make it possible to study common human genetic variation. although tumor genome is critical for understanding response to therapy and disease pathophysiology, the germline genome is also critical, especially for drug response phenotypes. obviously, we understand that these lymphoblastoid cell lines were ebv transformed from normal individuals, and that they were neither collected from cancer patients nor tumor tissues. hence, we might miss some candidate genes that may be specific to cancer. however, lymphoblastoid cell lines have been shown by several groups, including ours, to be useful for identifying candidate genes or genetic variation associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity  <cit> . therefore, in this study we also used these lymphoblastoid cell lines to study the possible contribution of cnvs to variation in drug response. to begin the process of understanding how variation in copy number might affect drug response phenotypes for gemcitabine and arac, we correlated  <dig> cnvs with ic <dig> values in  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell lines. 11/ <dig> regions were associated with gemcitabine and arac ic <dig> values . we then performed mlpa to compare with and to validate the in-silico quantisnp cnv calls.

since we had affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  expression array data for the same lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> ; we determined expression levels for genes surrounding the  <dig> cnv regions. the b3gat <dig>  lrp5l, plekha <dig>  kif26b, nphp <dig>  tyrp <dig>  fam5c, adam <dig>  flj <dig>  and gpr <dig> genes had low expression. only one cnv on chromosome  <dig>  had a gene  in close proximity that displayed high expression in the lymphoblastoid cell lines.

smyd <dig>  found on the q arm of chromosome  <dig>  encodes an alternatively spliced transcript for  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids protein. hamamoto et. al. first described smyd3's histone methyltransferase activity with specificity for di- and tri- methylation of lys <dig> on histone  <dig>  smyd3's histone methyltransferase activity results in transcription induction for at least  <dig> targets across the genome  <cit> . enhanced expression of smyd <dig> has been observed in numerous tumors including colorectal, hepatocellular  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . overexpression experiments of smyd <dig> have repeatedly shown to increase the rate of cell proliferation  <cit> , while knockdown experiments result in decrease cell proliferation and cell migration while increasing apoptosis  <cit> . our studies indicated the association of the chr1cnv <dig> with arac cytotoxicity as well as correlation with smyd <dig> expression. functional validations of our results were performed with knockdown of the smyd <dig> gene in pancreatic cancer cell lines. knockdown made the cells more resistant to arac, confirming the association study results, and also made them resistant to gemcitabine. our results suggest that joining association studies with functional validation experiments may help to identify biomarkers for disease or response to therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
we took the advantage of genome-wide snp data obtained with  <dig> k illumina bead chips to identify cnv regions across the genome in  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell lines. association studies with gemcitabine and arac cytotoxicity phenotypes identified cnv regions that might be associated with cytotoxicity for these two drugs. in this study we investigated the role of cnvs together with expression of neighboring genes  with drug response phenotypes. analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines and functional validation in cancer cell lines suggest the probable role of smyd <dig> to arac and gemcitabine drug response phenotype. the current study provides additional information with regard to the contribution of cnvs to variation in drug response for two important antineoplastic drugs and indicates that the assay of cnv should be included in pharmacogenomic studies.
