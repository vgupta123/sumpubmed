BACKGROUND
endocrine therapy is a highly effective form of adjuvant therapy for hormone sensitive breast cancer. currently, the three classes of commonly used drugs for adjuvant endocrine therapy are selective estrogen receptor modulators , selective estrogen receptor down-regulators , and aromatase inhibitors . unfortunately, tumor cells often develop resistance to endocrine therapy  <cit> , representing a major obstacle limiting the success of breast cancer treatment. to better understand the biology and molecular mechanisms that underlie endocrine resistance, we and others have developed tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cell models  <cit> . we demonstrated that dramatically different molecular mechanisms underlie progression to resistance to tamoxifen  and fulvestrant  and also identified specific genes and biochemical pathways associated with serm- and serd-resistance.

recently, micrornas , a novel noncoding rna class  <cit> , have been shown to be key regulators of various biological processes and diseases  <cit> . in breast cancer, alterations in expression of mirnas appear to play important roles in drug resistance  <cit>  and thus may represent new therapeutic targets. furthermore, the role of specific mirnas in antiestrogen  resistant breast cancer has been investigated by us  <cit>  and others  <cit> , and both rao et al.  <cit>  and miller et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a critical role for mir-221/ <dig> in serm and serd resistances as well as a key role in estrogen receptor alpha  biology and function. in this follow-up study, we took a global approach to further investigate the role of mirnas in resistance to these important endocrine therapies.

although methods for the functional analysis of mirnas are publicly available  <cit> , systematic global view  <cit>  of the networks of these key epigenetic regulators has not been fully explored. systems biology  <cit>  approaches have recently been used to examine mirna-mediated pathogenic dys-regulation  <cit>  and oestrogen-regulated mirnas  <cit> ; however, this approach has only recently been used to investigate breast cancer drug resistance  <cit> , one of the most lethal cancers in women. here, we present an integrative view of “antiestrogen resistance-related mirna-mrna regulation” and discuss functional roles of this previously un-described network. the network was reconstructed by combining cancer contexts and expression profiles for mirnas and mrnas. furthermore, in order to minimize false positives in the network construction  <cit> , we utilized experimental evidence-based prior knowledge databases  <cit> , including mirna-target mrna relations and mirna upstream regulators  in mirna promoters). the use of cancer contexts  <cit>  provided further biological interpretability for the network construction. to simplify the network, we determined the underlying substructures . notably, in addition to the known mir-221/222-mediated network cluster  <cit> , we identified novel mirna-related network clusters associated with antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer  <cit> . interestingly, the novel network clusters contained genomic instability, a recently described hallmark of cancer  <cit>  and area of intense interest in the breast cancer field  <cit> .

RESULTS
overview
our goal was to identify a global mirna-regulated landscape in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines  compared to mcf <dig> . to improve the reliability of our approach, experimentally validated mirna-related databases were used to construct an “evidence-based” mirna-mrna network. the network consisted of mirnas, their targets, transcription factors  binding to mirna promoters, and signaling molecules upstream of mirnas. we further expanded the network by associating it with biological contexts, including the important hallmarks of cancer   <cit> . the associations were inspected by utilizing a text-mining tool, pubgene  <cit> . subsequently, the expression data for both mirnas and mrnas  <cit>  were incorporated into the network. in order to observe differential usage  of the fully integrative network, we examined two different drug resistance states  and then refine topologically important network clusters underscoring the network. the details are described in methods.

integrative network description
the integrative network  demonstrated that the entries  were extensively interconnected with eight cancer-related hallmarks  <cit> , suggesting that mirna-driven epigenetic changes in these hallmarks  <cit>  contributed to the resistance of mcf <dig> cells to antiestrogens. furthermore, both common and differential network usages were observed between the two drug resistance states. to validate the network regulations , we used the mean correlation across all the edges  as a statistic  <cit>  and performed  <dig> node label permutations. as a result, the regulations or the associations in the network were statistically significant at p-value  <dig>  .

network cluster analysis
to further identify important network clusters associated with tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistance, we dissected the integrative network by using a cytoscape  <cit>  plug-in, clustermaker  <cit> . this analysis resulted in  <dig> non-orphan network clusters. we then selected the top  <dig> largest clusters having at least five elements . as cluster  <dig> showed the strong associations with cancer hallmarks, we examined this cluster in greater detail .

cluster  <dig> contained both differential and common usages by mirnas and their targets. the mirnas and mrnas relating to the two drug resistant states were associated specifically with various cancer contexts , drug resistance neoplasm, glycolysis, receptors cytokine)  <cit> . mir-146a was down-regulated in both drug resistant cell lines, and its targets, brca1/ <dig>  were up-regulated in the cluster. mir-146a is considered to function as a tumor suppressor  <cit>  in a tissue-dependent context  <cit> , while brca1/ <dig> are well known tumor suppressors involved in maintaining genome-integrity, cell cycle, and dna damage response   <cit> . despite up-regulation of these tumor suppressor genes , which would contribute to increased genome stability, it is possible that tsg binding partners could negatively affect genome maintenance  <cit> . therefore, we examined expression changes of brca1/ <dig> partners in the two resistant cells compared to mcf <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  expression of brca1/ <dig> binding partners was deregulated  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  proposed that excess of error-free homologous recombination , a critical process for maintaining genomic integrity, can result in genomic instability and that fine-tuning may be coordinated in the ddr pathway, dna repair, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle control. thus, during development of resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, brca1/ <dig> binding partner expression changes may be detrimental not only to cell cycle checkpoint  <cit>  but also to the ddr pathway, an important pathway in genomic stability  <cit> . although tsgs brca <dig> and brca <dig> were up-regulated in mcf7-f and mcf7-t compared to the parental mcf <dig> cell line, brca1/ <dig> up-regulation may affect fine-tuning of genomic integrity  <cit> .

as mutations are also known to be critical for drug resistance  <cit> , we examined publicly known somatic mutations associated with cluster  <dig>  somatic mutation of pik3ca in mcf <dig> has been reported in the cosmic database   <cit>  and recent studies  <cit>  have reported an association between pik3ca mutation and breast cancer drug resistance. our analysis of the two sublines indicates that pi3k/akt mutation resulting in signaling activation may contribute to the development of antiestrogen resistance. such pi3k/akt activation may also induce phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and nuclear export of chk <dig>  <cit> , resulting in genomic instability. we further speculate that pik3ca mutation in mcf <dig> cells could acquire gain-of-function  during development of antiestrogen resistance, resulting in genomic instability and contributing to the resistant phenotypes. interestingly, akt <dig> activation has been reported to cause genomic instability via nuclear localization of brca <dig>  <cit> , and pi3kca  mutation could affect ddr pathway by brca <dig> protein localization.

mir-27a and mir- <dig>  by regulating their targets, were involved in mesh terms emt, glycolysis, drug resistance neoplasm, cell death, and receptors cytokines. mir-27a is known to induce paclitaxel-resistance in ovarian cancer cells by targeting hipk <dig>  followed by reduced mdr <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, it is tempting to speculate that fulvestrant resistance may possibly share the same mechanism with paclitaxel. mir- <dig> was slightly up-regulated in mcf7-t and down-regulated in mcf7-f. by repressing various targets, mir- <dig> has been known to negatively regulate emt and metastasis  <cit>  via stat <dig> and igf1r  <cit> . in our previous study  <cit> , we validated that mcf7-f cells had not only reduced cell-cell contacts but increased malignant morphology and characteristics  compared to the other two cell lines , indicating that mcf7-f underwent emt and further malignancy. cluster  <dig> further indicates a key role for mir- <dig> down-regulation in fulvestrant resistance, perhaps due to altered regulation of emt and malignant progression. in addition, because igf1r is not only an upstream regulator of metabolism  but also regulates stat <dig>  mir- <dig> may represent a key regulator of both metabolism and a signaling pathway . in summary, cluster  <dig> shows that mir-146a and brca1/ <dig> are shared molecular characteristics of the tamoxifen and the fulvestrant resistances  and are closely associated in terms of the ddr pathway . mir- <dig> may contribute to the differences in epigenetic background between the two distinct forms of antiestrogen resistance.

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> describe the differential two drug-resistant states in terms of mirna-target interaction, because the two mirnas  and their targets show opposite expression. in particular, mir- <dig> plays an important role both in cancer as well as in stem cell biology  <cit> , inducing emt and thus contributing to migration, invasion, and morphological change. mir- <dig> up-regulation is also consistent in the cell morphology changes associated with acquired antiestrogen resistance  <cit> . mcf7-t cells grow as tightly packed colonies with limited cell spreading, while mcf7-f cells, by contrast, show reduced cell-cell contacts compared with mcf <dig> or mcf7-t cells and are loosely attached to the culture surface. thus, the target genes of the mirna in this cluster   <cit>  could be involved in emt as well as in malignant transformation of mcf7-f. in addition, expression of the tfs  upstream of mir- <dig> was differentially changed between the two drug resistant cell lines and the differential tf usage could also contribute expression changes of this mirna.

in cluster  <dig>  mir- <dig> and its targets showed opposite expression patterns in mcf7-t and mcf7-f and thus could contribute to the different drug-resistant states. as the majority of studies indicate that mir- <dig> is an oncogene  <cit> , this mirna could play a role in acquired resistance to tamoxifen. however, depending on the biological context, it has been suggested that mir- <dig> may have a tumor suppressor role  <cit> . thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that different cellular contexts could also contribute to the distinct drug-resistant phenotypes.

clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have the same expression patterns between mcf7-t and -f, implying that the three clusters could be involved in common molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to serms and serds. let-7b, mir-15a, and mir-125b were up-regulated in both antiestrogen-resistant cell lines. in particular, mir-125b has been reported to play important roles in drug-resistance  <cit>  and may be an oncogene  <cit>  in breast cancer. experimental validation of the functional roles of mir-125b target mrnas  during acquired antiestrogen resistance is ongoing in our laboratory.

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were of interest in terms of mutual regulatory loops. the mir- <dig> and cdkn1b  loop in cluster  <dig> was conserved in mcf7-t and -f in terms of expression, while sip <dig> and mir- <dig> in cluster  <dig> showed an opposite expression pattern. in particular, mir- <dig>  <cit>  in cluster  <dig> is closely aligned with erα status and antiestrogen resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied a systems biology approach  <cit>  to mcf7-derived drug resistant cell lines by utilizing mirnas, mrnas and text-mining. by using the systems approach to examine global mirna-target mrna network in the context of the hallmarks of cancer  <cit> , we identified several important network clusters involved not only in antiestrogen resistance mechanisms but also in differentiating resistance to serms and serds. to date, only mir-221/ <dig> has been shown to be involved in serm- and serd-resistance as well as in erα status. our computation reveals that multiple microrna-related network clusters , in addition to the mir-221/ <dig> network cluster, may contribute to antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells. recent reports  <cit>  appropriately advocate the need for validating mirna microarray data. despite this limitation of the current study, we utilized mirna-oriented network as well as cancer contexts to implement a systems biology approach in the field of breast cancer and antiestrogen resistance.
