BACKGROUND
in angiosperms, the pollen grain contains the male gametophyte. the male gametophyte extends a pollen tube that grows through female tissues in order to deliver sperm to the embryo sac for double fertilization. callose, a β  <dig> -glucan, is the major component of the pollen tube cell wall
 <cit> . callose can be visualized by staining with decolorized aniline blue
 <cit> . growing pollen tubes form periodic callose plugs that are thought to block off the older parts of the tube and maintain the cytoplasm near the growing tip
 <cit> . callose plugs exist in pollen tubes of all flowering plants, although their morphology and the pattern of callose plug deposition varies among species
 <cit> . callose plugs were proposed as a critical novelty for accelerated pollen tube growth during angiosperm evolution
 <cit> , as angiosperm pollen tubes have callosic walls and callose plugs, whereas callose plugs are absent in pollen tubes of gymnosperms.

callose plug deposition has been correlated with pollen tube growth rate. for example, the number of callose plugs was used as an indicator of pollen tube growth rate in hibiscus moscheutos <cit> . in tomato, antisense lines for the pollen receptor kinase leprk <dig> showed abnormal callose plug deposition and slower pollen tube growth than in wild type
 <cit> . leshy is a protein that interacts with leprk2; in petunia, antisense lines for shy showed no callose plugs in pollen tubes, and nearly all the pollen tubes failed to reach ovules
 <cit> . however, in arabidopsis, one report
 <cit>  questioned a need for callose plugs, as pollen tubes carrying a mutant allele of callose synthase  <dig>  cals5- <dig>  had no callose plugs, but grew normally in vitro and in vivo. seed set on cals5- <dig> homozygous plants was normal, although transmission of the cal5- <dig> allele was slightly reduced in heterozygotes .

arabidopsis has been used as a model plant for genetic studies. many ecotypes have been used to investigate genetic variation in numerous physiological processes
 <cit> , and recombinant inbred lines and doubled haploid populations have been used to map genes underlying such variation
 <cit> . although callose plug morphology differs in different species
 <cit> , to our knowledge variation within a species has not been examined. during the course of other experiments, we noticed that pollen tubes of the arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes ler and columbia  appeared to vary in the position of the first callose plug; columbia had the callose plug near the grain, while in ler the callose plug was farther away. we therefore decided to systematically examine callose plug position in many arabidopsis ecotypes, and in tomato species. here we document variation of callose plug deposition in arabidopsis ecotypes and in tomato species
 <cit>  and demonstrate that there is a relationship between callose plug deposition and pollen tube growth.

RESULTS
in vitro pollen germination is robust and reproducible in many ecotypes
we first investigated whether the in vitro pollen germination protocol developed in our lab for the arabidopsis thaliana columbia ecotype could be used for other ecotypes
 <cit> . for consistency, we always used 2– <dig> freshly opened flowers for germination assays. after  <dig> hours germination, we added decolorized aniline blue to visualize callose plugs, transferred the slides to 4°c to stop tube growth, and photographed slides on which most pollen grains had germinated and pollen tubes appeared healthy. all but one of the ecotypes tested formed pollen tubes and callose plugs. for measurements, we selected pollen tubes for which it was easy to trace the length of the pollen tube from grain to tip . an unpaired t test showed that the lengths of fifty such randomly selected healthy pollen tubes of each ecotype were not significantly different, in two independent experiments . we therefore concluded that in vitro pollen germination and tube growth within each ecotype was reproducible. pollen of the shahdara ecotype germinated very poorly in this medium, and the few pollen tubes that did form had abnormal morphologies. it is possible that a germination medium suitable for shahdara could be devised, but we excluded it from further experiments. although we had initially noticed a difference between the position of callose plugs in col and ler, we did not use ler in these experiments because its germination percentage was considerably lower than in other ecotypes.

the first callose plug position varies among ecotypes in arabidopsis
after  <dig> hours of germination, we measured the first interval length  of  <dig> randomly selected pollen tubes in  <dig> ecotypes. we used the  <dig> hour time point in order to ensure that all the pollen grains had had ample time to grow a tube, as germination initiation is not synchronous
 <cit> . within an ecotype, the average lengths of the first interval in two independent experiments were reproducible  but the average lengths were different in different ecotypes. in about 50% of the ecotypes, the average length of the first interval was around 50μm, indicating that the first callose plug was consistently close to the pollen grain, but in the ws, c <dig>  est, and van ecotypes, the average first interval length was longer, and the standard deviations were extremely large. large standard deviations were also observed in cvi, bay, nd and nok.

to further investigate the differences of the first callose plug position in all ecotypes, we pooled together  <dig> first intervals from two independent experiments and grouped them according to the length of first interval . there was a wide distribution of first interval lengths among the  <dig> ecotypes, ranging from 11μm to 394μm. we arbitrarily divided pollen tubes into two groups. in the first group the first interval was <150μm, i.e. the first callose plugs were close to the grain; in the second group the first interval was ≥150μm, i.e. the first callose plugs were farther away from the grain. all ecotypes had some pollen tubes with the first interval <150μm, but some ecotypes also had pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm. the portion of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm varied from 0%  to 66%  among these  <dig> ecotypes. we further subdivided this group; if the portion of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm in one ecotype was lower than 20%, we treated that ecotype as having one pattern of first callose plug deposition, i.e. with the first callose plug close to the pollen grain. however, if the portion of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm in one ecotype was higher than 20%, we defined that ecotype as having two deposition patterns. after applying this criterion, ws, c <dig>  est and van had two patterns for first callose plug position . thus the first callose plug position not only varied between different ecotypes, but also varied within certain ecotypes.

ecotypes are presumed to be uniform, so this variation of first callose plug position in an ecotype was unexpected. to test whether seed contamination might explain this variation, we used c <dig>  we assayed pollen from  <dig> individual plants after  <dig> hours of pollen germination; each showed variation in first callose plug position, and among  <dig> plants the portions of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm ranged from 27-34% , similar to the results shown in figure
1c, suggesting that the variation was not due to seed contamination. we further checked pollen from  <dig> individual flowers or from individual anthers, each of which still showed variation in the first callose plug position and had similar proportions of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm , indicating that variation of callose plug position in c <dig> was inherent. such variation in one ecotype might be due to phenotypic noise
 <cit> .

patterns of callose plug deposition are heritable
to test whether variation of first callose plug position between ecotypes was heritable, we performed reciprocal crosses between ecotypes with different patterns for the first callose plug position. c <dig> has two patterns while col has only one pattern . the average length of  <dig> first intervals in the two f1s was intermediate of the parental average lengths . however, the distributions of the first interval length of the two f1s was similar to that of c <dig>  and moreover the proportion of pollen tubes of the two f1s with the first intervals ≥150μm was larger than 20% and thus similar to that of c <dig> . this indicated that the two f1s had two patterns of first callose plug position, as did c <dig>  this suggested that the pattern of the first callose plug position was heritable and that having two patterns was dominant. the similar first interval lengths in the two f1s indicated that there were no parental effects on callose plug position. like c <dig>  ws has two patterns of first callose plug position . we therefore reciprocally crossed ws and c <dig> to investigate how the two patterns of first callose plug position were inherited in the f1s. the average first interval lengths in the two f1s were not significantly different from those of the parents , moreover, the distributions of the first interval length in the two f1s were also similar to those of the parents. the proportion of pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm were larger than 20% , which indicated that the two f1s had two deposition patterns. we used reciprocal crosses between col and an to investigate how the first callose plug position was inherited when the parents only had one pattern for the position of the first callose plug. the distributions of the first interval length in the two f1s were similar to those of the parents  and no pollen tubes with the first interval ≥150μm were observed in either f <dig>  suggesting that these f1s had one deposition pattern, as did the parents. however, the average lengths of the first intervals in the two col × an f1s were significantly longer than those of the parents . together, these results suggested that variation of the first callose plug position in one ecotype was controlled by genetics, and that the trait of two patterns of deposition of the first callose plug was dominant. the dominance was unexpected, as we predicted that callose plug position would be controlled by the gametophyte, as callose plugs are deposited in pollen tubes after pollen germination. thus in a gametophytic control scenario and assuming that one gene controls the trait, we expected that 50% of the pollen tubes would have one pattern of first callose plug deposition and 50% of the pollen tubes would have two patterns. c <dig> had 31% pollen tubes that had long first intervals, therefore only 15% of the f <dig> pollen tubes were expected to have a long first interval. however, the percentages of pollen tubes with long intervals in f1s from the col × c <dig> reciprocal crosses were 35% and 26%, much more than the expected 15%. this did not support that this trait was controlled by a single gametophytic gene. if the trait was controlled by multiple genes, a range of intermediate phenotypes between both parental phenotypes might be expected, but that was not the case. dominance therefore is most consistent with sporophytic control; however, we don’t understand how the sporophyte would contribute to this phenotype. before attempting to genetically map the responsible gene, it will be important to consider other parameters that might influence this trait, such as sporophytically-derived pollen wall proteins, or paternal provisioning.

pollen tube length variability in parents and f <dig> hybrids
the average length of the pollen tubes varied in different ecotypes after 6h pollen germination . in most ecotypes, the tube length was around 400μm, but in wa and ei they were longer, 860μm and 665μm, respectively. this implied that wa and ei pollen tubes grew much faster than those of other ecotypes. when measuring the patterns of callose plug deposition in parents and f <dig> hybrids , we also noticed that the pollen tube lengths varied in tested f <dig> hybrids, but there was no difference in reciprocal crosses . the pollen tubes of f1s generated from crosses of c <dig> and col were significantly longer  than those of their parents  ; this phenomenon was also observed in f <dig> hybrids from c <dig> and ws crosses , suggesting the possibility of heterosis. however, this possible heterosis was not observed in f <dig> hybrids from crosses of an and col . such differences, i.e. presence or absence of a heterotic effect, have previously been reported, depending on the parents used in the cross
 <cit> .

callose plugs continue to elongate in most ecotypes
we noticed that the length of callose plugs in col were longer when we had germinated pollen for a long time  before staining with aniline blue. therefore, we examined whether this phenomenon occurred in the other ecotypes. after  <dig> hours of germination, the c <dig>  van, bay, cvi, ei, nd, nok, got <dig>  est and tsu and ws ecotypes similarly had longer callose plugs , but the callose plugs of an and wa were not longer at  <dig> hours . in ecotypes with longer callose plugs at  <dig> hours, it was mostly the first callose plug that had elongated . to test if this phenotype was heritable, we examined f <dig> progeny of reciprocal crosses between an and c <dig>  pollen tubes of the f1s had longer callose plugs after 30h germination , suggesting that the c <dig> phenotype was heritable and dominant. callose plug elongation implies that callose synthase continues to be active at the callose deposition site, but it is not clear why ecotypes would vary for this parameter.

callose plug deposition is associated with pollen tube length
we were interested in determining where and when callose plugs are initiated. however, in the preceding experiments, most callose plugs were completely deposited and we were unable to directly observe callose plug initiation, because aniline blue staining and 4°c incubation halts pollen tube growth. we therefore used c <dig> and a time course experiment  to determine the approximate time that callose plugs started to form. after  <dig> hours of germination, 34% of the pollen tubes had a first callose plug close to the grain , whereas 66% of the pollen had shorter tubes ) and had not yet formed a callose plug. after  <dig> hours of germination, more pollen tubes had formed a callose plug close to the grain, but about 50% of the tubes, although longer than at  <dig> hours, still had no callose plug. after  <dig> hours of germination, 65% of the pollen tubes had formed a first callose plug, including 48% with the first callose plug close to the grain and 17% with a first callose plug farther away from the grain, suggesting that most of the first callose plugs were formed within  <dig> hours of germination. additionally, we noticed that the pattern of callose plugs with the first interval <150μm shifted to a pattern with the first interval ≥150μm between  <dig> to  <dig> hours germination, because the percentage of pollen tubes with the first interval <150μm decreased from 3h to 4h germination.

to determine where the first callose plugs form, we selected tubes that were forming callose plugs , then determined the position where they started to form. nearly all  of the forming callose plugs were found near the pollen tube tip , indicating that callose plug deposition started near pollen tube tip. this raised a question about the relationship between callose plug position and the position of the sperm cells during pollen tube growth. we therefore used a c <dig> line in which a pduo1::nlsmrfp construct was present, and carried out a time course of pollen germination. the duo <dig> promoter is expressed in sperm cells
 <cit>  and thus the pduo1::nlsmrfp reporter can be used to image sperm cell nuclei. the dapi filter set used to visualize staining with aniline blue overlaps with the mrfp channel, so that we could see both the sperm nuclei and the callose plugs. some callose plugs  were proximal to the position of the sperm , and some callose plugs were distal to the position of the sperm . the time course showed that around 30% of the sperm cells were behind the callose plug at each time point . however, in movies generated from the images , sperm cells were seen passing through callose plugs in pollen tubes that had not yet ceased growth after staining with aniline blue. therefore, it is plausible that the 30% sperm cells observed behind callose plugs were in tubes in which the aniline blue arrested growth before the sperm cells passed through the callose plug. it was previously reported in tobacco that vegetative and generative cells could be trapped behind callose plugs but could squeeze through a forming callose plug

as many pollen tubes of the c <dig> ecotype did not have callose plugs after  <dig> or  <dig> hours germination, we were able to use c <dig> to investigate whether callose plug deposition correlated with pollen tube length, without any ecotype effect. the time course analysis  was used to compare the lengths of pollen tubes with or without callose plugs. the average tube length of pollen tubes without a callose plug was significantly shorter than those with a callose plug. additionally, after  <dig> hours of germination, the average length of tubes with the first callose plug close to the grain  was significantly longer than tubes with the first callose plug far away from the grain . we carried out correlation analyses with the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hour time points; the first interval length and pollen tube length were significantly correlated at  <dig> hours  and at  <dig> hours , but not at  <dig> hours. perhaps at the  <dig> hour time point there was still residual variability due to different times of pollen tube initiation.

variation of callose plug deposition in tomato species
to determine if variation in the first callose plug position occurred in other species, we measured the first and second intervals and pollen tube lengths in seven different tomato species. the pollen germination method described in
 <cit>  for solanum lycopersicum worked well for the other six species, and an unpaired t test showed that the average first intervals of  <dig> randomly selected healthy pollen tubes from two individual experiments were reproducible . the average length of the first interval varied from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm among the  <dig> species . the two individual experiments  were pooled and used to determine the distribution of the first callose plug position. the same grouping criterion for first interval length used for arabidopsis  was used. only s. chilense had a large portion  of pollen tubes with the first interval length <150μm, suggesting that s. chilense had two patterns for the first callose plug position. the proportions of pollen tubes with the first interval <150μm in the other species were smaller than 20%, suggesting that those species mostly had one pattern for the first callose plug position. although most intervals in those species were grouped into a single pattern, variations were observed . thus variation of the first callose position among different species or in one species also exists in tomato. we also noticed that s. pennellii showed two patterns for the second callose plug position: one close to first callose plug  and another farther away . we therefore checked all  <dig> tomato species; all had pollen tubes where the second callose plug position was far away from the first one, but s. habrochaites, s. pennellii and s. sitiens also showed a pattern where 22%, 50% or 25%, respectively, of the second callose plugs were near the first one. the phenomenon of callose plug elongation  was not observed in any of the tomato species after prolonged  germination.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies show that all but one of the arabidopsis ecotypes tested formed pollen tubes during in vitro germination. we showed that the position of the first callose plug varies among arabidopsis ecotypes and in some cases within one ecotype. the callose plug deposition patterns were heritable; having two patterns of callose plug within an ecotype is dominant. callose plug deposition correlated with pollen tube length and pollen tube lengths in f <dig> hybrids sometimes exceeded those of the parents. variation in callose plug deposition was also seen in species of tomato. these assays were all carried out in vitro, and it is important to acknowledge that there might be differences in the parameters we measured when pollen tubes grow in the pistil, because of potential influences of the female tissue. although the significance of these callose plug deposition differences are not known, these findings lay a foundation for mapping genes that regulate callose plug deposition or those that determine pollen tube lengths or growth rate.
