BACKGROUND
the innate defense system plays a key role in protecting the host against microorganism-fueled infections such as candidiasis caused by candida albicans. c. albicans colonizes several body sites, including the oral cavity; however, as a commensal organism, it causes no apparent damage or inflammation in the surrounding tissue  <cit> . c. albicans is a polymorphic organism that adheres to different surfaces in the body and can grow as yeast, pseudohyphae, and hyphae  <cit> , usually in the form of biofilm. c. albicans transition, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis are under the control of various genes. the hwp <dig> gene encodes the hyphal cell wall protein, which is a hyphal-specific adhesin that is essential to biofilm formation  <cit> . the involvement of hwp <dig> in c. albicans adhesion is supported by the eap <dig> gene which encodes a glucan-crosslinked cell wall protein . together, these components mediate c. albicans adhesion to various surfaces, such as epithelial cells and polystyrene  <cit> . like many other genes, hwp <dig> and eap <dig> are downstream effectors of efg <dig> and nrg <dig> as transcription factors  <cit> . efg <dig> mutant strain has been shown to exhibit defects in growth, biofilm formation, and virulence  <cit> , while nrg <dig> represses filamentous growth  <cit> . this occurs through the dna binding protein nrg1p in conjunction with the global transcriptional repressor tup1p to suppress hyphal formation. elevated nrg <dig> expression represses the expression of a number of hypha-specific genes, although nrg <dig> downregulation is associated with c. albicans filaments  <cit> .

c. albicans virulence is also mediated by proteolytic enzymes, including secreted aspartyl proteinases   <cit> . the contribution of saps in c. albicans adherence, tissue damage, and evasion of host immune responses has been reported  <cit> . sap <dig> is crucial to c. albicans growth in protein-containing media  <cit> . sap <dig> and sap <dig> are expressed during phenotypic switching  <cit> , while sap <dig>  sap <dig>  and sap <dig> are expressed upon hyphal formation  <cit> , and saps 1- <dig> and 9- <dig> are involved in the adhesion mechanism to host cells  <cit> .

to control c. albicans pathogenesis, the host innate immunity uses small molecules such as proteins and peptides that display a broad antimicrobial spectrum. the number of identified potentially antimicrobial peptides is significant and continues to increase  <cit> . antimicrobial peptides often possess common attributes, such as small size, an overall positive charge, and amphipathicity  <cit> ; however, they also fall into a number of distinctively diverse groups, including α-helical peptides, β-sheet peptides, peptides with mixed α-helical and β-sheet structures, extended peptides, and peptides enriched in specific amino acids  <cit> .

in humans, epithelial cells and neutrophils are the most important cells producing antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . these peptides are most often antibacterial, although antifungal activity has also been reported  <cit> . the major peptide groups known to date are the histatins, cathelicidins, defensins, and lactoferricins  <cit> . the antimicrobial activity of these peptides has been reported by different in vitro and in vivo studies  <cit> . their complex role as well as their contribution to host defenses may be related to the functional interrelationship between innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> .

the interest in antimicrobial peptides lies in the possible resistance of microorganisms to conventional antimicrobial strategies used against microbial pathogens in both agriculture and medicine  <cit> . natural antimicrobial peptides are necessary in the control of microbial infections. for example, the use of amps provided protection against such microbial pathogens as fungal pathogens, with no reported effect on the host  <cit> . based on these promising data, a number of synthetic amps have been designed to overcome microbial infections  <cit> . in the pursuit of a novel alternative antifungal treatment, we developed a synthetic α-helical antimicrobial decapeptide, ksl , and its analogue ksl-w   <cit> .

the efficacy of ksl on a wide range of microorganisms has been established  <cit> , as well as its ability to disrupt oral biofilm growth  <cit> . ksl-w, a recently synthesized ksl analogue, was shown to display improved stability in simulated oral and gastric conditions with in vitro preserved antimicrobial activity  <cit> . furthermore, combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of benzalkonium chloride, a known cationic surface-active agent  <cit> , ksl was shown to significantly promote bacterial biofilm susceptibility. we also recently demonstrated that ksl-w had a selective effect on c. albicans growth, while exhibiting no toxic effect on epithelial cells  <cit> .

as this ksl-w analogue displays a wide range of microbicidal activities, effectively kills bacteria, controls biofilm formation, and destroys intact biofilms, we hypothesized that ksl-w may also possess antifungal potential. our goal was thus to investigate the ability of ksl-w to inhibit c. albicans growth and transition from blastospore to hyphal form. the action of ksl-w on biofilm formation/disruption was also assessed. finally, we examined the effect of ksl-w on various c. albicans genes involved in its growth, transition, and virulence.

RESULTS
antimicrobial peptide ksl-w reduced c. albicans growth and transition from blastospore to hyphal form
c. albicans cultures were incubated with ksl-w for  <dig>   <dig>  and 15 h to determine whether this antimicrobial peptide had any adverse effect on c. albicans growth. as shown in figure  <dig>  ksl-w significantly reduced c. albicans proliferation. after 5 h of contact with ksl-w, the growth inhibition of c. albicans was between  <dig> and 80%, depending on the concentration of ksl-w used . after 10 h of contact with ksl-w, growth inhibition was significant, beginning at 25 μg/ml . at later culture periods, c. albicans growth continued to be significantly affected by the presence of ksl-w . indeed, with 25 μg/ml of ksl-w, c. albicans growth was almost half that in the controls , and with 100 μg/ml of ksl-w, c. albicans growth was reduced by almost 60%. it is interesting to note that ksl-w in as low as 25 μg/ml was effective at both the early and late culture periods.

as ksl-w contributed to c. albicans growth inhibition, we hypothesized that it would also downregulate c. albicans transition from yeast form to hyphal phenotype. yeast cultures supplemented with 10% fbs and the ksl-w peptide were maintained for various incubation periods. as shown in figure  <dig>  germ tube formation was inhibited as early as 4 h following exposure to the peptide, compared to that in the cultures incubated in the absence of ksl-w. of interest is the elevated number of c. albicans hyphal forms in the negative control culture  compared to the low number in the presence of ksl-w. the effect of this antimicrobial peptide on c. albicans transition was also dose-dependent: at 1 μg/ml, a significant number of hyphal forms remained, and at only 5 μg/ml of ksl-w, c. albicans transition was completely inhibited . semi-quantitative analyses using inverted microscope observations to estimate the hyphal forms confirmed the inhibited c. albicans transition when treated with ksl-w . the density of the hyphae was reduced as early as 4 h of contact with 5 μg/ml of ksl-w. this effect was further supported when c. albicans was placed in contact with ksl-w for 8 h , thus confirming that ksl-w downregulated c. albicans growth and transition.

ksl-w reduced c. albicans biofilm formation
as ksl-w contributed to reducing c. albicans growth and transition, we sought to determine whether it also displayed inhibitory activity against c. albicans biofilm formation. using a biofilm-promoting scaffold, sem analyses, and an xtt assay, we were able to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of ksl-w on biofilm formation . sem analyses revealed a significant density of c. albicans in the untreated culture, compared to a lower density in the scaffold in the presence of ksl-w  after 4 days of culture. the decreases obtained with the ksl-w, particularly at 25 μg/ml , were comparable to that obtained with amphotericin b at 10 μg/ml. to confirm these observations, we performed quantitative analyses using the xtt assay. figure 4a shows that after 2 days of culture, ksl-w was able to inhibit biofilm formation. this inhibitory effect was observed beginning at 25 μg/ml of ksl-w. at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>  and 100 μg/ml of ksl-w, the inhibition of c. albicans biofilm formation was comparable to that caused by amphotericin b at 10 μg/ml. similar results were obtained after 4 days  and 6 days  of culture for biofilm formation with a persistent inhibitory effect of ksl-w on c. albicans biofilm formation.

ksl-w disrupted mature c. albicans biofilms
after 6 days of incubation in glucose-rich sabouraud medium, scaffolds seeded with c. albicans strain sc <dig> produced mature biofilms displaying highly dense populations of candida cells . significant reductions and disruptions of the pre-formed candida biofilms were observed when the reference antifungal agent  was added to the mature biofilms upon further incubation up to 6 days. similarly, antimicrobial peptide ksl-w at  <dig> and 100 μg/ml also reduced c. albicans density in the biofilms. the observed reduction was noticed with ksl-w concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 100 μg/ml. indeed, when quantitatively investigated by xtt reduction assay, the ksl-w-treated biofilms rendered a significantly lower number of cells, as reflected by the lower absorbance readings, than did the untreated control. this effect was observed after  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 days of treatment with amphotericin b. furthermore, the effect of ksl-w on the mature c. albicans biofilm was comparable to that obtained with amphotericin b .

ksl-w modulated the expression of various c. albicans genes
based on the data showing that ksl-w reduced c. albicans proliferation, transition, and biofilm formation, we sought to determine the involvement, if any, of gene regulation. for this purpose, we first investigated the effect of ksl-w on the activation/repression of various c. albicans genes when cultured under normal non-hyphae-inducing conditions. the data in table  <dig> indicate that the hwp <dig> gene was significantly downregulated following exposure of the c. albicans to ksl-w for 6 h. this downregulation was comparable to that observed in the amphotericin b treatment. similarly, saps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were significantly downregulated by ksl-w treatment after 6 h . this effect was observed with both low and high concentrations of ksl-w. furthermore, the eap <dig> gene, which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, glucan-crosslinked cell wall protein in both adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo, was also affected by the ksl-w treatment. moreover, the expression of this gene was downregulated by ksl-w, yet was upregulated  by amphotericin b.

two other genes involved in regulating c. albicans morphogenesis, namely, efg <dig> and nrg <dig>  are known to be hyphae repressors. in our study, amphotericin b increased both efg <dig> and nrg <dig> mrna expression, with twice as much expression for nrg <dig> than for efg <dig> , while ksl-w induced a less significant increase of efg <dig> and nrg <dig> mrna expression. of interest is that a low ksl-w concentration  induced greater gene expression .

in a second set of experiments, c. albicans was cultured under hyphae-inducing conditions  in the presence or not of ksl-w, after which time gene expression/repression was investigated. the data in table  <dig> reveal that similar to the results obtained with amphotericin-b, the hwp <dig> gene was significantly  downregulated when c. albicans was exposed to ksl-w for 3 h, confirming the results obtained under non-hyphae growth conditions.

sap genes were also modulated by ksl-w treatment. table  <dig> shows that after 3 h of exposure, saps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were significantly  downregulated by the ksl-w treatment. in contrast, with amphotericin-b, a significant  increase of saps  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and a decrease of sap <dig> was observed. it is interesting to note the opposite modulatory effects of ksl-w and amphotericin-b on sap gene expression. after 6 h of treatment with ksl-w, a significant decrease of each tested sap gene was observed in the exposed c. albicans, whereas after treatment with amphotericin-b, these same sap genes increased, thus confirming the antagonistic behavior of ksl-w and amphotericin-b on sap gene expression.

c. albicans eap <dig> gene expression was unchanged after 3 h with ksl-w, but significantly  decreased after 6 h, while the expression of this gene was upregulated  by amphotericin b . amphotericin b increased nrg <dig> mrna expression almost threefold, with no significant effect on the efg <dig> gene, yet significantly decreased hwp <dig> gene expression. on the other hand, after 3 h  and 6 h  of incubation, ksl-w downregulated efg <dig>  nrg <dig>  and hwp <dig> mrna expression. of interest is that except for similar downregulatory effects on hwp <dig> gene expression, ksl-w and amphotericin-b produced once again opposite results regarding efg1and nrg <dig> gene expression.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that ksl-w was effective in inhibiting c. albicans growth at short and long culture periods. although growth inhibition obtained with ksl-w was less than that obtained with amphotericin b, the effects of ksl-w nevertheless remain significant . the growth inhibition effects of ksl-w are in accordance with previously reported findings  <cit>  showing a downregulation of c. albicans activity induced by a bacteriocin-like peptide isolated from lactobacillus pentosus. furthermore, our results support other findings  <cit>  reporting the effectiveness of ksl-w in disrupting p. gingivalis-induced hemagglutination and its synergistic interaction with host amps engaged in innate defense. the results strongly suggest that ksl-w is also effective against fungal growth and may be suitable for use to control c. albicans infections. further studies on the possible synergistic effect of amphotericin b and ksl-w against c. albicans growth may provide insight.

c. albicans pathogenesis can also take place through the transition from blastospore to hyphal form  <cit> . our results indeed show that ksl-w completely inhibited c. albicans transition with a concentration as low as 5 μg/ml. these data are consistent with those of other studies with naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides  which were effective in blocking the morphological shift of candida from yeast to hyphae  <cit> . thus ksl-w may possibly contribute to the control of c. albicans infection by reducing cell growth and yeast-hyphae transition. the effect of ksl-w on c. albicans growth can occur either through cytolysis or cell membrane disruption, resulting in cell death similar to what has been demonstrated with histatin- <dig>  <cit> . indeed, it was shown that histatin- <dig> induces the selective leakage of intracellular ions and atp from yeast cells. this is caused by the translocation of histatin- <dig> into the intracellular compartment and accumulates to a critical concentration  <cit> . further studies are thus warranted to shed light on the fungicidal mechanism of ksl-w.

c. albicans growth and transition from blastospore to hyphal form are particularly important for biofilm formation and c. albicans virulence because a strain that is genetically manipulated to grow exclusively in the yeast form is greatly hindered in generating biofilms. in addition, a variety of c. albicans mutants known to be unable to form hyphae also show biofilm defects  <cit> . as ksl-w significantly reduced c. albicans growth and inhibited its transition from yeast to hyphae, this suggests that ksl-w may inhibit c. albicans biofilm formation. our findings indicate that ksl-w was indeed able to reduce biofilm formation and that its effect was comparable to that obtained with amphotericin b, a well-known antifungal molecule. also of interest is that a significant inhibition of c. albicans biofilm formation was obtained at a concentration of as low as 25 μg/ml of ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. these useful data are comparable to those of other studies showing the positive action of synthetic peptide in controlling and preventing microbial biofilm formation  <cit> . thus, with its significant impact in reducing c. albicans biofilm formation, ksl-w may show potential for several novel applications in the clinical setting. further investigations will elucidate this effect.

biofilm formation can be controlled with anti-biofilm molecules prior to its development, although this is not actually the case in clinical applications, as antifungal and microbial molecules cannot be used on a daily basis to prevent biofilm formation. an effective molecule should ideally be able to prevent biofilm formation, but more importantly to disrupt biofilms that are already formed. we therefore questioned whether ksl-w was capable of disrupting mature c. albicans biofilm.

we proceeded to examine the impact of ksl-w on mature biofilm formation and demonstrated a significant disruption of these biofilms following contact with ksl-w, thus suggesting the possible use of this antimicrobial peptide to reduce/eliminate mature biofilms. further studies should confirm such observations and demonstrate how ksl-w reduces or disrupts c. albicans biofilms.

once it reaches the cell, ksl-w can potentially act on the cytoplasmic membrane as well as on intracellular targets  <cit> . the action of ksl-w against c. albicans may operate through the modulated expression of certain c. albicans genes that control growth  <cit> , transition  <cit> , and biofilm formation  <cit> . we therefore examined the effect of ksl-w on a number of genes either directly or indirectly involved in phase transition and biofilm formation. efg <dig> and nrg <dig> expression was assessed under hyphae/non-hyphae-inducing conditions. our results show that ksl-w increased nrg <dig> mrna expression twofold under non-hyphae-inducing conditions; however, under hyphae-inducing conditions, ksl-w significantly reduced nrg <dig> gene expression. these findings contrast with other reports that an increased nrg <dig> expression contributes to repressing various hypha-specific genes  <cit> . this confirms that the effect of ksl-w in controlling c. albicans virulence does not take place through nrg <dig>  ksl-w was also able to decrease efg <dig> mrna expression, when c. albicans was maintained under hyphae-inducing conditions.

efg1p has been found to be a central regulator of c. albicans, as it is required for the development of a true hyphal growth form, and efg <dig> is considered to be essential in the interactions between c. albicans and human host cells  <cit> . the downregulation of this gene by ksl-w points to the singular role of this antifungal peptide. thus the effect of ksl-w on c. albicans transition can be manifested through a repression of certain genes, such as efg <dig> and nrg <dig> 

ksl-w has a significant inhibitory effect on eap <dig> mrna expression. as a member of the gpi-cwp family  <cit> , deleting eap <dig> can reduce the adhesion of c. albicans to different surfaces. this suggests that treatment with ksl-w may reduce eap <dig> expression, which in turn may contribute to reducing c. albicans adhesion and ultimately, biofilm formation and pathogenesis. ksl-w was also shown to reduce hwp <dig> mrna expression, particularly when c. albicans was cultured under hyphae-inducing conditions.

hwp <dig> is a downstream component of the camp-dependent pka pathway and is positively regulated by efg <dig>  <cit> . the transcript level of hwp <dig> decreased with the ksl-w treatment at low and high concentrations. these data suggest that ksl-w indeed impacts the activity of the camp–efg <dig> pathway and leads to an alteration of c. albicans growth and morphogenesis. further studies are therefore required to investigate the invasion/virulence of ksl-w-treated c. albicans.

it is well known that candida pathogenesis can be established by virtue of candida growth and yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis. specific sap genes were found to be preferentially expressed by candida hyphal forms  <cit> . because ksl-w downregulated c. albicans growth and transition, this may have occurred through a modulation of the sap genes. our findings confirm that ksl-w is capable of decreasing sap <dig>  sap <dig>  sap <dig>  and sap <dig> mrna expression in c. albicans which may lead to reducing c. albicans virulence  <cit> .

our study thus establishes, for the first time, a clear link between an antimicrobial peptide , hyphae morphogenesis, and hyphae-modulating saps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  however, the precise interactions between these saps and ksl-w during c. albicans pathogenesis remain unclear. additional studies should focus on identifying the role of sap subfamilies involved in candida invasion as well as the role of ksl-w in controlling candida virulence/pathogenesis in conjunction with host defenses. in conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that synthetic antimicrobial peptide ksl-w downregulates c. albicans growth and transition, resulting in a decrease in biofilm formation and a disruption of mature biofilm. also of interest is that these effects may occur through the modulation of c. albicans genes efg <dig>  nrg <dig>  eap <dig>  hwp <dig>  and saps. overall results clearly suggest the potential of ksl-w as an antifungal molecule.
