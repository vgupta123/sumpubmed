BACKGROUND
cin <dig> is identified as a cbl-interacting protein of 85 kda and belongs to adaptor/scaffold proteins  <cit> . it consists of three src homology  domains, a proline-rich region and a putative α-helical coiled-coil domain at the extreme c-terminal end  <cit> . as an adaptor protein, cin <dig> is involved in cbl-dependent egfr internalization, intracellular receptor trafficking, sorting and degradation  <cit> . however, the detailed mechanisms by which cin <dig> mediates egfr endocytic process are not fully defined.

the activation of egfr by egf leads to the binding and ubiquitylation of the receptor by c-cbl, which then recruits cin <dig> to egfr-cbl complex to initiate the receptor endocytosis  <cit> . cin <dig>  on the other hand, constitutively binds to endophilins, the regulatory proteins that control endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . thus, cin <dig> tethers egfr-cbl complex to the endocytic machinery in an egf-dependent manner  <cit> . after internalization, c-cbl further catalyzes the receptor multi-ubiquitylation and cin <dig> mono-ubiquitylation in endosomes  <cit> . the ubiquitylated egfr is then sorted into multivesicular bodies and fused into lysosomes for degradation  <cit> .

egfr internalization and degradation is enhanced by overexpression of either phospholipase d <dig> or d <dig>  and inhibited by expression of inactive phospholipase d mutants or by treatment of cells with primary alcohols  <cit> . the function of phospholipase d in facilitating membrane endocytosis has largely been attributed to its ability to generate phosphatidic acid, a fusogenic lipid that lowers the activation energy required for inward curving of membrane  <cit> . upon egf stimulation, phospholipase d is activated in plasma membrane and the production of phosphatidic acid, which enhances membrane fusibility for endocytosis, is increased  <cit> .

in our previous study, it is identified that cin <dig> binds to phosphatidic acid  <cit> . this ability enables cin <dig> to target phosphatidic acid-enriched membrane. by interacting with egfr-cbl complex, endophilins and phosphatidic acid, cin <dig> acts as a mediator to bring the receptor, endocytic machinery and fusible membrane together. it is further identified that deletion of the coiled-coil domain blocks cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction, weakens cin85-cbl interaction, dissociates cin <dig> from membrane and reduces egfr degradation  <cit> .

the coiled-coil domain is well-known for its ability to form oligomers in coiled-coil domain-containing proteins, including cin <dig>  <cit> . by adding chemical cross-linking reagents, cin <dig> is found to form oligomers through its coiled-coil domain  <cit> . of  <dig> amino acid residues in the coiled-coil domain,  <dig> residues are basic amino acids   <cit> . the basic amino acid frequency  is much higher than that in an average protein. because phosphatidic acid is a negatively charged lipid, the cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction could be mediated by electric interaction between the negative charge of the lipid and the positive charge of basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain.

in the present study, we found that the basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain were essential for cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction. of 16 k and r residues in the coiled-coil domain, k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> were the most important. the alanine mutation of these  <dig> basic amino acids inhibited cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction, impaired the recruitment of cin <dig> by c-cbl, dissociated cin <dig> from egfr endosomes and reduced egfr degradation.

RESULTS
k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> in coiled-coil domain are essential for cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction and membrane association
it was previously identified that the interaction of cin <dig> with phosphatidic acid required the c-terminal coiled-coil domain  <cit> . in fact, coiled-coil domain alone was sufficient to bind phosphatidic acid . in total  <dig> amino acid residues of coiled-coil domain there are  <dig> lysine and  <dig> arginine residues . the enriched basic amino acid composition enables the coiled-coil domain to be positively charged in a neutral ph environment and interact with negatively charged proteins or lipids.these  <dig> basic amino acids naturally form  <dig> clusters, which were divided into  <dig> groups for generating mutations: group c includes k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r620; group b k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and k635; group a k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r650; group d k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> . they were mutated into alanine, a neutral amino acid, to verify which of these basic amino acids are involved in cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction . the mutation of all  <dig> basic amino acids  completely blocked cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction . it also inhibited cin <dig> oligomerization or the association of cin <dig> with membrane vesicles . essentially, mutation of these  <dig> basic amino acids exhibited the same effect as deletion of the coiled-coil domain .mutations of the basic amino acids in individual groups revealed that the basic amino acids in group a  were the most important for coiled-coil domain . mutation of these  <dig> basic amino acids  exhibited the same inhibitory effect as mutation of all  <dig> basic amino acids. mutations in other groups  did not affect or only partially inhibited the interaction of cin <dig> with phosphatidic acid .

the association of cin <dig> with membrane vesicles was most likely mediated by its interaction with phosphatidic acid . mutations that inhibited cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction also disrupted cin85-membrane vesicle association . in fact, cin <dig> only associates with liposome containing phosphatidic acid  and phosphatidyl choline , but not liposome of phosphatidyl choline alone  <cit> . the association with membrane might also facilitate the alignment of cin <dig> molecules on membrane surface, enabling them to oligomerize .further dissection of the basic amino acids in group a revealed that the presence of positive charges in this group was more important than the position of these positive charges. mutations of  <dig> basic amino acids ,  or  did not affect phosphatidic acid binding, membrane association or oligomerization . mutations of  <dig> basic amino acids had mixed effect on the coiled-coil domain. mutation of k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> did not affect phosphatidic acid binding, membrane association or oligomerization, whereas mutation of k <dig>  k <dig> and r <dig> inhibited these functions . in addition, mutation of either one of these four basic amino acids exhibited no inhibitory effect . overall, there was no single basic amino acid in k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> that was more prominent than the others.

k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are required for the recruitment of cin <dig> by egfr endocytic complex
egfr endocytosis requires the coordinated interaction among the receptor complex, endocytic machinery and membrane. as an adaptor protein, cin <dig> is recruited by c-cbl to egfr-cbl complex  <cit> . the interaction of cin <dig> with c-cbl is mediated by sh <dig> domains in cin <dig>  <cit> . no direct interaction between c-cbl and the coiled-coil domain of cin <dig> has been identified  <cit> . although the coiled-coil domain did not interact with c-cbl, deletion of this domain led to the impairment of cin85-cbl interaction .because the basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain were involved in cin85-lipid interaction , their role in cin85-cbl interaction was investigated. as shown in figure 3a, mutations of the basic amino acids had strong inhibitory effect on cin85-cbl interaction. except mutation in group b , which did not affect cin85-cbl interaction, all the other mutations  inhibited cin85-cbl interaction . for most cin <dig> mutants, the effect on cin85-cbl interaction was parallel to that on cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction. cin85-16m, a4m and d3m affected both phosphatidic and c-cbl binding, while cin85-b4m inhibited neither of them . cin85-c5m was the only exception that it inhibited the binding to c-cbl, but not to phosphatidic acid .

through the constitutive cin85-endophilin interaction, cin <dig> links egfr-cbl complex with endocytic machinery of clathrin-coated pits  <cit> . because cin85-endophilin interaction is mediated by the c-terminal part of cin <dig>  deletion of coiled-coil domain might disrupt the endophilin interacting region in cin <dig> c-terminus  <cit> . that was the case as deletion of the coiled-coil domain disrupted cin85-endophilin interaction . the less disruptive point mutations of the basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain revealed that cin85-endophilin interaction was independent from the positive charge in coiled-coil domain. there was no difference for endophilin to interact with cin <dig>  cin85-a4m, cin85-b4m or other mutants .since cin <dig> is recruited by c-cbl in egfr-cbl complex, the interaction between cin <dig> and c-cbl should not affect egfr-cbl complex. as shown in figure 3c, no matter whether the mutants could interact with c-cbl  or not , the presence of cin <dig> mutants had no effect on egfr-cbl interaction.

mutation of k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> dissociates cin <dig> from egfr endosomal membrane and affects the protein sorting process
in cos <dig> cells expressing cin <dig> null-function mutant , egf-stimulated egfr degradation was decreased, whereas in cells expressing neutral mutant  or wild type cin <dig> the ligand-stimulated receptor degradation was not affected . however, no difference in egfr internalization was observed in cos <dig> cells expressing egfp, cin <dig> or cin <dig> mutant  . thus, the expression of cin <dig> null-function mutant did not inhibit the receptor internalization per se . it only reduced the degradation of the internalized egfr . the inhibition of egfr degradation but not egfr internalization suggested that these cin <dig> null-function mutants interfere with egfr sorting/degradation process.

after egfr internalization, cin <dig> or the neutral mutant cin85-b4m was found to be associated with egfr endosomes . both of them exhibited similar endosome binding . in contrast, cin <dig> null-function mutants  did not associated with egfr endosomes . the internalized egfr is sorted by the assembly of escrt  on endosomal membrane  <cit> . vps  is a group of escrt components that are recruited to endosomal membrane by adaptor proteins  <cit> . it is possible that cin <dig> on endosomal membrane interacts with these escrt components to facilitate escrt assembly.

in our previous study, cin <dig> was found to be co-localized with vps <dig>  vps4m and chmp4b   <cit> . moreover, coiled-coil domain deletion  did not affect their cellular co-localization . there were also protein interactions between cin <dig> and vps <dig>  vps4m and chmp4b  . vps <dig> is a cytoplasmic atpase that is recruited to escrt-iii to regulate escrt dissociation  <cit> . it weakly interacted with cin <dig>   <cit> . however, its atpase-negative mutant, vps4m that constitutively associates with endosomal membrane  <cit> , dramatically increased its interaction with cin <dig> . for both vps <dig> and vps4m, their interaction with cin <dig> or cellular co-localization was independent from the coiled-coil domain . in addition, vps4m appeared to be associated with intracellular membrane vesicles, whereas the wild type vps <dig> was mostly cytoplasmic protein .

there was only weak interaction between cin <dig> and chmp4b , although they were co-localized in cells   <cit> . in comparison to the interactions with other escrt proteins , cin85-chmp4b interaction was negligible . little amount chmp4b was co-precipitated with either cin <dig> or cin85-Δcc . on the other hand, chmp2a  and chmp4c , two core members in escrt-iii that are assembled in sequential manner on endosomal membrane, interacted with cin <dig> strongly .

in escrt complex not all the components are in similar position to contact with cin <dig>  <cit> . the domains of cin <dig> involved in the interaction varied with different vps proteins. the interaction of cin <dig> with chmp2a was mediated by the c-terminus containing the proline-rich region, as chmp2a was colocalized with cin <dig> c-terminus, but not n-terminal sh <dig> domains . in contrast, the interaction between cin <dig> and vps <dig> was most likely mediated by the n-terminal sh <dig> domains . vps4m was colocalized with n-terminal sh <dig> domains, but not c-terminus containing the proline-rich region . whatever the differences were in the interactions between cin <dig> and vps proteins, they were all independent from the coiled-coil domain . as cin <dig> with mutations in coiled-coil domain  dissociated from egfr endosomes, their interaction with vps proteins in cytoplasm prevented the vps proteins to interact with egfr-cbl-cin <dig> complex on endosomal membrane. thus, the presence of exogenous cin <dig> mutants interfered with egfr sorting process in endosomes and less egfr was sorted to lysosome for degradation.

discussion
the recruitment of cin <dig> by c-cbl in egfr-cbl complex has been indicated as the initial step for egfr internalization  <cit> . the interaction of cin <dig> with c-cbl is mediated by the sh <dig> domains in cin <dig> and a novel proline-arginine motif present in the distal carboxyl-terminus of cbl  <cit> . interestingly, c-cbl can bind to wild type cin <dig> or cin <dig> fragment containing only the sh <dig> domains , but cannot bind to cin <dig> with coiled-coil domain deletion   <cit> . the sh <dig> domains in cin85-Δcc appear to be blocked for c-cbl interaction, possibly due to the conformational change in cin <dig> lacking the coiled-coil domain  <cit> . however, the detailed mechanism by which the deletion of coiled-coil domain affects cin85-cbl interaction is still not clear. it is possible that without coiled-coil domain the proline-rich region in cin <dig> may engage in auto-interaction with the sh <dig> domains to prevent them to bind c-cbl  <cit> . the difference of cin85-sh <dig> and cin85-Δcc in c-cbl binding leads to different effects on egfr internalization. cin85-sh <dig> has a dominant negative effect on egf stimulated egfr internalization  <cit> , whereas cin85-Δcc exhibits no inhibitory effect on egfr internalization . the interaction of cin85-sh <dig> with c-cbl competes off the binding of functional cin <dig> to egfr-cbl complex. due to the lack of c-terminal endophilin-interacting domains, cin85-sh <dig> cannot tether egfr-cbl complex with endocytic machinery, blocking endophilin-mediated egfr endocytosis. cin85-Δcc, on the other hand, cannot interact with c-cbl and is a bystander to egfr-cbl complex. the endogenous cin <dig> can still be recruited by c-cbl to form egfr-cbl-cin <dig> complex, which then recruits endocytic proteins for receptor internalization. thus, binding of cin <dig> mutant to c-cbl is essential for the dominant negative inhibition of egfr internalization.

the point mutations in the coiled-coil domain minimize the disruptive effect of protein truncation  <cit> . in fact, the point mutation of the basic amino acids in the coiled-coil domain  is sufficient to disrupt cin85-cbl interaction . it not only inhibits cin85-cbl interaction, but also blocks cin85-phosphatidic acid interaction . the results from the mutations of basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain support the electric charge interaction between phosphatidic acid and cin <dig> . k <dig>  k <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> out of  <dig> basic amino acids in coiled-coil domain are the most important in phosphatidic acid binding, membrane association and c-cbl interaction . mutation of these four basic amino acids  is sufficient to disrupt every cin <dig> interactions except cin85-endophilin interaction .

the interactions with c-cbl and phosphatidic acid enable cin <dig> to couple egfr endocytic complex with fusible membrane. the results from study of phospholipase d activation and egfr endocytosis support this kind of association, since egf stimulation induces the activation of phospholipase d as well as egfr internalization  <cit> . phosphatidic acid is generated by phospholipase d in response to egf or other growth factors  <cit> . the activation of phospholipase d increases phosphatidic acid concentration in plasma membrane, while the stimulation of egfr triggers the c-cbl binding to initiate the endocytic complex formation  <cit> . by bridging these two events, cin <dig> facilitates the endocytic complex formation at membrane area enriched with fusogenic lipid.

reports have shown that knockdown of cin <dig> by rna interference has no significant effect on egfr internalization, but rather delays the degradation of internalized egfr  <cit> . it is further identified that the internalized egfr is recycled rather than degraded in cin85-depleted cells  <cit> . depletion of cin <dig> shifts the trafficking of internalized egfr from the degradative to the recycling pathway. it seems to be that cin <dig> is required for the sorting of the internalized egfr. and cin <dig> independent endocytic pathways are involved in egfr internalization in cin85-depleted cells.

after egfr internalization, cin <dig>  associated to egfr-cbl complex, appears on endosomal membrane . its interaction with escrt components will facilitate the assembly of escrt on endosomal membrane . cin <dig> mutants  that do not bind to c-cbl or phosphatidic acid lose their ability to associate with egfr-positive endosomes . these mutants, however, can still interact with escrt components in cytoplasm, equivalent to depleting escrt components for assembly on endosomal membrane and resulting in the inhibition of egfr sorting for degradation . similar result has been obtained by knocking down escrt protein. for example, the depletion of chmp <dig>  in mammalian cells severely inhibits egfr degradation, but the termination of egfr membrane signal remains unaffected  <cit> .as an adaptor protein, cin <dig> acts as a mediator in egfr endocytosis and sorting process. its ability to interact with multiple proteins and fusogenic lipid also makes cin <dig> a mediator between proteins and lipid. membrane receptor endocytosis, sorting and degradation are events of coordinated protein and membrane interactions. cin <dig> appears to be an important match-maker in these events .

CONCLUSIONS
during egfr endocytosis, cin <dig> tethers egfr, phosphatidic acid and clathrin-coated pits to facilitate the receptor internalization. the interaction of cin <dig> with egfr-cbl complex and phosphatidic acid targeted the internalized proteins to membrane areas enriched with fusogenic lipid. the coiled-coil domain, especially the basic amino acids in the domain, is the key regulatory element for the interactions of cin <dig> with egfr-cbl as well as phosphatidic acid. after endocytosis, cin <dig> in association with egfr-cbl complex on endosomal membrane recruits several escrt components to endosome for escrt assembly. then the escrt complex on endosomal membrane induces the formation of multi-vesicular bodies to sort the internalized receptor for degradation or recycling.
