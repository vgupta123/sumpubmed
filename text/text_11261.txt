BACKGROUND
sexual reproduction in organisms with internal fertilization is known to be mediated by a series of molecular interactions between the male ejaculate and female reproductive factors  <cit> . since these interactions are fundamental to fertilization and, thus, for organismal fitness, molecular coevolution has been suggested to arise between male components and interacting female proteins  <cit> . while rapid evolution driven by positive selection has been extensively documented in reproductive proteins from a number of organisms in which multiple matings occur , studies in monandrous species have been so far neglected, as it has been argued that low divergence levels should be expected because of the reduced extent of sexual selection  and/or sexual conflict   <cit> .

in anopheles gambiae sensu stricto , the major malaria vector species in sub-saharan africa, females mate a single time during their lifetime, after which they become refractory to further copulation. multiple matings in natural populations of a. gambiae s.s. occur in a small percentage of individuals  and may be caused by the incomplete transfer of male seminal secretions  <cit> . this species belongs to the a. gambiae complex which includes other six morphologically indistinguishable allied species and two incipient m and s molecular forms within a. gambiae s.s.  <cit> . only few data on the frequency of multiple matings in natural populations are available for these closely related taxa of a. gambiae s.s.   <cit> , however, in general, females of the a. gambiae species complex are believed to be monandrous. although the molecular triggers of female refractoriness to multiple copulations are not yet known, it has been observed that transfer of male seminal secretions is essential for modulating a. gambiae s.s. female post-mating physiology and behavior  <cit> . seminal secretions produced in the male accessory glands  are transferred to the female atrium  during copulation in the form of a gelatinous 'mating plug', which is digested within  <dig> hours after copulation  <cit> . recent studies showed that the mating plug is not an efficient physical barrier to re-insemination, but it is an essential reproductive feature in a. gambiae s.s., as its formation and transfer are necessary to ensure correct sperm storage by the female  <cit> . moreover, recent data strongly points to a key role of atrial proteolytic enzymes in plug digestion: in fact i) these proteases are expressed at high levels in the virgin atrium and considerably down-regulated by  <dig> hours after mating  <cit>  when the mating plug is mostly digested, and ii) some of them were detected by mass spectrometry analysis on mating plug samples dissected from freshly mated females  <cit> .

in this study we examined the patterns of molecular evolution of three female-expressed serine proteases that are encoded by three genes  clustered on chromosome 2l in the a. gambiae genome . these are amongst the a. gambiae s.s. genes most strongly down-regulated by mating: agap <dig> and agap <dig> are exclusively expressed in the atrium and are associated with the mating plug  <cit> , whereas agap <dig> is predominantly expressed in the sperm storage organ, the spermatheca  <cit> . these proteolytic enzymes may therefore play a role in mating plug digestion and/or other reproductive processes important for mosquito fertility.

our main interest was to highlight signatures of adaptive evolution in these  <dig> serine protease genes within the well-defined cryptic and incipient  species of the a. gambiae complex. in fact, there is a considerable intrinsic value in studying the role of natural selection in genes controlling reproduction in the most important malaria vectors in sub-saharan africa, as a better knowledge of the still largely unknown genetic bases of their post-mating physiological and behavioral responses could open perspectives for the development of novel tools to manipulate their fertility and fecundity. in addition, the recently radiated a. gambiae species represent an interesting model to study the adaptive evolution of genes potentially involved in the build-up of reproductive isolating barriers. however, the application of selection-inference methods in closely related taxa, such as those of the a. gambiae complex, imposes some limitations and a critical evaluation of the results  <cit> . thus, to provide the best possible interpretation of the inferred positive selected sites and to corroborate their possible functional significance, these were mapped on the reconstructed 3d models of the three serine proteases.

overall, our results stimulate further studies to elucidate the role of this gene family in determining the reproductive success of a. gambiae taxa and allow to speculate on the relative importance of selective forces underlying the evolution of post-mating characters by comparing the observed patterns with those available for polyandrous organisms.

RESULTS
sequencing data
partial sequences of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp were obtained for the coding regions of agap <dig> , agap <dig>  and agap <dig> , respectively . furthermore, under the same pcr conditions used for the amplification of agap <dig>  we identified a novel paralog, not yet annotated in the a. gambiae genome. this paralog is similar to agap <dig> but characterised by a  <dig> bp insertion of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element  in the third intron . this inserted element is  <dig> % at-rich and forms a putative stable secondary structure, as characteristic of the ta-i-α-ag mite family  <cit> . because of these features, the mite insertion represented a difficult template for amplification and, despite several efforts, we failed to optimize pcr/sequencing protocols. however, we were able to obtain  <dig> sequences for  <dig> out of the  <dig> analysed species of the a. gambiae complex. fish experiments  performed on a. gambiae, a. arabiensis and a. merus chromosomes using a probe binding to the common sequences  of both agap <dig> and the novel copy revealed a single signal in subdivision 21e of the 2l chromosome arm. the same result was obtained using an additional probe. overall, these results suggest that the novel paralog is placed in the same chromosomal division  of the other three genes  in a. gambiae and in all examined species of the a. gambiae complex, indicating that a tandem gene duplication occurred in this specific genomic region.

divergence, polymorphisms and gene tree inferences
divergence  among the species of the a. gambiae complex are reported below for each gene and summarized in table  <dig> . bayesian gene trees reconstructed from the coding regions of each gene are depicted in figure  <dig>  in general, we found that a. merus and a. melas were more frequently included in monophyletic clusters, whereas a. gambiae m- and s- molecular forms  shared many alleles at all loci. henceforth a. gambiae s.s. was considered as a single taxonomic unit in some of our subsequent analyses. the results obtained are reported below for each gene analysed.

agap005194: on average,  <dig> segregating sites were found in the coding region of this gene  and  <dig> out  <dig>  amino acid positions were variable. the average nucleotide diversity  was  <dig> . out of the  <dig> sequences obtained,  <dig> different alleles were found. the highest haplotype diversity  was found in a. gambiae s-form  and in a. arabiensis , whereas the lowest value was detected in a. quadriannulatus . π within species/forms ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at synonymous  and nonsynonymous  sites, respectively . dxy ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with the highest values of divergence found in pairwise comparisons with a. merus . the phylogenetic tree based on the hky+i+g  model was not fully resolved : most species were included in non-monophyletic assemblages , with the exception of a. merus . this species clustered in a separated clade , although embedded in a larger clade also including individuals from other species.

agap005195: a total of  <dig> segregating sites were found in the coding region of this gene , and  <dig> out  <dig>  amino acid sites were variable. the average π was  <dig> . out of the  <dig> allele sequences obtained,  <dig> haplotypes were found. the highest and the lowest hd values were found in a. gambiae  and a. melas , respectively. species/forms π ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . a null value of πs was found in a. merus , whereas the highest value πs was observed in a. gambiae m-form . the lowest value of πa was scored in a. melas  and the highest in a. gambiae  . dxy ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . in the phylogenetic tree based on the hky+i+g model , alleles of a. melas and a. merus are grouped in two monophyletic clades  that are clustered together . a. quadriannulatus alleles are also grouped together in a single clade , but embedded in a larger clade where a. gambiae and a. arabiensis alleles are mixed.

agap005196: a total of  <dig> segregating sites were found in the coding region in this gene , and  <dig> out  <dig>  amino acid sites were variable. the average π was  <dig> . out of the  <dig> allele sequences,  <dig> haplotypes were found. the highest and lowest hd values were found in a. gambiae  and a. merus , respectively. species/forms π ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  ; πs ranged from a null value  to  <dig>   and πa from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . dxy ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . in the bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction based on the hky+i  model, two major groups were strongly separated and supported at their nodes: one group  includes all a. gambiae alleles and most of a. arabiensis + a. quadriannulatus alleles. the second clade  includes all alleles of a. melas and a. merus,  <dig> a. arabiensis alleles  and  <dig> a. quadriannulatus alleles . in particular, a. merus  is well separated from a. melas , and alleles of a. arabiensis and a. quadriannulatus are included in the same clade. in the a. gambiae-like group, on the contrary, alleles are not split in species-specific monophyletic groups, although a. gambiae alleles show a quite high level of exclusive ancestry .

dn/ds pairwise comparison and mcdonald-kreitman test
pairwise comparisons of maximum likelihood  estimates  <cit>  of ds and dn are plotted in figure  <dig>  the range of sequence divergence - defined as the expected number of nucleotide substitutions per codon  - is comparable for agap <dig> and agap <dig> , whereas a smaller t range was scored for agap <dig> . in general, a pattern of puryfing selection was observed for agap <dig>  especially at high divergence levels. however, most of a. merus intra-specific comparisons for t <  <dig>  showed ω > >  <dig> , whereas ω was ~  <dig> at  <dig>  <t <  <dig> . in addition, at t <  <dig> , ω > >  <dig> was also scored for several intra-specific comparisons within the a. gambiae s-form and a. arabiensis, and for some inter-specific comparisons. a general pattern of purifying selection  was also observed for agap <dig>  apart from values scored at a low divergence level , the other pairwise comparisons fell in two discrete and strikingly delimitated clusters corresponding to: i) all inter-specific comparisons with a. melas  and, ii) all inter-specific comparisons with a. merus, except for those with a. melas that are already included in the first cluster . since the computed genetic distances are not independent from the data used to estimate dn and ds, it is notable that divergence estimates in most inter-specific pairwise comparisons involving a. merus are inflated for the co-occurence of a high number of replacements and the absence of synonymous substitutions at intra-specific level. in fact, the relationship between ds and genetic distances is linear only when a. merus is not considered , whereas linearity for dn and genetic distances is observed even when computed on the whole dataset . also for this gene, ω is > >  <dig> and increases linearly with different slopes in pairwise comparisons at divergence levels <  <dig> . as already mentioned, a smaller t range was scored for agap <dig> . it is worth to note that ω increases steadily with t in this gene - following a similar trend to that observed for the other two genes in the same range of divergence - and that ω was >  <dig>  in most of inter-specific comparisons involving a. melas.

this relative preponderance of nonsynonymous changes has been also noted in closely related sequences obtained from other taxa  <cit> . as argued by some authors, ω estimates from a set of conspecific sequences are not appropriate to detect patterns of selection, because the observed differences at this level represent segregating polymorphisms as opposed to fixed substitutions  <cit> . this consideration should be also extended to closely related species, whose introgression and/or recent ancestry affect lineage sorting of alleles, so that differences among them might not represent fixation events along independent lineages. this implies that it might be difficult to detect adaptive evolution in a relatively short time after radiation of closely related species, and that fixation of species-specific replacements is likely to be achieved only under strong positive selection  <cit> . because of these limits, for each positive selected site detected by ml approaches  the state of character was carefully examined along the branches of the gene-trees: caution was taken in interpreting the inflated ω at some of these sites solely as an effect of a long-term change in selective pressures, because shared mutations more likely represented ancestral replacement polymorphisms rather than multiple independent substitutions.

results of mcdonald-kreitman tests are shown in table  <dig>  for all genes, the number of replacements exceeded the number of synonymous substitutions at polymorphic sites in almost all pairwise comparisons, although this difference was not significant. the number of fixed synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions among species was very low for agap <dig> and agap <dig>  whereas in agap <dig> a relatively high number of fixed replacements was observed in pairwise comparisons involving a. merus and a. melas. a significant p-value of mk test  was only found for agap <dig> between a. gambiae and a. melas.

recombination detection
the analysis using the gard algorithm and the rdp software did not detect any statistically significant recombinant, or gene conversion among the three serine protease genes.

selection tests using ml approaches 
for agap <dig> and agap <dig>  likelihood ratio tests were significant for both model comparisons  highlighting several sites with ω values higher than  <dig>  these positively selected sites were identified by both neb and beb analyses  . for agap <dig>  four residues  were consistently identified by neb and beb of m <dig> and m <dig> models. the ω ratios at these sites were >  <dig>  in all cases, even when considering the standard errors  of estimates. all hyphy analyses indicated that site  <dig> is evolving under positive selection; fel also identified site  <dig>  while the results of rel were in accordance with those of neb and beb. for agap <dig> seven residues  were identified by beb and neb of m <dig> and m <dig> models. the ω ratios at these sites were ~8- <dig> in all cases, also when considering the s.e. of estimates. fel, slac and rel identified residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as evolving under positive selection. for agap <dig>  none of the comparisons among codon models was significant using paml. slac did not identify sites evolving under positive selection in this gene, whereas fel identified sites  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, the less conservative rel method identified  <dig> positively selected sites for this gene:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>

the branch model tests applied to agap <dig> dataset did not support episodic selection along any branch, whereas it suggested a putative long-term positive selection scenario in a. merus, although the averaged ω value assigned to foreground branches  was not significantly >  <dig> . in agap <dig>  we also tested for alternative hypotheses of selection  in a. merus and a. melas. the branch model applied to branches leading to a. melas and a. merus, respectively, did not support positive selection. a long-term selection scenario, although not significant, showed a better likelihood score  with a mean ω =  <dig>  for the foreground branches of the a. merus clade. however, the branch-site test was highly significant  when applied to the branch leading to the clade grouping a. melas and a. merus, and beb identified one positively selected site . in agap <dig> the branch model detected episodic selection along the branch separating the a. melas-like from the a. gambiae-like groups . the branch model performed using a gene-tree reconstructed after excluding a. arabiensis and a. quadriannulatus from the dataset also detected episodic selection for the branch separating a. gambiae from the other two species . however, in both cases, ω was not significantly >  <dig>  the high ω along the branch separating the a. gambiae- and a. melas- like groups suggests that positive selection has been acting on it; however, the p-value <  <dig>  cannot be directly interpreted as significant due to a lack of a priori specification of the foreground branches. as already pointed out above, this result is probably affected by an overestimation of ω due to the presence of several segregating replacements. in fact, although the presence of four fixed replacements between the two groups  is consistent with the hypothesis of positive selection, other non-synonymous changes are shared at  <dig> out  <dig> sites  among the species/individuals belonging to the two clusters on both sides of the branch. the most parsimonious interpretation is that such replacements represent ancestral polymorphisms rather than multiple independent substitutions in different lineages, and this likely affects the reliability of ω estimates.

the results of the branch-site tests were negative in all cases, except when the branch leading to a. melas was assigned as foreground on the gene tree obtained after excluding a. arabiensis and a. quadriannulatus , although beb failed to identify positive selective sites.

3d models
our analysis indicates that agap <dig>  agap <dig> and agap <dig> are chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, a class of enzymes characterized by the presence of a catalytic triad  and composed by two juxtaposed barrel domains, with the catalytic residues bridging the barrels  <cit> . residues from n to c terminus of the protease polypeptide substrate are usually named pi, ..., p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p1', p2', p3', ..., pj. the cleavable bond is located between p <dig> and p1', p <dig> being the strongest specificity determinant in the majority of the cases. the specificity pocket and the oxyanion hole represent two essential structural features of serine proteases. the former recognizes the side chain of the p <dig> residue, whereas the latter stabilizes the negative charge that develops on the carboxyl oxygen of the substrate.

we analysed the specificity pocket of the three enzymes . it can be noticed that two particular positions in the specificity pocket are strictly conserved in all proteases, namely a glycine in position  <dig>  and an aspartate in position  <dig>  even if the other positions are more variable, a noticeably large hydrophobic residue is present in position  <dig> of all proteases. this suggests that these enzymes may recognize a hydrophobic amino acid in p <dig>  possibly a phenylalanine, which could fit into the pocket . interestingly, agap <dig> displays a bulky aromatic residue  in position  <dig>  whereas in the same position both agap <dig> and agap <dig> have a smaller hydrophobic one  . this difference might in principle correspond to a different substrate preference of agap <dig> with respect to the other two proteases.

we next determined the position on the protease surface of the residues subjected to positive selection . interestingly, most of them lie on the surface area of the protein containing the active site and, even if their geometric distribution is rather different in the three proteases, they surround the active site in two out of three cases. by analyzing the distance distribution of the positive-selected residues from the catalytic serine and their position relatively to the catalytic triad, we observed that  <dig> out of  <dig> residues in agap <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> residues in agap <dig> are within a close distance  . in particular, five sites identified as evolving under selective pressures  are in strategic locations: in fact, sites  <dig> and  <dig> in agap <dig> and sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in agap <dig>  lie on the edge of the specificity pocket . these sites could have an important role in substrate recognition and/or binding. it is worth to note that codon  <dig> of agap <dig> has been identified by the branch-site model as evolving under selective pressures along the branch separating the a. melas and a. merus clade from the other members of the a. gambiae complex. finally, most of the  <dig> positively selected residues identified for agap <dig> appears to be "randomly" distributed in the protein structure .  <dig> of these residues  are close to each other and lie on the same protein face of the catalytic triad  and among them  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are located near the edge of the specificity pocket. however, the putative high level of ancestral replacement polymorphisms could have led to an overestimation of ω by site-models for most of agap <dig> positive selected sites .

immunofluorescence and confocal analysis
to gain further support for the hypothesis that the atrium-expressed proteases are involved in the digestion of the mating plug, we used polyclonal antibodies against agap <dig> in immunofluorescence  experiments on mating plugs dissected from recently mated a. gambiae females. the if experiments verified that indeed this female protease is found on the surface of the plug after mating . moreover, the pattern of agap <dig> on the plug surface closely matched the pattern of plugin, the major plug protein   <cit> . we also confirmed that by  <dig> hours post-mating just some traces of agap <dig> protein are left in the female atrium compared to virgin levels . all together, these data strongly suggest that agap <dig>  is completely dedicated to proteolytic activities related to copulation.

discussion
here we present data on a cluster of  <dig> female lrt-specific serine protease genes suggested to be involved in post-mating processes in a. gambiae s.s. as already shown for other genes with different functions, the reconstruction of the  <dig> gene-trees shows that most species share alleles at all loci, as an effect of introgression and/or retention of ancestral polymorphisms, and that only a. merus and a. melas are placed in monophyletic assemblages . on the other hand, we found an unusually high substitution rate, which contributes mostly to an exceptionally high level of intra-specific polymorphisms, especially at nonsynonymous sites . moreover, while a. gambiae, a. arabiensis, and a. quadriannulatus do not differ for any fixed replacement, a. melas and a. merus diverge from the other species at all loci, showing a high number of fixed substitutions at both synonymous  and nonsynonymous  sites at locus agap <dig> 

the comparisons of different site-models - used to test for the presence of positively selected sites in our codon alignments - indicate that in all  <dig> serine proteases most amino acidic residues  are conserved among the species analysed and that these proteins are overall subjected to purifying selection . however, a number of codons appear to be targeted by positive selective pressures in all genes  and, noteworthy, some of them lie relatively close to the catalytic triad and/or on the edge of the specificity pocket, which is considered to be important for substrate recognition and/or binding .

moreover, lineage-specific tests of adaptive evolution detected events of episodic selection in agap <dig> and agap <dig>  in the former gene, the branch-site models detected episodic selection on lineages that were not detected by branch-models, as expected if positive selection occurs at a few sites in an overall purifying selection background. in particular, codon  <dig> is shown to have evolved under selective pressures along the branch separating the clade grouping a. melas and a. merus from the other members of the a. gambiae complex. these two species are grouped apart also on the basis of other substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  among them, sites  <dig> and  <dig> were also detected by beb analysis of site-model comparisons . it is worth to note that most of these residues are exposed to the solvent and form a sort of semi-circle around the active site , suggesting that this epitope might interact with a peculiar substrate in a. melas and a. merus. it can be hypotesized that this epitope evolved under selective pressures in a common ancestor of these two species, or, alternatively, because of convergent evolution. the latter hypothesis would be consistent with the distant phylogenetic relationship between these two species, as suggested by their chromosomal inversions patterns  <cit> . in addition, we found a. merus-  and a. melas-  specific replacements: among them, residues in position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  on the same protein side of the catalytic triad, while the remaining residues are located in exposed loops in regions far from it . follow up molecular studies will be needed to clarify whether agap <dig> has evolved a different role in a. melas and a. merus as opposed to the other species of the complex.

in agap <dig>  the branch model detected episodic selection along the branch separating the a. melas-like from the a. gambiae-like alleles, and along the branch leading to a. melas. in both cases, the ω assigned to these branches  was not significantly > <dig>  on the contrary, the branch-site test applied to the branch leading to a. melas was statistically significant, but beb failed to identify sites under positive selection. finally, a significant excess of fixed replacements between a. gambiae and a. melas was also detected by the mk-test for this gene .

the interpretation of the results obtained is not straightforward, with particular reference to those from the models of episodic selection. as already mentioned, the occurrence in agap <dig> of relatively high frequencies of nonsynonymous mutations at both intra- and inter-specific levels may affect the interpretation of evidence of episodic selection along the branch leading to a. melas. in addition, although a. melas presents four species-specific amino acid replacements at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , these are shared with some a. arabiensis and a. quadriannulatus individuals, thus revealing again a pattern of incomplete lineage sorting also for this particular haplotype.

increased dn/ds among conspecifics  has been observed in other taxa, and a variety of hypotheses has been suggested to interpret these results under a regime of negative selection: balancing selection, variable population sizes, variable mutation rates, relaxed selective constraints and/or the prevalence of slightly deleterious mutations  <cit> . based on our data, we cannot rule out any of these hypotheses, nor provide an unambiguous explanation for the observed pattern. however, the high level of replacement polymorphisms observed in all the  <dig> serine proteases  suggests that these genes might evolve as a functionally redundant cluster. in fact, duplicated genes with partially or completely overlapping functions may experience relaxed evolutionary constraints that allow them to rapidly explore and eventually fix new advantageous variants  <cit> . indeed, in some drosophila species, female-expressed serine proteases have experienced recurrent events of lineage-specific gene duplications immediately followed by a period of positive selection, indicating neo-functionalization of gene duplicates  <cit> . evidence of recent duplication activity playing a crucial role also in the evolution of anopheles female proteases is provided by the finding of an additional copy of agap <dig> located in the same gene cluster. this previously undetected paralog bears the insertion of a miniature transposable element of the ta-i-α-ag mite family, which is frequently associated with gene introns and putatively affects gene regulation  <cit> . if we assume that the a. gambiae serine-protease cluster is experiencing relaxed evolutionary constraints, the decrease of dn/ds observed only at increasing evolutionary distances in all  <dig> proteases  may simply reflect a lag in removal of slightly-deleterious mutations by purifying selection occurring in the early stages of sequence differentiation. this could, for instance, explain the ω >> <dig> observed for most a. merus intra-specific comparisons in agap <dig> , which could alternatively be interpreted also as the result of long-term positive selective pressures in this species . the latter interpretation is consistent with the observation that some a. merus-specific polymorphic replacements  map close to the catalytic triad , although some of them are also shared with other species . hence, a better knowledge on the functional importance of these non-synonymous changes would be needed to evaluate if balancing selection is maintaining different haplogroups at intermediate frequencies in the a. merus gene pool.

in addition, we cannot exclude that genetic drift caused by long-term small effective population sizes of a. melas and a. merus might have also contributed to determine the observed fixation of species-specific substitutions . indeed, it has been argued by many authors that coalescence processes and demographic fluctuations have differently affected and shaped the population genetic history of members of the a. gambiae complex  <cit> . since πs can be used as an estimator of 4neμ, assuming the same mutation rate  in all lineages, differences at neutral sites at the agap <dig> locus would indicate that a. gambiae and a. arabiensis have experienced larger effective population sizes than a. merus, consistently both with their wider geographic range and their higher levels of shared ancestral polymorphisms . a similar explanation could be applied to the four species-specific replacements found in a. melas at the agap <dig> locus and indeed, under the same assumption, πs would indicate that a. gambiae and a. arabiensis have experienced larger effective population sizes than a. melas .

difficulties in the interpretation of results from selection-tests are mostly due to the unresolved phylogenetic history of the a. gambiae complex, as already argued for genes modulating immune responses to the malaria parasites  <cit> . however, the accurate inferences of the structural models of these proteins allowed us to better evaluate the importance of these putative positive selected residues. it is worth to note that most positive selected residues appear not located "at random" on 3d structures. in particular, the structural models show that agap <dig> and agap <dig> positive selected residues are placed in a relatively large surface area near the catalytic triad and in the specificity pocket . a similar pattern was also observed for duplicated genes encoding several mating-induced female serine proteases of drosophila  <cit> , which are supposed to interact with rapidly evolving accessory gland proteins transferred by males during mating  <cit> . sexual selection and/or conflict due to male-female protein interactions have been considered to be responsible for these patterns in drosophila and to have promoted rapid divergence, which in some cases has been found to be ten-fold higher than in genes expressed in non-reproductive tissues  <cit> . however, in the case of the monandrous species of the a. gambiae complex, sexual selection and/or conflict cannot be convincingly invoked to explain the presence of positive selected sites near the catalytic triad or in the specificity pocket. a more likely explanation could be that the observed pattern is derived from the interaction of the  <dig> female-specific proteases with rapidly evolving substrates or inhibitors that may differently modulate their catalytic activity. this scenario mirrors the rapid evolution of immune-related genes engaged in host-pathogen arms race . indeed, in drosophila females sexually antagonistic interactions at the time of mating activate a number of immune-related genes, which are induced by the transfer of sperm and seminal fluid peptides, rather than by pathogens  <cit> . it has been suggested that this immune response could account for the 'cost of mating', in the form of decreased female lifespan and fecundity  <cit> . although in a. gambiae no significant induction of known immune genes was detected after mating and no cost of mating has ever been reported, some genes encoding immune-like peptides were shown to be strongly upregulated in the female atrium  <cit> . it could be hypothesized that the three serine proteases studied here have a dual role in anopheles fertility: helping the preservation of the female reproductive tract from possible damaging factors transferred during mating, and processing of the mating plug. in effect, a dual role could be hypothesized for agap005194: this protease has been found to respond to bacterial infection  <cit>  and its role in processing the mating plug is confirmed by its localization on the plug surface . given the strong down-regulation of the  <dig> serine proteases at  <dig> h post mating, it is reasonable to speculate that their transcription may be turned down by male-derived factors released during mating plug digestion, thereby reducing the cost of mating and allowing females to entirely divert their energy resources to reproductive processes. this hypothesis would be more consistent with a co-operation between the sexes in optimizing their reproductive success, rather than with an arms race among sexes.

the relaxation in purifying selection provided by the functional redundancy in the cluster would allow the maintenance of high genetic variability, on which positive selection could act to eventually fix novel variants to perform either new or more specific functions   <cit> . in fact, the 3d models highlighted an important structural differentiation in the two atrium-specific proteases agap <dig> and agap <dig> that might have a different substrate preference . this differentiation, due to a bulky aromatic residue  in position  <dig> of agap <dig> respect to a smaller hydrophobic one  in agap <dig> and agap <dig>  is fixed in all species of the a. gambiae complex and thus likely appeared very early during the evolution of the paralogs, probably because of neo-functionalization. the relative high differentiation  and the absence of gene conversion among the three paralogs  indicate that these are not at their very early stages of duplication in the a. gambiae complex. in this context, it would be important to obtain more information on the conservation of gene linkage  for this cluster of functionally related genes in species more distant to those within the a. gambiae complex. interestingly, a comparative study of gene orders between a. gambiae and a. stephensi at ~ <dig> mb resolution did not detect a conserved synteny block for the chromosome region containing these serine protease genes  <cit> . furthermore, the order of these genes was inverted  in a. stephensi because of the accumulation of a large number of fixed inversions during the divergence of the two species. novel data from the ongoing genome sequencing project from  <dig> more anopheles species will provide a better knowledge on the orthology and synteny of these genes and, hopefully, a stable phylogenetic framework to trace the evolution of relevant amino acid substitutions in copies of this gene cluster. these data would also help validating the findings of other 'novelties' such as fixed autapomorphic and synapomorphic replacements located in strategic positions close to the catalytic triad of the  <dig> proteases, which suggests an interaction with factors transferred by males  that may have differently evolved in independent a. gambiae lineages. in addition, the spermatheca-specific protease agap <dig>  because of its relative low divergence among members of the a. gambiae complex, is likely to have appeared more recently than the other copies with functions partially or completely overlapping with those of agap <dig>  indeed, preliminary data show that a number of seminal proteins are transferred to the spermatheca bound on sperm , as it has been shown in drosophila  <cit> . it is possible that agap <dig> is also experiencing relaxed evolutionary constraints that allow the accumulation of mutations not tolerated in the previous selective regime and that might be responsible for its adaptation to substrates present in a novel reproductive tissue . this is consistent with the observation that a. melas-specific sites  <dig> and  <dig> are located nearby the edge of the specificity pocket and might play a role in substrate recognition and/or binding .

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize our results, we found i) an unusually high level of replacement polymorphisms, ii) evidence of a recent gene duplication activity, iii) species/group-specific fixed replacements, iv) sites evolving under long-term and episodic positive selection, v) structural differences among proteases putatively affecting their substrate specificity and, vi) additional evidence of a direct role of these proteases in mating plug digestion.

overall, our data unveil an unexpectedly intricate evolutionary scenario for these  <dig> anopheles female-expressed serine proteases. unfortunately, as already remarked, the intricated phylogenetic history of the a. gambiae complex hinder the interpretation of our results from selection-inference methods. nevertheless, the 3d structure study of these proteins allowed us to highlight a closeness of most of positive selected sites to the catalytic triad and/or to the edge of the specificity pocket. thus, despite the possible presence of false positives in site-based tests of selection, the identification of replacements in amino acid positions that are crucial for the activity of these proteases  encourages further investigation on the role of these residues in substrate recognition or binding in anopheles female serine proteases.

further experimental analyses in the other species of the a. gambiae complex will be also needed to assess whether the patterns of evolution observed for these proteins might correlate to diverse biological functions. if a relevant role of the  <dig> serine proteases in the reproductive success of a. gambiae species will be highlighted, this would open perspectives for the development of innovative strategies aimed at limiting the fertility of these mosquitoes, and ultimately contribute to control malaria transmission.
