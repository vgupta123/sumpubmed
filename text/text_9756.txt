BACKGROUND
nuclear factor kappa-b  is well conserved, ubiquitously expressed, and a pivotal regulator of immune response, inflammation and cell survival  <cit> . dysregulation of nf-κb signaling is associated with numerous human diseases ranging from cancer to crohn's disease  <cit> , underscoring the role of nf-κb in physiological processes. since the discovery of nf-κb twenty-six years ago  <cit> , much insight has been gained into the regulation of its signaling and many pathway components have been characterized  <cit> .

the nf-κb transcription factor is a dimer composed of structurally related rel family proteins  <cit> . of these, the p50-p <dig> nf-κb heterodimer is best characterized. the cytokine tumor necrosis factor  is a strong inducer of p50-p65/nf-κb signaling  <cit> . upon binding to cell surface receptors, tnf initiates a signaling cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of i-kappab  kinase  -a large cytoplasmic multi-protein complex  <cit> . ikk in turn phosphorylates iκb-α bound to nf-κb. this results in proteasomal degradation of iκb-α, freeing nf-κb to translocate into the nucleus and activate its targets  <cit> . many of these targets include activators  and inhibitors ) of nf-κb signaling, hence providing context specific feedback regulation.

micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rnas  that bind to target mrnas and promote transcript degradation and/or inhibit translation  <cit> . studies suggest that mirnas are common components of signal transduction pathways, conferring robustness to gene expression and feedback to cellular networks  <cit> . several mirnas are known to regulate nf-κb signaling  <cit> . the earliest example is mir- <dig>  an inhibitor of toll-like receptor  mediated nf-κb signaling  <cit> . another example, the mir- <dig> family, promotes nf-κb signaling by targeting tnf alpha-induced protein  <dig> , an inhibitor of nf-κb signaling  <cit> . further exemplifying the complexity of regulation, mir- <dig> promotes nf-κb signaling via the pten/akt pathway in mcf-10a cells  <cit>  but inhibits lipopolysacharride  mediated nf-κb signaling in tlr <dig> expressing hek <dig> cells  <cit> . in the above examples, the mirnas are themselves direct  or indirect  targets of nf-κb, suggesting that feedback regulation is common  <cit> .

in this study, we sought to systematically characterize the role of mirnas in nf-κb signaling using high-throughput cell based screening. we confirmed previously known regulators and identified novel candidates. further, we derived likely targets for these hits by incorporating other high-throughput/computational datasets. lastly, we characterized the top hits, mir-517a/c, identified their target, and explored the relationship between their impact on nf-κb signaling and their regulation of apoptosis in the human embryonic kidney cell line hek <dig> and the osteosarcoma cell line u- <dig> os.

RESULTS
genome-wide mirna screen identifies regulators of nf-κb signaling
to identify mirnas involved in the regulation of nf-κb signaling, we transfected hek <dig> cells stably expressing a nf-κb responsive luciferase reporter  with a library of  <dig> mirna mimics  in duplicate . seventy-two hours post-transfection, the cells were treated with tnf  or vehicle control  for  <dig>  hours. luminescence was then measured from each well . boxplots of the luminescence values for each screen are shown in figure 1b. the addition of tnf to the cells induced the average plate-wide reporter activity approximately 400-fold . z-scores were calculated from the luminescence values  and were highly replicable for the -tnf  and +tnf  screens . hits from the screens were those mirnas that differentially regulated the reporter  relative to the plate median. at a p-value cutoff of  <dig>  there were  <dig>  = 18%) and  <dig>  hits in the -tnf and + tnf screens, respectively . two of these, mir- <dig> and mir-452*, were hits in both screens.

putative functional targets of mirnas derived from overlap of prediction data and genome-wide cdna screen
in a previous genome-wide cdna screen for regulators of nf-κb signaling, we identified  <dig> activators and  <dig> repressors  <cit> . to identify functional targets of the mirna hits in our screen, we compared regulators from the cdna screen with predicted mirna targets. the predictions were generated with code from targetscan  <dig>   <cit> . for mirnas that activated signaling in our screen, we took the intersection of predicted targets and negative regulators from the cdna screen . conversely, for mirnas that repressed signaling, we took the overlap between predicted targets and activators from the cdna screen . we obtained several candidate genes for each of the mirnas with the exception of mir-517a/c . this was due in part to the smaller number of total predicted targets for mir-517a/c compared to the other mirnas . to obtain high confidence functional targets for each of the mirnas, we set a cutoff of two median absolute deviations  from the median prediction score of all mirna-mrna interactions . the prediction score, or context score , is the sum of multiple feature scores characterizing the proposed mirna-mrna interaction  <cit> . the more negative the cs, the more favorable the predicted interaction. the resulting mirnas and their targets are listed in table  <dig>  five of the  <dig> mirna repressors and  <dig> of the  <dig> mirna activators had one or more predicted targets meeting the cutoff. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were particularly noteworthy. they both repressed nf-κb signaling in our screen and were predicted to target rela/p <dig>  a core pathway component and a positive regulator in the cdna screen . also, mir-452*, an activator in our screen, was predicted to target nfkbie, a repressor of nf-κb signaling. hence, these results suggest that the integration of data from genome-wide cdna screens and computational target predictions may help in identifying functional mirna targets.

secondary screen confirms top hits
next, we selected representative mirnas for secondary screening: those that activated the reporter in the -tnf screen , inhibited the reporter in the +tnf screen , or activated the reporter in both screens . the mir- <dig> family consists of three highly homologous members, mir-517a, mir-517b, and mir-517c, yet intriguingly, mir-517b, was not a hit in the primary screen. nonetheless, we included mir-517b in the secondary screen to eliminate the possibility that it was a false-negative. in the secondary screen, the mirnas were co-transfected with a constitutively expressed renilla reporter plasmid. this served as a control for transfection efficiency and background effects caused by the mirnas. corroborating the primary screen results, mir-517a and mir-517c were potent activators  of the reporter in the absence of tnf, but did not potentiate tnf induced reporter activity . in fact, there was a small but significant  reduction in reporter activity in the mir-517c transfected cells stimulated with tnf. overexpression of mir-517b caused a relatively small increase in reporter activity  and hence, was deemed a true-negative. on the other hand, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> overexpression significantly inhibited tnf induced reporter activity by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold , respectively. surprisingly, mir- <dig> induced basal reporter activity by  <dig> -fold . lastly, mir- <dig> potentiated signaling in both the -tnf  and +tnf  conditions relative to the respective negative controls . in all, the hits from our initial screen were validated in the secondary screen.

effect of mir- <dig> family on endogenous nf-κb targets and signaling components
we decided to follow up on the mir- <dig> family with additional experiments for several reasons: 1) mirnas typically have a moderate impact on their targets yet mir-517a/c were potent activators of reporter activity in the absence of any added stimulus; 2) we were intrigued that mir-517b did not activate signaling despite extensive sequence similarity to mir-517a/c; and 3) a previous proteomics study by luo et al. suggested mir-517a involvement in mapk and tnf signaling in bewo cells  <cit> .

the mir- <dig> family is located in a large, primate-specific mirna cluster on human chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . the mir- <dig> mirnas share extensive sequence homology. mir-517a and mir-517c differ by one nucleotide at position  <dig>  and mir-517b is shifted by one nucleotide relative to mir-517a . this shift in mir-517b also results in a shifted seed sequence . the seed sequence of the mirna  is a primary determinant of functional interaction between a mirna and its target. hence, the shift in the mir-517b seed likely alters target interaction relative to mir-517a/c. nonetheless, it was unexpected to see such a large difference between mir-517a/c and mir-517b in our reporter assays.

next, we wanted to test the effect of the mir- <dig> mirnas on endogenous nf-κb targets. we transfected hek <dig> cells with the mir- <dig> mimics and measured the expression of il <dig> and tnf mrna in unstimulated cells  and in cells stimulated with tnf for three hours . in unstimulated cells, mir-517a/c strongly induced il <dig>  and tnf  expression while mir-517b had only a modest effect , confirming the reporter results . however, in cells treated with tnf, there was no significant change in il <dig> and tnf expression in cells transfected with the mir- <dig> mimics relative to the negative control . to verify that mir-517a/c were acting through the nf-κb pathway, we co-transfected the mimics with one of two independent small interfering rnas  against the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb . both sirnas reduced mir-517a/c induced expression of il <dig> and tnf at least 6-fold . lastly, the nuclear translocation of p <dig> and the proteasomal degradation of iκb-α are indicative of nf-κb activation. hence, we evaluated the effect of mir-517a/c on the subcellular localization and expression of p <dig> and iκb-α in hek <dig> cells. mir-517a/c, but not mir-517b, increased nuclear p <dig> and decreased cytoplasmic iκb-α expression relative to the negative control . further, there was increased nf-κb dna binding activity in the nuclear extracts of cells transfected with mir-517a and mir-517c, but not mir-517b as measured with elisa . in all, these results confirmed the primary and secondary screen data that mir-517a/c, and not mir-517b, were potent activators of nf-κb signaling.

to confirm that the effects of mir-517a/c on nf-κb signaling were not restricted to hek <dig> cells, we also tested primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells . similarly, mir-517a/c increased target gene expression  in a p65-dependent manner and increased p <dig> nuclear translocation .

tnip <dig> is a direct functional target of mir-517a/c
mirnas function primarily by down-regulating the expression of their targets. therefore, we deduced the likely target of mir-517a/c was an inhibitor of nf-κb signaling. we searched the targetscan predictions for known repressors. tnip <dig>  also known as a20-binding inhibitor of nf-κb activation , was one of the top predicted targets. tnip <dig> binds to tnfaip <dig>  a ubiquitin-editing enzyme, and together they inhibit ripk dependent nf-κb signaling  <cit> . a clone for the mouse tnip <dig> gene was present in the cdna library used for the analysis in figure 2; however, it did not pass the multiple stages of filtering to be included in the final list of nf-κb modulators  <cit> . to test if tnip <dig> was indeed a functional target of mir-517a/c, we measured its protein levels in hek <dig> cells transfected with the mirna mimics. both mir-517a and mir-517c, but not mir-517b, potently reduced tnip <dig> protein levels . next, we tested if sirnas targeting tnip <dig> could phenocopy mir-517a/c. indeed, two independent sirnas significantly increased endogenous expression of il <dig> and tnf in hek <dig> cells . finally, we hypothesized that overexpression of tnip <dig> would block the effect of mir-517a/c. we tested this by creating a tnip <dig> cdna construct with a truncated 3'utr lacking the mir-517a/c target site. this ensured that the effects we saw were due to the activity of tnip <dig> protein and not due to competition for mir-517a/c binding. expression of tnip <dig> from the construct was confirmed via western blot . co-transfection of the tnip <dig> construct with the mirna mimics reduced mir-517a/c-induced expression of il <dig> and tnf in hek <dig> cells .

next, we took a closer look at the genomic region corresponding to the mir-517a/c binding site in tnip <dig>  this revealed two interesting features. first, the target site is poorly conserved, with notable differences in the mouse and rat genomes . secondly, a snp  is located in the target site corresponding to the third position of the mirna seed . the minor allele  results in a g-u wobble base pair, possibly affecting mirna-target interaction . to test the functional consequence of this snp as well as demonstrate direct interaction between mir-517a/c and tnip <dig>  we cloned sequences containing the major and minor alleles immediately downstream of a firefly luciferase reporter. the same plasmid also expressed renilla luciferase from a separate constitutive promoter, which was used as a control for transfection efficiency. mir-517a and mir-517c repressed the reporter containing the major allele variant but had no effect on the empty vector . mir-517b also inhibited reporter activity, but to a lesser extent . the repression by the mir- <dig> mirnas was significantly alleviated in the minor allele reporter . these results suggested that mir-517a/c interact directly with tnip <dig> and that the minor allele of snp rs <dig> decreases mirna-target interaction and consequently mir-517a/c mediated repression of tnip <dig> 

lastly, given that tnip <dig> is a tnf regulated gene  <cit>  and mirnas are common in feedback regulation, we hypothesized that nf-κb regulates mir-517a/c which in turn activates the pathway through knockdown of tnip <dig>  to test this we treated hek <dig> cells with tnf over time and measured expression of tnip <dig> mrna and mir-517a/c. while there was a significant increase in tnip <dig> expression, mir-517a/c expression was not significantly changed .

mir-517a/c induce apoptosis in hek <dig> and u- <dig> os cells
mir-517a/c activation has been shown to promote cell survival and induce oncogenesis  <cit> . surprisingly, we observed extensive cell death in an immortalized cell line, hek <dig>  and an osteosarcoma cell line, u- <dig> os, transfected with mir-517a/c . we measured caspase- <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  activity in cells transfected with mir-517a/c using the caspase-glo 3/ <dig> luminescence assay. mir-517a/c increased casp-3/ <dig> activity 16-fold in hek- <dig> cells and 8-fold in u- <dig> os cells relative to the negative control . to confirm the assay results, we tested the effect of mir-517a/c on the cleavage of poly  polymerase  <dig> , an endogenous casp <dig> target. mir-517a/c induced cleavage of full length parp <dig> while no cleaved parp <dig> was observed in lysates of control cells . together, these results suggested that mir-517a/c induced apoptosis in hek <dig> and u- <dig> os cells.

next, we tested if mir-517a/c induced apoptosis was a result of tnip <dig> knockdown. tnip <dig> promotes cell survival and is essential for development. mice lacking tnip <dig> have extensive tnf induced apoptosis in the liver and few are born live  <cit> . similar to mir-517a/c, sirna mediated knockdown of tnip <dig> increased cell death in hek  <dig> cells . also, tnip <dig> knockdown increased casp-3/ <dig> activity  and cleavage of parp <dig> . together, these results suggested that knockdown of tnip <dig> contributes to the apoptosis inducing activity of mir-517a/c.

finally, we questioned whether the apoptosis inducing effects of mir-517a/c were specific to cancer-derived/immortalized cell lines. we transfected primary huvecs with mir-517a/c and, similar to hek <dig> and u2-os cells, we observed increased cell death and casp-3/ <dig> activity . hence, these results suggest that mir-517a/c can induce apoptosis in primary and immortalized cells.

discussion
in this study, we identified  <dig> mirnas that regulated basal or tnf-induced nf-κb signaling using high-throughput cell-based screening. some of these hits are known regulators or direct targets of nf-κb. mir- <dig>  mir-125b and mir- <dig> are direct nf-κb targets and were hits in our screen  <cit> . further, mir-125b was recently shown to promote nf-κb signaling by targeting tnfaip <dig>  <cit> . likewise, mir- <dig> was recently shown to inhibit signaling by targeting nf-Κb1/p <dig>  <cit> . both of these findings are consistent with our screening data and suggest mir-125b and mir- <dig> are feedback regulators of nf-κb signaling. also, studies by jiang et al. suggest mir-30e-3p promotes nf-κb signaling by targeting the inhibitor iκb-α  <cit> . while mir-30e-3p did not meet the cutoff in our +tnf screen , the related mir-30a-3p was a hit , activating reporter activity. in all, these results confirmed that our primary screen effectively identified known mirna regulators of nf-κb signaling.

during the preparation of this study, to our knowledge two other groups published screens investigating the role of mirnas in nf-κb signaling  <cit> . a comparison of the experimental methods is detailed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the first by lu et al. looked at the effects of mirnas on basal nf-κb reporter activity   <cit> . they found mir-301a was the strongest inducer  and that it functioned by targeting nfkb repressing factor . mir-301a was not a hit in our screen . however, the related family members mir-130a and mir-130b  both increased basal reporter activity by  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold , respectively . further, mir-130a was a hit in the +tnf screen with a  <dig> -fold increase . hence, our results are in agreement with the lu et al. study suggesting that the mir-301/mir- <dig> family positively regulates nf-κb signaling. however, none of the activators confirmed in our secondary screen  were hits in the lu et al. study.

in the second study by keklikoglou et al., the authors examined the effect of mirnas on tnf-induced nf-κb reporter activity  <cit> . they identified  <dig> mirna families as hits . upon initial evaluation, none of these were hits in our screen. we then relaxed our p-value cutoff from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and three mirna families overlapped between the screens: mir-27ab, let-7/mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  interestingly, members of the mir- <dig> family consistently upregulated the reporter in the keklikoglou et al. study, while all four members downregulated reporter activity in our study to varying degrees . our results are consistent with a recent study by sun et al. demonstrating mir-181b inhibition of nf-κb through importin-α <dig>  <cit> . further, mir-517a/c were identified as negative regulators in the keklikoglou screen. mir-517a/c were potent activators in our -tnf screen and were not hits in our +tnf screen . however, as noted before, we did observe a slight decrease in reporter activity by mir-517c in the secondary screen . interestingly, none of the validated hits from our +tnf secondary screen  were hits in the keklikoglou et al. study.

we believe the differences in the screen results largely stem from methodological and technical differences . all three studies used different nf-κb reporters that were transiently or stably expressed in hek293/293ft cells. a critical factor may be the sensitivity and specificity of these reporters. also, the duration of transfection was  <dig> hours in our screen, but  <dig> hours in the lu and keklikoglou screens. during the optimization of our screen, we found that this longer transfection period was necessary for the optimal impact of our positive controls on reporter activity . however, the optimal transfection time depends on several factors including the abundance and half-life of the target proteins as well as the response kinetics of the reporter assay. in all, however, the differences between the screens are not unusual. such discordance is also found in large rnai screens  <cit> . this highlights the importance of replication studies and suggests that follow-up of top hits from all screens is necessary to understand fully the roles of diverse mirnas in nf-κb signaling.

determining the mechanism of mirna action by finding their functional targets is challenging. this problem is two-fold. first, identify the targets, which can number in the hundreds, and second, from these, identify the ones mediating the effect of the mirna. this can be limited by a lack of preexisting knowledge of the pathway of interest. also, exhaustively testing the candidates can be unfeasible . we addressed this problem by integrating computational predictions from targetscan and data from our genome-wide cdna screen for regulators of nf-κb signaling  <cit> . with this method, we derived high confidence candidate targets for all the mirnas with the exception of mir-517a/c. this was likely because mir-517a/c had about eight times fewer predicted targets than the other mirnas . for future studies, the target list from our analysis has to be validated experimentally. a few high-throughput experimental methodologies for evaluating mirna targets have been successfully implemented. these include high-throughput sequencing of rnas isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation , photoactivatable-ribonucleoside enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation , ribosome profiling, and microarray analysis of cells or tissues with perturbed mirna states  <cit> . these datasets are becoming available for more mirnas and their integration into functional annotation pipelines, such as the one in our study, will be highly informative in identifying functional mirna-mrna interactions.

for follow up studies, we focused on the role of primate specific mir-517a and mir-517c as potent inducers of nf-κb signaling. we identified tnip <dig>  an inhibitor of nf-κb, as a direct target gene. interestingly, mir-517b was not a hit in our screen despite extensive homology to mir-517a/c . also, mir-517b did not phenocopy mir-517a/c in secondary screens  or knockdown tnip <dig> protein expression . these differences were likely due to a single nucleotide shift in the mir-517b mature sequence relative to mir-517a/c . according to targetscan predictions  <cit> , this shift results in base-pairing between tnip <dig> and nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> of mir-517b as opposed to nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> in mir-517a/c-the latter resulting in a more favorable mirna-target interaction. this result highlights the importance of the mirna seed in mediating mirna-target interactions and suggests caution in extrapolating the function of individual mirnas to their family members, particularly when their seed regions differ. interestingly, during the preparation of this study we examined sequence reads of the mir-517b locus from mirbase  <cit> , the central repository for mirna sequences, and found a variant identical to mir-517a. this suggests that the shifted variant is either a result of read errors or a true 5' isomir-the likes of which have been demonstrated in multiple species  <cit> . we informed the curators of mirbase, and the unshifted sequence  is the new reference for mir-517b  as of mirbase v <dig> 

while knockdown of tnip <dig> was sufficient to induce expression of tnf and il <dig> as much as 18- and 56-fold, respectively , mir-517a/c were more potent inducers . also, overexpression of tnip <dig> did not completely block mir-517a/c induced expression of tnf and il <dig>  this suggests that the effect of mir-517a/c on nf-κb signaling may be mediated by other genes in the pathway in addition to tnip <dig>  this is consistent with numerous studies suggesting that mirnas regulate cellular pathways by targeting multiple components  <cit> . further studies are needed to elucidate additional mir-517a/c targets. the tnip <dig> 3'utr harbors a functional snp in the mir-517a/c binding site. snps are the most common form of human polymorphisms with millions validated in the national center for biotechnology information 's dbsnp. here, we show that the minor allele of snp rs <dig>  creates a g-u base pair between mir-517a/c and tnip <dig> that disrupts binding, resulting in reduced knockdown of tnip <dig>  this is consistent with studies demonstrating the deleterious effect of g-u base pairing between a mirna's seed and target mrna  <cit> . there are currently no reported phenotypes associated with rs <dig>  but future studies may shed light on the potential consequence of this snp and the broader biological function of mir-517a/c.

an oncogenic role for mir-517a has been suggested in liver and brain tumors  <cit> . given mir-517a/c activated nf-κb signaling in our screen, this is consistent with the well-established anti-apoptotic role of nf-κb  <cit> . however, we found mir-517a/c induced apoptosis in the immortalized cell line hek <dig>  in the osteosarcoma cell line u- <dig> os and in primary huvecs. corroborating our results, a study by yoshitomi et al. found mir-517a induced apoptosis in the bladder cancer cell lines t <dig> and boy  <cit> . also, interestingly, na et al. recently found mir-517a down-regulated in the placenta of patients with complete hydatidiform moles-a condition characterized by increased trophoblast proliferation  <cit> . hence, our results suggest that the knockdown of tnip <dig> by mir-517a/c may both activate nf-κb signaling and repress its anti-apoptotic activity. also, these conflicting functions of mir-517a/c may reflect the complex role of nf-κb in the regulation of cell survival. in some cases, nf-κb can promote apoptosis in a context and cell type-specific manner  <cit> . additional studies are needed to understand how survival signals differ in various cell types in response to mir-517a/c and the role nf-κb may play in this process. as mir-517a/c are suppressed in most cell/tissue types, their reported activation by demethylating drugs, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine   <cit>  may have therapeutic value in the treatment of certain cancers.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a valuable resource for the functional annotation of mirnas in the nf-κb pathway. our data suggest that mirnas are common regulators. while additional studies are needed to identify the functional targets of these mirnas, we provide a starting list of likely candidates by integrating target predictions and cdna screening data. lastly, we conclude that mir-517a/c are pro-apoptotic and potent activators of nf-κb that function at least in part through tnip <dig>
