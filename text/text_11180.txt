BACKGROUND
infection of the uterus has a significant impact on the profitability of the dairy industry because of lowered reproductive efficiency, decreased milk production, and increased costs associated with treatment and culling of animals due to infertility  <cit> . uterine infections in dairy cows are associated with predisposing factors including calving difficulty, retained placenta, compromised immune status and parity, along with the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms in the reproductive tract  <cit> . immediately after calving, the dilated state of the cervix allows microorganisms from the environment, cow’s skin, and fecal material to enter through the vagina into the uterus and initiate inflammation of the endometrium, which is highly associated with infertility  <cit> . metritis associated bacteria have been classified as pathogens, potential pathogens, or opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . recognised uterine pathogens that are associated with severe endometrial inflammation and clinical endometritis include escherichia coli, arcanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenica and proteus species  <cit> . williams et al.  <cit>  considered high cell counts of e. coli as the basis for the onset of uterine infection.

in a healthy female reproductive tract of humans, mice, or monkeys, lactobacilli are among the predominant organisms  <cit> . vaginal lactobacilli inhibit the growth of genitourinary pathogenic micro-organisms through mechanisms of competitive exclusion of pathogens, stimulation of the host immune system, and production of specific antibacterial compounds such as acetic and lactic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . a contribution of bacteriocin production by vaginal probiotics to probiotic activity has not been demonstrated experimentally, but formation of the bacteriocin abp <dig> by lactobacillus salivarius uc <dig> conferred resistance to infection by listeria monocytogenes in mice  <cit> .

the microbial flora of a healthy bovine reproductive tract consists of a combination of aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic microorganisms. lactobacilli were found to be present in low numbers in the bovine vaginal microbiota  <cit> ; additionally, enterobacteriaceae are among the dominant populations  <cit> . however, alterations in the vaginal microbiota composition in the first weeks after parturition, i.e. the time during which metritis develops, remain poorly documented. the aim of our study is to characterize the vaginal microbiota of both healthy pregnant and infected post-partum cows by culture-dependent analysis. in addition, retrospective culture independent quantitative pcr  analysis was used to characterize the vaginal microbiota of metritic cows two weeks before and two weeks calving. isolates were studied with regards to shiga-like toxin and pediocin production.

RESULTS
composition of microbiota in healthy and infected dairy cows: isolation and identification of bacterial species
analysis of the microbiota of the reproductive tract of dairy cows was initially based on a qualitative, culture-dependent approach. bacterial isolates were obtained from healthy, pre-partum animals  or metritic, post-partum animals . clonal isolates were eliminated by rapd-pcr analysis and isolates differing in their origin, rapd profile, or colony morphology were identified on the basis of the sequence of approximately  <dig> bp of the 16s rrna genes. strain identification to species level was based on 97% or greater sequence homology to type strains. strains of the species e. coli could not be identified on the basis of 16s rrna sequences alone because of the high homology of rdna sequences to closely-related species such as shigella spp. and escherichia fergusonii. classification of all e. coli strains was verified with species-specific pcr and api-20e test strips. the biochemical characteristics of isolates matched properties of e. coli  in the api-20e database. the identity of thirty isolates and their origin is listed in table  <dig>

*cow #2211-a and 2211-b represent two different animals that were assigned the same number at different times.

healthy, pregnant animals and those diagnosed with post partum uterine infections at the time of sampling are indicated in brackets.

bacilli, staphylococci, and lactic acid bacteria of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, and pediococcus were present in both healthy and infected cows. escherichia coli were also frequently isolated, particularly from infected animals. isolates were screened for the presence of slt-i and slt-ii genes, sample results for their pcr detection in e. coli isolates are shown in figure 1a and figure 1b, respectively. e. coli fua <dig> isolated from cow # <dig> harboured the slt-i gene, while e. coli fua <dig> and fua <dig>  isolated from cow # <dig> and # <dig>  respectively harboured the slt-ii gene .


pediocin production
pcr screening revealed that ped. acidilactici fua <dig>  fua <dig>  and fua <dig> harboured the pediocin ach/pa- <dig> immunity gene . pediocin production was investigated for selected isolates via deferred inhibition assays. ped. acidilactici fua <dig> and fua <dig> produced inhibition zones against enterococcus faecalis fua <dig> . inhibition zones of comparable diameter were observed with l. innocua . further tests with proteinase k verified that the antimicrobial agent is a protein . other vaginal isolates including e. coli fua <dig>  fua <dig>  and fua <dig> were also used as indicator strains but no inhibition was observed .


quantification of bacterial groups, slt and pediocin structural genes
the dna concentration of most samples did not allow amplification with hda primers; pcr products could be obtained only for two samples . sequencing of the pcr products from these animals  confirmed that bacteria present in the bovine vagina of these two animals were accounted for by culturing . subsequently, quantitative pcr was employed as sensitive and quantitative tool for culture-independent analysis of the composition of vaginal microbiota before and after parturition. primers were selected to quantify bacterial groups isolated from healthy, pre-partum or postpartum animals, as well as slt genes and the pediocin structural gene  . fourty animals were sampled two weeks pre-partum and two weeks post-partum; of these, ten animals that developed metritis post-partum were selected for dna isolation and analysis by qpcr. to account for the large individual differences in the vaginal microbiota of different animals, results were calculated as differences  between the least square means of log rdna or dna copy numbers for each target group . copy number of 16s rdna from enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were below the detection limit of  <dig> copy numbers / g . the number of rdna copies of the lactobacillus group was relatively stable in the observation period. in all other cases, the postpartum gene copy values are higher than the prepartum values. the pediocin structural gene was consistently detected in low numbers. approximately a  <dig> log difference between the total bacteria values was observed. this increase was predominantly attributable to increased numbers of e. coli and enterobacteriaceae. e. coli increased on average by more than  <dig> log. genes coding for slt-i and slt-ii increased by less than  <dig> log.


discussion
this study provides a comparison of the vaginal microbiota of healthy, pregnant dairy cows, and infected postpartum cows. in contrast to the stable commensal microbiota observed in humans and other mammals  <cit> , total bacterial numbers in vaginal mucus were low and the composition of the bovine vaginal microbiota on species level was highly variable. bacteria found within the microbiota are thus likely to be contaminants from the environment , the cow’s skin , or faecal material , rather than representing a stable flora autochthonous to the reproductive tract. the lack of a competitive commensal vaginal microbiota may contribute to the susceptibility of dairy cows to bacterial overgrowth and metritis after parturition  <cit> . indeed, quantitative pcr demonstrated a substantial increase of bacterial numbers, particularly of enterobacteriaceae and e. coli, in infected cows after parturition compared to samples from the same animals obtained pre-partum.

overall, our data indicated that vaginal bacterial flora in cows affected by metritis was dominated by strains of e. coli, supporting previous observations  <cit> . this study extends previous results  <cit>  by documenting changes of the vaginal microbiota in individual animals in the first two weeks after calving. both the enterobacteriaceae and e. coli showed marked increase in mucus samples collected from infected postpartum cows. the amplification of shigella rdna with e. coli species-specific primers is not surprising because shigella spp. and e. coli are indistinguishable on the basis of rdna sequences  <cit> . in keeping with the recognition of shigella spp. as human-adapted pathovar of e. coli, all isolates were identified as e. coli by biochemical tests. culture-based analysis and qpcr demonstrated presence of shiga-like-toxin producing e. coli  in both healthy and infected animals. three out of eleven e. coli isolates were found to carry genes coding for slt- <dig> or slt-ii. moreover, slt-genes were consistently detected by qpcr in samples from metritic cows; stec accounted for about  <dig> – 10% of the total e. coli population. slt production causes diarrhoea in calves  <cit> , but the role of stec in the pathogenesis of metritis in adult animals warrants further clarification.

bacilli are present in the environment and they frequently contaminate the bovine uterine lumen  <cit> . however, pediococci have not yet been described as part of the bovine vaginal microbiota. the genus pediococcus is closely related to the genus lactobacillus. pediococci produce antimicrobial compounds such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and antimicrobial peptides such as pediocin ach/pa- <dig>  <cit> . ped. acidilactici is a food fermenting organism  <cit>  but was also isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of poultry, ducks, and sheep <cit> . pediocin ach/pa- <dig> producing strains have been isolated from human infant faeces  <cit> .

the synthesis of pediocin ach/pa- <dig> was initially described for the strains ped. acidilactici pac <dig>  and ped. acidilactici h, but synthesis has also been observed in other ped. acidilactici strains as well as lactobacillus plantarum whe <dig>  pediococcus parvulus ato <dig>  and ato <dig>  <cit> . pediocin ach/pa- <dig> production is a plasmid-borne trait  <cit> . the pediocin ach/pa- <dig> operon consists of pediocin ach/pa- <dig> gene , a specific immunity gene , and genes responsible for processing and secretion   <cit> . in keeping with prior reports on pediocin activity  <cit> , pediocin was not active against e. coli, the dominant organisms in the vaginal microbiota of infected animals. pediocin producing isolates characterized in this study harboured the pediocin ach/pa- <dig> operon, and qpcr analysis consistently detected the operon in both prepartum and postpartum vaginal samples.

bacteriocin formation is increasingly recognized as an important trait of probiotic cultures  <cit> . studies on the isolation of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from the human vagina demonstrated their antimicrobial activities against human vaginal pathogens  <cit> . bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains inhibited vaginal pathogens including gardnerella vaginalis and pseudomonas aeroginosa <cit> . although bovine vaginal microbiota have much lower total cell counts and lactobacilli populations in comparison to the human vaginal microbiota  <cit> , bacteriocin such as pediocin may influence the microbial ecology in the reproductive tract of dairy cattle if bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria are administered in high numbers.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, culture-dependent analysis of the bacterial vaginal microbiota of dairy cows, supported by qpcr analysis, allowed the characterization of the bovine vaginal microbiota of healthy pregnant and infected postpartum cows. identification of pediocin-producing pediococci in the bovine vaginal microbiota may allow the development of novel prophylactic interventions against metritis by application of bacteriocin-producing probiotic bacteria into the vaginal tract of dairy cows.
