BACKGROUND
as the first stage of protein synthesis in gene expression, translation is a key process highly conserved in the biological system. up to now,  <dig> universally occurring genes identified in  <dig> species are shown being involved in the translation process  <cit> . however, translation initiation shows great variation in the three kingdoms. in eukaryotes, the ribosome binds at the 5'-end of the capped mrna and slides downstream to find the first start codon and then initiate the translation, which is the so-called scanning mechanism  <cit> . in prokaryotes, there are two known mechanisms. the shine-dalgarno  initiation mechanism was found early in escherichia coli  <cit> . for this mechanism, a short motif called sd sequence in the 5'-untranslated region  on mrna binds with the 3'-end of 16s rrna on the ribosome and helps the ribosome directly identify the translation initiation site . the other one, namely leaderless initiation, was found later in λ-phage of e. coli  <cit> . in this case, the mrna lacks a 5'-utr and hence has no sd sequence in it, thus the start codon itself serves as the most important signal for the translation initiation. there were ever propositions that signals downstream of the start codon called "downstream boxes" may bind with the 16s rrna and help translation initiation of leaderless genes, but these suggestions were then refuted by experimental evidences  <cit> . in fact, several studies reported that leaderless initiation uses an alternative way which is like that in eukaryotes and the leaderless λci gene can be faithfully translated in vitro in all three kingdoms  <cit> . what is more, this suggests that this initiation way may be the one used by the last universal common ancestor  and is conserved in all three kingdoms  <cit> .

regarding the diversity of translation initiation mechanism, sd initiation has long been considered the dominant way in prokaryotes. however, recent studies revealed that leaderless initiation should be as important as sd initiation in archaea, one of two branches in prokaryotes. computational study of  <dig> genes in the archaeal sulfolobus solfataricus indicated that distal genes in operon are sd-led while single genes and proximal genes in operon are leaderless  <cit> . further computational analysis showed that leaderless genes are demonstrated with a rather high proportion in the archaeal pyrobaculum aerophilum  <cit> . torarinsson et al. also analyzed  <dig> complete archaeal genome sequences and estimated the number of sd-led genes as well as leaderless genes, their results indicate that at least  <dig> of  <dig> archaeal genomes have plenty of leaderless genes  <cit> . in addition, experimental study in pyrobaculum aerophilum and haloarchaea also reported that the majority of transcripts are leaderless in those archaeal genomes  <cit> .

in spite of above-noted efforts to understand on archaea, little is known about the bacteria-wide situation of leaderless genes. one of major reasons is that translation initiation was believed more complex in archaea than in bacteria  <cit> , which led to lack of attention on this issue and continuing to use the canonical explanation by neglecting leaderless initiation mechanism in bacteria. recently, a few experimental verified leaderless genes were reported in bacteria  <cit> , however it is extremely difficult to explore a clear scenario of the leaderless genes at the bacteria-wide level since them seem to scatter occasionally in some bacterial genomes with a shortage of known data. nevertheless, there were some computational analyses in respect of the translation initiation mechanism in bacteria, however mainly based on the genes likely using sd-led initiation way, other than the leaderless one. sd sequences in  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal species were investigated and found their occurrence varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . chang et al. also studied  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal complete genomes and gave number estimates of sd-led genes from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . a most recent work is noteworthy: nakagawa et al. analyzed  <dig> prokaryotes  to survey the proportion of sd-led genes in each genome, and then to discuss the link with initiation mechanism  <cit> . however, knowing the proportion of sd-led genes does not lead to the knowledge of the leaderless ones. moreover, to estimate the number of sd-led genes, most of these algorithms usually detected sd signals by a simple scanning method which may ignore the nucleotide composition bias of each genome. at the same time, lack of the test of statistical significance would not give a solid evidence for meaningful signals detected in these algorithms. with currently more than thousand of complete bacterial genomes deposited in the public database or in sequencing, it is more and more significant to reveal the translation initiation mechanism by a clear picture of leaderless genes at the state of the art bacteria-wide level, which should be based on a more accurate and reliable analytical study.

the objective of this study is to answer the question to understand the translation initiation mechanism and its evolutionary scenario in view of leaderless genes in bacteria. we developed an algorithm, which is validated with statistical significance, to classify the initiation regulatory signals upstream to gene start into sd-like, ta-like and atypical signals for all genes in each prokaryotic genome. the method leads to definite identification of both leadered and leaderless genes in a genome. we examined  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal genomes and annotated diverse translation initiation signals in these genomes. focusing on the leaderless genes and their initiation signals, our analysis reveals that leaderless genes are totally widespread, although not dominant, in a variety of groups in bacteria. what more useful is the quantitative relationships of evolution of initiation signals in bacteria, which might provide a clear picture of the evolution of translation initiation mechanisms.

RESULTS
we have performed a thorough analysis on  <dig> bacterial as well as  <dig> archaeal genomes  by classifying all genes in each genome into categories of being sd-led, ta-led or atypical, meanwhile annotating the translation initiation signal for each gene. the definition and algorithm can be seen in materials and methods for details. the translation initiation signal annotations are available at our webpage  <cit> . generally speaking, ta-like signals are found in many genomes including both archaea and bacteria. in archaea, it has been discussed that ta-like signals at around  <dig> bp upstream to the tis mean leaderless genes, which use leaderless initiation. while in bacteria, ta-like signals  are identified at around  <dig> bp upstream to the tis , and have a consensus of tannnt, which resembles the - <dig> box of σ <dig> factor binding site "tataat" in e. coli  <cit> . these ta-like signals are likely to be transcription promoters and should appear at  <dig> bp upstream to the transcription start sites   <cit> . therefore, the ta-led genes have very short or missing 5'-utrs and are thus leaderless genes. in brief, our analysis demonstrates that many bacterial genomes have a substantial proportion of leaderless genes. based on the profile of signals recovered from the more than one thousand genomes, we then report our survey on translation initiation mechanism in the following subsections.

validation of the algorithm
to demonstrate how sure we can be that the relationship between the signals detected through the algorithm and gene translational initiation, we first show evidence for the statistical significance of the ta-like signals found in bacterial genomes, and then estimate the accuracy of our prediction for leaderless genes. a limiting case of examples is the e. coli-k <dig> genome, which is commonly known with leadered genes. for this genome, the algorithm positively detects the sd-like genes and a small quantity of atypical genes. herein we go on further to make the assessment on strain streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  which belongs to a family of ubiquitous gram-positive soil bacteria used to produce the natural antibiotics, and is also a model organism for the study of leaderless genes  <cit> . the s. coelicolor a <dig> genome has one chromosome and two plasmids. in the chromosome,  <dig> bp tis upstream sequences of totally  <dig> protein-coding genes are extracted. as a result, among the  <dig> genes the gene-classification procedure identifies  <dig> genes  that have the ta-like signal and they are hence classified as leaderless genes. a shuffling test  shows that no more than  <dig> ta-led genes would be identified in random sequences retaining dinucleotide frequency . the validation was also performed on all other genomes in which leaderless genes are detected ), similar results demonstrate that our algorithm is based on a statistical significance .

a search is further performed in google scholar with the key words "leaderless and streptomyces coelicolor" followed by reading the literatures, it reveals only  <dig> leaderless genes documented for s. coelicolor a <dig>  of which most of the tsss are coincident with the first nucleotide of putative tiss. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  have an apparent pribnow box upstream to their tiss . our annotation demonstrates that  <dig> of these  <dig> leaderless genes  are predicted by us , and the predicted pribnow boxes generally agree with those proposed in the literatures .

1the last three characters are triplet for start codons, experimentally determined tsss are bold, and the most-likely pribnow boxs are italic. the - <dig> promoters proposed in literature, if available, are underlined.

2the probability that a gene is a leaderless gene regulated by σ <dig> was calculated by eq.  <dig> 

it should be noted that the current algorithm is not sensitive enough to the genome when it has a few leaderless genes. in addition, with a widely-used pribnow box as reference consensus , the algorithm maybe fail in detecting some few leaderless genes with non-pribnow signal for bacteria in this study. so when a bacterial genome is not judged by the algorithm having leaderless genes, it does not simply mean that the genome has not any leaderless genes, perhaps its leaderless genes are very small in number or without the common pribnow signal. however in summary, the simulation based on large sample size shows that our ta-like signal prediction has a significant difference from the random strings by the background. this may lead to identifying leaderless genes with a statistical reliability in the current study. although it is difficult to estimate the prediction accuracy due to lack of experimental data, our prediction is still shown to include most of the known leaderless genes literature-documented at least in this example.

high usage of leaderless genes in archaea
based on the leaderless genes identified for each genome, we then present an overall view of leaderless genes in all archaea studied here . on the whole,  <dig> of  <dig> sequenced genomes are shown to have leaderless genes, with an average proportion of  <dig> %. among them,  <dig> of  <dig> crenarchaeal organisms have averaged  <dig> % leaderless genes in their genomes. the three genomes missing leaderless genes are desulfurococcus kamchatkensis, hyperthermus butylicus and staphylothermus marinus respectively . in euryarchaeota,  <dig> of  <dig> sequenced genomes have averaged  <dig> % leaderless genes. actually, all euryarchaeal genomes missing leaderless genes belong to methanogens, which is consistent with the notion that leaderless genes are undetectable in m. kandleri and m. jannaschii  <cit> . however, we identified leaderless genes in  <dig> of the  <dig> methanogens. the  <dig> genomes have an averaged g+c content of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % while the remaining  <dig> genomes have g+c content of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. this shows that the presence of leaderless genes is related to the g+c content of the genomes. in addition, the two deep branching archaeal genomes, korarchaeum cryptofilum opf <dig> and nanoarchaeum equitans kin4-m, have  <dig> % and  <dig> % leaderless genes, respectively. therefore, our analysis well demonstrates the common sense that the archaeal genomes have a high proportion of leaderless genes  <cit> , in more detail, with a wide variation from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

diverse distribution of leaderless genes in bacteria
it is of great interest in this study to discuss the leaderless genes in bacteria. below we report the analysis of leaderless genes in all bacterial genomes . overall, the results show that the algorithm detects  <dig> among  <dig> bacterial genomes having leaderless genes, and these  <dig> genomes include acidobacteria, actinobacteria, aquificae, bacteroidetes/chlorobi, chloroflexi, deinococcus-thermus, firmicutes, proteobacteria , spirochaetes, and one unclassified in refseq. unlike in archaea, leaderless genes are not identified in most genomes, however are shown to concentrate in a few groups. the most notable group is actinobacteria, including high-gc and gram-positive genomes. the actinobacteria usually live in a variety of natural environments such as soil, freshwater and the sea, and some of them being human pathogens, meanwhile are well known as secondary metabolite producers and are important in pharmaceutical industry  <cit> . due to their importance,  <dig> species have been completely sequenced. despite the biodiversity in the  <dig> genomes, our method detects leaderless genes in nearly all  with proportions around 20%. this is in accordance with previous reports of leaderless genes found in streptomyces and corynebacterium  <cit> . the deinococcus-thermus group is also noticeable, although there are only five genomes completely sequenced. our analysis shows that all five have leaderless genes with high proportions . among them, the deinococcus radiodurans r <dig> genomes is detected with the highest occurrence of leaderless genes  in all bacteria. in fact, this group includes the deinococcus species which are radiation-resistant, and thermus thermophilus which is thermophilic. the high presence of leaderless genes in these genomes may highly probably correspond to their extreme habitat, as suggested for archaea  <cit> . besides these two groups, leaderless genes are shown to present in a few genera or species for other groups. for example in γ-proteobacteria, leaderless genes are most found in xanthomonadales and legionellales, which are located near the root of γ-proteobacteria, showing that the missing of leaderless genes in other γ-proteobacteria may be due to one loss event during the genome evolution. in firmicutes, leaderless genes concentrate in two clades, lactobacillales and mycoplasma. in lactobacillales, leaderless genes are identified in two subclades: the lactococcus-streptococcus and the oenococcus-leuconostoc clade, while not in enterococcus and lactobacillus. neither genomes with leaderless genes nor those without leaderless genes form a monophyletic group, probably showing the complex evolution of translation initiation mechanism in lactobacillales. in addition, leaderless genes are found in five genomes in mycoplasma, with an averaged occurrence of  <dig> %.

it has been reported that metabolic-related genes, especially for energy production and conversion, tend to show a higher proportion of sd-containing genes  <cit> . here we did a similar study on the cog  function categories of leaderless genes in all genomes having leaderless genes. the results show that the information storage and processing categories have relatively higher proportion of leaderless genes . especially in the cog categories of rna processing and modification  and chromatin structure and dynamics , the proportion of leaderless genes is much higher than in other categories. it is worth noting that these two categories have only a small number of genes in prokaryotes, but are more widespread in eukaryotes. leaderless genes are also more likely to present in genes belonging to the cog category of transcription , but less likely to present in genes of translation . the cellular processes and signaling categories generally have lower proportion of leaderless genes.

as the transcription promoters well as the translation initiation signals for leaderless genes, the ta-like signals detected in bacteria merit a conscientious attention. in fact as shown in figure  <dig>  our results revealed the variation of the detected ta-like signals across species. in high-gc  groups such as actinobacteria and deinococcus-thermus, the signals have a tannnt pattern where the three positions in the middle provide but little information ; in medium-gc  groups such as aquificae and chloroflexi, the signals have a tataat pattern just like the typical pribnow box in e. coli  <cit>  where the three positions in the middle become more informative ; while in firmicutes, which have mostly low-gc  genomes, the signals became tataat, where the two as in the middle became as high as the a and t in the second and sixth positions . moreover in several low-gc genomes, the tg peak before pribnow box can be observed as seen in figure 1d, which has been reported to substitute for the function of the - <dig> region  <cit> . for example in lactococcus, the tg peak is extremely strong and this probably means that the - <dig> region is missing in this genus. this is probably because the signal is at-rich, and in low-gc genomes, the signal needs to be strengthened to remain informative, while in high-gc genomes, it degrades weaker as the tannnt pattern already provides enough information. considering our algorithm has been designed to compensate the nucleotide composition bias from genomic background, such a tendency of signal conservation by different gc content seems to be nontrivial and worth further studying. more specifically, this tendency is most probably related with genome evolution in some phylogenetic bacterial groups.

atypical genes in prokaryotes
besides the typical ta-like and the sd-like signals, the algorithm also identifies a lot of so-called atypical signals. genes bearing these signals, namely atypical genes, are probably sd-less leadered genes, however they could also be leaderless genes with unknown promoter signals. in fact, several clades, for example mycoplasma, cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes, are shown to have a substantial number of atypical genes. it is still uncertain to understand the atypical signals detected in both bacteria and archaea. for example in halophilic archaea, most leadered transcripts have no sd sequence in their leader regions  <cit> , and this genes use new translation initiation mechanisms that are still unknown  <cit> . however, some atypical signals are shown conserved across species and have conserved position distributions relative to tis. for instance in cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and other groups, a conserved dipyrimidine is located immediately upstream to the tiss, which is consistent with the findings in the previous study  <cit> . another at-rich signal without strong consensus is found in bacteroidetes and many other groups. these at-rich signals are suggested to bind ribosomal protein s <dig>  <cit>  or facilitate translation initiation by affecting mrna secondary structure  <cit> . other atypical signals are likely to be patterns of coding regions, transcription factor binding sites, or other unknown translation or transcription signals. altogether such signal can serve as a target for biologists to decipher its regulation role by experiments, thus leading to a better understanding of the initiation mechanism.

to sum up as a result, our analysis described above revealed that the translation initiation mechanism in bacteria is far from a simple scenario as previously imaged, and therefore a complex scenario with diversity should be rebuilt. though sd-led genes are dominant in firmicutes, proteobacteria, and many other groups as previously regarded, leaderless genes are found with high occurrence in many groups such as actinobacteria and deinococcus-thermus. moreover, many genomes in cyanobacteria and bacteroidetes use neither sd-led genes nor leaderless genes. the translation initiation mechanisms in those genomes are largely unknown yet to be unravelled. in the following part, we try to understand this diversity from an evolutionary point of view.

evolution scenario of translation initiation mechanisms
it is believed that the mechanism of translation initiation has dynamically changed during the prokaryotic genome evolution  <cit> . however, it is difficult to speculate an evolutionary history for the translation initiation mechanism even by a rough trend. herein with a clear classification of initiation signals using by all genes for each genome, it can facilitate exploring the microevolution of translation initiation signals among closely related bacteria. the genome-level distribution of leaderless genes shows that phylogenetically close species tend to be the same behavior of having or having not leaderless genes together. for example, leaderless genes are present in nearly all of the actinobacterial genomes, although they show great variety in their size and habitat. this suggests that the presence of leaderless genes is inheritable and genome-level gains and losses of leaderless genes are nontrivial events in the evolutionary history. to this end,  <dig> actinobacterial genomes  were compared with the s. coelicolor a <dig> genome. for each genome and s. coelicolor, orthologous genes are extracted by best reciprocal match. a distance characterizing the substitution of translation initiation signals is then calculated based on markov model as described in the methods section. it is extremely notable that the distance shows a roughly linear correlation along with the evolution distance of 16s rrna with a ratio of  <dig>  , which corresponds to the substitution rate between sd-like signal and ta-like signal along with the substitution rate of 16s rrna as species distance for these bacteria. accordingly in the bacterial genome-level, it implies that the change of translation initiation mechanisms , which happens between the genes deriving from a common ancestor, is linearly dependent on the phylogenetic relationship in these species. moreover, this nontrivial ratio seems to be universal since a similar ratio  <dig>  is obtained by comparing  <dig> genomes in the class streptococcaceae and streptococcus pyogenes m <dig> gas .

the distance calculation gives a quantitative description for the substitution rate of translation initiation signals, but it does not give any evolutionary direction. is there any trend in the macroevolution of translation initiation mechanism? to this end, a tree of the 16s rrna sequences of  <dig> bacterial genomes was built and rooted with archaea outgroups. as shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> genomes were then sorted and put into  <dig> bins according to their distance to root on the tree. the  <dig> genomes nearest to root were put into the first bin; the 61-120th nearest were put the second bin, and so on. for genomes in each bin, an average proportion of leaderless gene was calculated. the proportions show a rapid decrease from over 15% to lower than 3% followed by fluctuation around that level. this trend indicates that slower evolving bacteria have more leaderless genes in their genome. if the trend holds, it gives a scenario that the luca have even more leaderless genes than 15% in its genome, and leaderless genes have been lost during evolution. similarly,  <dig> archaeal genomes were put into two bins according to their distance to root on the 16s rrna tree. the average proportion of leaderless genes in short-branch genomes is  <dig> %, while the number in long-branch genomes is  <dig> %. this trend, opposite to that in bacteria, is in accordance with previous report that high levels of leaderless genes predominate in the longer-branch archaea, while organisms with the shortest branches use more sd-led genes  <cit> . thus the proportion of leaderless genes in the luca might be estimated as between the average level of leaderless genes in short-branch bacteria  and the average level of leaderless genes in archaea .

there is a further question of concern, why leaderless genes were lost in many bacterial genomes while sd-led genes became dominant? one main driving force might be the coevolution of translation initiation signals and the operon structure  <cit> . note that in a polycistronic transcript, only the proximal gene could be leaderless while the distal genes usually need sd signals to facilitate translation initiation. if there are a lot of operon distal genes in a genome, there are likely more sd-led genes. for example in e. coli,  <dig> genes formed  <dig> operons  <cit> , and the proportion of operon distal genes is / <dig> =  <dig> %. while in s. coelicolor which has more leaderless genes and less sd-led genes,  <dig> genes formed  <dig> operons  <cit> , and the proportion of operon distal genes is / <dig> =  <dig> %, lower than that in e. coli. to test this hypothesis, we estimated the proportion of operon distal genes in a genome using gene direction information  <cit> . the proportion of operon distal genes shows strong positive correlation with the proportion of sd-led genes in both archaea ad bacteria . this suggests that usage of operon structure have strong effect on the evolution of translation initiation mechanism, including the trend of decreasing leaderless genes along with phylogenetic relationship shown in figure  <dig>  then why leaderless genes still retain in some genomes? one explanation is that they experienced slower evolution and kept the ancestral features as suggested in archaea  <cit> . what is more, leaderless initiation also has some possible evolution advantages. one is that it may be used for strict control of some genes so that they would not be translated on spurious transcription of the cognate genes by leakage from upstream operons  <cit> . another advantage of leaderless initiation is that it is not affected by some antibiotics that fully inhibit sd initiation  <cit> .

one limitation of the current study should be noticed that only leaderless genes with transcriptional promoters resembling the pribnow box are identified. this may cause an underestimation for the number of leaderless genes, especially in genomes with a large amount of atypical genes, such as mycoplasma, bacteroidetes, and cyanobacteria. however, σ <dig> is the most widely used σ factor in bacterial genomes, and its σ <dig> domain is highly conserved with binding to the pribnow box  <cit> . it is unlikely that there exist high percentages of leaderless genes not identified by our method. therefore, despite this limitation, the analysis did suggest the general evolutionary trend of translation initiation mechanisms in bacteria.

discussion
although leaderless genes have been studied extensively in archaea, they have long been regarded as rare events in bacteria  <cit> . recent works reported the possibility of high occurrence of leaderless genes in some bacterial genomes  <cit> , but their propositions are just based on lack of sd sequences in those genomes, and not direct evidence of leaderless genes. in this study, we have clearly shown that leaderless genes are totally widespread, although not dominant, in a variety of groups in bacteria. two of these groups, deinococcus-thermus and actinobacteria, deserve serious attention. as the algorithm detects, deinococcus-thermus is the phylum that has the most leaderless genes, averaged over 30%. it is interesting that most organisms in this group live in extreme environments. for example, d. radiodurans is capable of withstanding an acute dose of  <dig>  gy of ionizing radiation with almost no loss of viability  <cit> , while thermus are of the most thermophilic bacteria and can grow at 85°c  <cit> . these environments may reflect the traits of ancient earth. thus this suggests an important role of leaderless initiation mechanism playing for the ancestral organisms in the original habitat. the later group actinobacteria is the major antibiotics producer in both nature and industry  <cit> . it is known that most antibiotics attack the translation system. specifically speaking, antibiotics such as kasugamycin and pactamycin inhibit translation initiation on leadered transcripts but have no effect on leaderless transcripts <cit> . therefore, the high occurrence of leaderless genes in actinobacteria may suggest the correlation to their antibiotics production.

in our method, all weight matrices and position distributions are learned automatically from the genome sequences. it's worth noting that there are several additional predefined parameters for the model, such as the length of region upstream to tis in which signals are searched . generally, increasing the length could improve the sensitivity of motif finding. however, this would cost more computation time and the algorithm may find too many unexpected motifs unrelated to translation initiation. therefore we limited the region to a proper range which is enough for finding signals. in both bacteria and archaea, sd sequences are usually 4- <dig> bp in length and located at 5- <dig> bp upstream to the tis  <cit> , therefore the region of  <dig> bp upstream tis is enough to cover the signals. for leaderless genes in bacteria, the - <dig> box is 6- <dig> bp in length  and the distance between the - <dig> box and the transcription start site varies between - <dig> and - <dig> bases . therefore the - <dig> box is also covered by the  <dig> bp region in bacteria. for leaderless genes in archaea, the tata box is located about 25- <dig> bp from the transcription start  <cit>  and tis upstream region of  <dig> bp is enough to cover it. when longer regions  are used for searching signals, ta-like signals are found in some new species. however, the position of these ta-like signals are not aggregated and mostly located far from the - <dig> region of the tis, and thus these signals are more likely transcription promoters of leadered genes.

according to current evidences, sd-led initiation and leaderless initiation are probably both used by the luca. evidence for the usage of sd-led initiation by the luca includes broad usage of sd sequence and the high conservation of anti-sd sequence in both bacteria and archaea  <cit> , and meanwhile leaderless initiation is also proposed to be used by the luca considering its usage in all three kingdoms  <cit> . however, it is also possible that leaderless initiation originated only in archaea if leaderless gene is a marginal effect in bacteria as long regarded. our results have shown the broad occurrence of leaderless genes in bacteria, especially in actinobacteria, where around 20% genes are leaderless . this indicates that leaderless genes were used by the luca, because it is unlikely that the leaderless initiation mechanism originated independently in bacteria and archaea and both become so important. in conclusion, our results provide further support for the proposition that leaderless initiation was used by the luca.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have studied the translation initiation signals in  <dig> sequenced prokaryotic genomes and demonstrated the distribution of translation initiation mechanisms used in these genomes. the most surprising finding is that, though not as common as in archaea, there are substantial numbers of leaderless genes in bacteria. most genomes with high percentage of leaderless genes are located near the root on the 16s rrna tree and have relatively small number of operon distal genes. these facts show that current leaderless genes in bacteria are likely to be remnants of the ancestor and are retained because those genomes have low demand of organizing genes into operons for highly efficient and specialized gene expression.
