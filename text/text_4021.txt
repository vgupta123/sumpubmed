BACKGROUND
citrus is one of the most economically important fruit crops in the world. harvested fruits are usually stored before they reach the market for fresh consumption. during this postharvest period fruits are subjected to both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. penicillium digitatum, the causal agent of green mold, is the major pathogen of citrus fruit worldwide during postharvest storage. control of this fungus is mostly based on the use of chemical fungicides, such as imazalil or thiabendazol. however, problems associated with the use of these compounds are leading to the development of new and safer control alternatives, which mostly rely on biological control microorganisms, physical or chemical treatments either as standalone or combined treatments. another approach focuses on improving the natural defense capability of the fruit. however, despite the economic relevance of losses due to p. digitatum infection, there have been few studies directed to unravel citrus fruit responses to pathogen invasion or to elicitors that increase resistance against pathogen infection.

it is well known that the flavedo  is more resistant to p. digitatum than the albedo   <cit> . this fact has been classically associated with the presence of both preformed and induced antifungal compounds in the flavedo  <cit> . moreover, the concentration of some phytoalexins, such as scoparone, increases in the flavedo in response to p. digitatum attack, although a much higher induction is achieved by treatments that increase resistance in the fruit  <cit> . other responses triggered by this fungus include the induction of pr proteins, such as Î²- <dig> -glucanase and chitinase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase , which catalyzes the first step in the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> .

ethylene is a major modulator of many processes in plants, including regulation of defense responses to pathogen attack  <cit> . increase in ethylene production by pathogen infection is a well characterized process. in citrus fruit, infection with p. digitatum enhances ethylene emission, which is provided by both the fruit and the fungus  <cit> . many of the aforementioned responses of citrus fruit to p. digitatum infection are at least partially dependent on this hormone  <cit> . the relevance of ethylene in the defense response has also been shown by the increased susceptibility to the pathogen when ethylene perception was blocked by the ethylene antagonist 1-methyl cyclopropene <cit> .

being p. digitatum a successful pathogen of citrus fruit, it must be able to overcome the fruit's defense barriers. thus, besides triggering different defense responses in the host, it is also able to suppress different lines of defense. the first evidence of this suppression of defenses was the observation that ethylene-mediated induction of pal was greatly reduced in the presence of the fungus  <cit> . we have previously shown that this suppression seems to involve posttranscriptional regulation because pal gene induction was not accompanied by induction of enzyme activity  <cit> . production of reactive oxygen species  has also been shown to be suppressed in citrus fruit inoculated with p. digitatum, whereas inoculation with p. expansum, a closely related species but non-pathogenic on citrus fruit, triggers the production of ros at attempted penetration sites  <cit> . on the other hand, the activity of different enzymes involved in the metabolism of ros decreases in p. digitatum-infected fruit, albeit flavedo and albedo exhibit different patterns of enzyme inactivation  <cit> .

construction of cdna libraries and generation of ests have become useful tools to identify plant genes responsive to pathogens  <cit> . the citrus functional genomics project  aims to characterize the main biological and agronomical traits of citrus  <cit> . as a key part of this project, a citrus est collection has been generated from  <dig> cdna libraries covering different tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. one of these libraries, rindpdig <dig>  was obtained from the flavedo and albedo of citrus fruit  infected with p. digitatum. in order to gain a better understanding of the citrus fruit's responses to p. digitatum infection we sought to identify citrus genes that are up-regulated in response to this pathogen. in the present work we describe the construction and analysis of a subtractive cdna library, named rindpdigs, enriched in defense-related mrnas. a cdna macroarray derived from this subtracted cdna library has been used to interrogate the role of ethylene in the regulation of citrus genes induced by p. digitatum infection.

RESULTS
construction of a subtracted cdna library enriched in pathogen-responsive ests
we used the ssh method  <cit>  to dissect the response of citrus fruit to p. digitatum by obtaining a cdna library  enriched in citrus genes that have higher expression upon p. digitatum infection  than in the corresponding wounded controls . infected tissue was collected  <dig> hours post-inoculation  to allow identification of early fruit responses and to maximize the number of fruit genes, since under these conditions the first symptoms of fruit maceration by the fungus begin at  <dig> hpi. we have previously demonstrated that some defense-related genes start to increase their expression at  <dig> hpi, but maximum expression was reached at  <dig> hpi  <cit> .

a nylon filter array was constructed with pcr amplicons from  <dig>  randomly picked clones from the rindpdigs library, as well as  <dig> positive and negative controls . in a confirmatory experiment, the macroarray was hybridized with labelled cdnas from the same samples used for the construction of the subtracted library. as a result of the analysis ,  <dig> clones  with differential expression were identified, from which  <dig> were up-regulated in i over w, whereas  <dig> were down-regulated. these preliminary results demonstrated that rindpdigs is enriched in genes with higher expression in infected than in wounded tissue, and confirmed that the generated cdna macroarray is an effective efficient tool for analyzing the transcriptional responses of citrus fruit to p. digitatum infection.

identification of gene expression changes in the response of citrus fruit to ethylene, wounding and/or infection
additional rna samples were obtained from 'navelina' oranges treated with either ethylene   or with air  for  <dig> h in the absence of infection, and were processed to conduct macroarray hybridizations. the expression results obtained after image quantification and data processing were analyzed for significant changes between two independent conditions . six different comparisons were carried out, referred to as e/a, w/a, i/a, w/e, i/e and i/w. the complete set of data as log <dig> ratios for the  <dig> spots can be found as additional file  <dig> 

only  <dig> ests did not show any significant change in any of the six comparisons, although out of this group  <dig> clones did not show hybridization signal in any tested condition. fifty five ests were specifically present in only one treatment, whereas  <dig> were specifically absent in one condition. the remaining clones that showed differential expression in at least one condition were grouped into distinct gene expression classes. a representative illustration of the distribution of induced or repressed clones in the three experimental conditions respect to the air control is shown in fig.  <dig>  for instance,  <dig>  clones were found to be induced in response to p. digitatum infection over the control, from which  <dig> also showed induction by ethylene, whereas  <dig> showed specific induction in response to pathogen challenge and  <dig> were only detected in infected peel tissue. the array contained  <dig> down-regulated ests during infection as compared to the air control. expression classes additional to those summarized in fig.  <dig> were also identified since some ests were up-regulated in some of the conditions and down-regulated in others . noteworthy,  <dig> of the clones repressed by infection were induced in response to ethylene treatment. on the other hand, among clones induced during infection there were  <dig> whose expression was repressed by ethylene and  <dig> by wounding. thus, although the general pattern corresponded to transcripts induced by infection, ethylene or both stimuli, there was a minor but significant number of clones that deviate from such general response, revealing the complexity of gene regulation in citrus fruit in response to pathogen infection.

sequence analysis of rindpdigs
a total of  <dig> sequences were obtained from  <dig> rindpdigs clones. these clones included representatives from each one of the different expression patterns, as well as all the clones that showed a high hybridization signal and those that showed an infection/wounding ratio higher than  <dig>  only  <dig> of the sequenced clones contained two inserts and  <dig> clone contained three inserts . a total of  <dig> sequences were assembled into  <dig> contiguous sequences , while  <dig> sequences were singletons , accounting for a total of  <dig> unigenes . using the blastx algorithm, dna sequences were searched against the ncbi non-redundant protein database. the complete set of sequence assignments can be found as additional file  <dig>  we are aware that some of the identified unigenes could be derived from the same mrna. therefore, we conducted sequence analyses with homologous gene sequences in databases to search for such cases among the most abundant or representative contigs. hence, contigs p- <dig> and p- <dig> align perfectly to the c. sinenis csaco gene  and are flanked by rsai restriction sites, the enzyme used to digest the cdna during construction of the subtracted cdna library. a similar situation occurred with contigs p- <dig>  p- <dig> and clone n14g <dig>  these three unigenes align contiguously to the cfgp unigen acl246contig <dig>  which shows high similarity to an oxidoreductase that contains a fad-binding domain.

as a first step in characterizing the transcriptional profile of infected fruit we identified the contigs containing the highest number of ests. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> most abundant contigs, and presents the gene expression profile of each gene under the different examined conditions. in general, profiles showed an induction of expression with infection and to a lower, but significant level, also with wounding and ethylene treatment. as a remark of this general response we have summarized the data on the sequenced est with the highest ratio of expression in infected versus wounded samples . tables  <dig> and  <dig> are two complementary ways of representing the transcriptional response of citrus fruit to p. digitatum infection. annotation of unigenes shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that many of these ests show homology to plant genes involved in secondary metabolism, such as those corresponding to 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate  synthase , fad-binding proteins, caffeine synthase, tropinone reductase or to different cytochrome p <dig>

three of the clusters shown in table  <dig> deviated from the general behavior of higher induction with infection. induction by ethylene treatment was higher than in any other condition in the case of a cystinosin homolog  and a cyclase family protein  . in the case of the contig p- <dig>  with no homology to known sequences, a repression after wounding  was concluded from our data. noteworthy is the specific expression in infected tissue of contig p- <dig>  which shows homology to a caffeine synthase. thirteen out of the  <dig> most abundant contigs showed homology to known sequences and only three contigs presented novel sequences with no homology to known sequences. interestingly, one of these elements is contig p- <dig>  which contains the highest number of ests and shows up-regulation only in response to pathogen challenge, whereas its expression level remains unchanged after ethylene treatment or wounding. a similar expression pattern is shown by the other most abundant contig, contig p- <dig>  which shows homology to a fad-dependent oxidoreductase. another highly represented gene with a high expression level in infected peel tissue shows homology to dahp. this gene, however, is also induced by ethylene and wounding. a gene coding for an acc oxidase, present in contigs p- <dig> and p- <dig>  is the only gene previously known to be highly induced in citrus fruit challenged with p. digitatum  <cit> . according to the hybridization results this gene is not expressed in control fruits but it is strongly up-regulated in all other conditions, being one of the genes with highest expression level in infected fruit tissue .

despite the low amount of fungal biomass at  <dig> hpi, the isolation of p. digitatum ests was expected and in fact fungal assignments were also obtained . although most of the fungal ests corresponded to ribosomal proteins, including contigs p- <dig> and p- <dig>  , we have also isolated transcripts corresponding to a hypothetical protein , an adp/atp carrier protein , a polygalacturonase and a translation elongation factor, which in general show a high up-regulation in infected tissue .

among the sequences with the highest induction in infected tissue over wounded tissue , we found six genes expressed only in infected peel tissue, including the fungal contig p- <dig>  three of them show homology to plant genes. contigs p- <dig> and p- <dig>  encoding a putative caffeine synthase and a short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, belong to this latter category. considering citrus genes that are expressed both in wounded and infected tissues, the highest induction level was found in contig p- <dig>  which shows homology to a cytochrome p <dig>  this gene showed a high up-regulation in response to pathogen infection, but its expression was not altered by either ethylene or wounding. a similar regulation pattern was found in most of the citrus genes shown in table  <dig>  although few genes were down-regulated by ethylene.

comparison of rindpdigs and rindpdig <dig> cdna libraries
rindpdig <dig> is a non-subtracted library representing the mrna population in the peel of mandarin fruits   <dig> hpi with p. digitatum, and its analysis within the context of the cfgp has already been reported  <cit> . however, it was of interest to conduct a comparative analysis of this non-subtracted library with the subtracted library rindpdigs . rindpdig <dig> contains a total of  <dig> high quality ests, grouped into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. remarkably, only  <dig> from the  <dig> most abundant contigs in rindpdigs are also found in rindpdig <dig> . moreover, only  <dig> unigenes are common to both libraries and  <dig> unigenes from rindpdigs  are not present in rindpdig <dig>  hence, these data confirm that rindpdigs, although more redundant than rindpdig <dig> , contains distinct sequence information, likely more specific of the infection process.

comparison of the distribution of ests into mips functional categories indicated differences between both libraries . higher abundance in rindpdigs was found in the categories "metabolism", "cellular transport", "interaction with the environment"  and "systemic interaction with the environment". categories with lower abundance in rindpdigs were "cell cycle", "transcription", "protein synthesis", and "regulation of metabolism and protein function". the most relevant annotation in terms of abundance as well as differences between the subtracted and non-subtracted libraries was metabolism . the distribution of ests in this category reveals that rindpdigs is enriched over rindpdig <dig> in genes related to secondary metabolism , amino acid metabolism  and lipid, fatty acid and isoprenoid metabolism , whereas nucleotide metabolism  is under-represented.  within secondary metabolism, that of methionine, and dehydroquinic, shikimic and chorismic acids, account for 60% of the annotations in the subtracted cdna library.

northern blot analyses of gene expression changes
to confirm the expression profiles obtained from macroarray hybridizations, northern blot analysis was carried out for  <dig> genes selected on the basis of their expression level, expression pattern or biological significance. in this analysis we included additional time points after treatments and confirmed the differential expression in response to both wounding and p. digitatum infection for  <dig> of them  .

examples of citrus genes up-regulated upon p. digitatum infection, and with lower or no expression in control or wounded samples, are homologs of tyrosine n-monooxygenase , nectarin  <dig> , caffeic acid Î-methyl transferase , tropinone reductase , caffeine synthase  and homogentisic acid prenyltransferase  . all these annotations are related to specific pathways of amino acids and secondary metabolism.

the most common expression pattern was induction in response to pathogen infection and to a lower extent with wounding, similarly to that found in macroarray hybridization data. there are examples of highly abundant mrnas in some  of the control conditions that increase their expression upon infection, as dahp synthase  or a gcpe homolog  . most of the citrus mrnas have maximum accumulation at  <dig> hpi and decrease at  <dig> hpi, likely as consequence of cellular lysis and degradation of plant cell constituents because of the maceration and colonization by p. digitatum  <cit> . nevertheless, northern hybridization allowed the identification of additional time-course patterns of expression and also of early responsive genes upon infection, such as n17a <dig>  involved in wax biosynthesis, or wounding, as n08f <dig>  encoding a tropinone reductase homolog, whose expression is maximal after  <dig> hours of treatment . contig p- <dig> is an example of a fungal gene  whose expression is detected only in infected tissue and shows a maximum expression at  <dig> hours after inoculation, coincident with the maximum development of the fungus throughout the rind .

northern blot analyses were also conducted to confirm expression changes induced by ethylene . in general, these results confirm those obtained by macroarray hybridization. most of the analyzed genes increased or switched on their expression after exogenous ethylene treatment, in correlation with their induction upon infection. however, examples from all the potential combinations of induction/repression after infection/ethylene were found. thus, there are examples of ethylene-activated genes that were not up-regulated upon infection, such as contigs p- <dig>  a cystinosin homolog, or p- <dig>  a Î²-carotene hydroxylase involved in carotenoid biosynthesis . moreover, the Î²-carotene hydroxylase transcript  disappeared at a higher rate than what it was expected from tissue maceration.

on the contrary, there are examples of genes induced during infection that are not responsive to ethylene, as the homologs of nectarin  <dig>  and caffeine synthase . interestingly, another unigene annotated as nectarin  <dig> homolog  was induced by ethylene and had an expression pattern distinct from p- <dig> . another result that points to a differential expression pattern of distinct genes from the same family is that found with probe n17b <dig>  which codes for an acetyl transferase homolog and that unexpectedly shows two mrna hybridization bands: the upper is turned on by ethylene, wounding and to a higher extent by infection, while the lower is insensitive to ethylene and in fact decays after wounding and infection . selected examples were found of genes repressed by ethylene, being the most representative the one coding for a homolog of an aquaporin involved in drought stress .

discussion
as an approach to understand the response of citrus fruit to p. digitatum infection we have used the ssh procedure  <cit>  to obtain a cdna library, rindpdigs, enriched in genes with increased expression in infected tissue. comparison of sequences from rindpdigs with those of the non-subtracted cdna library rindpdig <dig>  indicated that rindpdigs contains distinct sequence information and reinforces the convenience of using subtractive libraries to gain additional knowledge of specific biological processes. a factor that might explain the limited overlap between these two libraries could be the normalization step included in the ssh procedure, which enables the enrichment in genes with low but differential expression. although these two cdna libraries were obtained from two different citrus species, c. sinensis and c. clementina for rindpdigs and rindpdig <dig>  respectively, previous work has shown a high level of identity between homologous genes from these closely related citrus species  <cit> , as we have also found by comparing common unigenes between both libraries, whose identity was usually higher than 99%.

rindpdigs is now included within the spanish cfgp http://bioinfo.ibmcp.upv.es/genomics/cfgpdb/. in fact, our data indicate that 27% of the unigenes of rindpdigs are not found in any other of the cfgp libraries, which contain  <dig> unigenes, including the closely related rindpdig <dig> library. we recognize that this could be an overestimate, but it should be considered that although the cfgp is focused on c. clementina as plant material, it also contains libraries from c. sinensis, and that contig analysis parameters within cfgp are expected to cluster together sequences from the different citrus species covered by the project. moreover, 21% of the sequences of rindpdigs do not show blastx match with the ncbi non redundant database, and 4% of the sequences match proteins of unknown function. therefore rindpdigs is a rich source for the identification of new genes likely involved in the response of citrus fruit to pathogen attack. in fact, this tool has allowed the design and use of a cdna macroarray that enabled to gain novel conclusions. most importantly, our data indicate that citrus fruits react to pathogen infection in a regulated and coordinated manner, by upregulating genes involved in the synthesis of specific classes of compounds with potential antimicrobial activity.

regulation of gene expression changes upon p. digitatum infection
ethylene plays a pivotal role in many plant developmental and stress processes. in the case of defense against pathogen infection, the role of ethylene is complex and somewhat controversial  <cit> . diseased citrus fruits produce significant amounts of ethylene, both from fungal and plant origin  <cit> . we have previously shown that treatment of citrus fruits with either ethylene or the ethylene perception inhibitor 1-mcp prior to infection modifies the outcome of the interaction, suggesting a contribution of ethylene to defense against infection  <cit> .

ethylene-induced genes are highly present among those induced by wounding and infection. also, from the total ests that change their expression in response to pathogen infection , approximately 40% of them are affected by application of ethylene in absence of infection . conversely, approximately 50% of the ests responsive to exogenous ethylene are affected by infection. therefore, overall results indicate that although ethylene plays an important role in the regulation of the response of citrus fruits to p. digitatum infection, is only a part of a complex network and other factors/signals are also likely involved.

noteworthy examples of opposite regulation by ethylene and infection are observed in an est from the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, which is highly induced by ethylene   <cit>  but whose mrna decays quickly after infection despite the high ethylene emission, or those of specific alkaloid ests , which on the contrary are rather specific of infection but are not responsive to ethylene . a remarkable example is represented by two distinct unigenes putatively related to the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids biosynthetic pathway : p- <dig>  are specifically expressed upon fungal infection but do not react to the hormone, while n04d <dig>  which codes for a very similar protein, is induced by ethylene, wounding and fungal infection. this example illustrates the existence of a regulation that redirects secondary metabolism to the biosynthesis of specific compounds depending on the stress and the signals involved.

interestingly, ests potentially involved in signal perception and transduction were also identified among rindpdigs sequences. significant examples are three independent gtp-binding proteins , four protein kinases , two calcineurin-like phosphoesterases, one 14-3- <dig> like-protein, and three independent transcription factors. these data would suggest that the fruit reacts in a coordinated manner by inducing signaling cascades involved in the regulation of specific genes as a response to p. digitatum attack. however, only the complexity of this response is envisioned, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this response are far from being understood.

involvement of secondary and amino acid metabolisms in the response of citrus fruit to fungal infection
the annotation of rindpdigs clones revealed that secondary and amino acid metabolisms are involved in the response of citrus fruits to p. digitatum infection . in fact,  <dig> of the unigenes  and  <dig> of the total number of clones  of rindpdigs could be allocated in a schematic diagram that covers connections among some of these metabolic pathways . most of these ests have confirmed induction of expression by northern blot  and/or macroarray hybridizations .

the shikimate biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  is over-represented in rindpdigs. three different unigenes  are rsai fragments from a dahp synthase homolog, and account for  <dig> clones. it is well known that plant daph synthase is induced by wounding and pathogen attack  <cit> . there are two additional rindpdigs ests involved in the synthesis of shikimate and chorismate, respectively. the latter is the precursor of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine . plants use these amino acids as precursors of a large number of secondary metabolites that include defense compounds  <cit> . indeed, rindpdigs contains sequences annotated as o-methyltransferases, n-methyltransferases, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases and hydroxylases, fad oxidoreductases or decarboxylases that could be involved in metabolic conversions that stem from the aromatic amino acids to produce alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, and tocopherols .

tyrosine can go through a sequence of enzymatic modifications to produce dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which are condensed to originate the precursor of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids , including reticuline  <cit> . one step in the synthesis of the bia berberine is catalyzed by a fad-dependent oxidoreductase, named berberine bridge enzyme  as it converts the n-methyl group of -reticuline into the methylene bridge moiety of -scoulerine, a conversion that is unique in nature  <cit> . bbe is a key branchpoint enzyme in the biosynthesis of certain bias  <cit> . four distinct unigenes that arise from  <dig> clones were annotated as bbe-like sequences. one of them is the most abundant contig in rindpdigs , and was up-regulated during infection as it could be confirmed with northern blot and macroarray data. the significance of this class of alkaloids in the defense response against pest and pathogen attack is well known  <cit> .

although bbe catalyses a specific reaction in the biosynthesis of bias, other members of this family would be expected to act on a range of substrates, as recently demonstrated by the functional characterization of the tobacco nectarin  <dig> protein, a bbe homolog that has carbohydrate oxidase activity  <cit> . thus, the actual enzyme substrate and reaction for these citrus proteins remain unclear, as no bia has ever been shown to be produced in citrus. it has to be noted that genes similar to those participating in the biosynthesis of bias have also been isolated in other plants that do not produce these alkaloids  <cit> . interestingly, several citrus nectarin  <dig> homolog genes are also upregulated in c. sinensis plants infected with the bacterial pathogens xanthomonas axonopodis and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus, responsible of citrus canker and huanglonbing, respectively, as determined by microarray hybridization  <cit> .

isoprenoids are a large group of secondary metabolites, and their biosynthesis depends on the presence of the key precursor isopentenylpyrophosphate . in plants, two alternative pathways are involved in ipp biosynthesis, the cytosolic mevalonic acid  route and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate  one, whose first committed step is the synthesis of deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate   <cit> . rindpdigs library contains genes belonging to the mep pathway, as contig p- <dig>  which codes for the enzyme synthesizing dxp, and two unigenes annotated as gcpe-like sequences. our results showed that both dxs and gcpe are highly expressed genes in the fruit's peel under all tested conditions, and that reach higher mrna accumulation upon fungal infection. two additional sequences found in rindpdigs seem to be involved in the production of monoterpenoids from geranyl diphosphate : one with homology to 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase  and another with similarity to geraniol 10-hydroxylase . according to the macroarray data, only the first one showed an induction upon infection. interestingly, g <dig> h has been involved in terpenoid indole alkaloid  biosynthesis  <cit> , which proceeds through condensation of monoterpenes and tryptamine, a derivative of tryptophan   <cit> . it has also been shown that coordinated expression of mep pathway genes and g <dig> h would be required for the effective biosynthesis of tias  <cit> . moreover, fungal elicitors are strong inducers of tia production in cataranthus roseus  <cit> .

additional isoprenoids are carotenoids and tocopherols , whose biosynthesis is derived from ipp through geranylgeranylpyrophosphate   <cit> . carotenoid biosynthesis is highly upregulated in colored citrus fruits  <cit>  but seems to be repressed shortly after inoculation with p. digitatum, as indicated from results of the Î²-carotene hydroxylase contig p- <dig> derived from rindpdigs  and of phytoene synthase . in the case of tocopherol biosynthesis, the ggpp moiety is reduced and transferred to homogentisate , a distinct derivative of tyrosine, to produce the precursor for tocopherol cyclation. the coordinated actions of tocopherol cyclase and s-adenosylmethionine methyl transferases produce distinct tocopherol forms. both hga gg transferase  and tocopherol cyclase  are found in rindpdigs. contig p- <dig> is induced upon wounding and has early upregulation during infection . considering the down regulation of carotenoid biosynthetic genes, these data suggest that ipp and ggpp flux would be re-directed upon infection towards the synthesis of tocopherols and also monoterpenoid-derived tias, instead of carotenoids.

ests with homology to genes involved in the biosynthesis of two additional classes of plant alkaloids are also present in rindpdigs. the presence of a tropinone reductase est  suggests the involvement of tropane alkaloids in the response of citrus fruit to p. digitatum infection. although there are no evidences of the association of these alkaloids with disease resistance, tropane alkaloids production is induced upon elicitation with fungal cell walls, oligogalacturonides and also in response to exogenous meja and sa  <cit> . moreover, the same tropinone reductase homolog gene is induced in citrus plants challenged with x. axonopodis  <cit> . this est showed a clear early induction in response to wounding and a greater induction upon infection. the involvement of purine alkaloids is suggested by the presence of a caffeine synthase est , from the biosynthetic pathway of caffeine from xanthosine. this sequence showed a remarkable infection-specific response . as a matter of fact, the four ests that form this contig were selected for sequencing from the group of ests that were expressed only in infected tissue, the lack of signals in the controls precluded statistical analysis of expression in the macroarray data .

phenylpropanoids is the other major group of secondary metabolites that is overrepresented in the rindpdigs library. it is well known that phenylpropanoid production suffers rapid and drastic changes in response to pathogen infection  <cit> . phenylalanine-ammonia lyase  is the key entry point enzyme into the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids from phenylalanine and is known to be induced upon stress conditions  <cit> . p. digitatum enhanced pal mrna accumulation in citrus fruits  <cit> , and in fact this was one of the 16-times replicated controls included in the array. as expected, rindpdigs also contains an est corresponding to the citrus pal gene, as well as two distinct enzymes involved in the conversion of 4-coumarate to sinapate in the initial reactions of the phenylpropanoid pathway, as clone n04g <dig> , which showed a specific expression during infection as confirmed by northern hybridization . additional ests are related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of lignin, and also to that of other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds, such as anthocyanins and flavonoids, including enzymes involved in the modification or transport of these compounds, such as glycosyltransferases , or plant membrane abc transporters , which may participate in an active process to secrete defensive metabolites  <cit> .

it is recognized that the presence of secondary metabolites genes does not necessary imply the ability of a plant to produce those compounds  <cit> . however, it is also true that some of the alkaloids highlighted in this study have already been identified in citrus, as is the case of caffeine  <cit> . further investigations are required to determine the participation and significance of alkaloids in the response to fungal attack in citrus fruit by both compatible and non-compatible pathogens. we should bare in mind that p. digitatum is the most successful pathogen of citrus fruit. hence, it must be able to overcome the plethora of secondary metabolites that the fruit seems to synthesize in order to deter its progression. however, it remains to be elucidated whether these compounds play a role in non host-pathogen defense restricting the progress of pathogens that are not able to infect citrus fruit.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has identified a set of citrus genes that are preferentially upregulated in the rind of citrus fruit infected with p. digitatum with respect to mock-inoculated fruits. macroarray hybridization experiments have shown that approximately half of the genes responsive to p. digitatum infection are also responsive to wounding or ethylene, although some genes related to secondary metabolism are only induced upon pathogen challenge, such as those showing similarity to caffeine synthase, tropinone reductase or berberine bridge-like. overall results indicate that p. digitatum-infected citrus fruit redirect primary metabolism towards the synthesis of alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and isoprenes.
