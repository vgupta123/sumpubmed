BACKGROUND
a rapid dissemination of escherichia coli and others enterobacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases  has been reported in many european countries, including spain, and is a matter of major concern  <cit> . the blactx-m genes are becoming the most prevalent esbls encountered in enterobacteriaceae <cit> . the prevalent blactx-m-type genes in europe have been identified as blactx-m- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> <cit> . infections caused by enterobacteria producing esbl are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health-care associated costs  <cit> .

during recent years, extensive characterization of plasmid families  has provided additional information on epidemiological aspects of transmissible antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . many of these studies have focused on e. coli producing esbl  <cit> . from these studies, some plasmid families were demonstrated to be largely prevalent in enterobacteriaceae, emerging in association with specific esbl genes. for instance, the blactx-m- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> genes have often been located on plasmids belonging to the incf group  <cit>  and incl/m family  <cit>  respectively, in different countries  <cit> . it would be interesting to know if in a specific geographical area, plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance in multiresistant e. coli producing esbl is due to plasmids of the same incompatibility group as those present in other multirresistant isolates not producing esbl.

the objective of this study was to determine whether the clonal variability and content of plasmids, resistance genes and integrons of clinical isolates of e. coli producing esbl  were similar or not to those of e. coli isolates lacking esbl  isolated in the same geographical area and period.

RESULTS
phenotype of resistance and clonal relationship
mic <dig> and mic <dig> values of the different agents against the two groups of multiresistant e. coli are presented in table  <dig>  all ec-esbl were susceptible to cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin and tigecycline. according to the eucast  <cit> , all ec-esbl isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, 96% to cefepime, 96% to aztreonam and 23% to ceftazidime . moreover, 39% of the isolates belonging to the ec-esbl collection were co-resistant to quinolones, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

a clsi  <dig> breakpoints. b fda breakpoints.

all ec-mrnob were susceptible to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin and tigecycline. eight isolates in this collection were resistant to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin  . the most frequent phenotype of resistance observed among the selected ec-mrnob isolates included resistance to β-lactams , aminoglycosides , quinolones , tetracyclines  and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, occurring in 50% of the studied isolates. all other possible combinations of co-resistances among the selected isolates represented no more than 5% of the isolates.

most ec-esbl were of phylogroup b <dig> , followed by groups a , d  and b <dig> . in contrast, the most frequent phylogenetic group of ec-mrnob was d , followed by groups a , b <dig>  and b <dig> .

the  <dig> ec-esbl isolates were grouped in  <dig> rep-pcr patterns. in this group, only  <dig> rep-pcr patterns included  <dig> or more isolates: patterns xxxi  and xxii . the remaining patterns contained  <dig> to  <dig> isolates  or single isolates . lower clonal variability was noted among the ec-mrnob, which were grouped into  <dig> rep-pcr patterns. three patterns included  <dig> or more isolates: i-nb , ii-nb  and xxiii-nb . fifteen patterns included  <dig> to  <dig> isolates, and the remaining  <dig> patterns corresponded to single isolates.

comparison of rep-pcr patterns corresponding to isolates of the two e. coli collections showed the presence of ec-esbl  and ec-mrnob  with the same pattern. pfge analysis confirmed this relationship, with isolates presenting identical or similar  pfge patterns. in addition, clonally related isolates  were included in the same st defined by mlst .

twenty-four st were identified among the isolates selected for the conjugation assay , of which seven types included both ec-esbl and ec-mrnob, while  <dig> and  <dig> types included either ec-esbl or ec-mrnob, respectively. three new st  were first identified among our ec-esbl isolates.

atotal number of isolates belonging to the indicated rep-pcr pattern.

plasmid profile
one or more plasmids were observed in organisms of the two e. coli collections. for the  <dig> ec-esbl isolates the most frequently detected replicons were repfib , repfii , repcole , repk  and repi <dig> . other replicons  were detected in  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the isolates . among the  <dig> ec-mrnob,  <dig> major replicon types were detected: repfib , repfii , repfia  and repcole . furthermore, positive results were detected in some of these isolates for other replicons, including repi <dig>  repy, repp, repb/o, repa/c, repr and repk .

ec-esbl and ec-mrnob isolates differed significantly in the presence of  <dig> replicons: repk , repfii  and repcole  were more frequent among ec-esbl isolates, while repfia  and repa/c  were more frequent among ec-mrnob isolates.

nineteen esbl-producing transconjugants were obtained from the  <dig> ec-esbl isolates selected for the conjugations assays . all transconjugants contained one or more plasmids. the more frequently detected replicons in the  <dig> transconjugants were: repk , repfii , repi <dig>  and repp . with the three selective media used, transconjugants were obtained from  <dig> out of the  <dig> ec-mrnob isolates selected for conjugation assays . in all,  <dig> transconjugants were analysed, including  <dig> selected with ampicillin, which contained replicons repi <dig> , repfib , repfii  and repfia ,  <dig> selected with gentamicin  and three selected with sulfamethoxazole, .

detection of resistance genes in wild-type strains and transconjugants
in the  <dig> ec-esbl isolates, genes coding for the following esbl were detected: blactx-m- <dig> , blashv- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blashv- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig>  and blatem- <dig> . in addition, tem- <dig> was detected in  <dig>  isolates. no positive pcr results were obtained in this collection for genes coding for plasmid-mediated ampc-β-lactamases. the esbl genes produced by the  <dig> obtained transconjugants were: blactx-m- <dig> , blactx-m- <dig> , blashv- <dig>  and blatem- <dig> . hybridization assays showed that the gene coding for ctx-m- <dig> was mobilizable by inck plasmids. moreover, the rflp of plasmids from  <dig> inck-ctx-m- <dig> showed the same restriction pattern in  <dig> isolates  .

amoxicillin resistance in the  <dig> ec-mrnob isolates was related to genes coding for tem- <dig> , shv- <dig> , shv- <dig>  or oxa- <dig> . the relationship between amoxicillin resistance and tem- <dig> production in these organisms was confirmed by detecting the corresponding gene in  <dig> out the  <dig>  obtained transconjugants. the ec-mrnob resistant to both extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin contained the gene coding for cmy- <dig>  which was included in inca/c plasmids, as confirmed by hybridization assays.

none of the  <dig> ec-esbl or the  <dig> ec-mrnob contained any of the studied plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes.

in the  <dig> ec-esbl isolates, class  <dig>  class  <dig> or class  <dig> plus class  <dig> integrons were detected in  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % isolates, respectively . similarly, for the  <dig> ec-mrnob, positive results for class  <dig>  class  <dig>  and class  <dig> plus class  <dig> integrons were obtained for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the isolates . the gene cassette arrays found in class  <dig> integrons for both e. coli collections are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
this study presents comparative information about the microbiological characteristics of two groups of multiresistant clinical isolates of e. coli , recovered in the same geographical and temporal context.

analysis of rep-pcr shows a wide clonal distribution among ec-esbl isolates and to a lesser extent among ec-mrnob isolates. this variability indicates that, in our area, multiresistance in e. coli is not always caused by the expansion of only one or a few clones, but it is often caused by the presence of multiple independent strains. the diversity of e. coli strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase has been previously reported in a nationwide study in spain  <cit> . in addition, mlst also showed evidences of small clusters of strains belonging to clonal complexes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> or to the sequence types  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all these clonal groups have been previously described  <cit>  as involved in the spread of certain genes coding for esbls and other resistance mechanisms.

isolates belonging to the st354cplx have been related worldwide to the spread of esbls of the ctx-m family, associated with the presence of plasmids of different incompatibility groups  <cit> . in spain, mora et al.  <cit>  have reported an increased prevalence of strains of st <dig> producing ctx-m- <dig>  however, in our study, the st <dig> isolates do not produce an esbl.

the esbl-producing isolates of the st10cplx contained either inck or inci <dig> plasmids, as also described by other authors  <cit> . inci <dig> plasmids have previously been identified in strains of human origin  and in the commensal bacterial flora of diseased animals  <cit> . st10cplx isolates were also identified among non-esbl detected in our study, but they did not contain inci <dig> plasmids.

it has been previously demonstrated that e. coli o25:h4-st <dig> is associated to the pandemic dissemination of the ctx-m- <dig> enzyme but this clone was also prevalent in healthy subjects from different european countries  <cit> . in a recent study on  <dig> consecutive extraintestinal e. coli isolates cultured in  <dig>  the st <dig> clone represented 9% of all e. coli and about 25% of all multiresistant isolates in our centre  <cit> . in the current study, st <dig> strains were also identified in both ec-esbl and ec-mrnob isolates.

ctx-m- <dig> was the most frequent esbl identified in our ec-esbl isolates. in most cases the gene coding for this enzyme was in inck plasmids and less frequently in an inci <dig> plasmid, in agreement with a previous spanish report  <cit> . moreover, the inck plasmids identified in this study showed identical restriction patterns , which suggest that the transmission of ctx-m- <dig> in our sanitary area is due to a specific plasmid belonging to this incompatibility group. other reports have also shown the importance of ctx-m- <dig> in other countries, that was disseminated associated to incfii plasmids  <cit> .

the detection of both inck and inci <dig> plasmids in the ec-mrnob collection indicates that these mobile elements are not only important for esbl dispersion, but may also be relevant for the transmission of other resistance mechanism, as suggested in previous reports  <cit> . on the other hand, resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins associated to the production of the cephamycinase cmy- <dig> in the ec-mrnob was related to a different group of plasmids, namely those of the inca/c group. inca/c plasmids coding for cmy- <dig> have also been previously described in e. coli and salmonella enterica isolates  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> isolates were resistant to ceftazidime but they did not present plasmid-mediated ampc β-lactamases, we presume that hyperproduction of ampc was due to mutation in the promotor or the attenuator of the corresponding gene, as observed previously by others authors  <cit> .

plasmid typing showed that the dichotomous distribution of ctx-m- <dig> and cmy- <dig> among the two e. coli groups corresponded to an unequal distribution of two plasmid types associated to these enzymes: the a/c plasmids carrying cmy- <dig> were unique to the ecmrnob group, while the inck plasmids carrying ctx-m- <dig> were related to the ec-esbl group.

interestingly, other plasmid species were common and highly represented in the two groups of isolates: incf, cole and inci <dig>  the high prevalence of incf plasmids in both ec-esbl and ec-mrnob clearly indicates that this plasmid species is very well adapted in resistant e. coli strains independently of their resistance phenotype. a recent report has demonstrated that f replicons  were the most frequently detected replicon types in e. coli strains producing or not producing esbl  <cit> . replicons of the incf type were detected in 50% of e. coli from faeces of healthy, antibiotic-free humans and faecal flora from healthy birds in the usa, confirming that this plasmid type can be highly represented in e. coli populations also including susceptible strains  <cit> . similarly, inci <dig> plasmids have also been detected in e. coli from faecal flora of healthy humans and animals  <cit> . finally, cole plasmids are small, high copy number, not self-conjugative, producing bacteriocins, whose prevalence is not well estimated in recent collections of enterobacteriaceae.

several studies  <cit>  have indicated that extraintestinal e. coli isolates are more commonly of phylogenetic groups b <dig> and d than of groups a and b <dig>  in our series, groups d and b <dig> were more frequent in the ec-mrnob collection than in the ec-esbl. the decreased level of resistance among isolates of group b <dig> reported in some studies  <cit>  was not observed in our case, as per definition all isolates were multiresistant. although multiple studies indicate that use of fluoroquinolones is an independent factor for infections by multiresistant e. coli, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were not found among the isolates we have studied. the most likely explanation for quinolone resistance in our isolates is the presence of chromosomal mutations in their gyrase and topoisomerase iv genes.

in addition to the indicated resistance genes, we have found that the clinical isolates of multiresistant e. coli in our health area carry different classes of integrons. ec-mrnob showed a higher presence of these elements in comparison with the isolates belonging to the ec-esbl collection but, in both cases, the class  <dig> integrons containing dfra17-antie or dfra1-ant-ia genes were the most frequent ones. the implication of these elements in the spread of resistance in spain  <cit>  has been previously documented.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has shown that, in our area, multiresistant e. coli producing either esbl or other mechanisms of resistance are clonally diverse, although small clusters of related strains are also found. while both ec-esbl and ecmrnob frequently contained incfi plasmids, plasmids usually related to the most frequently detected esbl , are uncommonly found in strains lacking this enzyme.
