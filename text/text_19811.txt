BACKGROUND
during the last two decades single chain fv  antibodies have become widely applied in research, diagnostics and therapeutic settings  <cit> . these recombinant, antigen-binding molecules can be engineered  <cit>  to modulate their specificity  <cit>  affinity  <cit>  and pharmacokinetics  <cit>  as well as appending novel effector functions  <cit>  established technology allows investigators to produce large and diverse combinatorial scfv libraries commonly using minor coat protein  filamentous phage display in escherichia coli   <cit> . during production of phage-scfvs, the scfv-piii fusion is translocated to the periplasmic space and remains anchored in the cytosolic membrane by the c-terminal hydrophobic extension of piii  <cit> . the fusion protein then assembles with nascent phage particles as they extrude from the inner membrane.

overall levels of scfv expression, as with all proteins, are dependant on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational level gene regulation. it has been shown that 47% of the variation in e. coli protein abundance is accounted for by mrna abundance alone and codon-bias and codon adaptation indices account for a major proportion of the remaining variation  <cit> . expression yield often refers to the level of soluble protein produced in the e. coli which may be located in the periplasm or in culture supernatant. high thermodynamic stability, high molecular weight, increased hydrophobicity and areas of low sequence complexity are linked to poor soluble protein expression yields  <cit> . such properties can lead to proteins being more susceptible to proteolytic degradation  <cit>  aggregation and inclusion body formation in either the cytosol  <cit>  or periplasmic space  <cit> . disulphide-rich proteins may also be prone to mis-folding once in the periplasm  <cit> .

there is a multitude of research demonstrating that improvements in soluble expression yields in either the periplasm or supernatant can typically be gained by approaches including removal of detrimental hydrophobic residues  <cit> , alteration of leader sequence  <cit> , co-expression or over-expression of cytosolic or periplasmic chaperones  <cit>  or modifying induction conditions such as inducer concentration, temperature or time  <cit> .

some processes affecting soluble protein expression yield also have bearing upon phage display. in phagemid vector systems  <cit>  the protein-piii fusion is targeted to the periplasm in the same manner as non-fused protein as they share the same leader sequence. proteins refractory to secyeg-mediated periplasmic translocation therefore tend to display poorly in standard phage display systems, elegantly shown for darpins which have very high thermodynamic stability and are prone to premature folding and aggregation in the cytosol post-translationally  <cit> . display levels and periplasmic localisation were drastically improved when the leader sequence was altered for utilisation of the co-translational translocation signal recognition particle pathway which does not allow premature folding or aggregation. this study concluded that when comparing a diverse range of proteins, overall expression level may not correlate with phage display propensity but soluble periplasmic levels do.

there is little data available indicating how overall protein expression level relates to display propensity in the absence of dysfunctional cytosolic-periplasmic protein translocation. the scfv, which is known for its lower thermodynamic stability  <cit>  tends not to prematurely fold in the cytosol of bacteria and is amenable to display and localisation to the periplasm regardless of whether a post or co-translational translocation approach is used  <cit> . comparing a panel of scfvs in terms of overall protein expression and phage display propensity allows the link between the two characteristics to be investigated.

we used phage display to select scfvs against the recombinant c-terminal domain of the tetanus toxin heavy chain   from a cambridge antibody technology library containing  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> clones  <cit> . after two rounds of display we isolated many hc-specific clones exhibiting complimentarity determining region  diversity . the scfvs consist of an n-terminal secyeg translocon signal sequence   <cit>  and c-terminal hexa-histidine  and c-myc tags. we sought to compare the phage display properties of  <dig> anti-hc scfvs  in the suppressor strain of e. coli xl1-blue with their facility of expression as non-fused scfvs in the non-suppressor strain hb <dig>  we observed a strong level of positive correlation between relative overall non-fused scfv expression and relative display level propensity.

RESULTS
phage display propensity of scfvs is a variable and clone-specific characteristic
phage from e. coli xl1-blue cultures harbouring  <dig> different anti-hc scfvs were made, concentrated, purified and quantified by uv spectroscopy . equal numbers of phage particles were blotted onto nitrocellulose following electrophoretic separation. all phage-scfv fusions were probed with either a monoclonal anti-piii igg antibody  or monoclonal anti-his <dig> igg antibody . the helper phage only control showed a dominant band migrating at approximately  <dig> kda with a variety of commonly observed smaller mw weight products, the result of proteolytic degradation. the  <dig> anti-hc phage fusions showed a dominant piii signal at  <dig> kda, that was consistent from clone to clone indicating uniform loading of phage particles displaying each of the anti-hc scfvs and a less dominant higher mw band migrating at  <dig> kda, the density of which varied from clone to clone. anti-his <dig> immuno-detection for the  <dig> anti-hc scfvs varied in intensity from clone to clone and was often observed in two bands at both  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda. based on the distribution and signal of piii and his <dig> bands it is possible to conclude that the  <dig> kda bands in figure 1a solely represent full-length scfv fused to full length piii. the  <dig> kda bands are likely to be due to both wild-type piii  and piii appended to the his <dig> tag of the scfv only . the remainder of the scfv molecule may have been cleaved away by proteolytic activity. it may also be possible that the  <dig> kda species represents full length scfv fused to degraded piii . it is also worth noting that previous investigations reveal unexpected electrophoretic migration of piii due to its high glycine content, extended shape and multi-domain structure leading to differences between calculated and expected molecular weights and this may have contributed to the results observed here  <cit> .

quantitative laser scanning densitometry was used to measure the intensity of the chemiluminescent signal produced by the western blot analyses . the total signal obtained from both the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda anti-his <dig> signals was used as a measure of display. regardless of whether the full length scfv is present, detection of the his <dig> tag logically dictates display of that scfv protein on phage. this takes into account degradation . data analysis was conducted using the aida image analyser software and the absolute intensities were corrected for local background signal and normalised for phage loading  and then used to produce relative rankings of scfv display propensity for three independently produced batches of phage . an elisa platform was used to support the display level data obtained by western blot . coating of neat, peg-purified phage  without prior od normalisation was amenable with this assay platform since variation in titre, as indicated by differences in piii signal, could be accounted for by obtaining a ratio of his <dig> to piii od <dig> values and this was used to produce display rankings.

three independently-produced batches of the  <dig> anti-hc phage-scfvs were analysed by both the western blot and elisa method described above. average rankings from  <dig>  to  <dig>   were used to conduct a spearmans correlation analysis comparing rankings obtained between phage-scfv batches and between the two measurement techniques. ranks correlated well between batches and techniques  with clones showing strong anti-his <dig> western blot signals also showing high anti-his6:anti-piii elisa ratios . thus display level appears to be a non-batch dependent but clone-specific characteristic and varies markedly between clones in a panel of  <dig> anti-hc scfvs.

densitometry data derived from the western blots shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> were used to rank scfvs from  <dig> to  <dig> in order of highest to lowest levels of scfv respectively. rankings from repeat experiments were averaged and are shown here along with standard error for the overall expression and display levels. the average relative spheroplast scfv level rankings were used as an indicator of overall expression level and to designate the scfvs into three groups of either "high ", "medium  " or "low"  expression. rankings for phage display propensity were also used to assign similar groupings. the major vh and vl germline designations for each scfv are also shown for each clone.

this variability in display level was not unexpected given that these clones were derived after only  <dig> rounds of selection on the hc antigen . such differences in display level may have implications in selections such that scfvs exhibiting a higher display level may be preferentially enriched in the absence of vastly differing affinities. given that scfvs have been shown to be relatively resistant to premature cytosolic folding/aggregation  <cit> , we hypothesised that the display level variation shown here is due to variation in the overall expression level of the scfvs with the reasonable assumption that facility for translocation to the periplasm is uniform amongst the  <dig> clones.

overall scfv expression does not correlate with soluble levels in the periplasm and culture supernatant
we found that the overall level of scfv expression defined as levels measured by western blot in the spheroplast fraction of e. coli hb <dig> does not correlate with soluble levels in the periplasmic or culture supernatant fractions after  <dig> hr culture induction.

spheroplast, periplasmic and supernatant fractions were isolated from the cultures at the end of the  <dig> hr induction period following normalisation of the culture density of each clone. fractionated samples were electrophoresed and transferred onto nitrocellulose for probing with an anti-his <dig> antibody . the supernatant and periplasmic fractions of each anti-hc scfv exhibited a single band at approximately  <dig> kda indicating fully processed scfv. the spheroplast fractions of most scfvs contained doublet bands at approximately  <dig> kda, likely to represent both n-terminally processed and unprocessed scfv in addition to smaller breakdown products. the absolute signals vary markedly between scfv clones in each of the three fractions. quantitative laser scanning densitometry measurements of western blot chemiluminescence were acquired  and used to rank scfvs from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in order of densitometry signals for levels of scfv present in the e. coli spheroplast, periplasmic lysate and culture supernatant. the overall rankings were reproducible between data sets  for the same e. coli compartment indicating that overall scfv expression  and localisation to the periplasm and culture supernatant in soluble form are clone-specific characteristics, that vary from clone to clone.

average rankings were produced for each compartment using independently produced data sets  and these were used to conduct a spearmans correlation test in order to determine if relative levels of scfv present within the three fractions correlate with each other for each clone. for n =  <dig>  a rho value greater than  <dig>  indicates positive correlation with a p-value of less than or equal to  <dig> . however, comparison of supernatant scfv levels with periplasmic or spheroplast levels yielded coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. comparison of periplasmic and spheroplast levels yielded a coefficient of  <dig> . these data suggest there is no significant correlation  between the overall expression level of a scfv molecule as defined by its spheroplast level, and its relative soluble levels within the periplasmic space or culture supernatant.

interestingly in three independent experiments the final culture density, as determined by od <dig> after a  <dig> hr induction, reached a value reproducibly characteristic to the clone being studied ranging from  <dig>  for c <dig> to  <dig>  for n <dig> . relative increases in culture density following induction were calculated using the mean culture density data shown in figure 2d. the relative increases were used to rank the scfvs from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and used to determine spearmans correlation coefficients in pair-wise comparisons with spheroplast, periplasmic and culture supernatant scfv level rankings. although there was no detectable correlation between relative increase in culture density ranking and spheroplast or periplasmic scfv level rankings, there was a moderate but statistically significant negative correlation  when compared with culture supernatant scfv levels. thus scfv clones that exhibit a low relative level of culture supernatant localisation allow the bacteria harbouring them to attain a higher culture density than other scfvs.

given that scfvs are not prone to cytosolic aggregation, the lack of correlation between the spheroplast and periplasmic levels of scfv may be explained by differential toxicity once in the periplasm. our culture density data suggests that some scfvs are more toxic than others and that clones with a high level of supernatant localisation hinder bacterial growth following induction, perhaps through lytic mechanisms or destabilisation of the outer membrane. this non-uniform differential soluble scfv localisation therefore directly influences any correlation between supernatant levels and periplasm, and supernatant/periplasm with spheroplast levels. differing levels of toxicity may be due to periplasmic aggregation and hence inclusion body formation, proteolytic breakdown or mis-folding due to inappropriate disulphide bond formation which has been observed previously for scfvs  <cit> .

phage display propensity exhibits strong positive correlation with overall scfv expression levels
the average relative scfv rankings for display level propensity were compared with the expression analysis of non-fused scfv. we found that display level ranking does not correlate with soluble scfv level rankings in either the periplasm  or supernatant . however, we found a strong positive correlation  between display level ranking and overall scfv expression ranking as defined by relative spheroplastic levels, illustrated in figure  <dig>  based on the ranking data, scfv clones were grouped into 'high', 'medium' or 'low' for phage display propensity and overall expression levels . display ranking was achieved using two independent methods on three independent batches of material and was remarkable consistent . the average ranking was at worst, only varied by  <dig> places . total expression ranking was also very consistent with clone c <dig> being the most variable. taking all factors into account, we believe this to be a robust and strong correlation.

this interesting correlation provides insight into the possible mechanism leading to a lack of correlation between overall scfv expression and soluble levels in the periplasm and supernatant. assembly of piii-scfv fusion proteins into phage particles is dependant upon their translocation to the periplasm  <cit> . since overall expression level correlates strongly with display level, it may be concluded that few of these scfv clones exhibit a marked level of premature folding or degradation in the bacterial cytosol that may hinder their translocation to the periplasm. any degree of premature folding may be assumed to be uniform amongst the  <dig> clones since the only factor influencing display level is simply the absolute level of scfv expressed in the bacterial cytosol. given that scfv expression in both piii-fused and non-fused forms share the same secretary signal sequence it can be assumed that both are trafficked to the periplasm in an identical manner. we would therefore expect levels of soluble scfv in the periplasm to correlate with overall expression level and display level. this was not the case.

a hypothetical explanation for the observed disparity therefore potentially lies in the fact that the fates of piii fused and non-fused scfvs diverge once the proteins are translocated across the inner membrane of e. coli. the piii-scfv fusion remains anchored in the inner membrane via the c-terminal domain of piii  <cit>  whereas free scfv remains in the periplasmic space where it is subject to potential mis-folding or aggregation. we propose that differential levels of aggregation between clones at this stage leads to varying degrees of membrane destabilisation and therefore leaking of scfv into the supernatant.

codon usage indirectly influences scfv phage display propensity
the link between total protein expression and phage display is supported by bioinformatics analyses. a number of factors influence translation efficiency, codon usage being an important parameter  <cit> . one codon usage index is the codon adaptation index   <cit>  which was determined using the codonw programme  <cit> . ranking of the cai correlates with overall expression and hence phage display . at the nucleotide level, the scfv sequences are similar  and the cai covers a small range, suggesting that minor differences in codons could account for large differences in display and expression. the improbizer program  <cit>  was used to search for dna motifs which could be linked to high expression. however, many motifs were identified and given the similar nucleotide backgrounds, it was impossible to deduce which ones could be of significance and which ones were signatures of the v-gene sequences. a similar protein sequence analysis failed to identify any protein motifs which correlate with phage display propensity. this confirms that phage display of scfvs is closely and significantly linked to overall protein expression and not post-translational protein-orientated events such as folding. there is a great deal of research detailing protein sequence motifs which affect functional protein expression, particularly recombinant antibodies  <cit> . this is likely to affect the levels of scfv found in the supernatant. antibody v-domains are generally homologous with a consensus homology of approximately 50%  <cit> . the data in this study comprises v-domains ranging from highly similar sequences to around 60% homology . given that even a single residue change can influence major biophysical properties  <cit> , making observations with highly similar sequences is still valid for this comparative analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, when premature protein folding in the bacterial cytosol is not a factor, phage display levels correlate with overall expression level. higher levels of synthesised protein result in greater levels of inner membrane translocation and incorporation into phage particles. therefore, factors influencing overall expression indirectly influence phage display propensity. this suggests that better scfv display could be achieved in codon-optimised strains of e. coli such as those commercially available or in vectors with very strong promoters such as the t7-promoter system. however, high levels of overall expression may not necessarily imply high levels of soluble localisation to the periplasm or supernatant. this may influence selection of clones for further study after phage display suggesting that a parallel screen of periplasmic or supernatant levels should be conducted in order to select clones that exhibit a desirable high soluble yield in addition to phage elisas. the work also shows how scfv display level and expression can vary considerably amongst clones despite an overall high level of sequence homology.

materials and methods
production and isolation of phage-scfv fusions
a description of the selection and full characterisation of these  <dig> anti-tetanus toxin scfvs is in preparation . all scfvs were selected on plastic immobilised recombinant tetanus toxin hc-domain using nunc immunotubes at high antigen concentrations. this allowed selection of a diverse array of binders with no selection pressure on affinity, display or expression.

the amber suppressor xl1-blue strain of escherichia coli  was transformed  <cit>  with the phagemid vector pcantab <dig>  <cit>  encoding each of the fifteen anti-hc scfvs c1â€“c <dig>  n1â€“n <dig> and j1â€“j <dig> under the control of the lac promoter. individual transformant colonies of each scfv clone were selected and grown for  <dig> hours in a  <dig> ml culture of 2ty  <cit>  containing  <dig> Î¼g/ml carbenicillin,  <dig> Î¼g/ml tetracycline and 1% glucose, with shaking at  <dig> rpm. the cultures were sub-cultured, after removal of old medium, at a 1: <dig> ratio into  <dig> ml of fresh medium and grown at 37Â°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. at an od <dig> of  <dig> â€“ <dig> , the phagemid containing bacteria were infected with vcsm <dig> helper phage  at a multiplicity of infection of 20: <dig>  <cit> . infection was allowed to take place for  <dig> minutes at 37Â°c without shaking followed by a further  <dig> minutes at 37Â°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. the bacteria were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in  <dig> ml of 2ty containing  <dig> Î¼g/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> Î¼g/ml kanamycin. the cultures were incubated overnight at 30Â°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. the culture supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and filtered through a  <dig>  Î¼m membrane. a third volume of ice-cold 20% polyethylene glycol  <dig> containing  <dig>  m nacl was mixed with the phage containing supernatant and the solution incubated for  <dig> hours at 4Â°c. precipitated phage were isolated by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hour at 4Â°c and resuspended in commercial phosphate buffered saline   to a volume one tenth the original culture volume. a final centrifuge step at  <dig>  rpm was used to remove any debris. phage titre was estimated for each phage-scfv clone using uv spectroscopy   <cit> .

expression of non-fused scfv and isolation of spheroplast, periplasmic and supernatant fractions
the dna encoding the fifteen anti-hc scfvs in phagemid pcantab <dig> were transformed into the hb <dig>  strain of e. coli which produces only scfv rather than a mixture of non-fused scfv and scfv-piii fusion since translation terminates at the amber tag codon separating the two genes. the clones were grown for  <dig> hours at 37Â°c in 2ty broth containing 1% glucose and  <dig> Î¼g/ml carbenicillin with shaking at  <dig> rpm. after removal of old medium the cells were sub-cultured at a 1: <dig> ratio into  <dig> ml of fresh medium and grown to an od <dig> of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  at 37Â°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm  <cit> . at this point the bacteria were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in  <dig> ml of 2ty medium containing  <dig> Î¼g/ml carbenicillin and  <dig> mm iptg to induce expression of the non-fused scfv genes. the cultures were incubated overnight at 30Â°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm. the od <dig> was measured at the end of this period and the culture volumes adjusted with 2ty broth in order to normalise the bacterial density to that of the lowest clone. the cultures were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hour at 4Â°c and the supernatant retained. the bacterial pellets were re-suspended in ice-cold periplasmic extraction buffer containing  <dig> mm sucrose  <dig> mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm edta ph  <dig>   <cit> . the volume of buffer used was one-tenth the final od normalised volume. the resuspended bacteria were mixed by vortexing for  <dig> seconds every  <dig> minutes for  <dig> minutes in order to break open the outer membrane of the bacteria. spheroplasts were then isolated by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes at 4Â°c and the supernatant  retained. the spheroplast containing pellet was re-suspended in distilled h <dig> at one-tenth the volume of od normalised culture volume.

measurement of phage display levels and non-fused scfv expression using western blot with quantitative laser scanning densitometry analysis
for measurement of phage display propensity, equal numbers of phage displaying each of the  <dig> scfv clones and a helper phage control were subject to reducing sds-page and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. each clone and the helper phage were probed with a murine anti-piii antibody  followed by a goat anti-mouse hrpo secondary. simultaneously the samples were probed with hrpo conjugated murine anti-his <dig> antibody . the detection of piii is a measure of total phage present and the measurement of the his <dig> tag indicates levels of scfv displayed. in the case of non-fused scfv, the supernatant , periplasmic  and supernatant  fractions were subjected to reducing sds-page and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. probing with anti-his <dig> hrpo was used to measure the scfv levels. in both the case of measuring levels of scfv fused to phage and of non-fused scfv, western blots were developed using the ecl plus western blotting detection system. chemiluminescent signals were detected and measured using quantitative laser scanning densitometry   facilitated with the aida biopackage image analyser software . absolute signal intensities derived from the chemiluminescent signal were corrected for local background signal and used to produce a relative ranking of scfv display level and levels of non-fused scfv in spheroplast, periplasm and supernatant.

measurement of scfv display level by elisa
as an additional measurement of scfv levels on phage, an elisa methodology was used. undiluted phage  were coated onto 96-well maxisorp nunc-immunoplates. following a blocking step with marvelâ„¢ dried milk powder piii and his <dig> immunodetection were facilitated with the antibodies used during the western blot procedure. the assay was developed using bm-blue pod substrate and stopped with  <dig> m hcl. binding signal  was measured using a spectramax 340pc plate reader. a ratio of piii to his <dig> od <dig> values was used as an indication of relative display level to account for variation in phage titre and rankings were produced accordingly.

statistical analyses
statistical assessment including derivation of means and standard errors was carried out using the sigma plot software version  <dig>  . comparison of scfv rankings between different sample sets was facilitated through calculation of the spearmans coefficient of rank correlation parameter  which shows the degree of correlation and its statistical significance.
