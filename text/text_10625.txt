BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic disorders that commonly affect individuals in the second to third decades of life. they are relatively common in the northern hemisphere, and are also being increasingly recognized in the developing world. a number of different genetic mutations are associated with these diseases, and typically result in a dysregulated immune response to the bacteria residing within the host gut  <cit> . the inflammatory response in ibd is characterized by an influx of lymphocytes, monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which can all mediate chronic tissue damage. tumor necrosis factor alpha  appears to be a key factor in this process, as neutralization of this critical cytokine is highly efficacious in treating both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  <cit> .

integrin-linked kinase  is an adapter protein that links the extracellular matrix with the cell interior through its interactions with the cytoplasmic tails of certain integrins. ilk plays a critical role in development, as its knockdown results in failure of implantation of the trophoblast. when ilk is deleted in specific tissues, processes such as cardiac development; angiogenesis; cartilage growth; skin growth; gut development and t-cell migration can all be impaired  <cit> . ilk also has an important role in cancer since it has oncogenic properties when overexpressed in cancer cell lines, and high ilk expression in a variety of malignancies is associated with a negative prognosis  <cit> . there is controversy surrounding its ability to regulate the activity of protein kinase b/akt, but recent findings indicate that ilk acts in concert with other molecules such as pinch and rictor to achieve this effect  <cit> .

there is scant data as yet on the role of ilk in inflammation. although t cell-specific deletion of ilk did not establish a role in t cell proliferation, impaired migration was described  <cit> . we have previously observed that mice with a conditional epithelial cell knockout of ilk develop smaller tumors, in response to chronic inflammation associated with exposure to azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate administration  <cit>  suggesting that ilk may regulate inflammation. in order to investigate this hypothesis we investigated the role of epithelial cell-specific expression of ilk in acute and chronic models of colitis. we report that ilk-ko mice are significantly protected from colitis; protection from disease is associated with altered expression of the chemokine, ccl <dig>  and fibronectin. moreover, ilk-ko mice have increased numbers of mucosal tregs, consistent with the finding that fibronectin can directly impact on t regulatory cell development in vitro.

immunohistochemistry
paraffin-embedded colonic tissue samples were de-waxed in xylene twice for  <dig> min, rehydrated in a series of ethanol  for  <dig> min each followed by rehydration in pbs for  <dig> min. after rehydration the endogenous peroxidase was blocked with  <dig> % hydrogen peroxide followed by antigen retrieval by microwaving sections in citrate buffer ph  <dig>  . following antigen retrieval, the sections were washed three times with pbs, blocked in 1% bsa for  <dig> h, and then stained using the vectastain abc kit  mentioned below according to manufacturer's recommendations but with the following modifications. sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4°c overnight: ilk , fibronectin , anti-foxp <dig> , anti-cd <dig> . following incubation, the sections were rinsed three consecutive times with pbs and then incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for  <dig> h followed by incubation with peroxidase-labelled streptavidin. nova -red and dab were used as the chromagens, and the sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. three blinded observers independently examined all stained sections.

for detection of th <dig> cells by immunofluorescence, the slides were processed as for ihc and the following antibodies were used: dapi and il-17a . sections were stained with vectastain abc elite kit and biotinylated ant-rabbit for dapi, or efluor <dig> nanocrystal conjugation kit, cat no. 88-7072- <dig> antibody, and avidin d-fitc  used for immunofluorescence . each section had its own control using the secondary antibody only. pre-immune serum was initially used to ensure specificity of the signal with each of the antibodies.

determination of regulatory t cell numbers and intracellular cytokine staining
to quantify tregs and ifn-γ production ex vivo, mesenteric lymph nodes were collected, and stimulated with with phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin  for  <dig> h in the presence of brefeldin a  during the final  <dig> h. cells were fixed and permeabilised using foxp3-specific kit reagents  and stained with anti-ifn-γ-pecy- <dig> , anti-tnf-α-pe  or anti-il-17-apc  . all samples were read on a bd facs canto and analyzed with fcs express v <dig> . to assess treg development in vitro, t cells were purified and cultured in sfem medium , supplemented with  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> mm glutamine,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate,  <dig> mm mem non-essential amino acid solution and  <dig> u/ml each of penicillin g and streptomycin. flat-bottom plates were coated with acd <dig>  and serial dilutions of the indicated concentration of fibronectin . tregs were differentiated from cd4+cd25- t cells in the absence or presence of soluble cd <dig> , rhil- <dig>  and rhtgf-β  as indicated.

statistical analysis
all macroscopic and histological disease scores, as well as cytokine levels were expressed as mean + sd, with p <  <dig>  being considered significant using the student's t-test . where indicated anova was performed with tukey post-hoc testing.

RESULTS
epithelial cell specific expression of ilk is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli in a pi3-kinase and stress-activated protein kinase-dependent manner
we first used an in vitro system to determine whether ilk expression is modulated by inflammatory stimuli. sw <dig> colonic cells were exposed to lps, and after  <dig> h ilk protein was induced, along with an increase in phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig>  expression of akt itself did not change . to confirm these findings in vivo, colonic explants were exposed to dss and as seen in figure 1b, this also led to an increase in expression ilk protein expression. histological examination of tissue sections demonstrated that increased ilk expression occurred both in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the epithelial cell compartment . ilk expression was regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, as both ly <dig> and wortmannin were capable of downregulating its induction at the protein level when hct <dig> cells were stimulated with interleukin  <dig> beta . regulation of its induction occurs transcriptionally, as the same inhibitors attenuated the induction of ilk mrna . in order to determine whether other pathways were also implicated, we observed that both of the stress-activated protein kinase inhibitors sp <dig> and sb <dig> were also capable of a similar downregulation .

ilk regulates weight loss and inflammation in acute dss-induced colitis
evidence that ilk is highly expressed in inflammation at mucosal surfaces suggests it may be important in modulating gut immunity. this notion is supported by our previous observations in the colitis-associated cancer model  <cit> , where ilk-ko mice had reduced inflammation-induced tumors. hence we initially examined whether ilk-ko mice differed from their littermate controls in a model of acute colitis. wild type and ilk-ko mice were treated with  <dig> % dss and at the end of  <dig> days  there was a clear difference in the degree of weight loss observed in the ilk-ko mice as compared with the wild-type group. by the end of the second week these mice have recovered from the acute insult and hence the difference is no longer apparent. histological examination confirmed the weight loss data since there was a significant attenuation of the inflammatory response in the ilk-ko mice .

ilk regulates the capacity of epithelial cells to produce ccl <dig> in vitro
because of the reduced inflammatory cell infiltrate in the ilk-ko mice, we postulated that ilk regulates the ability of epithelial cells to express pro-inflammatory mediators. hence we investigated the ability of si-rna mediated knockdown of ilk to affect the expression of inflammatory-cytokine induced production of chemokines. as the data in figure  <dig> indicate, exposure of hct <dig> cells to il-1β induces expression of il- <dig> , rantes  and mcp <dig> , but not mig . predictably, il-1β also induces both iκbα and i-nos. ilk knockdown had no effect on either il-1β-induced cxcl <dig> or ccl <dig> expression but significantly inhibited the expression of ccl <dig>  these data were confirmed not only by si-rna to knockdown ilk and performing q-pcr for ccl <dig>  but also using a specific inhibitor of ilk signaling, qlt <dig>  <cit> , both of which resulted in reduced expression of ccl <dig> message . we also investigated another unrelated si-rna to knockdown ilk with similar effects on ccl <dig> expression . elisa further corroborated these results using the ilk inhibitor to detect il-1β generated ccl <dig> protein. after a  <dig> h or  <dig> h exposure to qlt <dig> there was a significant  reduction in il-1β-induced ccl <dig>  these findings indicate that ilk is potentially capable of regulating epithelial cell function by modulating the expression of a well-described immune cell chemoattractant.

expression of ilk in epithelial cells influences chronic gut inflammation and production of ccl <dig> in vivo
we next investigated the impact of loss of ilk in epithelial cells in a model of chronic colitis, as this is considered to be more representative of human ibd. in this model, mice were treated with  <dig> cycles of  <dig> % dss for  <dig> days followed by  <dig> days without dss treatment. as the weight chart indicates , with each successive round of dss there is a notable increasing separation between ilk-ko mice and wild-type mice. specifically, after  <dig> days the amount of weight loss in the ilk-ko mice was significantly less than that of their wild-type counterparts. when the animals were sacrificed we observed reduced macroscopic disease scores in the ilk-ko group. these data were confirmed upon examination of histological sections where ilk-ko mice had significantly reduced inflammation and mucosal damage . based on our finding that ilk regulates expression of ccl <dig>  we also measured expression of ccl <dig> mrna and confirmed significantly reduced expression in the ilk-ko mice . tissue homogenates examined for protein levels of ccl <dig> further confirmed these data . collectively these data indicate that ilk normally promotes intestinal inflammation, and that ilk-mediated regulation of ccl <dig> production by epithelial cells may be involved in this response.

interconnection between ilk and fibronectin
ccl <dig> is a chemokine with a role in mediating fibrosis in several systems, including the colon  <cit> . intriguingly, one of the interesting facets of ilk function is its capacity to affect modulation of the extracellular matrix component, fibronectin  <cit> . since fibronectin is associated with colitis and its expression levels undergo biphasic modulation during induction of inflammation and during healing  <cit> , we speculated that loss of ilk in epithelial cells may also have an impact on this protein. we initially asked whether fibronectin is capable of regulating ccl <dig> expression by cultured epithelial cells. by plating cells on tissue culture plates coated with increasing levels of fibronectin we observed that there was an increase in the amount of ccl <dig> detected in the medium by elisa . we also wanted to determine whether fibronectin regulates the expression of its receptor  and ilk. using the same in vitro system we found that fibronectin stimulated a dose-dependent increase in expression of ilk and α <dig>  peaking at  <dig> ug/ml . next, using immunohistochemistry we observed that there is an impressive reduction in fibronectin expression in the ilk-ko mice in comparison with the wild-type mice . we also determined that qlt <dig> was capable of preventing the fibronectin-mediated expression of α <dig> integrin . collectively, these data indicate the existence of a bidirectional pathway whereby an ilk-dependent mechanism is capable of regulating fibronectin expression levels in the ecm, which is itself capable of regulation ilk and its receptor α <dig> integrin, as well as ccl <dig>  by epithelial cells.

expression of ilk in epithelial cells affects the infiltrating t cell profile
we next investigated whether the development of t cell responses was altered in ilk-ko mice. first, we analyzed production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colonic homogenates of the chronic dss-induced colitis mice, and found that ilk-ko mice had significant reductions  in their levels of tnf-α, ifn-γ and il-12p <dig> . to specifically address the cytokine profiles within the t cell compartment, mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and intracellular staining was performed on cd4+ t cells. as shown in figure 6b, the data indicate a significant reduction in the intracellular staining for ifnγ, in ilk-ko mice , confirming an attenuated th <dig> response.

foxp3+ tregs are critical regulators of the intestinal immunity  <cit> . based on the reduction in ifn-γ-producing t cells, were hypothesized that there may be a corresponding increase in tregs. indeed we found that the proportion of tregs was significantly increased in mesenteric lymph nodes . based on these ex vivo results, we next used immunohistochemistry to examine the ratio of foxp <dig> positive cells to total cd <dig> positive cells in mice affected with chronic colitis. these data confirmed that ilk-ko mice have a proportionately increased number of tregs infiltrating their intestinal mucosa . to determine the effect on th <dig> cells, which are also critical determinants of colonic inflammation, immunofluorescence was performed. as the data indicate  there is a significant reduction in the numbers of il-17a positive t cells within the ilk-ko mice.

fibronectin is capable of regulating the development of t regulatory cells
based on our findings that ilk-ko mice have reduced fibronectin and an increase in mucosal tregs, and recent evidence that treg function can be regulated by components of the extracellular matrix  <cit> , we speculated that these two observations may be linked. to test whether the levels of fibronectin may directly affect treg development, we isolated cd4+cd25- t cells and stimulated them under treg-inducing conditions  in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of fibronectin. remarkably, we found that fibronectin directly inhibits the development of foxp3+ tregs in a dose-dependent manner . these data not only reveal an inverse link between the levels of a major ecm component, fibronectin, and the differentiation of tregs, but they also provide a possible mechanistic basis for the resistance of ilk-ko mice to colitis.

discussion
this work shows for the first time that the epithelial expression of ilk, a molecule with a critical role in bidirectional cellular signaling, impacts significantly on mucosal immunity. ilk-ko mice consistently exhibited less wasting disease in response to dss-induced colitis, had reduced macroscopic and histological scores of disease, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. not only was there a reduction in the levels of colonic tissue cytokines in the ilk-ko mice, but also a consistent reduction in the numbers of ifnγ staining cells in the mln  lymphocytes. these data demonstrate that ilk normally functions to promote pro-inflammatory effects on epithelial cells, at least in part, via stimulating expression of ccl <dig> and fibronectin expression, the latter of which acts on t cells to suppress the development of tregs. knowledge that treg development is directly regulated by ecm proteins, provides a new paradigm in mucosal immunity and offers mechanistic insight into why ilk-ko mice are resistant to colitis.

we found that ilk regulates the expression of the chemokine ccl <dig>  both in vitro using an epithelial cell line and possibly in vivo in colitic mice. this is important not only because this chemokine is upregulated in human ibd, with increased ccl <dig> levels having been reported in the mucosa of ibd patients as determined by immunohistochemistry and elisa  <cit>  but also, because mice with either this chemokine genetically deleted  <cit> , or with its receptor  deleted  <cit>  are protected from developing experimental colitis. the net result of reduced ccl <dig> expression would be a reduction in the influx of monocytes and lymphocytes, leading to reduced inflammation in comparison to wild-type mice. of especial interest is the recent description of an mcp- <dig>  polymorphism that is associated with crohn's disease  <cit> , which may have implications for disease pathogenesis.

fibronectin is a large  molecular weight glycoprotein present in various tissue compartments, with defined roles in cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. it exists as a dimer with each monomer constructed of repeating type i, ii and iii protein domains. alternative splicing at extra domains a and b as well as at a connecting segment iii leads to the occurrence of over  <dig> different forms  <cit> . previously it has been shown that there is enhanced expression of fibronectin in inflamed ulcerative colitis mucosa and in fibrotic crohn's disease, but a reduced expression in inflamed crohn's disease mucosa  <cit> . interestingly, it was virtually absent in intestinal fistulae from the latter population  <cit> . it is known that ilk regulates the epithelial expression of fibronectin, which is an important component of the extracellular matrix, both by means of over-expression and also gene knockdown studies  <cit> . also, epithelial fibronectin is known to increase during both the acute and healing phases of colitis  <cit> . we have added to this by demonstrating that reduced inflammation in the ilk-ko mice is attended by a reduction in levels of fibronectin expression. because fibronectin may mediate leucocyte binding  <cit> , as these cells traverse the extracellular matrix, part of the explanation for reduced inflammation is simply that there are fewer lymphocytes present to mediate tissue damage. as many different cells are able to synthesize fibronectin we can conclude that at least a part of this is due to its reduced epithelial expression in ilk-ko mice. our observation that ilk, ccl <dig> and α <dig> integrin are induced in response to fibronectin exposure, indicates an important connection between these molecules, possibly through a positive feedback loop.

reconciling observations in chronic intestinal inflammation, where ccl <dig> is increased in both uc and cd, and changes in fibronectin expression, which appears to only undergo an increase in uc , is not straightforward. furthermore, the dss-induced colitis model utilized in this study is not one where fibrosis is generally recognized to occur. this suggests that another non-fibrosis associated, ilk-ccl2-fibronectin pathway exists in early inflammation, and that interference with any of these three components is capable of attenuating the inflammatory response. it is quite likely that alternative or additional mechanism operate to effect inflammation in crohn's disease, and consequently changes in fibronectin expression are not observed. future work will address the role of ilk on other components of the extracellular matrix that undergo changes in ibd.

whilst changes in ccl <dig> and fibronectin may offer plausible explanations for the reduction in inflammation seen in the ilk-ko mice, we were keen to investigate potential additional immune mechanisms. the reduction in the level of gamma-interferon indicates a reduction in the th <dig> response, and this observation was seen in tissue homogenates, as well as in cd <dig> cells harvested from the mesenteric lymph nodes. we next turned to t regulatory cells, which are known to have a fundamental role in regulation of mucosal immunity  <cit> . indeed, we found that protection of ilk-ko mice from colitis correlated with a relative increase in foxp3+ tregs in both the colon and in mesenteric lymph nodes. peripheral treg development in the gut can be driven by many different tolerogenic signals such as tgf-β, retinoic acid and il- <dig>  we found that under the influence of tgf-β, fibronectin directly inhibited the development of foxp3+ cells, for the first time providing a link between this and the development of immune tolerance. this finding complements recent data showing that another ecm protein, high molecular weight hyaluronan, the ligand for cd <dig>  can promote the expression of foxp <dig>  <cit> , further supporting the notion that the integrity of the tissue matrix has a direct role in directing mucosal immune responses. moreover, the direct effects of fibronectin on treg development provide a mechanism by which the loss of ilk in epithelial cells could lead to a reduced susceptibility to colitis. future research will be required to define how this novel aspect of treg development is regulated at the molecular level.

there is considerable support for the involvement of another t cell population in the pathogenesis of ibd, specifically the th <dig> cell  <cit> . in contrast to th <dig> , th <dig>  and treg  cells, this particular cell is dependent upon tgfβ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> for its differentiation  <cit> . it produces a different set of cytokines that include il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnfα, and is characterized by the expression of the transcription factor rorγt. an inverse relationship between a genetic polymorphism of its surface il- <dig> receptor  and crohn's disease has been described  <cit> . recent work indicates some degree of t cell plasticity in that t cells that express both il- <dig> and rorγt have been described  <cit> . our work indicates that the increased foxp3+ cell population in the ilk-ko mice is associated with a concomitant reduction in the il-17+ cell population, in response to induction of chronic colitis. the presence of a smaller population of dual il-17+/foxp3+ cells cannot be excluded. furthermore we do not observe any comparable change in the th <dig> cell fraction  upon plating onto fibronectin coated plates, indicating a specific effect for treg generation.

CONCLUSIONS
our work provides the first striking example of an intestinal epithelial cell molecule ilk, capable of influencing the surrounding inflammatory milieu , as well as the ecm , which in turn may impact on the mucosal inflammatory response . we therefore conclude that modulation of ilk signaling may have an impact on human ibd, and that this merits attention.
