BACKGROUND
mitochondrial uncoupling protein one  is a nuclear-encoded protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. in the presence of fatty acids, ucp <dig> uncouples the electrochemical gradient from adenosine-5′-triphosphate  synthesis, dissipating energy as heat  <cit> . mammalian ucp <dig> has long been investigated in brown adipose tissue  for its role in thermogenesis and the regulation of reactive oxygen species  production  <cit> .

ucp <dig> has also been found in plants  <cit> . similar to its mammalian orthologs, plant ucp <dig> belongs to a multigenic family whose members are expressed in a time- and tissue-dependent manner and in response to low temperature  <cit> . plant ucps have also been shown to be involved in thermogenesis regulation in skunk cabbage  <cit>  and climacteric increases in respiration in fruits  <cit> , but the widespread presence of this protein in eukaryotic organisms suggests that it may have other functions  <cit> . the overexpression of arabidopsis thaliana ucp <dig>  in tobacco plants resulted in increased tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . in addition, the tobacco plants overexpressing atucp <dig> exhibited faster germination under control and stressful conditions, improved performance under drought and salt stresses, and increased rates of photosynthesis  <cit> . the mechanism underlying this increased stress protection is generally associated with decreased ros production  <cit> , but a recent study performed on solanum lycopersicum  plants overexpressing a ucp gene suggest a wider role for ucps’ protective mechanisms by altering cell redox homeostasis and antioxidant capacity  <cit> . these previous studies regarding ucp overexpression, along with a study of an insertional knockout of atucp <dig>  <cit> , suggest that ucps may alter metabolism more globally, modulating mitochondrial, chloroplastic and cytosolic metabolism.

the role of mitochondria in energy metabolism and the stress response implies that this organelle communicates with other cellular compartments. alteration of mitochondrial function modulates the expression of ucp <dig> and other nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, including alternative oxidase  and type ii nadh dehydrogenase, through mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling  <cit> . mitochondria-to-nucleus communication has been extensively investigated in mammalian models, in which a signaling process coordinates the expression of genes encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes through mechanisms known as anterograde  and retrograde  signals  <cit> . the cytosolic concentrations of ca2+ and atp, together with the mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics and ros production, play central roles in the antero/retrograde signaling pathways and in the regulation of mitochondrial proliferation  <cit> . both anterograde and retrograde signaling have been implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> , a process that is well documented in mammalian models  <cit>  but poorly understood in plants  <cit> . in plants, the upregulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes have been seen during inflorescence development, especially during flowering  <cit> , but the molecular components involved in the regulation of this process remains elusive. recently, it has been shown that the pentatricopeptide proteins  <cit>  and the transcription factors bzip  <cit> , wrky  <cit> , tcp  <cit>  and nac  <cit>  may contribute to the retrograde regulation of mitochondrial/nucleus communication in plants.

in the present work, we investigated the mechanism of ucp <dig> action in the stress response. we used molecular, cellular and genomic tools to investigate the molecular and cellular events resulting from the overexpression of atucp <dig> in transgenic tobacco plants. we show that atucp <dig> overexpression increases uncoupled respiration, decreases cellular atp concentration, alters mitochondrial morphology, and triggers retrograde signaling, activating the expression of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. these changes are accompanied by a broad induction of stress-responsive genes that may help the atucp1-overexpressing cells reduce the levels of ros and perform better under stress conditions. the results are discussed in the context of the link between mitochondrial biogenesis and the stress response in plants.

RESULTS
overexpression of the arabidopsis ucp <dig>  in tobacco shows no phenotypic alterations independent of its transgene expression levels
the atucp <dig> gene, encoding the arabidopsis ortholog of mammalian ucp <dig>  <cit> , was cloned under the control of the 35s camv promoter and transformed into tobacco plants  <cit> . two transgenic events, p <dig> and p <dig>  which presented intermediary and high atucp <dig> expression, respectively, were chosen for this study. although ucp <dig> acts directly in the mitochondrial respiratory chain by uncoupling the electron transport from atp synthesis, no apparent phenotypic alterations were observed in the p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines compared with the wild-type  plants . this result diverges from previous findings showing increased shoot dry mass in plants overexpressing the same ucp <dig>  <cit> , but it is consistent with observations of tomato plants overexpressing a ucp, which did not exhibit growth stimulation  <cit> . the addition of sucrose to the growth medium may have altered mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis  <cit> . in the data presented in figure 1a, we did not add sucrose to the nutrient solution.

the transgenic lines p <dig> and p <dig> presented 2- to 8-fold increases in atucp <dig> expression compared to wt plants in the two leaves sampled . immunoblotting using an anti-atucp <dig> polyclonal antibody, which recognizes the tobacco and arabidopsis ucp <dig>  showed that the atucp <dig> protein  was weakly detectable in wt leaves but accumulated at high levels in p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines .

atucp <dig> overexpression triggers mitochondria biogenesis through retrograde signaling
young and mature leaves differ in their responses to cold stress and photosynthetic activity  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether young or more expanded leaves would respond differently to atucp <dig> overexpression. p <dig>  p <dig> and wt plants were grown for 12 weeks, and apical leaves varying from youngest  to oldest   were sampled. mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from l <dig>  stained with the mitochondria-selective probe mitotracker red cm-h2xros  and analyzed with fluorescent confocal microscopy. both p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines showed  <dig> - to 2-fold increases in the mitotracker red fluorescence signal compared with wt, indicating that ucp <dig> overexpression led to an increase in the mitochondrial number and/or volume . the arabidopsis mitochondrial dna  encodes  <dig> proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism and mtdna maintenance  <cit> . in mammals, mtdna replication is strongly associated with cellular demand for atp  <cit> . to investigate whether the increased mitotracker red fluorescence signal observed in the p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines is associated with alteration in mtdna, we used the matr maturase gene to quantify its mtdna content relative to the wt line. qrt-pcr quantification of matr in total dna extracted from l <dig> to l <dig> leaves revealed an estimated mtdna increase of 2- to 5-fold in the p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines, respectively, compared with that of wt plants . because mitochondrial biogenesis requires the coordinated expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , we examined whether atucp <dig> overexpression results in the upregulation of other nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial proteins. q-pcr of total rna extracted from l <dig> to l <dig> leaves from p <dig>  p <dig> and wt plants was used to quantify relative mrna content from genes encoding a selected set of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial proteins. independent of leaf age, the p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines presented 2- to 5-fold increases in the transcript abundance of nadh dehydrogenase  and nadh iron-sulfur proteins  <dig> and  <dig> , which are components of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i  <cit>  . the increases in both nuclear-encoded  and mitochondrial-encoded  components of complex i indicate that mitochondrial/nuclear coordination is necessary for bioenergetic adaptation. mincreased transcript abundance in p <dig> and p <dig> transgenic lines was also observed for the molecular chaperone grpe and for the adenine nucleotide exchange factor of heat shock protein- <dig>  that is involved in mitochondrial targeting of proteins  <cit>  . we also observed that the p <dig> transgenic line showed 2- to 5-fold increases in the protein levels of cytochrome oxidase subunit ii , isocitrate dehydrogenase , voltage-dependent anion channel- <dig> , and alternative oxidase , which are proteins associated with both oxidative stress  <cit>  and mitochondrial metabolism  <cit>  . these data indicate that atucp <dig> overexpression triggered retrograde signaling, leading to increased transcription and translation of mitochondrial proteins encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, culminating in increased mitochondrial biogenesis.

atucp <dig> overexpression increases uncoupling respiratory capacity and decreases cellular atp content
although atucp <dig> overexpression protects tobacco plants from oxidative, osmotic and drought stress, no previous data indicate whether ucp <dig> does, in fact, uncouple atp synthesis in these plants  <cit> . however, previous work has demonstrated that mitochondria isolated from solanum tuberosum  plants overexpressing a ucp show increased uncoupled respiration  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that crude mitochondria isolated from l <dig> leaves of wt and p <dig> plants retained their respiratory properties: adp and fccp can efficiently increase oxygen consumption when compared to basal respiration . additionally, transgenic plants showed decreased adenosine 5′-diphosphate -dependent respiration and increased uncoupling respiration in comparison to wt plants . there was no significant difference in the oxygen consumption in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone  between p <dig> and wt mitochondria . the increased uncoupling respiration of p <dig> compared with wt mitochondria is evident in a comparison of the leak ratios  in p <dig> and wt . the increased uncoupling respiration in the p <dig> transgenic line resulted in 20–35% decreased cellular atp concentration in the l <dig> leaves compared with the wt .

altered mitochondrial metabolism due to increased ucp <dig> activity leads to changes in mitochondrial number, volume and morphology
mitochondrial fission and fusion dynamics, as well as mitochondrial morphology, have been shown to be directly affected by modulations in the energy demand and nutrient supply in human cells  <cit> . the fine regulation of these parameters is linked to the adaptation of mitochondrial architecture to metabolic demand. to address whether atucp <dig> overexpression affects mitochondrial morphology, we performed transmission electron microscopy  of mesophyll cells of l <dig> leaves from p <dig> and wt plants. approximately  <dig> micrograph fields for each genotype were analyzed for mitochondrial number and area using imagej  <cit> . images from p <dig> leaves revealed increases of  <dig> -fold in mitochondrial number and  <dig> -fold in mitochondrial volume, resulting in an overall augmentation of  <dig> -fold in the total mitochondrial area . surprisingly, and perhaps for the first time, we observed a novel mitochondrial morphology in plant cells: donut-shaped mitochondria . this morphology has been observed in human cells during treatment with fccp or subjection to hypoxic stress  <cit> . these treatments decrease oxygen availability for atp production. this unusual morphology has also been observed during reoxygenation and fccp washout, when cells reoxygenate and atp levels are partially restored. when atp levels were completely restored, the donut-shaped mitochondria fragmented, generating new mitochondria. these findings suggest that atucp <dig> overexpression triggers a retrograde signal that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. the alterations in both mitochondrial architecture and morphology may be due to metabolic stress imposed by the higher activity of the electron transport chain, thus increasing oxygen consumption, together with the reduced atp synthesis caused by the atucp <dig> overexpression. the donut-shaped mitochondrial morphology might be associated with the fusion/fission dynamics but may also be important to alleviate the tension imposed by the increased mitochondrial volume  <cit> .

atucp <dig> overexpression induces broad transcriptomic activation of mitochondrial and stress-responsive genes
it was unexpected that the overexpression of a single protein would result in mitochondrial biogenesis because the mitochondrial proteome is composed of over  <dig> proteins  <cit> . therefore, the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis would require the expression of an array of genes encoding these proteins. to examine the extent of retrograde signaling activation due to atucp <dig> overexpression, we conducted a global transcriptomic analysis of l <dig> leaves from p <dig> and wt plants. the transcripts were annotated using uniprot  <cit>  and categorized into the clustering of orthologous groups  database  <cit> . we used tair subcellular prediction of proteins  <cit>  to identify a total of  <dig> nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts that have significantly higher rpkm values in the p <dig> transgenic line and  <dig> that have higher expression levels in wt plants . in addition, we identified  <dig> mitochondrial-encoded proteins, all of which were more than 2-fold  upregulated in the p <dig> transgenic line . the most representative mitochondrial upregulated proteins include those associated with energy production, pentatricopeptide proteins, proteins associated with mitochondrial transcription and translation, and a large number of unknown proteins . proteins with unknown subcellular prediction were submitted to further analysis using targetp  <cit> . this analysis allowed us to identify another  <dig> proteins predicted to be targeted to mitochondria with fold-changes higher than  <dig>  in p <dig> plants . among several proteins with unknown function, we identified possible orthologs of one of the mitochondrial calcium uniporters  and a mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger . one of these proteins , which is  <dig> -fold upregulated in p <dig>  contains a coiled-coil domain on the c-terminal region, which is found among the mcus, and has a strong sequence similarity with the arabidopsis thaliana , mus musculus  and homo sapiens  mitochondrial calcium uniporters. the other protein  contains a sodium/calcium-exchanging domain whose sequence is predicted to be targeted to mitochondria. among the upregulated proteins in the p <dig> transgenic line, we also identified several proteins associated with calcium signaling, mitochondrial import machinery and mitochondrial fission and fusion processes, along with transcripts related to lipid metabolism, which may act to support ucp <dig> activity and cell metabolism . several transcription factors that may play a role in mitochondrial retrograde signaling were also identified . surprisingly, we also identified  <dig> genes responsive to abiotic stress, 72%  of which have increased expression in the p <dig> transgenic line compared with wt . among these stress-associated proteins, we identified large numbers associated with heat, osmotic, cold, drought, salt, oxidative and cadmium stress . we also observed  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increases in the transcript levels of genes involved in antioxidant mechanisms, including sod, gpx and gsts, among the upregulated stress-responsive genes .

ucp <dig> transgenic line performed better under abiotic stresses
in addition to the previous observation of increased tolerance to oxidative, salt, and drought stresses  <cit> , we observed that the p <dig> ucp <dig> overexpressor performed better under low and high ph, hyperosmotic stress, and oxidative stress . additionally, in the presence of free fatty acids, the p <dig> transgenic line also exhibited improved performance under low temperature, a result that support the thermogenic role of plant ucp <dig> . because ucp <dig> activity in mouse brown adipose tissue, potato tuber and tobacco leaves can reduce superoxide accumulation  <cit> , we examined whether this process also occurs in the p <dig> transgenic line but used an approach that detects ros accumulation only within mitochondria. when subjected to salt, oxidative and hyperosmotic stress, mitochondrial ros accumulation was decreased in the p <dig> transgenic line compared with wt plants in both leaf discs and roots .

discussion
the mitochondrial respiratory chain is composed of four macromolecular complexes through which free energy is conserved by coupling electron transport to the formation of a proton motive force by complexes i, iii, and iv, which is then dissipated by f1fo-atpase  for atp synthesis  <cit> . in the bat, electron transport is uncoupled from atp synthesis by ucp <dig> for heat production  <cit> . however, bat is a specialized tissue dedicated to thermogenesis regulation whose main characteristic is a dramatic increase in mitochondria number and ucp <dig> expression  <cit> . in other cell types, however, decreased atp concentration may compromise cell metabolism  <cit> ; therefore, cells somehow sense the cytoplasmic atp concentration as a signal to change gene expression to quickly readjust the mitochondrial architecture and cell metabolism  <cit> . in this work, we show that the overexpression of ucp <dig> increases uncoupled respiration and decreases cellular atp concentration. there is evidence demonstrating that mitochondria isolated from potato plants overexpressing ucp exhibit increased uncoupling respiration  <cit> , but the present study represents the first time that the effect of ucp on intracellular atp level has been quantified in plants. it is possible that the enhanced uncoupled respiration and its consequent negative effect on the atp production trigger a signal to compensate for the energy metabolism and maintain atp at safe levels. consistent with this view is the remarkable upregulation of electron transport chain components, including nadh-deh, nadh-is2- <dig>  and cox, observed in the p <dig> overexpressor. the coordinated upregulation of the electron transport chain components encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes occurs in tissues with high metabolic demands and increased mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> , such as flowers  <cit>  and germinating seeds  <cit> .

mitochondrial biogenesis was observed using multiple approaches, including mitotracker red fluorescence imaging, quantitation of mtdna and tem. in all cases, these methods allowed us to conclude that the overexpression of atucp <dig> resulted in increased mitochondrial number and volume. to assess whether the upregulation of mitochondrial genes was restricted to the electron transport chain components, we performed global transcriptome sequencing and observed the upregulation of hundreds of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. all of the identified transcripts encoded on the mtdna were upregulated in transgenic plants, which is consistent with the increased mtdna content. for instance, the atp synthase gene encoded by the mtdna was found to be upregulated by  <dig> -fold, and two of its nuclear subunits were increased by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold. this upregulation was not restricted to the components involved in the oxidative phosphorylation but also included genes that participate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle . the key control point of the tca is the enzyme idh  <cit> , which showed increased protein levels in p <dig> plants . in fact, experiments performed with mitochondria isolated from potato plants demonstrated that ucp <dig> activity facilitates higher tca flux by decreasing membrane potential and, consequently, ros production  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation is the main regulatory factor in the expression of nuclear-encoded genes associated with respiration  <cit> , but the vast majority of proteins targeted to the mitochondria are transported post-translationally by tightly regulated machinery  <cit> . among these proteins, hsp <dig> is involved in the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer membrane, whereas the mitochondrial tom and tim translocases are responsible for transport inside the organelle  <cit> . interestingly, all of these proteins were upregulated in the p <dig> atucp <dig> overexpression line. the increased expression of components of the mitochondrial energy production machinery, along with the increased mitochondrial number of transgenic cells, may alter cellular energy homeostasis. therefore, the mitochondria may consume more substrates in an attempt to boost atp synthesis; for that purpose, these substrates must be supplied from other sources. this need might explain the increased photosynthetic rate exhibited by these plants under control conditions  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing provides an important tool to investigate this possibility. we did not observe differential expression patterns between wt and p <dig> plants regarding chloroplast-targeted proteins , but further analysis of the transcriptome might provide new insights into this issue.

the adaptation to changes in energy supply and demand influences not only mitochondrial gene expression but also mitochondrial architecture and morphology  <cit> . alterations in mitochondrial morphology during starvation have already been observed in arabidopsis thaliana cells cultured without a carbon source  <cit> . in human cells, treatment with the chemical uncoupler fccp causes an increase in oxygen consumption and a decrease in atp generation, provoking mitochondrial fragmentation and the appearance of donut-shaped mitochondria  <cit> . this fragmentation may occur to support an increase in respiration in an attempt to elevate atp levels  <cit> , whereas the formation of the donut-shaped morphology may be a component of a protective mechanism that helps to preserve the organelles from damage under conditions of metabolic stress  <cit> . when fccp is washed out of these cells, the donut morphology persists until the atp levels are completely restored, at which point the donuts fragment and new mitochondria arise. the mechanisms underlying the donut formation in ucp1-overexpressing cells might be explained by an analogy with human cells. increased ucp <dig> activity decreases the membrane potential that is used for atp synthesis, provoking an increase in mitochondrial number to balance the atp levels in transgenic plants. mitochondria are responsible for at least 90% of cell oxygen consumption  <cit> . we therefore expect that an increase in respiratory chain machinery and mitochondrial number, together with the constant leak caused by ucp <dig>  would result in increased oxygen consumption per molecule of atp generated. thus, this metabolic stress caused by ucp <dig> overexpression appears sufficient to allow the formation of donut mitochondria in plant cells.

communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is required for the adaptations that we observed in p <dig> transgenic plants. although several important regulators of chloroplastic retrograde signaling have been extensively studied  <cit> , relatively little is known about the regulators of mitochondrial retrograde signaling in plants. several recently published studies suggest roles for the wrky, bzip, tcp, and nac transcription factor families in activating the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins in plants  <cit> . these transcription factors recognize elements that are overrepresented in the regulatory region of mitochondrial genes and that are involved in several biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the colocalization of proteins in mitochondria and the nucleus appears to be an important topic that is very little explored in plants. for example, an arabidopsis thaliana pentatricopeptide protein   <cit>  was identified in both mitochondria and nucleus that may act to coordinate the expression between the two genomes. the increased expression of transcription factors that belong to the wrky and tcp families, along with the upregulation of a large number of pentatricopeptide proteins in transgenic plants, presents the opportunity to further explore new candidates involved in mitochondrial retrograde signaling. the expression of most transcriptional regulators is further linked to cellular signals and environmental cues  <cit> . the most studied cellular signals involved in mitochondria-nucleus signaling are atp, calcium and ros  <cit> . although the role of mitochondria in calcium metabolism has been extensively studied in mammals, little is known about calcium signaling by plant mitochondria  <cit> . mitochondria in mammals are able to sequester cytoplasmic ca+ <dig>  functioning as a transient calcium store for protective mechanisms  <cit> . additionally, the ca+ <dig> levels inside the organelle are positively correlated with increased atp production  <cit> , although ca+ <dig> overaccumulation is linked to the induction of apoptosis in both mammals and plants  <cit> . consistent with this relation, it is very interesting that we found two genes upregulated in transgenic plants that are possible orthologs, an mcu and an mcx, along with several genes involved in calcium signaling . the mcus and mcxs have been extensively studied in animal cells, and their expression is tightly linked with mitochondrial calcium transport  <cit> .

the main focus of previous studies regarding ucp <dig> overexpression in plants has been ros production  <cit> . both potato and tobacco transgenic plants presented decreased superoxide production under abiotic stresses  <cit> . additionally, tomato plants overexpressing ucp <dig> demonstrate not only an alteration on ros production but also a possible role of ucp <dig> in regulating the cellular redox homeostasis  <cit> . the plants analyzed in the present study showed increased expression not only of the antioxidant defense system, including gpx, gsts and sod, but also of an array of stress-responsive genes. this effect may help explain the positive impact of atucp <dig> overexpression on the tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. consistent with previous data, we show in this work that atucp <dig> overexpression protects plants from a number of abiotic stresses, including high ph, low ph and cold. the fact that transgenic tobacco performs better at low temperatures when the medium is supplemented with fatty acids reinforces the thermogenic role of ucp <dig> in plants. the importance of ros in cell signaling is well known  <cit> ; thus, the results regarding decreased mitochondrial ros production under oxidative, osmotic and salt stresses also reinforce the importance of this molecule in ucp1-mediated retrograde signaling.

together, these data indicate that atucp1-overexpressing lines suffer metabolic stress caused by the increased uncoupling respiration. chronic overexpression of ucp <dig> can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals  <cit> . therefore, we propose that in the transgenic plants, the lower atp level acts as a key element in the retrograde signaling, promoting a broad increase in the expression of both mitochondrial genes and stress-related genes. this pattern is reflected in the decreased ros production and the better performance of these plants under various stresses. these findings advance our understanding of stress-tolerance mechanisms, mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic adaptation in plants and therefore might assist in the implementation of biotechnological tools for the development of abiotic stress-tolerant plants. the overall regulation of stress-responsive genes indicates a link between ucp1-activated mitochondrial biogenesis and the increased stress response exhibited by the transgenic plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we present strong evidence that the overexpression of ucp <dig> protein affects the mitochondrial dynamics at both structural and metabolic levels, leading to an increased mitochondria number and volume per cell. it could be argued that these changes are a consequence of the overpopulation of ucp <dig> protein at the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby leading to abnormal mitochondrial structure and function. we interpret the results presented in this manuscript as a beneficial effect of the overexpression of ucp <dig> that triggers a retrograde signaling process, signaling the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to increase the production of mitochondrial proteins. consequently, more mitochondrial membrane is produced. the increase in ucp <dig>  both because of the overproduction of the protein and the increased mitochondrial number and volume, leads to increased uncoupled respiration, decreasing the cellular atp concentration. this change may trigger metabolic stress and enhances a strong stress response. because it does not affect plant growth and development, this mechanism might be used to create crops better adapted to abiotic stress conditions.
