BACKGROUND
since the inception of antibody technology twenty years ago, phage display is a powerful tool to generate antibodies for proteome research  <cit> , diagnostics  <cit>  or for therapeutic purposes  <cit> . therapeutic antibodies are currently one of the fastest developing class of biologicals in the pharmaceutical market  <cit> . the main indications for therapeutic antibodies are cancer and auto-immune diseases  <cit> . to date,  <dig> antibodies and antibody conjugates are ema and/or fda approved   and about  <dig> antibodies and antibody fusion proteins were under development in  <dig>  <cit> . two major strategies for generating fully human antibodies are: transgenic mice and antibody phage display. in transgenic mice, the chromosome segments encoding antibody gene fragments are replaced with the corresponding human chromosome segments encoding human immunoglobulins. these animals allow the generation of fully human antibodies by hybridoma technology  <cit> . an advantage of transgenic mice is the in vivo affinity maturation of antibodies, but on the other hand, all in vivo antibody generations are restricted by the natural immune system itself: the limitation in antigen processing and presentation and the tolerance against conserved epitopes  <cit> . antibody phage display is an alternative or complementing technology to generate human antibody fragments from universal antibody gene libraries as lead candidates for therapeutic development  <cit> . here, the selection is an in vitro process and is not limited by the restrictions of the immune system and selection conditions can be adjusted and controlled, thus allowing to select for properties not achievable by in vivo immune systems  <cit> . to isolate human antibodies by phage display, two types of antibody gene libraries are used: immune libraries and universal or “single-pot” libraries  <cit> . immune libraries from patients are suited to select specific antibodies against a disease or pathogen, e.g. cancer  <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus  <cit> or herpes simplex virus  <cit> . “single-pot” libraries allow the selection of antibodies - in theory - against any target. the human naive antibody gene libraries hal4/7/ <dig> are “single-pot” libraries. antibodies against a panel of different antigens were selected from these hal libraries and applied for different purposes, e.g.  <cit> . antibody fragments from these libraries can directly be cloned into a selection of compatible expression vectors to produce e.g. in vivo biotinylated antibodies  <cit> , scfv-fc  <cit>  or full igg . the scfv-fc format  is an alternative, functionally identical to igg in most assays. due to its quicker and easier production, it provides a robust format for screening of large numbers of antibody candidates, and can be converted to full igg afterwards.

in this work, the scfv phagemid vector design was optimized and the “single-pot” antibody gene libraries hal9/ <dig> were constructed and analyzed, demonstrating significant improvements over previous designs.

methods
construction of phage display vectors
the phage display vector phal <dig> was constructed by cloning a dna fragment encoding his-/c-myc tag flanked by noti and bamhi, which was generated with two pcr primers  into phal <dig>  scfv coding sequences from phal <dig> were cloned in phal <dig> using the restriction sites ncoi and noti. the c-terminal phenylalanine of the vК was deleted from scfv coding sequences by pcr using the primer set mkpelb_f  and mhkappaclscfv-noti_r <dig> . the pcr products were cloned into the vector phal <dig>  <cit>  and phal <dig> between the vector encoded signal peptide and the c-myc/ his-tag or his/ c-myc-tag sequences, respectively, using the restriction sites ncoi and noti.

for vl cloning 5 μg vector phal <dig> and 2 μg kappa or lambda pcr products were digested in a volume of 100 μl using  <dig> u mlui and noti  at 37°c for 3 h. this step was performed multiple times to produce enough material for up to  <dig> transformations. for quality control each digestion was performed separately with each enzyme in parallel. the digestions were inactivated at 80°c for 20 min, followed by adding  <dig>  u calf intestine phosphatase   and incubation at 37°c for 30 min, this step was repeated once. vector and pcr products were purified using the nucleospin gel and pcr clean-up kit, removing short stuffer fragments between mlui and noti in phal <dig>  each ligation was performed with 1 μg digested vector and 270 ng pcr product using  <dig> u t <dig> ligase  in a volume of 100 μl overnight at 16°c. ligations were inactivated at 70°c for 10 min and precipitated with 10 μl 3 m sodium acetate ph  <dig>  and 250 μl ethanol for 2 min at rt, followed by 5 min centrifugation at 16000 × g and 4°c. pellet was washed two times with 500 μl 70%  ethanol. the dried pellet was resuspended in 35 μl dh2o and mixed on ice with 25 μl electrocompetent e. coli xl1-blue mrf’. electroporation was performed with  <dig>  cm prechilled cuvettes using a micropulser electroporator  at  <dig>  kv. immediately, 1 ml prewarmed 37°c soc medium ph  <dig>   tryptone,  <dig> %  yeast extract,  <dig> %  nacl, 20 mm mg solution, 20 mm glucose) was added and incubated for 1 h at 600 rpm and 37°c. transformation was plated out on 25 cm square petri dishes with 2xyt-gat agar  tryptone, 1%  yeast extract,  <dig> %  nacl, 100 mm glucose, 100 μg/ml ampiciline, 20 μg/ml tetracycline,  <dig> %  agar-agar) and incubated overnight at 37°c. in parallel 10− <dig> dilutions of each transformation reaction were plated out to determine the transformation rate. these plates were used also for quality control by colony pcr using the oligonucleotide primers mhlacz-pro_f and mhgiii_r to verify the insert size. the colonies were scraped from the 25 cm plates using 40 ml 2xyt medium  tryptone, 1%  yeast extract,  <dig> %  nacl) and 5 ml were directly used for midi plasmid preparation using the nucleobond plasmid midi kit .

for vh cloning material from  <dig> donors of the previous described hal7/ <dig> libraries  <cit>  was used in addition to material of  <dig> new donors. in a first step 5 μg phal30-vl sublibraries and 2 μg vh pcr products were digested in a volume of 100 μl using  <dig> u ncoi-hf and  <dig> u hindiii-hf  at 37°c for 3 h. this step was performed several times to produce enough material for 150– <dig> transformations. the digestions, ligations and transformations were performed as described for vl cloning with following modifications. ligation was performed with 250 ng vh pcr product. after transformation of xl1-blue mrf’, overnight incubation on 25 cm 2 × yt-gat plates and resuspension in 25 ml 2 × yt medium, glycerol stocks of each library were made using 800 μl bacteria solution  and 200 μl glycerol  and stored at −80°c. for the final library one glycerol stock of each sublibrary was thawed, mixed together, aliquoted  and stored at −80°c.

the antibody gene libraries hal9/ <dig> were packaged separately inoculating 400 ml 2 × yt-ga  with a library glycerol stock. the bacteria were grown to an optical density at 600 nm  of  <dig> – <dig>  at 37°c and 250 rpm. 25 ml bacterial culture  were infected with  <dig>  ×  <dig> hyperphage particles  <cit> , incubated at 37°c for 30 min without shaking followed by 30 min at 250 rpm. infected cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3220xg. the pellet was resuspended in 400 ml 2 × yt-ak . phage were produced at 30°c and 250 rpm over night. the bacteria were centrifuged for 20 min at  <dig>  × g. phage particles in the supernatant were precipitated with 1/ <dig> volume of 20%  polyethylene glycol / <dig>  m nacl solution for one hour on ice with gentle shaking and pelleted by centrifugation for one hour at  <dig>  × g at 4°c. the precipitated phage were resuspended in 10 ml phage dilution buffer , 1/ <dig> volume of peg solution was added and incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at  <dig>  × g and 4°c. the pellet was resupended in 1 ml phage dilution buffer. residual bacteria and cell debris were removed by additional centrifugation for 5 min at 16000 × g at 20°c. supernatants containing antibody phage were stored at 4°c. phage titration was done as described before  <cit> . the scfv display rates of the packaged libraries were analyzed by 10% sds-page, western blot and anti-piii immunostain . wildtype piii has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, but it runs at an apparent molecular mass of 65 kda in sds-page  <cit> . accordingly, the scfv::piii fusion protein runs at about 95 kda.

antibody selection 
antibody selections were performed against proteins or peptides as described before  <cit> . the elution with trypsin - phal <dig> and the former vector phal <dig> contain a trypsin site between the tags and giii - is more efficient as elution by ph shift .

RESULTS
analysis of the new phage display vector phal30
a prerequisite for a good up to date antibody gene library is a phagemid that allows both, a high display level of functional antibody fragments on phage and a good expression of soluble antibodies for screening. the new design of the phagemid generation phal <dig>  is based on the phal <dig>  <cit> . in the first optimization step and independent of kappa or lambda light chains, the tag order in the phal <dig> phagemid was changed from the initial his/myc-tag in phal <dig> to myc/his tag. for evaluation of the expression capacity of both phagemids, three different soluble scfv antibody fragments were produced in 150 ml e.coli xl- <dig> blue mrf’ culture for 4 h at 25°c and 250 rpm. functional soluble scfv antibody fragments were quantified by antigen elisa in the production supernatant, the periplasmatic extract, the osmotic shock fraction and the eluate after imac purification . except for the osmotic shock preparation, the production level with the phal <dig> phagemid was always significantly improved. after imac purification of the supernatants, the yields of ht186-d <dig> were 1 mg/l for phal <dig> and 2 mg/l for phal <dig>  in case of tm43-e <dig> the yields were 1 mg/l for both vectors and for d <dig>  the yields increased from  <dig>  mg/l for phal <dig> to 1 mg/l for phal <dig>  the production yields in the periplasmic fraction of scfvs ht186-d <dig> and tm43-e <dig> after imac purification were improved from  <dig>  mg/l, and  <dig>  mg/l with phal <dig> to  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  mg/l, respectively, with phal <dig> figure  <dig>

next, four different phal <dig> and phal <dig> phagemids were packaged with hyperphage. the resulting phage titers were comparable among each other. they ranged from 6 ×  <dig> to 6 ×  <dig> cfu/ ml culture medium. the scfv display level on phage was identical, as confirmed by western immunoblot . approximately 90% of g3p was fused to the scfv antibody fragments.

a functional comparison of phal <dig> and phal <dig> scfv-phage regarding antigen binding was performed by titration antigen elisa . the titration curves were similar for three different scfv-phage, further illustrating similar display level. for tm43-e <dig> more functional scfv were displayed on phage. taken together, both phagemids are almost identical in phage display level and phage binding assays, but the phal <dig> phagemid provided a significant increase in production of soluble antibody fragments for screening which may improve the hit rate in initial screening assays.

influence of the phenylalanine residue in kappa cl on scfv phage display
target independent, it was observed that scfv antibody fragments bearing a vК light chain were less frequently isolated from hal7/ <dig> than those with a vλ light chain  <cit> . a possible explanation could be a lower expression of antibody fragments with a vК light chain. therefore, the phagemid was further optimized by deleting the bulky c-terminal phenylalanine of the vК light chain. first, the soluble production level of five known scfv fragments in phal <dig> and six known kappa scfv fragments in phal <dig> was analyzed and compared by western immunoblot . the deletion of the phenylalanine in the vК light chain resulted in a higher production level for all tested scfv. further expression analysis by western immunblot included the comparison of  <dig> randomly chosen scfv fragments from the kappa hal <dig> antibody gene library and their phenylalanine deletion version . the expression levels were higher with the phenylalanine deletion mutants in  <dig> cases, slightly lower for three clones and in the same range for the remaining  <dig> clones.

construction of hal <dig> and hal10
using blood samples obtained from  <dig> caucasian, african, indian and chinese non-immunized human donors, the new antibody libraries hal <dig> and hal <dig> were constructed using the improved phagemid backbone phal <dig>  in detail, blood lymphocytes from  <dig> caucasian, african, indian and chinese non-immunized human donors were isolated for library construction. lymphocyte mrna was reverse transcribed to cdna and the antibody gene repertoire was amplified in two steps. in the first step, vh and the full length light chains were amplified using a set of framework  <dig> forward primers and igm, kappa and lambda constant domain reverse primers  <cit> . in the second step, specific restriction sites were incorporated for cloning into the phal <dig> phagemid vector. for the second amplification step of vh and lambda subfamilies the dna antibody repertoire  from  <dig> donors of the previously constructed hal <dig> was added for construction of the new hal <dig> and hal <dig> libraries. both libraries contain the same vh repertoire  but differ in their light chain repertoire. hal <dig> includes all lambda subfamilies , hal <dig> all kappa subfamilies  except the pseudogene encoding vκ <dig>  cloning of the antibody genes was done in two steps. first, light chain genes were cloned with 1 ×  <dig> independent clones for each library. then heavy chain genes were cloned in the light chain containing phagemid leading to a final repertoire size of the hal <dig> and hal <dig> scfv libraries of  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively.

analysis of v-gene subfamily distribution
to assess the diversity of the libraries, bacterial colonies from library transformation plates were analyzed by colony pcr and sequencing. in total  <dig> full length scfv encoding sequences for hal <dig> and  <dig> sequences for hal <dig> were aligned to human germline v gene segments using vbase <dig>  <cit> . to compare the initial diversity of the libraries with the germline usage after selection,  <dig> antibodies selected against  <dig> targets were analyzed. of these selected antibodies from libraries hal <dig> and hal <dig>   <dig> % were bearing a vκ light chain compared to 4% of antibodies selected from hal7/ <dig>  the antibody subfamily distribution of the unselected hal7/ <dig> libraries , the subfamily frequency of selected scfvs from hal7/ <dig>  and the in vivo distribution  <cit>  are shown in figure 3a-c. the heavy chain diversity of the unselected hal9/ <dig> libraries is similar to the subfamily distribution found in vivo . vh <dig> and vh <dig> are the dominating vh subfamilies in the initial library as well as for the selected scfvs. vh <dig> shows a slight underrepresentation in the initial library, whereas the vh <dig> subfamily is overrepresented in all unselected and selected hal libraries. vκ <dig> and vκ <dig> are the most abundant subfamilies, which is consistent with findings in vivo . vκ <dig> is overrepresented in the unselected hal <dig> library but could not be retrieved after selection and in contrast vκ <dig> was significantly enriched during selection. in the vλ repertoire of hal <dig>  the vλ1- <dig> are the most abundant subfamilies similar to the subfamily distribution found in vivo , but the frequency of vλ1- <dig> is lower compared to the in vivo frequency due to an overrepresentation of subfamilies vλ4/6/7/8/ <dig> which are found only in low frequency in vivo.figure  <dig>

sequence analysis indicated a high antibody germline gene diversity for the heavy-chain and light-chain repertoires of the hal9/ <dig> libraries. the identified heavy chain repertoire in this limited sample already covered  <dig> of  <dig> functional vh genes . in addition, one vh gene  occurred in the unselected libraries that has not yet been confirmed to be functional  <cit> . vh germline genes were observed in frequencies between  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the unselected hal <dig> and hal <dig> with no significant differences between the libraries. the comparison of the gene usage before and after selection shows a clear enrichment of some vh genes. the most abundant vh genes after selection were ighv3- <dig>  increased from  <dig> % in the unselected libraries to  <dig> % after selection, ighv1- <dig>  increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and ighv1- <dig>  increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % after selection. the frequency of the remaining vh germline genes remained constant or was lowered after selection. most strikingly, the usage of all vh <dig> genes was considerably reduced in selected antibodies. only  <dig> of  <dig> vh <dig> germline genes were found again after selection with a ten-fold reduction in total frequency, decreasing from  <dig> % in the unselected libraries to  <dig> % after selection .figure  <dig>

 <dig> of the  <dig> functional vλ genes were found in the hal <dig> library sample . one vλ gene  was found in the unselected hal <dig> as well in selected scfvs that is predicted to be not functional  <cit> . as seen for the heavy chain repertoire, the frequency of several vλ germline genes changed during the selection process. usage of the vλ <dig> subfamily was increased after selection mostly due to a higher abundance of the iglv1- <dig> germline gene, increasing from  <dig> % in the unselected library to  <dig> % after selection and a higher abundance of iglv1- <dig>  increasing from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . in the vλ <dig> subfamily, the frequency of the iglv2- <dig> germline gene showed a slight increase from  <dig> % to  <dig> % after selection but the overall abundance of vλ <dig> genes decreased due to a lower usage of the remaining germline genes. three of nine different vλ <dig> germline genes were retrieved in high frequency before and after selection: iglv3- <dig>  iglv3- <dig> and iglv2- <dig>  the findings reflect the in vivo subfamily distribution, where iglv3- <dig> and iglv2- <dig> account for ~80% of vλ <dig>  <cit> . after selection the frequency of iglv3- <dig> was reduced from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and increased for iglv3- <dig> from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. usage of iglv3- <dig> remained constant. the abundance of the most prevalent vλ gene iglv6- <dig> in the unselected hal <dig> was decreased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % after selection.

in the hal <dig> library  <dig> of  <dig> functional vκ germline genes were observed . two vκ genes  found in the unselected library were described to be only potentially functional  <cit> . the most abundant vκ germline gene before selection was igkv4- <dig> with a frequency of ~25%. this is a more than twofold higher prevalence than found in vivo  <cit>  and usage of igkv4- <dig> after selection was reduced to ~4%. the frequency of vκ <dig> subfamily genes was raised from 37% in the unselected library to 48% after selection . three genes igkv1- <dig>  igkv1-d <dig> and igkv1-d <dig> increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> %,  <dig>  to  <dig> % and from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, respectively.

the abundance of heavy- and light-chain pairings that were observed in the unselected libraries and within selected antibodies are illustrated in figure  <dig> for vh-vλ combinations and in figure  <dig> for vh-vκ combinations. in the unselected libraries no particular vh-vl combination is dominating . the pairings are evenly distributed depending on their total abundance. vh-vλ pairings were observed in frequencies between  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the unselected hal <dig> with vh3-30/vλ6- <dig> being the most abundant combination. in the unselected hal <dig> pairing frequencies up to  <dig> % were observed for vh-vκ due to the high abundance of the igkv4- <dig> germline gene. however, after  <dig> individual selections a clear preference for particular vh-vl pairings was detected. for vh-vλ pairings the most prevalent combination was vh3-30/vλ3- <dig> which was observed in  <dig> % of the selected antibodies. the λ3- <dig> gene showed a preference for pairing with vh <dig> germline genes. the vh3- <dig> germline gene was by far the most abundant vh gene after selection and paired with nearly all light chain genes in high frequency. interestingly, the light chain gene vλ8- <dig> paired almost exclusively with vh3- <dig>  the remaining vλ germline genes showed preferential pairing with the vh <dig> and vh <dig> germline genes and with lower frequency also to the vh6- <dig> germline gene. a second vh <dig> subfamily gene, vh3- <dig>  was also observed in high frequency after selection. similar to vh3- <dig> no clear preference in pairing with any vλ genes segment was seen. for three vh <dig> genes a more distinct preference for single vλ genes was observed. the combinations vh1-46/vλ1- <dig> and vh1-69/vλ1- <dig> were enriched to  <dig> % and the combination vh1-18/vλ1- <dig> was enriched to  <dig> %. the five most common vh-vλ combinations  account for nearly 20% of all selected antibodies.

an enrichment of the vh3- <dig> germline gene after selection was also observed for the vh-vκ gene pairing. furthermore a high frequency of vκ <dig> and vκ <dig> genes occurred after selection, but due to the relatively small sample size of selected antibodies bearing a kappa light chain no significant conclusion can be made about enrichment of single vh-vκ combinations.

cdr <dig> length and amino acid distribution of light-chain and heavy-chain
length and amino acid distribution of cdr3-l and cdr3-h of the hal <dig> and hal <dig> libraries were analyzed. for example,  <dig> cdr3-h sequences of the unselected libraries and  <dig> sequences of selected antibodies were analyzed and compared. the cdr3-h length distribution before and after selection is depicted in figure 6a. in the unselected libraries, the cdr3-h length ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> aa with a median length of about  <dig> aa. cdr3-h longer than  <dig> aa are occurring only in low frequency. after selection, the distribution is very slightly shifted towards a cdr3-h length with a median of  <dig> aa. cdr <dig> length of  <dig> –  <dig> aa are found in high frequency after selection but cdr3-h length longer than  <dig> aa were not detected. long cdr-h <dig> sequences are often internally stabilized by disulfide bridges in a very characteristic manner. a first internal cysteine is always followed by four amino acids - often serine and glycine rich - and completed by the second cysteine .figure  <dig>

the cdr3-h amino acid composition was analyzed for the unselected hal9/ <dig> libraries . the amino acid usage at each position is shown for cdrs with up to  <dig> aa in length. the cdr3-h often starts with an alanine and arginine in the first two positions and throughout the whole cdr the amino acids glutamate, serine, tyrosine and glycine are favored. at the last three positions the “fdy” motive of the ighj <dig> segment is often found. significantly, the cdr3-h amino acid usage found in selected scfvs is largely the same compared to the amino acid usage in the initial libraries .figure  <dig>

for the cdr3-l length distribution of hal <dig>  before and after selection  <dig> sequences of the unselected library and  <dig> sequences of selected antibodies were analyzed . in the unselected library the cdr <dig> length ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> aa with a median length of about  <dig> aa. the most common cdr <dig> length for lambda light chains are  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> aa that account together for more than 80% of all found cdr3-l lengths. after selection, cdrs with a length of  <dig> aa were found more frequently and the occurrence of cdrs with a length of  <dig> aa was decreased. cdr3-l length distribution of hal <dig>  was analyzed with  <dig> sequences of the unselected library and  <dig> sequences of selected antibodies . in the unselected library the cdr <dig> length ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. most kappa light chains are bearing a cdr <dig> with a length of  <dig> aa  and the length distribution did not change significantly after selection.

the cdr3-l amino acid distribution of the unselected libraries was analyzed separately for lambda and kappa light chains. the amino acid usage at each position is shown for cdrs with up to  <dig> aa in length for lambda light chains  and for cdrs with up to  <dig> aa in length for kappa light chains . at most positions of the light chain cdr <dig>  the usage of amino acids is restricted, e.g. 70% of antibodies have a aspartate at lambda cdr <dig> position  <dig>  or 90% have a proline at kappa cdr <dig> position  <dig>  but there is still a quite high diversity found in amino acid usage throughout the whole cdr. again, the cdr3-l amino acid distribution found in selected scfvs is almost the same when compared to the amino acid usage of the initial libraries hal9/ <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
since the development of phagemids for antibody phage display by breitling et al.  <cit> , the technology was continuously further developed.

the most used phage display vectors have the tag order his-myc when using both tags, e.g. pcantab3his  <cit> , pces  <cit> , phen <dig>  <cit> , phal <dig>  <cit> , pit <dig>  <cit> , pmod <dig>  <cit>  or pmid <dig>  <cit> . to our knowledge, there is only one phage display vector using the opposite orientation: psd <dig>  <cit> . comparing both tag orders, the myc-his order  results in improved production of functional scfv compared to his-myc  whereas the display of functional scfv on phage is not effected.

using a kappa  and a lambda  antibody gene library in the same selection, we have observed that the output of selected kappa antibodies was always lower compared to lambda antibodies  <cit> . løset et al. and tiller et al. also describe a lower production yield of kappa scfvs or fabs compared to lambda antibodies that confirms our observation with the hal libraries  <cit> . the scfv design in phal <dig> included the first six amino acids of ch <dig> as part of the linker and the first  <dig> amino acids of cl lambda, respectively the first nine amino acids of cl kappa. the last amino acid in cl kappa used in the scfv design is a phenylalanine. phenylalanine is encoded by only two codons which may lead to a reduced translation and has a bulky hydrophobic benzol side group which may hamper solubility. in projects with macaque immune libraries using also phal <dig> and derived phal vectors, the phenylalanine was omitted. the selected kappa scfv were produced well, leading to a generation of kappa scfv against different targets  <cit> . for human scfv, deletion of phenylalanine improved the expression rate of known kappa antibodies and randomly chosen kappa clones. this modification increased the rate of selected kappa antibodies from 4% using hal4/7/ <dig> to  <dig> % when using hal9/ <dig> 

using the novel vector phal <dig> and scfv design, two new universal human naive antibody gene libraries were constructed. the theoretical diversity of the hal9/ <dig> libraries is with  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones in the same range like other published scfv or fab libraries with a theoretical diversity in the range of 1x1010-1x <dig>  e.g. the naive mccafferty scfv library   <cit> , the naive pfizer scfv library   <cit> , the naive cat <dig>  scfv library   <cit> , the naive/synthetic dyax fab   <cit>  library, the synthetic ylanthia fab library   <cit>  or very recently published the philodiamond scfv library   <cit> .

the representation of antibody subfamilies in the hal9/ <dig> libraries is comparable with the hal7/ <dig> library  <cit> , it differs only in some minor points, e.g. vh <dig>  vκ <dig> and vλ <dig> are more abundant in hal9/ <dig>  in general, vh gene usage is dominated by vh <dig> and vh <dig>  dominant vl are usually vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  vκ <dig> and vκ <dig> and vλ by vλ <dig>  vλ <dig>  vλ <dig> and vλ <dig>  in the new libraries, the distribution of v genes is comparable with their frequency in vivo  <cit>  but with following exceptions. the subfamily vh <dig> is more abundant in vivo whereas vκ <dig> and vλ <dig> are more frequent in hal antibody gene libraries and rare in vivo. the main difference is the frequency of vλ1 > vλ2 > vλ <dig> in vivo compared to vλ3 > vλ1 > vλ <dig> in hal9/ <dig>  the ylanthia library  <cit>  fits perfectly with the in vivo distribution. the distribution of v genes for vh and vκ of hal9/ <dig> is in accordance with the pfizer library  <cit> . a comparison of vλ with hal <dig> is not possible, because the pfizer library lacks most vλ genes. compared to hal9/ <dig>  the distribution of v genes in the cat <dig>  library  <cit>  differs more from in vivo situation. here, vh is dominated by vh <dig> and vκ is dominated by one vκ <dig> gene. with ~ <dig> amino acids, the average hal9/ <dig> cdr-h <dig> length is longer than in the naive pfizer  <cit>  or synthetic ylanthia  <cit>  libraries , but slightly shorter compared to the dyax library with ~ <dig> amino acids  <cit> . in addition more very long cdr-h <dig>  are found in hal9/ <dig> compared to the pfizer library. the average length of cdr-l <dig> for λ is eleven amino acids and therefore two amino acids longer as the average length of cdr-l <dig> for κ. in hal9/ <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> different aa are occurring at each cdr-h <dig> position whereas for ylanthia  <dig> to  <dig> different aa are possible at each position, planned by rational design  <cit> . in ylanthia, the cdr-h <dig> is dominated by serine, tyrosine and glycine . in the naive hal9/ <dig> libraries, the amino acid repertoire in cdr-h <dig> is more balanced, but the frequency of tyrosine increases from n’terminus to c’terminus as well .

significantly, within the group of selected scfvs, the representation of vh antibody subfamilies is largely in accordance with the mccafferty library  <cit>  and pfizer library  <cit> , but not with the cat <dig>  library  <cit> , where vh is dominated by vh1 > vh <dig> compared to vh3 > vh <dig> for mccafferty, hal9/ <dig> or pfizer library. for vκ, more vκ <dig> than vκ <dig> were selected from hal <dig> or mccafferty, whereas from pfizer or cat <dig>  mostly vκ <dig> were selected. regarding vλ, here vλ1- <dig> and  <dig> are mainly isolated from mccaffery and hal <dig>  whereas vλ <dig> is rarely selected from cat <dig> . the frequency of selected vh <dig>  vκ <dig> and vλ <dig> antibodies from hal9/ <dig> is very low compared with the frequency in the initial library. the same was observed for hal7/ <dig>  <cit>  and cat <dig>   <cit> . the vh4- <dig> antibody gene is described as toxic for b-cells  <cit> . as consequence, two vh4- <dig> and vh4- <dig> genes were excluded when constructing the synthetic ylanthia library, despite the fact, that these vh <dig> genes are very frequent in the natural human antibody repertoire  <cit> . remarkably, a majority of antibodies selected from macaque immune antibody gene libraries against botulinum a toxin are vh <dig> antibodies, especially vh4- <dig>  <cit> . the macaque antibody genes are very similar to their human counterparts. therefore, the vh <dig> gene family may be preadapted to some targets, or at least best suited to structurally complement the respective epitopes.

the average cdr length of cdr-h <dig> is only very slightly shorter after selection compared with the initial library, presumably due to a better growth of bacteria producing shorter antibody genes during antibody selection. the length of the cdr-l <dig> does not significantly differ in selected antibodies. the cdr composition in the cdr-l <dig> is completely different between λ and κ light chains, giving a hint why two different kinds of light chains have been evolved. very importantly, the frequency of amino acids at each cdr <dig> position does not significantly change after selection, clearly demonstrating that any bacterial expression bias is minor, and all amino acids used in the naive human gene repertoire can be found in selected, functional antibodies.

some vh-genes are preferred after selection, e.g. vh1- <dig>  vh1- <dig>  vh3- <dig>  vh3- <dig>  these are also v-genes often used in ylanthia  <cit>  and cat <dig>   <cit> . notably, the very common vh3- <dig> gene results in a low igg <dig> expression rate, but is most frequent in the natural human antibody repertoire  <cit> . this v-gene is a very stable and was used also for semisynthetic libraries, e.g. tomlinson library  <cit> . for κ light chain, igkv1- <dig>  igkv1d- <dig>  igkv1d- <dig> and igkv3- <dig> are selected frequently. igkv3- <dig> is the most used κ gene in the natural repertoire and is used for ylanthia  <cit> . the λ v-genes iglv1- <dig>  iglv1- <dig>  iglv2- <dig>  iglv3- <dig>  iglv3- <dig> and iglv6- <dig> were most frequently found after hal selection. iglv2- <dig> is the most used λ v-gene in the natural antibody repertoire and is used for ylanthia, iglv1- <dig> and iglv1- <dig> are also often used in nature, but iglv1- <dig> was excluded from the ylanthia design  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the naive antibody gene libraries hal9/ <dig> have unique features compared to the libraries published earlier. the libraries have a slightly greater maximum diversity than the mccafferty library, they comprise more lambda v-genes and have longer cdr-h <dig> compared to the pfizer library, the distribution of v-genes resembles more the natural antibody repertoire compared to cat <dig>  and they show more cdr-h <dig> diversity than ylanthia. the successful generation of > <dig> antibodies against > <dig> targets with overwhelming success and in short time with miniaturized systems illustrates the huge advances in human library construction and use achieved since the first description of this method.
