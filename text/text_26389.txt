BACKGROUND
rice is the most economically important crop in the world and is the principal cereal in the human diet, supplying humanity with 23% of its calories, followed by wheat  and maize   <cit> . the genus oryza consists of two cultivated species, o. sativa  and o. glaberrima , and more than  <dig> wild species, many of which are consumed in the human diet in certain regions of the world. the wild species of oryza, representing the aa, bb, cc, bbcc, ccdd, dd, ff, gg, hhjj and hhkk genomes provide an important pool of useful genes for rice improvement  <cit> .

the red rice, oryza longistaminata, is a rhizomatous perennial wild rice species native to africa and considered a noxious weed in the united states. it is believed to be the wild progenitor of o. glabberrima. the genome of o. longistaminata is type aa, similar to o. sativa. this species is characterized by a number of valuable traits that could be used for improvement of rice cultivars, including long anther  <cit> , large biomass  <cit> , high nitrogen use efficiency  <cit> , resistance to insect pests and disease  <cit> , and the rhizomatous trait. elucidation of the genetic origin of the rhizomatous trait might facilitate the generation of a perennial form of cultivated rice that would help to reduce soil erosion associated with annual tillage.

rhizomes are essential organs to many perennial species by enabling overwintering and allowing rapid growth at the beginning of the next growing season  <cit> . plants regrowing from rhizomes have the potential for greater vigor and faster early growth than plants grown in a traditional ratoon system  <cit> . o. longistaminata is the most logical donor of perenniality for cultivated rice because of its strong rhizome features and relatively high pollen fertility compared to other wild rice species. however, hybrid sterility is currently a considerable barrier to rapid development of o. longistaminata/o. sativa crosses  <cit> .

a cross between cultivated sorghum and the perennial grass, sorghum propinquum, was made in an effort to map genes for rhizome development  <cit> . some genes with rhizome-enriched expression were identified in the sorghum rhizome species johnsongrass  and s. propinquum   <cit> , in bamboo   <cit> , and especially in red rice   <cit> . the combined results from those investigations indicated that a complex gene regulatory network may underlie rhizome development and growth.

despite the significance of rhizomes in red rice, little is known about the molecular basis of rhizome growth, development, and function in this species. to broaden our understanding of the global gene expression profiles of o. longistaminata rhizomes and to identify the genes and proteins involved in rhizome development and function, we utilized the next-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms illumina gaii and hiseq  <dig> to sequence the rhizome transcriptome and to compare gene expression profiles of rhizomes with other tissues, respectively. in parallel, we employed label-free quantitative proteomics that utilized gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  to globally query the proteome of rhizome and root tissues. we also investigated primary metabolite and hormone levels in the rhizome and other plant tissues. we then compared the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic results to investigate rhizome specificity and identify genes, proteins and metabolites that appear to play important roles in rhizome development and function. the data and results can be viewed at http://www.plantrhizome.org.

RESULTS
transcriptomics and differential expression analysis
we collected rhizome apical tips , the neighboring elongation zones , whole rhizome  and other tissue samples  from o. longistaminata plants at the active tillering stage . the total transcriptomes from rhizome elongation zone and apical tip tissues, as well as rna-seq data from other tissues, were obtained using illumina-based next-generation sequencing technology , yielding more than  <dig> million 100 bp reads from the rhizome tip and  <dig> million from the rhizome zone, as well as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million 50 bp reads from whole rhizome, root, leaf and stem tissue samples, respectively. in total, we obtained  <dig> gb of transcriptome data with more than  <dig>  million cleaned reads, of which  <dig>  million reads were assembled as described in the methods section to generate  <dig>  unigenes . the assembled transcriptomic data amount was 101 mb  with an average gc content of 45%, ranging from  <dig> to 84% per unigene .

note: unigenes- the consensus transcript sequences; rpkm - reads per kb per million reads; go - gene ontology; orf - open reading frame.

of the  <dig>  total unigenes from the “olr”  database,  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated as matching a known gene in the uniprot or planttfdb databases. while the majority of the  <dig>  annotated unigenes were homologous to genes from plants ,  <dig>   unigenes matched fungal genes, which were mainly assigned to the rhizome tissues   and  <dig>   matched invertebrate, vertebrate and viral genes.

the majority of the annotated genes had expression levels of at least  <dig>  rpkm. this included  <dig> genes expressed in any rhizome tissue,  <dig>  found in all rhizome tissues, and  <dig>  expressed in root,  <dig>  in stem, and  <dig>  in leaf. a small fraction of the genes were specifically expressed in only one tissue, having an rpkm value of at least  <dig>  in one tissue but zero from all other tissues:  <dig>  unigenes from any rhizome tissue,  <dig>  only in root,  <dig> in stem, and  <dig> in leaf. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were common to all tissues using an expression level of  <dig>  rpkm as a cutoff value .

 <dig>  fungal unigenes were assigned to  <dig> fungal species with the highest number of unigenes  from magnaporthe oryzae. in the list of top  <dig> most abundantly expressed fungal unigenes , five unigenes were from magnaporthe oryzae and the rest of them  were from  <dig> different fungal species. most of these unigenes had higher expression levels in rhizome and root than in leaf and stem. one unigene, olr_ <dig>  had 20-fold higher expression in rhizome than in root, but another unigene, olr_ <dig>  had 20-fold high expression in root than in rhizome. the single most abundant unigene  was assigned to fungal species ustilago maydis with high expression levels in all tissues .

interestingly,  <dig>   of the  <dig>  unigenes expressed specifically in the rhizome were homologous to fungal genes, with  <dig>   being from m. oryzae, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen that causes rice blast. the remaining rhizome-specific genes included genes assigned to plants , invertebrates , vertebrates  and other fungi besides m. oryzae . among the remaining 20% fungal genes, most were homologous to colletotrichum genes with the highest relative abundance . thielavia  was the second most abundant group, followed by neurospora , chaetomium , hypocrea/trichoderma , podospora , grosmannia , nectria , fusarium , metarhizium  and aspergillus , etc. .

some of these fungal species are resistant to abiotic stress such as heat or extreme environments. for example, thielavia is a thermophilic fungus, and may play roles in biomass conversion  <cit> . chaetomium thermophilum is also thermophilic. the unigenes of thermophilic fungi had relatively higher expression levels in rhizome tissues than other tissues . some fungi are endophytic, such as chaetomium globosum. these endophytic fungi produce antifungal metabolites and were used for biocontrol of rice blast  <cit> , wheat leaf rust  <cit> , potato late blight  <cit>  and corn leaf blight  <cit> . the species of hypocrea/trichoderma are also well studied as biocontrol agents with the ability to interact with plant roots/rhizomes and act as plant symbionts to generate cell wall hydrolytic enzymes and antagonistic secondary metabolites to compete against soil-borne pathogens  <cit> . members of the genus metarhizium include fungi pathogenic to insects, produce insecticidally active compounds  <cit>  and were used to develop biocontrol alternatives to chemical insecticides in agricultural and disease-vector control programs  <cit> . although the genera podospora, grosmannia, nectria, fusarium and colletotrichum contain plant pathogens and cause serious plant disease, some of them such as colletotrichum species are also frequently identified as endophytes, which are commonly isolated from healthy plants, including medicinal plants and rhizome species  <cit> . m. oryzae acts as a pathogen to numerous plant species, especially to cultivated rice, but it may be present as an endophyte in red rice. it is dominant in the rhizome tissue and may function as either a beneficial endophyte or pathogen depending on the circumstances and plant hosts.

the fact that the genes from thermophilic fungi, entomopathogenic fungi and endophytic fungi were dominant in the rhizome tissues and some of these showed high expression levels indicated that these fungal genes may play important roles in rhizome tissue. there is increasing evidence that many fungi behave as endophytes in plants, especially in grasses  <cit> , and they may be involved in plant defense against pathogens and insect pests  <cit> . moreover, fungal endosymbionts may play roles in conferring plant abiotic stress tolerance  <cit>  or may affect the biosynthesis and accumulation of bioactive metabolites  <cit> . in recent years, endophytes, especially those from medicinal plants, rhizome species and invasive species have become the focus of research for identification of bioactive compounds  <cit> , for invasive plant management and plant community biodiversity  <cit> .

on the other hand, just  <dig> of  <dig>  root-specific annotated unigenes appeared to be fungal genes with  <dig> from m. oryzae and four from colletotrichum. the others included aspergillus , chaetomium , hypocrea/trichoderma , thielavia , etc. interestingly, there were  <dig> unigenes that were homologus to coprinopsis cinerea, and some of these genes showed high expression levels, but only one unigene from coprinopsis cinerea was found to be specifically expressed in the rhizome. in addition, a unigene, olr_ <dig>  encoding a cellobiohydrolase from irpex lacteus showed very high expression levels  and was specifically expressed in the root tissues . an ornithine decarboxylase gene assigned to glomus intraradices was also detected in root. glomus intraradices is an arbuscular mycorrhizal  fungus used as a soil inoculant in agriculture and horticulture. these results indicated that different fungal species exist in root and rhizome tissues of red rice and that they express some genes to levels that exceeded those of the host plant. notably, rhizome tissues supported a more abundant and diverse fungal population, and appeared to particularly host magnaporthe oryzae.

among the  <dig>  unigenes that were derived from fungal endophytes/symbionts or pathogens/contaminants, the average expression levels  were  <dig>  in leaf,  <dig>  in stem,  <dig>  in root,  <dig>  in rhizome tip and  <dig>  in rhizome elongation zone . in comparison, the rpkm values of plant genes were much more consistent and higher, with an average rpkm of  <dig>  in leaf,  <dig>  in stem,  <dig>  in root, and  <dig>  in both tip and zone . these results indicated that the fungal-related genes were more highly expressed in the rhizome tissue, especially in the rhizome elongation zone, compared to other tissues. for example, the unigene  assigned to alcohol oxidase of m. oryzae was specifically expressed in the rhizome tissue . this gene was reported to be highly expressed both in appressoria and conidia/mycelia of m. oryzae <cit> , and is a pathogenicity factor gene that was induced by plant-derived signals and carbon starvation, but repressed by nitrogen starvation  <cit> . furthermore, using specific primers of the m. oryzae alcohol oxidase gene, we detected the alcohol oxidase gene in conidia/mycelia that was induced and purified from healthy rhizome tissues , indicating that m. oryzae was present in red rice rhizomes.

the identification of so many m. oryzae genes within red rice was a bit surprising, as the plants used in this investigation did not show symptoms of rice blast disease . indeed, none of the red rice plants grown over the past several years in our greenhouses have shown symptoms of rice blast. however, cytological and molecular analysis shows that conidia and hyphae of m. oryzae are indeed present in the healthy rhizome tissue . taken together, the cytological, transcriptomic and proteomic data  indicated that red rice , as has been found for other wild rice species and some cultivated land races, may be resistant to m. oryzae and may even harbor the fungus as an endophyte in a non-pathogenic relationship within the rhizome. being a potential carrier of rice blast, red rice thus must possess means to control spread within the plant of m. oryzae , and may have genes that could be transferred to cultivated rice to endow the latter with the same resistance characteristics. identification of such genes will be a critical component of future comparative genomics-based investigations of these two species. in the case of o. rhizomatis, another rhizomatous wild rice species , a unique nbs-lrr gene containing a zinc finger domain has been identified, termed pi54rh, which may confer resistance to rice blast and is significantly upregulated in response to infection initiation  <cit> . a close homolog of that gene  and represented by unigene olr_ <dig> in our dataset was expressed in all red rice tissues examined and may be partially responsible for resistance in red rice. however, it was only slightly upregulated in the rhizome than in other parts of the plant, and thus does not correlate well with the large fraction of m. oryzae transcripts found in the rhizome.

in addition to rhizome-specific genes, we were interested in identifying genes that were preferentially expressed in the rhizome compared to other tissues. the sequence data from the three rhizome tissues were combined and compared to the non-rhizome tissues using edger  <cit> . at a p-value <  <dig> , there were  <dig>  de  unigenes compared to root,  <dig>  compared to stem, and  <dig>  compared to leaf. there were  <dig>  de unigenes between the rhizome tissues and all non-rhizome tissues . breaking this down, there were  <dig>  unigenes differentially expressed between the apical tip and the non-rhizome tissues,  <dig>  de unigenes between the zone and the non-rhizome tissues, and  <dig>  de unigenes between whole rhizome and the non-rhizome tissues.

the results above that outline the detection of fungal gene in the rhizomes is supported by the following de results. the olr database has 372 k unique hits to plants and 155 k unique hits to fungus, of which  <dig>  have the best e-value hit to fungus and  <dig>  of those were to m. oryzae. of the  <dig>  rhizome de unigenes,  <dig> had their best hit to fungus, of which  <dig> were from m. oryzae. in contrast, root has  <dig>  de genes compared with all other libraries, where  <dig> of those were of fungal origin and  <dig> were from m. oryzae. thus, m. oryzae appeared to be localized mostly to the rhizome, based on gene expression data.

differential expression analysis was also applied to go categories using goseq  <cit> , comparing combined rhizome tissues to root, stem, and leaf. the top two biological process categories identified in that analysis were “response to stimulus” and “multi-organism process”. the top three cellular component categories were “extracellular region”, “membrane” and “cell junction”. the top molecular functions were “antioxidant activity” and “electron carrier activity”. these data were used to focus efforts to identify specific genes that may play important roles in determining the growth, development, differentiation and function of the rhizomes of red rice, as outlined below.

rhizome-enriched genes
among the genes identified as being differentially expressed in rhizome compared to other tissues ,  <dig>  displayed > 2-fold higher expression levels in the rhizome. we further identified  <dig> unigenes/genes that were specifically expressed or highly enriched in the rhizome  , 40% of which  were related to known transcription factors, including yabby, tale, ap <dig> and bhlh etc. . this result was consistent with the previous report in which  <dig> rhizome tip-specifically expressed genes were identified , including  <dig> transcription regulation related genes  <cit> . other classes of genes that would be expected to play important roles in rhizome growth and development were also identified, some with preferential expression in either the apical tip or the elongation zone.

importantly, some classes of phytohormone  and stress response related genes likely play key roles in the regulation of rhizome development and environmental responses  <cit> . indeed, in the red rice transcriptome dataset, we found  <dig> phytohormone-related unigenes/genes, including genes related to the production, sensing and metabolism of auxin , cytokinins , ethylene , brassinosteroids , gibberellins  and abscisic acid  . in particular, up-regulated genes in the rhizome included those encoding gibberellin stimulated transcript related protein  <dig> , ethylene receptor-like protein  <dig> , auxin-responsive protein iaa <dig>  and auxin response factor  <dig> . other putative phytohormone-related genes were down-regulated in rhizome relative to the leaf, stem and root, such as an auxin-responsive protein, iaa <dig> , auxin-induced protein-like protein  and cytokinin dehydrogenase  <dig> . similar results were also observed in the previous study  <cit>  that compared isolated rnas from o. longistaminata to the o. sativa genome via use of affymetrix chip hybridization. however, because these genes were sequenced de novo in our investigation, the possibility of cross or non-specific hybridization that could have occurred in the previous study was eliminated, providing stronger evidence for involvement of these genes in rhizome-specific processes. thus, these genes may play essential roles in the regulation of rhizome development and environmental responses in red rice.

in addition, expansin family genes, growth-regulating factor genes and other stress-related genes such as β-glucosidases, heat shock genes, drought-induced s-like ribonuclease genes, disease resistance genes, an lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase and an nb-arc domain containing protein appear to be preferentially expressed in the rhizome tissue. for example, expansin-a <dig> may function in loosening and extension of plant cell walls and may be involved in elongation of internodes during submergence of rice  <cit> , or in red rice in this case. β-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and activation of phytohormones and chemical defense compounds  <cit> . the exact role that these enzymes play in red rice rhizome is yet to be determined. the lrr receptor-like protein kinase gene was highly expressed in other plant species in regions undergoing cell division and elongation and was induced by gibberellins  <cit> . most receptor-like kinases  identified as being involved in plant defense are of the lrr-rlk class, including the rice xa <dig> protein  <cit> . the nb-arc  domain is usually associated with resistance  proteins in plants, conferring specificity to the innate immune system  <cit> . further characterization of these genes/proteins may reveal roles in invasiveness, underground defense and rhizome development in red rice.

of specific interest with regards to rhizome growth and development are  <dig> genes that were the most highly and specifically expressed in the rhizome compared to other tissues . of these,  <dig> are transcription factors, belonging to yabby, bzip, tale and bhlh gene families. others included a sesquiterpene synthase, proline-rich proteins, a papain-like cysteine proteinase and an o-methyltransferase.

plant o-methyltransferases  are known to be involved in methylation of plant specialized metabolites, especially phenylpropanoids and flavonoids that may be involved in defense against pathogens or insect pests  <cit> . proline-rich proteins  are plant cell wall proteins and expression of prps is influenced by factors associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. however, increasing evidence suggests that the prp proteins may have important roles in normal development and function in determining cell-type-specific wall structures during plant development, affecting cold-tolerance  <cit>  or disease resistance  <cit>  in rice. these genes likely play similar roles in red rice rhizome tissues. papain-like cysteine proteases  play crucial roles in plant–pathogen/pest interactions  <cit> . since the rhizome is an underground stem and is potentially continuously challenged by biotic  and abiotic  stresses, the high expression of these stress and resistance-related genes in the rhizome tissue would contribute to its ability compete in its environment and perhaps may enable its invasiveness.

a total of  <dig>   identified genes showed significant homology to known plant transcription factors   <cit> . transcription factors  play a critical role in regulating the expression of genes involved in various physiological and developmental processes, including rhizome development. indeed, a number of tf genes were specifically expressed or highly enriched in the rhizome , especially members of the yabby and bhlh families. members of the yabby family have been shown to be preferentially expressed in immature organs containing meristems and organ primordial, and this tf family appears to be involved in various functions regulating organ formation  <cit>  and gibberellin metabolism  <cit> . their high expression in red rice’s rhizome apical tip supports these functions. genes in this family may therefore be very important for rhizome growth and development. the bhlh superfamily has been found to have large number of functions in essential physiological and developmental processes in plants. for example, in arabidopsis, bhlh genes have been shown to be involved in regulating the differentiation of trichomes  <cit> , and a bhlh transcription factor, upbeat <dig> , modulates the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation by directly regulating the expression of a set of peroxidases in the root  <cit> . in maize, a putative bhlh transcription factor, teosinte branched <dig> , is involved in lateral branching and accounts partly for morphological differences in axillary branching between maize and teosinte  <cit> . the rice tb <dig> gene  functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice  <cit> . thus, the bhlh and yabby genes expressed in red rice rhizome apical tip and elongation zone may play important roles in establishing and maintaining apical dominance and in enabling fast linear invasive growth of this species.

a putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression in the rhizome producing species, johnsongrass   <cit> . in our dataset, we also found an oligosaccharyl transferase gene with relatively high expression levels in rhizome tissues, but which also showed high expression levels in other tissues  . what role this gene plays in red rice and johnsongrass is not clear, but it likely has a role in determining cell wall composition, and may therefore be a downstream protein compared to regulatory genes involved in differentiation and growth of rhizomes.

in contrast, we found four sesquiterpene synthase genes with high and specific expression levels in the rhizome, with three  of them showing extremely high expression  in rhizome tissues including rhizome tip, zone and whole rhizome, but with very low expression  in root, stem and leaf . this class of enzyme converts the isoprenoid pathway intermediate, farnesyl diphosphate, into hundreds of different sesquiterpenoids, which are important for plant defense against herbivores as well as for attraction of pollinators  <cit> , among other functions. some sesquiterpene synthase genes have been cloned and characterized from maize, such as stc <dig>  <cit>  and tps <dig>  <cit> . those genes produce chemical defense signals to attract natural enemies of herbivores. furthermore, plant terpenoid formation is not only responsive to environmental  cues, but is also related to developmental processes  <cit> . for example, upregulation of sesquiterpene synthase genes in arabidopsis floral organs is certainly related to flower development  <cit> . floral volatile terpenes also play an important role in the attraction of a variety of pollinators and thus have important implications for plant reproduction  <cit> . the rhizome serves as the primary energy storage and propagation/reproduction organ of rhizomatous species like red rice.

high expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes in red rice rhizome as demonstrated in this study may support the hypothesis that rhizomatous terpenoids may also play important roles in rhizome development and reproduction, perhaps acting as signaling molecules, approaching hormone function, or being major players in the rhizome chemical defense arsenal. in arabidopsis, a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor, myc <dig>  directly binds to promoters of the sesquiterpene synthase genes tps <dig> and tps <dig> and activates their expression. myc <dig> is also connected to ga signaling by regulating a subset of ga-responsive genes  <cit> . interestingly, in this study, we also found that a number of bhlh transcription factor genes were highly and specifically expressed in the rhizome tissue , together with high expression of these sesquiterpene synthase genes . further investigation of the molecular mechanisms and interactions of specific members of the bhlh family, terpene synthase genes/gene products and phytohormones in rhizome tissue, the subject of future work, will provide valuable data to our understanding of rhizome development and function. comparison to other rhizomatous species will enable us to determine whether these roles are conserved in the plant kingdom, or are specific to individual species.

o. longistaminata rhizome and root proteomes
a label free gelc-ms/ms approach was employed to identify and determine the relative abundance of proteins present in rhizome tissues  and roots of o. longistaminata. using this approach, we were able to identify nearly  <dig>  mass spectra per biological replicate and  <dig>  non-redundant peptides with a false discovery rate  of less than 1% at the protein level.

in total,  <dig>  non-redundant protein groups  were identified among the  <dig> biological replicates. only proteins detected in at least  <dig> biological replicates were considered for downstream analysis of differentially regulated proteins between rhizomes  and root tissues. a total of  <dig>  proteins were reproducibly detected among the biological replicates. the highest number of proteins identified was found in the tip  followed by roots  and finally the elongation zone  .

among the  <dig>  non-redundant proteins,  <dig> were of fungal origin. interestingly,  <dig>  of these were from magnaporthe oryzae, with some being highly expressed in rhizome apical tip and/or rhizome elongation zone . for example, an atp-dependent rna helicase, fal <dig> , was detected at much higher levels in rhizome tissues than in root, especially in the rhizome tip. other fungal proteins up-regulated in rhizome tissues included gtp-binding nuclear protein gsp <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  small copii coat gtpase sar <dig> and t-complex protein  <dig> subunit alpha . the other  <dig> fungal proteins were from the genera neurospora , colletotrichum , podospora , chaetomium  and thielavia , etc. this result was consistent with the transcriptome analyses where many m. oryzae unigenes were detected, especially in the rhizome tissues , and confirmed the presence of this fungus within the red rice tissues.

to detect rhizome-characteristic proteins , pairwise comparisons and go analysis were carried out: tip versus roots and zone versus roots. from this analysis, we detected  <dig> up-regulated rhizome proteins termed here as rhizome-characteristic proteins . to determine differences within the rhizome tissues , the up-regulated proteins identified in the apical tip and elongation zone compared to roots were pairwise compared, thereby detecting proteins highly enriched in only one rhizome tissue in relation to roots, and not included in the previously list of  <dig> rhizome characteristic proteins. a total of  <dig> proteins showed differential regulation between rhizome tissues .

in addition, we mapped the red rice rhizome protein distributions within the go categories, biological process and molecular function . the results of this analysis showed that in the biological process category, the subcategories “cellular process” was the most abundant, followed by “metabolic process” and “response to stimulus”, and in the molecular function category, the subcategory “binding” was the most abundant, followed by “catalytic activity” and “structural molecule activity” . considering the actively growing state of the tissues used in this comparison, these results are not surprising.

the proteomic results were generally consistent with the transcriptomic results, especially for those unigenes/proteins that have high expression levels in rhizome tissues , such as sucrose synthase  <dig> , tubulin alpha- <dig> chain , heat shock protein , translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . however, for some highly expressed unigenes, no associated peptides/proteins could be detected, such as for cytochrome p <dig> like tbp  and senescence-associated protein . this could be explained by both biological processes and technical limitations inherent to the detection methods and the nature of the proteins in question  <cit> . a similar result was found for some genes examined in previous work with glandular trichomes  <cit>  and developing seed  <cit> . our previous work with common reed rhizome also suggested that steady state transcript and protein levels are often not proportional.

detecting those proteins that are not concordant with transcript levels helps to reveal examples of post-transcriptional regulation. indeed, we detected some proteins in the certain tissues whose transcript levels were not consistent with protein expression levels. there is a growing body of evidence that although in many cases protein levels are determined by transcriptional control, in other cases mrna transcription profiles are poor predictors of protein levels because of numerous post-transcriptional regulatory activities and post-translational events that generate a high diversity of proteins  <cit> . in some cases, protein abundances are more conserved than mrna abundances  <cit> . as a consequence, it is likely that the two complementary approaches  used in the present work would provide a more comprehensive picture of the mechanisms that determine and control rhizomatousness in species like o. longistaminata.

ten rhizome-characteristic proteins were 40s and 60s ribosomal proteins, which presented similar expression levels in apical tip and elongation zone . another six ribosomal proteins were up-regulated in tip compared to elongation zone . these proteins are related to cell differentiation in meristematic tissues  <cit>  and recently were also found to be enriched in the apical tip of equisentum rhizomes  <cit> . an orthologous protein to the human proliferation-associated protein  <dig> g <dig> , involved in ribosome biogenesis and organ growth in arabidopsis  <cit> , was also detected in higher levels in rhizome tissues, especially within the apical tip. another protein up-regulated in rhizome tissues was the t-complex protein  <dig> . three accessions were found for this protein, each comprising a different subunit , and were more highly expressed in tip compared to the elongation zone. tcp <dig> participates in the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol, including tubulins and actins  <cit> . consistent with this finding, an actin- <dig> and two tubulins  were also found to be enriched at similar levels in both rhizome tissues. actins and tubulins have been reported to accumulate in meristematic tissues  <cit>  and are involved in cell elongation  <cit> . in addition, a villin- <dig> protein, which is involved with the regulation of actin filament formation and stability  <cit> , was up-regulated in the elongation zone compared to tip, reinforcing the idea that proteins related to the cytoskeleton may have an important role during rhizome growth and development. proteins up-regulated in rhizome tip compared to the elongation zone  were mainly related to protein fate , protein synthesis  and rna processing , which would be expected due to the high level of cell division and transcription in this tissue. thus, the proteomics data paint a picture where proteins involved in cell division, differentiation and growth are actively expressed in the rhizome apical tip and elongation zone and support the transcriptomic results.

red rice metabolite profiling
using a standard metabolite profiling approach, with gc-tofms identification and quantification, we detected and quantified  <dig> primary metabolites from red rice rhizome apical tip, rhizome elongation zone, stem, leaf and root tissues, including  <dig> sugars,  <dig> organic acids,  <dig> amino acids and others . as shown in figure  <dig>  all tissues were unique in their overall metabolite profiles, even the two rhizome tissues, the apical tip and the elongation zone. in general, the rhizome tissues had higher levels of sugars, on average, than the leaf, stem and root. fructose and sucrose were the first and second most abundant sugars in the rhizome tip and zone, followed by glucose-1-phosphate in the tip and mannose in the zone . these were the most abundant sugars in the other tissues as well. compared with the other tissues , however, the concentrations of three sugars  were more than 10-fold higher in the rhizome tissues. interestingly, although glycerol was not particularly abundant in the rhizome tissues, it was found at  <dig> -fold higher levels in the tip than in the rhizome zone . these results suggest that critical metabolites involved in cell division and expansion are targeted to the apical tip and elongation zone.

note: n.d. = not detected. relative intensity = relative compound intensity normalized to the lowest value per compound. se = standard error.

among  <dig> organic acids, l-malate, citrate, and quinate were the most abundant , especially in the rhizome tissues. in addition, the concentrations of 4-hydroxymandelate and allantoate were more than 15-fold higher in the rhizome tissues than in other tissues. a previous study suggested that allantoate and allantoin are the principal forms of nitrogen transported from nodulated roots to shoots of the soybean plant and the site of allantoin synthesis is the nodule  <cit> . more experiments will be needed to determine what role these two compounds play in the red rice rhizome, but the current evidence suggests a role in supplying much needed nitrogen for growth and differentiation of the rhizome growing tip, especially to support amino acid biosynthesis. red rice does not possess nodules, raising the question of where these compounds are produced in this species.

rhizome tissue, especially the rhizome apical tip, contained the highest levels of amino acids compared to the other tissues . for example, the concentrations of nine amino acids  were observed to be at least 20-fold higher compared to the root, leaf, and stem. in the rhizome tissues, asparagine, glutamine and oxoproline were the top  <dig> most abundant amino acids. three amino acids  were more highly enriched in the rhizome apical tip than in the rhizome elongation zone . the roles of the non-protein amino acids are unknown in this tissue.

these results could indicate a significant metabolic difference between rhizomes and other tissues, especially the rhizome apical tip, which contains the apical meristematic region. this tissue contained significantly higher levels of many important primary metabolites compared to other tissues including root, leaf and stem. this result may be an indication of the elevated metabolic demand involved with cell division and growth that occurs in this region. it is also possible that some of the large observed differences in absolute quantification of many primary metabolites may be due to the smaller average cell size of the rhizome apical tip and elongation zone compared to the more mature tissues analyzed from the leaf, root and stem, which contain much larger vacuoles as well as fiber cells. however, cell size difference cannot explain the differences in relative abundances between different compounds and classes of compounds within these various tissues, supporting the hypothesis that metabolic processes involved with rhizome growth and differentiation are significantly different from processes in the other tissues evaluated. these results further support the hypothesis that rhizomes are very different from roots, not only in anatomy  and gene expression, but also metabolically. the fourteen compounds from the three major classes described above as the most abundant in the rhizome tissues  may be particularly important for rhizome development.

as discussed above, a number of plant hormone-related genes were identified through transcriptome sequencing. we also explored the distribution of twelve plant hormones/growth regulators in the different tissues , including gibberellins , abscisic acid , trans-zeatin, cis-zeatin, isopentenyl adenine , indole-3-acetic acid , salicylic acid , jasmonate , d-sa, d-ip, d-trans-zeatin and d-aba. four of these compounds, aba, iaa, ja and sa, were present in all tissues, whereas the others were either not detected or present at such low concentrations that they could not be quantified in the tissue sample sizes that were available for this analysis. sa was very abundant in leaf and stem, which makes sense since those are the sites where it would be expected to be synthesized. on the other hand, aba was most abundant in the rhizome tissues, being highest in the apical tip, which supports the model of growth regulator control of rhizome development that has been described  <cit> . the concentrations of three hormones  in rhizome tip were higher than in the zone. in general, aba mediates changes within the vertical stem apical meristem and inflorescences, causing bud and seed dormancy. aba is also an essential signal for plant resistance to pathogens, affecting ja biosynthesis  <cit> . its role in rhizome apical meristems remains to be elucidated, but based on the fact that the tissue used for analysis was undergoing rapid growth, it appears to play a role in rhizomes that is distinct from that played in upright stems.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to comprehensively probe the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of non-model plant species led to discovery of a number of genes and proteins that are specifically expressed in the rhizome tissues of red rice, oryza longistaminata. among these were transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes, which likely play roles in regulating rhizome differentiation and growth. a very interesting finding was the discovery of a large set of m. oryzae  genes that were preferentially expressed in the rhizome, even though these plants did not show symptoms of rice blast disease. the interaction of these genes with red rice genes likely leads to the ability of this species to be resistant to the disease. and also we found evidence for the presence of a number of endophytic fungal species in red rice, especially in the rhizome tissues. endophytes have been used as sources of antimicrobials and other biologically active specialized metabolites with pharmacological and agrochemical applications, and they are important components of plant microbiomes  <cit> . because of new improvements to sequencing technologies, investigations of plant microbiomes has been carried out in arabidopsis roots  <cit> , although the studies were mainly focused on host-specific bacterial endophyte communities. rhizomes and roots are underground organs and have similar soil/rhizosphere environments. more detailed investigation of the microbiomes of rhizomatous species, in particular fungal endophytes in rhizome tissue, will likely lead to great advances in our understanding of plant symbiosis  <cit> , growth, defense, stress tolerance, invasiveness and productivity. finally, metabolite profiling experiments further demonstrated that the rhizome tissues of red rice are significantly different from other tissues, especially the root, supporting the hypothesis that rhizomes are indeed more like stems than roots and that the rhizomes of different species likely are analogous plant organs.
