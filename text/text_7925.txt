BACKGROUND
inositol phosphates  are a series of phosphate esters of myo-inositol . ips are abundant in the natural environment and have multiple biological functions  <cit> . ip <dig>  <cit>  and other inositol polyphosphates—including ip <dig>  <cit> , ip <dig>  <cit>  and ip <dig>  <cit> —are important messengers. ip <dig> also plays important roles in rna editing  <cit> , transcription  <cit> , dna repair  <cit>  and the stress response  <cit> . in humans, ip <dig> showed significant inhibition and regulation of cancer cell growth  <cit> . ip <dig> functions as a ligand in the coi1-jaz signaling pathway  <cit>  or as a substrate for the production of other secondary metabolites, including components of the cell wall  <cit>  and raffinose  <cit> .

grain crops store excess phosphate as a single compound, inositol hexaphosphate , also known as phytic acid, which accounts for ~65–85 % of the total phosphate in grain crop seeds  <cit> . ip <dig> has been reported to be an inhibitor of the absorption of mineral nutrients such as zinc and iron  <cit>  by animals including humans because of a lack of phytase in their digestive system  <cit> . moreover, the excrement of grain-fed livestock containing ip <dig> can lead to phosphorus pollution  <cit> .

the reduction of phytic acid content is a major goal of plant-breeding programs that aim to improve the nutritional quality of crops. efforts to breed low-phytic-acid  crops have focused on the genes involved in ip metabolism and compartmentation , while the regulatory pathways for ip synthesis and accumulation have received scant attention  <cit> . moreover, although high ip <dig> content in seeds was thought to be unnecessary for plant development  <cit> , many lpa mutants showed a lethal phenotype  <cit>  or recessionary agronomic traits  <cit> , including reduced yield and reduced resistance to stress. however, the molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes of lpa plants, and the roles played by ips in plant physiology remain unclear, owing to a generally poor understanding of the synthesis and biological functions of ips in plants  <cit> . thus, further research into the functions of ips is warranted.

the synthesis of ips involves sequential phosphorylation of the inositol ring  <cit> . plants have two main ip synthesis pathways . the first is the lipid-dependent pathway, which is the main source of the secondary messenger insp <dig>  ip <dig> is then phosphorylated by inositol phosphate multikinase to form ip <dig>  the second pathway is lipid-independent and is considered the main source of ip <dig> in seeds. several steps in this pathway are unknown, e.g., no genes or proteins have been identified as responsible for the conversion of ip <dig> into ip <dig>  ip metabolism in maize is poorly understood. three genes were identified as responsible for ip metabolism in maize using a reverse-genetics technique. a maize lpa <dig> mutant was created by mutation of the zmipk gene. zmipk encodes an inositol phosphate kinase and is homologous with arabidopsis insp <dig> 5/6-kinase  <cit> . the maize line lpa <dig> is a mu-insertion mutant in which an increased level of myo-inositol and decreased levels of other ips were caused by a mutation in mik, which encodes a pfkb carbohydrate kinase-family protein named myo-inositol kinase. this protein catalyzes the production of myo-inositol monophosphate from myo-inositol and atp  <cit> . another low-phytic-acid maize mutant, termed lpa <dig>  harbored a mutation in a multidrug resistance-associated protein  atp-binding cassette  transporter, the exact molecular function of which remains unclear  <cit> . such findings increase our understanding of ip metabolism. however, further information regarding the metabolic pathways and molecular functions of ips is needed.

some genes involved in ip metabolism are present as more than one copy or as multiple splice variants. interestingly, only one of those copies or splice variants is important for ip accumulation in seeds  <cit> , while others play roles in physical development, e.g., the gene encoding myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase  is required for the suppression of cell death  <cit> . other than participating in the metabolism of ips, some genes encode multifunctional proteins involved in the regulation of complex physiological processes  <cit> , e.g., mips-silenced soybean lines show inhibited seed development  <cit> . thus, it is necessary to explore the regulation of ip metabolism and establish the link between ips and these important physiological processes.

systems biology approaches are powerful tools for exploring the links between co-regulated genes and metabolites. metabolite abundance is controlled by gene expression and enzyme activities. thus metabolite data can be combined with those of gene expression by means of correlation and other distance analyses  <cit> . moreover, the coordinated expression pattern of a set of genes indicates the functional links among them and genes associated with the same metabolic pathway are likely to be co-expressed  <cit> . the network method facilitates exploration of candidate genes and the regulatory mechanisms of a pathway  <cit> . modules  <cit> , which contain information regarding which biological processes are related to the candidate genes or metabolites, can be extracted from a co-expression network.

thus, construction of a co-expression network of genes related to ips has two advantages: first, complete coverage of all expressed functional genes, which provides information on those related to both metabolism and regulation; and second, identification of relationships between ip metabolism and other biological pathways. weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  is more effective than other network construction methods, and weighted networks are more robust and accurate than un-weighted networks  <cit> .

in this study, we constructed gene co-expression networks related to each ip by integrating transcriptome and metabolite data to explore the regulatory mechanism of ip metabolism. key nodes between ip metabolism and other biological pathways were implied from the network. three candidate genes were also predicted based on the gene co-expression network and validated by biological experiments.

RESULTS
determination and analysis of ip levels in maize seeds
ip <dig> screening in a maize germplasm collection
we screened an inbred maize collection  <cit>  to select inbred lines with significant differences in phytic acid content. four hundred twenty-five content values were obtained after removing abnormal values. the average content of phytic acid phosphors  in this inbred maize collection was  <dig>  mg/g, slightly higher than the  <dig>  mg/g reported previously  <cit> . ultimately,  <dig> line-pairs with stable ip <dig> content ratios  were obtained . the pap content of low phytic acid  lines ranged from  <dig>  mg/g to  <dig>  mg/g, and that of high phytic acid  lines from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/g . b <dig> , lv <dig> , qi <dig> , and cimbl <dig>  were selected for further monitoring of dynamic changes in ip levels because they were elite inbred lines used for breeding and genetic research, and the ip <dig> content ratios in their seeds was ≥  <dig> 

dynamic changes in ip levels in maize kernels at different developmental stages
to explore the dynamic changes and distributions of the various ips, we collected whole fresh seeds and embryos of maize at different developmental stages  and determined their ip levels by lc-ms/ms. we first examined each ip in the whole seeds of four inbred lines—b <dig> , lv <dig> , cimbl <dig>  and qi <dig> —to explore the dynamic changes in ip levels as a function of developmental stage.

ip4–ip <dig> levels were undetectable or very low in whole seeds at earlier developmental stages. thus, we next compared the ip1–ip <dig> levels in seeds at the aforementioned developmental stages . the results showed that ip <dig> displayed similar accumulation trends in each inbred line, with peaks at 12-21dap. moreover, the peak value of ip <dig> in b <dig>  was 9 days earlier than in qi <dig> . ip <dig> showed a steady trend in b <dig>  but underwent significant fluctuations in cimbl <dig> and qi <dig>  ip <dig> levels declined continuously in b <dig>  but in qi <dig> peaked at 12dap. it is also worth noting that ip <dig> and ip <dig> showed a sustained increasing trend in lv <dig> .fig.  <dig> dynamic changes in ip <dig> , ip <dig>  and ip <dig>  in the seeds of four maize inbred lines. dap: days after pollination. data for ip <dig>  ip <dig> and ip <dig> were normalized and plotted in r to assess the trends in ip levels. maize inbred lines: b <dig> , cimbl <dig> , lv <dig> , and qi <dig> 



we next determined ip levels in embryos  and compared them with the ip levels in whole seeds  of b <dig> and qi <dig>  the results showed that ips accumulated mainly in embryos, as indicated by content ratios considerably greater than  <dig> . moreover, ips with higher phosphate numbers—such as ip <dig> and ip6—were not detected before 21dap in whole seeds . for example, in contrast with b <dig>  ip <dig> was not detected before 21dap in qi <dig> ; ip <dig> was first detectable in embryos at 21dap, and its levels were significantly higher in embryos than in the whole kernels . interestingly, in the fresh samples, the ip <dig> level in b <dig> was slightly lower than that in qi <dig>  despite b <dig> being a high-phytic-acid content line. ip <dig> was detected in all embryos but its levels were significantly lower at 21dap in b <dig> and qi <dig> , which may be related to the abundances of ip <dig> and ip <dig> fig.  <dig> relative abundance of ip <dig> , ip <dig>  and ip <dig>  in the embryo and whole kernels of b <dig> and qi <dig>  dap: days after pollination. e/w, ratio of ip content in the embryo  versus that in the whole kernel . e/w >  <dig> indicates that the ip is mainly accumulated in the embryo

in summary, our data showed that ips accumulated mainly in embryos, and the fact that ip <dig> and ip <dig> were not detected before 21dap in whole seeds  suggests that phytic acid was synthesized sequentially in the embryo, and that the stages of ip synthesis are associated with different developmental stages of the embryo. in maize, the compartment in which phytic acid is synthesized has been reported  <cit> , however, our data confirmed that, at the metabolite level, ip <dig> accumulates mainly in the embryo.

taking into consideration the abundance and distribution of each ip, these results indicated clear sampling points for rna-seq analysis. we therefore subjected embryos of b <dig> and qi <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig> and 30dap to rna-seq and microrna-seq analyses to explore the regulation of ip metabolism. data-mining workflows are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

transcriptome analysis of b <dig> and qi319
alternative splicing and differentially expressed gene  analysis
to further understand the regulation of ip metabolism, we performed rna-seq analyses of maize embryos at different developmental stages. to verify that the gene expression patterns were consistent with previous reports, we determined the expression levels of three known genes—mik   <cit> , itpk- <dig>   <cit>  and abc transporter   <cit> —by qrt-pcr . mik expression in qi <dig> peaked at about 21dap, similar to the findings of shi et al.  <cit> . in contrast, mik expression in b <dig> declined continuously. the expression levels of itpk- <dig> and abc transporter were similar to that of mik, but exhibited different expression patterns. moreover, the greater expression of the three genes in b <dig> at 12dap is likely related to the earlier detection of ip <dig> .

alternative splicing  plays important roles in gene functions  <cit>  and is the main source of protein diversity  <cit> . for instance, oslpa <dig> has three splices in rice, but only the longest transcript is responsible for the phytic acid content of seeds  <cit> . ip metabolism genes also have specific as modes . the gene encoding inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate 5-phosphatase   has splice sites at the first exon  and the last exon . this as mode was present in b <dig> but not in qi <dig>  in b <dig>  itpk- <dig>  exhibited two variants: 3' alternative splicing  and exon skipping  at  <dig> and 30dap, while at 21dap, only 3as was present. interestingly, only 3as of itpk- <dig> was detected by rna-seq at 30dap in qi <dig>  therefore, the variation in as modes observed among the inbred lines at different developmental stages is likely related to the metabolic differences between b <dig> and qi <dig> .

the different abundances of each ip among plant tissues would be due to differences in the expression levels of the corresponding genes. to gain an increased understanding of the differences in ip metabolism, we compared gene expression levels between the b <dig> and qi <dig> lines. genes with fold changes  >  <dig> and fdr <  <dig>  were considered to be degs.

in general, a greater number of degs was found among the genetic backgrounds, rather than the developmental stages. in total,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the embryos at all time points . gene ontology  annotations of the degs indicated that they were enriched in the “metabolic process”, “binding”, “catalytic activity” and “transporter activity” categories . cluster of orthologous groups of proteins  annotation showed that ~ <dig> degs were enriched in the “carbohydrate transport and metabolism”, “transcription” and “signal transduction mechanism” categories .

we also mapped the degs to kegg pathways  . mips and itpk- <dig> were differentially expressed in qi <dig> and b <dig> at all time points. mips  catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate  to myo-inositol 3-phosphate , the first step in ip synthesis . the differential expression of mips implied that the metabolic differences between b <dig> and qi <dig> began at the first step of ip synthesis. itpk- <dig> catalyzes the conversion of ip <dig> to ip <dig> and was upregulated at 12dap but downregulated at 21dap and 30dap in b <dig> , which was consistent with the qrt-pcr results . this expression pattern was likely related to the appearance of ip <dig> in the embryo . in addition, some inositol transporter genes and inositol triphosphate 5-phosphase genes were also differentially expressed in b <dig> and qi <dig> .

differentially expressed transcription factors and micrornas
to our knowledge, no transcription factors  involved in the regulation of ip metabolism have been reported to date. we extracted  <dig> tf genes from the degs , including  <dig> novel assembled genes.

some of the differentially expressed tfs were consistently up- or down-regulated in b <dig> or differentially expressed at different developmental stages . those tfs were enriched in four families according to their molecular functions —wrky, myb, bhlh and ethylene-responsive tfs. wrky family genes are actively involved in abiotic/biotic stress and hormone responses, e.g., gibberellic acid, ga  <cit>  and ~ <dig> wrky genes were persistently differentially expressed during all developmental stages assessed in this study. myb and bhlh domain-containing tfs are associated with the regulation of plant development, the stress response, and temporal regulation of gene expression  <cit> . twenty myb genes were sustainably differentially expressed. ethylene-responsive tfs are involved in primary and secondary metabolite regulation, and were  differentially expressed mainly at 12dap . these results provide resources for further research into ip related tfs.

microrna-seq analyses showed that five differentially expressed micrornas in b <dig> and qi <dig> targeted ip-related genes . three of these candidate micrornas had predicted stem-loop structures, and their expression tended to be negatively correlated  with that of their target genes .table  <dig> candidate micrornas and their predicted target genes



weighted gene co-expression network construction and analysis
the abundance of each ip in b <dig> and qi <dig> embryos showed similar patterns with the expression of known genes . to explore the regulation of ip metabolism and discover new genes involved in ips, we first constructed gene co-expression networks weighted with metabolite data . ultimately, six ip-related gene co-regulation modules  were extracted from the whole transcriptome , three of which  were subjected to further analysis. the networks were compressed using the power graph method  <cit> , cutting nodes with low connectivity and merging the shared edges to form power edges. the compressed ratio of each network ranged from  <dig> to 92 % . the networks were decoded based on guide-genes and metadata analyses using plugins embedded in cytoscape .table  <dig> gene co-expression modules related to each inositol phosphate



nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase gene co-regulated with itpk in the “magenta2” network
itpk- <dig> was co-expressed with the nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase  gene , metal-binding protein gene , udp-glycosyltransferase gene , and a vq-motif   <cit>  -containing protein gene  in the “magenta2” network, which was negatively correlated with ip <dig>  and ip <dig> . as described above, the correlation of itpk- <dig> with the vq-coding gene suggested a mechanism by which wrky tfs regulate the expression of genes related to ip metabolism.fig.  <dig> sub-networks of “magenta2”. a sub-network  <dig> of “magenta2”. b sub-network  <dig> of “magenta2”. thick circles are power nodes and genes in green circles are connected to each other; thick lines are power edges, and the fine gray lines are common edges. red, nodes related to inositol phosphate or possible candidate genes; green diamonds, transcription factors; violet nodes, other inositol phosphate-related genes; and blue nodes, other genes without direct inositol phosphate-related annotation. the sub-networks were manually redrawn to clarify the nodes and edges. the original network and node annotations are shown in additional file 4




nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase consumes or produces nadh and functions as a key enzyme in oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain  <cit> . the relationships between ip metabolism and nadh have not been discussed previously. although it is known that nadh is required for catalysis by mips of glucose 6-phosphate to form inositol monophosphate  <cit> , why the expression of itpk- <dig> and ip4/ip <dig> was correlated with that of the nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase gene is unclear. the ip <dig> receptor interacted with nadh to release ca2+  <cit> , and voronina et al. reported that the nadh level was related to ca2+ signaling  <cit> , which was directly modulated by the nad+/nadh redox state  <cit> . therefore, the correlation of itpk- <dig> expression with that of the nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase gene essentially reflects the co-regulation of redox homeostasis  and ca2+ signaling, and implies that sequential changes in ip <dig> levels will in turn affect ip metabolism.

interaction of the gibberellic acid signaling pathway with ip metabolism in the “magenta2” network
we extracted another sub-network from “magenta2” using a gene  annotated as “1-phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate phosphodiesterase”  as a guide-gene . this network overlapped through four nodes  with the first sub-network mentioned above .

phospholipase c  is involved in ca2+ signal transduction  <cit>  and ip metabolism  <cit>  by releasing ip <dig> from phosphatidylinositol. the plc gene was correlated with node me <dig> , which was also correlated with itpk- <dig> . this indirect interaction is consistent with the roles of plc and itpk- <dig> in ip metabolism.

f-box protein and metal ion transporter genes lie in the regulation center between the plc gene and the p-loop–containing protein gene . some small molecules, e.g., auxin, can bind to f-box protein and mediate ubiquitination to regulate protein function at the posttranslational level  <cit> . interestingly, two gibberellic acid -related genes, i.e., node mc <dig>  and md <dig> , were also in contact with node mf <dig> by sharing the mb <dig>  me <dig>  and mj <dig> nodes, which were also in contact with the plc gene .

the finding that the plc gene shared nodes with ga-related genes is noteworthy. metadata analyses showed that the ga signaling pathway has biological relationships with inositol phosphates. ip <dig> is hydrolyzed by phytase in the presence of ga during seed germination  <cit> , and some lpa mutant crop lines show a reduced germination phenotype  <cit> . murthy et al.  <cit>  found that phosphatidylinositol metabolism was altered by ga in the aleurone layer of barley. microarray data analysis showed that ip metabolism genes also responded to ga and aba induction in rice  <cit> . fleet et al.  <cit>  reported that arabidopsis 5ptase mutants were hypersensitive to paclobutrazol , suggesting a relationship between elevated ip <dig> levels and decreased ga signal transduction. therefore, rather than a direct interaction, it is reasonable that ga-related genes and ip-related genes were co-regulated by nodes mb <dig> , me <dig>  and mj <dig>  in this sub-network. thus, this network predicts the potential mechanism and key nodes of the interactions between ips and ga.

several other genes also contacted the guide gene by sharing nodes mb <dig> and me <dig>  including a p-loop containing  protein-coding gene . a p-loop domain is also present in the lpa <dig> abc transporter  <cit> . node mf <dig>  is another p-loop-containing protein-coding gene, which was further from the guide gene compared with node mf <dig>  therefore, we selected mf <dig> as the first candidate gene involved in ip metabolism. mf <dig> likely encodes an enzyme because it lacks a predicted transmembrane domain but contains an atpase domain .

carbohydrate-related transporter genes in the “cornsilk” network
the “cornsilk” network was correlated with both ip <dig>  and ip <dig> . interestingly, many transporter genes  and transcription factor genes  were in this network .fig.  <dig> sub-network of “cornsilk”. all symbols are as in fig.  <dig>  except that violet nodes indicate transporter-related genes. the original network is shown in additional file 5




unexpectedly, the multidrug resistance-associated atp-binding cassette  transporter gene   <cit>  was not in this network, despite its similar expression pattern to those of itpk- <dig> and mik. many identified abc transporters are multi-role and have various substrates, including lipids, aba, and other hormones . the low-phytic-acid phenotype of lpa <dig> mutants or transgenic lines in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and soybean  <cit>  suggest that other unknown transporters are also responsible for ip transport between cells or organs. this may explain the lack of a correlation between zmmrp <dig> expression and ip <dig> level.

most transporter genes in this network were related to carbohydrate metabolism. representative genes include a udp-galactose transporter , carbohydrate/inositol-transporters , and a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter .

the correlation between ip <dig> levels and the expression of carbohydrate transporters  would imply some interesting biological relationships. metabolite profiling of rice showed that galactose and galactinol levels were increased in lpa mutant lines  <cit> . in fact, mips consumes glucose 6-phosphate and nadph to generate inositol monophosphate, producing udp-glucose as a by-product. udp-glucose is then converted into udp-galactose. therefore, the correlation between ips and udp-transporters would indicate the presence of metabolic cooperativity between ips and udp-galactose. ip <dig>  or possibly other ips, affects carbohydrate metabolism and composition by an unclear mechanism, e.g., several lpa mutants of maize exhibited decreased starch content  <cit> . in a study of the pleiotropic effects in the lpa <dig> mutant, neither the total starch content nor the amylose/amylopectin ratio was altered, but the structure and size of granules differed from those in the wild type  <cit> . thus this network illustrates the possible interactions between ips and carbohydrate metabolism.

raboy hypothesized that ion transporters are involved in ip <dig> transport to vesicles  <cit> . indeed, an h+ transporter gene  was also identified in this network. lemtiri-chlieh et al. found that aba increased ip <dig> levels, and that ip <dig> was a potent ca2+-dependent inhibitor of k+ traffic into guard cells  <cit> . ip <dig> accumulated mainly in vacuoles and its accumulation was enhanced when cells were grown in the presence of high concentrations of inorganic phosphates containing k+, ca2+, or zn2+  <cit> . h+-transporters are a type of h+-translocating pyrophosphatase. takasu et al. found that ip <dig> could directly interact with and inhibit h+-pyrophosphatase activity  <cit> . the h+-transporter  was likely involved in the translocation of ip <dig> into vesicles and therefore cb <dig> was selected as a candidate gene for further study.

specific abc transporters and ip compartmentation
ip <dig> was correlated with the “dodgerblue4” network , which contained the myo-inositol kinase  gene  . similar to the “magenta2” network, mik expression was correlated with that of an ubiquitin-related gene . this implies that the protein ubiquitination pathway plays an important role in the regulation of ip metabolism. two abc transporter family genes  were also correlated with a ubiquitin-related gene . the interaction between db <dig> with the two abc transporters  and mik  supports the hypothesis that specific transporters are responsible for the transport of inositol or inositol monophosphate to the embryo from other organs  <cit> . in bacteria, some abc transporters bind specifically to inositol  <cit> . a soybean mrp <dig> mutant exhibited reduced seed inositol levels and altered aba sensitivity. moreover, its mrp <dig> paralog was unable to complement the mutant phenotype  <cit> . this suggests that abc transporters play multiple roles and that specific abc transporters are responsible for inositol/inositol phosphate transport.fig.  <dig> sub-networks of “dodgerblue4”. a sub-network 1 of "dodgerblue4". b sub-network 2 of "dodgerblue4". the nodes indicated by green circles are abc transporter genes and the node in dark blue is the oslpa1-like gene. other symbols are as in fig.  <dig>  the original network is shown in additional file 6




the purple acid phosphatase -like gene  was co-expressed with the oslpa1-like gene  and an abc transporter-like gene . pap is an acid phosphatase with phytase activity  <cit> . overexpression of the pap gene in arabidopsis activated ca2+ signaling  <cit> , indicating a relationship between pap and ip metabolism. thus, the correlation between node dh <dig> with oslpa1-like  and pap  was notable. moreover, node dh <dig> was also in contact with an ethylene-responsive transcription factor , which was in turn in contact with two ip-related genes . therefore, node dh <dig>  was selected as a candidate gene for further study to confirm whether it is involved in ip transport.

interestingly, similar to the “magenta2” network, a ga-related gene  was directly/indirectly in contact with that of a type c abc transporter gene , a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase gene , and an abc transporter 5-like  gene . this suggested an interaction of ip metabolism or ca2+ signaling with the ga pathway.

validation of the candidate genes
to assess the network, we selected three candidate genes for further validation. we use node names to represent each candidate gene . according to the network information, we predicted that gene mf <dig> from “magenta2” would be involved in ip metabolism as an enzyme, gene dh <dig> from “dogerblue4” would be responsible for ip transport across organs, and gene cb <dig> from “cornsilk” would be related to ip co-transport into vesicles.table  <dig> candidate genes selected from the gene co-expression networks

we analyzed the expression profiles of the three candidate genes in maize embryo . the mf <dig> and dh <dig> genes showed expression patterns similar to those of itpk- <dig> and mik, respectively. gfp-fused transient transformation in maize protoplasts showed that mf <dig> was expressed in the cytoplasm, dh <dig> in the plasma membrane, and cb <dig> in vesicles, which is consistent with their expected molecular functions .fig.  <dig> transient transformation of maize protoplasts with gfp-fusion constructs. bar = 10 μm. three candidate genes: mf <dig>  grmzm2g123544; dh <dig>  grmzm5g874955; cb <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  gfp: prtl <dig> vector



to further validate the function of each candidate gene, we obtained t-dna insertion mutant lines of arabidopsis orthologs of dh <dig>  and cb <dig>  . ip metabolism was found to be perturbed in these two arabidopsis insertion lines, levels of almost all ips—with the exception of ip3—were decreased in both mutant lines . the ip <dig> level was significantly decreased in salk_ <dig>  and salk_ <dig>  compared with in clo- <dig>  interestingly, the ip <dig> level in salk_ <dig> was similar to that in clo- <dig>  but was decreased by ~23 % in salk_ <dig>  these differences in the ip levels in insertion lines suggest that the dh <dig> and cb <dig> genes play different roles in ip metabolism. taken together with the gfp-fused transient transformation data, these results suggest that dh <dig> and cb <dig> participate in ip transport across organs and co-transport into vesicles, respectively.fig.  <dig> inositol phosphate levels in seeds of arabidopsis t-dna insertion lines. bar represents the standard error. at least three individuals from each insertion line were used for ip determination. differences in the mean levels of ip in clo- <dig>  salk_ <dig> and salk_ <dig> were tested using one-way anova. significant differences were labelled as “a”, “b” and “c” . lines without significant differences were labelled with the same alphabet or unlabelled. hm: homozygote



to validate the function of mf <dig>  we ligated an mf <dig> cdna segment into pcambia <dig> with a ubiquitin  promoter. the transcript produced from the segment formed a hairpin structure . the construct was transformed into maize to produce mf3-knockdown lines , and the ip levels in the knockdown lines were then determined . results showed that, the expression level of mf <dig> in the transgenic lines was reduced approximately three- to five-fold compared with the segregated negative transgenic lines. the ip <dig> level increased almost two-fold in the rnai transgenic lines, but the ip <dig> level showed no significant difference. however, the levels of ip3–ip <dig> decreased significantly in the rnai lines. that of ip <dig> decreased ~30 % compared to the transgenic negative lines. taken together with the gfp-fused transient transformation results, the findings suggest that the product of the mf <dig> gene functions as an enzyme in ip metabolism.fig.  <dig> inositol phosphate levels in maize rnai lines. a rt-pcr of mf <dig> in maize rnai lines. e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  different transgenic events/lines; wt, wild-type, negative lines segregated from transgenic lines; gapdh, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene . b ip levels in seeds of maize transgenic lines. e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> represent rnai transgenic lines. **, significant differences between e <dig>  e <dig> or e <dig> and wt  were determined using student’s t-test 



CONCLUSIONS
to explore the regulatory mechanism of ip metabolism, we screened two inbred lines with significantly different ip <dig> levels  from a maize germplasm collection and carried out rna-seq and microrna-seq analyses.

transcriptome analyses showed that ipk/itpk expression was upregulated at 12dap in b <dig> compared with qi <dig>  while most known genes were downregulated in b <dig> after 12dap. however, mips and itpk showed continuously different expression patterns between the two lines. the differences in gene expression patterns were related to the abundance of ips  in embryos, suggesting a different pattern of ip metabolism regulation between the b <dig> and qi <dig> inbred lines.

several transcription factors, especially wrky and ethylene-responsive transcription factors, would be involved in the regulation of ip metabolism. moreover, three micrornas, which would be involved in ip metabolism regulation were identified. these findings will facilitate further research into ip metabolism.

to assess the implications of our data, six co-regulated networks were constructed. these networks have the potential to uncover the function and mechanism of regulation of ip metabolism.

the networks suggest ca2+ as the bridge and core node between ip metabolism and other pathways, and inositol-phosphate-related genes were linked with ga-related genes through ubiquitin-related genes or specific transporter genes . this information will facilitate investigation of the interactions of ips with ga. we also inferred several carbohydrate/inositol transporters and specific abc transporters as responsible for inositol or ip transport across organs.

three new candidate genes were extracted from the networks and validated experimentally. gene mutations in arabidopsis and gene knockdown in maize showed that the candidate genes were indeed involved in ip metabolism. the mf <dig> gene  encodes an enzyme, dh <dig>  encodes an abc transporter responsible for cross-organ transport of ip, and the product of the cb <dig> gene  is related to the co-transport of ip into vesicles.
