BACKGROUND
b cells synthesize and secrete large quantities of soluble immunoglobulin antibodies and thus, play a key role in humoral immunity. an infection with the epstein-barr virus  easily transforms resting primary b cells in vitro from human peripheral blood cells into b-blast-like proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines   <cit> . this infection is used routinely in the laboratory to generate lcls from b cells  <cit> . lcls are widely used in various types of studies, including those involving the disciplines of immunology, cellular biology, and genetics. this transformation results in changes in certain cellular properties, including gene expression  <cit> , cell surface phenotyping, and cytokine production  <cit> .

extracellular nucleotides – e.g., adenosine 5'-triphosphate , adenosine 5'-diphosphate, uracil 5'-triphosphate, and uracil 5'-diphosphate – have various physiological effects in many cells, such as exocrine and endocrine secretion, neurotransmission, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and programmed cell death that are mediated by p <dig> receptors, consisting of p2x and p2y receptors  <cit> . p2x receptors are ligand-gated cation channels, of which seven receptor subtypes  have been identified and cloned  <cit> . p2y receptors, which are g-protein-coupled metabotropic structures, consist of eight cloned and functionally distinct subtypes: p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig>  <cit> .

blood cells express p <dig> receptors which regulate such responses as cell proliferation, differentiation, chemotaxis, cytokine release, immune and inflammatory responses  <cit> . in lymphocytes, atp induces an increase in membrane permeability for cations and larger molecules  <cit> , as well as cellular proliferation  <cit>  and cell death through p <dig> receptors  <cit> . the precise nature of the expression and function of the p <dig> receptor subtypes have been investigated  <cit> .

p <dig> receptors expressed in b cells have been investigated using electrophysiological, pharmacological, and immunocytochemical techniques, which have revealed the existence of p <dig> receptors  <cit> , especially p2x  <cit> . however, the researchers in these studies failed to perform a quantitative analysis of p <dig> mrna and used b cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or lcls, rather than pure b cells. recently, the mrna profile of the lymphocyte p <dig> receptor was subjected to quantitative analysis, but the b cells were not separated and not all subtypes were targeted  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the expression of p <dig> receptors in human b cells and in lcls using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction , western blotting, and fluorimetric techniques to measure intracellular free ca2+ concentration . we were able to determine the profile of the p <dig> receptor mrna in these cells and monitor changes in i in response to p <dig> receptor activation. our findings indicate the plasticity of p <dig> receptors in b cells during their transformation into lcls.

RESULTS
igd and cd <dig> are cell-surface molecules that have been used widely to identify the b-cell phenotype during b-cell development. like germinal center b cells, most ebv-transformed b cells were positive for cd <dig> but not for igd  <cit> . the expression of igd and cd <dig> molecules on primary b cells and ebv-transformed lcls was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter  analysis. to generate lcls, we cultured isolated b cells with the active ebv supernatant for  <dig> to  <dig> weeks, as described in methods section. the primary b cells expressed igd, but not cd <dig>  and the lcls expressed cd <dig>  but not igd . this result is consistent with our previous findings  <cit> .

p <dig> receptor mrna quantification
the expression of p <dig> receptors in b cells and lcls was determined using quantitative rt-pcr. the expression of the p <dig> receptor subtypes was compared among b cells, lcls, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells . p2x <dig> or p2y <dig> were used as a calibrator  in order to illustrate the expression of p <dig> receptors relative to each other. all p2x and p2y receptor subtypes were detected in the b cells. most of the p <dig> receptor subtypes had similar rates of expression within 1- or 2-fold of each other with the exception of the p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors, which were expressed in lower quantities . p2x <dig> receptor expression was significantly low compared to other p2x receptors , with the exception of p2x <dig>  the presence of p2x- and p2y-receptor mrna in the b cells is in agreement with the findings of previous lymphocyte studies using rt-pcr  <cit> . ebv-infected b cells were also examined because an in vitro transformation might alter the expression of receptors. the most abundant p <dig> receptor subtypes were p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  and p2y <dig> . the expression of p2x <dig> receptors in lcls was significantly higher than other p2x receptors . the p <dig> receptors in b cells were compared with those expressed in lcls . the expression of the p2x <dig> through to p2x <dig> receptors and p2y receptors in lcls and b cells that had been infected with ebv for  <dig> weeks was significantly lower than in noninfected b cells . however, the lcls expressed a significantly larger number of p2x <dig> receptors than b cells . the expression of ebv-infected lcls, which had been infected for more than  <dig> weeks and ebv-infected b cells, which had been infected for  <dig> weeks, yielded similar profiles and quantities. as a control, p <dig> receptors in pbmcs were quantified and these showed a different expression profile. in pbmcs, which are mainly monocytes and lymphocytes, p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> were the predominant p <dig> receptor subtypes , and the expression rates for p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> were significantly higher than other p2x or p2y subtypes . in addition, p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> expression was significantly higher in pbmcs compared with b cells , which may be the result of t cell/monocyte contamination in the pbmc preparation  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulated p2x <dig> receptor can be expected to have a physiological role during the transformation of b cells into lcls.

western blotting for p <dig> receptors
to investigate the correlation of mrna with protein, we carried out western blot analysis for p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors, all of which had varying amounts of mrna during ebv transformation . the distribution of p <dig> receptors in b cells and lcls is shown on the left panel . the bands representing p2x <dig> , p2x <dig> , p2y <dig> , and p2y <dig>  receptors were more prominent in b cells than in lcls, which correlates with the results of the mrna quantitative analysis. as for the p2x <dig> receptor, it was represented by a prominent 68-kda band in lcls and a faint band in b cells. this is consistent with the results of rt-pcr, which indicated that the expression of p2x <dig> is higher in lcls than in b cells. to compare protein loading, the blot was re-probed with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  antibody  .

effect of atp on intracellular free ca2+ concentration
extracellular atp is an effective modulator of i, and its activities are mediated through p <dig> receptors  <cit> . to determine whether the p <dig> receptors examined by rt-pcr and western blotting were functional, we carried out digital fluorescence imaging of the ca2+-sensitive dye fura 2-am and compared the images seen following atp-induced changes in i in b cells and lcls. in the presence of  <dig> mm ca2+ and  <dig> mm atp, we observed an average increase in i from  <dig>  to  <dig>   in b cells and lcls  . the i increased with atp in a dose-dependent manner  , indicating that the potency of atp was similar in both cells. the mechanism leading to the intracellular ca2+ response was examined further by repeating these experiments under ca2+-free conditions. the b cells were treated with  <dig> mm atp under ca2+-free conditions, and the i remained at or near the pre-agonist levels . the peak i was mostly abolished in b cells  and in lcls  in the absence of ca2+ . these data suggest that an influx of ca2+ is the major route by which b cells and lcls respond to atp stimulation.

discussion
in this study, we determined and compared mrna expression levels for all known p2x and p2y receptor subtypes on human b cells and lcls. quantitative rt-pcr was used to determine the gene expression profile for p <dig> receptors. this method was selected because selective agonists and antagonists for most of the p <dig> receptor subtypes are absent and real-time pcr has advantages over other methods, such as requiring only a small number of cells and being one of the most reliable methods of determining the amount of rna.

this is the first study to show the expression of p <dig> receptors using mrna from healthy human b cells. in these cells, most of the p2x and p2y receptor subtypes had 2-fold expression with the exception of p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors. in the studies of the p2x receptor, the p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  and p2x <dig> receptors were found in human b cells by an immunocytochemical assay  <cit>  and the non-desensitizing cation channels activated by atp, which is a feature of p2x <dig> receptor, were measured using electrophysiological methods  <cit> . the different results of p2x subtype expression might be due to the different b cells, or variations in p2x receptor expression  <cit> . b cells transformed by ebv  <cit>  or malignant b cells  <cit>  were used in previous studies, while normal b cells were used in the present study. in addition, it is possible that there might be differences in the transcription, translation, and function of p2x receptors. the different p2x <dig> expression levels may be because p2x <dig> receptor might be up-regulated in clls  <cit>  and that some lymphoid cells do not express p2x <dig> receptor  <cit> . in addition, b cells did not undergo the typical increase in membrane permeability to atp and were not susceptible to atp-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . although the p2y receptors in b cells were investigated, it was not enough to compare the expression of subtypes. p2y subtypes were detected by rt-pcr in previous studies, albeit only in lymphocytes  <cit> .

in lcls and b cells infected by ebv for  <dig> weeks, the predominant p <dig> receptor subtypes were p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  and p2y <dig>  the expression of most p <dig> receptors was suppressed during the ebv-induced b-cell transformation into lcls, however, the suppression of p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors was not as great as for other subtypes. only p2x <dig> receptor was significantly up-regulated. western blotting showed similar patterns for p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig>  as well as for p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> . our results suggest that there is some plasticity in p2-receptor expression in b cells. this possibility has been investigated in many tissues and cells, including the urinary bladder, heart, vessels, gut, neurons, and cancer cells  <cit> . in immune cells, plasticity in p2y2-receptor expression was studied during myeloid leukocyte differentiation  <cit> . sensitivity to atp in thymocytes changes with the stage of maturation  <cit> , and p2x7-receptor expression can be modulated by diverse stimuli  <cit> . the plasticity of p <dig> receptors may be due to changes in their exposure to atp or ebv-induced changes in gene expression. in vivo, atp is often released by blood cells into the extracellular environment through nonlytic mechanisms. some leakage of cytoplasmic atp may also occur as a consequence of damage to the cell or acute cell death. platelet-dense granules comprise another relevant source of atp  <cit> . in vitro, however, the sources of atp for b cells are limited to nonlytic mechanisms or leakage of cytoplasmic atp. the ebv-induced transformation of b cells into lcls results in some b cells dying, which results in atp being released into the extracellular compartment, where it continually degrades. thus, the concentration of atp may be high in the early stages of in vitro transformation and lower in later stages. the expression of p <dig> receptors may be affected by this fluctuation in environmental atp.

in pbmc populations that include lymphocytes and monocytes, the dominant p <dig> receptor subtypes were p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig>  an mrna expression assay revealed that the p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors were expressed in lymphocytes and monocytes and that the p2y <dig> receptor was expressed in relatively higher amounts than the other p2y receptor subtypes  <cit> . p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors were expressed in relatively large amounts in lymphocytes and p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors in monocytes  <cit> . the expression of p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors correlated with the findings of previous studies; however, the expression of the p2y <dig> receptor was somewhat different. it is possible that other lymphocytes or monocytes expressed these subtypes predominantly. alternatively this may reflect a variation in cohorts or contamination with other types of blood cells. to date, these blood cells have not been investigated well enough to compare p <dig> receptor subtypes, although some of them have been surveyed  <cit> . because the p <dig> receptor profiles of blood cells are not completely known, it is difficult to determine which p <dig> receptor subtypes have been expressed dominantly in pbmcs until now.

although the p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors were examined with other subtypes, the findings for these subtypes were omitted because they are not included among the classical p2y receptor subtypes in humans. we found the mrna for these subtypes in b cells, lcls, and pbmcs, indicating that they are prominent in these cells. in previous studies of human p <dig> receptors, the p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors were expressed in hl <dig>  <cit>  and included in the human genome  <cit> . the national center for biotechnology information  confirmed the gene sequence for each of these receptors . a physiological role for the p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors in b cells and in human blood cells can therefore be expected.

atp-stimulated p <dig> receptors increased the i in b cells and lcls, albeit rather slowly. this was quite a different effect from that of other stimuli, such as the anti-igm antibody, which caused i levels to change rapidly  <cit> . this might be due to differences in ca2+ signaling or the temperature at which the experiments were conducted, which might influence the kinetics involved when the i changes. extracellular ca2+-free conditions prevented the i from increasing, thereby indicating that the main cause of the increase in i might be an atp-induced influx of ca2+, although the possibility that mobilization of stored ca2+ may be involved should probably also be considered. the increased i might be largely due to p2x receptor activity, because it was mediated by an influx of ca2+, which is the major effect of activating p2x receptors. the results of real-time pcr indicated a decrease in p <dig> receptors and those of western blotting demonstrated a similar pattern for several p <dig> receptors, even when the up-regulation of p2x <dig> receptor was considered. however, the increase in i by atp was a little higher in lcls than in b cells, which was not statistically significant. ebv-transformed b cells might enhance the availability of ca2+, thereby causing i to rise, even when p <dig> receptors are down-regulated. the response to extracellular atp is an increase in i in b cells as well as in lcls, which are probably derived from ebv-infected b cell lymphoma in vivo. this may cause a variety of cellular events, ranging from transcriptional regulation to cell migration and proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the expression of p2x and p2y receptors in human b cells and lcls was investigated. p2-receptor expression was suppressed during the ebv-induced transformation of b cells, except for the p2x <dig> subtype, which was up-regulated. extracellular atp induced an increase in i in b cells and lcls via p <dig> receptors. therefore, these findings reveal the exact p <dig> receptor profiles and the effects of purinergic stimuli on b cells and suggest some plasticity in the expression of the p <dig> receptor phenotype. this will help us explain the nature and effect of p <dig> receptors on b cells and their role in altering the characteristics of lcls.
