BACKGROUND
qki was recently proposed as a candidate gene for schizophrenia based on linkage, association and mrna expression studies  <cit> . the alteration of expression levels involves differential expression of splice variants. an earlier study showed decreased expression levels of qki splice variant seven  in frontal cortex of schizophrenia patients  <cit> . qki controls expression of oligodendrocyte related  genes, as reviewed previously  <cit> , and expression of or genes has clearly been shown to be altered in schizophrenia  <cit> . furthermore, qki expression was recently shown to be both necessary and sufficient to promote myelination of oligodendrocytes  <cit> . astrocytes also play a role in myelination by mediating communication between axons and myelinating glial cells  <cit>  and it has been suggested that these two cell types are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  <cit> .

interestingly, an association between the type of antipsychotic drugs patients received and qki mrna expression was shown previously  <cit> . we hypothesized that antipsychotic medication influences qki expression. to test this hypothesis we treated human oligodendroglioma  and astrocytoma  cell lines with five different antipsychotic drugs, at levels similar to clinical plasma concentrations  <cit> . we show that haloperidol stimulates qki- <dig> mrna expression selectively in u <dig> cells.

RESULTS
to test whether antipsychotic drugs affect qki mrna expression in u <dig> and hog cells, we treated cell cultures with aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine or risperidone for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. in u <dig> cells, the most significant change in mrna expression levels was a  <dig> -fold increase of qki- <dig>  after  <dig> hour treatment with haloperidol . at this concentration the effect appeared to be transient and expression levels in treated cells were similar to those in control cells after  <dig> hours. a slight decrease in mrna expression was also detected for qki- <dig> when the u <dig> cell line was treated with risperidone or clozapine . in hog cells, we only observed a slight increase of qki- <dig> mrna levels  in response to risperidone . the increase of qki- <dig> in the oligodendroglioma cell line by the atypical antipschotica risperidone does not reflect previous alterations observed in brains of patients  <cit> . however, it is important to remember that no patients are treated exclusively by risperidone. furthermore, changes detected in brain of patients are the result of drug effects on multiple cellular pathways and cannot directly be compared with in vitro effects on a single cell line. in any case, our current in vitro experiments and the previous analysis of post-mortem brains coincide in the suggestion of alterations in qki control in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after treatment with antypsychotic drugs

to further evaluate the effect of haloperidol on qki- <dig> mrna expression, we treated u <dig> cells with  <dig> times higher concentration  and observed a five-fold increase after  <dig> hours  and a three-fold increase after  <dig> hours  . antipsychotic drugs are known to bind to dopamine receptor  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  among other receptors. to evaluate whether dopamine receptors were present in the cells we measured mrna levels of both receptors in each cell line. we detected low levels of d2r mrna expression in both u <dig> and hog cells . d3r expression was not detected in either of the cell types .

discussion
a previous study showed that post-mortem samples from schizophrenia patients had different mrna levels of qki splice variants depending on the medication received by the patients  <cit> . however, it was not evaluated whether qki alterations were due to a direct or indirect effect on medication, and what cell type were involved. in this study, we show that treatment of a human astrocytoma cell line with the typical antipsychotic agent haloperidol results in alterations of qki expression levels. furthermore, this change was observed using a concentration similar to plasma levels detected in patients, suggesting the possibility that haloperidol affects astrocyte function.

the observed increase of qki- <dig> mrna expression is in agreement with previous findings by aberg et al., showing increased gene expression of qki in schizophrenic patients treated with typical antipsychotic agents  <cit> . a caveat to the interpretation to our results is that it is difficult to compare a transient increase of qki- <dig> in astrocytoma cells with effects in vivo after chronic treatment of patients with haloperidol and other drugs. however, our results indicate for the first time a link between haloperidol action and qki control within astrocytoma cells. these observations suggest a direct link between haloperidol and qki control in astrocytes, and they clearly indicate that the molecular pathway in which qki is involved, is affected during haloperidol action both in in vivo and in vitro experiments.

alteration of qki expression after haloperidol treatment has also been shown in mice  <cit> , but the direction of the change was the opposite. the most reasonable explanation to the differences between the studies is that naryan et al. worked with an in vivo model in mice whereas we worked with an in vitro model in humans. differences in cell types between the species, as well as the absence of in vitro models of neuronal circuits and inter-cellular relationships present in the living brain makes the results difficult to compare. in other words, naryan et al showed an effect of haloperidol on qki in mice neuronal networks while our study shows the individual effect of haloperidol on glial cell lines. however, both studies coincide in a relationship between haloperidol and qki pathways. the molecular and cellular details of this interaction remain to be elucidated.

previous studies found that dopamine receptors were expressed in primary astrocytic cultures  <cit> . we confirmed the expression of d2r in the u <dig> cells at the mrna level. in addition, d1r and d2r proteins were previously detected in human astrocytoma cell lines, as published in the human protein atlas . it is therefore possible that the increased expression of qki- <dig> is mediated by haloperidol binding to d2r. however, drug action through binding to other receptors cannot be excluded at this point. future binding studies will clarify this point. if antipsychotic drugs affect qki expression via binding to dopamine receptors, it would be expected that all drugs used in this study would affect qki levels. however, this was not the case and the most pronounced effect was observed with haloperidol. this does not exclude the possibility of d2r involvement since it is possible that haloperidol may occupy more d2r than other agents when low doses are used.

interestingly, when hog cells were treated with risperidone we observed a slight increase of qki- <dig> mrna levels. in u <dig> cells we did not detect an effect on qki- <dig>  instead, we found a decrease of qki- <dig> mrna expression. risperidone appears to have different effect on qki in hog cells and astrocytic cells, although the change in gene expression was not as pronounced as when haloperidol was used.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results suggest a direct effect of haloperidol treatment on qki mrna expression in astrocytes. a smaller effect on qki expression was also detected when the cells were treated with risperidone. the physiological effect of these changes on the symptoms of the patients, and the normal function of qki in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes remain to be investigated. this knowledge could contribute to understand the molecular mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs after binding to receptors, and it may also help to find new and better drug targets for the disease.
