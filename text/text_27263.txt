BACKGROUND
enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner is essential for future agriculture. genetic improvement of crop plants relies on the cultivation of genotypes that possess favourable alleles/genes controlling desirable agronomic traits  <cit> . in the past, both early domestication and the more recent modern plant breeding have resulted in severe genetic bottlenecks, reducing the levels of genetic diversity  <cit> . as most of the modern genotypes cultivated today have descended from a relatively small number of landraces, the genes controlling important traits have reduced diversity compared to the gene pool of landraces and wild relatives. this is likely to make the modern varieties more vulnerable to newly emerging strains of pathogens. for example, the recent emergence of ug <dig> stem rust race is a potential threat to wheat production worldwide  <cit> . race ug <dig> is reported to possess a unique combination of virulences that renders over 90% of worlds' wheat cultivars and breeding materials susceptible to it  <cit> . in view of such threats of constant genetic erosion, gene banks have been established and maintained in order to mainly preserve wild plant accessions as well as landraces  <cit> . thus, gene bank collections represent very rich stocks of plant genetic diversity and can contribute significantly to the future genetic improvement of crops  <cit> . to use this valuable potential of genetic resources, allele mining has been suggested as an approach to identify allelic variation of relevant traits within the genetic resource collections  <cit> . this approach is best utilized for agronomically important genes with known dna sequence, which can then be used to develop appropriate molecular tools to find new alleles  <cit> .

wheat is an important food crop and its production is threatened by diseases caused mostly by fungal pathogens, including powdery mildew  <cit> . control of fungal diseases by chemicals is expensive and can have negative impacts on natural eco-systems whereas genetically based resistance offers efficient and ecologically sound control. resistance breeding requires constant efforts to enrich the reservoir of resistance genes in wheat. more than  <dig> powdery mildew resistance genes have been characterized in wheat  <cit> . however, pm <dig> is the only wheat powdery mildew resistance gene that has been cloned to date and is now known to occur in  <dig> functional allelic forms   <cit> . the pm <dig> gene is a distinct member of a large cluster of nbs-lrr genes on wheat chromosome 1a. the pm <dig> alleles confer race-specific resistance to blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, the wheat powdery mildew fungus  <cit> . eight of the  <dig> pm <dig> alleles  have been recently identified  <cit>  with pm3k being the only allele isolated from tetraploid wheat  <cit>  while all the other  <dig> functional pm <dig> alleles were isolated from hexaploid wheat  <cit> . the widespread susceptible allele pm3cs, which represents the consensus sequence of all the different pm <dig> resistance alleles, has been proposed to be the ancestor of the bread wheat pm <dig> resistance alleles  <cit> . the pm <dig> alleles and their flanking sequences were found to be highly conserved forming the specific pm <dig> haplotype  <cit> . this conservation allowed the isolation of pm3a to pm3g  <cit> , characterized in classical breeding, as well as new alleles  which were not previously characterized by classical genetics  <cit> .

the cloning of pm3l to pm3r  <cit>  has been the result of an allele mining study that led to a rapid isolation of these seven new functional alleles of pm <dig>  the choice of accessions for this study was made through focused identification of germplasm strategy   <cit> , where the eco-geographical data of powdery mildew resistant accessions was used as a reference dataset to formulate the working set of wheat landraces from environmentally similar collection sites to perform pm <dig> allele mining. this formulated working set consisted mainly of accessions that originated from turkey, iran, afghanistan, pakistan and armenia   <cit> . thus, the accessions previously studied for pm <dig> allelic diversity were obtained from a limited geographical region. the question remained if wheat lines originating from other regions of the world contain additional, new pm <dig> alleles and how such new alleles would compare to the known molecular diversity. in order to further assess the diversity at the pm <dig> locus in wheat accessions originating from geographically more diverse locations, here we established a set of  <dig> gene bank accessions. thus, we have expanded the search for new pm <dig> alleles in accessions representing  <dig> countries covering different continents of the world. this has led to isolation and cloning of new pm <dig> alleles and has shed light on the molecular diversity among pm <dig> alleles.

RESULTS
screening for powdery mildew resistant wheat accessions in gene bank material
a set of  <dig> wheat accessions was obtained from the gene bank of ipk, gatersleben . these accessions were selected based on their origin from different geographical regions worldwide, complementing the earlier studied figs set of wheat lines which originated mostly from the near and middle east  <cit> . the  <dig> accessions originated from asia, africa, europe, australia and the americas . the entire set of these accessions was phenotypically characterized for resistance against wheat powdery mildew by screening with a set of six powdery mildew isolates. the choice of the isolates was based on their avirulence and virulence patterns to the known alleles of pm <dig>  pm3a to pm3g. this screening led to the identification of  <dig> accessions  that were resistant or intermediately resistant to at least one of the six mildew isolates tested .

the entire set of  <dig> accessions obtained from ipk gene bank was subjected to a hierarchical selection procedure to select for the resistant accessions which were further analysed at the molecular level for the isolation of pm <dig> alleles.

pcr based characterization of pm <dig> in the resistant accessions
the  <dig> accessions with a resistant or intermediate resistant phenotype were subjected to molecular analysis for the pm <dig> haplotype. first, they were screened for the presence of a pm3-like gene with an sts marker obtained from haplotype studies at the pm <dig> locus  <cit> . this sts marker amplifies a  <dig> bp fragment from the 5' non-coding region of pm3b and is diagnostic for the presence of a pm3-like gene. a total of  <dig> accessions out of  <dig>  were identified with a likely presence of a pm <dig> gene . subsequently, the accessions showing the presence of a pm3-like gene were screened for the presence of the already known pm <dig> alleles, pm3a to pm3g, with allele specific molecular markers developed previously  <cit> . twenty-eight of these accessions were found to carry a known pm <dig> resistance allele. pm3c was the most frequently detected allele in this set , followed by pm3b in six accessions while pm3f, pm3e and pm3d were detected in two, two and one accessions each, respectively. this demonstrated that the alleles of pm <dig> in most of the tested accessions are not pm3a to pm3g resistance alleles and therefore, these accessions are good candidates for isolation of new pm <dig> alleles. however, these accessions were not screened for the presence of pm3k to pm3r, alleles for which functional molecular markers have not yet been developed. additionally, it cannot be ruled out that the observed resistance is caused by any of the known or still uncharacterized resistance genes present in the germplasm other than pm <dig> 

isolation of pm <dig> sequences from the candidate accessions
the phenotypic and genotypic experiments described above allowed us to establish a collection of  <dig> candidate lines with a resistant phenotype  to specifically target for isolation of new alleles of the pm <dig> gene . these candidate lines were completely resistant to at least one of the isolates tested, were identified to possess a pm3-like gene and lacked the known pm <dig> alleles pm3a to pm3g. the pm <dig> coding sequences were successfully amplified from  <dig> accessions, cloned and sequenced. in the remaining  <dig> accessions, amplification of a pm <dig> sequence was not possible which might be due to absence of a coding gene or low sequence homology at the primer binding sites. among the  <dig> amplified sequences, eight were identical to the susceptible pm3cs  <cit> , indicating that the observed resistance is not due to a pm <dig> gene but is caused by other known or still uncharacterized pm genes. eighteen of these total  <dig> sequences were identical to the previously reported susceptible pm3go/jho sequence identified from landraces of bhutan  <cit> . here, the pm3go/jho allele was identified in accessions originating from india , nepal  and china .

the analysis of sequence diversity in the cloned genes led to the identification of eight new pm <dig> allelic sequences, as several accessions possessed identical alleles . four of these new pm <dig> sequences  were isolated from six accessions that originated in nepal. three other pm <dig> alleles were isolated from accessions from ethiopia , china  and argentina , respectively . pm3_ <dig> was isolated from accessions with five very different origins i.e., sudan, argentina, ethiopia, mexico and iraq .

some pm <dig> alleles were identified in several accessions. the functional pm <dig> alleles are indicated in bold.

newly isolated pm <dig> alleles show overall high similarity to known pm <dig> alleles
the eight new pm <dig> alleles were compared to the  <dig> functional alleles of pm <dig> as well as pm3cs, the susceptible ancestral sequence  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> unique pm <dig> sequences that have been previously isolated both from tetraploid  and hexaploid wheat  were included in the comparisons  <cit> . none of these  <dig> alleles was found to impart resistance against the tested isolates  <cit> .

the dna sequence comparison of the eight new pm <dig> sequences to the already known pm <dig> alleles showed an overall high similarity. the pm3cs sequence was used as a reference sequence in the alignment . the new pm <dig> sequences also consist of two exons separated by an intron of  <dig> bp and encode resistance proteins with a very similar overall amino acid sequence. six of the eight newly isolated pm <dig> sequences are  <dig> bp long , the length corresponding to that of pm3cs. the pm3_ <dig> sequence is  <dig> bp long due to the presence of a  <dig> bp insertion in the region encoding lrr- <dig> of the gene. pm3_ <dig> consisted of  <dig> nucleotides and was the smallest sequence in length as it possesses a deletion spanning the last part of exon  <dig> and the beginning of the predicted intron. thus, it was not possible to assign exons and intron to this sequence and it possibly represents a pseudogene. the deletion found in pm3_ <dig> is identical to the one identified in the previously reported pseudogene fj <dig>  <cit> .

the coiled coil  encoding region of the new pm <dig> sequences is completely conserved. the nbs encoding region is conserved among the new pm <dig> alleles with the exception of two sequences . pm3_ <dig> bears three polymorphic bases in the nbs-encoding region which are shared with pm3a and pm3b, while pm3_ <dig> possesses two polymorphic bases unique to its sequence in this region. the interspacer region separating the nbs and the lrr encoding domains was also found to be conserved, except for pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig> that possess a highly polymorphic sequence block  and a single snp respectively, in this region. major sequence polymorphisms between the new sequences and the pm3cs consensus sequence were observed in the lrr-encoding region of the gene. these polymorphisms in the lrr region were either in the form of highly polymorphic sequence blocks or in the form of few snps per sequence. pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig> differ from pm3cs only by two and three snps, respectively, in the lrr encoding region . six of the eight new sequences  possess polymorphic sequence blocks in the lrr encoding region  in addition to the snps.

the polymorphic sequence block found in pm3_ <dig>  is identical to the one present in pm3m and pm3r  and spans the interspacer region and the lrr- <dig> encoding region. in case of pm3_ <dig>  pm3_ <dig>  pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig>  the polymorphic sequence blocks are only partially shared with other previously reported alleles. the block in pm3_ <dig>  consists of a total eleven nucleotide polymorphisms out of which seven are shared with pm3c. thus, pm3_ <dig> appears to be a chimera of pm3cs and pm3c . the pm3_ <dig> sequence shares polymorphic residues with pm3o  at five out of eight polymorphic sites building the block in pm3_ <dig> . the pm3_ <dig> sequence showed high similarity with the tetraploid alleles in terms of polymorphic residues , especially for the presence of highly polymorphic sequence block , typically found in tetraploid alleles. in addition, pm3_ <dig> shared  <dig> randomly distributed polymorphic sites out of a total of  <dig> sites building the block in pm3_ <dig>  with the tetraploid pm <dig> sequences between the nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig> . pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig> were the only two sequences found to share polymorphic sites with the pm <dig> alleles isolated from tetraploid wheat.

pm <dig> sequence diversity
the nucleotide diversity was analyzed for the coding sequence of  <dig> pm <dig> sequences that have been isolated so far , excluding the two pseudogene sequences  while including pm3cs and pm3go/jho. nucleotide diversity and ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes were calculated for the pm <dig> alleles isolated from hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, for each group separately as well as together. in addition, the sequence diversity was studied specifically for the coding sequences of the distinct pm <dig> protein domains . the nucleotide diversity was found to be higher in the interspacer and lrr regions for pm <dig> alleles isolated from both hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, compared to the diversity found in the cc and nbs domains . in the lrr and interspacer regions, polymorphic sequence blocks of various sizes were found between the analysed pm <dig> variants , contributing to high values of nucleotide diversity. the highest number of non-synonymous changes were found in the lrr encoding domain, resulting in a higher value for the ratio of ka/ks in this region .

nucleotide diversity was analyzed together as well as separately for pm <dig> alleles isolated from hexaploid and tetraploid wheat, respectively. the domain positions correspond to that of consensus sequence pm3cs and insertions/deletions were not counted as aligned sites. synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were determined by comparison of each codon in every sequence with the respective consensus sequence at that position. the number of polymorphic sites is lower than the sum of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions because of multiple different bases in some polymorphic sites.

the average number of nucleotide differences per  <dig> bp was highest in the interspacer coding region. however, this high value originates from the presence of polymorphic sequence blocks in some of the hexaploid  and tetraploid  pm <dig> alleles in this particular region. comparatively low values of nucleotide diversity and ka/ks ratio were obtained for the cc and nbs region coding regions. this is due to very few polymorphisms found in these regions.

sequence exchange with pm <dig> homologs
the entire set of  <dig> pm <dig> sequences  was compared to five pm3-homologous rgas  <cit>  sequenced from orthologous regions of three wheat species, i.e., t. monococcum , t. turgidum  and t. aestivum . these are most likely paralogous genes belonging to a large cluster. these pm3-like rgas were found be very polymorphic  as compared to the pm <dig> alleles , when aligned with pm3cs as a reference sequence. there were no obvious sequence blocks in the pm <dig> alleles that would have been derived from these pm3-like rgas, except for block a . block a spans the interspacer and the lrr- <dig> encoding regions and is found specifically in pm3_ <dig>  pm3m and pm3r. it shares  <dig> out of  <dig> polymorphic residues with tdrgl- <dig> from t. turgidum . the remaining five polymorphic sites at which block a and tdrgl- <dig> sequence were not identical are spread randomly over the length of the block. the presence of block a in alleles isolated from hexaploid wheat as well as in tdrgl- <dig> from t. turgidum indicates sequence exchange between the specific pm <dig> allele and a paralogous rga from the cluster.

functional validation of candidate pm <dig> alleles through transient transformation
the eight new pm <dig> sequences identified in this study were tested for function in a transient transformation assay  <cit> . transient transformation has previously been found to be an effective method to study powdery mildew resistance gene function in wheat  <cit> . the non-functional pm3cs allele  <cit>  was used as a control and it gave a high haustorium index . in contrast, the two new alleles i.e., pm3_ <dig> and pm3_  <dig> showed a significant reduction in the haustorium index , with  <dig> % and  <dig> % average values, respectively. transformation with the remaining six pm <dig> allelic sequences  did not result in a reduction of the haustorium index . to test race specific gene function of the two new alleles showing reduction in haustorium index , they were also tested against the powdery mildew isolate bgt  <dig> found to be virulent on accessions carrying these genes. in this case, no reduction of haustorium indices was observed compared to pm3cs , demonstrating that the observed resistance activity is due to race-specificity of gene action. in conclusion, the alleles pm3_ <dig> and pm3_  <dig> are new, functionally active forms of pm <dig> which are now called pm3s and pm3t, respectively. the alleles pm3s  and pm3t  were isolated from accessions that originated from china and nepal, respectively. the repertoire of functional pm <dig> alleles now includes  <dig> genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes.

discussion
gene bank accessions as source of genetic diversity for the pm <dig> gene
genetic diversity is highly relevant for improvement of crop traits by breeding. the widespread use of genetically uniform varieties provides an ideal genetic environment for disease epidemics; for example, the devastating  <dig> epidemic of corn leaf blight caused by the fungal pathogen bipolaris maydis happened due to widespread deployment of genetically uniform varieties  <cit> . crop genetic resources harbour a treasure of undiscovered allelic variants and thus provide an opportunity for genetic improvement of cultivated species. in the past, a large number of agronomically important genes, including disease resistance genes, were introgressed from wild relatives and landraces into the cultivated species. for example, the two very important wheat genes rht <dig> and rht <dig> providing the foundation for green revolution were introgressed from cultivar 'norin10' that originally inherited these genes from japanese landrace "shiro daruma"  <cit> .

previously, the approach to utilize gene bank accessions was mostly restricted to phenotyping for a particular trait and then introducing it to elite cultivars through repeated back-crossing. more recently, new approaches based on molecular analysis have emerged as a promising alternative. these approaches include linkage mapping analysis  <cit> , association mapping  <cit>  and allele mining  <cit> . recently, seven new functional alleles of powdery mildew resistance gene pm <dig>  have been isolated from hexaploid wheat landraces following the allele mining approach  <cit> . the focused identification of germplasm strategy used in this study has been successful in identifying new sources of powdery mildew resistance. however, the source of germplasm in this set was somewhat limited and the diversity of pm <dig> alleles remained unassessed in accessions that originated from countries other than the ones selected through figs. in this study here, we have isolated new pm <dig> alleles from nepal, ethiopia, china, argentina, sudan, mexico and iran. the newly identified functional pm <dig> alleles in the present study, pm3s and pm3t, originated from china and nepal respectively. this demonstrates that functional pm <dig> genetic diversity, i.e. new resistance genes, has not been exhausted yet and asian germplasm accessions are candidates to further screen for unique powdery mildew resistance sources. these new findings will also be useful in an iterative process to further refine the figs selection process by taking the data of newly identified resistant accessions into consideration, when searching for more variation in powdery mildew resistance.

pm <dig>  a gene with a large number of functional alleles
pm <dig> is one of the few plant resistance genes with a high number of known functional alleles. for the mla locus of barley, more than  <dig> race-specific resistance alleles have been described  <cit> . the sequence comparison of six isolated mla resistance alleles  revealed 90% sequence identity which led to the hypothesis that the mla powdery mildew resistance specificities represent allelic variants  <cit> . this hypothesis was further supported by a recent study, where  <dig> additional candidate mla cdnas have been isolated and they also represented allelic variants of the previously described mla resistance alleles  <cit> . forty-seven alleles of the rpp <dig> gene of a. thaliana controlling resistance to downy mildew have been isolated in two studies , where most of the accessions were collected from natural populations of a. thaliana across the united kingdom  <cit> . the flax rust resistance locus l is another example of a plant resistance gene with a large number of alleles and has been described to occur in  <dig> functional forms  <cit> . the two functional pm <dig> alleles reported in this study  further extend the previously known pm <dig> allelic series   <cit> . in addition to the  <dig> functional alleles, several pm <dig> alleles were isolated  from hexaploid  and tetraploid wheat accessions , for which no function as resistance genes could be assigned. thus, a total of  <dig> naturally occurring pm <dig> sequences are now known, including the susceptible ancestral sequence pm3cs .

pm <dig> allelic diversity: a molecular insight
the overall nucleotide diversity for all the pm <dig> sequences was calculated to be lower  than that described for other allelic series of plant resistance genes, for example, the rpp <dig> alleles  in a. thaliana, the mla powdery mildew resistance alleles  in barley and l alleles  conferring rust resistance in flax  <cit> . these data support the hypothesis of a recent divergence for pm <dig> alleles, as previously proposed  <cit> . most of the sequence polymorphisms were found in the lrr domain. the high non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide divergence value calculated for the lrr domain  indicates a strong diversifying selection acting on this part of the gene. this data support a major role of the lrr domain in recognition specificity for pm3-mediated resistance in wheat. this corresponds well to other studies where sequence variability in resistance genes or alleles was mostly found in the lrr encoding regions  <cit>  and diversifying selection was detected in solvent exposed residues  <cit> . the lrr encoding domain of the barley mla gene was also found to exhibit highest nucleotide diversity with a π value of  <dig>   <cit> .

the pm <dig> sequences differed mostly by point mutations and/or polymorphic sequence blocks that were further reshuffled between alleles. for example, the newly isolated allele pm3_ <dig>  possesses a sequence polymorphic block  identical to that present in pm3m and pm3r  <cit> . pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig>  share sequence identity within the polymorphic block with pm3c and pm3o, respectively, however only partially. previously, it has been shown that pm3r shares such a polymorphic sequence block with pm3a while pm3o shared another unique polymorphic block with fj <dig>  fj <dig> and fj <dig>  <cit> . pm3l, pm3p, pm3q and fj <dig> shared polymorphic blocks among each other, either completely or partially  <cit> . these polymorphic sequence blocks possibly derive from gene conversion and/or recombination events among different pm <dig> alleles. sequence exchange by gene conversion and recombination has been reported to be one of the major mechanisms of resistance gene evolution  <cit> . it is also likely to be a main mechanism of pm <dig> evolution in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat.

interestingly, the pm <dig> alleles from hexaploid and tetraploid wheat form two distinct groups specifically with regard to polymorphic sequence blocks unique to their respective ploidy levels. this was evident from the presence of a single large polymorphic sequence block covering lrr <dig> to lrr <dig>  <cit> , typically found in pm <dig> sequences isolated from tetraploid wheat accessions , with the rest of polymorphisms mostly in the form of snps . the remaining seven tetraploid pm <dig> sequences  either partially shared this block , had an entirely different sequence polymorphism pattern  or did not have the block but only a few snps  in comparison to pm3cs. the pm <dig> alleles isolated from hexaploid wheat accessions did not possess this particular polymorphic sequence block, except for pm3_ <dig> and pm3_ <dig> that completely or partially shared it. different hexaploid pm <dig> alleles possessed several small polymorphic blocks scattered over the length of the gene , in contrast to one large and evident block in tetraploid alleles.

some of the pm <dig> sequences appear to have originated due to insertion and deletion events, in addition to the point mutations and gene conversion . for example, pm3_ <dig>  pm3a, pm3b, pm3f, pm3m and pm3r bear a single 3bp insertion in comparison to pm3cs in the lrr- <dig> encoding region of the gene, and in addition to this, pm3a and pm3b bear another triplet insertion in the nbs encoding part of the gene. pm3l, fj <dig> and fj <dig> possess  <dig> bp deletions in the lrr encoding region, while fj <dig> lack 3bp in the nbs encoding region of the gene. these indel mutations do not compromise the full-length open reading frames, except for the two pseudogenes fj <dig> and pm3_ <dig>  the mla specificities, mla <dig>  mla <dig> and mla <dig> were also shown to possess insertions or deletions that mostly occurred in multiples of three nucleotides  <cit> . it was also suggested previously that pm <dig> recognition specificities can be generated rapidly by few mutational events in the pm3cs sequence  <cit> . this was evident with the isolation of functional pm <dig> alleles that differ from pm3cs by a few nucleotides. the new allele pm3_ <dig> differs by three nucleotides from the pm3cs sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
strategies that have been undertaken to approach genetic resources in order to identify new agronomically important genes include random selection based on geographical origin of accessions, core collections and focused identification of germplasm strategy . in different independent studies, these strategies have yielded new alleles/genes of high importance. however, efforts are still required to further improve these strategies so as they can potentially reduce phenotypic or genotypic screening but allow effective output. the wild accessions and landraces available in the gene banks evolved under a variety of edaphic and climatic environments and this might have resulted in evolution of ecotypes adapted to specific local environments. therefore, the choice for subset of accessions which is economically feasible to screen can be based on previous successful reports. for example, in the particular case of pm <dig> alleles, the previously unknown functional alleles have been isolated from accessions with their origin in turkey, afghanistan, turkmenistan, china and nepal  out of over  <dig> countries tested. therefore, it seems a promising approach to identify more powdery mildew resistance sources specifically from accessions originating from these countries and future projects could be focused on such origins.

the new functional alleles isolated in this project can now be transferred to susceptible but economically important wheat varieties as single genes or r-gene cassettes. besides this more applied aspects in wheat breeding, the now available  <dig> natural genetic variants of the pm <dig> gene isolated from accessions from all over the world provide a unique experimental set to explore and understand the molecular basis of the allelic specificity of resistance genes. the high conservation of sequence among pm <dig> alleles showing resistance against different spectra of pathogen races indicate that the pm <dig> specific resistance function must be determined by a relatively small number of nucleotides that are polymorphic among these alleles.
