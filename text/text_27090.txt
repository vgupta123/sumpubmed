BACKGROUND
a functional vasculature is important for the survival of vertebrates, as well as for proper embryonic development  <cit> . however, it is difficult to study this structure in most vertebrate models in vivo due to the opacity of the embryo as well as the in utero development in mammals. in this respect, the zebrafish model has two major advantages. first, due to the external development of its transparent embryos, it is convenient to observe internal structures and perform analysis of vascular development in vivo. second, the small size of the zebrafish embryo does not require high levels of oxygen uptake and thus passive gas diffusion alone is sufficient for its survival for a quite long time even without a functional circulatory system  <cit> .

the development of the zebrafish swimbladder has been described recently and its developmental events have been shown to be similar to that of early mammalian lung development  <cit> . as detected by the expression of hb <dig>  <cit>  and gfp in the gut-gfp transgenic line  <cit> , the swimbladder epithelial bud appears at ~ <dig> hpf as an evagination from the gut at the level of 2nd - 3rd somites on the left side of the embryo. after  <dig> hpf, the swimbladder enters the growth stage, where it starts to elongate rapidly and incorporate two other tissue layers, mesenchyme and outer mesothelium marked by the expression of fgf10a/acta <dig> and anxa <dig> respectively. the end result is a structure consisting of a pneumatic duct and a swimbladder main chamber which is inflated at  <dig> dpf.

during the growth phase, the early interactions between the three tissue layers of the swimbladder are regulated by the hedgehog pathway  <cit> . however developmental events after  <dig> hpf remain largely unexplored. therefore, a detailed analysis of late swimbladder development will complement our current understanding of swimbladder development and is highly desirable as the swimbladder is inflated and becomes a fully functional organ during this period.

the vascular anatomy of the zebrafish larvae has been described in great detail  <cit> . the importance of a functional circulatory system in the proper development of several organs has been highlighted in several studies in the zebrafish, including analyses of vasculogenesis in the liver  <cit> . since the swimbladder has been shown to be a vascularised organ, it is the aim of our study to characterize the vasculogenesis of the swimbladder in detail as well as to investigate the role of circulation in its development in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this process. to investigate the requirement of ecs in the development of swimbladder, clo-/- mutants lacking the endocardium and ecs  <cit> , were analysed using molecular markers specific for all three swimbladder tissue layers. to further elucidate the role of circulation in the development of swimbladder, we performed morpholino knockdown of tnnt <dig>  the general phenotype of which has been reported to phenocopy the silent heart mutant  <cit> , where blood flow does not occur due to defective cardiac contractility. we used two enhancer trap transgenic lines, etsq33- <dig> and etsqet <dig>  <cit> , with specific efgp expression in the inner epithelial and outer mesothelial layers of swimbladder, respectively, to perform functional analysis by generating the clo-/- mutant on the background of these lines as well as through tnnt <dig> morpholino knockdown. our results demonstrated the requirement of both endothelia and blood flow in sustaining swimbladder growth.

RESULTS
swimbladder vascular system
in order to characterize the vascular anatomy of the swimbladder in vivo, as well as to observe the dynamics of blood circulation in the developing swimbladder, we performed two genetic crosses between transgenic lines; etsq33- <dig> and tgy <dig>  were crossed to show blood vessels formation around swimbladder and etsq33- <dig> was crossed with tgsd <dig> for observation of erythrocytes circulating in the vessels and to identify the initiation of circulation.

our observations of  <dig> hpf embryos revealed that the swimbladder bud was not in contact with blood vessels . circulation in the nearby anterior mesenteric artery, which branched off into smaller supra-intestinal vessels, could be observed just anterior and ventral to the swimbladder . by  <dig> dpf, a large vessel with active circulation started to grow towards the swimbladder, although the smaller capillaries in contact with the swimbladder had not appeared yet . at the same time, the supra intestinal vessels formed more loops ventral to the swimbladder . by  <dig> hpf, blood circulation through the swimbladder capillaries penetrated the fully developed swimbladder . upon initial inflation of the swimbladder during this period, loops of blood vessels were observed covering its lateral surface . by  <dig> dpf, additional loops of vessels could be seen . these vessels were arranged in countercurrent pairs as a result of looping at their caudal ends .

epithelial budding and early growth is independent of ecs and blood circulation
previously, it has been shown that the early swimbladder formation consisted of three phases: budding , growth  and inflation   <cit> . in order to investigate whether swimbladder epithelial budding is dependent on ecs, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization analysis using the swimbladder epithelial marker hb <dig> in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae. at  <dig> hpf, the body size of clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant embryos are comparable to that of control. analysis of swimbladder epithelium using hb <dig> expression at this time indicated that budding was not affected by the absence of either ecs or blood circulation as swimbladder epithelium was present in both clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae . this observation was also confirmed in etsq33- <dig> transgenic line . moreover, we found no significant difference in the size of epithelium in all observed larvae as compared to control . the mesenchymal layer was also present as shown by fgf10a expression in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae from  <dig> hpf, but its organization appeared to be affected in both the mutant and morphant . therefore, by the end of the budding phase, the lack of ecs in clo-/- mutants, as well as the absence of blood circulation in tnnt <dig> morphants, did not affect the swimbladder epithelium. mesenchymal specification occurred on time in all observed larvae, though its organization appeared to be dependent on ecs as observed in clo-/- mutants.

by  <dig> hpf, the swimbladder epithelium in all observed larvae increased in size due to cell proliferation with an increased number of cells  <cit> , suggesting that the beginning of growth and initial extension of the swimbladder were similar in these mutant, morphant and wild type control fry .

contribution of ecs and blood flow to swimbladder development during later growth phase
by  <dig> hpf, the swimbladder epithelium in clo-/-mutant appeared to be larger than that at  <dig> hpf, indicating that growth could still occur. however, it did not appear to grow much further after budding, as evident by the presence of a short pneumatic duct, and its small size compared to that of wild type, which more resembled that in  <dig> -  <dig> hpf control larvae . while the anterior chamber primordium could be observed in wild type, it was absent in clo-/- mutants . these observations suggest that ecs are required during the early stage of swimbladder growth between  <dig> hpf to  <dig> hpf. however, the epithelium in tnnt <dig> morphant appeared to grow past the budding stage , and it possessed a long and apparent pneumatic duct. nevertheless, the swimbladder epithelium in tnnt <dig> morphants did not appear to have the anterior chamber primordium .

whole mount observations revealed that, at  <dig> hpf, the mesenchyme in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae was shorter than that in wild type control larvae . moreover, its organization was interrupted in tnnt <dig> morphant larvae and even more so in clo-/- mutant . additionally, mesenchymal differentiation into smooth muscle was affected in both clo-/- and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae, as indicated by the absence of acta <dig> expression .

the outer mesothelium in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant appeared to be disorganized as well , although the two inner layers were present . this was also confirmed by the expression of outer mesothelial marker anxa <dig> . by  <dig> hpf, cells positive for egfp in the etsqet <dig> on the clo-/- background could be seen as a disorganized mass of cells around the swimbladder domain . in tnnt <dig> morphant, more outer mesothelial cells could be observed; however, they were also disorganized .

lack of swimbladder inflation in the absence of ecs and blood flow
at  <dig> dpf, the swimbladder of clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant larvae remained uninflated . observation in etsq33- <dig> revealed that the swimbladder epithelium in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant were hypoplastic and only developed until a certain growth stage . the outer mesothelium also showed a partially disorganized pattern with scattered cells especially at the posterior part .

in summary, ecs and blood circulation are not involved in the specification of the swimbladder epithelium, but are required for its growth at later stages. although, in the absence of ecs, the mesenchyme develops at the same time as in wild type, it lacks organization and fails to differentiate into smooth muscle. similarly, these developmental defects do not affect the specification of the outer mesothelium, but they affect the organization of this layer.

discussion
endothelial cells affect the growth of swimbladder
ecs are main components of the circulatory system. they are specified early during development and subsequently become the building blocks of blood vessels  <cit> . their involvement in the development of the liver  <cit>  and pancreas  <cit>  have been extensively described. our observation of swimbladder in clo-/- mutants shows that swimbladder budding is not affected in the absence of ecs, while growth of the swimbladder after bud stage, the organization of the mesenchyme and outer mesothelium, and differentiation of mesenchyme into muscle seem to be dependent on them. the requirement of ecs only for later stages of growth is consistent with that observed in liver development  <cit> . in our previous study, we have demonstrated that ecs contribute to the formation of sinusoids in liver, which contribute directly to liver size and the organization of hepatocytes  <cit> . the ability of ecs to induce and regulate the growth of adjacent cells has also been demonstrated in the liver of mice and humans  <cit> . however, although lined with a network of blood capillaries, the swimbladder is structurally very distinct from the liver. first of all, it is a thin uniform layer of cells with a hollow cavity in the center lumen, unlike the liver which is densely packed with hepatocytes. secondly, ecs interact directly with individual hepatocytes in the liver, forming a specific arrangement of hepatocytes around each sinusoid  <cit> , which does not occur in the swimbladder. therefore, the contribution of ecs in swimbladder growth is unlikely a structural one.

in the zebrafish, vasculature in the swimbladder is already present by  <dig> hpf  <cit> . in clo-/- mutants, the swimbladder appeared to be arrested in growth at around  <dig> -  <dig> hpf. thus it seems that during this period, ecs provide certain morphogenic signals which are required for swimbladder growth, and in this way affect the organization of the outer mesothelium. it has been known that ecs could secrete many factors, including mitogenic and chemotactic factors  <cit> . the ability of ecs to induce and regulate growth has also been demonstrated in the liver of mice and humans  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that these signals may affect cell proliferation and organization of swimbladder and contribute in this manner into its growth.

a functional blood circulation contributes to normal growth of the swimbladder
a functional blood circulation is known to be essential for liver growth  <cit> . therefore it is likely that blood circulation contributes to swimbladder growth as well. although the exact mechanism is yet to be determined, blood circulation likely stimulates growth through their delivery of nutrients and other factors which induce cell proliferation and possibly differentiation. in agreement with our previous observations on the liver  <cit> , the lack of blood circulation did not affect the budding stage of swimbladder either. neither did it affect early stages of growth , as the swimbladder bud continued to elongate, forming the pneumatic duct and the main chamber. the systemic blood circulation in zebrafish is initiated at  <dig> hpf. there has been no investigation into the precise timing of blood flow initiation in the swimbladder vasculature. however, it has been previously observed that the swimbladder artery is already filled with circulating blood by  <dig> dpf  <cit> . our observation of tgsd <dig> line showed that by  <dig> dpf, a branch of the anterior mesenteric artery leading to the swimbladder becomes active . this timing almost coincides with the timing of growth cessation in the swimbladder of tnnt <dig> morphants after  <dig> hpf, as evident by the absence of the anterior chamber primordium in clo-/- mutant and tnnt <dig> morphant even at  <dig> hpf; in contrast, the anterior chamber primodium appears at round  <dig> hpf in wild type fry. this also explains the disorganization of mesenchyme which takes place at around this time, and hence, the disruption observed in the outer mesothelium.

the inability of swimbladder to inflate in tnnt <dig> morphants could be a consequence of the lack of blood circulation as well. it is known that the vascular network of the swimbladder carries oxygen and carbon dioxide which could diffuse into the swimbladder. this mechanism serves to maintain the volume of the swimbladder  <cit> . it is possible that the lack of a functional circulation makes it impossible to maintain an inflated state of the swimbladder even after uptake of air bubbles from the surface. however, given the fact that the inflation of the swimbladder depends on surface air-gulping  <cit>  , which in turn depends on coordinated activity of several organs, including the nervous and muscular system that could be affected by pan-embryonic knockout of gene activity, it is important to ascertain that the anomaly of swimbladder inflation is linked to changes in its structure. the ability of swimbladder to act as a vessel for gas exchange resembles that of the mammalian lungs. in the lungs, a network of capillaries surrounds the alveoli and oxygen and carbon dioxide could be exchanged between the bloodstream and the atmosphere. despite the distinct functions of the swimbladder and lungs in aquatic and terrestrial animals, this striking similarity illustrates a possible retention of ancestral features for gas exchange in both organs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the lack of ecs or blood circulation has no effect on swimbladder development during budding stage, but affects its growth in early growth phase by the lack of ecs and in late growth phase by the lack of blood circulation. the organization of mesenchyme and its subsequent differentiation into smooth muscle, as well as organization of outer mesothelium, were also interrupted by the absence of either ecs or blood circulation. based on these observations, we conclude that, although not critical for the specification of swimbladder cells, vasculature plays a crucial role in growth of this organ, with ecs contributing to early growth phase and blood circulation to later events of the growth phase. both ecs and blood circulation are also necessary for the differentiation of mesenchymal smooth muscle and organization of the outer mesothelium in swimbladder, which in turn is essential for the proper functioning of the organ as reflected in its ability to inflate. thus, our study indicates a similar role of ecs and blood circulation in development of swimbladder and liver, where the absence of ecs and/or blood circulation does not affect budding but growth of these organs  <cit> .
