BACKGROUND
pyometra, purulent bacterial infection of the uterus, is a common diagnosis in intact female dogs. differences in incidence rates between breeds are reported  <cit> . ovariohysterectomy  is the treatment of choice, but is not always life-saving. the mortality ranges between 3-10%  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria, mainly escherichia coli , are most often isolated from the uterus  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria contain endotoxin which is released during bacterial growth or death, and endotoxin present in the bloodstream is a potent inducer of systemic inflammation  <cit> . several studies have reported that the majority of dogs with pyometra also suffer from sepsis   <cit> . sepsis is a serious condition frequently leading to organ dysfunctions in animals and humans. despite modern treatments, sepsis associated with organ dysfunctions is a main cause of death  in human intensive care units  <cit> . early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of sepsis is crucial for survival  <cit> . diagnosing sepsis can be challenging because clinical signs and results of laboratory variable analyses are not unique for septic patients and there is no reliable diagnostic marker. in pyometra, certain clinical and laboratory analysis results can be valuable in the prediction of outcome as measured by prolonged postoperative hospitalization and presence of peritonitis  <cit> . the bacterial infection of the uterus stimulates the release of cytokines, lymphokines and other chemical mediators, which in turn trigger hepatic production of acute phase proteins  <cit> . successful surgical treatment of the disease leads to rapid improvement of abnormalities in hematological, biochemical and inflammatory variables  <cit> . in human medicine, analysis of c-reactive protein  and procalcitonin are widely used for diagnosing inflammatory diseases and to predict outcome and increased concentrations are observed in septic patients  <cit> . in veterinary medicine, crp and saa have been investigated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in several diseases  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that saa analysis was valuable for identifying malignancy associated with inflammation in humans  <cit> . in dogs, it has been reported that saa concentrations are less frequently increased in healthy dogs compared to crp which indicates that saa may be a more specific marker for systemic inflammation  <cit> . albumin is considered to be a negative acute phase protein because serum concentrations decrease in inflammation and/or infection. hypoalbuminemia in response to infection or inflammation is likely due to decreased production by the liver and/or increased vascular permeability that may lead to extravasal accumulation of albumin  <cit> . albumin concentrations decrease in sepsis and may be valuable as a negative prognostic biomarker for survival  <cit> . although controversial, albumin has been used as adjunctive treatment in septic animals  <cit> . serum albumin is routinely analyzed in clinical laboratories and therefore accessible in most veterinary clinics. saa has so far not been investigated in sepsis and associations between saa, crp and albumin have not been assessed in canine pyometra. the aim of the present study was to determine saa, crp and albumin concentrations in dogs with sepsis and pyometra and to evaluate whether these inflammatory markers are associated with length of postoperative hospitalization.

inflammatory markers
the mean saa concentration were significantly higher in septic compared to non-septic bitches  . if a cut-off value of saa of  <dig>  mg/l was selected , the sensitivity and specificity for detecting sepsis was 74% and 50%, respectively. the receiver operating characteristic curve  analysis displayed an area under the curve  of  <dig>  for saa in the dogs with sepsis  . in four bitches with sepsis and one non-septic bitch, the saa concentration exceeded 180 mg/l . the mean concentrations of crp and serum albumin were not significantly higher in septic compared to non-septic bitches  . in the three bitches with positive blood cultures , the concentrations of crp were  <dig>   <dig> and 298 mg/l, concentrations of saa were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l and concentrations of albumin  <dig>   <dig> and 20 g/l. four out of  <dig> bitches in septic group required prolonged hospitalization. in the non-septic group, none of the bitches stayed longer in the hospital than two days after surgery. none of the inflammatory markers investigated  were associated with prolonged postoperative hospitalization.table  <dig>

discussion
concentrations of saa were higher in bitches with sepsis compared to those without sepsis. this is the first time that a possible clinical value of saa analysis for identification of sepsis in dogs is reported. however, the cut-off value for saa of  <dig>  mg/l used, yielded a sensitivity of 74% for detecting bitches with sepsis which is lower than the 97% sensitivity reported previously when using the clinical criteria hr, rr, wbc/percentage band neutrophils and rectal temperature for determination of sirs  <cit> . using criteria for sepsis that have high sensitivity is more important than a high specificity because including non-septic bitches in the septic group would not endanger their condition. but to include truly septic bitches in the non-septic group with less optimal treatment could have serious consequences for the individual bitch. a specificity of 50% means that saa cannot be used as a single variable for diagnosing sepsis because 50% truly septic bitches would be classified as non-septic. the low specificity was not surprising because saa is regarded as an unspecific variable because concentrations increase in all diseases with systemic inflammation. however, saa could be a potential adjunctive marker for sepsis in dogs, if used in combination with the clinical sirs criteria or other markers that increase the sensitivity and specificity for sepsis diagnosis. saa concentrations were significantly increased in septic dogs which points to a possible higher clinical value for saa in the detection of sepsis compared with crp, and this potential deserves to be further investigated. a larger study is necessary to investigate if a clinically useful cut-off value for saa in sepsis  can be established.

in this study, the finding of a clinical value of saa is in line with other studies in which saa has shown more promise as a diagnostic marker than crp for gastrointestinal disorders linked with inflammation  <cit> . in human medicine, saa has also been shown to be a better prognostic marker for severity of cancer associated with inflammation  <cit> . though not caused by infection, this points to a diverse capacity of crp and saa and that there are conditions or diseases for which saa could have a clinically higher diagnostic or prognostic value than the more frequently used crp. that crp and saa levels have different diagnostic abilities in spite of both being major acute phase proteins in dogs is in agreement with the findings of one study in which crp concentrations were only moderately positively correlated with saa concentrations  <cit> .

concentrations of albumin were not significantly different in bitches with or without sepsis. this finding was unforeseen since lower albumin concentrations have been reported in sepsis and decrease in experimentally induced endotoxemia in dogs, cats and rats  <cit> . however, the clinical situation is different from experimental studies in that the studied dogs were admitted at various stages of disease progression and the effect of endotoxemia may therefore be less prominent. albumin might have a diagnostic value in dogs with pyometra and more severe disease , but this needs to be further studied. hypoalbuminemia was earlier detected in 81%  of these bitches with pyometra which is in line with other reports and also indicate that albumin could be interesting to study as a possible sepsis marker  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria, foremost e. coli, were isolated from the uterine content which is similar to most other studies of the disease  <cit> . that pyometra induces hypoalbuminemia is not surprising because hypoalbuminemia has been reported as an effect of gram-negative infection and bacteremia  <cit> . to date, no study has specifically investigated albumin as a marker for sepsis in dogs. the results presented here suggest that albumin could be clinically useful as an adjunctive marker for diagnosis of pyometra, but albumin does not seem to be as valuable as saa in the detection of sepsis.

increased concentrations of crp have previously been shown to be associated with presence of sirs and prolonged hospitalization in bitches with pyometra, supporting the usefulness of crp analysis in clinical practice  <cit> . moreover, increased crp concentrations have been associated with increased mortality in dogs with sirs and sepsis  <cit> . in the present study, higher crp concentrations were not associated with sepsis which is in contrast to a previous report  <cit> . this report was larger, including  <dig> septic and  <dig> non-septic bitches, which could somewhat explain the difference in results, since otherwise the sampling methods and patient inclusion criteria were similar. pyometra often induces sepsis, as demonstrated in the present study where 74% of the bitches were sirs-positive. this proportion is of the same magnitude  as has been reported previously in the disease  <cit> . however, by using the selected sirs-criteria with a specificity of 64%, 36% non-septic bitches will be included in the septic group  <cit> . there are several criteria are available to define sirs in dogs, based on the different cut-off values with different specificity and sensitivity  <cit> . using sirs-criteria with the highest sensitivity  available is advisable since it is important to not clinically misdiagnose a truly septic dog as non-septic which could lead to less optimal monitoring and treatment resulting in a poor outcome. however, the lack of more specific clinical criteria available for sepsis is a limitation of the study. another limitation is that the samples were freeze-stored up to 8 months before analysis. however, crp and saa have been shown to be very stable at room temperature and storage  <cit> . depression, anorexia, polydipsia/polyuria and vaginal discharge are common clinical signs in bitches with pyometra, emphasizing the systemic effects of the illness in the studied bitches  <cit> . of all hematology and biochemistry variables analyzed, band neutrophils, basophils and monocytes were increased in septic bitches. these results were in line of other studies in response to infection and chronic disease  <cit> . because band neutrophils and wbc are included in the criteria used to define sepsis, these and other variables linked with wbc can therefore not be considered as independent. for prediction outcome, as measured by length of hospitalization, none of the markers analyzed in the present study were useful, but a larger study material would be beneficial for further evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
saa concentrations were increased in dogs with sepsis induced by pyometra whereas concentrations of crp and albumin did not differ between septic and non-septic bitches. this indicates that saa may have a potential clinical value for the detection of sepsis. the selected cut-off value to investigate the ability of saa as marker for sepsis resulted in relatively low sensitivity and specificity suggesting that saa cannot be used as a single marker for this purpose. further studies of larger patient groups should be performed to evaluate the potential value of saa in the detection of sepsis in dogs.
