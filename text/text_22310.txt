BACKGROUND
the calcium concentration of the inner ear luminal fluid, endolymph , is much lower than that of the basolateral fluid, perilymph   <cit> . the low ca2+ level is essential for the normal transduction of sound and acceleration for hearing and balance  <cit> . it has been assumed that there likely are one or more ca2+ absorptive mechanisms in the inner ear. we previously demonstrated that transcripts of a novel ca2+ absorptive system are expressed in primary cultures of rat semicircular canal duct .

the ca2+ absorptive system  <cit>  is comprised of an apical membrane entry pathway , a cytosolic ca2+ buffer protein , and basolateral ca2+ exit pathways  and plasma membrane ca2+-atpases ). expression of these transporters can be regulated by the active form of vitamin d,  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  <cit> . ca2+ that enters the cell through the apical trpv5/ <dig> channel is buffered by the calbindin and transported by diffusion in bound form across the cell, from which it is released across the basolateral cell membrane via the pmca and ncx transporters. the predominant apical channel in kidney is trpv <dig> and in the intestine it is trpv <dig>  <cit> .

observations of this transport system in the ear have been limited to transcript expression in primary cultures of rat sccd for all of the transport system genes  <cit> , immunolocalization in mouse cochlea and vestibular labyrinth of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig>  <cit> , and radiolabeled ca2+ fluxes in primary cultures of rat sccd  <cit> .

the questions remained whether 1) the system of epithelial ca2+ transport genes was also expressed in the cochlea, 2) whether native inner ear tissues expressed the same constellation of genes as the primary cultures of sccd, 3) whether transcript expression in rat tissues resulted in protein expression of epithelial ca2+ channel genes with a distribution similar to mouse and 3) whether tissues from each represented region of the inner ear that express epithelial ca2+ transport genes responded to  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  the present study addressed those questions. evaluation of protein expression used primary cultures to obtain sufficient material for immunoblots and used sections of rat cochlea and sccd for immunostaining.

RESULTS
the "primary cultures" of sccd refer to epithelial cells from neonatal sccd that have been seeded on permeable supports and have proliferated to confluence over  <dig> or more days. the proliferation and re-differentiation in vitro and the attachment to a new surface all carry the risk of altered gene expression compared to canals in vivo. the tissues that we refer to as "native" were explants that were incubated for only  <dig> hours in vitro, that experienced no changes to proliferative and re-differentiation phases nor attachment to a new surface. the acute incubation of the explants was necessary to study possible changes to gene expression in response to vitamin d and for an untreated control series.

mrna expression
levels of transcript expression for all components and isoforms of the epithelial calcium absorption pathway are shown in fig.  <dig> for isolated native tissues from the vestibular labyrinth  and cochlea . results from primary cultures of neonatal sccd  <cit>  are shown for reference.

the epithelial calcium channel trpv <dig> was expressed in all tissue fractions, while trpv <dig> was expressed in all tissue fractions except stria vascularis. the absolute quantities of each gene transcript cannot be unambiguously compared since the efficiency of the rt step for each primer is not known. however, the ratios between the apparent trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> transcripts can be compared among tissues. the apparent trpv5:trpv <dig> transcript expression ratio in adult sccd was  <dig> , neonatal sccd was <dig>  much higher in stria vascularis since trpv <dig> was not detectable but only  <dig>  in the lateral wall. the high trpv5:trpv <dig> ratio in adult sccd compared to neonatal primary cultures  was not a result of changes during development. trpv <dig> in native neonatal sccd was expressed at  <dig> times the level of trpv <dig> . the expression of trpv <dig> relative to trpv <dig> is therefore in the sequence stria vascularis > neonatal sccd > adult sccd > cochlear lateral wall > primary culture sccd.

the calcium-buffering calbindin proteins, calbindin-d9k and calbindin-d28k, were expressed in native sccd, lateral wall and stria vascularis of adult rat as well as in primary culture sccd . the relatively low gene expression levels reported here likely reflects a low reverse transcription efficiency of the primers but may also reflect a low level of transcript expression. all isoforms of the sodium-calcium exchanger  were expressed as mrna by all native tissues as well as by cultured sccd . all four isoforms of the plasma membrane calcium atpase  were found in the cochlear tissues, while only three isoforms  were found in the sccd  . the relatively low level of expression of pmca <dig> in stria vascularis suggests a minor role in the function of this tissue and could conceivably represent a low level of contamination from other tissues. vitamin d receptor transcripts were found in all native tissues  as well as in primary cultures of sccd.

addition of  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> for  <dig> h increased the expression of trpv <dig> in native sccd , as in primary cultures  <cit> , but not significantly in lateral wall or stria vascularis . calbindin-d9k was significantly up regulated by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> in native sccd  and lateral wall  but not in stria vascularis .  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> did not significantly up-regulate the expression of calbindin-d28k in any of the native tissues, even though it did in primary cultures of sccd . ncx <dig> in the lateral wall was the only sodium-calcium exchanger that was up-regulated  by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  none of the pmcas were up-regulated by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  while there were small but significant decreases of pmca <dig> in sccd and of pmca <dig> in lateral wall.  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> exposure did not significantly change the expression level of the vitamin d receptor in any tissues.

protein expression of trpv5: immunoblot
trpv <dig> protein migrated to about  <dig> kda  for cultured sccd as well as native kidney cortex  of neonatal rat but not in kidney papilla . pretreatment of the primary antibody with antigenic peptide  markedly reduced the intensity of the  <dig> kda band, whereas the band near  <dig> kda was not blocked with antigenic peptide. non-specific bands appeared sporadically at  <dig> kda in kidney and sccd. the suggestion of a double band  in sccd could represent two types of post-translational modification, two levels of glycosylation or non-specific labelling of the upper band. the  <dig> kda band is similar in size to the calculated molecular weight of trpv <dig>   <dig>  kda. exposure to  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> did not significantly increase protein expression of trpv <dig> in the primary cultured cells. xenopus leavis oocytes transfected with human trpv <dig> cdna showed  <dig> additional bands for trpv <dig> and they were sensitive to pngase f  <cit> . by contrast, there were no bands from sccd that were susceptible to pngase f treatment . the antibody for trpv <dig> did not react with specific bands in immunoblots.

protein expression of trpv <dig> and trpv6: immunohistochemistry
the distribution of the epithelial calcium absorptive system was examined in more detail by immunostaining of cochlear and vestibular structures for trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> . in the vestibular system , the only staining of epithelial cells was observed in the sccd. the sccd epithelial cells are only  <dig> μm tall, making it difficult to clearly discern differential staining of the apical and basolateral membrane for low copy number membrane proteins. we visualized specific labeling of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> in the sccd by opening the pin-hole of the confocal microscope in order to integrate the signal over a greater area and depth . the specificity of the signal was assured by the total absence of staining of the surrounding bone and of sections prepared in the absence of primary antibody . no epithelial staining was seen in the utricle or ampullae . phalloidin staining aided the identification of epithelial cells by the location of the actin ring associated with the tight junction complex.

in the cochlea , strong immunostaining for trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> was observed in both the inner sulcus and outer sulcus epithelial cells, as well as the hensen's cells medial to the outer sulcus . the outer sulcus is part of the "lateral wall" fraction included in the mrna determinations. the observations of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> protein expression in the inner sulcus and hensen's cells extends our knowledge of the expression pattern. marginal cells of the stria vascularis were labeled for trpv <dig>  but not trpv <dig>  protein expression near the apical membrane. the staining in stria vascularis for trpv <dig> was repeatable but variable. when the stria vascularis was immunoreactive, the marginal cells were strongly stained .

discussion
the level of endolymphatic  is controlled by both secretory mechanisms  and absorptive mechanisms. the present paper reports the first evidence for the expression of all genes necessary to constitute a complete transepithelial ca2+ absorptive pathway in native tissues of the inner ear. we previously reported that cochlear outer sulcus cells and vestibular transitional cells have apical nonselective cation channels that are likely permeable to ca2+  <cit> , but their contribution to transepithelial ca2+ absorption is not known.

expression
the transmural absorption of ca2+ by a number of epithelia has recently been ascribed to a set of genes that encode the apical entry channels trpv <dig> and trpv <dig>  the cytosolic ca2+ buffering proteins calbindin-d9k and calbindin-d28k, and the basolateral ca2+-extruding transporters sodium-calcium exchangers  and plasma membrane calcium atpases   <cit> . in other epithelial, either trpv <dig> or trpv <dig> is expressed at a higher level, but in spite of the large array of epithelia surveyed previously  <cit> , expression of this transport system in the inner ear was not reported. we demonstrated here that all components of the epithelial ca2+ channel transport system were found to be expressed as transcripts in the vestibular sccd and cochlea.

our results validate the primary culture of sccd in terms of the presence of all the genes that participate in ca2+ absorption and regulation, although the relative expression level of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> was observed to be substantially reduced in culture compared to the native cells. this apparent discrepancy is consistent with the lack of  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> in the control culture medium , whereas the native tissues were exposed to intermediate levels of the hormone in vivo prior to sacrifice. trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> form homo- and hetero-tetrameric channel complexes and regulation of the relative expression levels of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> may be a mechanism for fine-tuning ca2+ transport kinetics in trpv5/6-expressing tissues  <cit> .

quantification of expression levels has intrinsic problems. first, there can be large discrepancies between levels of transcripts and levels of the corresponding proteins. further, the proteins can receive various post-translational modifications and trafficked to different destinations with a consequent multiplicity and altered level of function. second, seemingly anomalous results due to imprecision of ct determination in rt-pcr and its logarithmic relation to transcript number can occur, leading to calculated large fold-changes in expression that do not reach statistical significance .

trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> gene expression in the inner ear was also demonstrated at the level of protein. sufficient protein could be obtained from primary cultures of sccd to allow immunoblot observation of trpv <dig>  interestingly, immunoblot data did not show a significant difference in trpv <dig> expression between control and  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> treated sccd cells. this result is not consistent with the functional data from the same preparation that show an upregulation by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> of radiolabeled ca2+ fluxes in primary cultures of sccd  <cit> . the apparent discrepancy could be accounted for by 1) the increased transcript expression not affecting protein amount and 2) an upregulation by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> of another controlling part of the transport system. the ineffectiveness of pngase f treatment for trpv <dig> suggests the occurrence of other posttranslational modifications than glycosylation or a low abundance of glycosylated protein.

immunolocalization of both epithelial ca2+ channels was consistent with the transcript data for both the vestibular system and for the cochlea. in addition to the cochlear localization of the strial marginal cells and the outer sulcus of the lateral wall, these channels were also observed in the inner sulcus epithelial cells of the rat inner ear. recent observations in mouse show similar cellular locations, although the preponderance of trpv <dig> or trpv <dig> in some cells differs  <cit> . our data demonstrate that the earlier findings were not strictly limited to one species. the antibodies used do not restrict their binding to membrane proteins, so that there is staining of protein in the cytosol, preventing the subcellular localization of trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> to the apical and/or basolateral membranes. in addition, the antibody against trpv <dig> did not function in immunoblots.

the other genes required for ca2+ absorption--calbindin-d9k, calbindin-d28k, ncx <dig> and pmca1b--were previously found to be involved in ca2+ absorption by the kidney  <cit> . calbindin-d9k can prevent calcium-dependent inactivation of trpv5/ <dig> by buffering overloaded ca2+ beneath the apical side while calbindin-d28k is freely diffusible in the cytoplasm  <cit> . we evaluated all isoforms of ncx1- <dig> and pmca1- <dig> in the inner ear tissues.

pmca was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry to be present in the basolateral membrane of strial marginal cells and reissner's membrane epithelial cells  <cit> . ncx <dig> and pmca <dig> were the predominant isoforms expressed in the inner ear, as in the kidney. however, other isoforms were also found to be present. pmca <dig> was not expressed in either native or cultured sccd and virtually absent in stria vascularis. absence of pmca <dig> in stria vascularis is compatible with previous reports  <cit> . expression of pmca <dig> in the lateral wall fraction might arise from contributions by reissner's membrane  <cit> . pmca <dig> is therefore not likely important for inner ear ca2+ absorption; rather its function is likely limited to ca2+ secretion at the apical membrane of hair cells  <cit>  and possibly reissner's membrane  <cit> .

our detection of pmca <dig> and pmca <dig> in all tissue fractions is at variance with previous reports for the cochlea  <cit> . it is possible to attribute these discrepancies to species differences. a previous immunohistochemical study showed calbindin-d28k expression in musk shrew spiral ganglion, inner and outer hair cells, but expression in lateral wall was only observed during pre-natal ages  <cit> . by contrast, we observed expression of calbindin-d28k in lateral wall fractions of young adult rats.

regulation
a wide range of signal pathways converge to control ca2+ absorption. an important control mechanism is regulation of the number of expressed apical entry ca2+ channels and calbindins by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  it is apparently characteristic of different epithelia that  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> up-regulates predominantly one channel isoform through activation of the vitamin d receptor  <cit> . caco- <dig> cells up-regulate trpv <dig> in a time- and dose-dependent manner  <cit> . by contrast,  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> up-regulates trpv <dig>  but not trpv <dig>  in kidney  <cit>  and sccd .

two isoforms of calbindin, calbindin-d9k and -d28k, are expressed in the inner ear epithelia and calbindin-d9k transcript expression is up-regulated by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  it has been shown that calbindin-d9k is localized near both the apical and basolateral plasma membranes  <cit> , while calbindin-d28k is freely diffusible in the cytoplasm  <cit>  but translocates to the apical membrane to associate with the trpv <dig>  <cit> . one function of calbindin-d28k is to prevent ca2+ from binding to calmodulin, which can block trpv <dig> by binding to the cooh-terminal region  <cit> . interaction with either channel is important since the functional channel is likely a tetraheteromer of trpv5/trpv <dig>  both calbindins, ncx <dig> and pmca1b genes were up-regulated in hormone-deficient 1α-ohase-/- mice by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  <cit> .

ncx and pmca isoform expression levels were not uniformly changed by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> in the sccd, lateral wall and stria vascularis. ncx <dig> in the lateral wall may be important for the ca2+ absorption pathway because of its up-regulation by  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  but the reason why pmca <dig> in sccd and pmca <dig> in lateral wall were down-regulated is not clear. the lack of response of all genes in the stria vascularis may indicate that this transport system is not functional in stria. alternatively, it may represent a vitamin d-insensitive transport system in this tissue.

the activity of the trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> channels is steeply controlled by both intra- and extracellular ph  <cit> . the strong inhibition by acid extracellular ph is of particular interest in view of pathologic conditions leading to lowered ph in both cochlear and vestibular endolymph . epithelial ca2+ channel activity can further be controlled by pip <dig>  providing a link to a variety of g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> .

physiological significance
the question naturally arises whether this transport system is relevant at the whole organ level. several observations demonstrate the functionality of this system and point to its importance in hearing and balance. it was recently shown that sccd epithelial cells take up radiolabeled ca2+ more rapidly from the apical side than from the basolateral side, that the net uptake is increased in the presence of  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig> and that the apical uptake is inhibited by acidic luminal ph   <cit> . it was therefore predicted that any condition that results in an acidification of endolymph would also lead to increased luminal  and a consequent decrease in cochlear and vestibular function, which depend on the normally low endolymphatic   <cit> . indeed, mutations or deletion of the bicarbonate-secreting transporter pendrin  lead to hearing and balance deficits in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . deletion of pendrin led to acidified endolymph and consequently a dramatic elevation of endolymphatic  in both the cochlea  <cit>  and the utricle  <cit> . this observation suggests that the trpv5/ <dig> ca2+ absorption system plays a highly significant physiological role in endolymph ca2+ homeostasis, even though the endocochlear potential apparently plays a strong role by providing a driving force for passive efflux  <cit> .

calcium homeostasis in the inner ear via trpv5/ <dig> could play an important role in causes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo  and may therefore be an effective drug target. bppv is characterized by brief episodes of nystagmus and vertigo in response to certain movements of the head. it is thought to be caused by dislodged otoliths  from the utricle that enter one of the semicircular canals, leading to inappropriate stimulation of canal. a recent study reported that strong correlations in human patients were observed between diagnosis of bppv and disturbed calcium homeostasis as reflected in reduced bone mineral density  <cit> .

vitamin d has been implicated in hearing function. ikeda and associates found that vitamin d deficiency resulted in hearing impairment in rats  <cit>  and that 80% of patients in a study with bilateral sensory neural hearing loss  were found to be deficient in  <dig> -2vitamin d <dig>  <cit> . importantly, the patients with bsnhl and low serum vitamin d had normal serum ca2+, consistent with a local effect of vitamin d deficiency in the auditory and vestibular periphery. the vitamin d-deficient rats had a reduced perilymphatic  level, making the interpretation less clear. it was not known whether the observed effects were due to direct effects on the epithelial calcium channel system , to the lowered systemic , or to other causes. nonetheless, the correlations are consistent with a direct action on the system reported here.

the dysfunction of ca2+ absorption by mutation or absence of the trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> genes would be expected to lead to impaired hearing and balance. it is perhaps more than a coincidence, therefore, that the genes for trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> are located on chromosome 7q <dig> and 7q33- <dig> respectively in human  <cit>  and the locus of the non-syndromic deafness gene  <cit>  dfnb <dig> is located at the encompassing region on chromosome 7q34- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
both the cochlea and the vestibular system were found to express all genes needed to constitute a ca2+ absorption mechanism that can maintain the low levels of endolymphatic  needed to sustain normal hearing and balance. the native semicircular canal expresses all of the ca2+ transport genes found previously in the culture system. no other epithelial cells in the vestibular system were found to express epithelial ca2+ channels. specific cochlear epithelial cells that express trpv <dig> and trpv <dig> include those of the inner and outer sulcus and hensen's cells. strial marginal cells of the cochlea also express trpv <dig> but not trpv <dig>  these components of the epithelial ca2+ absorption pathway likely play an important role in ca2+ homeostasis of endolymph.
