BACKGROUND
reactive oxygen species  play an important and critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation
 <cit> . however, high levels of ros are also shown to cause detrimental effects in the brain that negatively affect neuronal plasticity and memory function
 <cit> . for instance, excessive  increased levels of ros are associated with decreased cognitive performance in both vertebrate and invertebrate species
 <cit> . under normal physiological conditions, the potential damaging effects of ros is controlled by robust antioxidant defense systems. however, excessive formation of free radicals due to for instance an inflammatory reaction or failing antioxidant capacity as observed in aging, might overwhelm the antioxidant defense capacity of an organism resulting in oxidative stress. oxidative stress may cause structural damage to nucleotides, lipids and proteins. the neuronal plasmamembrane is particularly prone to oxidative insult due to its high poly-unsaturated fatty acid  content
 <cit> . many processes participate in the repair of oxidative damage to cellular components. in the case of membrane phospholipids, members of the phospholipase a <dig>  family of fatty acid acylases that catalyze hydrolysis of sn- <dig> lipid bonds in glycerophospholipids are key players
 <cit> . pla2’s promote the formation of lysophopholipids and free fatty acids  such as arachidonic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid 
 <cit> . under normal physiological conditions pla <dig>  its products and their metabolites play essential roles in regulating signal transduction, various neuronal signaling pathways, ion channel functioning and gene transcription processes
 <cit> . under conditions of oxidative stress pla <dig> is one of the mediators through which peroxidized fatty acids are excised from the lipid bilayer matrix
 <cit> . recent evidence increasingly associates deregulation of lipid metabolism due to pla <dig>  activation as a cause of nervous system dysfunction and cognitive impairment
 <cit> . yet, the physiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain incompletely resolved.

our current research on the foundations of learning and memory impairment in the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis  focuses on the question of lipid-peroxidation dependent facets of neuronal dysfunction
 <cit> . the present study follows from our recent observations implicating age-, inflammation- and experimental oxidative stress-induced pla <dig> activity in long-term memory  failure
 <cit> . considering the pivotal role of pla <dig> activation in behavioural plasticity, we investigated the question whether it is the fatty acids released upon pla <dig> activation that causes cognitive impairment in our model system. here we utilized an established and widely studied classical appetitive reward-conditioning paradigm involving chemosensory conditioning of the animals’ feeding behaviour i.e., “rasping”
 <cit> . using this model we investigated the effects of experimentally pro-oxidant induced pla <dig> activation on associative appetitive ltm impairment and the role of circulating ffas therein. we will provide evidence that increased levels of circulating oxidized fatty acids are not a factor in oxidative stress induced ltm impairment.

RESULTS
enhanced levels of extracellular pla <dig> inhibit ltm formation
to assess the impact of increased levels of extracellular pla <dig> on the formation of appetitive ltm, animals randomly assigned to two test groups were injected with pla <dig> from bee venom or vehicle-only 1 hr before their first training session. animals were subsequently tested for the presence of conditioned feeding responses 22–24 hrs after their last training session . these experiments revealed a prominent suppression of conditioned feeding responses in animals that received treatment with pla <dig> . that is, vehicle-injected conditioned  animals displayed robust conditioned feeding responses compared to their non-conditioned  peers . in contrast, pla2-injected animals displayed a conditioned feeding response that was significantly reduced compared to the vehicle conditioned animals  and was statistically indistinguishable from their non-conditioned partners .

aaph injection elevates circulating ffa levels and causes pla2-dependent ltm failure
prior studies in l. stagnalis implicate natural and experimentally  induced non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation to memory deficiencies in an aversive operant conditioning of aerial respiratory behaviour
 <cit> . we also demonstrated this phenomenon can be fully reversed through treatment with the general pla <dig> inhibitor aristolochic acid
 <cit> . therefore, we now proceed with testing whether aaph treatment also affect non-aversive appetitive classical conditioning. to this end, we first evaluated the temporal characteristics of aaph induced free fatty acid  release into the circulatory system. ffa content of haemolymph extracted immediately or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 168 hours after intracoelomic injection of aaph were quantified with adifab-ffa assay. a significant increase in haemolymph ffa levels developed over the first 24– <dig> hours after aaph injection . no such increase was observed when haemolymph was collected 24 hrs after vehicle injection . ffa levels returned to control levels 2– <dig> days after aaph injection. these data support the notion that aaph injection can cause significant temporal changes in lipid metabolism within the whole animal.

next we tested the effect of aaph induced oxidative stress on non-aversive appetitive classical conditioning and the involvement of pla <dig> in this process. to this end animals were injected 24 hrs before the first training trial with either vehicle or aaph. subsequently, animals were injected 1 hr before the start of the first training session with either aristolochic acid or vehicle only . we found that treatment with aaph caused a significant reduction in the conditioned feeding response and that treatment with the pla <dig> inhibitor aristolochic acid counteracted aaph’s negative effect on ltm formation . that is, aaph treated animals had a lowered feeding response compared to vehicle treated conditioned animals  and their response was statistically indistinguishable from the non-conditioned peers . in contrast animals treated with aristolochic acid only learned well  in a manner that was statistically indistinguishable from that of vehicle treated animals . moreover, animals treated with the combination of aaph and aristolochic acid did display a significant conditioned feeding response  that was significantly different from the aaph injected animals . note that training and testing trials were performed when aaph-induced haemolymph ffa levels were at or close to their peak.

arachidonic acid does not affect ltm performance
the above results clearly implicate pla <dig> as a critical factor in oxidative stress induced appetitive ltm deficiency. pla <dig> is responsible for the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids resulting in the release of ffas including arachidonic acid as one of its most prominent products. arachidonic acid is the primary substrate for the cyclooxygenase  branch of the eicosanoid pathway. we previously showed that systemic immune challenges cause oxidative stress and induces a pla2- and cox-dependent appetitive ltm failure in l. stagnalis <cit> . thus, to test the hypothesis that elevated haemolymph arachidonic acid levels underlie ltm impairment, animals were injected with exogenous arachidonic acid or vehicle-only before their first training session and tested for the presence of conditioned feeding responses 22–24 hrs after their last training session . these experiments revealed no significant negative effect of arachidonic acid injection on appetitive ltm .

binding of free fatty acids to bsa does not rescue ltm failure
above we showed that injection with exogenous arachidonic acid prior to training has no effect on appetitive ltm function. however, arachidonic acid is likely not the only pla2-hydrolysis product released with neuromodulatory or signaling capabilities. defatted bovine serum albumin  is considered a high affinity ffa binding protein
 <cit> . thus, we first verified whether bsa is an effective tool for haemolymph ffa manipulation in l. stagnalis. animals were injected with aaph or vehicle-only and 24 hrs later subsequently injected with defatted bsa or vehicle-only. two hours after bsa injections, haemolymph was collected and ffa levels were determined immediately using the adifab assay. as before, aaph injection induced elevated haemolymph ffa . moreover our data showed that bsa effectively binds ffas in l. stagnalis haemolymph. that is, naturally occurring ffas levels are significantly lower after bsa injection  and animals subjected to injections of both aaph and bsa have similar haemolymph ffa levels as vehicle-only injected animals .

next we tested whether bsa-injection could reverse aaph induced appetitive ltm failure. animals were injected with aaph or vehicle-only 24 hrs before training and subsequently injected 1 hr before training with defatted bsa or vehicle . we found that injection with bsa did not counter aaph’s negative effect on ltm formation . as before, treatment with aaph caused a significant reduction in the conditioned feeding response compared to vehicle treated conditioned animals . in contrast, animals treated with bsa-only learned well  in a manner that was statistically indistinguishable from that of vehicle treated conditioned animals . however, animals treated with the combination of aaph + bsa did not display a significant conditioned feeding response . this conditioned feeding response was different compared to vehicle or bsa treated conditioned animals  but not significantly different from the aaph-only injected animals .

discussion
this study’s primary purpose was to test the hypothesis that ffas released by oxidative stress-induced pla <dig> activity are a factor in learning and memory dysfunction in l. stagnalis. our primary observations are: 1- increasing the level of extracellular pla <dig> activity through injection of venom-derived extracellular pla <dig> evoked ltm impairment. 2- experimental induction of oxidative stress with the lipid peroxidation-inducing free radical generator aaph triggers an increase in circulating ffa levels that peaks within 24–48 hrs and attenuates ltm performance. 3- experimental elevation of circulating arachidonic acid through intracoelomic injection of exogenous arachidonic acid does not affect ltm performance.  <dig>  experimentally induced oxidative stress-associated ltm impairment can be rescued with the general pla <dig> inhibitor aristolochic acid but not by normalizing the level of circulating ffas with defatted bsa.

the present data substantiate previous evidence where we link lipid peroxidation and pla <dig> activation to age- and oxidative stress-associated ltm impairment in another, aversive operant conditioning learning and memory paradigm
 <cit> . in both our learning models age- and oxidative stress associated ltm failure is associated with reduced electrical excitability of key interneurons in the circuits underlying the respective behaviours
 <cit> . both behavioural and electrophysiological facets of age-associated respiratory and appetitive ltm impairment can be reproduced in young animals through treatment with aaph, a water-soluble free radical generator commonly used to induce fa peroxidation . in addition, in both our two models, all behavioural, electrophysiological and biochemical symptoms of aging and experimental oxidative stress can be reversed by treatment with aristolochic acid, a broad spectrum pla <dig> inhibitor . no evidence was found of significant age-associated impairment or experimental oxidative stress-induced repression of short/intermediate term forms in either of the two behavioural conditioning paradigms
 <cit> , suggesting that transcription-independent forms of memory are relatively impervious to aging or oxidative stress. intriguingly, selective appetitive ltm impairment could also be induced in young lymnaea through systemic activation of their cellular immune system and, as before in aged and oxidation-stressed young animals, ltm could be rescued by means of pla <dig> inhibition
 <cit> . thus, although, the possibility exists that the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress induced pla <dig> activation dependent ltm impairments in our two learning models are different, this seems unlikely. the brain and its neurons are due to their high polyunsaturated fatty acids  content inordinately sensitive to free radical attack, oxidative stress and subsequent peroxidation, a process that if not properly contained can severely disrupt membrane architecture and lipid signaling processes
 <cit> . neurons defend themselves against lipid-peroxidation through various mechanisms, one that involves excision of oxidized fa by pla <dig> <cit> . as will be discussed below, pla <dig>  oxidized fa and their various metabolites all can alter signal transduction, various neuronal signaling pathways, ion channel functioning and gene transcription processes and ultimately behavioral plasticity such as learning and memory processes. thus, although to our knowledge our studies are the first to show these aspects in molluscs, it is not surprisingly that similar conclusions are drawn with increasing frequency in studies linking oxidative stress related pla <dig> activation with cognitive impairment, neuronal dysfunction and disease not only in other, non-molluscan, invertebrate species but also in mammals and humans
 <cit> . together this suggests that lymnaea’s ltm functions in general are sensitive to lipid peroxidation and oxidative membrane damage, and that lipid peroxidation-dependent activation of pla <dig> is a fundamental and evolutionary conserved factor in the decline in behavioral and neuronal plasticity widely observed across the animal kingdom.

activation of pla <dig> by reactive oxygen species in l. stagnalis results in the release of extracellular oxidized ffas . many ffas, including aa and dha the two fas most commonly found at the glycerophospholipid sn- <dig> position in neurons, have various demonstrated biological activity in the nervous system. for instance, under normal conditions they can regulate membrane fluidity and other aspects of phospholipid membrane microarchitecture, may engage in modulatory interactions with various ion channels, affect alterations in membrane protein clustering, modify receptor sensitivity and signal transduction pathways as well as affect gene transcription processes
 <cit> . however, under conditions of oxidative stress, causes  activation of pla <dig> resulting in peroxidized fa excision from the lipid bilayer matrix
 <cit> . recent evidence increasingly associates deregulation of lipid metabolism due to pla <dig>  activation as a cause of nervous system dysfunction and cognitive impairment
 <cit> . in addition, aa is the substrate for many potentially neuroactive lipids metabolized including those generated by the eicosanoid metabolic pathways. each of the three main branches of eicosanoid metabolism, the epoxygenase or cyp- <dig>  the lipoxygenase  and the cyclooxygenase  pathways, has the potential to generate a variety of lipid-derived neuromodulatory substances that may engage with either intracellular or extracellular targets
 <cit> . in addition, oxidized ffas can undergo further metabolic processing resulting in the production of highly cytotoxic aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde
 <cit> .

interestingly, we recently showed that challenging the immune system impairs ltm function in l. stagnalis that seems to involve pla <dig> and cox activity
 <cit> . in addition, non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation , has been shown to result in the production of aa and dha derived iso- and neuroprostanes including the lox series
 <cit> . pla2- and/or lox-dependent arachidonic-acid modulated background k+ channels have been described in lymnaea and various other molluscs
 <cit> . opening of these 4tm2p channels generates an outward current. it is therefore conceivable that elevated levels of pla2-activity associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and aging induce a decline in neuronal excitability through activation of these 4tm2p background k+ channels. in this respect the 12-lox product 12-hpete, first described in the gastropod aplysia californica, is quite interesting. 12-hpete has long been known as an activator of aplysia’s s-type k+-channels
 <cit> . these k+ channels, later identified to belong to the trek- <dig> family, are instrumental in non-synaptic forms of plasticity underlying behavioral modification of aplysia’s gill withdrawal reflex
 <cit>  and are implicated as synaptic modulator in aplysia and various vertebrate model systems
 <cit> . alterations in receptor sensitivity, ion channels and signal transduction pathways as well as affect gene transcription by pla <dig>  it’s products and their metabolites will most likely affect activity,- transcription- and protein synthesis-dependent processes such as ltm formation.

based on the evidence described above it seems therefore very plausible that lipid-peroxidation evoked elevated levels of ffas through activation of pla <dig> are the source of the observed ltm dysfunction in l. stagnalis . however, in the present study we show that increasing extracellular levels of aa does not affect ltm performance in l. stagnalis. moreover, we also show in the current study that removing aaph-induced elevated levels of circulating peroxidized ffa with bsa does not rescue ltm failure in our model system.

so, if not extracellular ffas then what might be a source of the lipid-peroxidation dependent ltm failure observed in l. stagnalis? the first possibility is that pla <dig> itself is the main culprit. the pla <dig> family is a family of heterogeneous enzymes acting in different cellular locations and to some extent different activation profiles usually classified into intracellular located cytosolic pla <dig> , calcium-independent pla <dig> , extracellular acting secretory pla <dig>  and the recently identified lysosomal and adipose-specific pla2’s
 <cit> . upon activation, the various pla <dig> family members such as cpla <dig> and spla <dig> can induce fa release and eicosanoid production by themselves
 <cit> . in addition, recent evidence also indicates the existence of cross-talk and trans-activation between the various intracellular and cytosolic pla <dig> family members
 <cit> . thus it is quite conceivable that aaph, a water-soluble extracellular free radical generator used to induce lipid peroxidation in the present study activates various intracellular and extracellular pla <dig> enzymes.

besides being present and acting on the cellular plasmamembrane both cpla <dig> and ipla <dig> can localize and/or target organellar membranes including mitochondrial and nuclear membranes
 <cit> . for instance, it has been shown that activation of pla <dig> can induce mitochondrial dysfunction due to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, swelling of mitochondria and/or the production of superoxide from mitochondria
 <cit> . furthermore, interactions between cpla <dig> and nadph-oxidase complexes in the plasmamembrane have been implicated in the redox-pathology of various neurodegenerative diseases
 <cit> . in addition to their potential interference with numerous signaling processes, pla <dig> enzymatic activity may impact various membrane architecture-sensitive processes. for example, pla <dig> may alter phospholipid-packing causing membranes to become more molecularly ordered and affect processes involved in vesicle fusion, exocytosis and actin-dependent processes
 <cit> . moreover, there is evidence that architectural changes induced by pla <dig> may alter gating states for a variety of ion channels including members of the k2p two-pore “leak” potassium family
 <cit> . at this point in time we cannot say if and which of these scenarios underpins ltm impairment in our model system. nor can we pinpoint which pla <dig> is involved. however, the observation in the current and one of our previous studies
 <cit> , that treatment with aristolochic acid, commonly considered a general pla <dig> inhibitor and inhibiting various classes of pla <dig> <cit> , reverses the aaph-induced ltm failure is consistent with pla2’s involvement.

another intriguing potential scenario to consider as explanation for the current results is the possibility that other products released extracellular after pla <dig> activation are causing ltm failure in l. stagnalis. for instance, hydrolysis of oxidized membrane phospholipids by pla <dig> will not only liberate ffas but also produce lysophospholipids . involvement of lpls in membrane-associated processes such as membrane budding, ruffle formation, protein complex assembly and ion channel gating has been reported
 <cit> . however, extracellular lpls, like ffas, can bind to bsa
 <cit> . therefore, we currently interpret bsa’s inability to reverse aaph-induced ltm deficiency as evidence against the idea that circulating lpls play a major role in the current ltm failure model. alternatively, extracellular oxidized fas can undergo further metabolic processing resulting in the production of highly cytotoxic aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde
 <cit> . it is important to note that bsa is not cell permeable. thus, indirect activation of intracellular pla <dig> might cause elevated levels of intracellular ffas and lpls thereby affecting various intracellular targets
 <cit> . for instance, it has been demonstrated that increased levels of intracellular ffas can directly affect nadph-oxidase
 <cit>  resulting in a further increase of ros and lipid peroxidation
 <cit> .

in addition to ffas and lpls, pla <dig> activation results in the extracellular release of lyso-platelet-activating factor , the platelet-activating factor  precursor
 <cit> . paf is a bioactive phospholipid that under normal conditions is thought to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, memory and neuronal protection
 <cit> . in addition, paf is a transcriptional activator of the cyclooxygenase- <dig>  gene
 <cit> . as noted before, aa is the primary substrate for the cox branch of the eicosanoid  pathway. importantly, ros can also be generated as a by-product of cox activity, thus creating a positive feedback loop that potentially can cause escalation of pla <dig>  paf and cox-activity thereby causing substantive deregulation of lipid homeostasis
 <cit> . in this respect it is interesting to note that we recently showed that systemic immune challenges in l. stagnalis induces a pla2-dependent ltm failure that could be rescued with treatment of indomethacin, a putative cox inhibitor
 <cit> .

one of the intriguing questions still remaining is why inhibition of pla <dig> 24 hrs after its activation is sufficient to reverse the oxidative stress induced ltm failure? we show in the present study that circulating ffa levels are their highest level 24–48 hrs after pla <dig> activation suggesting that some of the pla <dig> and ffa-dependent and associated pathways are initiated in the first 24 hrs. after induction of oxidative stress. at present we cannot definitively provide a mechanism to what causes the pla2-dependent ltm failure within this time frame. however based on the actions of pla <dig>  ffa and their various products as outlined above there are some potential explanations. for instance, it is conceivable that by inhibiting pla <dig> activity, even though ffas are already released for some time, we stop the positive feedback loop discussed above, thereby preventing further escalation of pla <dig>  its products and their pathways. notwithstanding, further investigations are clearly needed to resolve this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
the current results support our earlier work where we link oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and age-associated ltm impairment in l. stagnalis. in the present study, we provide evidence that lipid peroxidation induced elevated levels of circulating ffa do not impact ltm performance. this is of particularly interest considering the increasing focus on the interplay between ros, pla <dig>  cox, their substrates and metabolites as a potential factor in the deregulation of lipid metabolism and cell- and neuronal dysfunction and cognitive performance.
