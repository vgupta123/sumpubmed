BACKGROUND
the nelumbonaceae is a perennial, aquatic plant family, which comprises only one genus, nelumbo, consisting of two species: chinese lotus n. nucifera gaertn  and american lotus n. lutea pers   <cit> . lotus is a diploid plant  with agricultural, medicinal, and ecological significance. chinese lotus  is cultivated for its edible rhizomes, seeds, and leaves, which have been consumed as food for thousands of years in asia. nearly all parts of lotus have been used as herbal medicines to treat cancer, depression, diarrhea, heart problems, hypertension, insomnia, pyrexia, and obesity . lotus has been shown to be an effective phytoremediator, playing a critical role in removal of heavy metals from polluted water  <cit> . n. nucifera ‘chinese antique’ and n. lutea ‘al1’ are geographically isolated and have distinct morphological traits  <cit> . american lotus has been used to transfer desirable ornamental flower traits to chinese lotus germplasm.

despite the agricultural and medicinal importance of lotus, only limited genetic resources are available for genome analysis and molecular breeding. in recent years, a range of dna markers have been developed for assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in lotus, including simple sequence repeats   <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeats   <cit> , sequence-related amplified polymorphisms   <cit>  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms   <cit> . these resources are inadequate for comparative genomics and analysis of quantitative trait loci . genetic linkage maps are an essential resource for studies on genome structure, genome evolution, and for identification of mendelian components of qtls  <cit> .

two genetic maps was constructed based on ssr markers using an f <dig> population derived from a cross between ‘chinese lotus’ and ‘american lotus’  <cit> . however, the resulting genetic maps of these two parents consist of  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively. these are the first genetic maps of lotus, and the sequence based ssrs make them a good resource for genome assembly. however, for a genome sequencing project, a much higher density genetic map with sequence-tagged markers is necessary to anchor scaffolds on linkage groups or chromosomes.

single nucleotide polymorphism  markers have become the marker system of choice because of the high abundance of source polymorphisms in genome sequences and the automation of allele calling  <cit> . to generate high-density genetic maps, automated high-throughput, low-cost new technologies for molecular marker genotyping are required. recently, a significant advance in genotyping using restriction-site associated dna sequencing , has allowed rapid discovery of thousands of snps and indel markers, and high throughput genotyping of large populations  <cit> . restriction-site associated dna sequencing has been effectively applied in genetic mapping and qtls analyses in eggplant  <cit> , barley  <cit> , cynara cardunculus <cit> , lolium perenne <cit> , grape  <cit>  and other plants.

radseq markers are high throughput and cost effective for genetic mapping. however, scoring radseq markers presents a computational challenge, and a range of reference sequences can be used. one of our objectives is to identify optimal reference sequences for scoring radseq markers. in the absence of a draft genome assembly, the most common references currently are either parental reads assembled to form clusters or gene models. parental radseq tags have been assembled into clusters and used as references for assigning offspring genotypes in plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> . alternatively, gene models from a closely related species can be used as references for scoring radseq markers in barley  <cit> . both of these approaches have shortcomings which limit the number of callable markers. homologous clusters can be repetitive and lead to erroneous marker calling and gene models can exclude single copy non-coding regions. a draft genome sequence provides the best reference  <cit> , but still produces a range of various quality markers depending on the input sequence. few research on employing repeat masked genome as reference in radseq marker discovery was reported.

here, we report the construction of two high-resolution genetic linkage maps for lotus using radseq markers and a segregating f <dig> population crossed between nelumbo nucifera ‘chinese antique’ and n. lutea ‘al1’, the same mapping population used for linkage mapping with ssr markers  <cit> . we tested multiple strategies for scoring radseq markers and selected the optimal one for constructing a high density genetic map of ‘al1’ and a low density map of ‘chinese antique’ due to extremely low heterozygosity within the genome. the ‘al1’ genetic map was used for genome assembly of the lotus genome and anchored 68% of the assembled genome  <cit> . the genetic map will facilitate the identification of genes controlling horticultural, medicinal, and ornamental traits, and provide a reference for large-scale re-sequencing projects.

RESULTS
radseq tag sequencing and marker development
radseq libraries were sequenced using illumina hiseq <dig>  generating a total of  <dig> million 100 bp reads. after sorting reads by f <dig> individuals, sequences were trimmed to 92 bp to remove the 4–8 bp illumina barcode sequences. low quality reads , and ambiguous reads with incorrect barcodes were excluded, leaving  <dig>  million reads for further analysis. of these high-quality reads,  <dig>  million reads were from female parent n. nucifera ‘chinese antique’, and  <dig>  million reads were from the male parent n. lutea ‘al1’. the number of reads per f <dig> individuals varied from  <dig>  million to  <dig>  million, with an average read number of  <dig>  million per progeny.

reads were aligned into clusters with the repeat masked megascaffolds as a reference for map construction after comparative analysis of three sets of references , where clusters with less than  <dig> or more than  <dig> sequences were discarded to avoid misidentification of polymorphisms due to low coverage or highly repetitive regions respectively. finally,  <dig>  clusters presented more than one genotype in the f <dig> population, with an average coverage of  <dig> × for polymorphic loci at the population level. of the  <dig>  polymorphic loci,  <dig>  represent homologous loci in ‘china antique’ and heterozygous loci in ‘al1’, while  <dig>  were homozygous for ‘al1’ and heterozygous for ‘china antique’. however, only  <dig> loci that could be assigned to both maternal and paternal maps were detected, accounting for 2% of all polymorphic loci.

despite a relative high average coverage for polymorphic radseq clusters, many radseq clusters have low coverage in some f <dig> plants. to avoid the errors in data analysis, only tag clusters showing three or more fold coverage of > 90% of all f <dig> individuals were selected. in addition, for controlling marker quality, the missing ratio per potential marker was calculated in the f <dig> population, and the markers with more than 90% integrity were retained. radseq markers in testcross and intercross configurations are expected to segregate 1: <dig> and 1:2: <dig>  respectively, markers displaying a segregation distortion  were excluded from analysis.

optimizing linkage mapping strategy using sequence based markers
an important consideration for calling radseq markers is the reference sequences used for marker identification. to identify the most effective reference sequences, unmasked scaffolds, the repeat masked scaffolds, and gene models were used as references to call radseq markers for map construction. the number of scored markers is the highest with unmasked scaffolds, moderate with repeat masked scaffolds, and lowest with gene models at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> markers respectively. however, the percentage of markers anchored to the top  <dig> megascaffolds  is the highest with repeat masked scaffolds, moderate with gene models, and lowest with unmasked scaffolds at 88%, 75%, 65%, respectively, reflecting the accuracy of genetic maps with markers scored using three different references .table  <dig>

the distribution of anchored markers on the scaffolds also provides valuable information for assessing the quality of linkage maps using each of the three sets of references for scoring markers. for the linkage map constructed using the unmasked scaffolds as a reference, each megascaffold anchored markers from multiple linkage groups, and megascaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> anchored markers from all  <dig> linkage groups. each scaffold anchored vast majority of markers from one linkage group using the repeat masked scaffolds as a reference, except megascaffold  <dig>  and the same pattern was observed for linkage map constructed using unmasked scaffolds as references, except megascaffold  <dig> . on megascaffold  <dig>  for markers derived from the unmasked genome,  <dig> anchored markers were mapped to linkage group   <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> markers mapped to lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. for markers derived from gene models,  <dig> anchored markers mapped to lg <dig> and  <dig> markers mapped to lg <dig>  and for markers derived from the repeat masked genome,  <dig> anchored markers mapped to lg <dig> with less than  <dig> markers mapped to other lgs. on megascaffold  <dig>   <dig> markers mapped to lg  <dig> using the unmasked genome, and  <dig> markers mapped to other  <dig> lgs compared to the repeat masked genome where  <dig> anchored markers mapped to lg <dig> and only  <dig> markers mapped to other  <dig> lgs. each of the  <dig> lgs derived from using the repeat masked genome as a reference anchored to one scaffolds unambiguously, cleaner than the other two linkage maps using unmasked genome and gene models as references . for this reason, we report the linkage maps constructed with markers scored using the repeat masked genome as a reference in the following section.table  <dig>

deriving markers from the gene models eliminates errors due to repetitive sequences but is still problematic because of multicopy genes. multicopy genes are likely responsible for the high number of mismatched markers on megascaffold  <dig>  where  <dig> markers map correctly on lg <dig> and  <dig> markers map on lg <dig> . these errors in megascaffold  <dig> can also be seen in markers derived from the unmasked genome,  <dig> markers map correctly to lg <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> markers map incorrectly to lg <dig> and lg <dig> respectively. using the repeat masked genome as a reference eliminated this problem, as  <dig> markers map to lg <dig> with less than  <dig> markers mapping to the other lgs. a reduction of erroneous markers in the repeat masked markers compared to the unmasked and gene model markers can be seen in the other  <dig> megascaffolds . megascaffold  <dig> for instance has  <dig> markers correctly mapping to lg  <dig> using the unmasked genome as a reference, but also has  <dig> markers in the other lgs. the repeat masked megascaffold  <dig> has  <dig> correct markers and only  <dig> erroneous markers. a set of makers aligned to the repeat masked scaffold produced the optimal genetic maps likely because of reduce erroneous marker detection caused by high copy number repetitive elements.

genetic maps
of the  <dig>  potential radseq markers,  <dig>  markers were scored and sorted into  <dig> recombination bins for constructing the male parental  genetic map. comparatively fewer markers were identified in the ‘chinese antique’ genetic map, only  <dig> of the  <dig>  potential loci were scored.

a total of  <dig>  markers, including  <dig> lotus ssr markers  <cit>  and  <dig>  radseq markers were used to construct the american lotus genetic map. the  <dig>  radseq markers were assigned to  <dig> recombination bins, of which  <dig> bins  were integrated with  <dig> ssr markers to construct the american lotus genetic map. with a lod threshold of  <dig>  and a recombination frequency of  <dig> , the regression mapping algorithm in joinmap  <dig>  grouped  <dig> bins and  <dig> ssr markers into  <dig> linkage groups . the number of linkage groups is close to the haploid chromosome number of  <dig> in lotus, suggesting one chromosome spans into two linkage groups. the total length of the american lotus genetic map is  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers/bins. linkage groups have a wide variation in size; the longest linkage group is  <dig>  cm, while the shortest is  <dig>  cm. the number of markers in each lg varies from  <dig> in lg <dig> to  <dig> in lg <dig>  lg  <dig> has the highest density of markers with an average interval of  <dig>  cm. integration of the previously reported ssrs with the high density radseq markers joined two of the linkage groups reported in yang et al.,  <dig> and  <dig> ssr markers are common between the two ‘al1’ genetic maps. lg1-m and lg4-m from the ssr based map were integrated into lg <dig> in our radseq based american lotus map. most markers are collinear between the maps, which enables us to identify corresponding lgs and detect saturated regions. for instance, there are  <dig> markers  in the ssr based lg5-m, of which  <dig> ssr markers are shared in the radseq map. marker order between lg5-m and the corresponding radseq lg <dig> is conserved except for ssr079e-s <dig> and ssr079d-s <dig> . marker density is significantly higher in radseq lg <dig> with an added  <dig> radseq markers, increasing the map resolution.figure  <dig>

very few heterozygous loci in ‘china antique’ were detected in radseq tags. the dataset consisting of  <dig> ssr markers and only  <dig> radseq markers was used to construct the female chinese lotus genetic map. ninety six markers  were mapped into  <dig> linkage groups . the total length of the chinese lotus genetic map is  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers, much higher than the american lotus map. the chinese lotus linkage map is an improvement of the ssr based map. for instance, the ssr based lg5-f included only  <dig> ssr markers, where the corresponding radseq based lg <dig> extended to  <dig>  cm with  <dig> radseq markers. the low marker density in the chinese lotus genetic map is due to unexpectedly low level of heterozygosity within the genome of ‘chinese antique’. heterozygosity was estimated by aligning the whole genome shotgun reads from the lotus genome sequencing project to the  <dig> megascaffold sequences. the genome has an average density of  <dig>  snp/indels per kb  with a non-uniform snp distribution . this residual heterozygosity of american lotus genome is  <dig> %,  <dig> times that of american lotus  <cit> .figure  <dig>

application in genome assembly
the genome of the lotus variety ‘china antique’ was sequenced with  <dig>  gb  illumina and  <dig>  gb   <dig> sequences, and the final assembly spans 804 mb, 87% of the estimated 929 mb lotus genome  <cit> . the well assembled lotus genome is largely due to the unexpected homozygosity of the ‘china antique’ variety. because of an insufficient number of radseq markers from ‘china antique’, only the high-density american lotus genetic map was used to anchor scaffold sequences and produce a chromosome sized assembly. the  <dig> anchored scaffolds span  <dig>  mb, accounting for 68% of the assembled genome . in total, 88% of the markers in the american lotus linkage map could be anchored to the genome sequences. the relationship of genetic map and physical map was  <dig>  mb/cm.table  <dig> 
summary of mapping statistics for aiding the chinese lotus genome assembly




the 43 mb megascaffold  <dig> anchored merely  <dig> markers in three bins compared to several hundred markers in each of the other scaffolds. despite the few mapped markers, megascaffold  <dig> has a relatively normal polymorphism density comparable to the rest of the genome , ruling out homology by decent as the cause. the low marker density of megascaffold  <dig> must be attributed to other factors.

discussion
the unmasked genome provided the largest number of markers but the lowest quality map, with over 15% of the markers anchored to incorrect scaffolds. these erroneous markers are likely repetitive sequences with multiple matches in the genome. using gene models as a reference produced less than 10% markers compared to those using unmasked genome as a reference , and it produced two broken linkage groups and 12% erroneous markers. this low density map is missing most of the informative radseq markers has little utility for marker assisted breeding or qtl analysis. the repeat masked genome provided the highest quality map with only 2% markers anchored to different scaffolds. it is unclear whether these 2% of markers are missing calls from linkage mapping, errors in genome assembly, or more likely a combination of both. together this suggests most informative radseq markers are located in single copy non-coding regions or within introns with relatively few found in the coding regions. a significant number of markers are also found in repetitive regions, but inclusion of these markers leads to incorrect genotype calling and subsequent errors in mapping.

the assembled draft genome of sacred lotus consists of 804 mb with 57% repetitive sequences, and the  <dig>  gene models accounted about 40 mb, about 5% of the unmasked genome  <cit> . however, the scored radseq markers using gene models as references are close to 9% the markers using unmasked genome as a reference, roughly twice as many as expected since gene models account for 5% of the assembled genome. the polymorphism rate in the genic regions should be lower than that of non-coding and repetitive sequences. the higher percentage of scored markers from the coding sequence is likely the result of misalignment of repetitive sequences causing incorrect scoring and skewed distribution. the repeat masked genome account for 43% of the assembled genome, but the scored markers are 48% those scored from unmasked genome, for the same reason. our conclusion is that the optimal reference sequences for scoring radseq markers for linkage mapping is the repeat masked draft genome, not the unmasked genome, and not the gene models.

alignment against the unmasked genome produced significantly more markers  but only 65% mapped into lgs and a large number were unlinked or erroneous. alignment against the gene models produced comparatively fewer markers  with 75% markers mapped, likely due to lower marker density. the repeat masked genome yielded the highest percentage of mapped markers, at 88%, strengthen the notion that the repeat masked genome is the best reference for calling radseq markers. using the unmasked genome as a reference is problematic because mis-scoring could occur in heterochromatic regions with abundant repetitive sequences, leading to subsequently errors in mapping. using gene models as references would eliminate all markers in non-genic regions, which account for a vast majority of the 804 mb assembled genome, resulting in an insufficient number of markers for constructing a saturated genetic map and for assisting genome assembly.

the relatively low marker density observed in ‘chinese antique’ is likely a consequence of its unexpectedly high level genome homozygosity. the estimated heterozygosity of ‘china antique’ is  <dig> %, much lower than the heterozygosity of american lotus ‘al1’ which is twelve fold higher at  <dig> %. although lotus is an out-crossing plant, its cultivation and vegetative propagation via rhizomes over the past  <dig>  years may have imposed a narrow genetic background  <cit> . the exceptional seed longevity observed in lotus might have further reduced the number of generations in its evolutionary history in addition to vegetative propagation. on the other hand, regions of low diversity may be explained by the smaller effective population size  <cit> . population sizes are usually too small to detect variation between two loci. all possible genotypes for two loci must appear in the population in sufficient frequencies to allow statistical analysis  <cit> . the relatively fewer markers detected in chinese lotus were possibly attributed to a smaller population size, though the relatively high-resolution genetic maps were constructed.

though  <dig>  radseq markers and  <dig> ssr markers were mapped in the american lotus genetic map, the  <dig> linkage groups didn’t match the  <dig> chromosomes of the haploid genome, indicating that two lgs in the ‘al1’ map come from one chromosome, but remain divided because of a large interval between the two linkage groups. compared to the previous lotus genetic maps, the american lotus map presented here has a longer map distance, and higher marker density, with around  <dig> folds more markers. two linkage groups  in the previously reported ssr map  <cit>  were integrated into one linkage group  in america lotus maps because of the increasing marker number. the chinese lotus genetic maps have an additional lg not found in the ssr maps, therefore the number of female genetic maps was consistent with that of the haploid chromosomes. the radseq genetic maps improved the saturation and resolution compare to the previous lotus genetic maps, and provide a valid tool for genome research and crop improvement.

the american lotus genetic map was used to anchor the scaffold sequences of the lotus draft genome. the draft assembly spans 804 mb, 87% of the total estimated genome size of 929 mb  <cit> , with a scaffold n <dig> of  <dig>  mbp before marker anchoring.  <dig>  radseq markers anchored  <dig> individual scaffold sequences into  <dig> megascaffolds with sizes roughly proportional to the lotus karyotype  <cit> . furthermore, the high density markers and large scaffolds allowed for the orientation of most scaffolds in the genetic map. integration of the genetic map and scaffold sequences resulted in a physical distance of  <dig>  mb/cm.

the high density lotus genetic map provides a framework for marker assisted breeding and qtl analysis. several excellent traits exist in the two parents, for example plant size, leaf shape, petal shape and color  <cit> . thus, a given trait might be improved by selection of markers which are linked to elite loci or alleles after qtl detection. nuciferine, the main bioactive constituent of alkaloids in lotus leaves, is a key lipid-lowering substance. recently, we detected significant variation in nuciferine content between nelumbo nucifera ‘china antique’  and n. lutea ‘al1’ . mapping quantitative trait loci of nuciferine content based on high-density lotus genetic map is essential to guide molecular breeding of lotus cultivars with high nuciferine content. moreover, several excellent traits might be combined in one lotus plant, thereby producing a new cultivar, through a series of crosses and marker-assisted selection . in addition, the radseq markers could be used as shared anchors to compare genetic and physical maps. the high density genetic maps presented here can facilitate comparative genomic analysis, genome assembly, qtls analysis and molecular assisted breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identify the optimal reference sequence for scoring radseq markers using the unmasked scaffolds, repeat masked scaffolds, and gene models as references. the repeat masked genome provided the highest quality map as a reference with the highest accuracy rate. the unmasked genome provided the largest number of markers but the lowest quality map, which is likely due to repetitive sequences with multiple matches in the genome. using gene models as a reference produced the least markers compared to those of unmasked genome and repeat masked sequences, and generated low density map because of missing most of the informative radseq markers.

the high density genetic map of american lotus was constructed with  <dig> bins  integrating with  <dig> ssr markers. the total length of the american lotus genetic map is  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers/bins. the relatively low marker density observed in ‘chinese antique’ is likely a consequence of its unexpectedly high level genome homozygosity. the high density genetic maps significantly improved the saturation and resolution compare to the previous lotus genetic maps, and facilitated genome research and crop improvement.
