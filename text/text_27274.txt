BACKGROUND
neural stem cells , which have properties of self-renewal and differentiation into neurons and glias, are usually isolated from fetal and adult brains in the form of floating clonal derivatives of the nscs placed in culture, known as neurospheres   <cit> . nscs have the potential to be used in cell replacement therapy for neural disorders such as parkinson's disease and alzheimer's disease as well as other neurological disorders including spinal cord injuries  <cit> . for therapy, maintenance and expansion of the nscs are necessary to provide sufficient amount of cells for patients to be treated.

human nscs can be obtained from brains and from human embryonic stem cells  by a step-wise differentiation procedure  <cit> , and such hesc-derived nscs are usually cultured as ns-like aggregates. however, the ns-like aggregates, also called neuroectodermal spheres , differ from the nss in that ness have a distinctive radial cluster of columnar epithelial cells, called a rosette  <cit> . the rosette resembles a developing neural tube and contains multipotential neuroprogenitor cells that have a similar expression profile as the neuroepithelial cells in the neural tube. analyses of microarray data revealed that brain-derived nscs and hesc-derived nscs were shown to express distinct groups of genes and, nonetheless, they did share many properties involving nsc markers  <cit> . in addition, the brain-derived nss generally exhibit specific regional markers along with dorso-ventral and antero-posterior axes and, of them, hesc-derived ness tend to preferentially express markers of anterior neural ectoderm  <cit> . together, ness might be assumed to mimic the pattern of in vivo neurogenesis to a degree  <cit> .

it is well known that notch signaling has a role in deciding cell fates during development  <cit> . with regard to neural development, notch signaling also has an important role in the maintenance of neural stem-cell features. notch <dig>  presenilins and rbp are key notch signaling molecules – a receptor, a regulator and a co-effector, respectively. in the fetal brains of notch1-/-, presenilins-/-, or rbp-jκ-/- mice, nsc levels were shown to be completely depleted  <cit> . also, inactivation of notch-regulated genes such as hes <dig> and hes <dig> induced a premature neuronal differentiation during brain development  <cit> . studies with presenilin-deficient mice have shown that notch signaling is necessary to maintain all nscs, regardless of their locations in the brain or age of the mouse  <cit> . several studies have provided important findings about the roles of notch signaling in neural development; unfortunately, however, most of these studies have investigated the nscs of mice or other laboratory animals rather than humans, mainly owing to the difficulties associated with obtaining human brain samples. therefore, information on human nscs is scarce, which prompted us to focus on neuroectodermal spheres  which are derived from human embryonic stem cell  and densely inhabited by nscs. hesc-derived nscs could possibly replace the rare human nscs  <cit> , which highlights the importance of the study to characterize the complicated, web-like molecular events, including notch signaling, that occur in the in vitro-produced ness.

in this study, we investigated the role of notch signaling in hesc-derived ness. we first verified that hesc-derived ness had features similar to neurospheres derived in vivo. we demonstrated that notch-related molecules were expressed at higher levels in the ness than in the hesc-derived embryoid bodies. furthermore, when notch signaling was inhibited by a specific inhibitor for the γ-secretase, the rosette folds were not visible, and the self-renewing activity and the proliferative potential were significantly reduced in the resulting ness. these observations indicate that notch signaling is active in the ness, and, to our knowledge, this, along with a recent paper by elkabetz et al.  <cit> , is the first description about the role of notch signaling in maintaining self-renewal of nscs derived from hescs.

RESULTS
derivation and characterization of neuroectodermal spheres from human embryonic stem cells
we derived ness containing neuroprogenitors from the hescs cha3-hescs  <cit>  and h <dig>  <cit> . figure 1a shows the procedure and timetable of nes preparation. we used a tissue chopper  <cit>  or embryonic stem cell divider   <cit>  to prepare embryoid bodies ; both of these approaches produce regular-sized, square clumps of hescs . these clumps were cultured in eb medium  for  <dig> days  and transferred to nes medium  to further differentiate into ness. neural rosettes, which are structures with neural tube-like folds and central cavities surrounded by rings of small columnar cells  <cit> , appeared about  <dig> days after the first subculture ). this was characteristic of ness .

the hesc-derived ness attached to the matrigel-coated culture dish were immunostained for neural stem cell  markers such as sox <dig>  pax <dig> and nestin. the rosettes of various sizes were positively stained for all these nsc markers . in addition, the hesc-derived ness were stained for a neuronal marker tuj <dig>  we found tuj1-positive neurites sporadically scattered around the boundaries of nes clumps. flow cytometry showed that more than 95% in both cha-hes3- and h9-derived ness were positively stained for the neural precursor cell surface marker psa-ncam  <cit> . when analyzed at the transcriptional level, the ness showed increased expression levels of nsc marker genes such as nes, msi <dig> and  <dig>  pax <dig>  vim, sox <dig>  and sox <dig>  whereas none of the mesoderm-lineage markers  or the endoderm-lineage markers  were transcribed in a nes-specific manner . the transcripts for the esc marker genes  oct <dig> and nanog, were undetectable in the ness. the expression patterns of these nsc markers are similar to recent reports; for example, pax <dig> expression continued in 7-day-old ebs, whereas sox <dig> expression began only after nes formation  <cit> . rt-pcr results showed that anterior cns markers such as foxg <dig> and otx <dig> were more expressed in the ness than mid-hindbrain markers such as pax <dig> and en <dig> and markers of posterior cns fate such as krox <dig> and hoxb <dig>  <cit>  . this result agreed with a recent report  <cit> , suggesting that in the absence of extrinsic patterning cue, ness acquire markers defining anterior cns identity. taken together, these morphological, immunocytochemical, and molecular-level results demonstrate that the hesc-derived ness are suitable as an in vitro model of human in vivo-derived neuroprogenitors.

components of notch signaling were up-regulated in hescs-derived ness
notch signaling has been proposed to maintain the property of neuroprogenitors obtained from brain samples  <cit> . to investigate the role of notch signaling in the ness, we first profiled expressions of notch signaling genes. rt-pcr was used to show that transcripts for receptors notch <dig>  notch <dig> and notch <dig> were present at slightly increased levels in the ness compared with hescs and eb . the notch ligands dll <dig>  dll <dig>  <cit>  and jag <dig>  <cit>  were abundantly expressed in the ness. however, the notch <dig> transcript was not detected either from hescs or ness ; this is in agreement with a previous report  <cit> . both hes <dig> and hes <dig>  which are regulated by notch signaling and involved in neurogenesis  <cit> , were markedly expressed in the ness; they were also expressed in undifferentiated hescs in a small amount as observed before . hey <dig> and hey <dig>  which are also regulated by notch signaling but are associated with vascular development  <cit> , were not preferentially expressed in the ness. mib <dig> and mib <dig>  <cit> , which are required for ligand activation, and psen <dig>  which is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase that cleaves notch receptor to release the major signal transmitter, notch intracellular domain   <cit> , were also shown to be expressed at high levels in the ness. expression of notch signaling molecules were also confirmed at the protein level. in agreement with the rt-pcr results, notch signaling pathway proteins such as jag <dig> and dll <dig> and nicd and the target gene products hes <dig> and hes <dig> were abundant in hesc-derived ness . when the attached ness were stained for jag <dig> or dll <dig>  each of which is a transmembrane notch ligand, jag <dig> and dll <dig> signals  were shown to be enriched in the rosettes and were at particularly high levels in the inner circle of the rosette structures, facing the luminal side . we also found that notch <dig> receptor was also localized at the luminal side of rosettes together with jag <dig>  and dll <dig> . it has been shown that jag <dig> specifically expressed neuroepithelial cells in apical termini of fetal brain  <cit> . the jag <dig> staining pattern was in agreement with n-cadherin signal and formed a belt- or adherens junction-like signal. in a similar vein, it was reported that in the ventricular zone, dll <dig> is linked with adherens junction through interaction with magi <dig> at the apical termini of processes to activate notch on neighboring cells in the developing central nervous system  <cit> . owing to the stacking property of the cells facing the luminal side of rosettes, it is difficult to find out whether both notch ligand and receptor are expressed within the same cells. nevertheless, it is worth to notice a recent study that both notch <dig> and dll <dig> co-existed in ependymal cells  <cit> . together, these findings indicate that notch signaling has a greater role in cellular function in the hesc-derived ness than in the hescs and ebs  <cit> . on the whole, the gene expression profile of the hesc-derived ness corresponded with the previously reported results using in vivo nscs  <cit> , which indicates that the neuroprogenitors in the ness/rosettes express many of the same genes that are expressed in neuroepithelial cells of the neural tube.

inhibition of notch signaling leads to a loss of the stem cell characteristics from the neuroectodermal spheres
after demonstrating that notch signaling is active in the ness, we investigated the potential role of notch signaling in the ness derived from hescs. we treated the ness with the notch signaling inhibitor, n--s-phenylglycine-t-butyl ester , which is known to specifically bind to presenilin- <dig>  and inhibit γ-secretase activity  <cit> . surprisingly, in both cha <dig> and h <dig> cell lines, the treatment with  <dig> μm dapt removed the rosette structures from most of the floating  and attached ness . the volume of floating ness after dapt treatment was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm3; ; n = 58), and this value was only 59% of the value of dmso control  . dapt treatment did not cause damages such as cell death, as evidenced by the observation that trypan-blue staining showed that the survival rates were almost equal between dmso only  and dapt  groups. considering that the rosette contains neuroprogenitor cells reside  <cit> , the reduced numbers of rosette structure in the ness after treatment with a notch inhibitor could indicate a reduction in the neuroprogenitor population. in agreement with this, rt-pcr results from the dapt-treated ness derived from both hesc cell lines showed a marked reduction in the expression levels of various nsc marker genes and notch-regulated target genes such as hes <dig> and hes <dig> . ngn <dig>  which is suppressed by hes <dig> expression, were de-repressed in the dapt-treated ness in both cha <dig> and h <dig> hescs. mash <dig> is another target gene that is negatively regulated by hes <dig>  but its de-repression after dapt treatment was not as immediate as that of ngn <dig> 

to assess the proliferating capacity of neuroprogenitors in the notch signaling-inhibited ness, we performed nes-reforming assay  <cit> . ness were enzymatically dissociated into single cells and allowed to re-construct sphere colonies in nsm with or without dapt. as shown in figure 3e, the number of emerging spheres in the dapt-treated cells was reduced to 25% that of the control group in cha <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells in dmso control and dapt-treated cells, respectively; p <  <dig> ) and h <dig>  cell line s. the reformation frequency of hesc-derived sphere colony has not previously been estimated with hesc-derived ness, making it impossible to compare the reformation efficiency, but it seems to be about ten-fold less than the frequency  of mouse neuroprogenitors derived in vivo  <cit> . in addition, results of the bromo-2'-deoxyuridine  incorporation assay showed that dapt treatment reduced the proportion of replicating cells to 39% of the control group for cha <dig> hescs or 60% of the control group for h <dig> hescs . together, these results show that the notch signaling is mainly involved in the maintenance of rosette structures, the biochemical roles of which are probably linked to maintenance and self-renewal of the neuroprogenitor population in ness.

inhibition of notch signaling drives neuroectodermal spheres to differentiate into neuronal cells
we also investigated the effects of notch inhibition by dapt. rt-pcr analyses for the expressions of neuroprogenitor marker genes and notch-related genes showed that dapt treatment of ness resulted in a marked change in the gene expression profile . in general, notch inhibition induces neuroprogenitor cells to differentiate to neuronal cells in vertebrate and invertebrate . we examined whether the hesc-derived ness displayed a similar trend of differentiation. immunostaining of the dapt-treated ness for  <dig> days showed that neurite formation was markedly increased compared with the dmso control, as shown by α-tuj <dig> antibody staining . we counted the number of tuj1-positive cells after dissociation of ness into single cells. the proportion of tuj1-positive cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in dmso control and dapt-treated ness, respectively . as a reference, the proportion of nestin-positive cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in dmso control and dapt group, respectively . western-blot analyses showed that expression levels of neuronal markers such as tuj <dig> and map <dig> were increased in dapt-treated ness, while not the levels of glial markers such as gfap, s <dig>  ng <dig> and cnpase . these results indicate that dapt-mediated notch inhibition enriches neuronal cell population in the ness.

moreover, withdrawal of growth factors  such as fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , leukemia inhibitory factor  and epidermal growth factor   <cit>  from the nsm furthered differentiation of the hesc-derived ness into neuronal cells , agreeing with previous reports  <cit> . in the absence of gfs, dapt treatment resulted in accumulation of neurite bundles about ness , in contrast to the samples treated with both gf and dapt in which neurite bundles were hardly detected. these results coincided with the rt-pcr result in figure 3d where notch inhibition resulted in silencing hes <dig> and hes <dig> genes, which in turn continued to de-repress pro-neuronal genes such as ngn <dig> and mash <dig>  <cit> . meanwhile, the gf-negative dmso control at day  <dig> and  <dig> still possessed rosettes, the sizes of which, however, were tiny compared with those of gf-positive dmso control. this leads to a speculation that small-sized rosettes are supposed to be gradually fused together to large-sized ones and, in this process, gfs play roles in facilitating the presumable fusion event among individual rosettes. together, our results indicate that inhibition of notch signaling disturbs the self-renewal of neuroprogenitors in the hesc-derived ness and leads ultimately to differentiation to neuronal cells. however, we should keep in mind that the γ-secretase that is inactivated by dapt not only cleaves notch receptors but also other proteins . for confirmation that notch inhibition indeed directs neuronal differentiation, evidence needs to be provided supporting that the dapt effects on rosette structure can be rescued with exogenous nicd expression in dapt-treated cultures, or be mimicked by knockdown experiments for nicd or rbp.

nscs have considerable therapeutic values in cell-replacing regenerative treatment of currently incurable neural diseases. in addition, unlimited supply of functional human neurons is only possibly from nscs, and this would allow a fast and effective high throughput screening for neural disease therapies. human escs are undoubtedly the preferred source of nscs. we have developed a simple method for deriving nscs or neuroprogenitors from hescs, with an emphasis on minimizing the degree of variation among individual ebs and sphere colonies through size regulation . the use of sub-culture devices such as tissue chopper  <cit>  or escd  <cit>  allowed us to obtain ebs with regular sizes  that form homogeneous ness. our method of nes derivation has the advantages of a short culture period, thus avoiding additional attachment and selection steps  <cit> . this markedly simplifies the current nes derivation procedures  <cit>  without reducing the efficiency, which is necessary for the practical application of hesc-derived nscs to cell therapeutics and drug screening. our nes derivation protocol is similar to a recently reported protocol  <cit> .

in vertebrate, activation of notch signals inhibits neuronal differentiation and maintains the stem-cell characteristics of nscs or neuroprogenitors derived in vivo  <cit> . we investigated whether notch signaling is active and therefore has a genuine role in the hesc-derived ness, and we obtained several results. first, results of rt-pcr and western-blot analyses showed that most of the known key components of the notch signaling pathway such as receptors , ligands , and regulators  were abundantly expressed in the ness at the protein and mrna levels . second, the expression levels of notch signal members and the resulting target genes  were increased in the ness compared with those in the ebs. this was particularly true for the nicd, dll <dig>  jag <dig> and hes <dig> . third, immunostaining of the ness for the plasma-membrane-bound ligand jag <dig> and dll <dig> demonstrated that both are localized mainly to the cells comprising inner rims of the rosettes, rather than being expressed throughout the ness . fourth, the treatment with notch inhibitor dapt removed rosette structures from both floating and attached ness, and was associated with the reduction of nsc marker expressions and proliferation potential in the ness . finally, dapt treatment induced neurite formation and increased expression of tuj <dig> , indicating that notch inhibition drives the ness to differentiate preferentially into neuronal cells, in agreement with the observation that notch-inhibited neuroprogenitor cells favor differentiation toward neuronal cells in vertebrate and invertebrate . therefore, we concluded that notch signaling actively functions in the ness or, more specifically, in the rosettes, and that notch signaling is responsible for maintenance of the stem-cell features of nscs or neuroprogenitors in the rosettes. therefore, our results indicate that the hesc-derived ness or the neural rosettes are a good in-vitro model for neurogenesis in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
nscs have considerable therapeutic values in cell-replacing-regenerative treatment of currently incurable neural diseases. hescs are one of the best sources of nscs or neuroprogenitor cells owing to their unlimited proliferation. in this study, we derived ness containing neuroprogenitors from hescs, and verified that these hesc-derived ness were typical of neurospheres burying neuroprogenitors and were characteristic of activated notch signaling. dapt-induced inhibition of notch signaling led to loss of the stem-cell characteristics from the ness and drove them to differentiate into neuronal cells. these results are the first to demonstrate the roles of notch signaling in hesc-derived ness with biochemical features similar to those in neurospheres derived from animal brains, or fetal or adult human brains. therefore, the hesc-derived ness or neural rosettes are considered to be a good in vitro model for studying the neurogenesis that occurs in vivo. we believe that our results might aid further study of the mechanisms by which rosettes form and expand in vitro, how neuroprogenitor cells maintain their stem-cell-like characteristics in the cell culture environment, and the stem-cell characteristics that lead to asymmetric division.
