BACKGROUND
the burp domain-containing protein family is defined by its conserved amino acid motif whose name is based on four typical members, bnm <dig>  usp, rd <dig>  and pg1β. burp domain-containing proteins have so far only been found in plants, suggesting that their functions may be plant specific. generally, the burp family proteins consist of several modules: an n-terminal hydrophobic domain, a presumptive transit peptide; a variable internal region containing either a short conserved segment or other segments; an optional segment consisting of repeated units which is unique to each member; and the burp domain at the c-terminus  <cit> .

burp domain-containing proteins were classified into four subfamilies, bnm2-like, usp-like, rd22-like, and pg1β-like  <cit> . all members of each subfamily contain burp domain at the c-terminal region. within the domain there are several conserved amino acid residues, including four cystein-histidine repeats and one tryptophan residue. the spacing between the four ch residues is highly conserved, being x5-ch-x10-ch-x23-27-ch-x23-26-ch-x8-w, where x is any amino acid. the difference between the burp domain-containing proteins mostly occurred in the region immediately downstream of the hydrophobic signal peptide. this region contains a short conserved segment and an optional segment of repeated units. unlike other burp domain-containing proteins, the bnm2-like subfamily proteins are directly linked to the c-terminal region by a short conserved segment following the signal peptide  <cit> . both the usp-like subfamily and rd22-like subfamily proteins can be distinguished from other subfamily proteins by a region containing ~ <dig> amino acid residues followed by a variable region. however, for the rd22-like subfamily proteins, the variable region consists of repeat sequences while usp-like subfamily has no such a region  <cit> . the pg1β-like family proteins differ from other subfamily members by the presence of multiple copies of a  <dig> amino-acid repeat sequence  <cit> .

many members of the burp protein family have been found in various plant species but the functions of these proteins are unknown or only tentatively explored. transcription of bnm <dig> from oilseed rape  is induced at the start of microspore embryogenesis but the corresponding protein remains confined to seeds where it is localized in the protein storage vacuoles  <cit> . vfusp, an abundant non-storage seed protein with unknown function from the field bean , is expressed during the early stages of zygotic embryogenesis  <cit> , and at very early stages of in vitro embryogenesis  <cit> . asg <dig> is a specifically expressed gene during the early embryo sac development in apomictic gynoecia, but does not express in sexual gynoecia of panicum  <cit> . pg1β, the non-catalytic β-subunit of the polygalacturonase isozyme  from ripening tomato  plays a significant role in regulating pectin metabolism by limiting the extent of pectin solubilization and depolymerization  <cit> . scb <dig> is a seed coat specific protein  <cit>  identified in soybean. osraftin <dig>  an anther-specific protein in rice , transports sporopollenin from tapetum to developing microspores via ubisch bodies  <cit> . atuspl <dig> occurs in cellular compartments such as golgi cisternae, dense vesicles, prevaculoar vesicles and the protein storage vacuoles in the parenchyma cell of cotyledons, and thus may play a role in seed development  <cit> . so it seems that many burp family members play a role in maintaining the normal metabolism or development in plants.

besides their significant roles in plant development and metabolism, many burp domain-containing proteins have been reported to be stress-induced. rd <dig>  a drought induced protein of arabidopsis  <cit> , has often been used as a reference for drought stress treatment in different plants. the mechanism for abscisic acid  regulation of plants stress has been well studied in arabidopsis. aba activates the gene expression of rd22bp <dig> and atmyb <dig>  which in return induces the expression of the rd <dig> gene as transcription factors  <cit> . both adr <dig>  the auxin down-regulated protein  <cit> , and sali3- <dig>  an aluminium-induced protein  <cit> , were found in soybean. transcription of bnbdc <dig>  from oilseed rape, was up-regulated by manitol, nacl and aba, and down-regulated by uv irradiation and salicylic acid  <cit> . among the  <dig> burp genes from oryza sativa,  <dig> were induced by at least one of the stresses including drought, salt, cold, and aba treatment  <cit> . all the reports about burp family genes indicate that this group of genes may have two major functions in plants. one is the regulation of reproductive development in plants, such as bnm <dig>  vfusp and asg <dig>  while the other is responsive to stress, for example rd <dig> and adr <dig> 

soybean is one of the most economically and nutritionally important crops. it provides not only vegetable protein and edible oil but also essential amino acids for humans and animals. however, soybean production is threatened by drought and other environmental stresses. burp domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in embryogenesis or stress responses. over the years, some of the soybean burp proteins including adr <dig>  sali3- <dig> and scb <dig> have been identified and studied. as the genome sequence of the soybean is complete, it is possible to analyze the entire family of soybean burp proteins. in the current study,  <dig> putative genes of the burp family were identified. to discover the functions of all the members, we investigated the transcript level of all genes in eight different tissues and organs as well as under  <dig> different stress treatments. the results presented in this study showed that the expression of most of the soybean burp genes is non-tissue-specific but stress-responsive.

RESULTS
identification and distribution of soybean burp family members
through soybean genome blast and online software identification, a total of  <dig> putative burp genes were identified. these putative genes were designated gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> . previously reported burp domain-containing protein genes in soybean, scb <dig>  adr <dig>  burp <dig>  and sali3- <dig> correspond to gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , respectively. the  <dig> soybean burp genes were located on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . we noticed that burp genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> clustered together with each other. examination of the location of each burp gene http://soybase.org/gbrowse/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gmax <dig> / revealed that all gmburp genes except for gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , were located in duplicate regions . gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  were found as single copy in their duplicated areas. the results of intron-exon structure identification  showed that most of burp domain-containing protein genes have very few introns,  <dig> out of  <dig> have only one intron;  <dig> have two introns; and  <dig> have no introns. the other two genes have  <dig> introns. burp genes located close to each other on the same chromosome tend to have similar structures. specifically, both gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  have one intron flanked by two exons; gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  have one intron; gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  have  <dig> introns. however, gm <dig>  has one intron and the nearby gm <dig>  has two introns.

sequence analysis of burp proteins
the burp domain for each predicted protein was identified by searching against the smart database. one of  <dig> burp domain-containing proteins, gm <dig>  had only an incomplete burp domain at the c-terminal. the characteristics of the soybean burp proteins including the signal peptide, pi, molecular weight, and some additional gene features are presented in table  <dig> 

based on the protein sequences and the produced phylogenetic tree,  <dig> burp proteins from different species  were classified into  <dig> subfamilies, bnm2-like, usp-like, rd22-like, pg1β-like, and burpv . the first four subfamilies had been defined before, but burpv is new. interestingly, all the burpv members were from soybean. from the alignment of burp domain sequences, several highly conserved residues were identified: two glycine residues, two f residues, two e residues, and four ch motifs . the conserved sequence of the burp domain was described as x5-ch-x10-ch-x23-27-ch-x23-26-ch-x8-w, where x means any amino acid residue. however, not all sequences corresponded to this consensus. gm <dig>  with incomplete burp domain lacked all the conserved residues but had all four ch motifs. in gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  the last conserved residue w was replaced by f; and gm <dig>  lacked the last ch motif.

organ and tissue specific expression of gmburp genes
several genes of the burp family have been noted for their differential expression patterns in various plant tissues and organs. as a way to reveal the expression pattern of each gmburp gene, the transcript levels were determined in  <dig> different tissues and organs  of soybean cultivar zhonghuang <dig> using qrt-pcr analysis . the gene specific primers are listed in table  <dig>  the result showed that gmburp genes vary widely in their specificities and in expression levels. according to their expression specificity gmburp genes were divided into two groups. the first group  were expressed in all  <dig> tissues and organs but in different levels. judging from their expression patterns, these genes may play roles in some basic metabolic pathways. gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  were strongly expressed in roots. gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were strongly expressed in stems. gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were most strongly expressed in leaves. gm <dig>  gm <dig> and gm <dig>  were strongly expressed in flowers, indicating that they may play a role in soybean sexual reproduction. gm <dig>  gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were highly expressed in epicotyls. gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  had high expression levels in hypocotyls. in seeds only two genes, gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were highly expressed, indicating that they could have similar functions as gm <dig> 

the second group of genes  were not expressed in at least one of the eight selected tissues and organs. all the genes of this group, except for gm <dig>  were not expressed in leaves. gm <dig>  was not expressed in any of the eight tissues and organs. it may, however, be specifically expressed in certain tissues or development periods not studied here. gm <dig> , one of the well studied gmburp genes from soybean, was highly expressed in seeds, very low expression in stems and cotyledons, and no expression in the other  <dig> tissues. gm <dig>  was highly expressed in hypocotyls, but not in leaves and roots, which suggested that it mainly functions at the early stages of soybean development. gm <dig>  had relatively high expression in epicotyls and flowers. gm <dig> was highly expressed in epicotyls but not in seeds. as gm <dig>  it may mainly function at the early stages of plant development. gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were expressed only in roots and stems. since each member of this group lacked expression in one or more analysed tissues or organs, this group of genes may have more specific functions in soybean than the group  <dig> burp genes.

all the gmburp genes, except for gm <dig>  of the pg1β-like subfamily, were highly expressed in epicotyls. only two burpv subfamily members  were highly expressed in seeds. three genes, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , of the five gmburp genes belonging to the usp-like subfamily were highly expressed in hypocotyls. two bnm2-like subfamily genes gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  had high expression levels in hypocotyls, and gm <dig>  also had a high expression level in stems. meanwhile, the expression levels of the rd22-like genes varied widely but all of them were expressed in all eight selected tissues and organs. more specifically, gm <dig>  was mainly expressed in stems, leaves and epicotyls; gm <dig>  was relatively high expressed in flowers and hypocotyls; gm <dig>  was mainly expressed in leaves, flowers, and hypocotyls; while gm <dig>  was highly expressed in epicotyls. the expression pattern indicates that members belonging to this subfamily may play significant roles in soybean, but it was postulated that they mainly function in different tissues or organs.

promoter cis-element identification and expression under stress treatments
several genes of the burp family have been reported to be stress related. examples are rd <dig> from arabidopsis which responds to drought, and sali3- <dig>  which is induced by aluminium.

the online database place was used to identify cis-elements for each gmburp gene.  <dig> bp upstream of the full-length cdnas were searched against the database and two putative stress-responsive cis-elements abre  and dre   <cit>  were found for most of the gmburp genes . abre sequences were found in the promoter region of  <dig> of the  <dig> gmburp genes except gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  dre sequences were found in the promoter regions of  <dig> gmburp genes . we noticed that abre elements were identified in the promoter regions of all members from bnm2-like, usp-like, and rd22-like subfamily but not burpv subfamily. dre sequences were identified in some members of all four subfamilies except burpv. the results indicate that most of the gmburp genes may be stress-relative.

to support the predictions made by place analysis, dehydration and salt-inducible gmburp genes were screened. water potential determination results showed that water potential of all samples was lowered under aba, nacl, or peg treatments, indicating that plants were effectively stressed . qrt-pcr was employed to analyze the gene expression on transcriptional level under three different treatments . the result showed that  <dig> gmburp genes responded to at least one of the stress treatments. for aba treatment two genes, gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , and three genes, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , were up- and down-regulated, respectively, while  <dig> genes  were initially up-regulated and later down-regulated during the later stages of the treatment. after peg treatment  <dig> genes  were up-regulated, and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated, while  <dig> genes  were first up and then down-regulated. the expression patterns under nacl were different:  <dig> genes, gm <dig>  gm <dig> and gm <dig> , were up-regulated;  <dig> genes, gm <dig>  and gm <dig> , were down regulated;  <dig> genes  were first up and then down-regulated;  <dig> genes, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , were first down-regulated and then up-regulated.

many gmburp genes were regulated by more than one of the treatments. among the  <dig> stress responsive gmburp genes,  <dig> of them responded to all the three treatments; two of them  respond to two different stresses; gm <dig> and gm <dig>  only responded to nacl treatment. more interestingly, two genes, gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  which were not expressed in leaves, were also stress responsive: gm <dig>  responded to all the three treatments while gm <dig> responded to nacl treatment only. we also noticed that all the members of bnm2-like , rd22-like and burpv were responsive to at least one treatment. more significantly, rd22-like subfamily genes responded to all three treatments. some members of other subfamilies also responded to stress treatment: the pg1β-like subfamily had three genes  which were stress responsive, while the usp-like subfamily had four genes, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  responded to at least one of the three treatments.

the results of qrt-pcr were not always consistent with these of the promoter region analysis. there were no abre or dre elements detected in any of the promoter regions of burpv family members, but the real-time pcr results showed that all the members of this subfamily were stress responsive. this strongly indicated that some unidentified stress responsive cis-elements may play an important role in regulating the soybean stress response.

discussion
structure characteristics of burp proteins
burp domain-containing proteins contain three or four distinct modules:  an n-terminal hydrophobic domain which is a presumptive signal peptide;  a short conserved segment;  an optional repetitive region which is unique to each member; and  the c-terminal burp domain  <cit> . they were classified into four subfamilies by granger  <cit> , and the structure of the conserved burp domain was described as chx10chx25-27chx25-26ch  <cit> . the most obvious characteristics of the burp domain are 2c residues and  <dig> ch motifs. more recent report showed that the distance between the last three ch motifs are not always 25- <dig> and 25- <dig>  respectively, and the domain was newly described as x5-ch-x10-ch-x23-37-ch-x23-26-ch-x8-w  <cit> . however, the conserved residue f is replaced by w in three burp domain-containing proteins, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig> . it was also noticed that all the three proteins were from rd22-like subfamily.

a lot of work has been done to reveal the structure of the burp domain but still little is known about the function of each module. it is through the burp domain, that scb <dig>  is localized on the cell wall  <cit> . the burp domain of sali3- <dig>  was shown to be a key component for its tolerance to salt. deletion of the signal peptide of sali3- <dig> reduced salt tolerance of transgenic yeast  <cit> . so, it seems that these two parts are important for the function of burp proteins. however, the mature pg1β contains only the repeated region after the cleavage site of its transit peptide, and the burp domain. these two parts form a pg <dig> complex with catalytic pg <dig> polypeptide  <cit> . despite the conservation of the burp domains and their sequence similarities, the function of each burp protein and the roles of each module seem to be greatly varied among plants.

evolution of burp genes and divergence of their functions
in total  <dig> burp domain-containing proteins from various plants were classified into  <dig> subfamilies. members of rd22-like, bnm2-like, usp-like, and burpv subfamilies were all from dicotyledons, while in pg1β subfamily members can come from both dicotyledon and monocotyledon plants.

the classification of the burp protein genes may not be final, and it remains unknown how these subgroups evolved. by comparing the surrounding genomic sequences, hattori  <cit>  proposed that the exons coding the signal peptide and c-terminal burp region may have been "shuffled" into the various modular protein structures. hattori also suggested that in view of the highly repetitive nature of the burp proteins, the amplification of short sequences has also been important during the evolution of the family. the pg1β subfamily burp proteins from dicotyledons were clustered more closely than the two  from monocotyledons which suggested that burp genes existed before the divergence of the monocotyledon and dicotyledon lineages. four gmburps  are more closely clustered with each other than with at <dig> from arabidopsis and two gmburp proteins, gm <dig>  and gm <dig> , are more closely clustered than four proteins  from tomato, indicating that duplications of some burp genes in glycine max happened earlier than the divergence of soybean and arabidopsis or tomato. it is the same in bnm2-like, and usp-like subfamilies, suggesting that the divergence of soybean from faba bean , and oilseed rape happened after the duplication of gmburp genes.

the location of burp genes in soybean may also give some insight into the evolution of the gene family.  <dig> out of  <dig> burp genes were found located in duplicated regions .  <dig> out of the  <dig> burp genes  located in duplicate regions appear to originate from segmental duplications. gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  seem to originate from tandem duplications. among the  <dig> burp genes, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were found as single copies, this is not surprising because mass gene losses and chromosome rearrangements following large-scale genome duplication have occurred in soybean  <cit> , leading to losses of about 25% of duplicated genes  <cit> . the four genes, gm <dig>  gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig> , which are located outside of the duplicated region, might have been produced by retrotransposition. the structure similarity and variation between genes located on the same chromosome and phylogenetic analysis might help to explain the order of duplication evens of the sister genes on the same chromosome. for example, gm <dig> , gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  located in different duplicate regions of the same chromosome, all have two introns flanked by three exons. however, phylogenetic analysis showed that gm <dig>  was more similar to gm <dig> , and gm <dig>  was close to gm <dig>  while gm <dig>  which is located relatively close to gm <dig>  had no duplicate genes on chromosome  <dig>  it is possible that the duplication of the same ancestral gene on chromosome  <dig> created gm <dig>  and ancestor for gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  then they evolve independently. the intron and exon sequences for ancestor gene elongated for various reasons before it split into gm <dig>  and gm <dig> . through fragmental duplication the two chromosome fragments, one contains gm <dig>  and the other contains gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were independently copied to different part of chromosome  <dig>  during the later evolution, the counterpart of gm <dig>  was lost and structures for the counterparts of gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  changed by deletion or insertion of other fragments or partial sequence repeats variations.

genome blast did not identify any burp genes in chlamydomonas reinhardtii http://genome.jgi-psf.org/, while  <dig> burp proteins from physcomitrella patens subsp.patens were recorded in ncbi protein database. chlamydomonas reinhardtii lives in lakes or other freshwaters, while the moss physcomitrella patens grows on land, the differences in the burp distribution indicate that burp family genes appeared when plants start to move from water to land where the environment became more variable. the origin of burp genes indicates this gene family may play a role in plant adaptation to adverse environments. according to the phylogenetic analysis, burp genes from different species were classified into  <dig> subfamilies, this classification suggests that their functions diversified during evolution. bnm <dig>  expressed during the start of microspore embryogenesis and the corresponding protein is confined to seeds  <cit> , vfusp, expressed during the early stages of zygotic embryogenesis  <cit>  indicating that proteins in bnm <dig> and usp subfamilies may have similar functions. pg1β, the non-catalyticβ-subunit of the polygalacturonase isozyme , and scb <dig> from soybean seed coat suggest possibly similar functions for the other members in pg1β and burpv subfamilies. rd <dig>  from arabidopsis, has been reported to be stress related. it is interesting that during embryogenesis, fruit ripening and seed development the cells need to lose water and store certain materials to fulfil the physical functions. during these processes an in-cell stress environment may be created. it seems possible that the diversified burp members retain their original of stress response functions. for example, proteins belonging to rd <dig> subfamily mainly respond to stresses during the vegetative plant development, while members from usp or bnm <dig> subfamilies respond to stresses during plant reproduction.

organ or tissue specific expression of gmburp genes and their expression under different stress treatments
in the current work, gmburp gene expression pattern in different tissues and organs and under various stress conditions were analyzed by qrt-pcr. the result showed that some genes with high sequence similarity also have similar expression pattern in different tissues and organs or under different stress conditions. for instance, two genes gm <dig> and gm <dig>  which are similar to each other, were expressed in all eight different tissues and organs and both had very low expression in leaves and seeds, while highly expressed in epicotyls and, under three different stress treatments they all had an up-regulated period. two closely clustered genes, gm <dig> , and gm <dig> , of the bnm2-like subfamily, were highly expressed in stems and hypocotyls, and responded to all stress treatments. all the gmburp genes from rd22-like subfamily showed no tissue specificity, and were responsive to all stress treatments. however, not all genes with similar sequences showed the same expression pattern. e.g. gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  are closely clustered and highly similar members of the pg1β-like subfamily. gm <dig>  was expressed in all eight tissues and organs and did not respond to any of the three stress treatments, while gm <dig>  was not expressed in leaves, and respond to all stress treatments. gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  from the same subfamily with high sequence similarity showed different expression patterns, too: gm <dig>  had no expression in leaves, but it responded to aba or drought treatments. although gm <dig>  did not expressed in leaves either, it was not responsive to any of the three treatments. two genes, gm <dig>  and gm <dig> , from the bnm2-subfamily showed the same patterns as gm <dig>  and gm <dig> . previously described examples also existed in the usp-like family. sequence similarity indicates that these genes might be the result of relatively recent gene duplication events. the difference of tissue or organ specificity and stress response maybe result from different upstream or downstream regulatory elements or factors.

through phylogenetic analysis we defined a new subfamily, burpv, containing two members which are all from soybean. promoter analysis revealed no abre or dre elements was found in the upstream  <dig> bp region of the full length cdna. interestingly, all the burpvgenes responded to at least one stress treatment, suggesting the existence of some unknown stress related cis-element. one member of this new defined subfamily, scb <dig> , a seed coat specific protein has been reported to have very strict expression pattern  <cit> , but we found that in addition to the strong expression in seeds, it was slightly expressed in cotyledons and stems. interestingly, despite the lack of expression in leaves, scb <dig> was up-regulated by nacl stress. another gmburp gene, gm <dig> , from the new subfamily burp may also play a role during seed development because it had a similar expression pattern to scb <dig> which made it a candidate gene for study of the influence of stress treatments on seed development.

soybean is very important for the society because it is a major source of oil and protein-rich food. however, the production of soybean is threatened by drought and restricted by poor soil quality. rd <dig>  an arabidopsis drought responsive gene has been reported for its stress response  <cit> . all the gmburp genes belonging to rd22-like subfamily and most of gmburp genes from other subfamilies are stress responsive. it's worth mentioning that the gmburp genes gm <dig> , gm <dig>  and gm <dig> , which had no detectable transcription detected in unstressed leaves, were induced by stress treatments.

CONCLUSIONS
the burp domain-containing proteins are a large family of evolutionarily conserved proteins only found in plants. members of the family had been reported to be involved in the reproductive development and stress resistance of plants. in this study of the complete soybean genome, we identified  <dig> burp proteins. we also propose their classification based on the sequence alignment and previous reports which give insight into the evolutionary relationships of the genes from multiple plant species. in addition, qrt-pcr analysis revealed the expression patterns of these genes in different tissues and under different stress treatments. most burp genes showed no tissue specificity and respond to stress treatments. clearly, there is a need to functionally validate the roles of those genes induced under different stress conditions. another important finding of the work is that all the members in soybean that belong to rd <dig> subfamily showed strong response to all three stress treatments. this may indicate that this subfamily specifically acted as a defence against stress in soybeans, and it is likely to play similar roles in other plant species. the results described here will be helpful for the further study of the functions of burp domain-containing proteins, and for the screening candidate drought resistance genes in soybean and in other plants.
