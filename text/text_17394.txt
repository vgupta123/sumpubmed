BACKGROUND
the overall breadth of prostate cancer and problems associated with it render it necessary to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics for the disease. prostate cancer is the most-diagnosed non-skin cancer in the united states, with an estimated  <dig>  new diagnoses in  <dig> alone  <cit> . it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among males in the u.s., with an estimated  <dig>  mortalities in  <dig>  <cit> . the scope of this disease portends the necessity in developing improved clinical tools for its treatment.

it is necessary to develop specifically targeted therapeutics and diagnostics to further aid in treatment of prostate cancer. current practices for prostate cancer are partially effective; however they are not specific for the disease, causing many unwanted side effects and over-diagnoses. therapeutic side effects can be serious and leave the possibility for recurrence in a more aggressive, androgen-independent form  <cit> . for many non-localized cancers, chemotherapies are used which can be effective, however specific delivery would be more effective and cause fewer side effects  <cit> . in addition to non-specific therapeutics, prostate cancer diagnosis using prostate specific antigen  blood levels is no longer recommended for use by the united states preventive services task force   <cit> . this is because serum psa levels are raised not only due to cancerous prostates, but due to benign prostatic conditions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia , benign prostate hyperplasia , and prostatitis  <cit> . studies have shown the specificity of the psa test in prostate cancer diagnosis to be just 24%, meaning there is a 76% over-diagnosis rate, and that it will prevent just one prostate cancer-related death in greater than  <dig> men  <cit> . many other biomarkers identified that may have some diagnostic potential, however are not specific for prostate cancer  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to develop molecular targeting mechanisms for clinical use against prostate cancer.

an increasingly popular method to develop disease-specific targeting molecules is through antibody fragment library screening. previous library screening methodologies have been adapted for use in identifying molecules that bind to whole-cell targets  <cit> . additionally, screening methods exist for utilizing antibody fragment libraries displayed on bacteriophage, bacteria, and yeast  <cit> . antibody fragments that bind to cell surfaces have largely been selected from phage-displayed libraries, with examples including those that bind to ovarian, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells  <cit> . it is therefore possible to identify antibody fragments which bind to the surface of prostate cancer cells.

the work described here enriches an antibody fragment library for molecules which bind to androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. additionally, multiple stringent negative enrichments using targets to which the antibody fragment should not bind were selected against. this work has identified an antibody fragment which binds to androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, and not to various benign prostate cells. it utilized a human non-immune single-chain fragment variable  library displayed on the surface of sacchoromyces cerevisiae. it is hoped that the obtained scfv will be useful for both specific treatment and diagnosis of prostate cancer and serves as proof-of-principle for future screening of disease-specific antibody fragments.

RESULTS
antibody fragment screening
in order to obtain androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell-specific antibody fragments, seven rounds of screening and enrichment were completed with a yeast-displayed scfv library  <cit>  . sequencing of a random, representative sample of the scfv-encoding plasmid in the initial naïve library, as well as after round  <dig> and round  <dig> of panning, was performed. out of the 30– <dig> sequences identified, there were no duplicate sequences in any library or between the libraries. this suggests that no particular sequence was selected for in these rounds.

after three rounds, facs-based screening was performed. in round  <dig> , there were two separate populations of yeast binding to target cells which were kept separate through the remaining rounds of screening and termed ‘hi’ and ‘lo’ . after round  <dig>  the lo population was comprised of 29% hir <dig>  . interestingly, hir <dig>  and hir <dig>  were not identified in the lo population. hir <dig>  comprised 100% of the population in rounds  <dig> and  <dig>  this suggests that hir <dig>  out-competed all other molecules in the lo population. it should be noted that hir <dig>  and hir <dig>  are both truncated sequences containing only the heavy chain, while hir <dig>  is a full-length scfv .

italicized amino acids represent the heavy chain. bold amino acids represent the light chain. hir <dig>  and hir <dig>  do not contain a light chain. non-italicized or bolded amino acids represent scfv structural elements.

in the round  <dig> hi population, however, hir <dig>  comprised 52% of the population, while hir <dig>  was 26%. interestingly, hir <dig>  did not appear in the round  <dig> hi population. in the round  <dig> population, 77% of the library was hir <dig>  while 3% was hir <dig> . hir <dig>  now comprised 20% of the library. in round  <dig>  hir <dig>  was no longer detected, while hir <dig>  was now just 16% of the library. hir <dig>  comprised 84% of the library, suggesting it strongly outcompeted hir <dig> . it is also of note that hir <dig>  and hir <dig>  did not appear in any previous library sequencing, however hir <dig>  did appear once in the round  <dig> library. this enrichment and convergence upon hir <dig>  validates the sequence enrichment capabilities of this dual-method screening strategy.

affinity binding assays of scfvs
once hir <dig>  and hir <dig>  was identified for further characterization, each was cloned into a secretion vector, expressed, purified, and verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . these were used in fluorescent saturation binding assays with lncap cells as described in the methods, plotted, and fit with nonlinear regression analysis . hir <dig>  exhibited an equilibrium dissociation constant  of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  nm. a kd of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  nm was obtained for hir <dig> .binding of each scfv for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells is further evidenced by fluorescent micrographic analysis. binding of each scfv is clear when pre-incubated with a secondary fluorescent antibody and then with target cells and imaged for fluorescent staining . fluorescence is much brighter than target cells incubated with fluorescent secondary-only control  and comparable to the positive control . interestingly, both antibodies have a horseshoe-like staining pattern for each cell. therefore, fluorescence may be visualized in the cytosol surrounding the nucleus.

specificity binding assays of scfvs
purified scfvs were each assayed for their ability to bind to cell lines other than lncap. these included the negative targets in the screening strategy, hgpin, bph- <dig>  and bhpre <dig> . they also included androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines du- <dig> and pc- <dig> as well as normal prostate epithelium cell lines rwpe- <dig> and nhpre <dig> .from these experiments, it is clear that hir <dig>  binds to all three negative cell lines as well as the other four lines assayed . binding to many of these lines was as good or better than binding to lncap cells. this is a likely explanation as to why hir <dig>  was eliminated from both populations, in spite of its low dissociation constant. hir <dig> , however, showed excellent selectivity for lncap cells . binding to hgpin, bph- <dig>  and bhpre <dig> cells all were much less than to the target cancer cells. subtraction of background secondary antibody mfi from scfv binding resulted in negative numbers due to binding of the secondary antibody to the scfv and not the cell lines. additionally, binding to the four cell lines not used in screening and enrichment was significantly less relative to binding to target cells. in sum, this suggests that hir <dig>  is highly specific to androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells and therefore will be useful in both the therapeutic targeting and disease detection of prostate cancer.

discussion
the library screening and enrichment strategy used in this work focused on multiple, stringent negative enrichment targets to identify a scfv specific for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. three rounds of panning were performed to remove scfvs with very low target affinity or that bound to molecules highly expressed on other cell surfaces  <cit> . there was a large amount of diversity present in the library however, so a more stringent separation method, facs, was employed  <cit> . initial use of facs would have been unsuccessful as prior work has shown the efficiency of facs is poor at low concentrations of the binding population  <cit> . thus, removal of non-binding molecules increased the concentration of binding scfv in the population, allowing successful facs isolation due to its single-cell and quantitative nature, as has previously been described  <cit> . additionally, the initial library size was much too great to efficiently analyze single cells in a reasonable time span. thus, panning followed by facs was utilized, and the strong enrichment of the identified random sample of the library validates this strategy.

from the obvious enrichment through seven rounds of screening , hir <dig>  was chosen as the most likely prostate cancer cell-specific antibody fragment and underwent further characterization. however, as a representative of scfvs present in earlier rounds of screening and to determine why it was outcompeted, hir <dig>  was also chosen for further characterization. it is also important to note that hir <dig>  is a full-length scfv, comprising both a heavy and light chain, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  kda for the scfv itself. hir <dig>  and hir <dig> , however, only contain a heavy chain, as they are truncated just before the chain linker. they have a predicted molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively, and have 81% sequence identity and 86% sequence similarity. this may be relevant in vivo, as it has been shown that smaller scfvs have greater tumor penetration ability than larger antibodies  <cit> . it is possible that truncated scfvs will suffer from decreased stability. future work will assay stability in envisioned applications and, if necessary, perform mutagenesis to select stable variants  <cit>  or insert it into the scaffold of a stable full antibody  <cit> .

the dissociation constants for each of these scfvs are in the low-nanomolar range, which is similar to previous reports of scfvs isolated from similar screening strategies  <cit> . more importantly, it is in a similar range to other antibody fragments that have strong pharmacokinetic properties  <cit> . it is possible that further mutagenesis and screening may select for scfvs with higher affinity for the cell surface target  <cit> .

it may be possible that fluorescent staining images represent cellular uptake of the scfv-secondary antibody complex due to the cytoplasmic pattern. this has previously shown to be possible and even likely with scfvs alone or in complex with other molecules  <cit> . if these scfvs are taken up by androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, this may have an important role in the clinical application of these scfvs. the potential ability to use these scfvs as therapeutic targeting agents in the form of antibody-drug conjugates  is enhanced by scfv internalization  <cit> . potential uptake of the scfv by androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells will be explored in future studies.

biologically, the selectivity of hir <dig>  for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells is important. hir <dig>  clearly binds to other cell lines tested, and this is likely the cause of its depletion from the library as the stringency of facs enrichment increased. this depletion seems to validate the powerful selectivity of the facs screening strategy. there is an absence of binding to all benign cell lines studied, whether they represent normal prostatic cells, bph, or pin. this suggests that the cell surface molecule hir <dig>  is binding to is not displayed on the surface of benign prostatic cells. this is supported by previous studies that have identified many genes differentially expressed between the benign conditions represented here and prostate cancer cells  <cit> . additionally, there is no binding to the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines du- <dig> or pc- <dig>  this suggests that the cell surface antigen is displayed in the earlier, androgen-dependent stage of prostate cancer. this is possible considering previous studies have found a wide array of genes that are differentially expressed from androgen dependent to independent disease progression, many of which are downregulated  <cit> . in fact, downregulation of expression levels from lncap to both du- <dig> and pc- <dig> cells has been found before  <cit>  future work will determine binding to other androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells utilizing antigen capture techniques coupled with mass spectrometry. determining binding will be aided by identifying the exact cell surface molecule to which hir <dig>  is binding, as has been done before with similar cell surface antigen-binding molecules  <cit> . this type of work has even identified novel cell surface molecules previously unknown to be involved in disease progression  <cit> . it is therefore possible that this work not only created a novel targeting agent, but also identified a novel target.

the high affinity and specificity of hir <dig>  for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells suggest it has potential in future therapeutic and diagnostic applications in prostate cancer. though not determined here, future work will determine its binding to tissue representing androgen-dependent prostate cancer and other prostatic diseases which will determine the translational potential of the molecule. it is likely, however, that hir <dig>  will bind to androgen-dependent prostate cancer tissue from patients based on binding specificity and affinity similar to previously-identified molecules  <cit> . the selective scfv will likely be useful for drug delivery as has been shown before  <cit> . it has previously been noted that scfvs have much less immunogenicity than full antibodies in part due to their size and lack of an fc component  <cit> . additionally, it will likely have use in specific diagnosis of prostate cancer whether in or ex vivo <cit> . finally, identification of the cell surface markers to which these scfvs bind may possibly identify novel proteins, new functions, or expression patterns that aid in treatment and diagnosis of prostate cancer and will be done in future work. this cell surface molecule and its expression pattern in androgen-dependent prostate cancers will determine the translation of the identified scfv beyond the cells used here. while it is likely to be useful in a defined set of prostate cancers, the antibody fragment screening strategy described here also serves as a proof-of-principle for selection of other disease-specific antibody fragments.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has selected a scfv antibody fragment, hir <dig> , with high affinity for androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. furthermore, the selected molecule has a high selectivity for the target cells and not for benign prostatic cells or for androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. these characteristics will allow the selected scfv to be useful for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in the clinical treatment of prostate cancer with further pre-clinical development. with targeted therapeutics and more specific diagnostics, it is possible that increased efficacy and reduced side effects of treatments as well as earlier disease detection will be realized by the scfv obtained here.
