BACKGROUND
the transforming growth factor β  superfamily is involved in many developmental decisions from primitive animals such as cnidaria and sponges to higher animals  <cit> . the core of the signaling pathway has been elucidated in the last few years and reveals a rather simple signaling cascade. these ligands transmit the tgfβ signal by binding transmembrane receptor serine-threonine kinases . once ligand is bound, the type ii rsk phosphorylates the type i rsk in a cytoplasmic region rich in glycine and serine residues . phosphorylation activates the type i rsk and enables it to phosphorylate downstream mediators referred to as the smads. once the receptor-regulated smads  are phosphorylated, they are able to physically interact with another subset of smads identified as the common smads  and translocate to the nucleus where they affect target gene transcription  <cit> .

of the five tgfβ-like ligands in c. elegans, dbl- <dig>  and daf- <dig>  are the best characterized. dbl- <dig> transmits the sma/mab  pathway signal while daf- <dig> regulates formation of dauer, an alternative life stage entered in response to low food or high population density  <cit> . these two pathways share a common type ii rsk, daf- <dig>  daf- <dig> animals are small, exhibit fused male tail sensory rays and constitutively form dauer larvae  <cit> . mutants of all other known components of the dauer pathway are either dauer constitutive  like daf- <dig> or dauer defective   <cit> . based on the sma/mab phenotypes of daf- <dig> mutants, sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and sma- <dig> were identified and cloned. sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and sma- <dig> encode smads while sma- <dig> encodes a type i rsk  <cit> . the sma/mab signal is transmitted upon binding of the ligand, dbl- <dig>  to the type ii and type i rsks, daf- <dig> and sma- <dig> respectively. once stimulated, sma- <dig> activates the smads, sma- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  causing them to affect target gene transcription.

although the core tgfβ pathway is known, additional components that may further refine signaling remain to be identified. to address this issue, we previously conducted a genetic screen for sma animals and isolated several new mutants, including kin- <dig>   <cit> . we find that kin- <dig> is able to suppress the long mutant phenotype generated by animals over-expressing the ligand dbl- <dig>  additionally, we observe that lon- <dig>  a sma/mab pathway target gene whose product shows homology to proteins of the cysteine-rich secretory protein  family, is up-regulated in kin- <dig> mutant animals in a similar manner to that seen in a sma- <dig> null mutant background  <cit> . kin- <dig> mutant animals are also developmentally delayed and this defect is partially suppressed by loss of lon- <dig> function. these data suggest that kin- <dig> genetically interacts with sma/mab pathway signaling downstream of dbl- <dig> but upstream of lon- <dig> 

several of the sma/mab pathway components have been shown to function in the hypodermis to regulate body size morphogenesis. sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and lon- <dig>  when specifically expressed in the hypodermis, have been shown to rescue the body size defects associated with each of these loss-of-function mutations  <cit> . the sma/mab ligand dbl- <dig> is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues  <cit> . it is likely that dbl- <dig> is secreted from these tissues and targets the hypodermis in order to regulate body size formation. we find that tissue-specific expression of kin- <dig> in the hypodermis rescues the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig> animals. in addition, we find that kin- <dig>  when expressed in the same tissues as dbl- <dig>  also rescues the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig> animals. therefore, kin- <dig> can function in both hypodermal and neuronal tissues with known sma/mab pathway components to regulate body size morphogenesis.

in order to understand how kin- <dig> functions in sma/mab pathway signaling, we undertook the molecular characterization of kin- <dig>  it is encoded by f58h <dig> , which has an n-terminal kinase domain and a novel c-terminal region. its kinase domain makes it a distant member of the emk kinase family, which modulates microtubule organization. kin- <dig> has a role in olfaction  <cit> , suggesting that the ability to sense environmental signals influences body size regulation.

RESULTS
kin- <dig> encodes a serine threonine kinase
mutations in members of the sma/mab tgfβ-like signaling pathway result in animals that are phenotypically smaller than wild-type. these sma/mab mutants are approximately 70% the size of their wild-type counterparts  <cit> . based on this small body size phenotype, we set out to isolate additional loci which when mutated resulted in small animals. from an f <dig> ems screen of n <dig> wild-type animals, we identified kin- <dig>  <cit> . kin- <dig> animals are small, like known sma/mab pathway components . however, unlike the known pathway components, kin- <dig> does not possess male tail ray fusions or crumpled spicules, suggesting that kin- <dig> is involved in regulation of body size morphogenesis but not male tail development.

we searched for molecular lesions in kin- <dig>  genomic dna spanning the entire coding region of kin- <dig> was isolated from kin- <dig> animals, sequenced and compared to sequence obtained from est y293c <dig>  sequence analysis reveals kin- <dig> to consist of  <dig> exons that encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids in length . a mutation found in the eighth exon of kin- <dig> changes a single nucleotide from cytosine to thymine. this change results in a premature termination codon and a truncated protein of  <dig> amino acids. while this work was in progress, kin- <dig> was cloned as a modifier of olfactory gene expression  <cit> . two alleles from that study, kin- <dig> and kin- <dig>  result from a  <dig> bp deletion, which is replaced by sequence found on lg x, and a missense mutation in the kinase domain, respectively  <cit> .

kin- <dig> encodes a predicted serine-threonine kinase. within its kinase domain, kin- <dig> is homologous to members of the elkl motif kinase  family and salt-induced kinase family . members of the emk family include c. elegans par- <dig>  drosophila par- <dig>  s. pombe kin- <dig>  and mammalian mark   <cit> . emk family members have been shown to affect cell polarity as well as microtubule stability  <cit> . the kinase domain of kin- <dig> also shows significant homology salt-induced kinases  <cit> . salt induced kinases  were cloned from subtractive libraries derived from genes expressed in the adrenal glands after high salt diets in rat. the biological function of these kinases is not clear. the c-terminal domain of kin- <dig> is more divergent and shows little homology with domains in other kinases.

kin- <dig> encodes a functional kinase
in order to assess whether kin- <dig> acts as a functional kinase, 293t cells were transfected with either c-terminal flag-tagged full length kin- <dig> or various constructs, which truncate the carboxy terminal region of the protein. as controls, both the kinase active and kinase inactive mammalian tgfβ type ii rsk were also transfected. lysates were immuniprecipitated with anti-flag antibody and in vitro kinase assays performed. we observe that full length kin- <dig> is capable of autophophorylation . however, when we truncate the c-terminal domain, we find that the kinase domain, along with the ubiquitin-associated domain  or the kinase domain  are no longer capable of autophosphorylation. lysine  <dig> is a conserved residue essential for catalytic function in kinases. this indicates that the c-terminal domain is required for autophosphorylation. the c-terminal domain could be required for kinase activity or it may simply be the substrate for autophosphorylation. lanjuin and colleagues have previously shown that animals possessing a mutation  in the kinase domain have a small body size  <cit> , indicating that the kinase domain is required for proper body size.

placement of kin- <dig> in the sma/mab pathway
epistasis between kin- <dig> and dbl- <dig> or lon- <dig> was examined in order to determine the relationship between kin- <dig> and sma/mab pathway signaling. double mutant analysis between several of the known pathway components and lon- <dig> results in animals that are long   <cit> , making it the most downstream gene in the pathway. we examined lon-1; kin- <dig> double mutants to determine whether kin- <dig> can be placed in a similar position in the pathway as the current sma/mab components. we find that double mutants are longer than the single mutants of kin- <dig>  suggesting that lon- <dig> suppresses the sma phenotype of kin- <dig> .

next, we examined the relationship between dbl- <dig> and kin- <dig>  over-expression of dbl- <dig> results in lon animals, suggesting more ligand causes an increase in the tgfβ signal output. when dbl- <dig> over-expressing animals are crossed into sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> or daf- <dig> mutant backgrounds, the lon phenotype is suppressed  <cit>  and the animals are sma. this places the type i receptor and the smads downstream of the ligand, dbl- <dig>  when dbl- <dig> is over-expressed in a kin- <dig> background, the animals are also sma . additionally, using a weak allele of sma- <dig>  we generated a sma-6unc4; kin- <dig> double mutant and examined its body size. we find that these animals are similar in size to that observed for sma-6unc <dig> mutants alone suggesting that sma- <dig> and kin- <dig> may not function in parallel pathways . this indicates that kin- <dig> behaves in a manner consistent with known sma/mab pathway signaling molecules and is likely to function within this signaling cascade.

since lon- <dig> is genetically downstream of the sma/mab pathway signaling, we examined whether lon- <dig> mrna levels are altered in kin- <dig> mutants. we have previously shown that lon- <dig> mrna levels are up-regulated in sma- <dig> mutants and down-regulated in animals that over-express dbl- <dig>  <cit> . to test whether lon- <dig> mrna is regulated in kin- <dig> animals, we examined lon- <dig> mrna levels in a kin- <dig> background . kin- <dig> animals show an increase in the expression level of the lon- <dig> transcript. this increase is comparable to that previously observed in sma- <dig> mutant animals  <cit> .

kin- <dig> has been shown to affect the expression of a subset of olfactory receptor genes  <cit> . several olfactory receptors expressed in awb, ash and ask sensory neurons were either reduced or up-regulated in the kin- <dig> mutant background. given that kin- <dig> affects mrna levels of these olfactory receptors, we asked whether kin- <dig> alters the mrna expression levels of the sma/mab components. we examined sma- <dig> mrna expression  in a kin- <dig> background and find no changes in expression levels of sma- <dig> mrna. because kin- <dig> and dbl- <dig> expression patterns overlap, we examined mrna expression levels of dbl- <dig> in a kin- <dig> mutant background. we find that kin- <dig> does not affect dbl- <dig> mrna expression levels .

kin- <dig> expression is diverse and dynamic
in efforts to elucidate the function of kin- <dig> in tgfβ signaling, we examined its expression pattern. a construct consisting of the kin- <dig> promoter and coding region fused in frame to gfp was injected into kin- <dig> animals. as described above, this construct was able to rescue the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig> to wild-type . upon examination of the expression pattern, we observe kin- <dig> to be localized to various tissue types . most notably, kin- <dig> is seen in several neuronal cells in the head and tail throughout the course of development. several of the sensory neurons found in the head express kin- <dig>  including ash, afd and asi  <cit> . additional neuronal staining is observed in both can cells and the ventral nerve cord . we find expression both in pharyngeal and body wall muscle . during the l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> stages, we see expression throughout the intestine both in the nuclei and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm  and in cells in the tail . this intestinal expression is rarely seen in later stages of development. occasionally, expression is seen in vulval muscles as well.

hypodermal and neuronal expression of kin- <dig> rescues the small body size phenotype
in order to determine where kin- <dig> activity is required, we examined the body size of kin- <dig> animals transformed with constructs expressing kin- <dig> in specific tissues. elt- <dig> and rol- <dig> promoters drive expression in the hypodermis, while dbl- <dig> drives expression in a subset of neurons. all three promoters were fused to kin- <dig> genomic dna sequences. each of these constructs was injected into kin- <dig> animals and transgenic strains were analyzed for body size. several of the sma/mab pathway components, sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  and lon- <dig>  when specifically expressed in hypodermal tissues, rescue the body size defects associated with loss-of-function mutations in each of these genes  <cit> . using the rol- <dig> and elt- <dig> promoters to drive hypodermal expression of the genomic region of kin- <dig> results in rescue of the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig>  since kin- <dig> expression overlaps that of the sma/mab pathway ligand dbl- <dig> in the amphid neurons, ventral nerve cord, can cells and body wall muscle, we reasoned that kin- <dig> and dbl- <dig> may function together in the same tissues to regulate body size morphogenesis  <cit> . we find that kin- <dig> under the control of the dbl- <dig> promoter rescues the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig> animals . these data suggest that kin- <dig> functions in neuronal and hypodermal tissues to regulate body size morphogenesis .

kin- <dig> mutants are small, have delayed growth rates, and reduced brood sizes
the growth properties of sma/mab animals differ from other small animals. for example, mutants of the spectrin gene, sma- <dig>  which have been shown to affect embryonic elongation but not thought to be involved in tgfβ signaling, are approximately 50% the size of wild-type animals at hatching  <cit> . this is in contrast to the body size of l <dig> animals mutant in known sma/mab pathway components. for example, sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  dbl- <dig>  and lon- <dig> are indistinguishable in length from wild-type l <dig> animals at hatching  <cit> . this suggests that the sma/mab pathway components are defective in post-embryonic rather than embryonic stages of development. sma/mab pathway mutant animals grow at a slower rate as development progresses through the later larval stages into adulthood  <cit> . there is no defining switch during development that regulates body growth. we tested whether kin- <dig> mutations cause body size defects in a similar manner to sma/mab pathway mutations or whether kin- <dig> possessed embryonic defects. we examined the body size of kin- <dig> mutant animals in comparison to sma- <dig> and n <dig> animals at hatching and then at  <dig> hour intervals to  <dig> hours. we find that all three alleles of kin- <dig> are similar in length at the l <dig> stage to n <dig> animals. this is also what we observe for sma- <dig> which suggests that kin- <dig> delays growth post-embryonically, as do sma/mab pathway components . the sma body size of kin- <dig> is therefore due to a delay in development in later larval stages.

in addition, we find that kin- <dig> grows more slowly than n <dig> and sma/mab pathway mutants do. animals hatched and grown at 20°c were scored based on their developmental stage after  <dig> hours. we find that 99% of wild-type animals are adults at this time point, while only 2% of kin- <dig> animals are adults . lanjuin and colleagues report a similar observation; 98% of wild-type animals hatched and grown at 25°c for  <dig> days were adults in comparison to approximately 24% of kin- <dig> animals  <cit> . we asked if lon- <dig> could suppress the developmental delay characteristic of kin- <dig> animals . lon- <dig> mutants on their own show a slight delay in development, but which is distinguishable from the sma/mab mutants. in the double mutant lon-1;kin- <dig>  we find that the developmental defect of kin- <dig> can be partially suppressed by lon- <dig>  this result is consistent with our conclusion that lon- <dig> is genetically downstream of kin- <dig> 

number of animals scored is shown in parentheses.

we observed that sma/mab pathway mutants have a reduced brood size. in addition to the developmental defects, kin- <dig> also has a reduced brood size . like sma- <dig> and lon- <dig>  kin- <dig> shows a brood size approximately 30% the size of that seen in wild-type animals. we find that sma- <dig> and lon- <dig> along with kin- <dig> and kin- <dig> have a reduction in brood size as well. although brood size is affected, embryonic survival rate appears to be normal.

number of eggs scored for each genotype is shown in parentheses.

kin- <dig> affects dauer pathway signaling
several components of the sma/mab pathway have been shown to genetically interact with members of the dauer pathway  <cit> . the dauer-constitutive  phenotype of the type i receptor daf- <dig> is enhanced by mutations in sma- <dig>  at 15°c, daf- <dig> mutant strains exhibit a very weak dauer-constitutive phenotype. however, sma-6; daf- <dig> mutants show a 50% increase in the number of dauered animals at 15°c  <cit> . in addition, double mutants between the ligand daf- <dig> and either dbl- <dig> or sma- <dig> also have been shown to enhance the weak daf-c phenotype of daf- <dig> at 20°c  <cit> . these data suggest that there is some crosstalk between the sma/mab pathway and the tgfβ-like daf- <dig> dauer pathway.

based on these findings, we examined the effects of the kin- <dig> alleles on dauer formation. double homozygotes were made between daf- <dig> and each of the three alleles of kin- <dig>  genetic interactions were analyzed at 15°c, 20°c and 25°c. for comparison, daf- <dig> mutants raised at 25°c show almost 100% dauered animals compared to no dauered animals at 15°c or 20°c. at 15°c and 20°c, kin- <dig> is able to enhance dauer formation of daf- <dig> similar to the enhancement observed in sma-6; daf- <dig> mutant animals . we also see that kin- <dig> shows a weak enhancement of dauer formation while the missense mutant kin- <dig> shows no genetic interaction at all. these results are consistent with genetic interactions previously observed between sma/mab and dauer pathway components. however, at 25°c, we find that kin- <dig> can also suppress the constitutive dauer formation of daf- <dig>  kin- <dig> and kin- <dig> are able to suppress the daf-c defects of daf- <dig> while kin- <dig> does not .

discussion
kin- <dig> functions in hypodermal and neuronal tissues to regulate body size
expression of the sma/mab pathway components in the hypodermis is sufficient to rescue the body size defects seen in mutants. specific expression of sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and lon- <dig> in the hypodermal tissues has been shown to restore body length in these respective mutant animals  <cit> . this implies that body size is regulated largely via hypodermal function. our work presented here further supports that c. elegans body size is regulated in hypodermal tissues. when the genomic region of kin- <dig> is specifically expressed in the hypodermis, under the control of the elt- <dig> and rol- <dig> promoters, we see that the small body size phenotype of kin- <dig> is partially rescued. although kin- <dig> functions in the hypodermis to regulate body size morphogenesis, we do not see kin-29::gfp, under the control of its own promoter, expressed in the hypodermal tissues, suggesting that kin- <dig> expression levels are relatively low in these tissues.

dbl- <dig> is expressed primarily in neurons, which includes several amphid and pharyngeal neurons, ventral nerve cord, and can cells  <cit> . since kin- <dig> expression closely parallels that seen for dbl- <dig>  we also examined whether the dbl- <dig> promoter driving kin- <dig> genomic sequences is capable of rescuing the body size defect of kin- <dig>  when kin- <dig> is expressed in the same tissues as dbl- <dig>  we observe partial rescue of the small body size defect seen in kin- <dig> animals. it has been demonstrated that kin- <dig> under the control of the unc- <dig> and odr- <dig> promoters is able to rescue the body size defect of kin- <dig> mutant animals  <cit> . unc- <dig> is expressed in all neuronal cells while odr- <dig> is expressed in a subset of the sensory neurons including the afd neurons where dbl- <dig> and kin- <dig> are also expressed  <cit> . this suggests that neuronal expression of kin- <dig> is also sufficient to regulate body size morphogenesis. determining how this occurs will require further study.

kin- <dig> is a tissue specific factor that affects the sma/mab pathway
mutations in the ligand dbl- <dig>  the receptors sma- <dig> and daf- <dig>  and smads sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and sma- <dig>  result in animals that are approximately 70% the size of wild-type animals  <cit> . additional defects are seen as male tail ray fusions and crumpled spicules. however, the negatively regulated sma/mab target gene lon- <dig>  suppresses the small body size phenotype of sma- <dig>  sma- <dig>  sma- <dig> and sma- <dig> but not the male tail defects observed in each of these loss-of-function mutants  <cit> . this implies that sma/mab pathway signaling may branch downstream of the smads to regulate a subset of genes that control body size morphogenesis while others specifically affect male tail development. we find that kin- <dig> animals do not posses ray fusions or crumpled spicules and may exert its effects upstream of this branch point in the signaling pathway. in addition, we see that lon- <dig> is genetically downstream of kin- <dig> and that kin- <dig> suppresses the lon phenotype associated with over expression of dbl- <dig>  taken together, this data suggests that kin- <dig> may function in tissues with sma/mab pathway components to regulate body size but not male tail formation.

the emk kinase family and kin-29
members of the emk family have been shown to affect cell polarity and microtubule stability. mammalian mark phosphorylates microtubule associated proteins and has been shown to destabilize microtubules when over expressed in cho cells  <cit> . drosophila par- <dig> influences the cytoskeletal organization of the oocyte  <cit> . in wild-type drosophila oocytes, the microtubules are arranged in an anterior to posterior gradient with no microtubules observed at the most posterior region of the oocyte. microtubules in drosophila par- <dig> mutants, however, are organized around the cortex of the oocyte. in this reorganization, microtubules are now observed in the most posterior region of the oocyte. in addition, posterior localization of drosophila oskar is dependent on microtubule polarity. oskar is mislocalized in dpar- <dig> mutants, further supporting the involvement of dpar- <dig> in regulating microtubule dynamics. c. elegans par- <dig> regulates the early asymmetrical cell divisions of the embryo but has not been shown to have any affects on the microtubule network  <cit> . kin- <dig> only shows homology to the emk family members within its n-terminal kinase domain, indicating that kin- <dig> is a more distantly related member of the emk family. however, lack of homology between the c-termini of kin- <dig> and emk family proteins suggests that kin- <dig> activity may diverge from that observed for members of this family.

how does kin- <dig> function?
we have observed that kin- <dig> functions in both neuronal and hypodermal tissues. how kin- <dig> functions in each of these tissues to regulate body size morphogenesis is unclear. since kin- <dig> encodes a kinase it might act to regulate the activities of a variety of molecules that affect sma/mab pathway signaling. recently, it has been shown that several olfactory receptors are misexpressed in kin- <dig> animals, suggesting that kin- <dig> may regulate proper expression levels of various genes  <cit> . one model is that kin- <dig> phosphorylates a transcription factor and/or co-factor, which leads to the transcriptional mis-regulation of some component important for sma/mab pathway signaling. we have examined the expression levels of the sma/mab ligand dbl- <dig> and the type i rsk sma- <dig> and do not see any alteration in their levels of expression. however, this does not rule out that other genes that impinge on pathway signaling might be affected at the transcriptional level in neurons and hypodermal cells. alternatively, kin- <dig> may function in microtubule dynamics as described above  <cit> . kin- <dig> might therefore influence microtubule  organization in both neuronal and hypodermal tissues and affect sma/mab pathway signaling in each of these cell types.

dauer interactions show that kin- <dig> mutants may not sense external cues properly
we have shown that kin- <dig> helps to promote dauer formation at 25°c and to suppress dauer formation at 15°c. ttx- <dig>  a lim homeobox gene, shows a similar genetic interaction with daf- <dig>  <cit> . like kin- <dig>  ttx- <dig> single mutants do not affect dauer formation. daf-7; ttx- <dig> double mutant animals show an enhanced daf-c phenotype of daf- <dig> at 15°c while suppressing it at 25°c. in wild-type animals, high temperatures contribute to dauer formation, while lower temperatures suppress dauer formation. ttx- <dig> decouples both hot and cold inputs from the dauer pathway, and kin- <dig> may act similarly  <cit> . tph- <dig>  a tryptophan hydroxylase involved in the synthesis of serotonin, has been shown to form 10– <dig> % dauers in the presence of food and this defect is not dependent on temperature which implicates serotonergic signaling in modulating temperature sensitive dauer arrest  <cit> . tph- <dig> is also able to enhance the constitutive dauer phenotype of daf- <dig> mutants at 15°c similar to the enhancement observed for kin- <dig>  <cit> . sze and colleagues did not examine the affects of tph- <dig> mutants on daf- <dig> at 25°c. they did show, however, that over-expression of tph- <dig> in a daf- <dig> background at 25°c suppresses the daf-c phenotype of daf- <dig>  this is opposite to what we observe for kin- <dig>  although there are some similarities between tph- <dig> and kin- <dig>  tph-1; kin- <dig> double mutants are synthetic-daf at 20°c and 25°c suggesting that kin- <dig> may not function in a linear pathway with tph- <dig> but rather parallel to tph- <dig>  <cit> . tph- <dig> has also been shown to regulate the expression of daf- <dig> while kin- <dig> does not, suggesting that kin- <dig> functions downstream or in parallel to daf- <dig> production to affect tgfβ signaling outputs  <cit> . kin- <dig> may partly influence dauer formation through a serotonin mediated pathway and a non-serotonin mediated pathway such as the sma/mab pathway. the sma/mab pathway has been shown to influence dauer formation in combination with the tgfβ-like daf- <dig> pathway  <cit> .

starved animals are smaller than animals grown with abundant food supplies, indicating that environmental conditions influence body size morphogenesis  <cit> . drosophila s <dig> kinase mutants are smaller in body size due to decreased cell size, which is similar to the body size defect observed in nutrient deprived flies  <cit> . it is thought that s <dig> kinase alters cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors by regulating the efficiency of the translational apparatus  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that a deletion found within the c. elegans homolog of s <dig> kinase  also results in a reduced body size in the adult stage . s <dig> kinase  and kin- <dig> animals also show other similar phenotypes, including reduced brood size and slow growth defects. in addition, fat accumulation is also observed in s <dig> kinase  animals similar to that observed in dauered animals. previously, it has been demonstrated that animals that show pheromone hypersensitivity are unable to sense food or temperature signals properly  <cit> . recently, kin- <dig> mutants have been shown to be hypersensitive to pheromone  <cit> . in addition, kin- <dig> mutants also possess hyperforaging activity in the presence of abundant food supplies  <cit> . hyperforaging is normally observed in animals that have been deprived of food. these defects suggest that kin- <dig> mutant animals may not sense food or temperature signals properly and this may influence body size regulation. taken together, this evidence supports an environmental role in regulation of body size. kin- <dig> may function to transmit these environmental cues to the sma/mab tgfβ signaling pathway, thereby affecting proper body size morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, kin- <dig> was identified in a genetic screen designed to identify modifiers of body size in c. elegans. mutants in kin- <dig> result in small animals, and we show that kin- <dig> affects the dbl- <dig> signaling pathway in c. elegans. kin- <dig> also modifies phenotypes from a second tgfβ pathway in c. elegans, the dauer pathway. further, we show that kin- <dig> does contain kinase activity, and that it is capable of phosphorylating itself. kin- <dig> functions in neurons and in the hypodermis to control aspects of body size.
