BACKGROUND
for over  <dig> years, the alpha-proteobacterium caulobacter crescentus has been an important model organism for the study of bacterial development, physiology and cell cycle biology. c. crescentus exhibits a cyclical, dimorphic lifestyle that is atypical among prokaryotes  <cit> . its sessile form displays an adhesive polar holdfast, or stalk, and this cell type is exclusively capable of dna replication and cell division. cell division in c. crescentus is asymmetrical, and stalked cells divide to produce motile daughter “swarmer” cells with a single polar flagellum and multiple polar pili. the swarmer cells are unable to divide or replicate their dna until they shed their flagellum and pili and undergo a physical transformation to the stalked cell morphotype. c. crescentus is also unusual in that its dna replication is closely coordinated with cell division, resulting in the production of a single copy of the bacterial chromosome per division cycle. the regulatory networks that control differentiation and division have been well characterized  <cit> .

caulobacter phages were first isolated nearly  <dig> years ago  <cit>  and have been instrumental as tools for genetic transduction  <cit>  and as probes for the presence of cell-cycle specific markers  <cit> . among the phages of c. crescentus, the most extensively studied are large, virulent siphophages with prolate heads, among which phicbk is the archetype. first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , phicbk has been used as a cell-cycle and morphological indicator  <cit>  because it uses the flagellum and polar pili of the swarmer cell for adsorption  <cit> . in addition, phicbk, due to its large size, was one of the earliest phages for which the fine structure of the capsid was determined by electron microscopic image reconstruction  <cit>  and was the first instance where the phage head-tail symmetry mismatch was demonstrated  <cit> . phage phicbk and related phages have been shown to have a unique filamentous structure emanating from the top vertex of the capsid  <cit> . this head filament was found to mediate primary attachment of the virion to the flagellum and thus more efficient adsorption to the swarmer cell  <cit> . however, despite the biological and structural significance of c. crescentus phages, little is known about the biology of the phages themselves. here we report the complete genomes of phage phicbk and five related caulobacter siphophages. the results are discussed in terms of the unique structure of these phages and the biological imperatives facing phages that infect bacterial species with dimorphic cell types.

methods
phage isolation and culture
phage phicbk and c. crescentus strain cb <dig> were obtained from the félix d’hérelle reference center for bacterial viruses , and strain cb <dig> was used for the enrichment and propagation of all phage isolates. c. crescentus was cultured at 30°c with aeration in pye broth ,  <dig> g/l yeast extract ,  <dig>  g/l anhydrous mgso4) or pye agar . phages were propagated and enumerated on pye plates by the soft agar overlay method  <cit>  using lawns consisting of  <dig> ml pye top agar  and inoculated with  <dig> μl of an overnight pye culture of c. crescentus cb <dig>  after plating, lawns were incubated for 42– <dig> h at 30°c prior to plaque enumeration or harvesting.

phages other than phicbk were isolated in early  <dig> from surface water samples collected in bryan and college station, tx, usa by students enrolled in the phage genomics for undergraduates program run at texas a&m university. phages were isolated following culture enrichment or direct concentration methods. in culture enrichment of water samples,  <dig> ml of filter-sterilized water sample  was added to  <dig> ml of 5x strength pye broth, inoculated with  <dig> μl of a fresh c. crescentus cb <dig> overnight pye culture and incubated with aeration overnight at 30°c. enrichment cultures were centrifuged , the supernatants filter sterilized  and plated to lawns of c. crescentus cb <dig>  and observed for plaque formation. the direct concentration method was modified from a technique kindly provided by r. hendrix, university of pittsburgh . briefly,  <dig> l of water sample was clarified by filtration through whatman 597½ paper . five grams of whatman de- <dig> anion exchange resin was added and incubated at 22°c for  <dig> min with shaking. the resin was collected in a  <dig> ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at  <dig>  x g,  <dig> min, 22°c and the supernatant discarded. the resin was washed twice by resuspension in  <dig> ml wash buffer  followed by centrifugation as above. phage were eluted from the resin by addition of  <dig> ml elution buffer  followed by centrifugation as above, and the supernatant was retained and concentrated to a final volume of ~ <dig> μl in a  <dig> kda nwco centrifugal ultrafiltration device . this total phage concentrate was then plated to lawns of c. crescentus cb <dig> and observed for plaque formation. individual plaques were picked and subcultured three times, then propagated to high-titer lysates in soft agar overlays  <cit> .

phage dna preparation and sequencing
bacteriophage genomic dna was prepared from 10– <dig> ml of filter-sterilized, high-titer  phage lysates using a modified form of the promega wizard dna clean-up kit  as described previously  <cit> . dna integrity was verified by running on a  <dig> % agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide and dna was quantified by band densitometry. phage genome size was estimated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  analysis of genomic dna on a 1% agarose gel  and comparison to a size marker .

phage genomic dna was mixed in equimolar amounts and sequenced as mid-labeled pools by  <dig> pyrosequencing  at the emory gra genome center . trimmed flx titanium flowgram outputs were assembled using the newbler assembler version  <dig> . <dig>  or  <dig> . <dig>  at default settings. contigs were confirmed to be complete by pcr, using primers that faced off each end of the contigs and sequencing of the resulting products. phage phicbk was sequenced to 181-fold average coverage, colossus to 74-fold coverage, rogue to 38-fold coverage, swift to 59-fold coverage, karma to 291-fold coverage and magneto to 83-fold coverage. in all cases, the phage genomes produced circular assemblies. breakpoints in sequencing coverage were determined by manual inspection of contigs in clc workbench version  <dig>  .

terminal labeling of genomic dna
in order to locate the physical termini of the phicbk chromosome, whole phage genomic dna was ligated with a short oligonucleotide tag of known sequence and this product resequenced by pyrosequencing as described above. in principle, the oligo tag will ligate to the physical chromosomal termini and the boundary between the tag sequence and the phage genomic sequence will indicate the original physical ends of the phage chromosome. genomic dna of phage phicbk was end-repaired with the nebnext end repair module  using  <dig> μg of dna and  <dig> μl of enzyme in a  <dig> μl reaction according to the manufacturer’s protocol. end-repaired dna was precipitated by addition of  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> volumes of ethanol, and resuspended in  <dig> μl water. a  <dig> bp dsdna oligonucleotide  was added to the genomic dna at a 25: <dig> molar ratio and ligated at 16°c for  <dig> h with t <dig> dna ligase  in a  <dig> μl reaction volume. the ligase was heat inactivated , dna precipitated with nacl and ethanol as described above, resuspended in  <dig> μl water and submitted for sequencing by  <dig> pyrosequencing. all reads from this resequencing run containing the complete  <dig> bp oligo sequence were extracted from the sequencing output and assembled onto the previously established phicbk genomic sequence to locate hotspots of tag ligation.

genome annotation
genes were predicted using genemark.hmm  <cit>  and glimmer  <dig>  <cit>  and gene starts manually edited in artemis  <cit> . trna genes were predicted by trnascan-se  <dig>   <cit>  and rfam  <cit> , and rho-independent terminators predicted by transtermhp  <cit> . proteins were exported and analyzed in batch by blastp  <cit> ; protein functional characteristics were predicted by batch analysis of all proteins in interproscan version  <dig>   <cit> . proteins of particular interest were additionally analyzed by hhpred searches against the pdb70_18aug <dig> database  <cit> , tmhmm , lipop  <dig>   <cit> , and the emboss package  <cit> . intergenomic protein comparisons were conducted via rast  <cit>  using phicbk or colossus as the reference genome and a similarity cutoff of 25%, and variably conserved proteins were grouped by ncbi blastclust at settings of l= <dig> , s= <dig>  figures were generated using circos version  <dig>   <cit>  and dna master .

sequence deposition
the names of novel phage isolates were prefixed with ccr, which is the rebase species acronym for c. crescentus . completed phage genomes were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: phicbk, jx100813; ccrmagneto, jx100812; ccrswift, jx100809; ccrkarma, jx100811; ccrrogue, jx100814; ccrcolossus, jx <dig>  for simplicity, the phage names will be used without the ccr prefix.

proteomic analysis
phage phicbk was propagated in  <dig> l pye liquid culture at 30°c to a titer of ~ <dig> pfu/ml. phage lysate was clarified by two rounds of centrifugation  and the phage-containing supernatant was digested with  <dig> μg/ml dnase i and rnase a  for  <dig> h at 22°c. phage was concentrated by pelleting in a centrifuge  and the pellet was resuspended in λ-dil buffer . residual cell debris was removed from the phage suspension by centrifugation  and the phage were then banded by isopycnic cscl gradient ultracentrifugation, dialyzed and concentrated as described previously  <cit> . the phage preparation was diluted in λ-dil, boiled for  <dig> min and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml dnase i for  <dig> h at 37°c to reduce sample viscosity. samples were then mixed with laemmli sample buffer , boiled for  <dig> min and the equivalent of  <dig> x  <dig> to  <dig> x  <dig> pfu/lane were run on a 10% tris-glycine sds-page gel by standard methods  <cit> . bands were visualized with coomassie blue, and the entire gel lane with the exception of the dye front was segmented based on band boundaries. all gel segments, containing visible bands or unstained inter-band regions, were subjected to proteomic analysis as described previously  <cit> . alternatively, digested samples were injected into a waters nanoacquity system for uplc separation of peptic peptides. separation was achieved after the peptides were trapped and desalted on a vanguard pre-column trap  for  <dig> min. peptides were eluted from the trap using an 2%–40% linear gradient of acetonitrile over  <dig> min at a flow rate of  <dig>  μl/min and were separated using an acquity uplc beh c <dig>  <dig>  μm  <dig>  ×  <dig> mm column. peptides that were produced from the enzymatic cleavage were identified from the using waters mse technology on a waters synapte g <dig> instrument and proteinlynx global server  searches of a customized database.

transmission electron microscopy
phages were prepared for microscopy by the valentine method  <cit>  and stained with 2%  uranyl acetate. grids were viewed in a jeol  <dig> ex transmission electron microscope under  <dig> kv accelerating voltage. five virions of each phage were measured and these data used to calculate mean dimensions.

RESULTS
phage and genome characteristics
phages magneto, swift, karma, rogue and colossus were isolated from surface waters; magneto, swift, rogue and colossus were obtained by the culture enrichment method, and phage karma was isolated by the direct concentration method. electron microscopic analysis of these phages revealed that all five possessed similar siphoviridae morphology to the previously described phicbk, with long, non-contractile tails and large prolate heads of varying lengths . the phage phicbk head measured  <dig> nm long and  <dig> nm wide with a tail length of  <dig> nm, dimensions which are in good agreement with previously reported measurements  <cit> . phage dimensions are summarized in table 1; all of the phages exhibited similar dimensions to that of phage phicbk except for colossus, which had a considerably longer head and slightly longer tail than the other phages.

aphage physical dimensions are the means of measurements of five virions, bracketed values after each dimension indicate standard deviations.

bone boundary of the terminal repeat in colossus is indistinct, thus the repeat length is approximate.

cprotein-coding genes that were not detected in any of the other  <dig> phicbk-like phage genomes sequenced.

the genomes of these six phages were sequenced to completion by  <dig> pyrosequencing followed by manual closure, representing a total combined dna sequence of  <dig>  mb. the general characteristics of the phage genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  complete annotations and supporting evidence are provided as supplementary data in additional file 1: tables s <dig> - s <dig>  the unit genomes of these phages ranged from  <dig>  kb encoding  <dig> protein-coding genes  to  <dig> kb encoding  <dig> protein-coding genes , with terminal direct repeats of ~ <dig> kb in all phages except colossus, in which the terminal redundancy appeared to be closer to ~ <dig> kb. three major modules can be identified in these genomes . the phage structural protein module begins with the gene encoding the portal protein  at an apparent divergent transcription site and extends to slightly after a tail protein gene on the plus strand. a lysis cassette, encoding an endolysin, a holin and a two-component spanin protein immediately follows the structural module on the same strand. a dna metabolism and replication module is encoded on the minus strand, beginning at another divergent transcription site with an riia/riib gene pair  and extending to the end of the lysis cassette. these genomic features are described in greater detail in the following sections.

the gc content of the genomes were all close to the  <dig> % gc content of c. crescentus cb <dig>  each phage also encodes a large number of trna genes, ranging from  <dig> in rogue to  <dig> found in colossus; rfam analysis did not detect any functional rna elements other than trnas. each phage encodes trnas specific for  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids; thr and tyr trnas are not found in any phage, asn and his are found only in colossus, and ala is found only in magneto, swift and colossus. phage phicbk is the only phage to lack an arg trna, while rogue lacks asp and ser. codon usage was analyzed for phages phicbk and colossus, and this analysis suggests the phage-encoded trnas may aid the phage by supplying additional trnas specific for codons most commonly used by the phage. in the case of phicbk, the  <dig> codons represented by phage-encoded trnas specified 58% of the total amino acid residues encoded by phage proteins; in colossus the  <dig> codons with corresponding phage trnas specified 50% of residues.

relationships of the phicbk-like phages
based on analyses of dna similarity , phages phicbk, karma, magneto and swift were found to form a tightly cohesive group , with rogue slightly less related  and colossus more distantly related . because of these relationships, the phage genomes will be discussed in the context of either phicbk or colossus, as phicbk is representative of phages karma, magneto, swift and rogue. comparison of the more closely related phages phicbk, karma, magneto, swift and rogue at the protein level  shows that these phages are largely syntenic, with few gene translocations. gene insertions and deletions generally occur singly or as discrete groups of 2– <dig> genes. phages karma, magneto, swift and rogue contain a cluster of 7– <dig> additional genes inserted between phicbk genes  <dig> and  <dig>  aside from the presence of a putative dna-binding protein , the function of this region is unknown. due to its more distant relationship to the other phages, the protein-coding genes of colossus were compared to phage phicbk separately. of  <dig> predicted proteins in phage colossus,  <dig>  do not have any homologs in the other five phicbk-like phages. nevertheless, as shown in figure  <dig>  colossus is still largely syntenic with phicbk. the regions of greatest protein conservation occur in the central portion of the genomes, which contain the predicted structural and dna replication proteins . large sections at the left and right ends of the genomes, primarily containing proteins of unknown function, are less well conserved. these sections contain the majority of gene insertions and deletions, and also several apparent gene translocations and duplications . phage phicbk genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appear to be directly duplicated in colossus, and colossus genes  <dig> and  <dig> are duplicated in phicbk. in the case of phicbk gp <dig> one of the duplicates, colossus gene  <dig>  is also significantly diverged and translocated to a position ~ <dig> kb upstream of its paralog, the colossus major capsid protein gene  <dig> .

while these phages are related to one another, a striking feature of the phicbk-like phages is the lack of any meaningful relationship to other described organisms, including other phages. in the case of phage phicbk,  <dig> of its  <dig> predicted proteins, or 75%, have no matches  to proteins in the ncbi nr database. similarly, in phage colossus,  <dig> proteins  do not have any detectable homologs in the nr database. the phage most closely related to phicbk is phijl <dig> , a slightly prolate siphophage that infects an uncharacterized marine alphaproteobacterium strain  <cit> . this relationship however is extremely distant, as even in this case only seven phicbk proteins,  mostly located in the phage tail structural region, are detectably related to phijl <dig> proteins, with  <dig>  –  <dig> % identity. these proteins in themselves do not appear to form a cohesive evolutionary module; for example the phijl <dig> portal homolog gp <dig>  is most closely related to proteins found in bordetella genomes, while the tail protein homolog gp <dig>  has a homolog located in polymorphum gilvum. three of these proteins, gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig>  are related to gene transfer agent proteins orfg <dig> , orfg <dig>  and orfg <dig>  of rhodobacter capsulatus <cit>  , suggesting some very distant relationship between the phicbk-like phages and these phage-like gene transfer agents.

due to frequent horizontal gene transfer events, the concept of biological species or hierarchical lineages in the classical linnaean sense are difficult to apply to phages  <cit> . the model of “phage type” has been proposed, which groups phages based on shared features of genome organization and function  <cit> . protein or dna sequence relationships have been used to organize phages into groups that appear to have biological meaning , however in all of these cases the enormous diversity of phages results in numerous phage groups with no obvious evolutionary linkage to each other. while the phicbk-like phages lack obvious relationships to any other described organisms, they are obviously related to each other;  <dig> proteins were found to be conserved in all six genomes. these conserved proteins form syntenic blocks and are primarily located in the phage structural, lysis and dna replication modules , suggesting these constitute the core genes of the phicbk phage type. given the lack of any clear relationship to any other described phages, we propose phage phicbk as the founder of a novel phage type, the phicbk-like phages, which includes phages magneto, swift, karma, rogue and colossus as its inaugural members, with the latter perhaps the founder of a sub-type.

determination of genomic termini
following closure, the phage phicbk genome produced a circular assembly of  <dig>  bp. however, the sequence contigs assembled from pyrosequencing reads possessed a  <dig>  bp region of significantly higher sequence coverage than the rest of the genome. at the boundaries of this region, sequence coverage abruptly transitioned from approximately 170-fold to over 360-fold between two base positions, and coverage of this region was on average  <dig> -fold greater than the rest of the sequence. this suggested that the high coverage region was a large terminal repeat of ~ <dig> kbp, as found in the classical coliphage t <dig>  <cit> . to test this notion, the phicbk genomic dna was subjected to terminal labeling analysis to determine the physical ends of the phage genome. this procedure retrieved  <dig> pyrosequencing reads containing the complete oligo tag sequence, of which  <dig> assembled to the established phicbk genome. fifteen of these  <dig> reads assembled to two distinct loci on the phicbk genome, with the boundaries of the oligo sequence and the phage genomic sequence corresponding exactly to the boundaries of the high-coverage region identified in the phicbk assembly. the remaining  <dig> sequencing reads assembled to various loci across the genome, which we interpret as tag ligation to double-stranded dna breaks generated during the dna isolation procedure, or possibly termini generated by aberrant packaging events. these experimental data were interpreted as a confirmation of the presence and location of long direct terminal repeats in the phicbk genome, and the genome was therefore reopened accordingly as shown in figure  <dig> 

the left terminus of the physical genome lies within codon  <dig> of the predicted terminase large subunit gene, while the right terminus resides in a predicted non-coding region between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in a  <dig>  bp direct repeat. phages swift, magneto, karma and rogue exhibited similar abrupt discontinuities in sequencing coverage to that of phage phicbk, indicating that these phages possess direct terminal repeats similar to that of phicbk. in all five cases these coverage transition boundaries were of identical or nearly identical nucleotide sequence to that found in phicbk , with the left boundary in all cases lying within codon  <dig> of the large terminase gene, and the right boundary within an intergenic region ~ <dig> kb downstream. given these similarities, the genomes of phages swift, magneto, karma and rogue were also reopened and annotated to reflect the presence of these repeats. the sizes of the terminal repeat regions in these phage genomes are summarized in table  <dig> 

like the other phicbk-like phages, colossus exhibited an abrupt transition at the left end of a high-coverage region, but instead of an equally abrupt reduction at the end of a discrete length of sequence, a more gradual transition was observed, spanning ~  <dig> bp from high to normal coverage on the right end. in this case the left boundary is in a non-coding region slightly downstream of the large terminase gene, and the right boundary lies within gene  <dig>  some  <dig>  bp downstream. thus, colossus possesses a non-permuted terminal repeat like the other phicbk-like phages, marking the initiation site for genome packaging. however, unlike the more closely related phicbk-like phages, where packaging terminates at the end of the terminal repeat, genome packaging in colossus appears to have a more imprecise termination and cleavage mechanism.

while all caudovirales phages package their dna into the capsid as a linear molecule, the nature of the genomic termini can be markedly different between phage types  <cit> . phage genomes may have non-permuted termini with short 3’ or 5’ overhangs , circularly permuted terminal redundancies , or non-permuted direct terminal repeats which can be either short  or long . some phages, like mu, have host dna at their termini, and the phi29-like phages have a covalently linked protein. characterizing these diverse modalities for dna packaging is crucial for understanding the biology of phages. in addition, there is practical significance, in that these mechanisms differ greatly in supporting generalized transduction, a feature of great utility for bacterial genetics but highly undesirable in phages being considered for therapeutic use  <cit> . with the advent of next-generation dna sequencing, a rate-limiting step in phage genomics is now the determination of the genomic termini, which must still largely be determined experimentally. this is especially true of phages with non-permuted terminal repeats: during sequence assembly, reads from each identical repeat are usually collapsed into a single region in the middle of the assembled contig, resulting in what can appear to be a circularly permuted genome. furthermore, determination of the true boundaries of direct repeats by traditional methods of restriction mapping and direct sequencing is laborious and time consuming  <cit> . here, simple quantification of coverage depth in the assembled contigs revealed the boundaries of non-permuted terminal repeats in these genomes. moreover, the terminal ligation method developed here confirmed these repeats and the position of the genomic termini in the phicbk genome, and the close dna sequence homology and similar coverage patterns  allowed high-confidence assignment of the termini in four of the other five phages. deep-sequencing coverage has been used to determine copy number variation in other genomic contexts , but the small size and low complexity of phage genomes allows for manual inspection of coverage patterns. the terminal ligation method used here is similar in principle to a previously described method based on cloning of restriction fragments following linker ligation  <cit> . the use of next-generation sequencing, however, removes the limitations imposed by restriction digestion of the dna, and thus should be applicable to mapping all forms of genomic termini. in principle this method can be run in parallel with the phage de novo sequencing run to obtain terminus information simultaneously with the genomic sequence.

terminase and dna packaging
the genes encoding the large subunit terminase  proteins of the phicbk-like phages are located at the far right end of the genomes . in all phages except colossus, the terl gene overlaps with the terminal repeat, generating an unusual architecture in which the c-terminal fragment of terl is duplicated in each repeat. the novel genes immediately upstream of terl  are predicted to encode small subunit terminase  proteins, based on their hhpred similarity to the ters-based pdb family 3zqp_a , and their position and size relative to terl. these proteins are conserved within the phicbk-like phages but otherwise do not have any homologs in the ncbi database detectable by blastp. phage ters proteins are generally less conserved and more difficult to predict by simple sequence homology than terl proteins.

the phicbk-like terl proteins contain an intein in the n-terminal portion of the protein, based on the detection of conserved intein domains by interproscan, including a hint domain  and intein splice site . inteins are self-splicing elements that post-translationally catalyze their own excision from the completed protein. based on alignments of the phicbk terl with its non-intein containing homologs, the putative intein appears to reside between k <dig> and s <dig>  residues which are adjacent and absolutely conserved in  <dig> related terl proteins . the intein sequence itself is predicted to contain the  <dig> residues inclusive of p <dig> to n <dig>  resulting in a  <dig> aa functional terl protein following splicing; these boundaries are annotated in the phage genome records. the c-terminal boundary of the intein, s <dig>  immediately follows the conserved his-asn residues often associated with the c-terminal intein-extein boundary  <cit> . while the n-terminal intein boundary does not possess the ser or cys residue involved in typical n-terminal intein cleavage, functional inteins with a pro at this position have been described  <cit> . interestingly, the n-terminal region of the mature terl protein is not related to other terl proteins, including those that share similarity in the c-terminal region. the n-terminal domain of the phicbk-like terl may be the result of a recombinational event that swapped this portion of the protein for a different domain, perhaps using the intein sequence to provide homologous dna for recombination.

the terl proteins of phicbk, swift, magneto and karma share 100% identity in amino acid sequence. the terl protein of rogue is 87% similar, while colossus is only 55% similar to that of phicbk. previous bioinformatic analysis of bacteriophage large subunit terminase proteins has shown that terl alleles can be grouped into families that correlate to the dna packaging style of the organism  <cit> . a mature version of these terl proteins, with the predicted inteins excised, was used for blast analysis and alignment. among the terl proteins of phages with known packaging types, the phicbk terl protein is most similar to that of phages aaΦ <dig>  and py <dig> . phage aaΦ <dig> has been shown to package dna that is circularly permuted and terminally redundant by  <dig> % of the phage genome  <cit> , and phage py <dig> packages its dna by a headful mechanism initiated at a defined pac site analogous to the mechanism employed by phage p <dig>  <cit> . given the low protein similarity of the phicbk terl to even its closest relatives, we propose that the terl proteins of phages phicbk, magneto, swift, karma and rogue constitute a novel terl class that packages phage dna via a mechanism of long direct terminal repeats in a manner similar to that of phages t <dig> or spo <dig>  <cit> . the terl homolog of phage colossus is distinctly diverged from the phicbk terl and appears to use a slightly altered packaging mechanism, based on analysis of its genomic termini as described above.

dna replication
the central portion of the phicbk genome contains a region of genes encoded predominantly on the minus strand, beginning approximately at position  <dig>  and ending at  <dig> , encompassing genes  <dig> through  <dig>  in phage colossus, this region spans position  <dig>  to  <dig> , including colossus genes  <dig> through  <dig>  this module appears to contain phage dna metabolism and replication functions, including predicted aerobic ribonucleoside reductase subunits , thymidylate synthase , a recd-like exov helicase , a dna pol iii-like ribonuclease  and a t7-like dna polymerase . the ribonucleoside reductase alpha subunit  contains an intein that spans c <dig> to n <dig> inclusive, featuring the commonly conserved cys residue at its n terminus and a relatively uncommon c-terminal gly-gln  <cit> , resulting in a mature  <dig> amino acid protein. this intein is also present in the colossus homolog gp <dig>  the only other organism containing this intein feature is invertebrate iridescent virus  <dig> . while the alpha subunit possesses significant similarity to other proteins in the database , the ribonucleoside reductase beta subunit  exhibits virtually no similarity to previously identified proteins. the beta subunit also contains a c-terminal thioredoxin-like domain , a domain architecture found only in the ribonucleoside reductase of vibrio cholerae phage icp <dig> .

an interesting feature of all six phicbk-like phages is the presence of a dna polymerase, gp <dig> in phicbk and gp <dig> in colossus, which closely resembles that of coliphage t <dig> and members of the t7-like phage superfamily. among the most closely related proteins to phicbk gp <dig> is the dna polymerase gp <dig> of phage t <dig> itself  which can be aligned to phicbk gp <dig> over its entire length. this relationship suggests that phicbk-like phages may replicate their dna in a manner similar to that of phage t <dig>  coliphage t <dig> employs a unique mechanism of dna replication, requiring only four proteins: a dna polymerase , a combination helicase-primase , a single-stranded dna binding protein , and thioredoxin which serves as dna polymerase processivity factor and is supplied by the e. coli host  <cit> . both the phicbk-like and t <dig> dna polymerases possess similar domain architectures, with an n-terminal ribonuclease-like domain  responsible for proofreading and c-terminal dna polymerase a domain . unlike other members of the pola family such as the e. coli dna pol i, which are low processivity enzymes involved in dna repair, t <dig> gp <dig> is responsible for replication of the phage chromosome with an associated high processivity of thousands of bp per event  <cit> . the high processivity of t <dig> gp <dig> is conferred in large part by its association with host thioredoxin  <cit> ; the thioredoxin-binding loop of t <dig> gp <dig>   <cit>  is present but extended by  <dig> aa in phicbk gp <dig>  thus the phicbk-like homologs may establish similar interactions with another protein to enhance their processivity. phage phicbk possesses a dna helicase , but this protein does not appear to contain a dna primase domain like that of t <dig> and is not related to t <dig> gp <dig> at the primary structure level. a single-stranded dna binding protein was not detected in the genome of phage phicbk or its relatives. if these phicbk-like phages replicate their dna in a manner similar to that of the t7-like phages, they may use host proteins to complete the dna replication complex. to our knowledge, this is the first instance of a t7-like dna polymerase appearing in a phage outside of the t <dig> superfamily.

phicbk gene  <dig>  encodes a homolog of the coliphage t <dig> a <dig> protein , located transcriptionally slightly upstream of the predicted dna polymerase . this is the second time that an a <dig> homolog has been detected outside of the known t5-like phages, with the only other instance in the genome of phijl <dig> . in t <dig>  the a <dig> protein is transcribed in the pre-early stage of infection as one of the eight genes of the first-step-transfer  dna, which corresponds to the left large terminal repeat. a <dig> mutants are defective in multiple processes, including failure to degrade host dna and to shut off t <dig> pre-early gene expression  <cit> , and to accomplish the transfer of the rest of the t <dig> genome into the cell  <cit> . oddly, a <dig> fractionates with the membrane fraction after treatment with rnase and dnase  <cit> . it also co-immunoprecipitates with host rna polymerase separated in glycerol gradients, and a1-bound rna polymerase molecules have altered transcription patterns on t <dig> dna  <cit> . the simplest notion is that a <dig> is a transcription factor that also interacts with a membrane protein. in support of this notion, the only t <dig> fst gene that encodes a predicted membrane protein is adjacent to a <dig>  in this perspective, the various diverse phenotypes of a <dig> mutants are derived from a failure to alter the promoter specificity during pre-early gene expression. because of their location in the phicbk-like phages within the dna replication module, it seems unlikely that these a <dig> homologs would play a role in dna degradation, and their function may be to alter phicbk gene expression via interaction with the host rna polymerase. this function is supported by an n-terminal similarity of these proteins to pdb family 1g2h_a  as detected by hhpred; 1g2h is based on the dna-binding domain of the tyrr transcription factor of haemophilus influenzae.

tyrosine recombinase proteins were identified in all six phicbk-like phages, in phage phicbk this protein is gp <dig>  site-specific tyrosine recombinases like gp <dig> are often associated with prophage integration. however, as there are no reports of phage phicbk exhibiting temperate behavior, it is most likely that the gp <dig> recombinase instead plays some role in the resolution of replicative intermediates or recombinational multimers of the phage chromosome. tyrosine recombinases of this type are well known to be involved in chromosomal segregation, as with e. coli xerc and xerd  <cit>  or the resolution of recombinational dimers, as with the cre protein of coliphage p <dig>  <cit> . at  <dig> aa, phicbk gp <dig> is also considerably smaller than other well-studied tyrosine recombinases such as phage lambda int  or p <dig> cre . phicbk gp <dig> is comprised of little more than the recombinase catalytic core which begins with r <dig>  the apparent equivalent of the catalytic r <dig> of cre  <cit> . the equivalent of the n-terminal clamp domain of cre appears to be absent in phicbk gp <dig>  suggesting it could require an accessory protein for this function.

phage structural proteins
the structural proteome of phage phicbk was analyzed by band excision from a sds-page gel followed by trypsin digestion and lc-ms/ms. as shown in table  <dig>  analysis of phicbk directly identified eight proteins associated with the virion. the structural proteins detected in phicbk are conserved in all six phicbk-like phages , indicating that despite differences in head length and genome composition, these phages are structurally very similar and likely share mechanisms of assembly and host adsorption.

aphicbk proteins were detected by proteomic analysis of purified virions;

the homologous proteins in the other phicbk-like phages are listed.

bphicbk gp <dig> is duplicated in phage colossus as gp <dig> and gp <dig> 

considerable study has been devoted to the structural proteins of phicbk. previous work by leonard et al. <cit>  has indicated the phicbk phage head is largely composed of two proteins: a major capsid protein of  <dig> kda, and a minor capsid protein of  <dig>  kda, assembled in a 1: <dig> ratio. a third, minor protein of  <dig> kda was also reported, with a stoichiometry suggesting a possible role as a head vertex protein. as shown in figure  <dig>  the major capsid protein , minor capsid protein  and putative vertex protein  exhibited molecular weights similar to those reported previously, and also correspond well to their calculated molecular weights. interestingly, the bands corresponding to the major capsid protein  and the putative vertex protein  were both identified as gp <dig>  suggesting that the band  <dig> protein is a processed form of the major capsid protein. in both bands  <dig> and  <dig>  peptide hits were identified that spanned from a <dig> to r <dig> of the  <dig> aa gp <dig> protein, leaving the possibility open for a cleavage event to occur somewhere in the n-terminal  <dig> or c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of this protein. the colossus gp <dig> major capsid protein is very similar  to phicbk gp <dig>  except that it is truncated by  <dig> residues at its n terminus with respect to phicbk gp <dig>  in figure  <dig>  the gp <dig> tail tube protein , with a predicted mw of  <dig>  kda, exhibits an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda which is slightly lower than the previously reported  <dig> kda  <cit> . the tail tape measure protein, phicbk gp <dig>  was identified with the virions and appears as band  <dig> in figure  <dig>  the lengths of phicbk gp <dig>  and its colossus homolog, gp <dig>  predict tail lengths of  <dig> nm for phicbk and  <dig> nm for colossus assuming the alpha-helical structure found in other phage tail tape measure proteins  <cit> . this is good agreement with the measured lengths of the tails of these phages . in many dsdna phages with long tails , the gene encoding the tape measure protein is preceded by a gene that encodes two tape measure chaperone proteins, one of which is an extended form of the other as specified by a programmed − <dig> translational frameshift  <cit> . in all six phages, a pre-tape measure chaperone protein  and its extended version  could be identified, with the frameshift site located in the slippery sequence 5’ - aaaaaac - 3’. in colossus, this slippery site is 5’ - gggaaac - 3’.

band  <dig> in figure  <dig> was identified as phicbk gp <dig>  a protein that contains a duf <dig> domain  but otherwise has no homologs detectable by blastp with experimentally confirmed functional annotations in the ncbi database. hhpred searches detected a strong relationship to pdb family 2jes_a , which is based on the phage spp <dig> portal protein. this annotation as the portal protein is supported by the positions of several gp <dig> homologs , bcepgomr  and se <dig> ), which are all located immediately downstream of their predicted terl, suggesting their function as portal proteins. the 12-member portal ring formed by the portal protein is the nucleus of phage capsid assembly and is also the docking site of the dna packaging complex  <cit> . because of their required intimate interactions with the terl protein, portal protein genes are often genetically coupled to the large terminase gene. a recent positional analysis of phage genomes found that the location of the large terminase gene immediately upstream of the portal-encoding gene to be common  <cit> . in the phicbk-like phages, this arrangement appears to be disrupted as the portal gene is located 18– <dig> kb downstream from terl.

phage phicbk preferentially adsorbs to the swarmer cell type  <cit> , as stalked cells lack the both the flagellar apparatus and pili  <cit>  required for adsorption. phage phicbk is known to adsorb to its host cell via a two-step process  <cit> . first, a filament extending from the apical vertex of the phage head associates with the rotating bacterial flagellum; this attachment is not strictly required for phage adsorption, but flagellar defects reduce adsorption efficiency by ~3-fold. flagellar rotation brings the phage into close proximity to the cell pole, where the phage tail tip adsorbs to the cell at the site of the pilus portal and completes the infection process. because of their similar genomic and proteomic compositions, all six phicbk-like phages presented here are likely to use the same host adsorption mechanism. the phicbk head filament measures ~ <dig> nm in length and is highly flexible, but nothing is otherwise known about its structural conformation or mechanism of association with the flagellum . in addition to the head filament, phage phicbk has been observed to possess a single ~ <dig> nm tail fiber that extends from the distal end of the phage tail  <cit>  and is presumably involved in adsorption of the tail tip to the cell surface. the identity of the head filament and tail fiber proteins in phicbk is of significant interest as this mechanism of phage attachment appears to be unique in phage biology.

aside from the major tail tube subunit and the tape measure protein, three putative tail proteins were found to be associated with the phicbk virion: gp <dig> , gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  seen in figure  <dig> as bands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the genes encoding these proteins are in close proximity to other tail structural protein genes, the tail tube gene  <dig> and tail tape measure gene  <dig>  gp <dig> exhibits weak similarity to a putative tail fiber found in burkholderia phage bcepnazgul . while gp <dig> does not possess the conserved fibritin domain of the bcepnazgul protein, it does contain a pair of apparent ligand-binding domains , one of which is c-terminal, which may be involved in receptor binding. the band  <dig> protein gp <dig> contains an immunoglobulin-like  domain  and a phage tail-like domain , and is weakly related  to the rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent orf  <dig> , which is believed to be responsible for host specificity  <cit> . the n-proximal position of the gp <dig> ig-like domain is not likely to play a role in receptor binding, as phage tail fibers typically have their receptor-binding domains in their c-termini. the phage tail-like domain is located in the central portion of gp <dig>  although the function of this domain is unknown. the coliphage lambda tail fiber protein j also contains this pfam tail fiber domain, but this region of the protein is outside of the c-terminal receptor-recognition domain  <cit>  and thus may contribute to tail fiber structure rather than binding specificity. finally, phicbk gp <dig> contains three phage-associated conserved domains  of unknown function. a brief survey of other well-characterized phage tail fibers shows that such fibers yield approximately one nm of length per 12– <dig> amino acid residues . if phicbk gp <dig> formed tail fibers of this nature, the resulting fiber length should be on the order of 70– <dig> nm, while gp <dig> would form fibers of approximately 58– <dig> nm, and gp <dig> would form fibers of 27– <dig> nm. all of these lengths are in reasonable agreement with the size of the previously observed ~ <dig> nm tail fiber. the identity of this fiber cannot be conclusively assigned at this time; the size and conserved domains of gp <dig> and gp <dig> make them more probable candidates for this role.

phage phicbk and its relatives also encode a very large conserved protein which, while not detected as associated with the virion in this analysis, remains the most probable candidate for the head filament protein. in phicbk, gp <dig> is  <dig>  amino acids in length and contains a concanavalin a-like lectin domain  in its central region. gene  <dig> is located in the phage structural module, and is located closer to genes involved in head morphogenesis than to those associated with the phage tail . while this protein is conserved within all six of the phicbk-like phages, it does not have any similarity to other known proteins detectable by blastp. the protein is also highly enriched in glycine , alanine , and proline , with glycine repeat domains  in the n-terminal and central domains of the protein. the high glycine content of gp <dig> would be expected to result in a highly flexible structure, and analysis by psipred  <cit>  suggests the protein predominantly assumes random coil or beta strand conformation. thus, gp <dig> fulfills the major criteria expected of the phicbk head filament in terms of its size, flexibility, domain architecture and genomic location. analysis of phicbk  <dig> at the dna level suggests that this gene has undergone expansion by tandem duplications in its n-terminal half. the high molecular weight bands above band  <dig> in figure  <dig> did not return any peptide matches following ms analysis, and digestion of entire freeze-thawed virions followed by lc-ms also did not yield any peptide matches additional to those already described . the head filament protein may not have been directly detected in the proteomic analysis due to the fact that it is relatively fragile and could have been lost during the purification procedure .

phage lysis proteins
in many phage types, the lysis genes are clustered in a "lysis cassette". for phages of gram-negative hosts, the typical cassette consists of genes for the holin, the endolysin and the spanin subunits, responsible for permeabilization or destruction of the cytoplasmic membrane, the peptidoglycan, and the outer membrane, respectively. of these three classes of genes, the endolysin and the spanins can be identified with the most confidence, because endolysins have a variety of easily identified catalytic motifs, and spanins have unique primary and secondary structure features. using these considerations, the lysis cassettes were identified in all six phicbk-like phages. the phicbk cassette consists of genes  <dig> through  <dig> , encoding the predicted endolysin, holin and spanin proteins, respectively; this order is conserved in phages karma, magneto, swift and rogue. in colossus, the predicted holin gene has been transposed to a position following the spanin genes, resulting in the gene order endolysin-spanin-holin, encoded by genes  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively . no such inversion of gene order has been detected before in phages of the same type, although among phages of the t <dig> phage-type the endolysin gene is in some cases transposed to an early gene transcriptional unit.

the endolysin proteins
all six phicbk-like genomes have two proteins with catalytic motifs that are common in endolysins: the tail tape measure protein , with a chap endopeptidase domain ; and phicbk gp <dig>  which has a glycoside hydrolase domain . the presence of a chap domain in the tape measure protein is not unusual and is consistent with proposed mechanisms in which this protein is involved in penetrating the peptidoglycan after being ejected from the phage tail  <cit> . phicbk gp <dig>  is clearly the endolysin, since it has a strongly conserved glycoside hydrolase domain and has extensive homology to many phage proteins annotated as endolysins. however, only two coliphage homologs, p <dig> lyz and r <dig>  have been subjected to biochemical and structural analysis. both are sar endolysins carrying export signals at their n-termini  <cit> , a feature not shared by the phicbk-like endolysins. both r <dig> and p <dig> lyz belong to the canonical t <dig> lysozyme family, enzymes that have a characteristic n-terminal glu-8x-cys/asp-5x-thr catalytic triad. a comparison of the n-terminal domains of these endolysins  suggests that the phicbk-like proteins represent novel variants of the canonical lysozyme catalytic triad. while all have retained the cys/asp and thr residues with the standard spacing, in phicbk and its close relatives magneto, karma, swift and rogue, four nearby acidic residues are available to play the role of the catalytic glu common to all t4-related enzymes. the simplest notion that e <dig> is the catalytic glu, with the spacing between the catalytic glu and cys residues increased to  <dig> residues by the insertion of an intervening gly-pro rich loop. in colossus gp <dig>  the normal spacing would be retained but the catalytic asp/cys would be replaced by another glu residue. in p <dig> lyz, the presence of the cys residue in the catalytic triad is critical to the regulation of the enzyme because it is occupied in a disulfide bond until the enzyme is activated  <cit> . however, phicbk gp <dig> lacks a sar domain and is thus a soluble endolysin, dependent on the holin for release to the periplasm. it does have two other cys residues, cys <dig> and cys  <dig>  but neither is conserved in colossus, making disulfide bond regulation unlikely. thus phicbk gp <dig> may have evolved from a p <dig> lyz-like sar endolysin, consistent with our previous proposal that sar endolysins might constitute the most primitive form of regulated phage lysis, predating the appearance of holins in phage genomes  <cit> .

the spanin subunits
by far the most common spanin genes are those that encode two-component spanins  <cit> . each two component spanin locus encodes an integral inner membrane protein , and an outer membrane lipoprotein ; these are the functional equivalents of the lambda rz and rz <dig> proteins, respectively. genetic, biochemical and ultrastructural analyses have shown that the two proteins interact by virtue of their c-terminal domains to form the spanin complex, thus spanning the entire periplasm  <cit> . during lysis, after the endolysin has degraded the peptidoglycan, the rz-rz <dig> complexes are thought to oligomerize laterally to form coiled-coil bundles, which somehow leads to om disruption  <cit> . there are three known two-component spanin gene architectures: embedded, in which the gene encoding the om spanin component is entirely contained within the im component gene in the + <dig> reading frame ; overlapped, where the om gene also starts within the gene encoding the im component in the + <dig> frame but extends beyond it ; and separated, where the coding regions do not overlap at all  <cit> . the phicbk-like spanins  are remarkably similar in their architecture to lysb and lysc found in the classical coliphage p <dig>  as shown in figure 9a, both gene pairs belong to the overlapped spanin class. although the colossus spanin proteins are significantly diverged from those of the other phicbk-like phages , and these bear no sequence similarity to the spanins of phage p <dig>  the periplasmic domains of all of these im spanins both have similar predicted alpha helical character with proline-rich c-terminal domains, unlike lambda rz . one striking feature of the phicbk-like im spanins is the presence of a large n-terminal hydrophobic domain preceding the anchoring tmd, which strongly suggests the presence at least one and possibly two additional tmds. the n-terminal tmd of the im subunit of lambda rz can be substituted by heterologous tmds and is thus thought to be purely a membrane tether  <cit> . the extra membrane component in the phicbk-like im spanins would be unnecessary for simple membrane tethering and thus may reflect an additional function in lysis, perhaps in coordinating the function of the spanin complex with the function of the holin, which is an im protein in all phages. similarly, the periplasmic domains of the phicbk-like and p <dig> om spanins are remarkably parallel in primary structural features, with an n-terminal domain that is very enriched in proline residues and a c-terminal segment predicted to be alpha-helical but containing a single distal proline . little genetic analysis has been done with any spanin so it is unclear which of these features are important for function. however, missense changes in the first two proline residues in lysc have been shown to cause a premature lysis phenotype in cells with compromised peptidoglycan  <cit> . to date, these lysc alleles are unique in being the only alleles outside of holin and antiholin genes that have early lysis phenotypes, perhaps another hint that p2-like spanins may interact functionally with their cognate holins.

the holin proteins
unless there is sequence similarity with one of the very few holins that have been experimentally verified, it is difficult to identify holins with the same degree of confidence available for endolysins and spanins. however, most of the experimentally tested holins have multiple tmds and are encoded by genes clustered within a lysis cassette; phicbk gene  <dig>  fits these criteria  and is thus predicted to be the holin gene. experimentally confirmed holins have been identified in three different membrane topologies: class i ; class ii ; and class iii   <cit> . the first tmd of phicbk gp <dig> is unambiguous, between leu <dig> and phe <dig>  and the charge distribution flanking this tmd would put asp <dig> at the periplasmic interface, so tmd <dig> is n-in, c-out. beyond this, however, phicbk-like holin topology becomes ambiguous. commonly used algorithms like tmhmm and tmpred predict these holins to have only two tmds, the second of which would be over  <dig> residues in length . an alternative perspective is that this region encodes three tmds, taking advantage of the fact that lys residues, like lys <dig>  can “snorkel” and thus be mapped up to three residues inside the bilayer. this would give the phicbk-like holins a novel topology, with three tmds and an n-in, c-out orientation . in support of this notion, the c-terminal domain beyond the ambiguous hydrophobic region is strongly acidic, unlike class i and class ii holins, which both feature positively charged c-terminal cytoplasmic domains and consistent with the positive-inside, negative-outside theorem that dominates prokaryotic tmd topology  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that absent experimental confirmation, the identity of  <dig> as the holin is speculative. especially in view of the extra tmds present in the im spanin subunit of phicbk, it is worth noting that genes implicated in antiholin function have been identified in other phages, with gene products having a different variety of topologies.

phicbk-like gcra homolog
c. crescentus exhibits a peculiar dimorphic lifestyle, in which the stalked cell form divides asymmetrically to produce a flagellated “swarmer” cell. the swarmer cells are not capable of dna replication nor division until they undergo the transition to the stalked morphotype . transformation of cell shape, chromosomal replication and cell division are tightly regulated in c. crescentus by a cascade of master regulatory proteins including dnaa  <cit> , ctra  <cit>  and gcra  <cit> , and by the methylation state of the chromosome as mediated by ccrm  <cit> . under normal conditions, gcra is present in stalked cells undergoing dna replication and division, and is not detectable in swarmer cells where ctra is dominant  <cit> . ctra binds to the gcra transcriptional start site, negatively regulating its expression during the swarmer phase  <cit> . when expressed during early stages of dna replication and cell division, gcra up-regulates transcription of  <dig> c. crescentus genes, including several components of the cell’s dna replication machinery such as a dna gyrase, topoisomerase iv and a dna pol iii epsilon subunit  <cit> .

the tropism of phage phicbk for the swarmer cell type means that phicbk and its relatives predominantly infect cells in which dna replication is halted and gcra is downregulated. it is significant, therefore, that all of the phicbk-like phages with the exception of colossus encode a protein with homology to the c. crescentus gcra cell cycle regulator; in phage phicbk this protein is gp <dig>  the gcra homologs encoded by phages phicbk, magneto, swift and karma are identical and the rogue-encoded homolog is slightly diverged, a reflection of the overall relationship of these phages. forty-one amino acid residues are conserved across all phage-encoded proteins and the c. crescentus cb <dig> gcra homolog, and an additional  <dig> residues are similar. furthermore, all of the phage-encoded homologs are detectable as members of the gcra protein family . if the phage-encoded gcra homolog possesses the same functionality as its c. crescentus counterpart, the expression of phicbk gp <dig> in the infected swarmer cell may function to up-regulate expression of the c. crescentus dna replication apparatus, components of which may be required for the successful replication of the phicbk chromosome. gcra is rapidly degraded in swarmer cells  <cit> , therefore it also might be expected that the phage-encoded gcra homologs are able to resist this degradation.

possible translational modulators in phage colossus
while phage colossus lacks the gcra-like proteins found in the other phicbk-like phages, it possesses a number of additional genes, not found in the other phages, that may serve to modulate the host cell to the phage’s advantage. for example, colossus gp <dig> appears to be a truncated form of ribosomal elongation factor ts , with a predicted ef-ts domain . ef-ts catalyzes the cycling of gdp to gtp in elongation factor tu  by binding to the ef-tu·gdp complex and accelerating both the release of gdp and the association of gtp. expression of a phage-encoded ef-ts-like protein during infection could theoretically benefit the phage by increasing the available charged ef-tu pool and accelerating translation. while colossus gp <dig> is only  <dig> amino acids long, approximately one-third the length of known ef-ts proteins, it contains the n-proximal ef-ts subdomain n with its conserved f <dig> residue  that plays a major role in gdp nucleotide release from ef-tu  <cit> . however, gp <dig> seems to lack the c-proximal dimerization domain and other residues that are required for the interaction of ef-ts with ef-tu in other proteins, thus it is not clear if gp <dig> possesses full ef-ts-like functionality.

colossus also contains a possible ribosomal rna methyltransferase protein, gp <dig>  this protein possesses a rsmd-like rrna methyltransferase domain  and hhpred searches detect similarity to a number of methyltransferase families with roughly equal probability, including type i restriction-like dna methyltransferases  and rrna methyltransferases . methylated rrna bases tend to be clustered around active sites of the mature ribosome  <cit> , although their function is not entirely clear as absence of methylation at these sites typically yields a mild phenotype  <cit> . modification of the bacterial ribosome by a phage-encoded rrna methyltransferase may provide a fitness advantage to the phage, although the function of gp <dig> remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
the phicbk-like phages described here constitute a novel phage type and are distinguished by large genomes of  <dig> –  <dig> kb and prolate siphophage morphology. they all possess a t7-like dna polymerase, suggesting that they employ a t7-like dna replication strategy; this is the first case to our knowledge of a t7-like dna polymerase found outside of phages of the t <dig> superfamily. the structural proteome of phicbk identified the major phage structural components and several minor tail proteins of currently unknown function, although at least one of these is likely to be the tail fiber protein. the head filament protein was not conclusively established in the phicbk virion but a strong candidate protein for this role, gp <dig> in phicbk, was identified by bioinformatic analysis. these phages were found to contain several proteins that may allow the phage to more efficiently utilize cellular resources, including homologs of the gcra cell cycle regulator and proteins that may interact with the cellular translational apparatus. the phages were sequenced by  <dig> pyrosequencing to coverages of  <dig> to 291-fold depth. these coverages were sufficient to identify coverage breakpoints that represented the boundaries of non-permuted terminal repeats in these genomes. the terminal ligation method developed here confirmed these boundaries in phage phicbk. these methods will allow for greater throughput in the identification of phage genomic termini in the future.
