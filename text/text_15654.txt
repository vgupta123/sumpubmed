BACKGROUND
single base changes in protein coding regions of dna which lead to changes in amino acids have the potential to effect protein structure and function. these non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been the subject of many recent studies and a large amount of data now exists in public repositories such as dbsnp  <cit> , hgvbase  <cit>  and swissprot  <cit> . some nssnps are related to a disease condition but others are not associated with any change in phenotype and are regarded as neutral. several studies have attempted to predict the functional consequences of a nssnp, namely whether it is disease related or neutral, based on attributes of the polymorphism. some attributes depend only on the sequence information, for example the types of residue found at the snp location. structural attributes such as solvent accessibility can be chosen if the protein sequence containing the nssnp has a known 3d structure or is highly similar to a protein sequence of known structure. as structural genomics projects gain momentum an increasingly large amount of protein 3d structural information is becoming available. mapping nssnps onto the corresponding 3d structures or onto the structures of proteins which are highly similar at the sequence level immediately gives a structural context to the snp and there are databases containing such models  <cit> . previous studies have sought to identify rules by which a nssnp could be predicted to be deleterious  or neutral. these have included the development of empirical rules  <cit> , the use of probabalistic methods  <cit>  and machine learning  <cit> . the datasets used have included data on known nssnps  and mutation data of bacteriophage t <dig> lysozyme and e coli lac repressor . databases of coding nssnps have been developed by karchin et al  <cit> , cavallo and martin  <cit> . some of the rules that have emerged from these approaches suggest that the majority of disease associated nssnps affect protein stability  <cit> , that they are located in surface pockets of protein structures  <cit>  and that conservation of the residue across species is an important predictive attribute  <cit> . recently bao and cui  <cit>  using a large collection of nssnps from swissprot observed that structural information is useful when little information can be obtained from homologous sequences.

in this study we considered all nssnps described in the swissprot variant web pages that could be mapped onto the ensembl database  <cit> , allowing us to apply ensembl annotations to these variants. this gave a set of  <dig>  nssnps  of which  <dig>  were associated with disease.  <dig> were labelled as being neutral and  <dig> were unclassified. these disease and neutral nssnps were contained within  <dig> and  <dig> proteins respectively.

we surveyed the association of a number of sequence and structural attributes of nssnps to see if previous trends of disease and neutrality are preserved in light of the much larger datasets now available and we also included the attribute of whether the nssnp occurs in a protein binding site  <cit> .

one of the problems with using the available collection of natural nssnps is the large difference in the number of disease associated and neutral examples. to address this problem of class imbalance we also assessed the effect of resampling and weighting on the prediction performance.

RESULTS
distribution of attributes across the normal and disease associated nssnps
non structural features
our dataset contains  <dig>  disease associated nssnps and  <dig> nssnps labelled as polymorphisms. the distribution of sequence derived attributes suggests: tryptophan , tyrosine  and cysteine  in the wild and mutated residues increases the chance of the nssnp being disease related. this has previously been noted for tryptophan and cysteine by vitkup et al.  <cit> . the likelihood of the nssnp being deleterious increases as the volume, mass and hydrophobicity difference between the wild and mutated residue increases. there appeared to be very little bias in the physicochemical properties individually towards the status of the nssnp. as previously observed, a nssnp is much more likely to be deleterious with increasing psic  <cit>  conservation score difference  <cit> .

swissprot features table
in table  <dig> we show the most discriminatory terms from the swissprot features table, namely those where over 90% of the corresponding nssnps are disease related. the annotation of a nssnp in the swissprot feature table is not a good discriminator between disease and polymorphic status. in our dataset those feature table terms which are predominantly associated with disease related nssnps have very low counts making it difficult to generalize about their utility in predicting whether a given nssnp is disease related.

kegg pathways
our analysis of nssnps that map to kegg pathways  <cit>  revealed that the odds ratio  of deleterious to polymorphism nssnps  is highest for the following  <dig> pathways: phenylalanine, ty-rosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, methionine metabolism, carbon fixation , nucleotide sugars metabolism . assignment to a kegg map was not used as an attribute for machine learning prediction as this result may simply reflect that these are commonly studied pathways and the pathway was considered to be a property of the protein as opposed to the nssnp.

gene ontology
the odds ratio is highest for the following go  <cit>  biological processes: anti-inflammatory response , peroxisome organization and biogenesis , and peroxisomal membrane transport . the go cell location categories having the highest odds ratio are peroxisomal membrane , integral to peroxisomal membrane  and collagen type vii  categories. the molecular function categories containing the highest odds ratio are phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase activity, alpha-galactosidase activity  and pyruvate kinase activity . go categories were not used as machine learning attributes as they were considered to be properties of the protein as opposed to the nssnp.

interactions
a total of  <dig> swissprot nssnps mapped to proteins that have entries in bind  <cit> . a significant number of disease nssnps are within interacting regions  within bind. table  <dig> shows  <dig> %  of positions containing one or more nssnps that map to interacting regions are associated with disease  as opposed to  <dig> %  which contain polymorphism nssnps.

structural features
a total of  <dig> nssnps could be mapped to a homologous protein of known structure. we found that of the nssnps that could be mapped to structure, disease nssnps tend to be buried and neutral nssnps tend to be exposed. there is also a propensity towards disease for nssnps occurring in beta sheets as previously noted  <cit>  and a trend towards neutrality with increased accessibility.

interactions
a total of  <dig> swissprot nssnps mapped to proteins that have structures or structural homologs in mmdbbind  <cit> . table  <dig> shows 86%  of positions containing one or more nssnps that map to interacting residues are associated with disease  but also that 82%  of positions containing one or more nssnps that map to non-interacting residues are associated with disease. the difference between interacting sites containing disease nssnps and non-interacting sites containing disease nssnps is not significant .

all attributes excluding the kegg pathway and go attributes were used in further machine learning analysis.

machine learning
single attribute analysis
the 1r algorithm identified the best single attribute in terms of predicting disease status  <cit> . the attributes were ranked in terms of effectiveness as a predictor and were also ranked in terms of the information gain that they provide . the psic conservation score was identified as the best classifier in a balanced dataset achieving 72% correctly classified instances with the rules that defined a nssnp as being disease status with a conservation score difference >  <dig>  and neutral with a conservation score difference < =  <dig> . these classifiers compared favourably with the conservation score rules identified by sunyaev et al in their study  <cit>  whereby a psic score difference < =  <dig>  was classified as benign,  <dig>  to  <dig>  possibly damaging and > =  <dig>  probably damaging.

attribute set analysis
the j <dig> decision tree algorithm  <cit>  was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the following subsets of attributes: all variables. structural variables. non structurally dependant variables. non structurally dependant variables excluding the conservation score . conservation score alone.

effect of imbalance
attribute sets  and  contained  <dig> nssnps when imbalanced and  <dig> when balanced . both sets included structural variables. datasets ,  and  contained  <dig>  nssnps when imbalanced and  <dig> when balanced. they contained more nssnps than sets  and  because they were not dependant on structure.

the matthews correlation coeffecient  increased with increasing balance within each of the sets of attributes. there was a difference in the mcc score between 0% balanced and 100% balanced of  <dig>  for dataset ,  <dig>  for ,  <dig>  for ,  <dig>  for  and  <dig>  for . the performance of the weighted sets lay between the level of 25% and 50% balancing for each attribute set .

the 100% balanced dataset  achieved a mcc of  <dig> . when weighted and imbalanced the mcc was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for this same set. the balanced dataset  was equal second in the rankings with 75% balanced , performing better than dataset . the conservation score alone achieved a similar mcc score when considered separately  as it did when it was included in dataset   when 100% balanced. when the conservation score is excluded there is a drop of  <dig>  in the mcc of the 100% balanced dataset . when set  is balanced it performs better than  but when it is not 100% balanced it has a lower mcc. dataset  actually performs better than the dataset  when the datasets are < = 50% balanced or weighted. the imbalanced dataset  achieved the lowest mcc score.

the rules learnt from the machine learning approach were applied to make predictions on nssnps where the nssnp status was unknown. all nssnps within ensembl  were used as the unknown test dataset. the dataset was trained on the 100% balanced dataset of  <dig> neutral and  <dig> disease nssnps using all variables. this resulted in a predicted classification along with a confidence score for each of the 'unseen' nssnps with ensembl.

discussion
the use of a 100% balanced dataset dramatically increases the matthews correlation coefficient  and removes any bias towards building rules for prediction of the disease state. complete undersampling is a better choice than reweighting in addressing an imbalanced dataset. when imbalanced, performance using conservation alone  is close to that achieved by bao and cui  <cit>   yet with a balanced dataset the mcc is greatly improved .

we see a larger spread in the mcc when using the smaller datasets that include structural variables because of the larger ratio of disease to neutral nssnps in these datasets. this explains why the performance for the dataset of all variables  is good when >50% balanced, yet drops below that of non structurally dependant variables when the level of balance falls below this figure. it also explains the similar pattern seen when comparing structurally dependant variables and non structurally dependant variables excluding conservation, except that the cut off lies at the 75% level of balance.

there are a number of caveats with the training dataset. the dataset may include nssnps predicted to be 'disease' where some of the nssnps may only be in linkage disequilibrium with the phenotype in question and may themselves not be causative. this 'pollutes' the training set and may lead to a higher error rate and lower mcc. further filtering of the dataset would lead to a smaller but cleaner training set that would in turn lead to lower error rates and an increase in the mcc. further complications could arise where molecular phenotypic changes that don't result in a physical phenotype and unstudied or unobserved phenotypic changes may result in a nssnp being classified as neutral that should be classified as disease. improvements to the system could also be made if snps could be graded in terms of how damaging they are as opposed to the boolean states of disease and polymorphism that currently classifies them. in time databases may contain this information.

CONCLUSIONS
reassuringly, previously observed trends can be seen in this study of a large number of nssnps. disease nssnps tend to affect protein stability  <cit> , are buried  <cit>  and disruption of a conserved residue is an important predictive attribute  <cit> . we extend previous work by addressing the problems of imbalance and redundancy within the attributes for a large selection of natural nssnps and then go on to make predictions on all ensembl nssnps. bao and cui  <cit>  and saunders and baker  <cit>  showed that in the absence of a conservation score, structural attributes are valuable predictors. here we affirm using machine learning methods that the sequence conservation measure is the most powerful single predictor and we are able to show that a high level of accuracy is achieved using the conservation score alone. we are also able to show that structural attributes in combination with the conservation score improves prediction accuracy but also that there are other non structurally dependant attributes that can reduce the error rate further and are valuable in the absence of a conservation score. the performance of all attribute subsets however, is very much dependant on how the datasets are configured. the maximum prediction accuracy can be achieved by combining all attributes of the nssnp within a balanced dataset.
