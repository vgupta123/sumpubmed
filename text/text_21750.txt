BACKGROUND
protein-protein interaction networks  derived from high-throughput studies are known to have many errors  <cit> . data from different studies usually exhibit low overlap; for instance, two large-scale human interactome screens  <cit>  share only six interactions, while each has several thousand interactions  <cit> . in some ppins, more than 50% of reported interactions are estimated to be false positives  or wrong interactions  <cit> . moreover, current ppins are incomplete with an estimated false negative  rate approaching 90%  <cit> . false positives often result when the matrix model, which fully connects the pray and bait proteins, is used for interpreting results of affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry experiments  <cit> .

not all interactions occur at the same place and time in all cellular states. this implies that representing a ppin as a set of binary protein-protein interactions  is often incomplete  <cit> . instead, one wants to restructure protein complexes in ppins, which are modular units of physical interactions occurring at the same time and cellular component  <cit> . for predicting complexes one wants to include complementary data, such as structural domain-domain interactions  representing binding evidence on proteins  <cit> . at the same time, one wants to leave out of predicted complexes the false positives  <cit> .

it was proposed that triangle network motifs represent the basic building blocks of ppins  <cit> . in this paper, we complement ppis with sddis to form ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs. triangle network motifs integrate high-throughput ppins with complementary knowledge, such as structural data, to account for missing edges  <cit> . our proposed paradigm of ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs integrate:

• ppins from high-throughput experimental studies, which have considerable coverage but also errors, and

• sddis that are known to physically mediate ppis and may be missing in ppins  <cit> .

a theme encompasses several ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs with one sddi edge as their common organizational principle. figure 1a shows a theme consisting of three ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs that share one common sddi. to demonstrate the biological relevance of triangle network motifs and themes, figures 1b,c show myosin-actin functions in different cellular locations: cytoskeleton organization and nuclear transcription.

the purpose of ppi-sddi-ppi triangles is to support revealing biological insights, such as finding complexes of physical interactions occurring at the same time and location  <cit> . besides complementing ppins with sddis, we additionally form triangle network motifs with other complementary datatypes , such as threading results, and pubmed protein co-occurrence data, thus expanding to other ppi-cd-ppi triangles  <cit> . the complex prediction with other cd is comparable to sddis; this supports that the improved complex prediction results are due to a physical relation between proteins and not just coincidence  <cit> .

a rationale for triangles and themes is the observation that proteins with common interaction partners are likely to have common functions  <cit> . second-level neighbors in ppins are functionally similar, and are useful for functional prediction  <cit> . by this "guilt by association of common interaction partners" approach, themes can be tied to specific biological phenomena and processes  <cit> . for instance, it was shown for the e. coli and c. elegans transcriptional network that subgraphs matching two types of transcriptional regulatory circuit triangle – feed-forward and bi-fan – overlap with one another and form large clusters  <cit> . another rationale for triangles and themes is that ppins are "small-world" implying neighborhood clustering, where neighbors of a given node tend to interact with one another; this results in triangle network motifs of three-node interconnection patterns  <cit> . this led to the "transitive module" hypothesis that is used for predicting missing interactions, as shown in figure 1a, where proteins with many common interaction partners are likely to interact with one another forming triangles  <cit> .

extracting triangle network motifs and themes from high-throughput interaction networks
this paper is organized as follows. next, we present related work on finding errors in ppins via motifs of interconnection patterns. then, we present the results on prediction of true positive complexes using triangles. we illustrate this with an example of myosin-actin related activities. next, we explain the biological basis for triangles: a model for sddis that explains the functional similarity of second-level neighbors in ppins. finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook of using other data sources to complement interactomes.

related work
several papers aim to find errors in ppins by completing them for missing edges or finding false positives  <cit> . our approach differs from all of these approaches, since we integrate structural information with ppins derived from high-throughput studies to find triangle network motifs and themes, which can be used to predict complexes. moreover, we offer the biological basis for the ability of this structural-ppi hybrid method to predict complexes.

a first category of work involves collecting ensembles of data, such as structural or literature information. alber et al.   <cit>  collect diverse high-quality data, and analyse the ensemble to produce a detailed architectural map of the nuclear pore complex. this work translates the data into spatial restraints, instead of using network motifs as in our approach. ramirez et al.   <cit>  assessed the quality and value of publicly available human protein network data, by comparing predicted datasets, high-throughput results from yeast two-hybrid screens, and literature-curated protein-protein interactions. this analysis revealed major differences between datasets. rhodes et al.   <cit>  demonstrate that a probabilistic analysis integrating model organism protein interactome data, structural domain data, genome-wide gene expression data and functional annotation data predicts nearly  <dig>  interactions in humans. bader et al.   <cit>  perform an integrated analysis of proteomics data with data from genetics and gene expression. combining temporal gene expression clustering with proteomics network topology provides an automated method for extracting biological subnetworks. huang et al.   <cit>  present point, the "prediction of interactome database". point integrates several publicly accessible databases, with emphasis placed on mouse, fruit fly, worm and yeast protein-protein interactions datasets from the database of interacting proteins , followed by converting them into a predicted human interactome. point also incorporates correlated mrna expression clusters obtained from cell cycle microarray databases and subcellular localization from gene ontology to pinpoint the likelihood of biological relevance of each predicted set of interacting proteins. patil et al.   <cit>  find that a combination of sequence, structure and annotation information is a good predictor of true interactions in large and noisy interactomes.

another large body of work attempted to predict the missing interactions or assign confidences to large noisy interactomes. some of these use network topology and others use information on sddis, while others use bayesian networks or probabilistic measures. yu et al.   <cit>  describe predicting missing ppis, using only the ppin topology as observed by a high-throughput experiment. the method searches the interactome for defective cliques, nearly complete complexes of pairwise interacting proteins, and predicts the interactions that complete them. chen et al.   <cit>  propose using triplets of observed ppis to predict and validate interactions. yeast is the only data set large enough to warrant application of this method. singhal et al.   <cit>  present domainga, a computational approach that uses information about sddis to predict ppis. this method achieves good prediction for the positive and negative ppis in yeast. pitre et al.   <cit>  present pipe, a system for predicting ppis for any target pair of the yeast proteins from their primary structure. chen et al.   <cit>  introduce a novel measure called irap, "interaction reliability by alternative path", for assessing the reliability of ppis based on the underlying ppin topology. irap measure is effective for discovering reliable ppis in large noisy ppin datasets. ng et al.   <cit>  propose an integrative approach that applies sddis to predict and validate ppis. chen et al.   <cit>  introduce a sddi-based random forest of decision trees to infer ppis. this method is capable of exploring all possible sddis and making predictions based on all the protein domains. wu et al.   <cit>  propose using the similarity between two gene ontology  terms for reconstructing and predicting a yeast ppin based solely on knowledge of functional associations between the go annotations.

we have also experimented with using go similarities in our approach. chinnasamy et al.   <cit>  present a probabilistic-based naive bayesian network to predict ppis using protein sequence information. this framework provides a confidence level for every predicted ppi. jansen et al.   <cit>  also developed an approach using bayesian networks to predict ppis in yeast. han et al.   <cit>  propose prespi, a domain combination based ppi prediction approach. ppis are interpreted as the result of groups of multiple sddis. this approach also provides an interacting probability for ppis. recently, vidal and colleagues  <cit>  used reference sets to calculate the probability that a newly identified ppi is a true biophysical interaction, and assigned confidence scores to all ppis in interactome networks. yu et al.   <cit>  assign confidence scores that reflect the reliability of each ppi, by using multiple independent sets of training positives to reduce the bias inherent in using a single training set.

another body of work has performed large scale analysis of networks, statistical network motif analysis or error estimation, which is of interest for our work as well. jin et al.   <cit>  use network motifs to solve the open question about 'party hubs' and 'date hubs' which was raised by previous studies. at the level of network motifs instead of individual proteins, they found two types of hubs, motif party hubs and motif date hubs, whose network motifs display distinct characteristics on biological functions. zhang et al.   <cit>  observed that different types of networks exhibit different triangle profiles, providing a means for network classification. they extended the network triangle concept to an integrated network of many interaction types. mathivanan et al.   <cit>  analyzed the major publically available databases that contain literature curated ppi information for human proteins, finding a large difference in their content. this included bind, dip, hprd, intact, mint, mips, pdzbase and reactome databases  <cit> . chiang et al.   <cit>  assess the error statistics in all published large-scale datasets for s. cerevisiae. vidal and colleagues  <cit>  used an empirically-based approach to assess the quality and coverage of existing human interactomes. they found that high-throughput human interactomes are more precise than literature-curated ppis from publications.

several papers used clustering or graph theoretic methods to predict complexes in ppins. bader et al.  detected complexes as highly connected subgraphs  <cit> . andreopoulos et al.  detected complexes as groups of proteins with similar interaction partners  <cit> . cakmak et al.   <cit>  go beyond complexes to discover unknown pathways in organisms, using gene ontology -based functionalities of enzymes involved in metabolic pathways.

RESULTS
in our experiments, we employ three high-throughput ppins, derived by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry . krogan <dig> is based on  <cit> . gavin06matrix and gavin06spoke are matrix and spoke model interpretations, respectively, of  <cit> . the matrix model of interpreting pull-down studies connects all prey proteins that were pulled out with a bait, while the spoke model connects only the preys with the bait. we focus on yeast ppins, since yeast is a well-annotated organism with gene ontology terms. the krogan <dig> and gavin06spoke yeast ppins have low overlap. to evaluate the success of our approach, we employ known complexes from the mips database  <cit> . we evaluate whether known mips complexes could be predicted using triangles and theme motifs, consisting of ppins combined with complementary data such as sddis. for illustratory purposes, we use three manually curated networks of myosin-actin involvement in different cellular processes 

low overlaps of ppins with complexes
the biological motivation for our work includes low overlap of high-throughput ppins with known complexes. we compared the overlaps of two high-throughput ppins, the gavin06matrix and krogan <dig> networks, with the mips protein complexes dataset. table  <dig> shows full results for the overlaps of gavin06matrix and krogan <dig> networks to the mips complexes. for protein pairs that appear in both ppins and complexes, we evaluated the number of overlapping edges ppin ∩ complexes. we found gavin <dig> ∩ mips has  <dig> overlapping edges, krogan <dig> ∩ mips has  <dig> overlapping edges.

symbols below denote e, edges; |·|, set cardinality; ∩, intersection; -, set difference.

a |enetwork ∩ emips|

b |enetwork - emips|

only those edges were considered where both proteins were present in the ppi network and in mips.

gavin06matrix and krogan <dig> had thousands of edges connecting these same proteins, which were not in mips. figure  <dig> illustrates the overlaps of gavin06matrix and krogan <dig> to manually curated myosin-actin networks; the high-throughput ppins detected disconnected components and individual modules, but not the entire connected myosin-actin processes.

ppi-sddi-ppi triangles predict complexes
given the many false negatives  and false positives  in protein-protein interaction networks  derived from high-throughput experiments, we evaluated the success of triangle network motifs and themes in finding known mips complexes. with structural domain-domain interactions  representing binding evidence on proteins, ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs are likely to reflect true complexes. to evaluate this, we examined the overlap of triangles from gavin <dig> and krogan <dig> with mips complexes. for the common proteins we evaluated the interactions that are true positives  or false positives  with mips.

the first row of table  <dig> shows the low overlap between ppin second-level neighbors  and mips complexes; where all three proteins in an indirect relation occur in mips complexes , rarely both ppis occur . despite the observed functional similarity of second-level neighbors in ppins  <cit> , second-level neighbors have overlap with mips lower than 1%. the other rows show that integrating complementary datatypes  in a ppin to form ppi-cd-ppi triangle network motifs results in a higher overlap with mips complexes. in table  <dig> the second row shows the ppi-sddi-ppi triangle overlap with mips complexes as a true positive rate as high as 31%; the other triangle interactions are likely false positives. for gavin06matrix the triangle true positive rate is lower than for krogan <dig>  since gavin06matrix reflects the matrix model interpretation, which resulted in  <dig>   <dig> edges including many false positives. gavin06matrix has many errors when overlayed with the mips complex dataset. the success rate is higher for gavin06spoke, since there are fewer false positives than gavin06matrix.

fractions denote true positive ppis/all triangle ppis for triangles or second-level neighbors where all three proteins occur in mips complexes. triangle success in mips complex prediction is shown as the triangle edges that overlap with complexes. we consistently notice a lower success rate for gavin06matrix than gavin06spoke, which is explained by the higher number of errors in gavin06matrix.

fractions denote true positive ppis /all triangle ppis. in triangles where the complementary data  are sddi structural information or threading, scop domain families first need to be assigned to proteins based on confidence. the confidences for protein-scop domain assignments are derived, for structural sddis based on blast sequence alignment similarity, and for threading they are provided by the gtd threading database. considering different confidence thresholds for protein-scop domain assignments affects the mips complex prediction success rate.

triangles with other complementary data
we added to ppins other complementary datatypes, besides structural sddis, to form triangles: pubmed literature co-occurrences of protein mentions, and interpro pfam domain co-occurrences in ppis  <cit>  . table  <dig> rows 3– <dig> show the mips complex overlaps with triangle network motifs using other complementary datatypes to form triangles. the triangles with other complementary datatypes exhibit little difference in their overlap with mips complexes. in the last row  <dig> where all datatypes are combined, the overlap with mips increases. triangles that include sddis or other complementary data to match second-level neighbors have higher overlap with mips complexes than second-level neighbors without any complementary data. these results point to the direction of complementing the ppins with other datatypes as triangle network motifs, rather than simple edges, for improved prediction of mips complexes.

example: reconstructing distinct myosin-actin biopathways via themes of ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs
type i myosin motor proteins  have distinct but overlapping functions in multiple cellular processes and locations  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows examples of myosin involvements as ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs and themes derived from gavin06matrix  <cit> . figure 4a shows several core myosin-actin sddis that are common to different processes and locations. the sddis were validated with the structural interaction network given in  <cit> . for instance, myosin type i  has sddis with the arp2/ <dig> complex, which plays a major role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, but also plays a role in actin-filament formation during transcription in the nucleus  <cit> . figures 4b,c,d extend these core myosin-actin sddis with ppis that are specific to different processes and locations: cytoskeletal actin organization, nuclear transcription, and asymmetric mrna localization  <cit> .

myo <dig> is one of two type i myosins, which utilize the cytoskeleton for movement, moving along microfilaments through interaction with actin. deletion of myo <dig> causes severe defects in growth and actin cytoskeleton organization  <cit> . besides myosin, she <dig> is also important for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. she <dig> is of special interest because it is involved in all of organization of the actin cytoskeleton, asymmetric mrna localization, and endocytosis  <cit> . she <dig> has similar gene ontology annotations as myosin.

next, we explore whether triangle network motifs and themes in gavin06matrix can help reconstruct distinct myosin-actin pathways for cellular localization of biomolecules.

cytoskeletal actin organization
rsr <dig>  bni <dig>  gea <dig> play a role in cytoskeletal actin localization  <cit> . the correct localization of rsr <dig> has been shown to be critical for actin cytoskeleton organization. localization of the ras-like gtpase rsr <dig> and its regulators are required for selection of a specific growth site  <cit> . regulators direct the correct localization of rsr <dig> in various organisms. in figure 4b, while rsr <dig> interacts with both myo <dig> and gea <dig>  it also interacts with parts of their intersecting neighborhoods. both go term similarity and the literature suggest myo3/gea <dig> control of rsr <dig>  the gea <dig> ras superfamily g proteins  has observed sddis with both arf <dig> and rsr <dig>  gea <dig> is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for adp ribosylation factors , involved in vesicular transport between the golgi and er, golgi organization, and actin cytoskeleton organization; similar to but not functionally redundant with gea <dig>  an active sec <dig> region in gea <dig>  which is the probable catalytic domain for gef activity, is important for actin cytoskeleton activity. the mechanism by which gea <dig> and gea <dig> stimulate actin cable formation in a bni1-dependent manner remains to be determined  <cit> .

what is of special interest in this example is the intersection of the neighborhoods of rsr <dig>  arf <dig>  bni <dig> comprising ef1a-rl <dig>  which were previously observed to have a functional significance for f-actin localization  <cit> . in addition, bni <dig> and gea <dig> appear to be connected to the arf <dig> complex via pyr <dig> intermediary. thus, rsr <dig>  gea <dig> and bni <dig> appear to be linked to one another via ef1a-rl3-pyr <dig>  which are also common partners of arf <dig>  this suggests a role of ef1a-rl3-pyr <dig> as the regulators for the rsr1-gea1-bni <dig> complex localization in yeast cytoskeletal actin localization  <cit> .

overexpression of gea <dig> or gea <dig> was observed to bypass the requirement for profilin in actin cable formation  <cit> . profilin is an actin-binding protein involved in cytoskeleton dynamics. profilin enhances actin growth as follows: profilin binds to monomeric actin on the plus end of the filament inducing a shape change of the actin subunit, allowing the g-actin to replace the adp to which it is bound by atp and form f-actin. the f-actin then forms a heterodimer which can bind to the plus end of an actin filament. in the process of binding to the actin monomers it also stereochemically inhibits addition to the minus end  <cit> . on the other hand, in a separate study it was observed that loss of the activity to bind ef1a-rl <dig> displayed an abnormal phenotype represented by dissociated localizations of f-actin, which were co-localized in wild-type cells  <cit> . this observation links the two studies, suggesting that the significance of ef1a-rl <dig> for f-actin localization may help explain why overexpression of gea <dig> or gea <dig> bypassed the requirement for profilin in actin cable formation.

nuclear actin and myosin i required for rna polymerase i, ii, iii transcription
tba1/rap <dig> play a role in nucleus transciption from rna polymerase ii promoter. tba1/rap <dig> is a dna-binding protein involved in either activation or repression of transcription, depending on binding site context; it also binds telomere sequences and plays a role in telomeric position effect  and telomere structure. in figure 4c, rap <dig> is associated with myo3/she <dig>  which transport rap <dig> and actin in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. while rap <dig> has ppis to rsr <dig>  bni <dig> and arf <dig>  literature confirms this is an indirect relationship and instead that myosin type i translocates rap <dig> in both the nucleus and cytoplasm   <cit> . the indirect interaction of rap <dig> with rsr <dig>  bni <dig> and arf <dig> points to the involvement of actin in transciption.

mrna localization: the she protein complex is required for cytoplasmic transport of mrnas in yeast
arf <dig>  ef1a, imdh <dig> play a role in mrna localization for translation. arf <dig> is an adp-ribosylation factor involved in regulation of coated formation vesicles in intracellular trafficking within the golgi  <cit> . in figure 4d, arf <dig> is likely to interact with subsets of the main cluster; particularly we notice an association of arf <dig> with both ef1a and imdh3:

• ef1a: translation elongation factors are responsible for two main processes during protein synthesis on the ribosome  <cit> . ef1a  is responsible for the selection and binding of the cognate aminoacyl-trna to the a-site  of the ribosome. ef <dig>  is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-trna from the a-site to the p-site  of the ribosome, thereby freeing the a-site for the next aminoacyl-trna to bind. elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both ef1a and ef <dig> are remarkably conserved throughout evolution .

• imdh3: involved in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway.

biological interpretation of ppi-sddi-ppi triangles: a structural basis for functional similarity of second-level neighbors in ppins
in this section we propose an explanation for the observation that sddis can complement high-error ppins to improve the finding of complexes. a structural sddi between two proteins implies that they are likely to be observed with common groups of interaction partners in an experimental study. this especially holds in affinity purification experiments followed by mass spectrometry , since the bait-prey technologies used will cause structurally connected proteins to be detected as prey for similar bait protein. of course this only holds for proteins that are detectable as prey  <cit> . a sddi is the likely reason why two proteins are observed with common friends in ppins from high-throughput ap/ms studies. then, the sddi's interaction partners are likely to be observed in different cellular components; figure  <dig> shows that many of the sddi-induced triangles have no common gene ontology annotation. then sddis are a partial explanation for the functional similarity of second-level neighbors in ppins. we propose this couple-with-common-friends model as the biological basis for finding complexes via ppi-sddi-ppi triangle network motifs and themes; subsequently, sddi edges in triangles can be replaced by other complementary datatypes.

CONCLUSIONS
how many sddis are needed to predict all complexes for an entire ppin?
sddis and the pubmed co-occurrences relate to two different aspects. sddis are based on experimental results that are likely to imply a structural interaction. in the case of sddis, we can use all information found by mapping structural domains to proteins using blast sequence similarity and still get good prediction accuracy. on the other hand, for literature we have to apply a strict filtering, keeping only the top 1% of protein co-occurrences appearing in pubmed as complementary data. we observed that the literature co-occurrences appear to give slightly better results than using sddis as complementary data. the main limitation of sddis at present is the sparsity of known structural interactions. since pubmed is expected to grow faster than structural knowledge, using literature co-occurrences might give even better prediction accuracy in the future, as long as a strict cut-off is set.
