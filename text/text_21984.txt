BACKGROUND
pathogens have evolved many ingenious mechanisms to manipulate innate and adaptive host immune responses  <cit> . the nematode parasite brugia malayi is a causative agent of the disease lymphatic filariasis, which afflicts over  <dig> million people in tropical countries. mosquito-borne infective stage larvae gain entry to the human body during a blood meal, and establish long-lived infections characterised by down-regulation of host t cell and macrophage reactivity  <cit> . we have studied the profile of genes expressed in infective larvae and reported that ~5% of the mrna transcripts from this stage correspond to two closely related genes, which we have named abundant larval transcript  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . the two genes encode proteins with 79% amino acid identity, but no similarity to any gene of known function. alt-like genes are present in other filarial nematode species  <cit>  and are characterised by a signal peptide, a variable acidic domain, and a conserved, cysteine-rich domain. a distantly-related gene is also present in the genomes of the free-living nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and c. briggsae but in both cases the acidic domain is absent .

alt proteins are stockpiled in the oesophageal glands of infective larvae  <cit>  and are secreted by the parasites when they encounter mammalian culture conditions. thus, their function may be to promote parasite survival within the host physiological or immunological environment. for example, alts may interfere with the critical first interaction between the innate immune system and the nematode invaders. it has been established that larval stages rapidly elicit a strong th <dig> response in mice  <cit>  and induce host macrophages to adopt a counter-inflammatory phenotype  <cit> . although alt antigens are not expressed on the parasite surface, they can induce protective immunity in animal models  <cit> , indicating that neutralization of alt function may be sufficient to protect the host from infection.

transgenesis and targeted gene deletion have yet to be established for parasitic helminths, so it is not possible to investigate the biological role of alt proteins by conventional reverse genetics. we reasoned, however, that if alt function is fulfilled within the host rather than within the parasite, we can validly study these proteins by transgenic expression in a more tractable carrier species. we chose to test this approach with the protozoal parasite leishmania, several species of which are infective to laboratory mice. leishmania can readily be modified genetically  <cit>  to yield lines expressing high levels of exogenous transgenes. we selected l. mexicana as it establishes infections in murine macrophages in vitro, providing experimental access to a key cell type known to be modified in filarial infection  <cit> . l. mexicana will also infect mice, and although the immunological factors determining resistance and susceptibility are not as well-defined as in l. major  <cit> , it offers the advantage of slower in vivo kinetics and consequently is anticipated to be more sensitive to altering factors. using this model, we show here that transgenic l. mexicana expressing the alt proteins are more virulent in macrophages in vitro, and that this property is abolished by deletion of the filarial-specific acidic domain. we also show that mice infected with alt-transgenic l. mexicana harbour higher parasite burdens than controls. by studying the responses of macrophages infected with transgenic parasites, we suggest that the alt products modulate cytokine-induced signalling and render parasites more resistant to ifn-γ-induced killing.

RESULTS
expression of b. malayi alts in l. mexicana
bm-alt- <dig> and bm-alt- <dig> genes were subcloned in their entirety, including endogenous signal peptide sequences, into the recombination vector pssu, which contains flanking sequences homologous to the 18s small subunit  rrna locus  <cit>  . electroporation of l. mexicana was undertaken, permitting homologous recombination of the alt- <dig> and - <dig> sequences downstream of the strong polymerase i promoter into the sequence for the small sub-unit rrna, which is known to be transcribed in both stages of the life cycle of the parasite. following puromycin selection, multiple transgenic lines were isolated for each alt gene, from which representative clones were selected containing the correct insert at an appropriate integration site. transgenic alt expression in the free-living culture promastigote stage was confirmed in both lines by western blot  and immunofluorescent staining  of permeabilized parasites with murine anti-alt antibodies. not only were alt proteins found widely distributed in the transgenic protozoa, but staining of the membrane-rich flagella indicated surface expression in the promastigote stage. this was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of anti-alt-stained non-permeabilized transgenic promastigotes .

in vitro infection of macrophages with transfected amastigotes
bone-marrow-derived macrophages were infected with axenic transformed amastigotes of each line. both wild-type  and alt-transfected parasites  were fully infective to macrophages, and continued to express transgene-encoded protein reactive by immunofluorescence . within  <dig> hours, alt- <dig> and alt- <dig> expressing lines were able to infect significantly more host cells , a contrast that was sharply accentuated by day  <dig> of culture . moreover, >90% of macrophages infected with alt-transgenic l. mexicana harboured at least  <dig> parasites, compared to <50% of cells infected with the wild-type, and overall there was a 3-fold difference in mean parasite load per macrophage. this enhancement was manifest in both alt- <dig> and alt- <dig> transgenic lines and did not affect the total number of macrophages surviving through the culture period. in contrast, transfectants expressing an unrelated filarial gene, the cystatin bm-cpi- <dig>  <cit> , have no effect on survival of l. mexicana in murine macrophages . thus, the observed effect is gene-dependent and is not an attribute of the transfection system.

enhanced virulence of alt-expressing l. mexicana promastigotes
analysis of transgene function in the more complex setting of in vivo infection was also performed, in order to test more stringently whether alt products interfere with immunity. in two experiments, the alt-transfectants elicited larger lesions more quickly than either the parental wild-type strain of l. mexicana , or a transfectant encoding gfp . in both experiments, the effect of alt transfection was to accelerate lesion development to a plateau after 8– <dig> weeks, while control parasites reached similar levels only after 12– <dig> weeks. recovery of parasites from the footpads of infected mice also showed marked exacerbation: parasites were detected in our assay in 94%  of animals given transfected l. mexicana compared to 50%  of those receiving wild-type parasites  .

nitric oxide production and susceptibility to no-mediated killing
because nitric oxide generation is known to be a primary factor in the control of parasite survival in macrophages  <cit> , we compared levels of the no-metabolite nitrite from j <dig> macrophages infected with the different parasite lines. no production was assayed 24- and 48-hours post-infection, as the differences in parasite numbers are apparent from an early stage. irrespective of the transgenic status of the parasite, macrophages produced near-identical amounts of no in culture medium, measured by nitrite, at both time points ; thus the alt products do not abolish the reactive nitrogen burst. to test whether there was a quantitative reduction in either no responses or parasite sensitivity to destruction, we infected cells that had been previously stimulated with lps and a range of doses of ifn-γ. survival was measured by enumeration of infected macrophages  <dig> days later. figure 4b shows that alt-transfected parasites not only achieve higher infection levels in unstimulated macrophages , but survive better in cells stimulated with intermediate ifn-γ doses  than do wild-type organisms. interestingly, the production of nitrite was comparable at each ifn-γ dose in all parasite types , indicating that the alt products are likely to be interfering in an no-independent pathway of immunity.

gene expression in infected macrophages
to gain insight into what other mechanisms may be at play, we tested mrna from macrophages infected with wild-type or transfected l. mexicana against an array of  <dig> genes associated with immune responsiveness formatted on the mouse cytokine expression array  <dig>  . two independent experiments were performed, and hybridization of -labelled cdna was measured by phosphorimaging of spots of interest. little difference was seen in hybridization for inos, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  or many other known players in the pro- and counter-inflammatory cascades. the constancy of inos expression following transfection is consistent with the measurements of nitric oxide production discussed above. however, other pro-inflammatory players  were down-regulated relative to wild type in both alt - <dig> and alt - <dig> transfection, in replicate experiments. moreover, substantial shifts in mrna expression were consistently observed with certain products known to modulate the type-1/type- <dig> balance. bone-marrow-derived macrophages, infected  <dig> days earlier with wild-type l. mexicana infection, showed significant ablation of gata- <dig> and socs- <dig>  but expression was maintained or enhanced in cells infected with alt-transgenic parasites . these effects were reproduced with both alt genes in both experiments .

because array hybridization may under certain conditions be non-linear with respect to mrna concentrations, we performed quantitative rt-pcr with gata-3- and socs-1-specific primers on replicate samples of infected macrophages taken at  <dig> h  and  <dig> days . for gata- <dig>  these data reinforce the conclusion that while wild-type infection results in a 2–3-fold loss of gata- <dig> expression, alt-transgenic infected macrophages maintain the level of this transcription factor throughout the course of in vitro infection . interestingly, socs- <dig> is sharply upregulated by  <dig> h in all infected macrophages, but elevated expression remains evident only where alt transgenic parasites are present . although it is possible that larger parasite numbers in the alt-transfection system may in themselves alter macrophage gene expression, parasite densities were only slightly shifted at  <dig> h, when gata- <dig> expression was markedly different in wildtype and transfected cell infections.

up-regulation of gata- <dig> and socs- <dig> in filarial infection
we then tested whether gata- <dig> and socs- <dig> are up-regulated by live infection with b. malayi larvae in vivo. mice were injected i.p with  <dig> larvae, and  <dig> days later peritoneal cell populations were recovered by lavage with medium. we then performed real time pcr on an adherent macrophage enriched cell population and a non-adherent cell population, predominantly lymphocytes. as shown in figure 6a and 6c, the macrophage-rich adherent population showed a modest increase in both gata- <dig> and socs- <dig> expression, whereas a very substantial rise in both was seen in the non-adherent cells . it seems that b. malayi infection results in up-regulation of the same genes as observed with alt in macrophages, in both macrophage and non-macrophage subsets.

the acidic domain of alt is essential for biological function
the enhanced virulence phenotype conferred by alt transfection, measured by in vitro infectivity to macrophages, provides a ready and tractable system for submolecular analysis of functional domains of the alt protein. we investigated whether the n-terminal acidic domain, which is unique to the filarial genes, was important for the immunological activity of the protein. we constructed a truncated mutant of alt- <dig>  named acidic domain deleted , which was cloned into the pssu vector and electroporated into l. mexicana. these transfectants expressed immuno-reactive protein  and were able to infect bone marrow-derived macrophages. however, add-transfected parasites did not display the greater infectivity seen with alt-transfectants, but showed a phenotype indistinguishable from wild-type parasites . thus, the acidic domain is required for functional expression of the immunological effects of the alt proteins. similar analyses will permit the future definition of the critical residues required for immunomodulatory activity.

discussion
long-lived helminth parasites have evolved highly effective strategies to evade host immunity, requiring both adaptation of existing genes and evolution of new gene families  <cit> . with genomes that encode many thousands of proteins, these parasites are likely to be repositories of numerous novel 'immune evasion genes' with no or only weak sequence similarity to known products  <cit> . the imminent completion of genome sequence information for major helminth parasites  <cit>  accentuates the problem of how to identify functional immune modulators among numerous novel gene sequences. we hypothesized that transcripts for secreted immunomodulatory proteins would be among the most abundant mrnas at key points in the parasite life cycle. two such genes are those that encode the abundant larval transcripts  proteins, which are released by larval parasites ready to infect the mammalian host and represent 5% of the total mrna at this stage  <cit> .

to test whether the alt proteins are functional immune evasion products, we transfected each alt gene into l. mexicana and showed that infection of macrophages in vitro is exacerbated by expression of either alt protein. moreover, mice infected with alt-transgenic parasites display more rapid lesion development and higher parasite burdens than controls. our results also demonstrate that alt-transfected parasites are more resistant to inf-γ-induced killing by macrophages, supporting our hypothesis that alt proteins act to modify host immune responses in filarial infection. these data validate the transfection strategy in general and, in highlighting changes in key intracellular factors resulting from alt expression, justify the selection of a protozoal carrier to test the function of a helminth gene.

a further advantage of the system we describe here is the facility with which selected mutants can be analysed with an in vitro read-out of infectivity to macrophages. we constructed a deletion mutant lacking the n-terminal acidic domain, which shows most variation between filarial species and is not present in distantly related genes from free-living nematode organisms. this deletion showed a clear-cut abolition of the alt phenotype, indicating the essential functional nature of this sequence and paving the way for a finer analysis of structure-function relationships in a tractable experimental system.

we have also extended the use of this transfection system to the analysis of other parasite genes that are hypothesised to be immunomodulatory. for example, filarial parasites produce homologues of mammalian macrophage migration inhibitory factor, mif  <cit> , a cytokine generally considered to be an acute pro-inflammatory agent  <cit> . it is, however, paradoxical that long-lived tissue pathogens produce a potentially inflammatory mediator, and we therefore used the leishmania transfection system to test the hypothesis that long-term mif production may promote parasite survival. l. mexicana organisms transfected with b. malayi mif homologues were tested first in vitro, in which setting they were less infective to macrophages, rarely exceeding one parasite per host cell. this result was consistent with an immediate pro-inflammatory action of mif on macrophages. however, when tested in vivo over a 4- or 8-week-period, mif-transfected parasites were able to survive better than wild-type, indicating that over the longer term, filarial mif homologues are able to exert a down-modulatory effect on host immunity . we are now using this system to analyse the gene expression profiles of macrophages infected with mif-transfected parasites in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

these data illustrate the facility with which the leishmania transfection system can be used in parallel for in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the importance of an in vivo read-out to assay gene effects within the immune system as a whole. in addition, our work has demonstrated that leishmania transfection for helminth gene analysis is equally applicable for two completely unrelated, but immunologically important, gene families.

the application of this new strategy to transfection of l. mexicana is ideally suited to the study of macrophage modulation by genes predicted to function in this environment. parallel investigations can also be envisaged by transfection of l. major, which will permit a more thorough analysis of t cell modulation to be undertaken. for example, resistance to l. major is clearly associated with development of a parasite-specific th <dig> response, and it is possible that parasite genes that inhibit th <dig> differentiation will alter the course of l. major infection in vivo. these studies are now under way.

macrophages are known to be a critical cell population in the immune response to filarial parasites at successive points in time. first, they participate in innate defences against invading larvae  <cit> ; second, if infection becomes established, they evolve an il-4-dependent "alternatively activated" phenotype, which is broadly immunosuppressive  <cit> ; and third, in late stage infection, they clear the bloodstream of microfilarial forms through a nitric oxide-dependent pathway  <cit> . thus, the reduction in ifn-γ-responsiveness in macrophages harbouring alt-transfected parasites has resonance for initial host susceptibility, and longer-term propensity for chronic infection, as well as the ability to eliminate the blood-borne mf stage.

a key outcome of the present study is that alt expression is associated with up-regulation of gata- <dig> and socs- <dig>  gata- <dig> is a pivotal transcription factor for the development and function of the th <dig> pathway  <cit>  and has not previously been reported in mouse macrophages; hence, at the present time, downstream genes activated by gata- <dig> in macrophages have not been defined. significantly, gata- <dig> is required for embryonic development and has recently been shown to be essential for the differentiation  <cit>  and effector function  <cit>  of murine eosinophils. thus, gata- <dig> expression in macrophages may fulfil an important role, possibly in conjunction with the altered phenotype of these cells in chronic parasite infections  <cit> .

socs- <dig> is a member of the suppressor of cytokine signalling family of proteins, which regulate signal transduction by ifn-γ and structurally related cytokines  <cit> . socs- <dig> is particularly important in macrophage responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli  <cit> , countermanding ifn-γ by directly inhibiting the jak kinase associated with the ifn-γ receptor  <cit> . socs- <dig> is known to inhibit the ifn-γ-dependent killing of leishmania parasites, because macrophages from socs- <dig> null mice require 100-fold less ifn-γ to clear infection  <cit> . indeed, in the absence of socs- <dig>  there is generalised activation of the immune system, causing autoimmune pathology  <cit> . thus, by up-regulating socs- <dig>  cells expressing alt may have down-shifted responsiveness to inflammatory cytokines, requiring exogenous stimulation to induce leishmania killing . in the context of brugia infection, socs- <dig> induction by alt proteins could explain why macrophages fail to develop the ifn-γ-activated phenotype, and instead express a counter-inflammatory profile  <cit> .

overall, these data suggest that the alt proteins play a role in the evasion strategy of the filarial nematode, by directly amplifying th <dig> responses and/or interfering with signals necessary for the development of pro-inflammatory th <dig> populations. it is interesting to note that in vivo exposure to live infective larvae of b. malayi induces a prompt th <dig> response measurable by  <dig> h and increasing to  <dig> days post-infection  <cit> . we have repeated these experiments by intraperitoneal inoculation of live l <dig> and find up-regulation of gata- <dig> and socs- <dig> in both adherent and non-adherent peritoneal cells .

CONCLUSIONS
the novel approach we have described permits, for the first time, the elucidation of gene function for a major group of biologically and medically important parasites, which in the example presented here provides non-intuitive results linking parasite secretions to host cell signalling. the transfection strategy will also accommodate a mutagenesis analysis of structure-function relationships in unique gene families. in conclusion, our system provides a solution to one of the major obstacles facing helminth parasite immunology in the post-genomic era and offers a fascinating insight into the molecular and cellular intricacies of pathogen manipulation of host immune responsiveness.
