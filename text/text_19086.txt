BACKGROUND
the dna double-strand break  is a major type of cellular damage induced by ionizing radiation. in mammalian cells, dsb in chromatin promptly initiates the phosphorylation of histone h2ax at ser <dig> to generate γ-h2ax foci in megabase regions localized around each individual break, which is an essential and efficient coordinator of recognition and repair of dna damage to ensure the maintenance of genomic stability  <cit> . the h2ax-/- mouse displays multiple phenotypes, such as enhanced radiosensitivity, delayed growth and immune defects  <cit> . the h2ax gene, a member of the h2a family, is located at 11q <dig> -q <dig> , and encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein. in response to dna damage, h2ax is phosphorylated in the c-terminus at ser <dig>  part of a consensus sqe  motif that is a common recognition site for phosphorylation by the phosphatidylinositol-3-oh-kinase-like family of protein kinases   <cit> . phosphorylation of h2ax can be mediated by all three major pikk proteins, atm  <cit> , atr  <cit>  and dna-dependent protein kinase  <cit> . h2ax phosphorylation by atm, which is linked to the induction of dsbs, has been widely reported  <cit> . phosphorylation of h2ax by atr has been shown to occur in response to uv-induced dna damage  <cit>  or replication stress  <cit> . dna-pkcs is the catalytic subunit of the dna-pk complex, in which the ku <dig> and ku <dig> heterodimer binds to the ends of broken dna, and dna-pkcs is recruited to form the active kinase complex. dna-pkcs was shown to be activated in nucleosomes via ku binding to the ends of nucleosomal dna. activated dna-pkcs is capable of phosphorylating h2ax within nucleosomes, and histone acetylation stimulates the phosphorylation of h2ax largely by dna-pkcs  <cit> . dna-pkcs has also been shown to phosphorylate h2ax during apoptotic dna fragmentation  <cit> , and is responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of h2ax under hypertonic conditions  <cit> . a direct connection between γh2ax foci formation and disappearance, and dna-pk activity, has also been demonstrated in response to replication stress induced by low levels of the replication inhibitor aphidicolin  <cit>  and replication-associated dna damage  <cit> . in addition, h2ax phosphorylation was also found to be dependent on dna-pk in the dna damage response induced by the death receptor ligand trail  <cit> . as all three pikk members are able to phosphorylate h2ax, it is important to understand which plays the dominant role in phosphorylating h2ax in response to gamma radiation-induced dna damage. burma et al. previously reported that h2ax phosphorylation at ser <dig> after x-irradiation is atm-dependent in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> , while stiff et al. showed that both atm and dna-pk can promote radiation-induced phosphorylation of h2ax in human and rodent cells  <cit> . koike et al. have recently reported that the regulatory mechanism of γh2ax generation is tissue-specific in mice, and that h2ax phosphorylation at ser <dig> in the spleen after x-irradiation is mainly mediated by dna-pk  <cit> . therefore, further investigation is needed to elucidate the coordination of atm and dna-pkcs in regulating h2ax phosphorylation in response to different stimuli or conditions.

in addition, γh2ax dephosphorylation is another mechanism by which cellular levels of γh2ax may be regulated, and dephosphorylation of γh2ax is also important for completing the dna repair process. in order to restore chromatin integrity and structure after the repair process, phosphorylated h2ax must be converted to h2ax, which is in principle accomplished either by replacing γh2ax in the nucleosome with h2ax, or by dephosphorylating nucleosomal γh2ax directly. in mammalian cells, the phosphatases pp2a and pp <dig> have been shown to be involved in the dephosphorylation of γh2ax  <cit> .

using sirna-mediated depletion of dna-pkcs, atm-deficient cells, the pi3k kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and the specific inhibitor of dna-pkcs nu <dig>  we now show that dna-pk plays a crucial role for h2ax phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation and during cell cycle progression.

the agc family ser/thr kinase protein kinase b /gsk3β is a common downstream signaling pathway of both dna-pkcs and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  <dig> , in which akt is fully activated through phosphorylation of two key residues, thr <dig> by pdk <dig>  <cit>  and ser <dig> by dna-pkcs  <cit>  in response to dna damage. the phosphorylated akt can then inactivate gsk3β by phosphorylating it on ser <dig>  therefore, we have further determined whether akt/gsk3β signaling involves in the regulation of h2ax phosphorylation. we found that inactivation of gsk3β using licl or specific sirna, can upregulate γh2ax levels and block the decrease in γh2ax caused by loss of dna-pkcs. sirna-mediated inhibition of pdk  <dig> can also downregulate the levels of γh2ax. our results demonstrate that dna-pkcs is a critical kinase, which regulates the level of phosphorylated h2ax independent of atm.

RESULTS
dna-pkcs is required for h2ax phosphorylation in response to dna damage induced by ionizing radiation
a stable cell line, in which dna-pkcs expression was downregulated via sirna , was generated from hela cells . depletion of dna-pkcs resulted in an increased sensitivity to radiation  and decreased repair of dna double-strand breaks  . comet assays showed that 80% of ir-induced dsb, as measured by the tail moment, were repaired at  <dig> h after  <dig> gy in the dna-pkcs-expressing hela-nc cells, compared to only 30% dsb repair in hela-h <dig> cells. after  <dig> gy, the level of γh2ax in hela-nc cells was quickly elevated, reaching a peak at about  <dig> h post-irradiation. in contrast, the level of γh2ax was barely increased in dna-pkcs-silenced hela-h <dig> cells , indicating that dna-pkcs is necessary for the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to radiation. in order to confirm this result, we detected the γh2ax level in hepg2-h <dig>  another dna-pkcs depleted cell line generated from hepg <dig> cells transfected with a specific sirna constructs targeting the dna-pkcs catalytic motif . it was found that the induction of γh2ax by  <dig> gy in hepg2-h <dig> cells was also much lower than that in control hepg2-nc cells .

to determine the relative contributions of atm and dna-pkcs to the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to dna damage, we measured changes in γh2ax levels in two atm-deficient cell lines, at5biva and ats <dig> after  <dig> gy γ-irradiation . an increased autophosphorylated dna-pkcs on ser <dig> was induced at least  <dig> to  <dig> min after  <dig> gy in these two cell lines . as shown in figure 2d, a clear increase in γh2ax was induced in at5biva cells at  <dig> - <dig> h after γ-irradiation, although the amount of increased γh2ax level was slightly less than that of hela cells. unexpectedly, the atm-deficient cell line ats <dig> showed a high constitutive level of γh2ax . indeed, the level of γh2ax in ats <dig> cells under normal growing conditions was so high that radiation did not induce any further increase. wortmannin has inhibitory activity against both atm and dna-pk, and it effectively reduced the induction of h2ax phosphorylation by radiation in at5biva cells . to more specifically investigate the role of dna-pk in radiation-induced h2ax phosphorylation, we used the competitive and highly specific dna-pk inhibitor nu <dig>  treatment of cells with  <dig> μm nu <dig> largely abolished the radiation-induced phosphorylation of h2ax in at5biva cells  as well as atm efficient hela-nc cells . these data indicate that dna-pkcs plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to dna damage.

dna-pkcs is required for h2ax phosphorylation associated with cell cycle progression
to synchronize cells, thymidine was used to block cells at the g1/s transition by reversibly inhibiting dna synthesis, without affecting the progression of other cell cycle phase. different phases of synchronized cells were obtained by harvesting cells at different times after release from a thymidine-induced g <dig> block . as shown in figure 3b , the majority of the cell population was in s-phase  at  <dig> h and proceeded into g2/m phase 8- <dig> h after release from the g <dig> block in both hela-h <dig> and hela-nc cells. however, the s-phase population of hela-h <dig> cells at 8- <dig> h after release  was higher than that of hela-nc cells . consistently, the g2/m-phase proportion of hela-h <dig> cells  was relatively lower than that of hela-nc cells  .

an alteration of phosphorylated h2ax level associated with cell cycle progression has been observed . in hela-nc cells, γh2ax levels gradually increased  <dig> h after release from the g <dig> block, and reached a peak at 8- <dig> h, i.e. with the majority of cells in g2/m-phase. this cell cycle associated increase of γh2ax levels in the dna-pkcs-depleted hela-h <dig> cells was much lower than that in control hela-nc cells. the expression peak in hela-h <dig> cells was delayed to  <dig> h after the g <dig> release and was also much weaker than in hela-nc cells. treatment with  <dig> μm wortmannin inhibited the cell cycle-associated phosphorylation of h2ax . moreover, the dna-pkcs specific inhibitor nu <dig> also largely abolished this cell cycle-associated phosphorylation of h2ax . therefore, we conclude that dna-pkcs is required for the phosphorylation of h2ax associated with cell cycle progression. in order to determine whether atm is necessary for the cell cycle-associated phosphorylation of h2ax, we examined γh2ax levels in synchronized atm-deficient cells. an increase in γh2ax was clearly seen at 8- <dig> h after release from the g <dig> block for two atm-deficient cell lines, ats <dig>  and at5biva .

the akt/gsk3β signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of h2ax phosphorylation
to explore the potential alternative mechanism by which dna-pkcs regulates h2ax phosphorylation, we investigated the role of akt and gsk3β, downstream targets of both dna-pkcs and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  <dig> , in the regulation of γh2ax. indeed, depletion of pdk by rnai led to not only a decrease in phosphorylated akt on thr <dig> and ser <dig> , but also inhibition on the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to  <dig> gy  and in g2/m-phase cells . these results indicate that akt/gsk3β signaling could play an important role in regulating the phosphorylation of h2ax. as shown in figure 6b, sirna-mediated downregulation of dna-pkcs led to a decrease in the phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig>  and of gsk3β at ser <dig>  as well as activation of gsk3β which is negatively regulated by akt. treatment with  <dig> μm licl, an inhibitor of gsk3β, prolonged the duration of increased γh2ax levels to at least  <dig> h post-irradiation . licl treatment also increased γh2ax levels in the thymidine-synchronized hela cells in g2/m phase, i.e. 8- <dig> h after release from g <dig> block . moreover, downregulation of gsk3β expression by specific gsk3β sirna  also significantly enhanced and prolonged the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to irradiation  and in g2/m phase cells . it has been reported that phophatase pp2a and pp <dig> can dephosphorylate γh2ax  <cit> . we demonstrated that the increased γh2ax induced by gsk3β inhibitor or specific sirna molecules is equivalent to that induced by the pp2a inhibitor fostriecin . taken together, these data suggest that the akt/gsk3β signaling pathway could also be involved in regulating the dephosphorylation of γh2ax.

discussion
dna dsb induced by gamma irradiation, or other dsb inducers, leads to rapid phosphorylation of h2ax at ser <dig> by atm, atr and dna-pkcs, resulting in γh2ax  <cit> . the foci formed by γh2ax can recruit dna damage response proteins, such as brca <dig>  53bp <dig>  and mdc <dig>  to initiate dna repair  <cit> . in addition, other related proteins such as nbs, chk <dig>  smc <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig>  are also co-localized to γh2ax foci, but these proteins may be indirectly induced by other dna damage response proteins  <cit> . after γh2ax marks sites of dna damage, the damage recruits repair proteins and dephosphorylation of γh2ax is necessary for release of repair proteins from the damage sites to complete the dna repair process. the protein phosphatases 2a  and pp <dig> were previously shown to be responsible for dephosphorylation of γh2ax  <cit> . it has been debated as to whether ser <dig> of h2ax is phosphorylated by atm alone or both atm and dna-pk after ionizing radiation  <cit> . our data indicate that  <dig> gy irradiation can rapidly induce h2ax phosphorylation , and that γh2ax then declines to normal levels after  <dig> h in hela cells. depletion of dna-pkcs by sirna significantly abolished the ir-induced phosphorylation of h2ax in hela-h <dig> cells.

it was reported that deficiency of dna-pkcs causes downregulation of atm in hela cells  <cit> . consistent with this, the atm protein level was also decreased in hela-h <dig> cells in concordance with the reduced dna-pkcs , and this further contributes to the dramatic reduction of γh2ax in hela-h <dig> cells. a dramatic decrease of ir-induced γh2ax was also demonstrated in the dna-pkcs-depleted hepg2-h <dig> cells . in contrast, a dramatic increase in γh2ax was induced by radiation in atm-deficient at5biva and ats <dig> cells . moreover, ats <dig> cells had a very high constitutive level of γh2ax . in addition, the dna-pkcs-specific inhibitor nu <dig> can effectively abolish ir-induced phosphorylation of h2ax.

koike et al recently reported that the level of γh2ax also increased in mice lacking either atm or dna-pk following x-irradiation  <cit> , and they suggested that the phosphorylation of h2ax and the elimination of γh2ax following radiation proceeds in both dna-pk-dependent and independent manner in vivo. furthermore, they also demonstrated a tissue-specific mechanism of γh2ax level regulation, e.g. the phosphorylation of h2ax at ser <dig> after x-irradiation in the spleen is mainly mediated by the dna-pk  <cit> . low doses of replication-inhibitor aphidicolin  induce dsbs in replicating cells, and the formation of these dsbs requires bloom's syndrome-associated  helicase and mus <dig> nuclease  <cit> . these aph-induced blm and mus81-dependent dsbs activate the phosphorylation of h2ax by atr kinase, while the dsbs are transient and appear to be rapidly repaired by dna-pk-dependent non-homologous end joining   <cit> . therefore, it could be more complicated than generally considered regarding the regulatory mechanisms of γh2ax levels after dna damage induced by ionizing radiation. our findings further suggest that dna-pkcs plays no less important role than does atm, or both are functionally complementary to each other, in modulating of h2ax phosphorylation in response to dna damage induced by ionizing radiation. phosphorylated h2ax has also been reported in untreated normal and tumor cells, which can be explained as the consequence of a physiological event that involve dna recombination  <cit>  or due to dna damage induced by reactive oxygen species  generated by metabolic activity during progression through the cell cycle  <cit> . the increased constitutive γh2ax seen in ats <dig> cells could reflect the high levels of residual dna damage.

information regarding the association of h2ax phosphorylation and cell cycle progression is scarce. one report showed atr-mediated phosphorylation of h2ax generated during dna replication  <cit> . kurise et al. reported that blocking hl- <dig> cells at the g1/s transition by treatment with inhibitors of dna replication  resulted in h2ax phosphorylation at ser <dig>  and that this effect is most pronounced in s-phase cells and in cells undergoing induced apoptosis  <cit> . in this study, we found that a peak of h2ax phosphorylation appeared when synchronized hela cells entered the g2/m phases, but not in g1-arrested cells or in cells during s-phase . these results are consistent with a previous report by ichijima et al  <cit> . atm deficiency did not significantly affect cell cycle progression-associated h2ax phosphorylation , but loss of dna-pkcs by the sirna strategy  or chemical inhibitors  led to a marked decrease in γh2ax levels. therefore, we conclude that dna-pkcs also plays a key role in regulating h2ax phosphorylation associated with cell cycle progression. in addition, dna-pkcs depletion can lead to some delay in g2-phase entry .

the agc family ser/thr kinase protein kinase b  was originally identified to be a central regulator of cell metabolism, survival, and proliferation. following mitogen stimulation, akt is fully activated through phosphorylation of two key residues, thr <dig> in the activation loop and ser <dig> in the c-terminal hydrophobic motif. akt/thr <dig> is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  <dig>   <cit> , while akt/ser <dig> is a target of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex  <dig>   <cit> . akt/ser <dig> has been also identified as one of the downstream substrates of dna-pkcs in response to dna damage  <cit> , and the phosphorylated akt can inactivate gsk3β by phosphorylating it on ser <dig>  the direct phosphorylation of akt on s <dig> by dna-pk requires a specific recognition sequence in the c-terminal hydrophobic motif surrounding the ser- <dig> phospho-acceptor site in pkb  <cit> . bozulic et al have recently shown that pdk <dig> is responsible for akt/thr <dig> phosphorylation in the dna damage induced by ionizing radiation, and gsk <dig> phosphorylation after dna damage depends on both dna-pk-mediated and pdk1-mediated activation of akt  <cit> . in pdk1-/- cells, phosphorylation of akt/thr <dig> was not detected after ionizing radiation, and phosphorylation of akt/ser <dig> was also much lower than in wild-type cells. this was further reflected by the lack of phosphorylation of gsk3α although dna-pkcs was active in pdk1-/- cells. our data demonstrate that inhibition of gsk3β by sirna or licl resulted in increased phosphorylation of h2ax in g2/m phase cells  and after irradiation . inhibition of gsk3β prolonged the time of γh2ax elevation after radiation, and which implicates gsk3β in promoting dephosphorylation of γh2ax. therefore, we suggest another pathway of dna-pkcs affecting the h2ax phosphorylation level, i.e., dna-pkcs activates akt via phosphorylation on ser <dig>  which in turn inactivates gsk3β via phosphorylating ser <dig>  <cit> . the inactivated gsk3β loses its effect of negatively modulating the γh2ax level. furthermore, depletion of pdk  <dig>  an upstream regulator of akt, by rnai also results in a decrease in radiation-induced  and cell cycle associated  phosphorylation of h2ax, this further supports the involvement of akt/gsk3β in regulating the γh2ax level.

CONCLUSIONS
the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of h2ax is necessary for the dna damage repair process. in mammalian cells, there are likely multiple pathways involved in modulating γh2ax in response to dna double-strand breaks  induced by ionizing radiation. our results further demonstrate that dna-pkcs plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of h2ax in response to both dna damage and g2/m phase entry. dna-pkcs can both directly phosphorylate h2ax and indirectly modulate the γh2ax level through the akt/gsk3β signaling pathway. more studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of gsk3β regulating the γh2ax level in response to the dna damage and during cell cycle progression.
