BACKGROUND
alterations in splice site choice, referred to alternative splicing , can result in mrna is forms coding for proteins with different chemical and biological activity  <cit> . as events can be generally classified into the following categories: cassette exon , exon skipping , mutually exclusive exon , alternative 5' splice site selection , alternative 3' splice site selection  and intron retention   <cit> . early estimates suggest that at least 60% of human genes may undergo as  <cit> . now, with the application of next generation sequencing  technologies, it has been revealed that almost all genes  in the human genome will undergo as  <cit> , highlighting its important roles in the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression. however, although much research work has been dedicated to the understanding of the as phenomenon, the regulatory mechanism of as is still not fully understood.

it has been widely accepted that chromatin state plays essential roles in regulating gene expression. dna methylation, nucleosome occupancy and modifications of histone are involved in determining the chromatin state  <cit> , while some transcription factors  can bind to specific regulatory regions to interact with chromatin and regulate gene expression  <cit> . all these factors can be considered as epigenetic features that regulate gene expression from a broad perspective  <cit> . though epigenetic signatures are mainly found to be enriched in promoters, it has become increasingly clear that they are also present in exon regions, indicating a potential link of epigenetic regulation to splicing  <cit> . for example, dna methylation level shows distinctive differential patterns between intron and exon  <cit> . histone modifications such as h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  h2bk5me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  and h3k27me <dig> were found to be related with exon expression  <cit> .

since epigenetic features have been implied to have a connection with splicing, naturally we wonder whether they may also be involved in as. indeed, nucleosome occupancy level was found to be lower in cassette exons than in constitutively spliced exons  <cit> . h3k36me <dig> and h3k9ac were found to be related to the exon skipping event of ncam  <cit> . the level of h3k36me <dig> was found to be different in mutually exclusive exons of fgfr <dig>  tpm <dig>  tpm <dig>  and pkm <dig> between pnt <dig> and hmsc cell types. h3k36me <dig> was also found to be depleted in skipped exon in a genome-wide study across different species  <cit> , though this finding was still in an argument  <cit> . other histone methylations, such as h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  were found to be associated with the as events of fgfr <dig>  <cit> , while h3k4me <dig> was suggested to affect the as events of chd <dig>  <cit> , and h3k9me <dig> was found to be associated with the multiple exon skipping of cd <dig>  <cit> . a recent chip-chip assay also found that the levels of  <dig> histone modifications are different in between ce and constitutively spliced exon   <cit> . despite the accumulating evidence suggesting a potential connection between epigenetics and as, to date there have been no systematic studies on investigating the association of epigenetic features with different types of as.

in this study, we have collected epigenetics data from six cell lines and carried out a comprehensive computational survey to investigate the association of different types of as with epigenetic features, such as dna methylation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications , and protein features  . we find that a number of epigenetic features are strongly associated with as. based on their association pattern with as events, these epigenetic features are grouped into four clusters, with the first cluster including h3k36me <dig>  rna pol ii, and a set of tfs and showing strongest association with all types of as events. in addition, based on their association with the epigenetic features, the as events are classified into two general classes: the exon skipping related process  including es and me and the alternative splice site selection process  including a3ss, a5ss and ir. thus, our study highlights the potentially important roles of epigenetic regulation on as, and provides list of epigenetic features strongly associated with as, making it possible to design experiments to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of as.

RESULTS
in this study, we explore whether epigenetic regulation is likely involved in as by investigating the association of epigenetic features with as. the epigenetic features include dna methylation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications and some protein features. we focus on comparing the association level of each feature around the splice sites of between the alternatively spliced exon  and the constitutively spliced exon . here, the types of ase being investigated include only the alternative spliced internal exons, such as me, es, a3ss, a5ss and ir. es only refers to the single exon skipping event. details on the definition of internal exons and how to determine these ase types can be found in methods and additional file  <dig>  when evaluating the significance of the association, we divide the regions surrounding the acceptor and donor splice sites into the intronic and exonic regions each with a length of  <dig> bp , respectively, and compute a p-value in each region to indicate the significance of difference in between a type of ase and cne for a given feature. the difference is considered statistically significant if the p-value is smaller than 1e- <dig>  in the following sections, unless otherwise specified, if a feature is said to be higher or lower in a given type of ase, then it always refers to the results of comparison with the level of the feature in cne; if no specific region, e.g., the exonic or intronic region, is mentioned, then it implies that the association is true for all the regions; in addition, if there are available data for a given feature in two or more cell lines, the results are always averaged across all available cell lines.

the association of dna methylation and nucleosome occupancy with as
here, we investigate whether the level of genomic cpg dinucleotides  and the percentage of methylated cpg dinucleotides  are different in between ase and cne. the mcg data is obtained from a study of dna bisulfite sequencing  of h <dig> hesc and imr <dig> cells  <cit> . the nucleosome occupancy dataset is obtained from a study using high-throughput sequencing after mnase digestion in resting cd4+ cells  <cit> .

we find that me and es have significantly lower level of both cg and mcg in the exonic regions . in contrast, ir has significantly higher level of cg in both the exonic and intronic regions; yet, its mcg level in the exonic region is significantly lower while in the intronic region is significantly higher. for both a3ss and a5ss, their associations with cg and mcg are generally not as significant as that with the other types of ase, though the association is significant in some regions . the association patterns of mcg with the ase in individual cell lines are similar to the above results .

for nucleosome occupancy, we find that its level is significantly lower in the exonic regions of both me and es, with the results of me more significant than that of es . this finding is consistent with several early reports that es has lower nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . the nucleosome occupancy level is also significantly lower in the intronic region of the donor splice site of ir. both a5ss and a3ss do not have strong association with nucleosome occupancy. the overall association patterns of nucleosome occupancy with ase are similar to that of mcg's, indicating a potential connection between them in as.

the association of histone modifications with as
we obtain histone modification data from several recently published chip-seq studies  <cit> . we select  <dig> histone methylations and  <dig> histone acetylations that have available data in at least two cell lines . the distribution of each histone modification is drawn by averaging the chip signal across all cell lines.

among the histone methylations we investigate, h3k36me <dig>  is the only one that is significantly associated with all types of ase in all regions, though the association patterns are different: its level is significantly lower in me and es and significantly higher in a3ss, a5ss and ir. a previous study also reported that es has a lower h3k36me <dig> level  <cit> . the level of h3k <dig> methylations, including h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> , is almost all significantly higher in a3ss and a5ss except that the significance of the association of h3k4me <dig> with ase is in between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in some regions. however, these h3k <dig> methylations show different association patterns with ir, es and me: the level of h3k4me <dig> is significantly higher in the intronic region of ir and in most regions of me; the level of h3k4me <dig> is higher in the intronic region of the donor splice site of ir and significantly lower in most regions of es; the level of h3k4me <dig> is significantly lower in es. for the other histone methylations, the level of h4k20me <dig>  is significantly higher in a3ss, a5ss and ir; the level of h3k27me <dig>  is significantly higher in the exonic region of es; the level of h3k79me <dig>  is significantly higher in a3ss and a5ss, and slightly higher in the intronic region of es; the level of h3k79me <dig>  is significantly higher in me, a3ss and a5ss, and most region of ir; the level of h3k9me <dig>  is significantly higher in a3ss, a5ss and most regions of ir. however, h3k9me <dig>  is not significantly associated with any type of ase.

histone acetylations are not as significantly associated as histone methylations with as . we only find that the level of h3k9ac and h3k27ac  are higher in a3ss and a5ss, while the level of h3k14ac is slightly higher in the intronic region of me .

the association of protein features with as
besides the above-mentioned well known epigenetic features, other features, such as tfs, ctcf and rna pol ii are also thought to be related with the modification of chromatin structures  <cit> . despite that there have been no report on the association of these tfs with the splicing machinery, given their relationships with chromatin structure, it is reasonable to hypothesize that some of them may be involved in splicing either directly or indirectly, and therefore may likely have an impact with as. for example, a recent study reported that the rate of rna pol ii elongation might have an impact on as  <cit> , while ctcf was found in a recent study to be related to the alternative splicing of cd <dig> gene  <cit> . however, to date the relationships of these tfs with as have not been systematically investigated. here, we analyze the association pattern of  <dig> tfs, ctcf and rna pol ii that have chip-seq data  <cit>  of more than  <dig> cells with as.

interestingly, we find the level of egr <dig>  gabp, sin3a, srf and rna pol ii  are all significantly higher in a3ss, a5ss and ir, and significantly lower in me and es, except for sin3a in the intronic region of the acceptor splice site of es ; in addition, their levels all steadily increase in from me, es, cne, a3ss, a5ss to ir, which is similar to the results of h3k36me <dig>  such association patterns also hold true in all individual cell lines . though not as significantly associated with as as the above-mentioned proteins, rest  shows higher level in a3ss, a5ss and ir, and lower level in me and es, but not for all regions. taf <dig> shows higher level in a5ss, the exonic region of a3ss and the intronic region of ir, but lower level in the exonic region of me . similarly, usf <dig> shows higher level in a3ss, ir and most regions of a5ss, but lower level in the exonic region of me . ep <dig> only shows higher level in the exonic region of a3ss and a5ss. in contrast, spi <dig> and ctcf appear not strongly associated with any type of ase . our ctcf result is not consistent with shukla et al's finding that ctcf is related to alternative splicing of cd <dig>  <cit> . however, ctcf was found to be closely associated with histone methylation boundaries in between the active and inactive domains  <cit>  suggesting it is less likely to exist in gene body. we also find that in general the signal level of ctcf around the splice site is very low, indicating it rarely binds near the splice site.

clustering of epigenetic features by its pattern in different as types and clustering of as types by its epigenetic pattern
by applying a k-means clustering procedure, we discover four clusters of epigenetic features on the basis of their association with ase . the first cluster shows strongest association with as, which includes four tfs , rna pol ii and h3k36me <dig> whose levels all show steadily increased patterns in from me, es, cne, a3ss/a5ss to ir. the second cluster includes six histone methylations: h3k79me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  h4k20me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  and one histone acetylation: h3k9ac. features in this cluster generally show higher level in a3ss, a5ss and ir , while their association patterns with es and me are complex. the third cluster includes cg, mcg, rest, taf <dig> and usf <dig>  which features have similar association pattern with as to those in the first cluster, though less significant. the fourth cluster comprises of nucleosome occupancy, ep <dig>  spi <dig>  ctcf, h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and  <dig> types of histone acetylations. features in this cluster generally do not have strong association with as except for nucleosome occupancy, h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k27ac, and ep <dig> 

in addition to clustering epigenetic features, we cluster the as types into two classes on the basis of their association with each epigenetic feature. one cluster includes me and es, while another includes a3ss, a5ss, and ir. in general me and es can be considered as the exon skipping related process  that involves the inclusion or skipping of one or more complete internal exons, while a3ss, a5ss and ir can be considered as the alternative splice site selection process  that involves the selection of splice site within an internal exon. our results therefore suggest that these two classes of as may be under different epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. in figure  <dig>  we summarize the epigenetic features showing unique association pattern with esrp and assp, respectively. there are features, such as cg, mcg, h3k36me <dig>  rna pol ii and five tfs , that are associated with both esrp and assp; however, their levels are lower in esrp but higher in assp, compared to that in cne. the epigenetic features uniquely associated with either esrp or assp include nucleosome occupancy that is lower in esrp, and five histone methylations  and two tfs  that are all higher in assp. each type of ase inside the same cluster also has its own uniquely associated epigenetic features. in esrp, me has higher level of h3k79me <dig> and h3k4me1; es has significantly lower level of h3k27me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig>  and significantly higher level of h3k79me <dig>  although ir is grouped together with a3ss and a5ss in assp based on their association patterns with epigenetic features, it also has noticeably different patterns from them. for example, ir has significantly higher level of h3k27me <dig>  and significantly lower level of nucleosome; in contrast, both a3ss and a5ss have higher level of h3k27ac, h3k9ac, h3k79me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and ep <dig>  suggesting that different epigenetic mechanisms may take place when regulating ir or a3ss/a5ss.

correcting the effect of chip-seq input and nucleosome occupancy
all above results are obtained by counting the raw sequence reads from the chip-seq studies of the epigenetic features. since there may be significant background noise which may cause some bias to the results, we perform the analysis by correcting for the chip-seq input data. five of six cell lines we investigate in this study have the available input data of chip-seq. we fist inspect whether there is any difference for the input data in between different types of ases and cnes. the results show that in general, except for me and ir, the input data have very similar distribution pattern in all ases and cnes . interestingly, the level of input data is higher in me than in cne, while it is lower in ir than in cne, which are opposite to the association patterns of most epigenetic features using the raw sequence reads. based on the distribution pattern of the chip-seq input data across different types of ases and cnes, our major findings should remain the same. to further illustrate the effects of input data, we select two cell lines, gm <dig> and k <dig>  that have available data of the epigenetic features belonging to cluster  <dig>  and the input data, and perform the analysis again by correcting for the input data. the distribution patterns of these epigenetic features around the splice site after correcting for the input data remain the same as before . the statistic analysis also shows that before and after the correction, the p-values of these epigenetic features in the two cell lines are similar , suggesting that our major conclusions are unlikely to be affected by correcting for the input data.

it has been reported that most histone modifications are related to the positioning of nucleosomes  <cit> . in this study, nucleosome occupancy is found to have similar association patterns with as to that of most modifications , though its significance level is considerably lower. to investigate how significant nucleosome occupancy may contribute to the association of other features with as, we perform the analysis by correcting for nucleosome occupancy. however, since nucleosome data is available only for cd4+ cell lines, among the significantly associated epigenetic features we only do the correction for h3k36me <dig> and rna pol ii which have available data in that cell line. the results show that the association patterns of these two features remain the same as before, and the statistic tests are still significant, though the significance level of es, me and a5ss is lower than before . additionally, for all other epigenetic features with available data in cd4+ cell lines, the results show that after the correction for nucleosome occupancy, their association patterns are still similar to before . thus, we conclude that nucleosome alone is not enough to explain the association of other epigenetic features with as.

discussion
prior to our work, there have been a number of studies on how epigenetic features may affect splicing  <cit> . it has been proposed that specific histone modifications may help to recruit related tfs or splicing factors or to change the rna pol ii elongation efficiency, which can affect splicing. as rna pol ii elongation efficiency may play a role in affecting splicing, we reason that higher level of rna pol ii around the splice sites may correspond to lower rna pol ii elongation rate, which can help promote splicing efficiency. based on our findings that the level of rna pol ii is significantly higher in assp while significantly lower in esrp, here we propose that lower rna pol ii elongation rate may be necessary for selecting the alternative splice site, while higher rna pol ii elongation rate can facilitate the exon skipping events. specific histone methylations, such as h3k36me <dig>  may help to recruit general tfs like egr <dig>  gabp, srf, sin3a, rest, taf <dig> and usf <dig>  which can help to retain rna pol ii around the splice site and promote assp; while other histone methylations, such as h4k20me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  may provide additional help for this process. in the absence of h3k36me <dig>  the above-mentioned general tfs may not be recruited, making it easy for rna pol ii to pass through the splice site, and resulting in esrp events. our model explains the general difference between the assp and esrp events.

in this study, the transcriptional effects are not taken into consideration when analyzing the association of epigenetic features with different types of ases. this is because of the following reasons. firstly, not all cell types investigated in this study have the available exon-array or rna-seq data that were obtained under the same condition as that of the epigenetic features, making it difficult to reduce the transcriptional effects across different cell types. secondly, even in cell line in which the exon-array or rna-seq data were available, we find that there are usually significant variations of expression level in between the individual exons of a given gene, making it impossible to reduce the transcriptional effects on different types of exons. thirdly, transcription level is a result of both epigenetic regulation and splicing, even with available data it may be difficult to distinguish the effects of epigenetic regulation from the effects of transcription level. nevertheless, by focusing on comparing the distribution of epigenetic features in between a specific type of as exons and the cnes that are determined by comparing all ensemble transcripts between each other, we are able to identify the statistically significant differences for some epigenetic features that are consistent across different cell lines. this highlights the likely difference of epigenetic regulation on potentially alternatively spliced exons from that on constitutively spliced exons.

exon length may be another factor that affects the results of our analysis, because we do not separate exons by using different cutoff. however, the short exons  and the long exons  only account for a small portion of all exons , and therefore are unlikely to affect the results. in our analysis, we define the regions surrounding the splice site to be ±  <dig> nt to the splice site. when the regions are defined to be ±  <dig> nt to the splice site, the results remain almost the same . in addition, kolasinska-zwierz et al. studied the alternative splicing of exons longer than  <dig> nt, which excluded most exons , and found that the level of h3k36me <dig> is lower in es compared to cne  <cit> , which is consistent with our findings, further suggesting that exon length is unlikely to affect our conclusions. on the other hand, it has been shown that most epigenetic features have completely different patterns in both tss and polya than in gene body  <cit> , while the levels of some histone modifications are increased from tss to polya while the levels of some are decreased, hinting that the positional effects on the level of epigenetic features may cause some bias to our conclusions. in our analysis, we exclude as types such as alternative first exon and alternative last exon and only consider exons that are not within  <dig> bp to tss and polya. to further clarify the possible positional effects, we group ases and cnes based on their positions , and repeat the analysis for the most significant epigenetic features  on two cell lines . the results suggest that their patterns at different positions exons remain the same as before , indicating that the positional effects of the distribution of epigenetic features are unlikely to affect our conclusions. however, our analysis only focuses on the protein coding transcripts that are alternatively spliced, and the conclusion may not be directly applicable for as of non-coding transcripts which were recently found to have different epigenetic signatures from protein coding transcripts  <cit> . on the other hand, we focus only on the regions surrounding the splice sites, and do not consider the epigenetic features in the intronic regions far from the splice sites, which may also contribute to as.

in this study, we have uncovered a number of epigenetic features strongly associated with different types of as. some of the findings are consistent with other studies. for example, our finding on h3k36me3's association with es is consistent with kolasinska-zwierz et al.'s  <cit> , though their study involved less number of exons. a recent study performed by dhami et al. found that  <dig> histone methylations are associated with the splicing of cassette exon  <cit>  in which nine of them are investigated in this study. since dhami et al. did not report the p-value of the associations, we compare the tendency of the association of these epigenetic features in their study with ours. except for h3k4me <dig>  the tendency of all the other features is consistent with ours. however, because of the adjustment of multiple tests, four of them, h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  are significant in our study. the possible difference can be attributed to the following reasons: dhami et al. used the chip-chip data, while we use the chip-seq data; they analyzed the as events of only  <dig> well expressed genes, while we carry out a genome-wide study; they analyzed three cell lines, while we analyze six cell lines. it is worth noting that these recent studies are limited because their studies either focused on data from single cell line  <cit> , or used chip-chip data which are considered to have lower quality compared to chip-seq data  <cit> . in contrast, our study uses the chip-seq data from six cell lines to investigate the associations of not only histone methylations but also other epigenetic features, such as tfs, with as, and discovers a number of epigenetic features significantly associated with as, in which many of them are first reported, including egr <dig>  gabp, srf, sin3a, etc. these discovered significant epigenetic features will be useful to guide experimentalists to design specific experiments to further explore the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on as.

CONCLUSIONS
our results reveal that epigenetic features are strongly associated with as, suggesting that epigenetic regulation may be involved in as. by applying a clustering procedure, we identify four tight clusters of epigenetic features, with features in the first cluster showing strongest association with as. the as events are grouped to two classes: the exon skipping related process   and the alternative splice site selection process   on the basis of their association patterns with epigenetic features, indicating that these two processes may involve different mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.
