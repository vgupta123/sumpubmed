BACKGROUND
fusarium graminearum is one of the main causal agents of fusarium head blight  in small grain cereals  <cit> . although fhb symptoms have a classical impact on yield, the major concern referred to fhb is the presence of mycotoxins. fusarium spp. are able to produce a plethora of mycotoxins with diverse chemical and biological features  <cit> . this toxin fingerprint, inherent to the genetics of each individual strain, determines the chemotype of each particular fusarium isolate. f. graminearum chemotypes are mainly characterized by type b trichothecenes among which deoxynivalenol , acetyldeoxynivalenol  and nivalenol  are the most prevalent  <cit> .

although the genetic background of type b trichothecene production has been studied elaborately, a coherent view on the production profile of these mycotoxins during infection and colonization of a host is lacking and identifying or understanding mechanisms that regulate the production of these secondary metabolites remains a challenge  <cit> . to date, the role of the type b trichothecene don during infection and colonization of plants remains a controversial issue. using don non-producing fusarium strains, the importance of don production during spread of the fungus throughout the grain host was demonstrated  <cit> . in concordance, don production elicits defence responses in wheat  <cit> . this role for don as a virulence factor, actively produced during the infection process, has been confirmed in many other studies  <cit> . notwithstanding these compelling lines of evidence, other authors uncouple don production from colonization and aggressiveness  <cit> . the aforementioned controversy illustrates nicely that besides the genotypical derived don-chemotype, many environmental triggers are crucial to unequivocally delineate the don-production by a strain of fusarium. the involvement of external influences triggering don production is further corroborated by research illustrating modulation of don production by either abiotic factors such as aw, temperature, available carbon and/or nitrogen source, and biotic factors such as presence of other fungi  <cit> .

the importance of these external triggers in don production is consolidated by the observation that the production level of mycotoxins in axenic in vitro cultures is often orders of magnitude lower than observed during infection and colonization of a host, suggesting that specific host signals are involved in eliciting mycotoxins production. the secondary plant signalling compound hydrogen peroxide , which is involved in plant-fungi interactions, is highlighted as an possible trigger interfering with type b trichothecene production. in previous work with f. graminearum, it was demonstrated that exogenously applied h2o <dig> at time of spore germination resulted in higher don and a-don levels  <dig> days later  <cit> . in addition, this don accumulation was accompanied by an up-regulation of the tri gene machinery, responsible for don biosynthesis  <cit> . moreover, liquid cultures of f. graminearum supplied with h2o <dig> started to produce h2o <dig> themselves and the kinetics of this paralleled with don accumulation  <cit>  indicating a link between don production and oxidative stress. notwithstanding this clear observation, underlying mechanisms remain elusive. recently, evidence is brought forward that the response of fusarium to h2o <dig> is chemotype dependent. ponts et al.  observed a reduced niv production in these chemotypes upon exogenous h2o <dig> application while the opposite was observed in don chemotypes. furthermore these data suggest that niv isolates combine this adaptation to oxidative stress with a proliferated virulence  <cit> .

the application of fungicides as possible external triggers for thrichothecene biosynthesis remains a controversial issue. several authors have described that sublethal concentrations of fungicides trigger thrichothecene biosynthesis  <cit> . others report opposite results  <cit> .

the objective of the present work, was to investigate the influence of three fungicides i.e. prothioconazole , azoxystrobin  and prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin, applied at sub lethal concentrations on don production by f. graminearum. triazoles are known inhibitors of the ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi while strobilurin fungicides inhibit mitochondrial electron transport by binding the qo site of cytochrome bc <dig> complex. where the effectiveness of triazole fungicides against fusarium spp. is a certainty, the activity of strobilurins against fusarium spp. is doubtable.

the hypothesis of a fungicide-induced oxidative stress response as a trigger for don biosynthesis was evaluated by a combined approach of h2o <dig> measurements and application of the h2o <dig> scavenger enzyme catalase. finally, the work was validated on a laboratory scale in an in vivo assay using wheat plants. the present work clearly demonstrates the risks of reduced fungicide doses with respect to don accumulation.

RESULTS
effectiveness of fungicides to inhibit conidial germination and to reduce fungal biomass
strobilurins and triazoles are among the most frequently used fungicides to respectively control m. nivale and f. graminearum. nevertheless, application of these chemicals is often suboptimal due to the short vulnerable period of the pathogen in the field , and environmental factors such as rain and wind. to determine if suboptimal fungicide treatments influence germination of f. graminearum conidia and don production, an in vitro assay was set up using a dilution series of azoxystrobin, prothioconazole and fluoxastrobin + prothioconazole. azoxystrobin did not influence the f. graminearum conidial germination at any of the given time points in a concentration-dependent way . in contrast, prothioconazole effectively inhibited conidial germination at field dose and in dilutions 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> but did not have a significant effect at lower doses at time point  <dig> h . at time intervals  <dig> h and  <dig> h, intermediate concentrations caused a temporary delay in germination. finally the combination of prothioconazole and fluoxastrobin exhibited fungicidal activity at field concentration and inhibited germination in dilutions 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> and displayed no or very little effect in dilution 1/ <dig> . similar results were observed at the level of mycelial radial outgrowth .

the effect of the different fungicides on conidial germination was also reflected in the amount of fungal biomass as measured by q-pcr analysis . these q-pcr data clearly highlighted an effect of prothioconazole and protioconazole + fluoxastrobin on fusarium growth.

f. graminearum biomass expressed as ng/μl. in each run, a no-template control was included. the amount of fungal material was measured based on a standard series of f. graminearum dna ranging from  <dig> ng/μl down to  <dig>  ng/μl which was carried out in triplicate.

effect of fungicides on don production
to check whether the effect of the strobilurin fungicides and the triazole fungicide prothioconazole on fungal biomass and germination was paralleled by a reduced production of the type b trichothecene don, levels of this mycotoxin were measured using a competitive elisa-approach . as expected, application of azoxystrobin did not influence don production by f. graminearum strain 8/ <dig>  remarkably, the combined application of prothioconazole and fluoxastrobin triggered a huge production of don at the sub lethal doses of dilution 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig>  as early at time point  <dig> h but not at earlier time points . for the sole application of prothioconazole no major effects on don production were observed since none of the tested concentrations were sub lethal. in an additional experiment using an extra intermediate concentration of 1/ <dig> of the field concentration of prothioconazole, a reduced spore germination of about 50% was observed . concomitant with this observation, this sub lethal dilution resulted in an increased don production . hence, application of sub lethal concentrations of respectively prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin and prothioconazole seems to result in the activation of the trichothecene biosynthesis machinery leading to an accumulation of don as fast as  <dig> h after the start of the experiment.

timely production of h2o <dig> precedes don accumulation in combined strobilurin and triazole fungicide application
as several lines of evidence in literature corroborate an important role for reactive oxygen species  and more specifically h2o <dig> in stress responses of fungi, the accumulation of h2o <dig> upon fungicide application was monitored in the established in vitro germination assay. in these experiments, we unequivocally demonstrated that sole application of respectively azoxystrobin and prothioconazole at the given concentrations did not result in elevated h2o <dig> concentrations at any of the time points . in addition, prothioconazole at field dose resulted in lower h2o <dig> concentrations than those observed in control samples possibly reflecting the reduction in microbial metabolic activity due to the application of the fungicide. sub lethal dilutions of the combined application of fluoxastrobin + prothioconazole  resulted in an increased h2o <dig> content in the medium compared to the control and the other treatments as fast as  <dig> h after the start of the germination assay. although the increase at concentration 1/ <dig> was less proliferate than the increase at concentration 1/ <dig> of the field dose of fluoxastrobin + prothioconazole, it was consistent in all performed experiments. moreover, this peak in h2o <dig> disappeared or was less proliferated at later time points  <dig> h and  <dig> h. these findings strongly suggest that timely production of h2o <dig> triggers the trichothecene biosynthesis machinery to produce don in sub lethal fungicide treatments.

to further examine the role of h2o <dig> in fungicide-induced stress, exogenous catalase was added together with the fungicidal treatment. at  <dig> h after application, catalase resulted in a reduced germination rate  compared to all non-catalase treatments. in addition, at later time points, the application of catalase partially abolished the fungicidal effect of prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin  and of prothioconazole  at both the level of conidial germination and fungal biomass . no effect was observed in the treatment with azoxystrobin . in addition, this partial loss of fungicidal effect due to the application of catalase was accompanied by the disappearance of the h2o <dig> peak previously observed in the prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin treated samples at  <dig> h after application of prothioconazole . no peak was observed in the treatment with sole application of prothioconazole . at later time points, no h2o <dig> accumulation was observed in none of the treatments . finally, completely in line with these observations, the disappearance of the h2o <dig> trigger at  <dig> h due to the application of catalase resulted in don production comparable to control treatments .

stress-induced h2o <dig> accumulation upon fungicide application is necessary and sufficient as a trigger to induce don
to further decipher a direct link between h2o <dig> at one hand and the production of the mycotoxin don at the other hand, the accumulation of don was monitored upon exogenously single pulse application of h2o2ranging from  <dig>  mm up to  <dig> mm. h2o <dig> influenced germination of f. graminearum conidia in a concentration-dependent manner . as early as  <dig> h after the start of the assay, exogenously application of h2o <dig> at concentrations from  <dig> mm up to  <dig> mm retarded or stopped conidial germination. the sub lethal concentration of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> induced don production as fast as  <dig> h after application of h2o <dig> in one of the experiments. in the other experiment,  <dig> h was probably just too early to observe the increased don production and in this experiment, the increment in don was observed at  <dig> h. the ability of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> to initiate don production is in concordance with h2o <dig> concentrations induced by sub lethal prothioconazole concentrations . at later time points, don did not further accumulate and concentration remained the same for the subsequent  <dig> and  <dig> h time points. this effect of h2o <dig> on don production was confirmed by an experiment in which h2o <dig> was eliminated from the well plates by exogenously applied catalase. this resulted in a fall-back of the don production in the  <dig> mm h2o <dig> treatment to levels comparable to control wells . finally, surprisingly, low concentrations of h2o <dig> facilitated conidial germination compared to control samples. indicating the necessity of low levels of h2o <dig> in optimal germination of conidia and proliferation of fungal cells.

sublethal prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin application triggers don production in vivo
in an in vivo case study with azoxystrobin and prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin, the effect of sub lethal fungicide concentrations on growth and don production was verified on wheat plants  during anthesis. a point inoculation with f. graminearum clearly led to typical fusarium symptoms  <dig> days after inoculation . in the treatment with azoxystrobin, no reduction of symptoms was observed  which is in concordance with the previously described in vitro data. application of prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin resulted in a complete control of fusarium at field dose or dilution 1/ <dig> . at concentration 1/ <dig> symptoms were apparent although they were less proliferate than in the inoculated control plants pointing to a sub lethal concentration. parallel with the symptom evaluation, don content was determined in the wheat ears. no don was apparent in treatments with field dose or dilution 1/ <dig>  however, a significant increase in don content was observed in ears originating from the 1/ <dig> treatment compared to the control treatment  which is in concordance with the in vitro observations.

discussion
in an effort to broaden our understanding of external triggers influencing the don production machinery of f. graminearum, the effect of strobilurin and triazole fungicides on don production was investigated. our results demonstrate that prothioconazole, a triazole fungicide, has good control capacities culminating in reduced vegetative radial outgrowth, a reduced conidial germination and a reduction of f. graminearum biomass. triazoles are known inhibitors of the ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi and have been described for their good control capacities against fusarium spp  <cit> .

on the contrary, the strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin was not able to induce a reduction in radial outgrowth, spore germination and fungal biomass. strobilurin fungicides inhibit mitochondrial electron transport by binding the qo site of cytochrome bc <dig> complex. although the effectiveness of strobilurins against fusarium spp. is doubtable, they have been reported to be effective against f. culmorum  <cit>  apparently, f. graminearum is very resistant to this type of fungicides. resistance to strobilurin fungicides has been reported in many species to be associated with a single amino acid replacement at position  <dig> of the cytochrome b gene  <cit> . although this mechanism was recently described in microdochium nivale it has not yet been described in f. graminearum. we assume that the observed resistance is therefore possibly a consequence of the activation of a respiratory chain using an alternative oxidase  bypassing complexes iii and iv in the cytochrome mediated pathway. activity of this aox mediates electron transfer directly from ubiquinol to oxygen. kaneko and ishii  demonstrated that f. graminearum acts very rapidly upon strobilurin application by the activation of aox whereas m. nivale, a fungal species susceptible to strobilurins, reacted slowly with a retarded moderate activation of this enzyme  <cit> .

since the generation of reactive oxygen species such as h2o <dig> is a hallmark of an oxidative stress response, extracellular h2o <dig> was measured upon fungicide application in an in vitro assay. unexpectedly, application of strobilurin fungicides did not result in an increased extracellular h2o <dig> formation, which is at first sight, contradictory to previous findings by kaneko and ishii  who found an increased production of h2o <dig> upon strobilurin application. however it is important to notice that in the present work the h2o <dig> released in the medium was measured whereas kaneko and ishii  focused on intracellular h2o <dig>  remarkably, the application of sub lethal doses of prothioconazole or the combination of prothioconazole amended with fluoxastrobin resulted in a boosted h2o <dig> production as fast as  <dig> h after application. this prompt production disappeared at later time points. in addition, a clear induction of don production was observed  <dig> h after application of sub lethal prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin concentrations. this induction of don was confirmed in an in vivo experiment in which flowering wheat plants were infected with f. graminearum and subjected to a sub lethal dose of prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin. previous work on f. culmorum demonstrated no or a negative effect of several strobilurins and triazoles on don production  <cit>  so the observed phenomenon of an increased don production by f. graminearum induced by sub lethal concentrations of triazole fungicides might be a strain- or species-specific phenomenon.

it is tempting to speculate whether this accumulation of don is the consequence of the preceding accumulation of h2o <dig> as such being the first link in a signalling cascade activated upon sub lethal triazole treatment. although this key role of h2o <dig> is not unambiguously demonstrated in the present study, the amount of evidence is compelling: h2o <dig> precedes accumulation of don, combined application of catalase  inhibited don accumulation. in addition, the application led to a reduced activity of the triazole fungicide. application of h2o <dig> to f. graminearum cultures led to a reduced germination and prompt induction of don biosynthesis  <dig> h after h2o <dig> application. this additional experiment proves that h2o <dig> accumulation is necessary and sufficient to initiate don production. the activation of the don biosynthesis machinery by h2o <dig> is in concordance with previous observations by the group of barreau  <cit>  who demonstrated that exogenously applied h2o <dig> by repeated single or pulse-feeding resulted in accumulation of don. however, these authors only monitored increases in don at late time points such as  <dig> to  <dig> days after h2o <dig> application whereas we observe a clear prompt activation of don production within hours. from a physiological point of view the effect of h2o <dig> during the initial germination events is logic and in line with the physiology of an in field f. graminearum infection: h2o <dig> is one of the key regulators in the plant defense system upon pathogen attack  <cit> . therefore, this molecule is encountered frequently and at early time points by the pathogen in the interaction with its host. previous work by the group of john manners demonstrated beautifully that don itself can induce hypersensitive cell death and h2o <dig> during infection  <cit>  and as such underpinning the interaction between both molecules.

astonishingly, very low concentrations of h2o <dig> promoted conidia germination rate where a reduction was expected. we hypothesize that during germination events, very small amounts of h2o <dig> are beneficial and necessary in the primordial germination- and hyphal extension events. it is known that h2o <dig> is necessary in de novo synthesis of cell wall and membrane components during germination and hyphal extension. indirect evidence for this was provided by seong et al  who observed high activities of the peroxisomes at the onset of spore germination  <cit>  the need for basal h2o <dig> is subscribed by the observation that catalase treatment results in a reduced spore germination at very early time points in germination. in several independent studies, it was demonstrated that reactive oxygen species such as h2o <dig> are key players and crucial in the regulation of cell differentiation in microbial eukaryotes  <cit> . in accordance with this, it was demonstrated that nadph oxidases which generate reactive oxygen are decisive in fungal cell differentiation and growth in a model system using neurospora crassa  <cit> .

taken together, these results not only reinforce the hypothesis that h2o <dig> can induce don biosynthesis but also suggest that don accumulation induced by sub lethal triazole application is mediated through an increased production or release of h2o <dig> into the medium rendering a physiological interface of h2o <dig> influencing don production. it is tempting to speculate on the mechanistics behind these observations. we hypothesize that due to the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis by the application of triazole fungicides, an increased cell permeability results in the increased release of h2o <dig> in the medium which in turns activates the trichothecene biosynthesis machinery. indeed, although h2o <dig> is a very reactive molecule which can diffuse freely across bio membranes, it has been shown in a sacharomyces model system that organisms prevent h2o <dig> diffusion  <cit> . this hypothesis is subscribed by accumulating indirect evidence in many other fungi. as such in candida ergosterol depletion increases vulnerability to phagocytic oxidative damage  <cit> . in sacharomyces it was demonstrated using ergosterol knock out mutants that ergosterol depletion results in a changed biophysical property of the plasma membrane leading to an increased permeability towards h2o <dig> <cit> .

although beyond the scope of the present paper it is important to notice that triazole fungicides on their own can generate h2o <dig> in planta as an intermediate metabolite in plants through activation of antioxidant systems  <cit>  generating as such a greening effect which results in a retardation of the senescence  <cit> . the effect of this physiological induced h2o <dig> in planta on don production by an invading f. graminearum is till now not studied and certainly needs more attention in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work it was shown that sub lethal prothioconazole concentrations resulted in a significant increase in don production by f. graminearum in a combined approach of an in vitro assay and an artificial infection trial. in the in vitro assay, the stimulated don production was preceded by a prompt induction of h2o <dig> suggesting that the proliferated don production was induced by an oxidative stress response in the fungus. this hypothesis was confirmed by exogenous application of catalase which abrogated the elevated don production observed at the sub lethal doses of prothioconazole. in a broader framework, this work clearly shows that don production by the plant pathogen f. graminearum is the result of the interaction of fungal genomics and external triggers. further work is needed to characterise the effect of these external triggers influencing don biosynthesis. this work will certainly lead to a better insight into factors that influence don production under field conditions.
