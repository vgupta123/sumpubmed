BACKGROUND
the development of the mammary gland is hormonally regulated  <cit> , but the actions of locally-derived growth factors and the interaction of mammary epithelial cells with their surrounding stroma are also critical factors for successful development  <cit> . mammary epithelial cells interact with the extracellular matrix predominantly through the stromal components collagen and laminin  <cit> . lactogenic differentiation is associated with the deposition of laminin-rich matrix by the epithelial cells  <cit>  and the degree of differentiation of mammary epithelial cells correlates with their response to basement membrane and stromal protein-induced signals. in addition, the production of milk proteins by the secretory epithelium is dependent on the presence of specific mitogens  <cit> , cell-cell contact  <cit> , stimulation by the lactogenic hormone prolactin  <cit> , and interaction with the extracellular matrix  <cit> .

β <dig> integrin expression is required for the survival of epithelial cells during differentiation  <cit>  and it contributes to mammary gland development and morphogenesis  <cit> . the interaction of β <dig> integrin with laminin is critical for the initiation of the transcription of the milk protein β-casein  <cit> . in addition, during lactogenic differentiation the activation of the prolactin receptor ultimately results in the translocation of phosphorylated stat <dig> dimers to the nucleus where they bind dna and regulate transcription  <cit> , and integrin-mediated adhesion is critical for the activation of stat <dig>  <cit> . in vitro studies of the interaction between mammary epithelial cells and basement membrane proteins during transcription of milk proteins recently implicated the swi/snf transcription factor, brg <dig>  in translating signals from the stroma to the activation of the β-casein promoter  <cit> .

our previous work determined that connective tissue growth factor , a known stromal mediator, is highly up-regulated during the lactogenic differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells in a glucocorticoid-dependent response  <cit> . that study demonstrated that transient expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> enhanced β-casein transcription during the lactogenic differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells and that sirna-mediated depletion of ctgf/ccn <dig> blocked the process  <cit> . ctgf/ccn <dig> is a member of the ccn family of matrix-associated proteins, which are known to be involved in processes including the regulation of growth, differentiation, migration and adhesion  <cit> . members of the ccn family are comprised of  <dig> homology domains: the n-terminal insulin-like growth factor binding protein  homology domain, followed by the von willebrand c  repeat domain, the thrombospondin type  <dig>  repeat domain, and the c-terminal cysteine knot  domain  <cit> . ctgf/ccn <dig> is known to interact with β <dig> integrin complexes through its tsp <dig> and c-terminal domains  <cit> . because functional β <dig> integrin complexes are required for lactogenesis in vivo and in vitro, our studies focused on the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> expression on this axis in mammary epithelial cells.

the studies presented here employed hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells, a cell line capable of lactogenic differentiation in vitro  <cit> , that has been used in our previous studies  <cit> . hc <dig> cells are non-transformed, immortalized, and undergo lactogenic differentiation upon stimulation with dexamethasone, insulin and prolactin  <cit> . to address the mechanism by which ctgf/ccn <dig> contributes to the regulation of lactogenic differentiation, ctgf/ccn <dig> was expressed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter in hc <dig> cells. the results confirm and extend our previous findings that ctgf/ccn <dig> mediates the enhancement of multiple markers of lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, ectopic expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> increased the formation of focal adhesion complexes, integrin-mediated survival signaling and cell adhesion. hence, these findings suggest that ctgf/ccn <dig> acts to stabilize the cell-matrix interactions required for cell survival by multiple mechanisms, and this translates directly and indirectly into enhanced lactogenic differentiation as measured by the subsequent phenotypic changes and the transcription of β-casein.

RESULTS
ectopic ctgf/ccn <dig> expression enhanced the lactogenic differentiation of hc <dig> cells
previous studies conducted in our laboratory demonstrated that ctgf/ccn <dig> was transcriptionally regulated by the glucorticoid dexamethasone during the induction of lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> cells, and that elevated ctgf/ccn <dig> expression was required for the differentiation program  <cit> . to elucidate the mechanism by which ctgf/ccn <dig> enhances the lactogenic differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, a stable hc11-based cell line was created by employing inducible expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> under the control of a tet-responsive promoter . analysis of these cells revealed that the expression of vector-encoded ctgf/ccn <dig> readily increased following the removal of doxycycline from the culture media  <cit> . following induction of ctgf/ccn <dig> expression in hc <dig> cells its effect on lactogenic differentiation was evaluated by the addition of the lactogenic hormone mixture of dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin  to the cultures. known markers of lactogenic differentiation, including β-casein transcription and mammosphere formation, were analyzed.

the formation of domed structures called mammospheres occurs during lactogenic differentiation of hc <dig> cells in culture and serves as a phenotypic marker of this process  <cit> . the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> expression on mammosphere formation was examined following stimulation of hc11-tre-ctgf and the vector control hc11-tre cells with dip for five days. the hc11-tre-ctgf cells displayed enhanced mammosphere formation, both in the size  and number , compared to the identically treated vector control cells.

the transcription of the milk protein β-casein is a marker of lactogenic differentiation. our previous studies demonstrated that transient expression of ctgf in hc <dig> cells enhanced β-casein transcription compared to control cells  <cit> . hence, confluent cultures of hc11-tre-ctgf and hc11-tre cells were stimulated with lactogenic hormone and assayed for differentiation by following β-casein transcription. because endogenous ctgf/ccn <dig> is rapidly induced by dexamethasone, a component of the lactogenic hormone mix, the expression of β-casein rna was examined in untreated cells and prior to  <dig> hours of dip treatment. at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post dip stimulation the effect of vector-encoded ctgf/ccn <dig> on this process  was detected. the results indicated a higher level of β-casein transcription at  <dig> hours in the hc11-tre-ctgf cells compared to the hc11-tre cells, confirming that ctgf/ccn <dig> expression enhances transcription of β-casein in the hc <dig> cell line. in addition, the tet-regulated ctgf/ccn <dig> expression resulted in low but detectable β-casein in the absence of added lactogens  suggesting that a low level of lactogenic hormone, presumably contributed by serum in the media, could induce β-casein transcription in the presence of ctgf/ccn <dig> 

the contribution of ctgf/ccn <dig> to β-casein promoter activation was assessed by evaluating the binding of stat <dig> to the β-casein promoter via a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay . stimulation of hc <dig> cells with prolactin activates jak <dig> resulting in stat <dig> phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation and dna binding. control and ctgf-expressing hc <dig> cells were stimulated with the lactogenic hormone mix for  <dig> hours. the treated cells were fixed in formaldehyde, the nuclei were isolated and sonicated, and stat5-dna complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation. the β-casein proximal promoter was amplified from the purified recovered dna in order to determine the level of stat <dig> dna binding. results, shown in figure 1d, revealed that elevated ctgf/ccn <dig> expression led to a modest but reproducible increase in the binding of stat <dig> on the β-casein proximal promoter in the induced but not the unstimulated cells. in repeated experiments  the outcome ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  fold greater binding in tre-ctgf than the tre control cells. the fact that detection of stat <dig> promoter binding required extended dip-stimulation  diminished the differences between the control and ctgf/ccn2-expressing cells that were observed at the level of β-casein rna. however, this result supported the finding of increased β-casein transcription in ctgf/ccn2-expressing cells.

ctgf/ccn <dig> increased acinar formation by mcf10a cells
the formation of polarized acini-like spheroids that mimic aspects of the architecture of the mammary gland in vivo is a marker of differentiation for the immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line mcf10a  <cit> . the mcf10a cells form spheroids on matrigel and this is followed by apoptosis-driven clearing of the lumen of these structures. the formation and differentiation of the spheroids relies on integrin engagement for the orientation and polarization of the cells to form three dimensional structures. because ctgf/ccn <dig> expression enhanced the formation of the hc <dig> cell domed mammospheres, the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> on the formation of the acinar structures by mcf10a cells was examined. ctgf/ccn <dig> was supplied to the mcf10a cells exogenously in a purified and soluble form. in this assay mcf10a cells were suspended in matrigel in the presence or absence of ctgf/ccn <dig> and overlayed onto a solidified layer of matrigel. the cultures were maintained for  <dig> days, at which time the cells were fixed, stained and analyzed by confocal microscopy. the images, shown in figure 1e, depict individual dapi-stained acinar structures in the presence or absence of ctgf/ccn <dig> as sections from top to bottom of the acinus. initially, the presence of ctgf/ccn <dig> in the media enhanced both the size and the number of the spheroid structures formed by the mcf10a cells. however, over time the mcf10a cells cultured in the presence of ctgf/ccn <dig> also exhibited a high level of differentiation. this was characterized by a structured epithelial cell layer surrounding a hollow lumen. thus, ctgf/ccn <dig> influenced the growth and differentiation of both hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells in two-dimensional culture as well as mcf10a mammary epithelial cells in three-dimensional culture.

ctgf/ccn <dig> functioned via matrix interaction during β-casein transcription in hc <dig> cells
previous studies have shown that ctgf/ccn <dig> acts as a stromal mediator by binding to integrins and other components of the extracellular matrix  <cit> , and the activation of β <dig> integrin complexes by matrix components is required for β-casein transcription and lactogenic differentiation  <cit> . therefore, the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> on extracellular matrix regulation of β-casein transcription was examined. hc11-tre-ctgf and vector control cells were seeded on fibronectin-, collagen i-, or matrigel-coated or uncoated tissue culture dishes. following stimulation of the cells with lactogenic hormone, rna was extracted and used to analyze β-casein expression by northern blot. results are shown as the fold induction of β-casein transcription in each cell line grown on matrix proteins compared to the level of transcription on plastic . the results demonstrated a greater than 3-fold increase in β-casein transcription in hc11-tre vector control cells exposed to extracellular matrix components compared to tissue culture plastic. in contrast, hc11-tre-ctgf cells did not display a significant increase of β-casein transcription when grown on fibronectin, collagen i or matrigel. thus, it appears that ectopic expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> partially abrogates the influence of matrix components required to initiate β-casein transcription. moreover, the results suggest that ctgf/ccn <dig> contributes significantly to the collagen and laminin receptor engagement which is required for the initiation of hc <dig> mammary epithelial cell differentiation and β-casein transcription.

ctgf/ccn <dig> stimulation contributed to hc <dig> cell proliferation and survival
ctgf/ccn <dig> increased mitogenesis in numerous types of cells. previously published data from our lab demonstrated that elevated expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> in hc <dig> cells resulted in enhanced expression of β <dig> integrin and the activation of focal adhesion kinase   <cit> . thus, to determine the contribution of ctgf/ccn <dig> to integrin-mediated processes that effect the growth of hc <dig> cells, ctgf/ccn2-expressing hc <dig> cells were compared to vector control cells for proliferative capacity in the absence of serum. the proliferation was determined by mtt assay  and the results indicated hc11-tre-ctgf cells displayed significantly more proliferative capacity than the hc11-tre vector control cells. in particular, proliferation was sustained by ctgf/ccn <dig> expression at later times when the hc <dig> vector control cells ceased proliferation.

ctgf/ccn <dig> is a secreted protein and approximately half of the ctgf produced by the hc11-tre-ctgf cells is found in the media  <cit> . therefore, conditioned media from hc11-tre-ctgf cells was harvested and also used to determine the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> on the growth of hc <dig> cells. results, shown in figure 3b, indicated that ctgf/ccn2-conditioned media sustained the growth of hc <dig> cells longer than conditioned media from hc11-tre cells. again, the most significant differences were observed at later time points. together with the effect of endogenously produced ctgf/ccn <dig>  these results suggest that ctgf/ccn <dig> played a role in the proliferation of cells especially in the absence of serum. however, neither hc <dig> vector control, nor hc <dig> cells expressing or treated with ctgf/ccn <dig>  proliferated in the absence of egf . this indicated that the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> in the hc <dig> cells differed from those of egf on the same cells.

the apparent ability of ctgf/ccn <dig> to facilitate integrin-mediated processes and proliferation, suggested a role for ctgf/ccn <dig> in sustaining the survival of hc <dig> cells. therefore, the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> expression on the ability of hc <dig> cells to progress through the cell cycle in the absence of serum was examined. hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cells were harvested following  <dig> hours in serum-free media, stained with propidium iodide  and analyzed by flow cytometry. figure 4a contains a cell cycle analysis comparison of the hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cell lines. the data in figure 4b indicate the percentage of total hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cell populations in the sub g0/g <dig>  g <dig>  s, and g2/m phases of the cell cycle. in each cell line the majority of cells were in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, however, in support of the data suggesting sustained growth of hc <dig> cells by ctgf/ccn <dig>  the cells expressing ctgf/ccn <dig> had greater percentage of the population in both s and g2/m phases. in contrast, the hc11-tre vector control cells showed a greater population of cells in sub g0/g <dig>  which is indicative of possible apoptosis. to determine the level of apoptosis, the cells were examined for tunel, a measure of dna fragmentation characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. the results, shown in figures 4c, indicated a higher level of tunel staining in hc11-tre cells compared to the hc11-tre-ctgf cells.

because ctgf/ccn <dig> enhanced the survival of hc <dig> cells, the contribution of ctgf/ccn <dig> to the activation of integrin-mediated survival signaling was examined. protein lysates from hc11-tre-ctgf and hc11-tre vector control cells were collected after  <dig> hours in serum-free media and used to determine the expression of mediators of integrin adhesion and survival signaling . the results indicated that hc11-tre-ctgf cells display enhanced expression of β <dig> integrin, phosphorylated fak, phosphorylated akt, bcl-xl and cyclin d <dig> compared to expression levels in hc11-tre cells. the level of β <dig> integrin was slightly increased in the ctgf-expressing cells as well . these results indicated that ctgf/ccn <dig> contributed to integrin-mediated survival signaling in mammary epithelial cells and implicated the β1-containing integrin complex in the control of both proliferation and survival of hc <dig> cells.

ctgf/ccn <dig> increased integrin expression and function in hc <dig> cells
ctgf/ccn <dig> bound to and enhanced the expression of β <dig> integrin in other cell types  <cit> , and the activation of β <dig> integrin signaling is required for β-casein transcription  <cit> . hence, the degree to which the ctgf/ccn2-mediated effects on cell proliferation and survival were dependent on the ctgf/ccn2-induced integrin activation was tested. an mtt assay was performed in the presence of an integrin-binding rgd-containing peptide that would be expected to act as a competitive inhibitor for β <dig> integrin complexes including αvβ <dig> and α5β <dig>  as well as αvβ <dig>  hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cells were seeded in serum-free conditions with or without the rgd peptide or control rad peptide. levels of proliferation were determined by mtt assay. results, shown in figure 5a, displayed the expected enhanced proliferation trend of hc11-tre-ctgf cells compared to the vector control hc11-tre cells. the hc11-tre-ctgf cells incubated with the rgd peptide exhibited a 38% reduction in proliferative capacity at  <dig> hours, whereas the rad peptide showed no effect on the ctgf/ccn2-enhanced proliferation of the cells. in contrast, the rgd peptide inhibited growth of the tre cells by 7% during the same time period. hence, while the control cells express some endogenous levels of ctgf/ccn <dig>  it is the elevated expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> that provides a cell adhesion and survival advantage, and targeting those functions exposes the dependence on ctgf/ccn <dig> in the tre-ctgf cell line. these results suggested that the rgd peptide partially blocked the integrin engagement that occurred as a result of ctgf/ccn <dig> expression, thereby affecting growth and survival.

ctgf/ccn <dig> interacts with the α6β <dig> integrin complex in other cell types. α6β <dig> integrin is a common mammary epithelial cell receptor for laminin  <cit>  and β <dig> is critical for mammary gland development in vivo and milk protein synthesis in cultured mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . to evaluate the effect of ctgf/ccn <dig> on the levels of expression of these integrins, hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cells were incubated with antibodies against surface level α <dig> or β <dig> integrin and analyzed by flow cytometry. results, shown in figure 5b, indicated that hc11-tre-ctgf cells displayed a greater level of both α <dig> and β <dig> integrin on their surface compared to the hc11-tre control cells. together these results suggested that ctgf/ccn <dig> enhanced proliferation and survival signaling through the stabilization and activation of an α6β <dig> integrin complex or other α <dig> and β <dig> containing complexes.

hc <dig> cell adhesion to ctgf/ccn <dig> required integrin complexes
ctgf/ccn <dig> is a secreted, integrin binding molecule. to determine if ctgf/ccn <dig> was acting to mediate cell adhesion, the ability of hc <dig> cells to attach to either control or ctgf/ccn2-coated plates was tested. hc11-tre control cells were allowed to attach to recombinant ctgf/ccn2-coated microtiter wells for  <dig> hours. adherent cells were fixed and stained and the absorbance at  <dig> nm was determined for quantitation of cell adhesion. a significant increase in the adhesion of cells seeded on ctgf/ccn2-coated wells was observed compared with cells seeded on the bsa-coated control wells . the adhesion was inhibited by the inclusion of edta, and rescued with the addition of mg2+, indicative of the interaction required for ctgf/ccn2-integrin-mediated attachments  <cit> .

to determine if the α6β <dig> integrin complex was involved in the ctgf/ccn2-mediated enhancement of adhesion, the adhesion assay was performed in the presence of function blocking antibodies against both α <dig> and β <dig> integrins. ctgf/ccn <dig> also binds αvβ <dig> so function blocking antibodies against αv and β <dig> integrins were tested as well . the addition of the anti-α <dig> or anti-β <dig> antibodies completely blocked the ctgf/ccn2-mediated increase in adhesion while the addition of the anti-β <dig> showed less inhibition, and the anti-αv or isotype control antibodies showed no significant change in ctgf/ccn2-mediated adhesion. together with the flow cytometry data demonstrating the ctgf/ccn2-mediated enhancement of surface level expression of the α6β <dig> integrin complex, these results confirmed the involvement of the α6β <dig> integrin complex in the ctgf/ccn2-mediated increase in hc <dig> cell adhesion.

ctgf/ccn <dig> expressing cells displayed increased formation of focal adhesions
interactions between mammary epithelial cells and the basement membrane are crucial for survival. to further understand the effects of ctgf/ccn <dig> elevation and stabilization of β <dig> integrin complexes on the formation of focal adhesion complexes, the level and the appearance of focal adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins were analyzed. protein lysates from hc11-tre and hc11-tre-ctgf cells were used for determination of specific protein expression by western blot . results revealed increases in the focal adhesion-associated adaptor and structural proteins in hc11-tre-ctgf cells including paxillin, p130cas, vinculin, parvin, pinch <dig>  and rsu- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, hc11-tre-ctgf cells displayed increases in src but not integrin linked kinase . elevated transcription of collagen, laminin and fibronectin was detected in hc <dig> tre-ctgf cells compared to the tre control cell line  and elevated fibronectin was detected in hc11-tre-ctgf cells by western blot . immunofluorescent staining of the cells with an antibody to vinculin revealed greater focal adhesion formation, both in size and number, in hc11-tre-ctgf cells compared to vector control hc11-tre cells , demonstrating the functionality of ctgf/ccn <dig> on integrin-dependent formation of focal adhesions in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells.

in conclusion, these results indicated that the mechanism by which ctgf/ccn <dig> contributed to lactogenic differentiation was via activation of integrin-mediated adhesion complex, particularly the α6β <dig> complex, which enhanced cell adhesion and survival in hc <dig> cells. this could be attributed to direct binding of ctgf/ccn <dig> to integrin complexes and to ctgf/ccn2-induced laminin and fibronectin expression. both events would be expected to result in elevated integrin expression and functionality. because the engagement of β <dig> integrin is required for the transcription of β-casein and lactogenic differentiation of the mammary gland, these results suggest an important role for ctgf/ccn <dig> in mammary epithelial cell function.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
stromal mediators play a fundamental role in promoting mammary differentiation, and the contact between mammary epithelial cells and components of the basement membrane contributes to the prolactin-induced transcription of milk proteins  <cit> . using the tet-off system for inducible ctgf/ccn <dig> expression in the hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cell background, ctgf/ccn <dig> not only enhanced the early transcription of β-casein in response to lactogenic hormone, but also contributed to the formation of mammospheres, a hallmark of terminal differentiation in these cells. in addition, exogenous ctgf/ccn <dig> enhanced the formation of differentiated mcf10a acini in three dimensional cultures, extending the role of ctgf/ccn <dig> to another culture system which is likely to be structurally and physiologically relevant to the in vivo setting  <cit> . the role of ctgf/ccn <dig> in lactogenic differentiation may depend on its function in the expression and stabilization of matrix-integrin complexes, an activity which promotes prolactin-induced stat <dig> activity.

the data reported here suggest that ctgf/ccn <dig> increased expression of fibronectin and laminin and stabilized the surface expression of the α <dig> and β <dig> integrins. typically, epithelial cells lose their ability to survive in the absence of serum and detach, initiating an apoptotic process called anoikis. however, ctgf/ccn <dig> served as a survival mediator thereby preventing hc <dig> cells from undergoing apoptosis in the absence of serum. the binding of integrins to matrix proteins promotes conformational changes in the extracellular domains of the integrins and a subsequent clustering of integrins in focal adhesions. survival signaling resulting from the formation of focal adhesion complexes involves p130cas, paxillin, ilk, and src  <cit> . the complex is formed after adhesion-induced phosphorylation of fak-y <dig>  recruitment of src causes tyrosine phosphorylation of additional sites on fak, and fak-mediated phosphorylation of p130cas and paxillin  <cit> . fak activation may also contribute to cell survival by direct activation of the p-i- <dig> kinase/akt pathway  <cit> . ctgf/ccn <dig> expression correlated with enhanced expression levels of the major proteins involved in the focal adhesions referred to above, as well as pinch <dig> and rsu- <dig>  which localize to focal adhesion complexes  <cit> . anti-vinculin immunofluorescence visualized larger focal adhesions in ctgf/ccn2-expressing cells compared to control hc <dig> cells. these results confirm a role for ctgf/ccn <dig> in the stabilization of active integrin-mediated complexes and adhesion-activated survival signaling. this is likely linked to the ctgf/ccn2-mediated adhesion signaling via integrins and the activation of akt and expression of bcl-xl. however, hc <dig> cells expressing ctgf/ccn <dig> also exhibited elevated levels of map kinase phosphatase <dig>  , a dual specificity phosphatase frequently induced in response to map kinase signaling. mkp- <dig> dephosphorylates p <dig> kinase, suggesting that preventing the accumulation of phospho-p <dig> may be a contributing mechanism by which ctgf/ccn <dig> inhibits apoptosis.

ctgf/ccn2-mediated activation of β <dig> integrin signaling has been demonstrated in primary skin fibroblasts  <cit>  and activated pancreatic stellate cells  <cit> . in fibroblasts ctgf/ccn <dig> also induced expression of the extracellular matrix proteins laminin, collagen, fibronectin and integrin subunits  <cit> , similar to the increase in these proteins that was observed in the hc <dig> cells engineered to express ctgf/ccn <dig>  the elevated expression of fibronectin and laminin would be expected to the increase integrin engagement and focal adhesion formation. moreover, cyr61/ccn <dig> and nov3/ccn <dig>  highly homologous members of the ccn family, have been shown to bind to and enhance β <dig> integrin-mediated functions in primary skin fibroblasts  <cit> . in our study enhanced integrin-dependent signaling may have resulted from direct interaction between integrins and secreted or cell-bound ctgf/ccn <dig>  as suggested by the integrin blocking antibody data in figure  <dig>  in addition, the elevation of matrix protein expression may have increased rgd-binding integrin engagement in hc <dig> cells and this likely contributed to enhanced proliferation and survival of hc <dig> tre-ctgf cells in the absence of serum. another contribution may result from elevation of syndecan  <dig>  a heparin sulfate proteoglycan, which has been reported to stabilize integrin complexes, including β <dig> integrin complexes  <cit> . syndecan  <dig> upregulation has been observed in ctgf/ccn2-stimulated or -expressing cells  <cit> , and the hc11-tre-ctgf cells also express elevated levels of syndecan  <dig> compared to the hc11-tre vector control cell line .

the association of mammary epithelial cells with laminin is critical for the activation and the nuclear translocation of stat <dig>  <cit> . association of the cells with the matrix proteins occurs through active binding to β <dig> integrin complexes on the cell surface. it is known that binding to laminin via the β <dig> integrin complex  <cit>  is directly associated with the induction of lactogenesis and β-casein transcription  <cit> , although the α integrin has not been definitely identified  <cit> . our data indicate that ctgf/ccn <dig> enhances the expression of laminin resulting in decreased requirement for exogenous laminin in the activation of β-casein transcription, as seen in figure  <dig>  ctgf/ccn <dig> expressing cells did not display the same laminin-dependent increase in the level of β-casein mrna as control cells, suggesting that ctgf/ccn <dig> partially abrogates the requirement for those proteins for the transcription of β-casein. collectively, these results suggest that the mechanism by which ctgf/ccn <dig> enhances lactogenic differentiation is through enhancement and stabilization of the laminin- α6β <dig> integrin cell-matrix interaction that is required early in the lactogenic differentiation process.

the adhesion of epithelial cells to extracellular matrix initiates signaling mechanisms that control cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation throughout the phases of mammary gland development. our finding that ectopic expression of ctgf/ccn <dig> enhanced the growth and survival of hc <dig> cells in vitro supports a proposed role for ctgf/ccn <dig> during late pregnancy and early lactation, a period when ctgf/ccn <dig> levels are elevated in vivo  <cit> . while this study focused on the mechanism of ctgf/ccn <dig> in hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells, ctgf/ccn <dig> also enhanced the transcription of β-casein in primary mouse mammary epithelial cells stimulated to differentiate  <cit> . recent mammary specific knockdown studies ascertained that β <dig> integrin as well as fak and src contribute to the development of the mammary gland and the induction of lactogenesis  <cit> . mammary specific inhibition of β <dig> integrin reduced the activation of the mapk and akt and ultimately resulted in diminished mammary growth and increased mammary developmental defects  <cit> . similarly, a mammary specific knockout of fak caused tissue defects as well as a reduction in milk protein production; this was attributed to a diminished secretory capacity of the epithelium due to the combination of decreased proliferative ability and a lack of stat <dig> activation  <cit> . moreover, a knockout of src blocked lactational ability of the mammary gland although the gland maintained otherwise normal growth  <cit> . based on the results reported here, the effects of a mammary specific knock down of ctgf/ccn <dig> may prove useful in understanding the control of lactogenic differentiation in vivo.
