BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a gram negative, halophilic bacterium that is found in warm marine environments, such as the commensal microflora of shellfish  <cit> . the bacterium is a major food-borne pathogen that causes acute gastroenteritis following consumption of undercooked or raw shellfish, especially oysters. it has become an increasingly important pathogen during the last decade as pandemic strains have emerged, most likely due to rising global temperatures and increased seafood consumption  <cit> . approximately 50% of all cases of food-borne gastroenteritis in southeast asia are due to v. parahaemolyticus. it is one of the major health and economic problems in this region and the incidence of infection is rising throughout the united states, south america and europe  <cit> . the bacterium infects the human intestinal epithelium causing diarrhoea, intestinal inflammation, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, fever, chills and in some cases even death  <cit> . intestinal epithelial responses to v. parahaemolyticus infection include the activation of the inflammatory cascade, infiltration of phagocytes, epithelial cell damage, alterations in the structure and function of the tight junction barrier and the induction of fluid and electrolyte secretion  <cit> .

sequencing of the genome of a pandemic strain of v. parahaemolyticus  in  <dig> revealed the presence of two sets of genes encoding two separate type iii secretion systems, named ttss <dig> and ttss <dig>  <cit> . ttss <dig> is present in all v. parahaemolyticus strains and is involved in host cell cytotoxicity, while ttss <dig> is responsible for enterotoxicity  and is predominantly found in pathogenic strains  <cit> . more recently a third ttss, that is closely related to ttss <dig>  was identified in trh-positive pathogenic strains of v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . ttss effector proteins are injected from the cytosol of bacterium directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell by means of a syringe-like delivery apparatus  <cit> . once inside the host cells the effector proteins modify the activity of eukaryotic cell signalling pathways leading to changes in host cell behaviour that favour the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the host  <cit> .

the mitogen activated protein kinases  are a group of protein serine/threonine kinases that are activated in mammalian cells in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediate signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus where they can alter the phosphorylation status of specific transcription factors  <cit> . three major types of mapk pathways have been reported so far in mammalian cells  <cit> . the erk1/ <dig> pathway is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, whereas the jnk and p <dig> pathways are activated in response to stress stimuli  <cit> . the balance between factors activated by erk, jnk and p <dig> determines whether the cell lives or dies  <cit> . modification of mapk signalling pathways by bacteria may contribute to induction of host cell death, which is an important feature of bacterial pathogenesis promoting bacterial tissue colonisation  <cit> . v. parahaemolyticus induces cell death via ttss <dig> in epithelial cells and macrophages  <cit> . most recently autophagic cell death has been implicated as the mechanism by which v. parahaemolyticus exerts its cytotoxicity  <cit> . the role of mapk in the induction of autophagy and cell death by v. parahaemolyticus has not hitherto been investigated.

the v. parahaemolyticus vopp ttss <dig> effector  has been shown to inhibit mapk signalling pathways in macrophages. it binds directly to mapk kinases , the upstream kinases that phosphorylate the mapk, and both prevents their activation and inhibits their activity. this it accomplishes by acetylating the catalytic loop of mkk, thereby inhibiting atp binding  <cit> . enteric pathogenic bacteria can elicit or suppress expression of cytokines and chemokines from host cells, often via modification of mapk signalling pathways. interleukin  <dig>  is a chemokine secreted basolaterally by epithelial cells thus creating an il- <dig> gradient responsible for migration of neutrophils to the site of infection and is a key player in the initiation of an inflammatory response. the mapk are involved in the signal transduction pathways leading to il- <dig> chemokine production  <cit> . to date there are no published data on the effect of v. parahaemolyticus infection on il- <dig> expression.

employing an in vitro model of intestinal epithelial infection we have found that v. parahaemolyticus induces jnk, erk and p <dig> activation in human epithelial cells and that the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig> mediates the activation of p <dig> and jnk. moreover, the mapk activation within the host cells is associated with the cytotoxic effects exerted by v. parahaemolyticus and with the induction of il- <dig> secretion by the bacterium. the diverse roles of mapk signalling during infection with v. parahaemolyticus indicate that the bacterium may use more than one mechanism to sabotage normal cellular processes and disrupt host response to infection.

RESULTS
v. parahaemolyticus activates the mapk signalling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells
for several pathogenic bacteria modulation of the activity of the mapk signalling pathway is a critical event in their ability to colonise the host  <cit> . the role of mapk signalling during v. parahaemolyticus infection and the ability of the bacteria to modulate host cell responses via this pathway has not been elucidated so far. the first aim of our study was to examine responses of cell signalling mapk to v. parahaemolyticus. caco- <dig> cells were co-incubated with wt rimd <dig> bacteria for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min at an moi of  <dig>  anisomycin was used as a positive control to induce phosphorylation of each of the mapk. heat-killed  wt bacteria were included to investigate the effect of bacterial cell surface moieties on mapk activation, in the absence of active protein synthesis and growth. the extracted proteins were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-jnk, -phospho-p <dig> and -phospho-erk1/ <dig> antibodies. the stripped membranes were re-probed with anti-total-jnk, -p <dig>  -erk1/ <dig> antibody to detect the total level of each mapk protein present in the samples and to control for loading quantities. jnk and p <dig> were phosphorylated in cells co-incubated with the wt bacteria, in comparison to samples obtained from untreated caco- <dig> cells which showed no mapk activation . strong activation of jnk and p <dig> was observed at the  <dig> h time point, but not at earlier time points. in contrast, little or no phosphorylation of jnk and p <dig> was detected in cells incubated for  <dig> h with the heat-killed wt bacteria, indicating that the induction of activation of these two mapk is an active process of v. parahaemolyticus requiring viable bacteria. the patterns of erk activation in response to v. parahaemolyticus were similar with lower phosphorylation signals detected. these studies indicate that v. parahaemolyticus induces activation of the jnk, p <dig> and erk mapk signalling pathways via a mechanism requiring metabolically active bacteria.

ttss <dig> of v. parahaemolyticus is responsible for activation of jnk, p <dig> and erk in epithelial cells
ttss effectors of several pathogenic bacteria have been shown to modify mapk activation levels in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . as v. parahaemolyticus was able to induce phosphorylation of p <dig>  jnk and erk mapk by an active process, we next investigated the involvement of the ttss of v. parahaemolyticus in the activation of these mapk. bacteria lacking a functional ttss <dig> or a functional ttss <dig> were constructed by deleting the corresponding vscn gene for each secretion system. based on homology to other ttss the vscn genes are presumed to encode the atpases that power the secretion process. caco- <dig> cells were co-incubated with wt, Δvscn <dig> and Δvscn <dig> v. parahaemolyticus for  <dig> h and mapk activation analysed by immunoblotting. Δvscn <dig> bacteria induced similar levels of jnk phosphorylation in caco- <dig> cells as those induced by the wt bacteria, when compared to untreated caco- <dig> cells . in contrast the Δvscn <dig> bacteria did not cause an increase in jnk activation, indicating that ttss <dig> is required for the induction of jnk phosphorylation in epithelial cells by v. parahaemolyticus. similarly, p <dig> was phosphorylated to equivalent levels in cells co-incubated with wt and Δvscn <dig> bacteria compared to cells alone. activation of p <dig> was greatly diminished when the caco- <dig> cells were incubated with Δvscn <dig> bacteria showing that the ttss <dig> of v. parahaemolyticus plays an essential role in the activation of p <dig> in epithelial cells in response to infection. conversely ttss <dig> is not required for p <dig> or jnk activation by v. parahaemolyticus. the degree of erk phosphorylation was similar in cells co-incubated with wild-type, Δvscn <dig> and Δvscn <dig> bacteria , although in each case the increase compared to cells alone was less than two-fold. as the increase in activation of erk in caco- <dig> cells was low, the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to induce mapk activation in an alternative human epithelial cell line - hela - was investigated. there was a greater increase in the activation of erk in response to wt bacteria in this cell line as compared to caco- <dig> cells . the requirement for ttss <dig> to activate each mapk was evidenced by the lack of activation seen in response to the Δvscn <dig> strain. these results provide the first evidence that activation of the jnk, p <dig> and erk mapk pathways in human epithelial cells infected with v. parahaemolyticus depends on the bacterium's ttss <dig> 

the ttss1-dependent cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus succeeds mapk activation
it is well known that mapk are activated during cellular stress responses and that they mediate signal transduction events leading to cell death. it has previously been demonstrated that v. parahaemolyticus induces cell death in a ttss1-dependent manner in a variety of cell types, including caco- <dig> cells. to determine whether mapk activation in the caco- <dig> cells is a consequence of the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus we investigated the kinetics of cytotoxicity of the bacterium in these epithelial cells. the caco- <dig> monolayers were co-incubated with wt, Δvscn <dig> and Δvscn <dig> bacteria for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h and cytotoxicity was quantified by measurement of cell lysis  and cellular metabolism/viability . after  <dig> and  <dig> h of incubation there was no significant ldh release  or decrease in cell viability  observed in any of the samples. following  <dig> h of incubation, wt and Δvscn <dig> v. parahaemolyticus induced cell lysis and decreased cell viability of the caco- <dig> cells in comparison to untreated cells. a dramatic increase in cell lysis and decrease in cell viability was observed in the caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with the wt and Δvscn <dig> bacteria at the  <dig> h time point, with more than 80% cell death. in contrast, no significant cell death was detected in samples co-incubated with the Δvscn <dig> v. parahaemolyticus or with heat-killed wt bacteria at any time point and the levels obtained were comparable to the results obtained for untreated caco- <dig> cells. overall the results confirmed that ttss <dig> is required for the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus towards caco- <dig> cells. the ldh and mtt assay results mirrored one another, notwithstanding that mtt measures changes in cell metabolism and as such is a more sensitive reflection of cell pathology than membrane damage. moreover, we have shown that v. parahaemolyticus was cytotoxic to the epithelial cells in a time-dependent manner with no cell lysis occurring at the  <dig> h time point and increasing amounts of cell lysis at the later  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points.

these results prompted us to determine caco- <dig> cell viability using fluorochrome staining . caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with wt, Δvscn <dig> and Δvscn <dig> bacteria were stained with hoechst  <dig> to visualize cell nuclei. propidium iodide was included in the study to visualise dead cells that incorporate the stain due to loss of their membrane integrity. the results revealed that wt v. parahaemolyticus and the ttss deletion mutants did not affect the viability of the caco- <dig> cells during the first  <dig> h of co-incubation. the cytotoxic effect of v. parahaemolyticus infection was observed after  <dig> h of incubation of the caco- <dig> cells with wt and Δvscn <dig>  but not Δvscn <dig>  bacteria confirming that v. parahaemolyticus cytotoxicity is ttss1-dependent.

next we examined the morphological changes induced in epithelial cells by v. parahaemolyticus. figure 3d shows the development of rounded cells after  <dig> h of co-incubation of the caco- <dig> cells with the wt bacteria. after  <dig> h the rounded cells were still present but visible cell loss was also observed because of the cytotoxic effect exerted by v. parahaemolyticus, consistent with the ldh and mtt results. similar to wt bacteria, the Δvscn <dig> mutant induced cell rounding after  <dig> h of co-incubation and cell rounding combined with significant cell loss after  <dig> h. the monolayer of caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with Δvscn <dig> bacteria remained intact and exhibited the morphological features of untreated cells, even after  <dig> h of co-incubation, suggesting that ttss <dig> is required for monolayer disruption and cell rounding and confirming its role in the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus towards epithelial cells.

together these results suggest that the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus is ttss1-dependent and show that this cytotoxic effect occurs after  <dig> h of co-incubation. as strong mapk activation is observed after  <dig> h of co-incubation, we propose that mapk activation is not a consequence of cytotoxicity, but rather it might be a prerequisite for cytotoxicity.

jnk and erk are involved in the ttss1-dependent cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus
as mapk signalling pathways are involved in cell fate determination by co-ordinately regulating a wide range of cellular activities ranging from gene expression, metabolism and motility to mitosis, survival, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> , we next sought to determine whether the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus was a result of mapk activation by the use of mapk inhibitors. sp <dig> is a reversible atp-competitive inhibitor of jnk that prevents the phosphorylation of jnk substrates. in an analogous manner sb <dig> is a specific inhibitor of p <dig> by acting as a competitive inhibitor of atp binding. pd <dig> is a selective inhibitor of mek <dig> activation and the erk cascade, as it binds to the inactive forms of mek <dig> and prevents activation by upstream activators. the concentration of inhibitors that abrogated mapk activity was initially determined by titration experiments with 7-day caco- <dig> cells stimulated with anisomycin. the activation levels of erk, the p <dig> target mk- <dig> and the jnk target c-jun in cell lysates were assessed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. each mapk inhibitor specifically reduced the phosphorylation of its cognate indicator protein . to assess the importance of mapk activation in the cytotoxic ability of v. parahaemolyticus, wt bacteria were co-incubated with caco- <dig> cells in the presence of sb <dig>  sp <dig> or pd <dig> for  <dig> h and then the ldh assay was performed to quantify the level of cell lysis. the inhibitors alone did not affect the viability of the caco- <dig> cells . the jnk and erk inhibitors  caused a decrease in vibrio-induced cell lysis of the caco- <dig> cells. cytotoxicity was reduced by about a third by each of these inhibitors . in contrast, there was no significant difference in the level of cell lysis that occurred in samples incubated with or without the p <dig> inhibitor . addition of both sp <dig> and pd <dig> together during the co-incubation did not decrease cytotoxicity levels below the level seen with either inhibitor alone . the results suggest that activation of jnk and erk, but not p <dig>  is involved in the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to be cytotoxic to the caco- <dig> cells. recently autophagic cell death has been implicated as the mode of ttss1-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . the effect of the mapk inhibitors on the induction of this process by wt v. parahaemolyticus was assessed by visualising monodansylcadaverine  accumulation in autophagic vacuoles. increased mdc accumulation occurred upon co-incubation with wt bacteria  and this accumulation was less evident in the presence of the erk inhibitor pd <dig>  these results indicate that activation of erk by v. parahaemolyticus may influence cytotoxicity at the stage of autophagy induction, while jnk may act at a later stage.

the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig> regulates mapk activation
the results above demonstrated that ttss <dig> was responsible for stimulating the activation of p <dig> and jnk in epithelial cells in response to v. parahaemolyticus. three proteins have so far been identified as ttss <dig> effector proteins, namely vp <dig> , vp <dig>  and vpa <dig> and of these three proteins vp <dig> has been implicated in the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to be cytotoxic to epithelial cells  <cit> . as we had shown a link between the two ttss1-dependent activities of cytotoxicity and mapk activation, the role of vp <dig> in these processes was next investigated. first a strain of v. parahaemolyticus containing a knock-out of the vp <dig> gene was constructed. to authenticate the mutation, the level of cell lysis induced by the Δvp <dig> strain was determined by the ldh assay. over a  <dig> h period the viability of the caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with the Δvp <dig> strain was comparable to the viability of cells co-incubated with the Δvscn <dig> strain  confirming that the vp <dig> ttss <dig> effector protein is the principle factor responsible for the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus towards epithelial cells. analysis of the morphology of the cells co-incubated with the Δvp <dig> bacteria showed that the cells were still attached to the substratum as a confluent monolayer, but appeared rounded and did not display evidence of tight junctions . in contrast cells co-incubated with Δvscn <dig> bacteria were indistinguishable from non-infected cells. this indicated that vp <dig>  <cit>  was being the translocated into host cells by Δvp <dig> bacteria and that ttss <dig> was functional in this strain.

analysis of the ability of this Δvp <dig> strain to induce mapk activation in the caco- <dig> and hela cells was performed by immunoblotting of the extracted proteins with anti-phospho-jnk, -p <dig> and -erk antibodies . in caco- <dig> cells, the Δvp <dig> strain lacked the ability to activate p <dig> and jnk to the extent seen with the wt, indicating that vp <dig> was the ttss <dig> effector required for activation of these two mapk. while reduced erk activation was observed with the Δvp <dig> strain as compared to the wt, a conclusive resolution could not be drawn, due to the low overall fold increase in erk activation. in hela cells a more pronounced decreased phosphorylation of erk occurred in response to Δvp <dig>  in contrast, vp <dig> was only partly responsible for activation of p <dig> and jnk, as just a slight reduction in phosphorylation was seen in cells co-incubated with the v. parahaemolyticus strain lacking this effector as compared to wt bacteria. as activation of the mapk is not abolished when vp <dig> is non-functional, this suggests that there is an alternative ttss <dig> effector that can activate mapk in hela cells, but not in caco- <dig> cells

our results show that vp <dig> is necessary for the activation of jnk and p <dig> in caco- <dig> cells and that jnk is involved in the vp1680-dependent cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus. these data together demonstrate that vp <dig> is required for the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to be cytotoxic to epithelial cells, at least in part through activation of jnk.

both ttss are involved in modulation of il- <dig> secretion by intestinal epithelial cells in response to v. parahaemolyticus
in response to pathogenic bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells produce a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as il- <dig> which attracts neutrophils to the site of infection and can lead to inflammatory responses that may facilitate bacterial infection and colonisation  <cit> . the mapk are key players in the signal transduction pathways that lead to il- <dig> secretion. therefore we tested the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to induce il- <dig> secretion from caco- <dig> cells and investigated the role of the ttss and the mapk in this event. the v. parahaemolyticus strains carrying mutations in each of the two ttss were co-incubated with caco- <dig> cells and the il- <dig> response was measured by rt-pcr and elisa . il-1β was added as a positive control for the induction of il- <dig> secretion. rna extracts were prepared after  <dig> h of co-incubation while the supernatant used for elisa detection of il- <dig> was recovered  <dig> h later.

the rt-pcr results showed that il- <dig> transcription was strongly activated by the il-1β positive control and was induced to a lower extent by wt v. parahaemolyticus, while there was no increase of transcription observed using the heat-killed v. parahaemolyticus . this result shows that live v. parahaemolyticus actively induces il- <dig> transcription. the Δvscn <dig> and Δvp <dig> strains induced similar levels of il- <dig> transcription in the caco- <dig> cells to the wt v. parahaemolyticus, while the Δvscn <dig> strain induced a high level of il- <dig> transcription . this suggests that after  <dig> h of co-incubation ttss <dig> is not involved in il- <dig> mrna production by the caco- <dig> cells, while ttss <dig> is involved in the inhibition of the il- <dig> transcription.

the elisa results show that  <dig> h after co-incubation, wt v. parahaemolyticus is a powerful activator of il- <dig> secretion by caco- <dig> cells, as there was a 15-fold increase in il- <dig> concentrations after wt v. parahaemolyticus co-incubation in comparison to untreated caco- <dig> cells . similar il- <dig> concentrations were detected with the caco- <dig> cells alone and in the presence of heat-killed wt v. parahaemolyticus. a dramatic reduction of il- <dig> secretion was observed in response to Δvscn <dig>  showing an involvement of the ttss <dig> apparatus in the activation of il- <dig> secretion. moreover, the use of the Δvp <dig> strain showed an intermediate level of il- <dig> secretion when compared to the wt and Δvscn <dig> strains, suggesting that the effector protein vp <dig> is involved in the il- <dig> secretion activation by the caco- <dig> cells in response to the bacteria but it is not the only ttss <dig> effector responsible for this activation. with the Δvscn <dig> strain there was a higher level of il- <dig> secretion by the caco- <dig> cells than that observed with the wt v. parahaemolyticus, suggesting that ttss <dig> is involved in the inhibition of the il- <dig> secretion by the caco- <dig> cells in response to the bacteria  <dig> h after the addition of the bacteria.

these results demonstrate that v. parahaemolyticus actively induces the transcription and production of il- <dig> by the host cell. ttss <dig> is involved in the activation of il- <dig> production by the host while ttss <dig> is involved in its inhibition. moreover, we have demonstrated that the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig> is involved in the stimulation of il- <dig> secretion by the host.

the erk signalling pathway is activated by v. parahaemolyticus and leads to il- <dig> secretion by intestinal epithelial cells
in order to obtain a better overview of the signalling pathways leading to il- <dig> activation in response to v. parahaemolyticus, the pharmacologic inhibitors of the mapk signalling pathways were added during co-incubation and il- <dig> secretion was quantified by elisa . addition of the inhibitors sb <dig> and sp <dig> had no influence on the level of il- <dig> secreted by the caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with wt v. parahaemolyticus, while the use of the erk inhibitor pd <dig> led to a significant decrease in the concentration of secreted il- <dig>  in fact a decrease of about 25% was seen in the il- <dig> level secreted by the caco- <dig> cells co-incubated with the wt v. parahaemolyticus when the cells have been pre-treated with pd <dig>  this result suggests that the inhibition of erk signalling leads to inhibition of the resulting il- <dig> secretion level. erk signalling is a major signalling pathway activated by the wt v. parahaemolyticus and leads to the activation of il- <dig> secretion by the eukaryotic cells.

discussion
the results of this study demonstrate that v. parahaemolyticus causes activation of mapk in human intestinal epithelial cells and that this activation is linked to the cellular responses elicited by this bacterium. v. parahaemolyticus induced activation of each of the mapk - jnk, p <dig> and erk - in caco- <dig> and hela cells . a mutant strain with a non-functional ttss <dig>  did not cause mapk activation, providing the first evidence that ttss <dig> is responsible for the activation of mapk in epithelial cells in response to infection with v. parahaemolyticus . while the role of ttss <dig> in erk activation was difficult to observe in caco- <dig> cells, differences in the activation of erk in hela cells co-incubated with wt compared to Δvscn <dig> bacteria were clearly evident. v. parahaemolyticus therefore now joins a select group of gram-negative pathogens that use ttss effectors to activate mapk signalling to promote pathogen infection. given the important role mapk play in controlling host innate immune responses and cell growth, differentiation and death, they are commendable targets for pathogenic effectors. while several pathogens use their ttss to inhibit mapk activation  <cit> , others activate them. for example, the inflammatory responses induced by the ttss effectors of salmonella typhimurium are related to activation of all mapk, especially p <dig> which induces il- <dig> secretion from epithelial cells  <cit> , and burkholderia pseudomallei utilizes its ttss to induce il- <dig> secretion and to increase bacterial internalization via activation of p <dig> and jnk in epithelial cells  <cit> .

several vibrio spp. manipulate mapk signalling pathways to induce host cell death or disturb the host response to infection  <cit> . vibrio vulnificus triggers phosphorylation of p <dig> and erk via reactive oxygen species in peripheral blood mononuclear cells thereby inducing host cell death  <cit> . the ctxb cholera toxin from vibrio cholerae down-regulates p <dig> and jnk activation in macrophages leading to suppression of production of tnfα and other pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . additionally flagellin a from v. cholerae contributes to il- <dig> secretion from epithelial cells through tlr <dig> and activation of p <dig>  erk and jnk  <cit> . despite the fact that v. parahaemolyticus possesses flagellin proteins similar to those of v. cholerae  <cit> , cells co-incubated with heat-killed v. parahaemolyticus did not exhibit mapk phosphorylation , suggesting an absence of tlr <dig> recognition of flagellin. tlr <dig> is activated by dissociated flagellin monomers and the sheathed vibrio flagella present on intact bacteria have a limited ability to trigger host innate immunity  <cit> . in our studies bacteria were washed before addition to the cells and were treated at a temperature unlikely to dissociate flagellin monomers  <cit> , thereby minimising the amounts of flagellin monomers present to trigger tlr <dig> 

the results obtained from ldh assays, mtt assays and fluorochrome staining confirmed that the ttss <dig> of v. parahaemolyticus is essential for the cytotoxicity of this bacterium towards epithelial cells . furthermore these results show that there was no cell death detected prior to the  <dig> h time point, by which time mapk activation was observed. it has been reported that undifferentiated caco- <dig> cells are more susceptible than other cell types  to a ttss2-mediated delayed cytotoxicity  <cit> . while ttss <dig> was required for cytotoxicity during the first  <dig> h of co-incubation, there was little difference in the levels of cytotoxicity observed with Δttss <dig> bacteria compared to wt v. parahaemolyticus when co-incubations were performed for  <dig> h  <cit> . this delayed cell death was attributed to the vopt ttss <dig> effector  <cit> . delayed cytotoxicity was also observed by burdette et al. in hela cells infected with Δttss2/Δvp <dig> bacteria  <cit> . the mechanism of this delayed cytotoxicity is unknown. with extended co-incubations of  <dig> h we too saw delayed ttss1- and vp1680-independent cytotoxicity with differentiated caco- <dig> cells . the delayed cytotoxicity was the not the subject of this study.

the vp <dig> effector protein is responsible for the ttss1-dependent autophagic cytotoxicity against hela cells  <cit> . our results demonstrated that vp <dig> is required for the induction of jnk and p <dig> phosphorylation in caco- <dig> cells  and that jnk and erk, but not p <dig>  are involved in the ttss1-dependent cytotoxicity . each of the  <dig> mapk has been proposed to regulate autophagy and/or autophagic cell death, though the role and relative importance of each one seems to be dependent on cell type and on the induction stimulus  <cit> . the activation of jnk and erk by vp <dig> seems to be important for the cytotoxicity of v. parahaemolyticus towards epithelial cells, whereas phosphorylation of p <dig> by this effector protein plays a different role in modification of host cell behaviour that remains to be defined. in hela cells vp <dig> is responsible for the activation of erk, but plays a lesser role in the activation of jnk and p <dig> than it does in caco- <dig> cells . as activation of all three mapk in hela cells in response to v. parahaemolyticus is ttss1-dependent, but not vp1680-dependent, this points to the existence of an additional mapk-activating ttss <dig> effector that acts in this cell line. since vp <dig> is the principal ttss <dig> effector activating mapk in caco- <dig> cells, this would suggest differing sensitivities of cell lines to the ttss effectors.

the observation that vp <dig> induces phosphorylation of all  <dig> mapk raises the possibility that this protein may not target the mapk directly, but may trigger an upstream kinase. in contrast to vp <dig>  the vopa ttss <dig> effector has been found to inhibit mapk in macrophages by acetylating the upstream mapk kinase   <cit> . it is important to note that the vopa studies were performed with transfected eukaryotic cells that expressed vopa heterologously, whereas the current study assessed mapk activation by intact v. parahaemolyticus. from our studies during co-incubation of v. parahaemolyticus with caco- <dig> cells it appears that the mapk activation of vp <dig> is dominant over the inhibitory effect of vopa. v. parahaemolyticus may co-ordinately regulate both ttss to achieve appropriate control of host responses.

v. parahaemolyticus induced il- <dig> secretion in an active manner as a result of delivery of the ttss effector proteins into host cells . it appears that there may be a balance between ttss <dig> and ttss <dig> of v. parahaemolyticus where ttss <dig> is involved in the activation of il- <dig> production by the host while ttss <dig> is involved in its inhibition. this correlates with the opposing functions of the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig> and the ttss <dig> effector vopa in activating and inhibiting mapk phosphorylation. interestingly, the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig> mutant  induced intermediate amounts of il- <dig>  suggesting an involvement of this protein in stimulating production of this chemokine, but not an absolute requirement . similarly the inhibitory studies revealed that v. parahaemolyticus induces secretion of il- <dig> partly via modulation of the erk signalling pathway . the complex effect of both ttss of v. parahaemolyticus on the host immune defence machinery illustrates the powerful tools the bacteria possess to gain maximum advantage from the host environment.

CONCLUSIONS
a better understanding of the virulence mechanisms of v. parahaemolyticus is imperative for better diagnosis, treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal infections. the findings presented here provide new insights into the roles of ttss <dig> and ttss <dig> in modulating epithelial cell responses to infection. v. parahaemolyticus induced jnk, erk and p <dig> activation in human epithelial cells. ttss <dig>  and the ttss <dig> effector vp <dig>  were of key importance for sabotaging normal mapk cellular processes and disrupting host responses to infection. mapk activation was associated with the cytotoxic effects exerted by the bacterium and with the induction of il- <dig> secretion. the diverse roles of mapk signalling during infection with v. parahaemolyticus indicate it is a significant mechanism to promote virulence.
