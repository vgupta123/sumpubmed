BACKGROUND
culture medium osmolarity is one of the primary parameters that must be considered when formulating an optimized medium for the production of preimplantation embryos. even brief exposure of preimplantation embryos to  <dig> mosm/kg culture media  results in impaired development  <cit> . most mammalian embryo culture media formulations have employed osmolarities around  <dig> mosm/kg. greater culture medium osmolarities may be employed but only in the presence of osmolytes such as glycine, betaine, proline and glutamine  <cit> . preimplantation embryos express a number of transporters that serve to regulate and maintain embryonic cell volume  <cit> . in somatic cell systems, activation of p <dig> mapk is a common response of these osmoregulatory pathways  <cit> .

mapks function by propagating extracellular signals via a series of phosphorylation events through sequentially arranged protein kinases, resulting in cellular responses ranging from transcriptional to post-translational events  <cit> . p <dig> mapk consists of four mammalian isoforms including mapk14/p38α  <cit> , mapk11/p38β  <cit> , mapk12/p38γ  <cit> , and mapk13/p38δ  <cit> . p <dig> mapks are activated by a variety of environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines resulting in phosphorylation of the thr-gly-tyr phosphoacceptor sequence  <cit> . directly upstream of p <dig> mapk, there are at least three dual specificity thr-tyr kinases identified that phosphorylate and activate p38: map2k <dig>   <cit> , map2k <dig>   <cit> , and map2k <dig>   <cit> . downstream substrates of the p <dig> mapks include protein kinases such as mapk-activated protein kinase  <dig>   <cit>  and p <dig> regulated/activated kinase   <cit> , as well as several transcription factors including mef <dig>  chop, and atf <dig>  <cit> .

the discovery of a class of compounds called cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs  has allowed for the specific pharmacological inhibition of mapk14/p38α and mapk11/p38β isoforms  <cit> . the most extensively characterized csaids are the pyridinyl imidazoles sb <dig>  <cit>  and the more potent sb <dig>  <cit> . we have reported that all four p <dig> mapk isoforms are expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development  <cit> . in addition, embryos treated with csaids experience a reversible blockade of development at the 8– <dig> cell stage which is accompanied by a reversible loss of filamentous actin   <cit> . these results point towards an essential role for mapk14/ <dig> in directing development of the mouse embryo past the 8– <dig> cell stage  <cit> .

among its possible roles in the early embryo, p <dig> mapk signaling is likely to mediate embryonic responses to hyperosmotic stimuli. recently, a novel scaffolding protein called osmosensing scaffold for mekk <dig>  was characterized  <cit> . osm binds to f-actin, the gtpase, rac, and the upstream kinases map3k3/mekk <dig> and map2k <dig> in the p <dig> mapk phospho-relay module, recruiting these proteins to sites of active membrane ruffling and newly polymerized actin   <cit> . down-regulation of osm by rna interference demonstrated that map3k <dig> and osm were required for p <dig> mapk activation in response to sorbitol-induced hypertonicity  <cit> . the current mouse gene name for osm is cerebral cavernous malformation  <dig> homolog  .

the present study was conducted to investigate whether ccm <dig> and upstream p <dig> mapk pathway constituents are expressed during preimplantation development and to determine whether changes in ccm <dig> expression are associated with p <dig> mapk activation following exposure of preimplantation embryos to hyperosmotic stimuli. our results indicate that ccm <dig> is expressed throughout mouse preimplantation development and its protein levels are elevated in response to hypertonic culture conditions and correlate with increased p <dig> mapk activity in the early embryo.

RESULTS
detection of mrna transcripts encoding ccm <dig>  map3k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig>  and map2k <dig> during mouse preimplantation development
qualitative rt-pcr methods resulted in the detection of mrna transcripts encoding ccm <dig>  map3k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig> and map2k <dig> producing the expected size amplicons of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively throughout mouse preimplantation development in all  <dig> experimental replicates . the identity of each rt-pcr product was confirmed through direct sequencing and blast® analysis. rt-pcr products amplified using ccm <dig>  map3k <dig>  and map2k <dig> primers possessed 100% sequence identity with their respective genbank® mouse nucleotide sequences. rt-pcr products amplified using map2k <dig> and map2k <dig> primers possessed 98% and 99% sequence identity with their corresponding genbank® mouse nucleotide sequences, respectively.

relative abundance of mrnas encoding ccm <dig>  map3k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig> and mapk <dig> during mouse preimplantation development
ccm <dig>  and map2k <dig>  mrna steady state levels were significantly highest at the blastocyst stage  and did not vary significantly between the morula and 1-cell stages . however, both ccm <dig> and map2k <dig> mrna levels decreased significantly from 1-cell levels to those observed at the 2-cell, 4-cell, and 8-cell stage . map3k <dig>  and map2k <dig>  steady state mrna levels were significantly highest at the morula and blastocyst stages . in contrast, map2k <dig>  steady state mrna levels were highest at the 1-cell stage and declined significantly at the 2-cell stage . map2k <dig> mrna levels then remained low throughout preimplantation development, but did increase significantly  at the morula and blastocyst stages . finally, mapk <dig>  steady state mrna levels were significantly highest  at the blastocyst stage. mapk <dig> mrna levels gradually declined from the 1-cell stage to reach their lowest level at the 8-cell stage before increasing significantly  again at the morula and blastocyst stages.

cellular distribution of ccm <dig>  map3k <dig>  phosphorylated map2k3/map2k <dig> and phosphorylated map2k <dig> proteins during mouse preimplantation development
ccm <dig> immunofluorescence was detected in all stages of early mouse development, from the 1-cell to the blastocyst stage . ccm <dig> was confined to the cytoplasm of each blastomere, where immunofluorescence was detected diffusely throughout. similarly, map3k <dig> immunofluorescence was detected in all preimplantation developmental stages . the diffuse distribution of map3k <dig> immunofluorescence throughout the cytoplasm of each blastomere mirrored the distribution of ccm <dig>  phosphorylated map2k3/map2k <dig>  and phosphorylated map2k <dig>  were also detected throughout preimplantation development. phosphorylated map2k3/map2k <dig> was detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus at all preimplantation stages of mouse development although the nuclear fluorescence was more intense than the cytoplasmic fluorescence. phosphorylated map2k <dig> was primarily confined to the nucleus of each blastomere throughout preimplantation development . in some cases faint phosphorylated-map2k <dig> immunofluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm. this was not consistent and was not restricted to a particular embryo stage . for all proteins these distribution patterns were consistently observed in both trophectoderm and inner cell mass cell types of the blastocyst.

effect of culture in  <dig> mosm hyperosmotic medium on blastocyst morphology and p <dig> mapk activation
we initially employed treatment with high culture osmolarity  to explore the effects of an extreme treatment paradigm on phospho-mapkap <dig> fluorescence. blastocyst culture in ksomaa media containing 10% glycerol or  <dig>  m sucrose resulted in an instantaneous decrease in blastocyst volume. those placed in medium + 10% glycerol displayed a rapid recovery  back to normal volume, however, this recovery was not observed in embryos placed in  <dig>  m sucrose medium . phospho-mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence increased in blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sucrose for  <dig> minutes  or for  <dig> minutes  when compared to blastocysts cultured in ksomaa + 10% glycerol for  <dig> minutes  or  <dig> minutes , or when compared to blastocysts cultured in normal ksomaa control media  for  <dig> minutes  or  <dig> minutes . quantitation of phospho-mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence by scion image analysis demonstrated that  <dig> minutes of culture in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sucrose resulted in a significant increase  in relative signal strength  when compared to normal ksomaa cultured controls and also blastocysts cultured in ksom + 10% glycerol  . the rss of blastocysts cultured in ksomaa + 10% glycerol displayed was not significantly different from normal ksomaa cultured controls . the same outcomes between treatment groups were observed at  <dig> minutes . blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sucrose displayed a significant increase  in rss levels compared to levels obtained for the normal ksomaa cultured controls and blastocysts cultured in ksomaa + 10% glycerol  .

effect of  <dig> mosm hyperosmotic treatment on blastocyst morphology and p <dig> mapk activation
to investigate the effects of reduced levels of hyperosmolarity on phospho-mapkapk <dig> fluorescence we next conducted the following experiment using culture medium adjusted to  <dig> mosm. exposure of cultured blastocysts to a  <dig> % glycerol or  <dig>  m sorbitol medium did not visibly affect blastocyst volume . while no perceptible differences in blastocyst volume were observed between embryos following  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes of  <dig> mosm hyperosmotic treatment, variations in the levels of phospho-mapkapk <dig> fluorescence were detected . following  <dig> minutes of exposure to  <dig> mosm hyperosmotic medium treatments, blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol displayed a significant increase  in rss of phosphorylated mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence  when compared to blastocysts cultured in normal ksomaa culture medium  or ksomaa +  <dig> % glycerol  . the rss of phosphorylated mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence in blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig> % glycerol did not differ from ksomaa only controls . at the  <dig> minute time-point, the rss of blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol was significantly higher  than that observed for blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig> % glycerol and ksomaa only controls  . once again there was no significant difference in the rss displayed by blastocysts cultured in the glycerol medium and normal ksomaa medium controls .

effect of  <dig> mosm hyperosmotic treatment on ccm <dig> transcripts and ccm <dig> protein
to explore a possible mechanism for the induction of p <dig> mapk following incubation in hyperosmotic medium we next examined the influence of exposure to hyperosmotic medium on ccm <dig> expression. we employed the  <dig> mosm culture medium treatment for these experiments since we had now established that this treatment was sufficient to significantly increase phospho-mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence levels. cultured blastocyst stage mouse embryos were exposed to hyperosmotic treatment for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> hours in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol  and compared with cultured blastocysts in normal ksom medium . no significant differences  in relative ccm <dig> mrna transcript levels were observed between blastocysts cultured in the ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol and blastocysts cultured in the normal ksomaa medium control group at any of the investigated time-points . despite this outcome, we next investigated whether ccm <dig> protein levels may be affected. whole-mount immunofluorescence methods employing anti-ccm <dig> antiserum were applied to mouse blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig> % glycerol , ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol , and normal ksomaa medium  for  <dig> minutes . results from the quantification of ccm <dig> immunofluorescence are presented as relative signal strength   . following  <dig> minutes of treatment in  <dig> mosm medium, blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig>  m sorbitol  displayed a significant increase in rss of ccm <dig> immunofluorescence when compared to blastocysts cultured in normal ksomaa medium   or ksomaa containing  <dig> % glycerol    . blastocysts cultured in ksomaa +  <dig> % glycerol did not display a significant difference in rss from blastocysts cultured in normal ksomaa medium .

discussion
our overall objective was to increase our understanding of the intracellular signaling pathways that respond to the external environment and regulate preimplantation development. our recent characterization of the expression of all four isoforms of p <dig> mapk  and a number of its downstream substrates provided the foundation for our current studies  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated a requirement for p <dig> mapk signaling during preimplantation development by characterizing the reversible developmental blockade that occurs at the 8- to 16-cell stage following inhibition of mapk14/p38α and mapk11/p38β isoforms  <cit> . furthermore, p <dig> mapk regulates f-actin polymerization during preimplantation development via phosphorylation of downstream substrates mapkapk <dig> and prak/mapkapk <dig>  and subsequently through the small heat shock proteins, hspb1/ <dig>  <cit> . our present study has extended these initial investigations into p <dig> mapk function during preimplantation development by addressing the upstream events in the three-tiered mapk pathway module. our first objective was to characterize the expression of regulatory kinase gene products upstream of p <dig> mapk during preimplantation development. in this regard we have demonstrated that transcripts and proteins encoding all known mapkks upstream of p <dig> mapk  are present throughout mouse preimplantation development. moreover, we have also identified transcripts and proteins encoding the map3k, map3k <dig>  as well as the novel scaffolding protein, ccm <dig> 

each gene of interest displayed a consistent increase in transcript abundance as embryo development advanced towards the blastocyst stage. there was a significant increase in relative mrna levels from the 8-cell stage to the morula and blastocyst stages for all transcripts investigated. these results suggest that mrnas for p <dig> mapk pathway constituents are rapidly accumulating in the post 8-cell stage embryo and this observation correlates well with outcomes from p <dig> mapk inhibition studies which suggest that p <dig> mapk signaling is required to maintain development beyond the 8– <dig> cell stage  <cit> . of particular note is the nearly 40-fold increase over 1-cell levels in map3k <dig> expression at the morula stage, and the 12-fold increase over the same period in map2k <dig> expression which indicates that map3k <dig> and map2k <dig> may be the primary upstream activators of p <dig> mapk during preimplantation development. conversely, the relatively low expression of map2k <dig> mrna transcripts past the 1-cell stage suggests a reduced role for this kinase during early development. our results indicate that all of these gene products are derived from both oogenetic  and embryonic origins since they are found in both pre- and post-maternal zygotic transition  stage embryos. the predominant pattern observed for transcripts encoding p <dig> mapk upstream regulators was one where mrna levels clearly increased with advancing cleavage stage. this accumulation of mrnas with advancing embryo stage could only occur via contributions from embryonic transcriptional activity.

at the protein level, the ccm <dig> and map3k <dig> cytoplasmic distribution pattern observed following application of whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence was as expected considering the role of ccm <dig> as an actin binding scaffold protein and map3k <dig> as an upstream map3k that is responsive to extracellular stimuli at the cell surface. the diffuse cytoplasmic distribution mirrors the localization pattern displayed by these proteins in hek <dig> and cos <dig> cell lines  <cit> . we also determined the distribution of phosphorylated map2k3/map2k <dig> proteins and map2k <dig> proteins throughout mouse preimplantation development. the use of antisera recognizing the phosphorylated forms of these proteins allowed us to not only characterize their distribution throughout preimplantation development but also report their activation during preimplantation development. activated map2ks were detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of embryos collected from the 1-cell to the blastocyst stage, indicating that the p <dig> mapk pathway is activated from the earliest stages of development onward. while phospho-map2k3/map2k <dig> proteins were detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, phospho-map2k <dig> proteins were confined to the nuclei, suggesting that p <dig> mapk phosphorylation by map2k <dig> may occur predominantly in the nucleus. this nuclear localization is supported by studies that investigated the activation of jnk/sapk in p <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells  <cit> . map2k <dig> was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of differentiated p <dig> cells, but only in the nucleus of undifferentiated p <dig> cells  <cit> . other studies have established that jnk/sapk and map2k <dig> are activated and translocated into the nucleus in response to cellular stress  <cit> . in total, these results establish the presence of all components of the rac-ccm2-map3k3-map2k <dig> signaling complex throughout preimplantation development when coupled with our previous studies that determined rac <dig> expression during mouse preimplantation development   <cit> .

since it is well known that the roles played by p <dig> mapk extend well beyond the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton our present study investigated whether embryonic p <dig> mapk signaling is affected by exposure to hyperosmotic stimuli as is reported for somatic cells. our results clearly demonstrate that hyperosmotic treatment during culture increased p <dig> mapk activity as assessed by increased phosphorylation of its specific downstream substrate, mapkapk <dig>  these findings are supported by numerous studies that have described the responsiveness of this pathway to hyperosmotic stress, and have indicated that increases in p <dig> mapk activity are a common cellular response to hyperosmotic stimuli  and  <dig>  m sorbitol  treatments in which a significant increase in phospho-mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence was detected at two treatment time-points. we propose that this difference in p <dig> mapk activation is a result of the alleviation of osmotic stress and restoration of osmotic equilibrium across the cell membrane due to aquaporin  mediated glycerol permeability. this likelihood is supported by our previous studies which demonstrated the selective permeability of water and glycerol, but not sucrose, through apical and basolateral aqps located in the blastocyst trophectoderm  <cit> . since glycerol can permeate the cell membrane relatively freely via aqps, the initial osmotic gradient  produced by the addition of glycerol to culture media is rapidly reversed in these treatment groups, alleviating "osmotic stress" that might induce p <dig> mapk activity. this also permits the observed re-expansion of blastocyst volume that does not occur with  <dig>  m sucrose treatment  <cit> . the osmotic gradient produced by  <dig>  m sucrose  or  <dig>  m sorbitol  persists for the duration of treatment, enough to induce p <dig> mapk activity. our results may therefore have an impact on studies directed at optimizing embryo cryopreservation protocols as the cyroprotectant used  would be expected to have differential effects on p <dig> mapk activation which may influence embryo survival and recovery post-thaw. investigation of this possibility could result in improved outcomes following embryo cryopreservation.

interestingly, hyperosmotic treatment of cultured rat astrocytes by mannitol or sorbitol increases the expression of aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> mrnas and proteins, which is suppressed by treatment with the p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  <cit> . glycerol treatment, however, had no effect on the expression of these two aqps  <cit> . similar to our study, this was attributed to the absence of an osmotic gradient as a result of glycerol movement across cell membranes. other aqp family members were also differentially expressed in sucrose, sorbitol, or mannitol treatment   <cit> . mouse preimplantation embryos are capable of regulating aqp mrna abundance in response to environmental changes in osmolarity and changes to blastocoel volume following puncture  <cit> , however, the potential role of p <dig> mapk activity in mediating these events was not investigated. based upon our results, we would hypothesize that a prolonged shift in osmotic gradient induces p <dig> mapk activity, which in turn regulates aqp expression as a compensatory mechanism in preimplantation embryos. this would also represent an important direction for future studies to pursue.

by quantifying relative signal strength of phospho-mapkapk <dig> immunofluorescence, we observed a 2-fold increase in p <dig> mapk activity following  <dig>  m sucrose treatment for  <dig> minutes and a  <dig> -fold increase following  <dig>  m sorbitol treatment for  <dig> minutes. a 2-fold increase in p <dig> mapk activity is consistent with results observed in other studies  <cit> . these studies describe rapid  activation of p <dig> mapk in response to hyperosmotic treatment through the addition of various solutes to culture conditions  <cit> . this activation typically reaches peak levels following  <dig> minutes of treatment, but elevated p <dig> mapk activity is sustained for at least  <dig> minutes  <cit> . it should be noted that while the conditions of hyperosmotic treatment and the methods of assessing p <dig> mapk activity vary between these studies, the results are remarkably consistent. tilly et al.,  <cit> described a 2-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of mapkapk <dig> at  <dig> minutes after  <dig> mosm mannitol-induced hyperosmotic treatment in human intestine  <dig> cells  <cit> ; while watts et al. demonstrated in rat medullary thick ascending limb  kidney cells a  <dig> -fold increase in atf- <dig>  phosphorylation with  <dig>  m mannitol following  <dig> minutes treatment  <cit> . furthermore, p <dig> mapk activity peaked at  <dig> minutes of  <dig>  m sucrose treatment in chinese hamster ovary cells  with a 2-fold increase in p <dig> mapk phosphorylation  <cit> . our findings are consistent with these studies since, following peak p <dig> mapk activation, there is a steady decline in activity over time. at both experimental osmolarities employed in our study we detected a decrease in rss  from the first time-point  to the second time-point . other studies have described peak p <dig> mapk activity at approximately  <dig> minutes in response to hyperosmotic stress. this would suggest that the first time-point in our treatments is near peak levels of p <dig> mapk activity, with some of that activity decreased by  <dig> minutes in the preimplantation mouse embryo. the marginal difference in rss between  <dig>  m sucrose  and  <dig>  m sorbitol  is somewhat surprising. one would expect that an  <dig> mosm osmotic gradient would activate p <dig> mapk to a much greater extent than a  <dig> mosm gradient. a possible explanation could be that despite the difference between  <dig> mosm and  <dig> mosm that we may perceive, the embryo may consider both stimuli as equivalent when translating them into responses for activating p <dig> mapk. in this regard it is also possible that  <dig> mosm represents a near-maximal stimulus of p <dig> mapk activation and thus levels beyond this would not result in any further increase in p <dig> mapk activity.

though changes were not detected in localization or steady state mrna transcript levels of ccm <dig> following hyperosmotic treatment, our results did reveal a significant increase in ccm <dig> immunofluorescence in blastocysts treated for  <dig> minutes in  <dig>  m sorbitol , but not  <dig> % glycerol . these results suggest a solute specificity in the induction of ccm <dig>  which agrees with the induction of p <dig> mapk activity and phosphorylation of mapkapk <dig> described above. uhlik et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the specificity of osm/ccm <dig> to hyperosmolar stimuli by comparing sorbitol and anisomycin treatment, however alternative means of varying treatment osmolarity  were not attempted in this study. interestingly, the  <dig> -fold increase in ccm <dig> immunofluorescence we observed mirrored the  <dig> -fold increase in p <dig> mapk activity assessed by mapkapk <dig> phosphorylation. uhlik et al. reported a  <dig> -fold increase in mekk <dig> kinase activity in hek <dig> cells treated with  <dig>  m sorbitol for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . the kinetics of hyperosmolarity-induced map3k <dig> activation reported in that study closely mirrored that of endogenous p <dig> mapk activation in the hek <dig> cells. an increase in detectable ccn <dig> protein without an increase in mrna levels suggests that  <dig>  m sorbitol treatment increases ccm <dig> expression at the translational level, requiring de novo protein synthesis. an alternative explanation for this increase in detectable ccm <dig> protein may be in the regulation of scaffold protein stability. if  <dig>  m sorbitol treatment results in the increased binding of ccm <dig> protein with its scaffolding partners, it could result in decreased proteolysis and degradation of ccm <dig> protein. this would explain the significantly elevated rss of ccm <dig> immunofluorescence detected in the sorbitol-treated blastocysts when compared with glycerol-treated and control blastocysts. either of these possibilities would require further study, as very little is currently known about the translational regulation of ccm <dig> protein, nor is it clear how ccm2-p <dig> mapk interactions may be regulated in general. while our study has presented a novel discovery in the induction of ccm <dig> in response to hyperosmotic treatment of preimplantation embryos, much work remains to fully characterize ccm <dig> activity and regulation during this period of development.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that transcripts and polypeptides encoding map3k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig>  map2k <dig> and ccm <dig> are expressed and localized throughout mouse preimplantation development. we have discovered that p <dig> mapk activity is regulated by exposure to hyperosmotic stimuli, and that the response to hyperosmotic stress in the early embryo includes increased ccm <dig> levels. these outcomes provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms controlling osmotic induction of p <dig> mapk activity during preimplantation development. the outcomes therefore further our knowledge of the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways within the mammalian embryo and understanding of how culture environments can affect embryo development. the preimplantation embryo is highly sensitive to the environment in which it develops. with the extension of embryo culture to the blastocyst stage emerging as a routine treatment paradigm in human infertility clinics, it becomes even more important that we study the short-term and long-term effects of culture on embryo development. our results may therefore contribute to advancements in the development of improved embryo culture systems with the ultimate goal of increasing our ability to produce healthy embryos for embryo transfer.
