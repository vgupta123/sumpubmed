BACKGROUND
an essential part of discourse comprehension is building cohesive links between sentences and sentence fragments. pronouns are devices with which these cohesive links can be established. because pronouns normally refer back to an element earlier mentioned in the sentence representing the same entity, a coreferential relationship has to be established between the pronoun and the antecedent. this is not a trivial process and consists of determination, activation and interpretation of the antecedent as well as integrating the pronoun itself into the sentence structure built up so far  <cit> . the studies presented in this paper address both processes. more specifically, the influence of gender congruency between the pronoun and the antecedent on the establishment of the coreferential relationship will be investigated, as well as the influence of a local structural case constraint on the pronoun , using event related brain potentials.

psycholinguistic research of the last two decades revealed that on-line pronoun resolution may draw on diverse sources including discourse and pragmatic information, syntactic processes and syntactic constraints as well as lexical/semantic phenomena . these claims are based on different methodologies varying from questionnaires, self-paced reading studies  to cross-modal priming and event-related brain potential measurements. this might be one reason for the diverging results. there is, however, some consensus that the resolution process is facilitated if certain constraints are met  <cit> . it seems obvious that gender information plays a major role in the resolution process of personal pronouns referring to male or female persons . according to generative grammar rules pronouns have the same index as the antecedent  <cit> , thus inheriting the gender , and number  characteristics of the antecedent. hence, the pronoun and the antecedent agree in number and gender. this helps to determine the antecedent and facilitates the comprehension process  <cit> . although agreement constraints are induced by grammatical rules, they clearly reflect certain semantic/conceptual characteristics as well .

recently, event related brain potentials  have been used to investigate pronoun resolution. erps provide information about the time-course of brain activity related to pronoun processing without introducing an extra unrelated task  <cit> . erps are multidimensional in nature. because of the high temporal resolution they have been proven to be extremely useful determine the time course of different ongoing processes in language comprehension. in contrast to overt responses that are usually obtained with some delay and possible contamination by decision related processes, erp effects  are an immediate expression of the functional changes of the brain which can be measured in parallel with the comprehension processes. effects are described that primarily index the processing of semantic/conceptual information and syntactic information. an enhanced negative effect with a peak around  <dig> ms post-stimulus largest over central and right posterior electrode sites is found for difficulties related to semantic integration processes  as well as for discourse integration  <cit> . in relation to syntactic processing a late positivity with an onset of approximately  <dig> ms with a maximum at  <dig> ms after onset of the critical word at centroparietal sites has been reported . the problems that elicit this late positivity vary from syntactic violations such as agreement violations  <cit> , phrase structure violations  <cit>  as well as reanalysis of a garden-path sentences or processes involved in computing a less-preferred structure in local structure ambiguity resolution  <cit>  and structure complexity  <cit> . in terms of its functional interpretation, the p <dig> has been viewed to reflect syntactic processing difficulty of different varieties, such as the inability of the parser to assign the preferred structure to the incoming words  <cit> , syntactic reanalysis  <cit> , or syntactic integration difficulty  <cit> . it has to be noted, however, that a purely syntactic interpretation of the p <dig> has been challenged by findings of p <dig> effects to semantic anomalies  <cit> .

other erp-experiments reported a left anterior negativity  being elicited by syntactic anomalies such as morphosyntactic violations  <cit>  subcategorisation violations  <cit> , and phrase structure violations  <cit> . alternatively, lan-effects have also been found for words that induce a larger memory load, either because of the lexical characteristics or  syntactic factors such as the triggering extra parsing steps  <cit> .

to investigate whether number and gender mismatch between a pronoun and its antecedent is primarily a syntactic problem or a semantic problem, osterhout and mobley  <cit>  registered erps during the processing of sentences in which the congruency of number or gender of a reflexive pronoun was manipulated  and  respectively).

b. the successful woman congratulated herself/himself* on the promotion.

considering the syntactic rules , one can claim that the incongruent pronouns violate syntactic constraints. alternatively, the incongruency can be regarded as a discrepancy of meaning of conceptual characteristics for number  as in , and for biological gender characteristics  as in .

erps showed an enlarged widely distributed p <dig> in the absence of an n <dig> for both incongruent conditions . thus, the authors concluded that pronoun violations in number and gender are encountered as a syntactic or structure building problem rather than a semantic or meaning problem. in a second experiment in which personal pronouns were used , gender mismatch also elicited an enlarged p <dig>  but only when subjects judged such sentences to be unacceptable. n <dig> effects were found in sentences with semantic anomalous words . the effects were replicated in a third experiment in which number agreement of reflexive pronouns and verbs were manipulated as well as semantic anomalous words were used. in a further study osterhout, bersick and mclaughlin  <cit>  investigated the influence of stereotypical gender match between reflexive pronouns and the antecedent, as in the surgeon prepared himselfmatch/herselfmismatchfor the operation. a surgeon is stereotypically male and reflexive pronouns that did not match with the probable gender of the antecedent elicited a late positivity similar to the p <dig> .

our own group used german sentences in which the biological and/or syntactic gender of the pronoun was manipulated in combination with a non-diminutive or a diminutive antecedent  <cit> . in this situation, the type of antecedent influenced what kind of processes were involved. whereas a biological gender violation between the pronoun and the non-diminutive antecedent resulted in an n <dig>  no such effect was found for the sentences with a diminutive antecedent. both, sentences with diminutive and non-diminutive antecedents with a syntactic gender violation caused a p <dig>  which was more broadly distributed if the antecedent was a diminutive noun phrase and the pronoun was syntactically and biologically incongruent. the results indicate that for non-diminutives, both syntactic and conceptual information is used to establish coreference, while for diminutives the process might be more syntactically driven.

most erp studies focussed mainly on the coreferential relationship between the pronoun and the antecedent by manipulating the congruency in gender and/or number between the antecedent and the pronoun often resulting in either a violation or a less preferred disjoint coreferential relationship with a possible antecedent outside the available context  <cit> . there are however some studies that investigated pronoun resolution in relation to certain structural preferences in a wider discourse, e.g. by manipulating the distance between the pronoun and the antecedent  <cit> , or structure parallelism  <cit> . it might therefore be argued that the use of violations in psycholinguistic erp-paradigms is problematic, because the brain's handling of violations might well be different from the processing of correct items. to address the specific research question raised in the current paper, the violation approach is without alternative, however. in addition, it should be pointed out that during the natural use of language, violations can occur and may even be unavoidable. a case in point is our previous study of diminutives  <cit> . as diminutives denoting persons in german are assigned neuter gender , pronominal referral to such diminutive nouns entails either a syntactic  or a conceptual  violation.

two erp-reading studies, one in german and one in dutch, are presented in this paper. in german and dutch different overtly case-marked pronouns are used to refer to male and female persons. furthermore, in a prepositional phrase, it is the preposition that assigns case to the pronoun. thus, one can manipulate biological/syntactic gender  features separately from case-marking  features. in german, prepositions that assign either accusative or dative case were used, such that the accusative case  was violated using dative case  and vice versa. in dutch, however, prepositions assign object-case without differentiating between accusative and dative. therefore, in the dutch version of the experiment object-case  was violated using nominative case . gender agreement was manipulated by presenting a female personal pronoun if the possible antecedent, i.e. the subject of the main clause, was male and vice versa. in table  <dig> examples of sentences from all conditions are given in german and dutch. by systematically combining pronouns with the same  or different  gender as the antecedent with either correct  or incorrect  case assigned to the pronoun by the preposition in a prepositional phrase, four condition were created: correct case and gender ; incorrect case and congruent gender ; correct case and incongruent gender ; incorrect case and incongruent gender .

based on the results of the study of coulson et al.  <cit>  a lan in combination with a p <dig> can be expected for the sentences with a case violation  in comparison to the correct sentence , whereas based on our previous work an n400-p <dig> combination can be expected for the sentences with a gender mismatch  <cit> .

RESULTS
results: german experiment
on average, subjects answered  <dig> % of the yes/no questions correctly  indicating no problems in understanding the sentences.

the grand average erps, time-locked to the onset of the critical pronoun are shown in figure  <dig> .

brain responses to conditions with either incorrect case or incongruent gender were different from those in the correct condition in two ways. for the condition with incongruent gender only  a negativity can be noticed starting approximately at  <dig> ms after onset of the pronoun in comparison to the correct condition . this deflection is broadly distributed and has a duration of approximately  <dig> ms . it is isolated by the computation of difference waves  which form the basis of the topographic maps shown in figure  <dig> . the centroparietal maximum suggests that this effect is an instance of the n <dig>  the  condition shows a similar  negativity. from  <dig> ms onwards erps from all incorrect conditions showed a positive shift relative to the c+g+ condition, which has a parietal maximum qualifying this effect as a p <dig> .

to quantify the negativity mean amplitudes in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms time-window were obtained. this window was defined by visual inspection of the effect in the grand average erp signal and falls within the standard n <dig> time window . an omnibus repeated measures anova that crossed the factors 'condition'  and 'electrode sites'  showed main effects of condition  =  <dig> ; p ≤ .006) and electrode sites  =  <dig> ; p ≤ .0001), but no significant interaction. planned pair-wise comparisons computed for cz, as the effect was largest at that site, showed that the amplitude of the negativity of the -condition was significantly larger in comparison to conditions with congruent gender  . there was no significant difference in the n <dig> time range between congruent gender conditions . although a negativity is apparent in the erp-waveform for the incorrect case and incongruent gender condition  in comparison to the congruent gender conditions , the corresponding comparisons did not reach significance .

for the p <dig>  mean amplitude values were analysed for a time window of  <dig> to  <dig> ms. the respective omnibus anova revealed main effects of condition  =  <dig> , p ≤ .0001) and electrode sites  =  <dig> , p ≤ .004) as well as an interaction between electrode sites and condition f =  <dig> , p ≤ .0004).

to assess for amplitude differences of the p <dig>  this global analysis was followed up by planned pair-wise comparison between conditions computed for data from the medial parietal site , where the p <dig> is maximal  .

discussion: german experiment
two clear electrophysiological effects were present in the german data set: a relatively early negativity between  <dig> – and  <dig> ms, and a late positivity between  <dig> and  <dig> ms. the negativity was found for the gender incongruent/case correct  condition, with a similar, smaller and statistically non-significant effect present for the double violation condition . this negativity had a distribution similar to the "classical" n <dig> , which is known to reflect problems of semantic integration. we take this as evidence that the processing of an incongruent gender pronoun causes problems of semantic/discourse integration. it is important to note, that in the current stimulus material biological/conceptual and syntactic gender of the antecedent coincided and were jointly violated. the processing system in this case seems to use the biological  gender information in its attempt to establish a coreferential relationship: because of the gender incongruency in the c+g- items it is not possible to build up a coreferential relationship between the pronoun and the only available possible antecedent in the discourse. the resulting integration problems cause an n400-effect.

why, then, is there a smaller negativity for the c-g-condition? it seems that under these conditions the processes involved to resolve the incorrect case assignment  suppress attempts at lexical integration. the fact that the c-g- condition showed the largest p <dig> effect in the later time window raises the alternative possibility that the lack of an n <dig> effect might be due to an overlap with an enlarged positivity. we do not think that this is the case, because such an overlap effect would have led to differences in distribution of the p <dig> effect between the conditions. the p <dig> showed a similar distribution in the other two incongruent conditions , however. finding a positivity for all three conditions indicates that both gender congruency and the violation of a local structural constraint disrupt pronoun resolution. we will return to the functional interpretation of this effect in the general discussion.

results: dutch experiment
subjects' answers to the yes/no questions were correct in  <dig> % . thus, subjects had no problems in understanding the sentences. grand average erps are shown in figure  <dig> . as in the german study, the erps in the c+g- condition were associated with a negativity in the  <dig> to  <dig> ms range followed by a positive shift .

the two conditions involving case incongruities  were associated with a positive shift as well. in this case, however, the erps to the incorrect conditions started to diverge from the erps in the correct condition as early as  <dig> ms.

to quantify these differences, mean amplitudes in the 280– <dig> ms time range were obtained. this window was defined based on prior erp experiments investigating pronoun resolution that had revealed a negativity in this time range  <cit> . the time-window was corroborated by visual inspection as well as by calculating the onset and ending of the divergence using pair wise comparisons between the correct condition and the correct case incongruent gender condition  in consecutive windows of  <dig> ms each  on fz, cz and pz separately. the first window started at the onset of the pronoun; the next window moved  <dig> ms  and therefore overlapping  <dig> ms  with the previous window. to minimize the danger of false positives, the  <dig> ms windows were only considered significant when three successive windows showed these effects , resulting in the above-mentioned time frame of 280– <dig> ms after pronoun onset.

this window overlaps with the window in which the negativity was found in the german study. the omnibus repeated measures anova for this 280– <dig> time range showed a main effect of condition  ≤ .0061), as well as an interaction of electrode sites × condition  ≤ .0188). planned pair-wise comparisons at the cz electrode, near the maximum of the negativity, revealed that the negativity seen in the c+g- condition was significant in comparison to the other three conditions. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig>  the c-g- and c-g+ conditions showed an early positivity relative to the correct condition  upon visual inspection, which was partially confirmed by the pair-wise comparisons .

as in the german study, the negativity found for the correct case incongruent gender condition  was followed by a positive shift. the isovoltage maps show that the positivity in the conditions in which case is violated  has a centroparietal maximum, thus resembling a p <dig> . to evaluate this effect mean amplitudes  were entered into an omnibus anova, which showed main effects of condition  =  <dig> , p ≤ .002) and electrode sites  =  <dig> , p ≤ .001) as well as an condition × electrode sites interaction  =  <dig> , p ≤ .02). this was followed up by pair-wise comparisons at pz, where the effect was maximal . a significant difference was found between the correct condition  and each of the other conditions.

discussion: dutch experiment
as in the german study, the negativity of the c+g-condition clearly resembles an n <dig> thus indicating problems with the integration of semantic/discourse information. finding a negativity for the condition in which gender only was violated and a positive shift for the conditions with a case violation clearly indicates different underlying processes in pronoun comprehension of either a mismatch in gender between the pronoun and the antecedent and/or incorrect case marking.

the particular case violation used in the dutch study is obviously detected as early as  <dig> ms after the information becomes available. this is the same moment at which the semantic/discourse integration problems in the c+g- condition are apparent. similar early positivities have been reported in several studies in which the processing of less preferred structures over highly preferred structures was investigated  showed a late positive shift broadly distributed over the scalp. as in the german study, this indicates that both gender congruency and correctness in case marking affects pronoun resolution in this later time frame probably involving the final structure building of the sentence.

in summary, the dutch study showed that gender information not only affect semantic/discourse integration processes, but also effect later processes that are merely syntactic in nature. case information influences the pronoun resolution as early as the lexical/discourse integration problems elicited by the gender incongruency become apparent. additionally gender incongruency as well as the violation of the case assignment by the preposition influences later processes possibly related to the final structure building process.

discussion
the electrophysiological effects found in the german and the dutch study provide evidence that in both languages semantic and syntactic gender information is used during pronoun resolution, and that the pronoun resolution is influenced by the case assignment under preposition governing. as expected, in both studies an n400-p <dig> complex was observed, corroborating earlier findings of schmitt et al.  <cit>  that both, syntactic and semantic integration processes play a role during pronoun processing. the n <dig> was found for the condition with a gender incongruency only , indicating a problem of semantic/discourse integration whenever there is a gender mismatch between the pronoun and the only possible available antecedent which makes it impossible to build up a coreferential relationship. in addition, a p <dig> was found in both studies in all incongruent conditions compared to the c+g+ condition. with regard to the p <dig> in the c+g-, it is clear that this positivity is the final consequence of the gender mismatch. it is not possible to conclude whether the p <dig> is a reflection of the coindexing problem or rather driven by problems to build the most preferred final structure, namely a structure in which a coreferential relationship between the pronoun and the antecedent is established. an interpretation of the processes underlying the p <dig>  which seems to fit the current set of data quite well, has been given recently by hagoort in the context of his memory, unification, and control -model of language  <cit> . in his interpretation, hagoort is drawing heavily from the 'unification model', a computational model formulated by vosse and kempen  <cit> . the key concept of this model is that each word in the lexicon is associated with a structural frame that specifies the possible structural environment of this particular word. in the process of sentence comprehension, the syntactic frames are unified into a structural representation of the whole sentence by the formation of 'unification links'. specifically, hagoort proposes that the p <dig> latency should be related to the time needed to establish unification links of sufficient strength. "the time it takes to build up the unification links until the required strength is reached, is affected by ongoing competition between alternative unification options , by syntactic complexity, and by semantic influences." the amplitude of the p <dig> on the other hand is thought to vary as a function of the amount of competition, which should be reduced when the number of alternative unification options is smaller, or when lexical, semantic or discourse information biases unification in a particular direction. in this framework, the greater p <dig> amplitude in the c-g- condition  in the german study could be attributed to the fact that in this condition the strength of the unification process is not only affected by the gender incongruency, but also by the case violation, causing unsuccessful unification attempts.

although the gender manipulation in the german and dutch study was identical, a different case manipulation was used due to the differences in the case marking system of personal pronouns of the two languages. it turns out that the one remarkable difference between the two current experiments mainly concerns those conditions in which case assignment was violated. in the german study accusative case was violated by wrongly assigning dative case and vice versa, whereas in the dutch study object case was substituted by nominative case . in the dutch study, the positivities found for the conditions in which incorrect case was assigned  started as early as  <dig> ms after the onset of the pronoun, whereas in the german study the onset latency was approximately  <dig> ms. it thus appears that the nominative case violation is more salient than the accusative/dative case violation, because the nominative case in dutch  is not morphologically marked, whereas object case in dutch and accusative and dative case in german are. this probably makes the nominative violation easier recognizable, and thus, affects the onset of the involved processes. in addition, nominative case cannot be assigned under governing of a preposition, whereas dative and accusative case both are. thus in case of a nominative pronoun, it clearly is the incorrect marking of the pronoun that causes the violation. in german however, although the incorrect marking becomes available at the pronoun, it can also be that the proceeding preposition is the actual item that does not fit, especially since there are prepositions that do assign the case of the actually form of the pronoun.

both the saliency of the nominative case in a prepositional phrase in comparison to the case marked accusative/dative case marked pronoun in german, and the possible dual cause of the violation in the german study  influence the number of alternative unification options and the timing of these operations. this, then, might explain the latency difference of the positivities in the two studies.

it should be pointed out that hagoort's muc framework delivers just one of several competing accounts of the processes underlying the p <dig>  it provides, however, a useful explanation as to why the double violation condition  gives rise to a greater p <dig>  a monitoring perspective as taken by van herten et al.  <cit>  might handle our set of data equally well. these authors propose that after encountering an unexpected linguistic event, the reader reattends the unexpected unit to check upon its veridicality. a linguistic event can be unexpected for several reasons and the degree of expectedness is reflected in the characteristics of the p <dig> 

the differences in amplitude and onset of the p <dig> found in the two current studies are harder to accommodate by accounts envisioning the p <dig> as a reflex of purely syntactic integration difficulty  <cit>  or syntactic reanalysis  <cit> .

although for both studies not only an n <dig> effect and a p <dig> was predicted, but also a lan, no evidence was found for such an effect. in comparison to english, the language used in most other erp studies investigating pronoun resolution, dutch and german have a relatively free word order, whereas english has not  <cit> . as argued before, language specific characteristics can cause differences in parsing and comprehension processes. what is more, in the studies reported in this paper, there was one and only one possible antecedent, and the pronoun received case from the preposition in the prepositional phrase. by contrast, coulson et al.  <cit>  not only used pronouns that do not need an antecedent that is actually mentioned in the discourse , they also manipulated possessive pronouns following a transitive verb that could not take a person as a second argument, as was illustrated in example  <dig>  given the presence of a possible antecedent and a third person pronoun in the present study, the differences between the effects found in the current study and the study of coulson et al. might be explained by the differences in pronoun resolution. whereas in the current study it is very likely that an attempt is made to establish a coreferential relation ship between the pronoun and the antecedent given in the preceding context, this is not the case for a first or second person pronoun as used by coulson et al.

to summarize, in german and dutch not only gender information affects the resolution of a pronoun, but also local structural constraints  influence the parsing process. the differences in the characteristics of the effects indicate that case information influences processes merely syntactic in nature, whereas gender information also affects semantic/discourse integration processes. evidence was found that a combination of incorrect case assignment with a gender incongruency affect the resolution processes as early as  <dig> ms, and involves more processing activity than a pronoun of which only one source of information is violated or incongruent. additionally it was argued that the features of the case violation in combination with language specific characteristics play an important role in the onset and nature of the processes involved in pronoun resolution.

CONCLUSIONS
to the extent that the assignment of semantic and syntactic processes to erp negativities  and positivities  is valid, the presence of both effects in conditions with a gender violation indicates that pronoun resolution with gender incongruency between the pronoun and the antecedent results in semantic as well as syntactic integration problems. violations in the sense of incorrect case marking without a gender violation give rise to syntactic but not semantic integration problems as attested by the presence of a positivity. both case and gender information appear to be used as they come available.
