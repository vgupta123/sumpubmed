BACKGROUND
in north america, lyme disease  in dogs is caused by borrelia burgdorferi  sensu stricto a tick-borne spirochete. a diagnosis of ld is made based on an assessment of tick exposure risk, clinical signs consistent with disease, serological testing, differential diagnosis and response to antimicrobial therapy  <cit> . clinical signs of ld are generally non-descript in dogs, but may include fever, arthritis, anorexia, lymphadenopathy and glomerulonephritis  <cit> . however, the majority of dogs sero-positive to bb do not show clinical signs of the disease  <cit> . there are no approved antimicrobials for the treatment of ld in dogs and because it is difficult to induce clinical disease in dogs by experimental infection, the optimal use of available antibiotics and duration of treatment are unknown  <cit> . not only do opinions vary on how to treat dogs, but also on whether or not to treat sero-positive, but asymptomatic dogs. additionally, all currently recommended treatments require frequent and prolonged antibiotic administration which makes owner non-compliance with the full dosing regimen a concern  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to compare the outcome of treatment of beagles experimentally infected with bb with cefovecin, a novel long-acting cephalosporin  <cit> , administered as two subcutaneous injections 14 days apart to the recommended daily administration of doxycycline or amoxicillin for 31 days  <cit> . in this study we used an “early” ld model that is based on histopathological changes in joint synovial tissues . this model consistently and reliably produces joint lesions which precede the development of ld induce lameness. the united states department of agriculture  center for veterinary biologics  has accepted this early ld model as the primary variable in support of label claims against subclinical arthritis associated with ld for vaccine registration purposes . clinical signs, serological responses and the presence or absence of borrelia spirochete dna in skin biopsies were also measured to provide broad and clinically relevant measurements of response to treatment.

RESULTS
cefovecin in vitro growth inhibition of spirochetes
cefovecin at a high concentration of  <dig> ug/ml eliminates borrelia burgdorferi strain b <dig> by 24– <dig> h in bsk-h culture at 34c, and  <dig>  ug/ml of cefovecin retards spirochete growth by at least 30 % in 54 h . data from this limited initial probe study bracket the mic of cefovecin against a high pass b. burgdorferi lab strain.fig.  <dig> cefovecin in vitro growth inhibition of bb viability. bb viability in the presence of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> ug/ml cefovecin was determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 54 h by counting motile spirochetes in ten random field-of-views  using phase contrast microscopy. each dose was assessed in triplicate and the mean calculated; error bars represent the standard error of the mean , when error bars are not shown the sem is smaller than the symbols



detection of spirochete dna in skin biopsies
polymerase chain reaction  amplification of the borrelia flab gene confirmed the successful infection of dogs with spirochetes from the wild caught ticks by day  <dig>  with  <dig> out of  <dig> dogs having detectable borrelia dna in their skin biopsies. this ratio continued to increase in untreated dogs through day  <dig>  with  <dig> out of  <dig> dogs becoming positive, but declined thereafter to become negative for all untreated dogs by day  <dig>  none of the treated animals remained pcr positive after treatment with doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefovecin started on day  <dig>  this difference in frequency was significant between the untreated controls and the treated groups on day  <dig> only. no significant differences were observed between the pcr results of any of the antibiotic treatment groups.

clinical signs
for three weeks after tick challenge body temperatures were measured daily in all dogs. five to eight dogs in each group had pyrexia  at least one time during that period, but all dogs remained bright and alert. only one dog from the untreated group was lame on day  <dig> and one dog from the doxycycline-treated group was lame on day  <dig> 

serological responses to infection and treatment
prior to tick infestation  all dogs were serologically negative for bb-specific antibodies using several independent assays . by day  <dig>  i.e., prior to treatment, 5– <dig> animals in each group had become snap positive . the dogs continued to sero-convert even after treatment with the highest number of snap positive dogs observed on day  <dig>  about 15 weeks after the start of tick infestation and 5 weeks after the start of antimicrobial treatments. subsequently the numbers of snap sero-positive dogs in the treated groups declined to zero by day  <dig> or around 21 weeks after the start of the treatment. in contrast, in the untreated control group only 2– <dig> dogs became sero-negative on any given sampling day for the remainder of the study. the difference in the number of snap positive dogs between untreated and treated animals was significant on day  <dig> for the cefovecin group only. by day  <dig>  however, all antibiotic treated groups had significantly less sero-positive dogs than the untreated control group. also, on day  <dig> the cefovecin group had significantly fewer dogs positive than the doxycycline group. at no other time was a significant difference observed between any of the antibiotic treatments used in the number of snap positive dogs.fig.  <dig> number of bb sero-positive treated and untreated dogs using different antigens and diagnostic platforms. the number of sero-positive dogs in each of  <dig> treatment groups  using  <dig> routinely used commercial assays at different times after infections and treatments. statistical analysis was only possible after day  <dig>  because of housing restrictions. statistical difference of a treatment group from untreated animals is designated by d , a  and c 



antibody values using the quant c <dig> assays followed a similar pattern as the snap test and many animals passed the sero-positive cut-off limits by day  <dig> . in contrast to the snap test, however, all treated animals became quant c <dig> negative by day  <dig>  irrespective of the antibiotic used. this difference in frequency was significant on all subsequent sampling days, except on day  <dig> when only  <dig> untreated animals were sero-positive.

antibody values in the lyme multiplex assay reflect the different expression stages of the surface antigens used. ospa, an antigen expressed in the tick vector, only stimulated an early and transient serological response below the positive cut-off level and differences were not detected in any of the samples . ospc, expressed during transmission of the pathogen from the tick vector to the mammalian host, generated a serological response early in the infection, but only in half of the animals. the antibodies to ospc subsequently declined in all animals, including those in the untreated control group . no significant differences were observed between any of the groups at any time point. by contrast, antibodies to ospf appeared later in the infection, peaking around day  <dig> in the untreated controls, and only declined upon treatment . by day  <dig>  all animals in the cefovecin treated group had already become negative for ospf antibodies, which was significantly lower than the untreated control group with only  <dig> negative animals. at the next sampling point all amoxicillin and doxycycline treated animals also became negative for ospf antibodies, while the number of sero-negative untreated controls remained significantly lower for the rest of the trial with only  <dig> out of  <dig> animals.

histopathological evaluation of skin and joint synovial tissues
the number of dogs, per treatment group, identified with lesions consistent with ld is shown in fig.  <dig>  histological sections of healthy skin and joint tissue , as well as lesions typical associated with ld  found in untreated dogs are show in fig.  <dig>  these lesions are characterized by inflammation of the perivascular and perineural tissue in the skin and by nodular inflammation composed mainly by lymphocytes and plasma cells in the joint capsules. when considering any lesion as possibly associated with ld,  <dig> out of  <dig> control dogs were considered affected, while the doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefovecin treated groups only had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> affected animals, respectively . this reduction in affected animals, when compared to the untreated controls, was only significant in the cefovecin treated group. when only taking into account those animals that had at least  <dig> tissues affected with ld associated lesions, as a means to remove normal background changes in the joints, both doxycycline and the cefovecin treated groups achieved significance when compared to the untreated controls . the amoxicillin treated group never achieved a significant reduction in the number of affected animals when compared to the controls, nor was any significant difference observed between any of the treatment groups.fig.  <dig> number of dogs with lesions associated with lyme disease. the number dogs with any lesions associated with ld in tissue samples from the joint capsule or synovium from left and right shoulder, elbow, carpus, stifle, and tarsus of each dog or dogs with lesions in more than  <dig> tissues was determined in each treatment group on day  <dig>  *statistically different treated dogs from untreated animals

discussion
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of cefovecin against early ld in an experimental model using wild caught ticks. while the presence of other pathogens cannot be excluded in these wild caught ticks, the presence of b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, general considered as the causative agent of ld, was confirmed in both ticks and dogs. screening mic data for a number of leptospira species and a small pilot study conducted at zoetis suggested that cefovecin at the fda registered dose  and interval  would be effective. to bridge the current results to previous studies  <cit>  and to compare cefovecin to the antibiotics currently considered the standard of care  <cit>  we also included doxycycline and amoxicillin treatments in this study.

given that predictably eliciting overt clinical disease, such as lameness, in dogs in an experimental model has eluded researchers to date  <cit> , we relied in this study on evaluating the presence or absence of the pathogens using pcr amplification of borrelia dna in skin biopsies, serological responses and histopathological changes in skin and joint tissue to test the effectiveness of the antibiotics.

as observed previously, very few dogs in this study developed clinical signs associated with ld. only two dogs became transiently lame: one dog from the untreated group on day  <dig> post bb exposure and one dog 189 days after treatment with doxycycline. the lack of overt clinical signs occurred despite successfully infecting all  <dig> dogs as evidenced by the presence of bb-specific antibodies in at least one serological test  or a positive pcr from skin biopsies. review of the individual histopathology results in the two dogs with lameness revealed that only  <dig> of  <dig> joints examined, the right stifle and the left tarsus, had any lesions compatible with those described for ld in the doxycycline treated dog, with all lesions characterized as mild. however, the untreated control dog had lesions compatible with those described for ld in  <dig> out of  <dig> joints examined, with lesions in  <dig> of these joints; the right carpus, the left shoulder, and the left and right tarsus; characterized as moderate to marked in severity.

similar serological responses to infection and treatment were observed across all diagnostic platforms and antigens used. differences observed are associated with the change in expression of antigens by the borrelia spirochetes as they transition from the tick vector to the mammalian host and subsequently adapt to the host and its mounting immune response  <cit> . as such antibodies to ospc, a surface antigen associated with the initial invasion of the dogs, appear early in the infection only and antibody values drop typically by 6– <dig> weeks post infection  <cit> . treatment in this study started on day  <dig> post tick exposure. as expected, antibodies to ospc subsequently increased after infection and had started to drop in all groups, including the untreated control group by the next sampling time point on day  <dig> post infection. ospc is therefore an excellent marker for early or recent infection, but on its own is not suited to measure the response to treatment that is applied as late into infection as in this study. by contrast, both the c <dig> and ospf antigens are expressed during later infection and appear to be good markers to measure treatment success . antibodies to both markers remain relatively high and above the sero-positive cut-off limits in many untreated control animals for at least 300 days after infection. in contrast, the antibiotic treated groups no longer had substantial antibodies circulating to these antigens within 70 days of antibiotic treatment. while the pathogenesis and the role of circulating antibodies of ld associated protein-losing nephropathy remains unclear  the significant reduction in circulating antibodies to bb antigens might provide clinical benefits  <cit>  and is considered an indicator of a reduced bacterial burden.

inflammation in the synovium or in joint capsules along with hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the synovial layer has been observed in dogs diagnosed with experimental ld and these lesions are considered to be precursors to the lameness typically associated with the infection  <cit> . in this study the cefovecin-treated group had the fewest number of dogs with lesions and this number was significantly lower than the untreated controls. given that both doxycycline and amoxicillin are generally considered as efficacious against borrelia  <cit>  and given the relatively small number of dogs per group, it is not surprising that no significant difference was observed between any of the antibiotic treatment groups. while it is encouraging that even 225 days after the last cefovecin treatment significantly less treated animals had joint lesions associated with ld, this study did not assess the longer term benefits of treatment. in previous studies borrelia antibodies rose again 150– <dig> days after a 30 day treatment with amoxicillin or doxycycline  <cit> , suggesting that the infection had not been eliminated from the animals and that the possibility of clinical and pathological relapse remained. while we did not observe such rise in this study, we cannot exclude that longer observations or immune-suppression with corticosteroids  <cit>  might be necessary to determine whether or not the pathogens were eliminated from the animals or not.

CONCLUSIONS
cefovecin administered as two subcutaneous injections at 8 mg/kg body weight 14 days apart provided a significant and sustained reduction in the numbers of dogs with joint lesions and circulating antibodies associated with ld infection. this outcome was comparable to that observed with 31 days of daily oral doxycycline or amoxicillin administration.
