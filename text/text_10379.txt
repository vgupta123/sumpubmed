BACKGROUND
the cytoplasmic rig-i-like receptors  provide the first line of defense against virus infection  <cit> . they recognize rna species harboring 5′-triphosphate or diphosphate ends and/or double-stranded features ppdsrna)  that are physiologically absent from the cytosol . the highly conserved rlr family  <cit>  comprises three members: rig-i; mda5; and lgp <dig>  rig-i and mda <dig> detect virus infection and induce an interferon  response, whereas lgp <dig> acts as a regulator of rig-i/mda5-mediated activation . rig-i and mda <dig> are composed of amino-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains , a central helicase domain  and a c-terminal domain  . rig-i or mda <dig> cards, which are released upon cognate rna binding, mediate signal transduction by interacting with the card of the membrane-bound mitochondrial antiviral signaling  adaptor . indeed, rna-bound rig-i  <cit>  or mda <dig>  <cit>  activate mavs by promoting its multimerization through multiple, mixed card-card interactions. multimerized mavs acts as a central node to recruit the kinases responsible for converting several latent transactivators of cytokines including type i and iii ifn genes. the minimal rna required to activate rig-i appears to be short 5′ppdsrna  leading initially to monomeric rna-rig-i complexes , which can then multimerize by k63-linked polyubiquitin chain-mediated interaction between the exposed cards  <cit> . in the case of mda <dig>  the transduction unit is a multimer formed by the co-operative head-to-tail binding of mda <dig> monomers along a > <dig> – <dig> kb dsrna  <cit> .fig.  <dig> refinement of rig-i hel residues involved in hel2i-card <dig> interaction and rna binding as assessed by rig-i ability to activate the human ifnβ-promoter in huh <dig>  cells. a modular domain organization of rig-i and location of amino acid substitution investigated in this study. hel motifs involved in atp binding or rna binding are represented in blue and red, respectively, and in violet when involved in both of them. b functional investigation in huh <dig>  cells of hel2i residues contacting card <dig> f <dig> residue in rig-i auto-repressed form and hel1/hel2i residues involved in rna binding without rna , or stimulated with 5′pppdsrna  or poly . data  were expressed in fold response of wt rig-i with poly set up as  <dig> % activity. see additional file  <dig> for protein expression levels of each construct analyzed by western blot. card: caspase activation and recruitment domain; hel: helicase



sf <dig> helicase/atpase family members, including rlrs, are characterized by the coupling of nucleic acid and atp binding to a conformational switch which, in turn, can trigger various downstream functions  <cit> . at the same time, nucleic acid binding results in the allosteric activation of the atpase. the sensitivity, duration and reversibility of the switch is controlled by the kinetics of ligand binding, the atpase activity and eventual downstream effector interactions. in the case of rig-i and mda <dig>  evolution has fine-tuned these receptors to exclusively detect and robustly respond to only the tiny subset of foreign rna species that harbor a particular molecular pattern amongst the sea of cellular self rna. exactly how this is achieved is incompletely understood and is the subject of this study. the central sf <dig> hel domain comprises two reca-like domains , with a helical insertion domain  located at the beginning of hel <dig> and a pincer domain in elbow, the latter two being specific to the rlr family . structural and biochemical studies of rig-i and mda <dig> proteins have revealed the canonical roles of the conserved motifs ia-ic, iia  and iv-v  in the interaction with double-stranded rna  and q, i , ia, ii , iii  and vi  in the atp binding and atp hydrolysis . according to several structural and biochemical studies, ligand-free rig-i binds atp poorly  <cit> . the atpase activity of rig-i and mda <dig> is stimulated only in the presence of bound dsrna ligands  <cit> , since the accurate positioning of key residues responsible for atp hydrolysis depends on conformational changes induced by rna binding  <cit> . furthermore, dsrna has only restricted access to rig-i hel. indeed, the multipartite dsrna binding site on hel  is kept in a flexible open conformation and is partially hidden by the interaction of card <dig> with hel2i that maintains rig-i in an auto-repressed conformation  <cit> . accordingly, the affinity of a card-deleted rig-i construct for 5′pppdsrna increases by four-fold  <cit> . the high affinity of rig-i ctd for 5′ppdsrna  ensures its specific and efficient capture . as a result, the dsrna moiety can compete efficiently with card <dig> for cis-binding to the hel domain. this results in hel wrapping around the dsrna in a closed conformation that is stabilized by atp binding  <cit> . indeed, while the isolated rig-i hel has no/low atpase activity even in the presence of rna  <cit> , the hel-ctd fragment exhibits strong atpase activity  <cit>  thanks to the primary binding of the cognate rna to the ctd  <cit> .

mda <dig> shares with rig-i a very similar structure of the hel domain and ctd  <cit> . however, the recruitment of its dsrna agonist is unlikely to result from a primary capture mediated by its ctd since mda <dig> ctd only has a very weak affinity to dsrna   <cit> . mda <dig> hel has a slightly higher affinity , whereas the affinity rises by five-fold for full-length mda <dig>   <cit> . notably, the cooperative binding of mda <dig> on longer dsrna increases its affinity  <cit> . in cells, mda <dig> is activated mostly, if not only, by > <dig> kb long viral dsrna  <cit> , higher-order viral rna structures  <cit>  or > <dig>  kb of the synthetic dsrna mimic poly  <cit> . the differently orientated ctd of mda <dig> binds to both the hel-bound dsrna and hel2i  <cit> , while hel2i of one monomer binds to the pincer domain of the next monomer according to a model of the head-to tail oligomer  <cit> . the structure of the inactive state of mda <dig> is unknown.

the atpase activity of rig-i and mda <dig> appears to have a central physiological role since atpase defective and gain-of-function mda <dig> and rig-i alleles are associated with either improved viral clearance  <cit>  or autoimmune diseases . furthermore, mutations disrupting the atpase activity of both rig-i  <cit>  and mda <dig>  <cit>  can be associated with loss- or gain-of-function. however, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms remain puzzling. from experiments using a rig-i construct lacking cards  interacting with a short 5′pppdsrna and atp, a rapid on/off binding cycle of 1– <dig> s duration was interpreted as reflecting atp-hydrolysis protein translocation along the dsrna  <cit> . translocation of rig-i, dependent on its atpase activity, has also been invoked to explain oligomerization of rig-i on longer 5′pppdsrnas  <cit> . in the case of mda <dig>  atp hydrolysis has been shown to drive the dissociation of mda <dig> from dsrna, thus controlling the efficiency of the nucleation process leading to self-oligomerization on dsrna  <cit> . as a result, binding to short dsrna is kinetically unstable explaining why mda <dig> is activated only by > <dig> – <dig> kb long dsrna  <cit> .

in this work, we further investigate the phenotype of rig-i and mda <dig> molecules harboring substitutions disrupting either the card2-hel2i interaction, the rna binding or the atpase activity alone or in combination. this allows us to demonstrate, for the first time, that all atpase-deficient rig-i and mda <dig> receptors that are constitutively active rely on an intact rna binding capability of their hel domain. altogether our data led us to propose a model of rig-i and mda <dig> activation from auto-repressed forms in which the atpase activity allows both helicases to kinetically discriminate invading non-self rna from the cellular self rna.

RESULTS
functional study of rig-i card2
in the absence of an agonist rna, rig-i is in an inactive auto-repressed state due to the binding of card <dig> to hel2i that also hinders dsrna binding to the hel  <cit> . accordingly, when overexpressed in huh <dig>  cells, which are intrinsically deficient in rig-i, mda <dig> and the response to type i ifn , wt rig-i was unable to activate the human ifnβ promoter . previously we reported that the mutation f539d leads to constitutive rig-i activity consistent with this hel2i residue being key in mediating the sequestration of the cards according to the crystal structure of full-length duck rig-i  <cit> . here, again based on the crystal structure, we designed an additional three human rig-i mutants, this time on the card <dig> side of the card-hel2i interface. all three mutants, rig-i_card, rig-i_card, rig-i_card, were found to be inactive despite being well-expressed . since we expected these mutants would mirror the f539d mutation and also exhibit constitutive activity, their loss-of-function phenotype suggests that the cards bearing these combined mutations are unable to transduce the activation signal to mavs. the single rig-i_card substitution exhibited a  <dig> % reduction in its ability to activate the ifnβ promoter upon rna stimulation after poly or a 61-mer-5′pppdsrna stimulation. this is in contrast to the previously reported loss of constitutive activity of isolated rig-i cards carrying the same p112a mutation  <cit> . interestingly, when the p112a constructs were expressed in 293t cells, which is endowed with a minimal functional rlr and ifn response, they exhibited a significantly higher constitutive activity over that observed with wt rig-i . this suggests that despite being inherently less efficient  and unable to be activated by cognate rna, , those mutants could directly or indirectly stimulate an endogenous rlr response, the underlying mechanisms of which remain unclear.

further insights in rna binding sites of rig-i hel domain
within the helicase iia motif, q <dig> is a phosphate binding site for the 5′ strand of dsrna  <cit> . the q380p substitution was introduced into the hel <dig> subdomain of wt rig-i. rig-i q380p did not elicit signal transduction upon stimulation with poly or 5′pppdsrna . the combined k508a, q511a, v514a and k518a substitutions in the hel2i subdomain interface with the dsrna ligand could also abolish the recognition of poly and 5′pppdsrna in huh <dig>  cells , a phenotype that was also observed in 293t cells . the comparison of rig-i hel-ctd/rna  and mda <dig> hel-ctd/rna   <cit>  structures suggested to us that hel <dig> residues 666– <dig> of hrig-i, a partially ordered loop in most crystal structures, may contact the 5′ppp end of dsrna. additional file  <dig> shows that this is not the case since substitution of this  <dig> aa long loop by the corresponding  <dig> aa long loop from mda <dig> or lgp <dig>  or by an unrelated sequence sgsgss, hardly affected the stimulation by 5′pppdsrna or poly.

the constitutively active rig-i e373q atpase mutant relies on both hel and ctd rna binding sites
to evaluate the role of the atpase activity of rig-i in its ability to transduce a signal in cellula, the functional impact of substitutions in the helicase motifs i, ii and iii was studied . the k270a  mutant, which abrogates atp binding  <cit> , exhibited a significant residual response to the stimulation by 5′pppdsrna or poly. this response was abrogated when k270a was associated with mutations previously reported to reduce the rna binding capability of either the hel or the ctd domains, that is, by introducing the hel t697a/e702a substitutions  <cit>  , or the ctd k888a/k907a substitutions  <cit>   . in contrast to k270a, we found that the e373q  mutant displayed a significant and reproducible constitutive activity  and could be further activated by both dsrnas. when associated to hel°, e373q became inactive as does wt rig-i. when associated to ctd°, e373q exhibited a response profile similar to that of its wt counterpart, namely, no constitutive activity and significantly reduced response to both dsrnas . the t409s/s411a  atpase mutation  resulted in a limited response profile with no constitutive activity and a low response to both rnas of similar magnitude to those observed with wt-ctd° and e373q-ctd°. when ts/aa was combined with hel° the response to either dsrna disappeared . importantly, the phenotype of e373q was distinct from that of the constitutively active f539d mutant  <cit> . indeed, f539d remained active even when associated with either ctd° or hel° indicating a destabilization of the auto-repressed state of rig-i. this destabilization, however, is not complete  since a cognate rna induced an additional signal to the f539d constitutive activity that was annihilated when this substitution was associated with either ctd° or hel° rna binding mutants. similar results were obtained when working with 293t as host cells .fig.  <dig> interplay between the atpase activity and rna binding sites of rig-i to elicit a signal. the ability of wt, hel2i f539d, atpase e373q, k270a and t409a/s411a  mutants rig-i harboring or not mutations that loosen the rna binding sites on the hel  or ctd  domain were tested for their ability to activate the human ifnβ promoter. note lower signalling ability of the f539d-ctd° mutant correlates with its lower expression as determined by western blot . the activity of f539d and e373q was constitutive at p < <dig>  and p < <dig> , respectively. all atpase variants with intact hel and ctd domains significantly responded to both 5′pppdsrna and poly with the possible exception of ts/aa variant stimulated by the 5′pppdsrna . the wt, k270a, e373q and ts/aa ctd° variants lost their response to 5′pppdsrna , and also to the poly in the case of k270a mutant . e373q-hel° was inactive  as were all hel° constructs . the constitutive activity of the f539d mutant  remained unaffected when associated to either ctd° or hel° if the lower protein expression level of f539d-ctd° construct is taken into account. the significant response of f539d construct to both dsrnas  was abolished if associated with hel° or ctd°. note the log scale display of the ifnβ activation because values were within a large range. see additional file  <dig> for protein expression levels of each construct analyzed by western blot. ctd: c-terminal domain; hel: helicase



the constitutive activity of mda <dig> atpase mutants relies on an intact hel rna binding site
as quoted above, the ectopic expression of hmda <dig>  resulted in a significant activation of the human ifnβ promoter , and the response could be significantly enhanced by stimulation with phi <dig> dsrna or poly , a finding also illustrated in additional file 5a. all the individual k335a, e444q, t488a/s490a  and g821s substitutions located in the atpase resulted in a strong constitutive activity far exceeding the response of wt mda <dig> to dsrna stimulation , with e444q displaying the highest and g821s the lowest activity, respectively . none of the atpase mutants exhibited an additional response to phi <dig> dsrna or poly. the constitutive activity of these mutants was maintained when associated to ctd° , showing that an intact rna binding site on the ctd was not required. in contrast, altering the rna binding site on mda <dig> hel  reduced the activity to the background level observed with wt mda <dig>  although partially obscured by the presence of endogenous rlr and response to interferon, similar results were obtained with wt and e444q mutant in 293t host cells .fig.  <dig> interplay between the atpase activity and rna binding sites of mda <dig> to elicit a signal. a schematic domain organization of human mda <dig>  b ability of mda <dig> atpase mutants to activate the ifnβ promoter in huh <dig>  cells. expression of mda <dig> activates the ifn promoter . compared to wt, atpase variants with intact rna binding sites exhibit a constitutive activity . in contrast, the wt-ctd° and wt-hel° constructs, which have an altered rna binding site due to r728a and h927a substitution, respectively, do not respond to both dsrnas. the association of ctd° reduces the constitutive activity of only g821s , with g821s-ctd° exhibiting a residual response to both dsrnas , p < <dig> ). hel° inhibits both constitutive and rna-dependent activities  down to the background activation level of ifnβ promoter observed with wt mda <dig> . c inhibition of constitutive activity of every atpase mutant by mev v  and mev v-stop , but not by mev v-e235a . mev v-stop had higher inhibitory effect than mev v . in the presence of poly, the profile of inhibition of wt and e444q mda <dig> activity by mev v and v-stop was similar . in panel , e444q displayed the strongest constitutive activity , and k335a, ts/aa and g821s shared a similar constitutive activity. d ie/kr substitution alone significantly reduced observed responses of all constructs . as observed in panel  the introduction of hel° abolished both the response to dsrna and constitutive activity of mda <dig> variants . upon stimulation with phi <dig> and poly, both wt and e444q mda <dig> with ie/kr substitution retained a significant activity , with a significantly higher response to poly than to phi <dig> . see additional file  <dig> for protein expression levels of each construct analyzed by western blot. ctd: c-terminal domain; hel: helicase; mev: measles virus



the constitutive activity of mda <dig> atpase mutants is disrupted by v protein and relies on mda <dig> self-oligomerization
paramyxovirus v protein binds tightly to the hel <dig> domain of mda <dig>  <cit> , inducing a steric clash with the bound dsrna , and inhibiting mda <dig> function  <cit> . accordingly, all mda <dig> atpase mutants lost most of their constitutive activity in the presence of measles virus v . similar results were obtained with a c-terminally truncated v protein  that lacks the riwy motif that has been described to inhibit positive regulation of mda <dig> signal transduction by the pp1α/γ phosphatases  <cit>  . in fact, mev v-stop exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on both the constitutive activity of atpase mutants and on dsrna-induced activation of wt mda <dig>  as a control, v-e235a, which is deficient in binding to mda <dig>  <cit>  , showed a minimal inhibitory effect, as expected.

when the e444q mutation was combined with i841k/e842r  substitutions that disrupt dsrna driven mda <dig> self-assembly  <cit> , the constitutive activity was drastically reduced indicating the requirement of an intact mda <dig> self-oligomerization process. however, both wt and e444q mda <dig> with ie/kr substitution retained a small but significant response to the stimulation with phi <dig> and poly . the use of 293t cells instead of huh <dig>  cells resulted in similar phenotype ranking .

dech/dqch mutation in the atpase results in reduced kinetics of atp hydrolysis
we further studied the dech to dqch mutants, since the isolated e/q mutation in the dead motif of another helicase/atpase, vasa, exhibited only very slow atp hydrolysis and product release, allowing trapping of bound rna  <cit> . indeed both purified duck rig-i  and chicken mda <dig>  e/q mutant hydrolyzed atp much slower than their wild-type counterparts. moreover, this decrease in atpase efficiency was not accompanied by a measurable change in the affinity for dsrna as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay  . furthermore, deleting the cards from mda5-e444q resulted in a ten-fold increase in the hydrolysis slope . this suggests a more stable access of the dsrna in the absence of the cards since dsrna/hel-ctd complex formation was quantitatively indistinguishable in emsa . interestingly, emsa of mda <dig> hel-ctd constructs showed three species of shifted bands that might correspond to the formation of monomers and oligomers, such supershifting being not observed with full-length mda <dig> .fig.  <dig> dech/dqch mutation in atpase domain of a

in the absence of the ctd, rig-i remains auto-repressed due to the pincer, while mda <dig> remains inactive even when the pincer and the last β-strand of its hel domain are deleted
as reported previously  <cit> , rig-i with a c-terminal truncation in the pincer-ctd linker to remove the ctd domain  is unable to be activated by poly . when a similar truncation is made to hmda <dig>  the resulting card-hel construct  displayed only the background activity observed with the ectopic expression of full-length mda <dig>  and was not activated by poly . this suggests that, as for rig-i, mda <dig> card-hel is maintained in an auto-repressed form. correlatively, the card-hel with e/q mutation from both rig-i and mda <dig> do not exhibit any constitutive activity as their wild-type counterparts and in marked contrast with their full-length counterparts .fig.  <dig> ctd deletion of both rig-i and mda <dig> locked them in an auto-repressed form which is alleviated by deletion of the pincer domain in the case of rig-i. a card-hel, rig-i 1– <dig> and mda <dig> 1– <dig>  and card-hel° constructs and their dqch mutant display only background activity similar to their full-length  counterparts and do not respond to poly. note by comparison the significant albeit reduced response to poly of full-length rig-i and mda <dig> with ctd° unable to bind rna  when compared to ctd° without poly, and p < <dig>  and p < <dig>  when compared to wt constructs + poly, respectively, consistently with data shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  b further deletion of the pincer domain alone, rig-i 1– <dig> quoted Δ, or together with deletion of the last hel <dig> βsheet, rig-i 1– <dig> quoted Δ, results in constitutive activity of rig-i . in contrast, their mda <dig> counterparts mda <dig> 1– <dig> quoted Δ and mda <dig> 1– <dig> quoted Δ, shows no enhancement over the background activity exhibited by mda <dig> hel and hel° constructs . free cards from both rig-i  and mda <dig>  are constitutively active . note that the lower basal activity  of mda <dig> Δ construct is associated with a lower expression level. card: caspase activation and recruitment domain; ctd: c-terminal domain; hel: helicase



from the rig-i and mda <dig> crystal structures, the pincer domain likely contributes to maintaining the architecture of the hel domain in addition to its role in allosteric stabilization of the atpase core  <cit> . we thus questioned its role in maintaining rig-i and mda <dig> in their auto-repressed and inactive forms, respectively. indeed, further truncation of rig-i card-hel from the pincer domain alone , or together with the deletion of the last β-strand of hel <dig> , resulted in strong constitutive activity albeit lower than that observed with the cards alone . surprisingly, similarly truncated mda <dig> constructs  did not exhibit activity above the basal background observed with full-length mda <dig>  suggesting that the mda <dig> pincer is not required in maintaining its inactive state. isolated cards from both rig-i  and mda <dig>  exhibited, as expected, a constitutive activity . these particular phenotypes of rig-i and mda <dig> truncated constructs were also observed in 293t cells .

discussion
card sequestering by the hel domain as a common feature for auto-repressed forms of rig-i and mda5
despite intensive investigations, the mechanism of rig-i and mda <dig> activation remains only partly understood. the structure of ligand-free full-length and card-hel rig-i reveals an auto-repressed state with the card <dig> domain bound to the hel2i subdomain  <cit> . this interaction is further supported by the  <dig> μm affinity measured between the isolated card and hel domains  <cit> . this binding involves a hydrophobic network between card <dig> p <dig>  t <dig>  m <dig> and l <dig>  and hel2i f <dig>  <cit> . that this network drives the exposure of cards and signal transduction is supported by the constitutive phenotype of the f539d mutant even when associated to the hel° or ctd° domain that are deficient in rna binding. the converse mutation of multiple card <dig> residues that include m <dig> results in inactive rig-i. m <dig> is located at the rig-i card2/mavs card interface in the crystal structure of chimeric constructs  <cit> , suggesting that these mutants are inactive because they cannot interact correctly with mavs despite the cards being released. this further supports, as we previously suggested  <cit> , that the card <dig> surface involved in the recruitment of the signaling effectors is inaccessible in the auto-repressed form of rig-i, thus ensuring a strict dichotomy between the ‘off’ and ‘on’ activation state. the card-hel domain is also auto-repressed showing that the ctd is not required to maintain this state  <cit>  . on the contrary, the pincer domain is required to maintain the auto-repressed state since upon its deletion, card-hel become constitutively active, a finding that was initially misinterpreted as indicative of ctd bearing a repressor activity when testing the truncated rig-i 1– <dig>   <cit> .

in the case of mda <dig>  the facts that the card-hel construct has a minimal level of constitutive activity identical to that observed with full-length mda <dig> and that isolated cards are constitutively active  <cit>   suggest that, in the resting state, mda <dig> might also adopt an auto-repressed state with the cards sequestered. contrary to rig-i, the pincer domain does not appear to be involved in maintaining this state. the ten-fold higher atpase activity of mda5-e444q construct lacking the cards  further suggests a competition between dsrna and cards for binding to the hel domain as it is the case for rig-i. likewise, the formation of mda <dig> oligomers suggested by supershifted bands in the absence of cards  compared to full-length  argues that the cards may mask mda <dig> self-oligomerization sites. how mda <dig> hel domain maintains the cards in an inactive state is unknown but it appears to be less robust than for rig-i, since biochemical studies have failed to detect either the binding between bacterially expressed mda <dig> cards and hel  <cit>  or contact surfaces that would be protected from deuterium exchange  <cit> . interestingly, the card <dig> surface involved in recruiting the signaling effectors has a similar location in rig-i and mda <dig>  <cit> . importantly, the ctd of both rig-i and mda <dig> appears to be essential in alleviating their auto-repressed/inactive forms since card-hel constructs lacking the ctd lose their ability to be activated by their cognate rna.

multiplicity of critical rna binding sites of rig-i hel domain
in accordance with the canonical functions of the various conserved helicase motifs  <cit>  and the footprint spanning 9– <dig> bp of dsrna according to crystal structures  <cit> , the sf <dig> helicase family conserved motifs primarily involved in rna binding are motifs ia  <cit> , ib and ic  <cit> , iia , iv  <cit>  and v  <cit> . consequently, critical residues for dsrna recognition in cellula appear widely distributed all over the hel domain as functionally demonstrated with q <dig> , q <dig>  k <dig>  q <dig>  v <dig> and k <dig> , the participation of which is cumulative as shown by the partial reduction of dsrna recognition exhibited by individual substitution of q511a  <cit>  or combination of only some of them , and t697/d <dig>   <cit> . a series of crystal structures shows the hel2i residues k <dig> and q <dig> contacting several different base pairs along the dsrna, which has been interpreted to reflect a sequential scanning movement of the hel2i domain along a 10-mer dsrna  <cit> . overall, the successful recognition of 5′pppdsrna bound to rig-i ctd by the hel domain relies on a network of critical residues ideally arranged to support a reciprocal allosteric control with atp fixation and hydrolysis.

the key result from our work is the demonstration that the constitutive activity of rig-i atpase mutants is dependent on an intact rna binding ability. this suggests that this constitutive activity is stimulated by the binding of cell-intrinsic rnas and that the atpase activity is required to avoid self-activation of rig-i. from the available information including our present work, we propose the following model of rig-i recognition of a cognate rna leading to signal transduction . in the resting state, rig-i is kept in an auto-repressed form with card <dig> binding to hel2i that impedes direct access of rna to the hel domain, a state apparently stabilized by the pincer domain. upon viral infection, rig-i ctd selectively traps non-self 5′pppdsrna ectopically present in the cytosol with high affinity  . this favors the cis-binding of the dsrna moiety to the hel domain favoring the co-operative binding of atp  <cit>  . atp fixation together with rna binding stabilize the closed conformation of rig-i . rig-i k270a, which binds weakly to atp, is poorly active because dsrna cannot bind stably to rig-i hel as shown by the enhanced recycling of bound cognate rna  <cit> . thus, both rna and atp binding to hel are needed for efficient eviction of card <dig> from hel2i and the constitution of the atp-locked-rig-i/5′pppdsrna complex that can act as an active transduction unit . at the same time, the atpase is activated with atp hydrolysis promoting eviction of the bound rna from the hel domain as shown by the atp hydrolysis-dependent recycling of cognate rna  <cit>  . however, because the 5′pppdsrna is firmly maintained in close proximity by remaining bound to the ctd , it can immediately rebind in cis to hel to resume another cycle of atpase activity . this multiple repetition of rna/hel association/dissociation powered by the atpase motor maintains sufficient card exposure  to ensure a sustained number of activated rig-i molecules per time unit above the critical threshold required for commitment, that is, ubiquitination and interaction/activation with/of mavs and switch-on of the ifnβ promoter . because the ctd  is strictly required and accommodates itself into a pocket in hel2i when hel is occupied by the rna, one cannot exclude a possible contribution of the ctd to hel2i interaction in the full eviction of the cards from hel2i, as recently suggested  <cit> .fig.  <dig> model of atpase-mediated discrimination of non-self rna by rig-i. a activation model of wt rig-i. in resting state, rig-i is in an auto-repressed form with card <dig> binding to hel2i, which prevents rna binding to the hel domain. upon a viral infection, rig-i ctd selectively catches non-self 5′pppdsrna . this favors the cis-binding of 5′pppdsrna to the hel domain that allows/enhances atp binding by allosteric effect . atp binding promotes rig-i folding into closed state with release of card <dig> away from hel2i and exposure of the cards . atp hydrolysis causes adp+pi release, hel opening, allosteric weakening of the rna to hel interaction and card resequestration . because remaining bound to ctd by its 5′pppdsrna end, rna rebinding to hel in cis is favored , which resumes another cycle of atp fixation, card release and atp hydrolysis . rapid repetition of rna/hel association/dissociation powered by the atpase motor with on/off cycling of card exposure  ensures a sustained level of activated rig-i molecules per time unit above the critical threshold required for effective signalling. b a fortuitous binding of self rna to hel  induces atp fixation, closed conformation and atp hydrolysis that irreversibly evicts the rna from hel, because it lacks ctd anchoring. consequently, the cards are exposed too transiently, if ever, to reach the threshold number of transduction units per time unit required for signalling . c model of the constitutive activity of rig-i-e373q. surrounding  rna serendipitously binds to hel , allows atp binding with eviction of card <dig> from hel2i . the slow atp hydrolysis refrains the eviction of the rna from the hel and card <dig> resequestering . consequently, a sustained level of activated rig-i-e373q molecules with their cards exposed accumulate above the threshold level required for ifnβ promoter activation . card: caspase activation and recruitment domain; ctd: c-terminal domain; hel: helicase



in this model, any serendipitous binding of a non-cognate, self rna  directly to rig-i hel  would be rapidly counteracted by rna dissociation from rig-i by the atpase motor  in an irreversible manner, because non-cognate, self rna would lack the strong triphosphate anchoring to the ctd. indeed, artificial non-optimal rna ligands associate with increased atpase activity, increased recycling of bound rna and inability to activate the ifn response in cells  <cit> . consequently, the cards would be either never fully exposed, or only too transiently, to result in enough simultaneous activated rig-i required for downstream oligomerization with ubiquitin chains and mavs . in the case of rig-i-e373q, serendipitous binding of self rna  coupled with slow atp hydrolysis and product release delays the eviction of the rna from hel, and consequently delays card <dig> resequestration  resulting in a high enough number of activated rig-i-e373q molecules per time unit  to give rise to signalling . interestingly, the alternative e373a substitution that is a natural constitutive variant associated with atypical singleton-merten syndrome  <cit>  also displays a similar slow rate of atp hydrolysis . by analogy with the reduced rna binding affinity to the yeast has1p helicase with t/a or s/a substitution in motif iii hydroxyls   <cit> , the reason why the ts/aa rig-i mutant is inactive might be the reduced ability of hel to bind any rna including self rna. thus, the ability of wt rig-i to escape illegitimate activation by self rna is kinetically controlled by fast atp turnover that quickly dissociates non-cognate rna from the hel, thus allowing reestablishment of the auto-repressed state.

model of atpase-mediated discrimination of non-self rna by mda5
in the resting state, our functional data support that mda <dig> is in an inactive  form since mda <dig> cards are constitutively active but cards-hel are not. as suggested by the higher atpase activity resulting from the deletion of the cards from the mda5-e444q mutant, and by analogy with rig-i, mda <dig> cards may bind to hel to compete with rna. as for rig-i, the ctd is strictly required to alleviate the inactive conformation very likely because, according to the crystal structure of mda <dig>  complex, mda <dig> ctd should tightly contact hel2i when hel is occupied by rna, this presumably freeing the cards for signal transduction. all together our data and previously published work suggest the following model for mda <dig> discrimination of self from non-self rna. a viral dsrna binds to mda <dig> hel , which allows ctd binding to hel2i that secures rna binding to hel by inducing the release of the cards . this also results in a conformational change that exposes the self-oligomerization surface, which engages the hel2i of one monomer to the pincer domain of the next mda <dig> monomer. this nucleates an assembly cascade of other mda <dig> molecules on the same dsrna  and formation of a multivalent card platform endowed with efficient signalling power . at the same time, dsrna binding to hel favors the allosteric binding of atp to the atpase motor. this results in atp hydrolysis  which releases the dsrna from the hel domain of mda <dig>  consequently, disassembly of the oligomer is promoted with each mda <dig> monomer returning back to either reassemble  or to the inactive state . the key observation we report here of the dependence of the constitutive activity of mda <dig> atpase mutants on an intact rna binding ability demonstrates that serendipitous binding of wt mda <dig> to cellular  dsrna most likely occurs . in this case, the resulting complex is too short-lived to recruit another mda <dig> molecule before self rna is expelled by the atpase motor . what makes the difference between scenario a  and b  is mainly the length of the rna duplex: in the physiological context of a low endogenous expression of mda <dig>  the probability of the mda <dig> nucleation process, namely recruitment of a second mda <dig> molecule attracted by one bound mda <dig> with exposed oligomerization surface, is predicted to increase with dsrna length because both mda <dig> rebinding to the adjacent dsrna sequence and the frequency of recruitment of mda <dig> monomers along the same rna is favored by dsrna lengthening. in other words, in the case of mda <dig>  the dsrna length would statistically act as a surrogate rna anchor, a role played by the ctd of rig-i. another difference is the atp binding being dispensable for mda <dig> signalling. instead, it is mda <dig> self-oligomerization that further stabilize mda <dig> binding to dsrna, thus creating a multimeric signalling platform. as for rig-i, the atpase of mda <dig> is kinetically required for its desensitization, and reducing the rate of atp hydrolysis prevents timely release of self rna serendipitously bound to mda <dig> hel . consequently, multiple activated mda <dig> molecules accumulate so as to constitute a long-lived multivalent platform that keeps transducing the downstream signal . as discussed for rig-i, the hel domain of the homologous mutants k335a in motif i and ts/aa in motif iii are predicted to have a reduced rna binding ability. however, this lower affinity for dsrna appears still sufficient to engage the nucleation of mda <dig> oligomerization that could not be counteracted because of the associated deficiency in atp binding and/or hydrolysis.fig.  <dig> model of atpase-mediated discrimination of non-self rna by mda <dig>  a activation model of wt mda <dig>  in resting state, mda <dig> is in an auto-repressed form with, by analogy with rig-i, card binding to hel that prevents direct access of any rna to the hel domain. upon encountering, a viral dsrna binds to mda <dig> hel . ctd binds to rna and hel2i and induces card release and exposure of the self-oligomerization domain. this nucleates the binding of another mda <dig> molecule on the same rna  and so on so as to constitute a multivalent card signalling platform . the binding of dsrna to the hel also allosterically favours atp binding to the atpase motor . this drives fast atp hydrolysis  with allosteric release of the dsrna from the hel domain of mda <dig>  disassembly of the oligomer into monomers that returns back to their auto-repressed state. b a serendipitous binding to cellular  rna  can induce atp binding  but the self rna is evicted before any recruitment of another mda <dig> can occur . consequently, there is no signal elicitation . c model of the constitutive activity of atpase-deficient mda <dig>  mda5-e444q serendipitously binds to surrounding cellular  rna via its hel domain  with binding of ctd to rna and hel2i and exposure of both cards and oligomerization site. because of the poor efficiency of its atpase motor, step  <dig> cannot occur, the illegitimate self rna cannot be expelled from the hel domain and multiple mda <dig> in active state assemble into a long-lived multivalent platform  that keeps transducing the downstream signal . note that the multivalent platform may be made of mda <dig> subunits bound to different short stretches of self rna. card: caspase activation and recruitment domain; ctd: c-terminal domain; hel: helicase



CONCLUSIONS
we propose that rig-i and mda <dig> use their atpase motors to kinetically avoid the formation of long-enough lived signal transducing units resulting from the binding of an illegitimate self rna. in the case of rig-i, accurate recognition of 5′pppdsrna is ensured by:  strong binding to the ctd;  cis-recognition of the dsrna moiety by hel locked by cooperative atp binding; and  reiteration of the cis-binding of the ctd-anchored dsrna to hel via multiple atp hydrolysis cycles to sustain enough numbers of activated rig-i per time unit. in the case of mda <dig>  the atpase activity discards any rna bound to mda <dig> hel that does not have a dsrna structure long enough to allow a timely efficient nucleation of mda <dig> into an active oligomeric signalling platform. interestingly, a potential source of natural cellular  dsrna that rig-i and/or mda <dig> might need to discriminate against, has just been uncovered  <cit> . altogether, our work provides a framework to understand at the molecular level the contribution of several natural gain-of-function variants, including the mda <dig> atpase-deficient r337g variant, and rig-i c268f and e373a that are associated with severe auto-immune disorders, including interferonopathy and atypical singleton-merten syndrome  or enhanced clearing of hepatitis c virus  <cit> .
