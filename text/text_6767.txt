BACKGROUND
telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that form the natural ends of linear chromosomes. while telomeres are mostly known for their essential function in chromosome maintenance, they also play an important role in meiotic progression  <cit> . during meiotic prophase, the position of chromosomes within the nucleus is dramatically reorganized and telomeres cluster within a limited area of the nuclear envelope to form the so-called telomere bouquet  <cit> . this conserved reorganization of chromosomes during meiotic prophase has been observed in most eukaryotic organisms and is shown to promote homolog pairing and meiotic recombination  <cit> . recent studies suggest that the bouquet also plays a crucial role in meiotic spindle formation  <cit> .

in fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, the telomere bouquet is observed throughout meiotic prophase. this period is also known as the ‘horsetail nucleus’ stage, during which the nucleus elongates and oscillates back and forth between the cell poles, following the spindle pole body or spb  driven by cytoplasmic microtubules  <cit> . bouquet formation is achieved by expression of a pair of meiosis-specific proteins, bqt <dig> and bqt <dig>  which bridge the telomeric proteins taz <dig> and rap <dig> to the spb component sad <dig>  <cit> . to ensure telomere attachment to the spb, telomeres must be tethered to the nuclear envelope via the interaction between rap <dig> and the inner nuclear membrane complex bqt <dig> and bqt <dig>  <cit> . disruption of any of these components leads to failure of telomere clustering and defective spore formation in meiosis . sporulation defects in the bouquet mutants occur mainly due to impaired spindle formation and partly due to compromised meiotic centromere assembly, followed by chromosome segregation defects  <cit> . recent studies suggest that recruitment of a single telomere tract or centromere to the spb is sufficient to confer functional spindles  <cit> . hence, the telomere bouquet does not only function in alignment of chromosomes but is also crucial for the recruitment of a chromosome to the spb to create a functional meiotic spindle.

although the bouquet composition and its function are becoming better understood, the molecular mechanisms that govern dissociation of telomeres from the spb remain elusive. interestingly, in fission yeast, polarized bouquet configuration is maintained until the end of meiotic prophase, and upon entry into the first meiotic division, telomeres dissociate from the spb in a concerted manner, dubbed ‘telomere fireworks’  <cit> . another interesting observation is that bqt <dig> and bqt <dig> do not localize to telomeres at the onset of the first meiotic division  <cit> . moreover, rap <dig> is highly phosphorylated in mitotic cells  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that disruption of the interaction between rap <dig> and the bqt1- <dig> complex, potentially by means of post-translational modifications of one or both interacting partners, may be responsible for telomere dissociation from the spb. in this report, we investigated whether rap <dig> is involved in the termination of the telomere bouquet. comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis of the meiotic rap <dig> protein revealed that it is progressively phosphorylated throughout meiotic prophase and the number of phosphosites peaks after completion of the bouquet stage. surprisingly, this massive phosphorylation of rap <dig> is dispensable for telomere bouquet dissociation, as indicated by our live microscopy analysis and protein interaction studies of the phospho-mutants. our study illuminates that rap <dig> is a protein resistant to negative charge and functions as a ‘scaffolding’ protein in the telomere bouquet.

RESULTS
rap <dig> is hyper-phosphorylated in meiosis
to investigate the stability of the rap <dig> protein throughout meiosis, a homozygous diploid  temperature-sensitive pat1- <dig> strain carrying a mat-pc cassette was utilized to synchronize meiosis  <cit> . meiosis was induced after nitrogen starvation, followed by a temperature shift from permissive  to restrictive conditions  . progression of meiosis was monitored by assessing the number of nuclei and dna content per cell from fractions collected at 30-minute or 1-hour intervals during the synchronization procedure . in order to assess rap <dig> protein stability during meiosis, rap <dig> was endogenously tagged with pk  epitope peptide and detected by anti-v <dig> antibodies. western blotting analysis of synchronous culture extracts showed that rap <dig> protein is rather stably expressed during meiosis, although lower molecular weight, potentially truncated forms of rap <dig>  were observed at the end of meiosis .fig.  <dig> rap <dig> is hyper-phosphorylated in meiosis. a schematic diagram of meiotic culture synchronization using homozygous diploid cells carrying the temperature-sensitive pat1- <dig> mutation and the mat-pc cassette. b distribution graph of the number of nuclei in meiocytes through meiosis  and images of dapi-stained cells from indicated fractions . facs analysis shows dna duplication from 2c to 4c . c,d western blot analysis of rap1-3xpk from mitotic cycling cells , g <dig> arrested cells  and meiotic cell fractions at indicated times. anti-cdc <dig>  and anti-cdc <dig>  antibodies were used as a loading control and meiosis synchronicity marker, respectively. c separation of cell extracts on a standard gradient gel. d separation of phosphorylated rap1-3xpk on a phos-tag gel. e treatment of rap1-3xpk from the  <dig>  hr fraction with lambda-phosphatase and/or phosphatase inhibitors as a control. note that fast-migrating bands of rap <dig> are observed in this case due to the presence of endogenous phosphatases



interestingly, a number of distinctly shifted bands of rap <dig> were detected during meiotic prophase. similar shifted bands of rap <dig> have also been recently reported  <cit> . to determine if rap <dig> is phosphorylated during meiosis, cell extracts were further analyzed using phos-tag™ sds-page  <cit> . phos-tag™ gel analysis revealed that the rap <dig> protein is highly phosphorylated during meiosis. strikingly, the maximum level of phosphorylation was observed at  <dig> – <dig> hr, when almost none of the fast-migrating forms of rap <dig> were detected . phosphatase treatment confirmed that the shifted bands observed at  <dig> – <dig> hr represented phosphorylated forms of rap <dig> . thus, our data indicates that rap <dig> phosphorylation accumulates as meiotic prophase progresses, and rap <dig> becomes hyper-phosphorylated at the onset of meiosis i, when the bouquet stage ends  <cit> .

mass spectrometry analysis of rap <dig> reveals an increasing number of phosphosites detected upon completion of the bouquet stage
to determine the location of phosphorylation sites in rap <dig>  meiotic rap <dig> was purified from fractions of the synchronized culture at  <dig>  hr and  <dig>  hr, and was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. using trypsin digestion, we covered 70–75% of the rap <dig> protein sequence at 95% peptide threshold, and identified  <dig> and  <dig> phosphorylation sites from  <dig>  hr and  <dig>  hr, respectively . notably, all phosphorylated sites identified at  <dig>  hr were also detected at  <dig>  hr, suggesting that rap <dig> phosphorylation accumulates with progression of meiotic prophase. our analysis revealed several meiosis-specific phosphorylation sites in addition to those detected in mitosis-arrested cells  <cit> . with respect to known protein binding domains of rap <dig>  <cit> , the phosphorylated sites at  <dig>  hr  fell into three clusters, whereas at  <dig>  hr phosphosites were fairly evenly distributed across rap <dig> . interestingly, two and six phosphosites were identified in the bqt1- <dig> binding area  at  <dig>  hr and  <dig>  hr, respectively. notably, although phosphorylations were detected within the bqt <dig> and poz <dig> binding regions, we did not detect any phosphorylation within known structural domains of rap <dig>  altogether, our mass spectrometry data suggest that the number of phosphorylated residues of rap <dig> increases with the progression of meiosis, which is in agreement with our phos-tag™ gel analysis .fig.  <dig> domain organization and schematic of phosphorylation sites of rap <dig> protein detected at  <dig>  hr and  <dig>  hr into meiosis. phosphorylation sites are highlighted as bars with a colour code . protein interaction domains are indicated above and the structural domains are shown at the bottom. brct, brca <dig> c-terminus domain; myb domain, myb-like domain; rct, rap <dig> c-terminus domain



hyper-phosphorylation of rap <dig> in meiosis is dispensable for telomere bouquet formation and dissociation
since we observed that rap <dig> phosphorylation peaks at meiosis i, we speculated that the resulting highly negative charge of rap <dig> is responsible for the change in its affinity to the bqt1- <dig> complex. in order to mimic hyper-phosphorylated rap <dig>  all validated phosphorylation sites from s- <dig> to s- <dig> were substituted with negatively charged glutamate residues  . to monitor telomeres and the spb through meiosis, endogenous taz <dig> and sid <dig> were tagged with yfp and mcherry, respectively. to our surprise, the phosphomimetic rap1-32e mutants did not exhibit any detectable meiotic defects and their telomeres clustered and dissociated from the spb in a timely manner very similar to that of the wild-type . accordingly, rap1-32e mutants exhibited no sporulation defects . the corresponding non-phosphorylatable mutant form of rap <dig>  also did not cause defects in meiotic progression and telomere bouquet behaviour . western blot analysis from meiotic cell extracts confirmed that the mutant forms of rap <dig> were stably expressed, and the phospho-modification of rap1-32a was significantly reduced . finally, our yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed that the bqt1/ <dig> binding domain of rap <dig> falls within 216– <dig> amino acids, and introduced cluster mutations did not affect its interaction with the bqt1- <dig> complex .fig.  <dig> rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation in meiosis is dispensable for telomere bouquet clustering/dissociation. a schematic of phosphomimetic and unphosphorylatable cluster mutants of rap <dig> created and analyzed in this study. additional mutation sites introduced in 17e/a  are highlighted in red. b series of frames from films of meiosis. the spb and telomeres were observed via endogenously tagged sid4-mcherry and taz1-yfp, respectively. time count starts from the beginning of filming. scale bar equals  <dig> μm. example of defective meiotic spb is shown in rap1∆. none of the rap <dig> cluster mutants exhibit defective spb . c frequency of normal four-spore asci in rap <dig> phosphomutants. zygotic asci generated from the indicated genotypes in an h

suspecting that some phospho-modifications might remain unidentified in our study, five additional serine and threonine residues , along with  <dig> detected phosphosites within and adjacent to the bqt1/ <dig> binding domain, were all substituted to glutamate  or alanine  . however, these mutations also did not cause any defects in meiosis . thus, we conclude that accumulation of negative charge at the bqt1- <dig> binding domain of rap <dig> does not affect its ability to form the bouquet.

because rap1-32a and rap1-32e bear mutations within the binding domain of the telomerase negative regulator poz <dig>  <cit> , we checked whether telomere length regulation was impaired in the rap <dig> phospho-mutants. since c-terminus tagging of rap <dig> impaired telomere length homeostasis , the pk epitope tag was fused to the n-terminus. although phosphomimetic forms of the rap <dig> protein  migrate slower than wild-type rap <dig>  none of the cluster mutations affected protein stability . the strains carrying mutant rap <dig> maintained their telomere length comparable to that of wild-type . accordingly, all mutants retained their ability to interact with poz <dig> by the yeast two-hybrid assay . additionally, both 32a and 32e mutant forms of rap <dig> retained the ability to interact with bqt <dig> . indeed, telomere localization to the nuclear periphery in interphase was not impaired in rap1-32a and 32e mutants . thus, hyper-phosphorylation of rap <dig> observed in meiosis does not appear to have a role in telomere bouquet regulation. furthermore, our mutagenesis analysis suggests that rap <dig> is able to resist high negative charge changes without affecting its function in meiosis or telomere length homeostasis.

intrinsic negative charge of bqt1/ <dig> binding domain of rap <dig> is crucial for telomere bouquet formation
rap <dig> protein is negatively charged, and the bqt1/ <dig> binding region is particularly rich in hydrophobic and negatively charged amino acid residues. some of these negatively charged residues  are well-conserved among fission yeast species . importantly, mutation analysis indicated that rap1-dd337aa  no longer interacts with the bqt1- <dig> complex, but retains its ability to interact with bqt <dig> and poz <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assay .fig.  <dig> negative charge of rap <dig> bqt1/ <dig> binding domain is important for functional telomere bouquet. a alignment of rap <dig> protein sequences from different fission yeast species, highlighting a highly conserved area within rap <dig> . sp, schizosaccharomyces pombe; scr, s. cryophilus; so, s. octosporus; sj, s. japonicus. b morphology of zygotic asci of rap1-dd337aa mutant compared to cells expressing wild-type rap <dig>  frequency of normal four-spore asci is shown in fig. 3b. c mitotic cells expressing rap1-yfp or rap1-yfp  and taz1-mcherry . both wild-type rap <dig> and rap1-dd337aa co-localize with taz1-mcherry. scale bar equals  <dig> μm. d series of frames from films of meiosis. the spb, telomeres and chromosomes were observed via endogenously tagged sid4-mcherry, rap1-yfp and hht1-cerulean, respectively. time count starts from the beginning of filming. scale bar equals  <dig> μm. top image, wild-type cells; and bottom four images, examples of defective meiosis in rap1-dd337aa. note that rap1-dd337aa meiosis is reminiscent of rap1∆ meiosis shown in fig. 3b




to study the function of rap1-dd337aa, endogenous rap <dig> was mutated and fused to yfp. accordingly, rap1-dd337aa mutants were defective in sporulation . live cell imaging of the mutant showed that rap1-dd337aa localized to telomeres, as determined by co-localization to taz <dig> , but did not cluster at the spb in meiotic prophase . furthermore, in many cases the spb was destabilized and detached from the nucleus and, as a consequence, aberrant chromosome segregation was observed . these meiotic phenotypes are characteristic of rap1∆ mutants as well as the bouquet-defective mutants  <cit> . however, rap1-dd337aa was stably expressed and telomere length of the rap1-dd337aa mutant was the same as that of wild-type . additionally, telomeres of the mutant cells were retained at the nuclear periphery in interphase . thus, rap1-dd337aa is a meiosis-specific loss-of-function mutation, and negatively charged aspartates at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are crucial for bouquet formation.

discussion
in this study we have shown that the level of phosphorylation of rap <dig> gradually increases during the course of meiotic prophase, peaking in meiosis i. the spb is known to recruit a number of kinases and phosphatases that modify its subunits, and these modifications play a critical role in regulating mitotic commitment and meiotic progression . since telomere heterochromatin comes into close contact with the meiotic spb during chromosomal bouquet configuration, the telomere-bound proteins are likely to be exposed to these kinases. additionally, dna damage checkpoint kinases are activated during meiotic recombination  <cit> . in fact, some phosphorylations originate from telomere-associated kinases as indicated by reduced shifted bands of rap <dig> at 4– <dig>  hr in the absence of taz <dig> . nevertheless, our study suggests that the hyper-phosphorylation of rap <dig> observed during meiosis is not directly involved in the regulation of the bouquet. rap <dig> can withstand significant charge changes that do not affect interactions with its binding partners and its function in meiosis. hence, rather than a functional regulatory protein, meiotic rap <dig> appears to be a ‘scaffolding’ protein, that is targeted by multiple kinases. interestingly, while mutating  <dig> phosphorylation sites did not alter rap <dig> function, mutation of only two highly conserved residues  disrupted its ability to bind to the bqt1- <dig> complex, causing pronounced defects in telomere clustering and chromosome segregation. in contrast, the binding partners bqt <dig> and bqt <dig> are positively charged, suggesting that rap <dig> binds to the bqt1- <dig> complex through hydrogen bonding interactions. thus, we speculate that negatively charged residues at rap1’s interaction surfaces are evolutionarily conserved in order to retain affinity under shifts in charge occurring throughout meiotic prophase.

rap <dig> is also highly phosphorylated in the mitotic cell cycle, particularly in m-phase. among the phosphorylation sites reported for mitotic rap <dig>  five phosphorylation sites  were shown to have an inhibitory effect on rap1-bqt <dig> interaction, which was demonstrated by the phosphomimetic rap1-5d/5e mutants  <cit> . in mitosis, cdc <dig> phosphorylates three of these sites in order to temporarily release telomeres from the nuclear envelope. this mechanism assists faithful chromosome segregation in anaphase. however, rap1-5d and rap1-5e mutants do not have any sporulation defects  <cit> , which suggests that the bouquet is intact. this is surprising since the rap1-bqt <dig> interaction is required for telomere clustering in meiosis  <cit> , and raises the possibility that telomeres remain associated with bqt <dig> and the spb via different mechanisms. notably, four residues of rap <dig> including cdc <dig> targets were also found to be phosphorylated throughout meiotic prophase in our study  . unlike the rap1-5e mutant protein, our phosphomimetic cluster mutant rap1-32e, which includes 5e mutation , was able to interact with bqt <dig>  thus, we predict that pre-meiotic hyper-phosphorylation of rap <dig>  counteracts cdc <dig> kinase action to preserve affinity to bqt <dig>  and thereby maintain telomere localization to the nuclear membrane and bouquet configuration.

CONCLUSIONS
rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation observed during meiotic prophase does not have a direct role in telomere bouquet regulation. rap <dig> uses its negatively charged amino acid residues to bind the bqt1- <dig> complex. therefore the interaction is not affected by changes in net charge caused through progressive hyper-phosphorylation.
