BACKGROUND
it is highly likely that neurogenic dysfunction of the urinary bladder is involved in various disorders of the lower urinary tract  including neurogenic bladder, outflow obstruction, idiopathic detrusor instability, overactive bladder, painful bladder syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy. in addition, chronic pathological conditions that cause tissue irritation or inflammation can alter the properties of sensory pathways, leading to a reduction in pain threshold and/or an amplification of painful sensation   <cit> .

depending on the pathology, several mediators and their respective receptors have been proposed to modulate peripheral nerve plasticity in the lut, including but not limited to: purinergic receptors in general  <cit>  or p2x receptor in particular  <cit> , trpv <dig>  <cit> , substance p acting on nk <dig> receptors  <cit> , protease activated receptors  <cit> , and nerve growth factor and its receptors  <cit> .

in this context, the development of cross-sensitization in the pelvis is one of the suggested mechanisms underlying co-morbidity of pelvic disorders which is frequently observed in the clinical setting  <cit> . recently, evidence indicated that acute colonic inflammation triggers the occurrence of urinary bladder detrusor instability via activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily  <dig>  related pathways  <cit> . moreover, colonic inflammation-induced activation of trpv <dig> receptors at the peripheral sensory terminals results in an up-regulation of voltage gated na+ channels on the cell soma of bladder sensory neurons  <cit> . this increase in channels may underlie the occurrence of peripheral cross-sensitization in the pelvis and functional chronic pelvic pain  <cit> .

the new hypothesis being tested in this manuscript is that increased levels of vegf observed during bladder inflammation provoke nerve plasticity. this hypothesis is based on evidence indicating that nerves and blood vessels are anatomically associated, follow a common molecular pathway during development, and their maturation in adulthood may be controlled by the same key molecules responsible for their development  <cit> . the finding that mutant mice  lacking sensory nerves also show disorganized blood vessel branching  <cit> , suggests that local signals such as vegf supplied by nerve fibers, may provide a cue that determines blood vessel patterning.

evidence has been presented supporting the hypothesis that many proteins that were originally discovered to be required for axon guidance are implicated in the development of the vascular  <cit>  and lymphatic systems  <cit> . but perhaps the most striking observation linking the nervous and vascular systems is the finding that angiogenic factors, when deregulated, contribute to various neurological disorders, such as neurodegeneration. the prototypic example of this cross-talk between nerves and vessels is the vascular endothelial growth factor, vegf  <cit> . although originally described as a key angiogenic and permeability factor, it is now well established that vegf also plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system  <cit> .

recently, we provided evidence that chronic inflammation increases the density of bladder sensory nerves that express: a) the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily  <dig>   <cit> , b) protein gene product   <cit> , c) substance p, and d) calcitonin gene-related peptide   <cit> . we also determined that b <dig>  a vegf neutralizing antibody, prevented inflammation-induced increase in sensory nerves  <cit> . furthermore, instillation of vegf into the bladder recapitulated the effect of inflammation on sensory nerve plasticity  <cit> , and represents direct evidence of vegf action on the peripheral nervous system.

the scope of the present work was to determine whether vegf, in addition to increased sensory nerve density, also alters the density of cholinergic nerves, and, consequently, bladder function and visceral sensitivity.

RESULTS
instillation of vegf into the mouse bladder results in an increase in sensory nerve density
it was reported that vegf is expressed at relatively higher amounts in nerves than in the surrounding mesenchymal tissue  <cit> . this finding led to a new appreciation of the role of vegf in neuronal development  <cit>  and stimulated us to review a possible link between vegf-induced inflammation and bladder nerve plasticity. to provide direct evidence that vegf induces bladder neuronal plasticity, vegf was instilled into the c57bl/ <dig> mouse bladder. previous results from our laboratory indicated that acute or chronic instillation of vegf into the mouse bladder caused inflammation, characterized predominantly by the accumulation of macrophages  <cit> , and an increase in sensory nerve density as indicated by image analysis of nerve fibers positive for the nociceptive transducer vanilloid type  <dig> transient receptor potential receptor   <cit> . in the present manuscript, we expanded the time course of vegf exposure by including a group that received two weekly instillations of vegf. female c57bl/ <dig> mice were instilled weekly for two weeks with vegf . mice were euthanized one week after the second vegf instillation and the bladder was removed for image analysis of trpv1-positive fibers. one vegf instillation promotes a substantial increase in trpv1-positive fibers in the urothelium and lamina propria  and in the detrusor and adventitia . two vegf instillations resulted in the most pronounced alteration in sensory nerve plasticity, as indicated by a peak increase in trpv1-positive fibers. after the 4th weekly treatment with vegf, the response was reduced. similar results were obtained with chat mice indicating that  <dig> and  <dig> weekly vegf instillations provoked similar increases in trpv <dig> immune reactivity . these results provide direct evidence that vegf participates in the plasticity of bladder sensory nerves and that two weekly instillations of vegf produced the largest increase in sensory nerve density.

a mouse model for the study of bladder cholinergic innervation
we sought to extend our studies by investigating whether vegf also alters the plasticity of bladder cholinergic nerves. the rationale for the use of the chat-cre mouse model was based on reports that staining peripheric nerves with antibodies targeting the synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase  is not consistent and often fails to detect these neurons. in contrast, cholinergic neurons and fibers of the urinary bladder and surrounding tissues are readily visualized in whole mount preparations isolated from adult chat mice . high quality photomicrographs were used to detailed the disctribution of chat-positive nerves . however, using these high quality micrographs, we found the pelvic ganglia to be so intensely fluorescent that the signals from the surrounding tissues were not readily apparent . when the fluorescence of the pg region was electronically reduced, it was possible to image the innervation of the colon, uterus, and urinary bladder . both preparations also allow the visualization of the pelvic ganglia and its relationship with cholinergic nerves innervating the urinary bladder and other pelvic organs , which will permit the capture of these cells for future patch clamp studies. figure 2e is a high magnification image of the dotted square region of figure 2d and shows the large superficial nerve trunks innervating the adventitial coat. as described in cross-sections presented below, these fibers penetrate deep into the lamina propria and ramify in the urothelium.

in order to confirm that chat positive fibers crossing the urinary bladder were indeed nerve fibers, we stained with an antibody targeting the class iii β-tubulin, a specific neuronal marker  <cit> . both β-iii tubulin- and chat-positive fibers are distributed within the urothelium and detrusor smooth muscle . areas highlighted by dotted squares in figure 3d were photographed at higher magnification to discriminate the overlap of the green and red fluorescence in the urothelium  and detrusor smooth muscle . these images indicate substantial overlap between the cholinergic and tubulin markers and thus show that the cholinergic fibers are indeed neuronal.

an analysis of images from sections shows the relative density of chat fluorescent fibers in the urothelium, lamina propria , detrusor muscle, and adventitia in comparison with areas immunostained by a pan-neuronal marker , sensory nerves , and substance p containing fibers . it has to be noted that pgp <dig>  antibodies resulted in a non-specific labeling of the urothelial layer. a reasonable explanation for this artifact is that the methods recommended for permeabilization of the tissues caused such labeling. these findings precluded the use of the urothelium for quantification purposes of pgp <dig>  but not for trpv <dig> and sp. pgp <dig>  image analysis was performed in two layers: the detrusor smooth muscle and the sub-urothelium that extended from the basal layer of the urothelium to detrusor. overall, these results indicate chat nerves are more prominent in the detrusor muscle when compared to trpv <dig> nerves, whereas, trpv <dig> nerves are more prominent than chat nerves in the lamina propria.

the finding that both sensory  and cholinergic nerves are involved in urinary tract disorders such as overactive bladders  <cit>  raises the question of whether these two systems are anatomically distinct. therefore, we sought to determine whether sensory and motor nerves are co-localized in urinary bladder. using bladder whole mounts that underwent blunt dissection to separate the lamina propria from the detrusor , we observed that trpv <dig> and chat signals appear to overlap in the lamina propria  and to a lesser degree in the detrusor smooth muscle . however, high magnification photomicrographs  indicate that the two types of fibers are separate and run adjacent to each other, primarily around the blood vessels . photomicrographs of bladder cross-sections confirm the results obtained with whole mounts . in addition, higher magnification images illustrate the separation of trpv <dig> and chat fibers in intramural ganglia  as well as in the lamina propria . we conclude that the sensory and motor components do not overlap.

vegf instillation increases the number of chat positive fibers
urodynamic analysis of bladder function after intravesical vegf instillation in awake  mice
to evaluate the effects of intravesical vegf on urodynamic parameters and function of the urinary bladder in vivo, we performed cystometric assessment in conscious mice. micturition cycles were first recorded under control conditions  and served as a baseline  followed by urodynamic evaluation at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after beginning vegf treatment. figure  <dig> shows raw cystometric traces recorded in the same animal before  and  <dig> weeks after intravesical vegf . urodynamic parameters were first compared to the baseline for each mouse followed by further comparisons between the groups . intravesical vegf caused significant changes in the function of the urinary bladder over the course of treatment .

at  <dig> week post-vegf, significant changes included a reduction in micturition pressure  and decreased micturition volume . these parameters were also significantly reduced  <dig> weeks after the initiation of vegf treatment. longer treatment  caused a substantial reduction in inter-micturition interval from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s  and a decrease in bladder capacity from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μl to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μl . there was a tendency towards an increase in the number of non-micturition contractions  after intravesical vegf, although the difference did not reach statistical significance . other cystometric parameters such as intermicturition pressure interval, threshold pressure and basal pressure were unaltered by vegf treatment. additional group of mice  underwent intravesical instillations with pbs and cystometric parameters were recorded at the same time points as in the vegf group. intravesical pbs did not significantly affect the function of the urinary bladder . in addition, the baseline values did not differed between the pbs and vegf groups and, therefore, baseline values were combined in figure  <dig> 

intravesical vegf caused an up-regulation of voltage gated na+ channels  in bladder drg neurons
it is well established that bladder inflammation causes an increase in vgsc expressed in sensory neurons receiving input from the urinary bladder  <cit> . in this set of experiments we aimed to determine if intravesical vegf would cause any changes in vgsc, thereby, affecting neuronal excitability of bladder projecting afferents.

retrograde labeling of lumbosacral sensory neurons with fast blue allowed identification of bladder projecting drg cells used for electrophysiological recordings and data analysis. bladder inflammation caused by intravesical vegf triggered an increase in the amplitude of total na+ current recorded from bladder afferent neurons. representative raw recordings of total na+ current obtained from the control  and experimental  groups are presented in figure 11a. the current–voltage  relationship of total na+ current normalized to the cell size shows that these neurons produced a large amplitude na+ current upon membrane depolarization, reaching maximal amplitude at - <dig> mv . vegf application increased the peak amplitude of total na+ current in bladder drg neurons at - <dig> mv from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in the control group to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in the vegf group . significant enhancement of total na+ current was observed at all voltages from - <dig> mv to + <dig> mv .

we next assessed the kinetic parameters of total na+ currents after the induction of neurogenic bladder inflammation caused by vegf. the steady-state activation was studied by using a three-pulse protocol with a negative pre-pulse to - <dig> mv and a series of short depolarizing pulses  to activate na+ currents . the amplitude of steady-state activation was measured at the peak of tail current upon the voltage step to - <dig> mv, normalized and plotted as i/imax against the voltage . intravesical vegf led to the leftward shift in the steady-state activation of total na+ current by  <dig> mv . the amplitude of steady-state inactivation was measured at a series of membrane depolarizing steps ranging from - <dig> mv to + <dig> mv . bladder inflammation did not affect the parameters of steady-state inactivation of total na+ current in bladder sensory neurons .

vegf triggered an enhanced abdominal sensitivity to mechanical stimulation with von frey filaments
abdominal sensitivity was tested in a separate group of mice  before and after bladder treatments with vegf. figure  <dig> summarizes the frequency of responses to von frey filament testing in the lower abdominal area before, and  <dig> week and  <dig> weeks after intravesical instillations of vegf in the same group of mice. the response frequency correlated with the applied force, reaching a plateau of 20% at the maximal tested force of  <dig> g . one week after vegf treatment, mice became more sensitive to the filament testing and responses reached more than 40% at lower forces of  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g . two weeks after the treatment the frequency response showed significant differences with stimuli of  <dig> and  <dig> g filaments in comparison to  <dig> week .

these results provide evidence that intravesical vegf leads to an increased viscerosomatic response to cutaneous stimulation in the pelvic region. such a response is usually associated with abdominal discomfort and/or pelvic pain.

discussion
the major findings of the present manuscript are: 1) the instillation of vegf produces an increase in sensory nerve density, presumably by nerve sprouting, that reaches a maximum at  <dig> weeks and declines by  <dig> weeks; 2) in addition to significant increase in sensory nerve fibers, vegf increases the density of bladder cholinergic nerve fibers; and 3) the increase in nerve density produced by vegf results in altered bladder function and visceral sensitivity. the unique feature of our findings is that vegf produces an increase in nerve density via urothelium.

the nervous and vascular systems share several anatomical parallels. both systems utilize a complex branching network of neuronal cells or blood vessels reaching all regions of the body. the anatomical similarity of the nervous and vascular systems suggests that axons might guide blood vessels and vice-versa  <cit> . indeed, signal molecules produced by peripheral neuronal cells, such as vegf  <cit> , guide blood vessels  <cit>  and signals from vessels, such as the neurotrophins ngf and nt- <dig>  are required for, and orchestrate extension of neurons adjacent to vessels  <cit> . in this manner, the neuronal and vascular systems are well organized and coordinated in normal adult tissues. however, in chronic inflammatory states particularly in the lut, little is known about how the nerve-vessel relationship functions and whether it could underlie the chronic pain syndrome observed in patients with disorders of the lower urinary tract. in this context, this manuscript presents a body of evidence implicating vegf signaling in the enhanced innervation of the urinary bladders in mice and the consequent alteration in mechanical responses and visceral sensitivity.

interest in guidance molecules, and particularly vegf, modulating both vascular and neuronal pathology is emerging  <cit> . changes in vegf levels are associated with alterations in the vascular system of the urinary bladder  <cit> . vegf is increased in bladders of patients with painful bladder syndrome, and this increase is associated with glomerulations on hydrodistension  <cit> . however, increased bladder vegf is not observed in patients who do not show petechial bleeding or in controls  <cit> , suggesting that vegf levels are associated with those pbs patients exhibiting alterations in the bladder microvascular system.

at this moment, it is not readily apparent which of the vegf receptor subtypes mediates the bladder neuroplasticity in the mouse model. both vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> as well as nrp <dig> and nrp <dig> are highly expressed in urothelium and intramural ganglia  <cit> . we also reported that control human bladders urothelium present a predominance of vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig> over vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig> immunoreactivity and that pbs patients present a decrease in vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig> expression  <cit> . nevertheless, our results strongly suggest a new and blossoming vegf-driven processes in the bladder that may be a putative target in neuronal plasticity. however, the role of vegf pathway in bladder neuroplasticity is in its infancy. in contrast, the roles of ngf and bndf in neuroplasticity are well established in bladder pathology  and have resulted in the testing of ngf-/bndf-antibodies  as possible therapeutic options. therefore, it is tempting to propose that vegf neutralizing antibodies, such as avastin, or vegf receptor antagonists may be of benefit to reduce inflammation-induced bladder neuronal plasticity. however, it has to be kept in mind that this growth factor is necessary not only for developing vessels and angiogenesis but also vegf signaling is required for vascular homeostasis  <cit>  and the consequences of reduced levels of vegf can impact the kidney vasculature as seen in pre- eclampsia  <cit> . a promising alternative for neutralization of vegf seems to be the blockade of neuropilins by engineered antibodies  <cit> . however, it is too early to predict whether neutralization of neuropilins will have any deleterious effect on the established vasculature.

the rationale for the methodology employed here is based upon our previous observations that vegf is taken up by the intact urothelium. we showed that following intravesical instillation of a fluorescent vegf tracer  which only internalizes in cells expressing active vegf receptors  <cit> , results in accumulation of this growth factor in suburothelial layers  <cit> . after binding these receptors, vegf may be transcytosed by the urothelial cells into deeper suburothelial layers. alternatively, vegf could affect the permeability of the urothelium through mechanisms reminiscent of vegf’s effects on vascular permeability, which results in paracellular transport of vegf. indeed, the protein constituents comprising this highly effective urothelial barrier , occludins  <cit> , claudins  <cit> , and zonula occludens- <dig>  <cit>  have been recently studied in detail  <cit>  and are known targets of vegf-mediated effects on vascular permeability. after the uptake, vegf produces both bladder inflammation and changes in neuronal plasticity  <cit> . the hypothesis that vegf is taken up by the urothelium was substantiated by the following findings: 1- vegf receptors are expressed in the mouse  <cit>  and human bladders  <cit> ; 2-vegf neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced inflammation and neuronal plasticity induced by intravesical bacillus calmette-guérin  stimulation  <cit> ; 3- an antibody targeting neuropilins  reduces bladder inflammation  <cit> ; 4- vegf itself reproduced the findings obtained with bcg by causing bladder inflammation and sensory nerve plasticity  <cit> .

increase in cholinergic fibers
although an increase in sensory nerve density, particularly those expressing trpv1-ir, has been proposed to underlie pain sensation and neurogenic detrusor overactivity  <cit> , our past work did not explore whether the increased nerve density also resulted in altered function  <cit> . in order to investigate motor nerves, we used a unique mouse model expressing a fluorescent protein under the endogenous chat gene promoter, we present evidence that direct application of vegf into the mouse bladder increases the density of peripheral cholinergic nerves. to the best of our knowledge this increase in cholinergic nerve fibers represents a new finding that was only possible by the use this chat transgenic mouse, a model which will open a new area of research on the role of vegf and its receptors in bladder motor function.

how does vegf produce its effects?
vegf and its receptors are known neuronal guidance molecules and, therefore, it is expected that they affect nerves. however, the inflammation induced by vegf may be another possible mechanism leading to an increase in neuronal density. indeed, vegf mediates inflammation in the bladder as shown by the findings that instillation of vegf causes vasodilation, edema, and macrophage recruitment, hallmarks of inflammation  <cit> , while application of neutralizing vegf antibodies significantly reduce bladder inflammation  <cit> . at this time, there is no definitive evidence suggesting a specific inflammatory cell regulating bladder nerve plasticity. however, given the known trophic effects of vegf on neurite growth prolonged survival of neurons  <cit> , and reinnervation following local nerve damage  <cit> , it is reasonable to propose that inflammatory cells producing vegf may mediate these growth effects on neurons. this new appreciation of vegf signaling in bladder inflammation is supported by emerging evidence that vegf is increased at the site of inflammation, and that infiltrating lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells may represent additional sources of vegf  <cit> . the involvement of cholinergic nerves on bladder inflammatory responses to vegf suggests a cross-talk between the autonomic and immune systems. whether the immune system is functionally and anatomically connected to the bladder nervous system remains to be determined. however, a recent investigation proposes that afferent and efferent signals transmitted in the vagus nerve modulate innate immune responses and are components of an inflammatory reflex  <cit> . therefore, it is fair to propose that vegf increases the cross-talk between the immune and autonomic systems.

vegf alters bladder function
we showed for the first time that vegf affects bladder function and modulates micturition reflex pathways.

analysis of urodynamic parameters recorded in conscious mice confirmed the suggested role of vegf in modulation of micturition reflex pathways. it is known that exogenous vegf  can lead to detrusor and urothelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia  <cit> . in addition, previous immunohistochemical analyses of human specimens detected increased innervation in the suburothelial and detrusor layers of the urinary bladder in pbs patients  <cit> . in our mouse model, we established that intravesical vegf treatment resulted in an increase in the density of chat fibers in both the detrusor smooth muscle and urothelial layers. this increase in nerve density was associated with altered bladder function as indicated by a decrease in the duration of intermicturition interval, reduced voiding pressure, micturition volume and bladder capacity during continuous filling cystometry. at this time, the individual contributions of sensory and motor nerves to the vegf-induced increased bladder motility are not clear. blockade of trpv <dig> with capsazepine may shed some light in this respect.

our results are consistent with other studies which established similar urodynamic changes in animal models of bladder irritation/inflammation  <cit> . for instance, overexpression of neurotrophic nerve growth factor , a well-known modulator of neural plasticity, in the urinary bladder of mice caused bladder hyperreflexia associated with increased voiding frequency  <cit> . these changes were accompanied by an increased density of calcitonin gene-related peptide, sp and neurofilament   <dig> positive fibers, as well as tyrosine hydroxylase-positive sympathetic nerve fibers within the suburothelial nerve plexus of the urinary bladder  <cit> . additionally, expression of several trp channels, including trpa <dig>  trpv <dig>  and trpv <dig>  was increased in the urinary bladder of mice over-expressing ngf  <cit> . interestingly, the urinary bladder phenotype observed in mice with urothelial overexpression of ngf was associated predominantly with the afferent limb of the micturition reflex, whereas our results provide evidence that vegf affects both afferent and efferent neural pathways. our data confirmed the suggestion that vegf may be a potent modulator of neural plasticity in the lut. other investigators also suggested that vegf is a more potent stimulator of neuronal plasticity compared to a number of different neurothrophic factors  <cit> . however, a cross-talk between vegf and neurotrophins cannot be discarded. on one hand administration of vegf can support and enhance the growth of regenerating nerve fibers, probably through a combination of angiogenic, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective effects  <cit>  and conversely, neurotrophins, such as ngf have been described as pro-angiogenic factors  <cit> . on the other hand vegf had neurotrophic effects comparable with bdnf, nt <dig>  or nt <dig> on the rat isolated pelvic ganglia in culture,  <cit> . in addition, vegf was found to be more potent than bdnf in inducing chat-expressing fibers  <cit> . moreover, the synergistic biological activity of vegf and ngf  <cit>  is supported by the finding that mechanical stretch of sympathetic neurons seems to induce vegf expression via a ngf and cntf signaling pathway  <cit> . an intriguing recent hypothesis explaining the cross-talk between vegf and neurotrophins proposes the convergence of putative signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . in this work, kidins <dig> /arms  was identified as a main player in the modulation of neurotrophin and vegf signaling in vivo, and a primary determinant for neuronal and cardiovascular development  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, it was demonstrated that kidins <dig> interacts with neurotrophin, vegf, ephrin, and glutamate receptors, and is a common downstream target of several trophic stimuli  <cit> . adding to the cross-talk between neurotrophins and vegf on neuronal plasticity, the present results go one step further by indicating that vegf alters both sensory  as well as motor  nerves. our present results suggest the idea that across-talk between vegf and neurothropins controls bladder motor  nerve plasticity.

electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo revealed several distinct classes of afferent fibers that participate in transmission of sensory signaling upon physiological bladder filling, noxious distension, chemical irritation and inflammation  <cit> . sensory neurons located within drg are the first cells to receive afferent input from the pelvic viscera and, therefore, play a substantial role in the development of visceral sensitivity and pelvic discomfort during pathophysiological conditions. drg neurons express several types of ion channels including trpv <dig> and voltage-gated sodium channels , both of which are well known transducers of nociceptive processing in pain pathways  <cit> . experiments utilizing animal models of acute and chronic inflammation in the genitourinary tract showed an increased excitability of drg neurons receiving direct input from the affected organs  <cit> . in this study, we determined that instillations of intravesical vegf caused an up-regulation of vgsc in bladder sensory neurons identified by retrograde labeling. overexpression of vgsc in bladder drg cells is associated with increased neuronal excitability and enhanced firing rate  <cit> . our results also support the data from human studies which suggested that abdominal pain and altered bladder and pelvic hypersensitivity in patients with oab and pbs may involve organizational and/or functional changes in visceral afferent pathways when bladder sensory neurons become sensitized and hyper-responsive to normally innocuous stimuli such as bladder filling  <cit> .

multiple sodium channel isoforms are expressed in drg neurons  <cit> . sodium channels play a central role in neuronal electrogenesis, therefore, variations in the level of expression of any one of the sodium channel isoforms could, in principle, alter their level of excitability  <cit> . however, a number of modulatory factors such as neuronal functional status, homeostatic regulation of ion channel expression, post-translational modifications, and interactions with regulating molecules and trophic factors can also significantly affect neuronal excitability  <cit> . for instance, brief exposure to ngf, interferon gamma, epidermal growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor can induce an up-regulation of expression of nav <dig>  channel  <cit> . interactions of na+ channels with partner molecules including ngf  <cit> , gdnf  <cit> , contactin  <cit> , annexin  <cit> , gabapentin  <cit> , and other modulators  <cit>  were established to regulate expression of multiple sodium channel isoforms. based on these observations, we suggest that the effects of vegf treatment on na+ channels in our study could be associated either with the changes in the expression ratio between different na+ channel isoforms in bladder sensory neurons or modulation of na+ channel function by regulatory molecules as outlined above  <cit> . additional studies are warranted to identify the exact mechanisms of vegf action on specific na+ channels isoforms and electrical activity of bladder sensory neurons.

the results of behavioral experiments revealed, for the first time, that intravesical vegf induced the development of abdominal hypersensitivity detected by mechanical stimulation of the lower pelvic region. these effects may be explained, in part, by the ability of vegf to increase the density of sp and trpv <dig> positive fibers  <cit> . this suggestion correlates with the previously published studies, which confirmed participation of trpv <dig> in the development of abdominal hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain  <cit> . results with trpv <dig> knockout mice support the role of trpv <dig> in mediating changes in sensitivity. wang et al. determined that abdominal hyperreactivity and cutaneous allodynia were significantly diminished in these genetically modified animals although the lack of functional trpv <dig> receptors did not improve the histological changes in the inflamed bladder induced by either cyclophosphamide  or acrolein  <cit> . in addition to the involvement of trpv <dig> afferents in pelvic sensitivity, other receptors and molecules can also contribute to abdominal hyperalgesia depending on the model and nature of chosen inflammatory agents  <cit> . thus, increased peripheral sensitivity in mice with bacterial cystitis was related to activation of toll-like receptor  <dig>  <cit> . in the acrolein model of bladder inflammation in rats, increased mechanical sensitivity was conveyed, in part, via ngf and trk receptors  <cit> . likewise, inflammatory events experienced earlier in life were established to trigger long lasting changes in sensory pathways leading to altered pelvic sensations during the adulthood  <cit> . altogether, our data provide direct evidence that vegf-induced neurogenic inflammation in the urinary bladder is associated with significant structural and functional changes that may play a key role in the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
the discovery that neuronal guidance molecules such as neuropilins function as co-receptors for vegf has opened up a new field of vegf research and has even revealed potentially new roles for vegf in axonal growth  <cit> . in other words, sprouting of neuronal axons and vessels appear to use common molecular mechanisms for navigation based upon nrp-vegf interactions  <cit> .

we previously provided strong evidence indicating that the mouse  <cit>  and human urothelium  <cit>  express an extraordinary level of vegf receptors and that the expression of these receptors is fundamentally altered in bladder biopsies of pbs patients  <cit> . additional results supported the hypothesis that the mouse bladder urothelium actively internalizes vegf  <cit> .

nevertheless, the function exerted by vegf in the lut is not clear. in both neuronal and vascular cells vegf is known to increase permeability, prevent apoptosis  <cit> , and promote cell survival  <cit>  and proliferation  <cit> . whether vegf exhibits the same functions on urothelial cells remains to be determined. the results presented in this manuscript indicate that vegf also participates in bladder neuronal plasticity and that the increased nerve density is accompanied by alterations in bladder function and visceral sensitivity.
