BACKGROUND
peach  batsch) is a deciduous tree of the rose family . peaches are not only widely planted as fruit trees, but also as ornamental plants such as garden trees and cut branches. budding and grafting are common asexual propagation techniques for fruit trees except breeding purpose because fruit phenotype cannot be maintained via seed propagation. however, seed propagation is possible for ornamental peaches such as ‘yaguchi’ and ‘hokimomo’ because they have been repeatedly propagated via seed for a long time and thus genetically homogeneous. early germination is required to shorten nursery and breeding periods.

seed germination depends on a number of factors, including internal dormancy and the environment  <cit> . seed dormancy is observed in higher plants with distinct physiological and morphological characteristics in different species  <cit> ; however, it is an undesirable characteristic in an agricultural crop where rapid germination and growth are required. moist chilling plays an important role in providing the stimulus required to overcome dormancy, increase germination and produce normal seedlings in ‘gf305’ peaches  <cit> , strawberry trees  <cit>  and sweet cherries   <cit> . seeds of most prunus species require a period of chilling to break seed dormancy . in peaches, removal of the seed coat shortens the chilling periods needed to break dormancy and even improves the germination of non-chilled seeds  <cit> . when the cold treatment is insufficient, seedlings show physiological dwarfing, which is considered a special case of embryo dormancy  <cit> . these results implied that dormancy in peach seeds is caused by exogenous and endogenous dormancy associated with the seed covering layers and the embryo  <cit> .

the ratio of the hormones abscisic acid  and gibberellic acid  is considered a relevant factor regulating seed dormancy. moist chilling induced an increase in ga levels in embryos of the european hazel , suggesting that gas synthesized during cold treatment were responsible for breaking dormancy  <cit> . aba plays a key role in various aspects of plant growth. in the aba biosynthetic pathway, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  is the key enzyme in aba biosynthesis in higher plants  <cit> . the pattern of pacnced <dig> expression was coincident with that of aba accumulation in sweet cherry fruit  <cit> . recent studies indicated that the key step of aba inactivation is the hydroxylation of the 8′-methyl group of aba in most plant tissues. aba 8′-hydroxylase is a key enzyme in the oxidative catabolism of aba and is expressed throughout sweet cherry fruit development.

germination commences with the uptake of water by imbibition by the dry seed, followed by embryo expansion. in our previous study  <cit> , seeds after rinsing with running tap water for 2 days and chilling at 5 °c for more than 8 weeks showed decreased aba contents in the embryonic axis and seed coat, which ultimately increased the uniform germination and normal growth in ‘yaguchi’ peaches. moreover, longer rinsing  increased germination rate and significantly increased the plant height in ‘hokimomo’ peach  <cit> . in vitis vinifera, rinsing with running water for 8 days increased germination rate from  <dig> to 34 % compared to 4 days  <cit> .

therefore, we hypothesized that longer rinsing of seeds can alter the genes expression in related to dormancy and then raise the germination rate in ‘yaguchi’ peach. in the present study, germination rate of seeds after rinsed for 2 days  and 7 days  and chilled for 4 weeks each  were determined. the aim of the present study was to perform transcriptome analysis among seeds of br, 2d4w and 7d4w seeds and to gain an understanding of molecular mechanism during peach seed dormancy and to prove the hypothesis.

in recent years, rna-sequencing  technology has become the most popular and powerful tool for transcriptome analysis. rna-seq is cheaper, more efficient, more sensitive and more accurate in generating transcriptome profiles than microarray analysis and other techniques . we use rna-seq technology to identify and characterize the expression of the large number of genes, especially those differentially expressed during dormancy progression.

RESULTS
the germination rate of embryo in peach
the germination rate of ‘yaguchi’ after rinsing for 7 days was significantly higher than that after rinsing for 2 days when the chilling period was 4 weeks . chilling periods of between  <dig> and 8 weeks promoted seed dormancy breaking and increased the final germination rate to 90–100 %  and resulted in heights of around 15–20 cm, while rinsing for 7 days significantly increased the height, even after 4 weeks of chilling . these data the seedling initial germinate after 2d4w and 7d4w each. therefore, we analyzed the transcriptome only in dry seed before rinsing , 2d4w and 7d4w in ‘yaguchi’ peaches using next-generation sequencing.fig.  <dig> effects of rinsing and chilling treatments on seed germination. the horizontal axis is peach seeds after distinct periods of chilling after rinsing for  <dig> and 7 days . non-overlapping letters  indicate significant difference between treatments, based on anova analysis and multiple range tests procedure with a confidence level of 95 %



de novo transcriptome assembly and assessments of expressed sequenced tags
sequencing and de novo assembly
paired-end  sequences from mrnas generated  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> reads  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  from br, 2d4w and 7d4w, respectively . the regions with low quality scores in the fastq files  and reads containing one or more indistinct nucleotides in the raw sequencing data were removed. high quality transcriptome sequence reads  were preprocessed for further analysis . to further evaluate the quality of the assemblies, the high quality reads were mapped back to the constructed assemblies . almost 95 % of the reads were successfully mapped back to their assemblies. we have also mapped our reads to the total transcript prunus persica annotation v <dig>  on assembly v <dig>   <cit> . br, 2d4w and 7d4w showed the mapping percentages of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. a large number of reads were well matched with peach genes. this could show high accuracy of our contigs assembly. however, the mapping of de novo assemblies was higher than prunus persica all transcripts mapped, therefore, in this study we used data from de novo transcriptome assemblies for the future analysis. the high-quality short reads from transcriptome sequence reads were assembled into unigenes using the trinity program. rrna sequences were excluded from unigenes by removing those matched to the silva rrna database. ultimately, we obtained  <dig>  unique sequences with an average sequence length of approximately 1013 bp; the total length of the sequence was  <dig> , <dig> bases . n <dig> is a statistic widely used to assess the quality of sequence assembly. high values of n <dig> in our data can indicate the effectiveness of assemblies . the variation in n <dig> may be due to differences between tissues and/or treatments, which can be observed in the previous studies  <cit> .table  <dig> the numbers of reads



differentially expressed genes analysis 
we compared the gene expressions among br, 2d4w and 7d4w data and identified differentially expressed genes. normalization was applied to the treatments to provide accurate differential expression rather than individual quantification. total degs patterns for each sample are presented in additional file  <dig>  the significantly degs with fdrs <  <dig>  obtained by comparing br vs 2d4w, br vs 7d4w and 2d4w vs 7d4w libraries were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . the distributions of degs were further analyzed using edger package. degs are visualized as an ma plot  for set of experiments . the red dots highlight transcripts of positive and negative values of log <dig> fold change , indicating that the sequences were upregulated and downregulated genes in each treatment. the genes names, fold changes, and p values for up- and down-regulated degs in each treatment were listed in additional file  <dig> 

functional annotation of degs
for annotation, the consensus sequences were first searched against the swiss institute of bioinformatics databases  database  <cit>  by local blastx  to search for the maximum number of similar genes. among the  <dig> degs in br vs 2d4w,  <dig> and  <dig> were up- and down-regulated genes. from  <dig> degs of br vs 7d4w,  <dig> and  <dig> were up- and down-regulated.  <dig> and  <dig> degs were up- and down-regulated genes in 2d4w vs 7d4w . these genes were identified from blast nr database, swissprot and uniprot database and assigned with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  and gene ontology  terms in the biological process, molecular functions and cellular component categories  <cit> .

functional classification by kegg
kegg pathway database records networks of molecular interactions in cells, and variants of them, specific to particular organisms. pathway-based analysis helps to understand the biological functions of gene products. pathway information for all annotated sequences was obtained from kegg pathway annotations. in total,  <dig> degs of br vs 2d4w,  <dig> degs of br vs 7d4w and  <dig> degs in 2d4w vs 7d4w,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences, respectively were mapped to the reference pathway in kegg . we focused our attention on carotenoid biosynthesis . in the pathways of carotenoid biosynthesis and plant hormone transduction, nced , aba 8′-hydroxylase , abscisic acid receptor pyr/pyl family , serine/threonine-protein kinase srk <dig> , protein phosphatase 2c  and aba responsive element binding factor  were known to have important roles in the seed dormancy and germination  <cit> .

go enrichment analysis of degs
when significant degs were subjected to go enrichment analysis, most of them were significantly represented in the three main go categories of ‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cell component’. in the top hit go molecular function categories, hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing o-glycosyl compounds, atp binding and microtubule binding were significantly enriched between br vs 2d4w and were also highly enriched in the br vs 7d4w comparison. sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity, nad binding and chitinase activity were the most highly enriched terms in 2d4w vs. 7d4w. in the go biological process, microtubule-based movement, carbohydrate metabolic process and translation were significantly enriched between br vs 2d4w and br vs 7d4w, while, regulation of transcription, dna-templated, vesicle docking involved in exocytosis and chitin catabolic process were the most highly enriched terms in 2d4w vs. 7d4w. moreover, ribosomes were found to be significantly enriched in term of cellular components .fig.  <dig> go enrichment analysis. enrichment of gene ontology terms in differentially expressed sequences in br vs 2d4w, br vs 7d4w and 2d4w vs 7d4w



quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  validation of degs from transcriptome analysis
to validate the results from the transcriptome analysis, degs related to the effect of rinsing with water in the germination were determined by qrt-pcr. we selected ten degs with putative functions related to aba biosynthesis, catabolism and signaling; ga biosynthesis and catabolism; and stress response genes . these genes were highly significantly upregulated genes in kegg and degs analysis. specific primers were designed and optimized using pcr for the selected degs and for ubiquitin as the endogenous control. we amplified cdna from five samples: br, after rinsing 2 days , after rinsing 7 days , 2d4w and 7d4w . the transcripts of stress response genes, such as eid <dig>  dreb2c and lea d- <dig>  accumulated during germination and the expressions of most genes were upregulated in 2d and 7d, but downregulated in 7d4w . in particular, lea d- <dig> showed high expression in br and followed by a dramatic declined. most aba biosynthetic genes were downregulated slightly in 7d4w , which was consistent with aba contents in the both embryonic axes . the expressions of aba-hy <dig> and pp2ca in the embryonic axis of peach seeds were upregulated in 2d and 2d4w, and downregulated in 7d4w . similarly, ga2-ox <dig> produces inactive ga in ga biosynthesis  <cit>  that was downregulated in 7d4w . lemads was upregulated in 2d and 7d, and significantly downregulated after chilling for 4 weeks . analysis of transcript levels by qrt-pcr showed that the expressions of the ten selected genes corresponded with the differential expression patterns determined from the transcriptome analysis in 2d4w vs. 7d4w treatment . there were significant relationships between the log  and log  for eid <dig>  dreb2c, afp <dig>  afp <dig>  pp2ca and nced <dig> . the highly significant correlation of linear regression analysis, which indicated good reproducibility between transcript abundance assayed by rna-seq and the expression profile revealed by qrt-pcr data. although the data other four genes did not show a clear correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr, the trends by the treatments were consistent for the ten genes.fig.  <dig> verification of 10-gene expression patterns by qrt-pcr. vertical axis indicates relative gene expression levels and horizontal axis is seed peach treatment. error bars depict the standard error of the mean for three biological replicates. non-overlapping letters  indicate significant difference between treatments, based on anova analysis and multiple range tests procedure with a confidence level of 95 %

discussion
genes associated with phytohormones
phytohormones, such as aba and ga, play an important role in controlling seed dormancy and germination  <cit> , and mediate responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . aba is a positive regulator of dormancy and a negative regulator of germination, whereas ga promotes seed germination  <cit> . in particular, aba has been termed as ‘dorman’ or ‘dormancy inductor’  <cit> .

in this study, pathway analysis of kegg analysis showed upregulation in 2d4w of the unigenes encoding proteins involved in aba biosynthesis and catabolism, including nced <dig>  aba 8′-hydroxylase in carotenoid biosynthesis and pp2c in plant hormone transduction pathways . while only nced <dig> and pp2c showed upreguration in br. nced is the key enzyme in aba biosynthesis in higher plants  <cit> , while aba 8′-hydroxylase is the key enzyme in the oxidative catabolism of aba and is expressed throughout fruit development  <cit> . the expression of nced <dig> is closely associated with the aba level in imbibing dormant seeds of brachypodium distachyon  <cit> . our data suggested that these genes could be involved in modulation of embryo dormancy through aba synthesis and catabolism.

aba signaling is important for stress responses, seed development and dormancy  <cit> . the activity of pp2c is controlled by aba receptors, which upon binding to aba form a complex with, and inactivate pp2c. inactivation of pp2c leads to upregulation of snrk <dig>  which activates downstream transcription factors, including the aba responsive element  binding factor , aba insensitive <dig> , abi <dig> and abi <dig>  and thereby mediates seed responsiveness to aba  <cit> . twenty-one degs were annotated as probable pp2c and were upregulated in the endodormancy state in flower bud of japanese pear  <cit> . in sorghum, the higher expression of an abi <dig> homolog has been associated with higher levels of dormancy  <cit> . in this study, kegg pathway analysis showed that transcripts of a gene encoding pp2c were significantly higher in br and 2d4w. similarly, the qrt-pcr results showed upregulation of pp2c in br and 2d4w and dramatic downregulation in 7d4w . in addition, abi5-binding protein genes were also significantly upregulated in 2d4w and significantly downregulated in 7d4w .

these data suggested that the aba signaling pathway was still activate in dry seed and 2d4w; ie short period rinsing, and it might be significant for maintaining aba sensitivity and endodormancy of the embryo. transcripts of genes encoding ga2-oxidase   <dig>  which inactivates ga <dig>  were significantly higher in 2d4w. ga catabolic genes such as ga2ox are important to control ga levels . these results suggested that the aba signaling pathway and ga inactivating genes play an important role in dormancy and germination and were downregulated by the longer rinsed treatment in ‘yaguchi’ peach seeds.

genes associated with stress response
seed development and maturation are accompanied by increased desiccation tolerance  <cit> . seeds activate a series of mechanisms to respond to many biotic and abiotic stresses during germination when placed in water or their external environment changes. the eid1-like protein  <dig>  shows high similarity to eid <dig> , an f-box protein  <cit> . eid <dig> functions as a positive regulator in aba-dependent signaling cascades that control seed germination, root growth, greening of etiolated seedlings and transition to flowering in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . edl <dig> expression was induced under osmotic stress, high salinity, and aba application  <cit> . our results showed that rinsing for 7d was effective to decrease the expression of eid <dig> gene both at 7d and 7d4w , indicating that longer rinsing decreased eid <dig> expression.

dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins  are transcriptional regulators of the apetala2/ethylene responsive element-binding factor  family that control the expressions of abiotic stress-related genes. under conditions of mild heat stress, transgenic seeds overexpressing dreb2c showed delayed germination and increased aba content compared with the untransformed wild-type in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the dreb2ca loci were upregulated in br, 2d and 2d4w , but downregulated in 7d4w, suggesting that 7d4w released seeds from endodormancy.

furthermore, these results showed that transcripts of genes encoding the lea d- <dig> protein or dehydrin  there was higher expression of the genes encoding the lea d- <dig> in br and then downregulated after chilling . lea proteins are classified into at least five groups by the similarity in their amino acid sequences  <cit>  and are associated with dormancy transition  <cit> . in the norway spruce , the expression of certain dehydrin genes gradually decreased when approaching bud burst  <cit> . in dormant japanese pears, lea genes are significantly higher in the deepest endodormancy period  <cit> . additionally, dehydrins are synthesized by cells in response to aba  <cit>  and most pmlea genes are upregulated by aba treatment  <cit> . these results indicated that the lea gene was induced to develop tolerance against drought in dry seeds without rinsing.

genes associated with transcription factors 
transcription factors  play a crucial role in plant development and stress response  <cit> . one group of well-studied transcription factors involved in chilling responses is the ap2-erebp family members, which have been subdivided into four major subfamilies: the dreb/cbf, ap <dig>  erf subfamilies  <cit> . of these, the dreb/cbf subfamily has been reported to play a major role in the early stages of the chilling response  <cit> , as evidenced by studies in numerous species such as anthurium  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , as well as tea plant  <cit> . in the go molecular function and biological process categories, sequence-specific dna binding tf activity and regulation of transcription were significantly enriched in 2d4w compared with 7d4w . in other words, 7d4w, ie, a longer rinsing treatment, downregulated the expression of several tfs, such as heat stress tf, ap2-like ethylene-responsive tf, dreb2c, ethylene-responsive tf  and the myb tf family . these results suggested that genes of sequence-specific dna binding tf activity are associated with the effects of the longer rinsing combined with chilling on breaking dormancy in ‘yaguchi’ seeds.

mads-box tfs play fundamental roles in plant development, such as floral organ and meristems identity determination and transition from vegetative to reproductive growth regulation. mads-box tfs are involved in bud dormancy regulation in peaches and other species . ppmads13- <dig> and − <dig>  isolated from the leaf bud of japanese pear, appear to be upregulated towards endodormancy establishment and downregulated concomitant with endodormancy release  <cit> , similar to the peach dam <dig> and dam <dig> genes  <cit> . in this study, chilling treatment effectively reduced the expression of lemads . similarly, the expressions of dam <dig> and dam <dig> were decreased significantly by chilling treatment in peach seeds  <cit> . these results indicated that mads-box genes maintain seed dormancy and are repressed when seed dormancy is released by chilling.

CONCLUSIONS
this study indicated that longer rinsing and chilling affects gene expression and germination rate, and investigated key seed dormancy-related genes using next-generation sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of dormant ‘yaguchi’ peach seeds. we identified genes associated with the effects of the rinsing and chilling process, including genes associated with phytohormones, the stress response and tfs. the 7d4w treatment downregulated genes involved in aba synthesis; nced <dig>  catabolism; aba 8′-hydroxylase, aba signaling pathway; pp2c and abi <dig> and ga inactivation; ga2-ox <dig>  which eventually suppressed aba activity and consequently promoting germination and seedling growth. stress response genes  were also downregulated by 7d4w treatment, suggesting that it released seeds from endodormancy. tf genes such as ap2-like ethylene-responsive, dreb2cs, erf and lemads were upregulated in br and 2d4w, suggesting these tfs play important roles in maintaining seed dormancy.
