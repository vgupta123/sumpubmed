BACKGROUND
during early stages of nervous system development, the hindbrain is subdivided into several segments, called rhombomeres . individual rhombomeres are polyclonal compartments, defined both by cell-lineage-restriction and by segmental expression of transcription factors, such as krox <dig>  kreisler and members of the hox gene family. this network of genes regulates the formation of specific rhombomeres and their identities along the anterior-posterior  axis  <cit> . the morphological and molecular segmentation of the hindbrain is essential for the establishment of specific patterns of neuronal differentiation and axon outgrowth and for the formation of distinct streams of migratory neural crest cells, implicated in the subsequent generation of neuronal networks and craniofacial structures .

concurrent with the establishment of hindbrain rhombomeres, a specialized population of boundary cells forms at their interfaces. a series of studies have characterized these cells, demonstrating that boundary cells have an elongated shape, increased extracellular spaces containing matrix components and that they display a reduced proliferation rate and interkinetic nuclear migration compared to intra-rhombomeric cells  <cit> . much less is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate their formation or what the functions of boundary cells are during hindbrain development.

the signaling system of eph tyrosine kinase receptors and their membrane-bound ephrin ligands have been shown to be required for boundary cell formation in zebrafish and xenopus embryos  <cit> . eph receptors and ephrins are largely expressed in alternate rhombomeres such that they interact at their interfaces, and this restricts cells from mixing across hindbrain segments, possibly by mediating cell repulsion  <cit> . in addition, epha <dig> was shown to sharpen hindbrain boundaries by regulating cell affinity within rhombomeres  <cit> . importantly, knocking down eph/ephrin proteins or inhibition of their activation also leads to a decrease or loss of the expression of several boundary cell markers, such as pax <dig> and sema3gb, in the zebrafish hindbrain  <cit> . these results indicate a requirement for this signaling system in boundary cell formation, although it is not known if this is due to a direct role in cell specification or secondary to the increased mixing between segments. whether eph-ephrin interactions are also required for hindbrain boundary formation in higher vertebrates is not known.

several soluble signals were shown to be localized to boundary cells of different species. for instance,wnt <dig> and wnt3a are expressed in zebrafish hindbrain boundaries  <cit> , while fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and fgf <dig> are confined to mouse and chick hindbrain boundary cells, from around e10/hamburger hamilton stage  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . some modulators or inhibitors of signaling systems, such as the tgfβ inhibitor follistatin and the notch modulator radical fringe also accumulate at hindbrain boundaries of chick, mouse or zebrafish embryos  <cit> . little is known regarding the function of these factors at rhombomere interfaces. interestingly, before boundary cells are formed, several of these signals, such as fgf <dig> and follistatin, have segmental expression within specific rhombomeres  <cit> . the significance of these dynamic spatio-temporal expression patterns as well as the regulatory mechanisms by which these signals are turned on and off in different hindbrain regions are not clear.

in this study we set out to determine whether signaling by epha <dig> is required for boundary cell formation in the chick hindbrain. we found that boundary cell markers and the formation of sharp interfaces were lost upon overexpression of dominant negative epha <dig>  unexpectedly, we found that the segmental expression of the boundary cell marker fgf <dig> persisted, raising the possibility that lack of boundary cells may underlie the failure of rhombomeric fgf <dig> to become downregulated. the effect of ablation of boundary cells or blockage of the contact between a rhombomere and one of its boundaries confirmed this possibility. these findings suggest a new role for hindbrain boundary cells in inducing downregulation of the segmental expression of fgf <dig> in rhombomeres.

methods
eggs
fertile loman chick eggs were incubated at 38°c until embryos reached the desired somite-stage . before performing experimental procedures, eggs were windowed and embryos were visualised by injecting black ink below the blastodisc. following manipulations, embryos were incubated to the required stage, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde  and stored at -20°c for further analysis.

in ovo electroporation
pcaggs-ires-gfp  and pcaggs-truncated epha4-ires-gfp  <cit>  constructs were diluted in  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  to a working concentration of  <dig> μg/μl. vectors were injected into the hindbrain lumen of different staged embryos by using a pulled glass capillary. following injection, electrodes were placed at the right and left sides of the embryo at hindbrain levels to obtain unilateral transfection. electroporation was performed using a btx  <dig> electroporator with four  <dig> millisecond pulses of 12– <dig> volts and pulse intervals of  <dig> milliseconds  <cit> .

whole-mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described  <cit> , using chick probes for hoxb <dig>  fgf <dig> , pax <dig> , krox <dig> , follistatin , and nscl <dig> . probes were labeled with digoxigenin -utp and detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibody  followed by nbt/bcip  staining. whole-mount and paraffin-section immunohistochemistry was carried out alone or following some in situ hybridizations. briefly, embryos were incubated in pbs with  <dig> % tween <dig>  5% goat serum for  <dig> hours  prior to incubation for  <dig> hrs with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-gfp , rabbit anti-epha <dig>   <cit> , mouse anti-chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan , as well as recombinant human ephrin a5-fc . following pbs washes, the following secondary antibodies were added: anti-rabbit or anti-mouse alexa  <dig> and anti-rabbit alexa  <dig>  to be visualized under epi-fluorescent microscope, or anti-rabbit and anti-mouse-hrp  visualized with aec substrate system .

in ovo microsurgery
for ablation of boundary cells, a rectangular cut was made with a pulled glass needle around the r3/r <dig> boundary region of 12– <dig> ss embryos and the tissue removed by aspiration. a silicon piece was cut to the precise size and inserted into the gap to prevent boundary regeneration. for barrier insertion, a transverse slit was made just posterior to r3/ <dig> boundary or anterior to r4/ <dig> boundary with a similar needle and the barrier was inserted into the slit. barriers included either aluminum foil or a pcf membrane of  <dig> μm pores , both cut into adequate sizes. 1– <dig> days later, embryos were fixed in 4% pfa and prepared for in situ hybridization.

RESULTS
expression of truncated epha <dig> receptor disrupts hindbrain segment borders
previous studies have shown that overexpression of a dominant negative truncated form of mouse epha <dig>  in zebrafish embryos disrupts the formation of sharp interfaces and of boundary cells in the hindbrain  <cit> . we set out to investigate whether epha <dig> has a similar role in the chick hindbrain by taking a similar approach. we cloned truncated mouse epha <dig> into pcaggs plasmid upstream to an internal ribosome entry site  and a gfp coding sequence to visualize its expression in the transfected cells. first, we assessed the expression level of the construct by electroporating it into the hindbrain of 6– <dig> ss chick embryos. high levels of gfp were found a day later in the electroporated cells which corresponded to dnepha <dig> expression , similar to the expression of control gfp vector . next, the ability of the dnepha <dig> expressing cells to bind ephrin ligands was assessed by performing an in situ binding assay of a soluble ephrina5-fc chimeric protein to the dnepha <dig> expressing cells. strong levels of ephrina5-fc binding were found in ectopic locations in the dnepha <dig> electroporated side of the hindbrain , in addition to r <dig> and r <dig> where endogenous eph receptors are expressed, as seen in control electroporated embryos . together, these results verify that truncated epha <dig> is efficiently expressed and capable of binding its ligands in the chick hindbrain.

to determine whether interfering with epha <dig> signaling disrupts segmental gene expression, we examined the expression of the transcription factor krox <dig> and its direct transcriptional target epha <dig>  <cit> , both normally sharply restricted to r <dig> and r <dig>  in control electroporations, there was an expected r <dig> and r <dig> expression of krox <dig> mrna  and of epha <dig> protein, which was detected with an antibody against the intracellular domain that binds the endogenous epha <dig> but not the truncated ectopic protein . in contrast, there was a disruption to the formation of sharp borders on the electroporated side of embryos transfected with dnepha <dig>  with krox <dig> and epha <dig> expressing cells extending from their normal r3/r <dig> expression domains in the electroporated side into the adjacent r <dig>  r <dig> or r <dig> territories . notably, the data shows variability between embryos in the severity of the effects and in which segment ectopic cells with krox <dig> or epha <dig> expression are observed in. this variability may be due to differences in electroporation efficiencies, intrinsic variability in cell mixing, and whether or not ectopic cells have switched their identity at the time of analysis  <cit> . together, these results suggest that epha <dig> signaling is required to restrict cell mixing between r3/r <dig> and adjacent segments in the chick hindbrain, consistent with previous reports in zebrafish and xenopus embryos  <cit> .

disruption of boundary cells in embryos expressing truncated epha4
the disruption in sharp segmental borders raised the possibility that the formation of boundary cells at rhombomere interfaces is disturbed upon expression of truncated epha <dig> receptor. to examine this, we analyzed the expression of several markers of chick hindbrain boundary cells. the extracellular matrix protein, chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycan , accumulates at high levels at rhombomere boundaries  <cit>  in control electroporations  and in the control side of dnepha4-electroporated hindbrains . in contrast, accumulation of cspg at boundaries is largely disrupted upon expression of dnepha <dig> . double staining with epha <dig> and cspg antibodies in another set of electroporated embryos confirmed that dnepha <dig> transfection leads to disorganisation or loss of rhombomere boundaries together with distortion in the shape of rhombomeres on the electroporated side , compared to the non-electroporated side  and control embryos . notably, in several embryos, r <dig> and its flanking boundaries are less affected by truncated epha <dig> than other boundaries . a similar differential effect occurs following epha <dig> knockdown in zebrafish embryos  <cit> , which can be explained by the presence of eph receptors in addition to epha <dig> in r3/r <dig> that are activated by ephrins in r <dig>  such that r <dig> boundaries are more resistant to decreased epha <dig> function than other boundaries; further analysis will be required to determine whether a similar explanation holds in chick.

we next analysed the effect of dnepha <dig> on the distribution of other boundary cell markers, the paired box gene pax <dig>  <cit>  and the bhlh transcription factor neural stem cell leukaemia  <dig>   <cit> . both markers are expressed in a specific dv-restricted pattern along the hindbrain as well as in higher levels at rhombomere interfaces. we found that there is normal expression of both genes in control embryos  and the non-electroporated side of embryos transfected with dnepha <dig> . in contrast, the elevated expression levels of pax <dig>  and of nscl <dig>  at rhombomere borders decrease following overexpression of dnepha <dig>  whereas their dv-restricted expression within hindbrain segments appears unaffected. these findings suggest that disruption of eph-ephrin signaling does not lead to a general alteration of gene expression throughout the hindbrain but rather to a localized effect at rhombomere interfaces. to further confirm this point, we evaluated the effect of dnepha <dig> on the expression pattern of hoxb <dig>  which is normally localized to r <dig>  we found that in contrast to the sharp borders of r <dig> in controls , expression of dnepha <dig> leads to a mild disruption in the formation of sharp domains of hoxb <dig> expression . notably, as for krox <dig> and epha <dig>  there was a disorganisation consistent with abnormal mixing rather than segmental changes to hoxb <dig> expression, suggesting that expression of dnepha <dig> does not alter segmental identity.

finally, the gross morphology of the manipulated hindbrain was examined by frontal paraffin sections of dnepha4-expressing embryos. while the shape of rhombomere bulges separated by repeated boundary constrictions is evident in the intact side of the hindbrain , a loss of this typical hindbrain morphology occurs on the dnepha <dig> electroporated side . taken together, these results suggest that disruption of epha <dig> signaling in the chick hindbrain leads to a decrease or loss of hindbrain boundary cells, in agreement with previous studies on zebrafish  <cit> .

the boundary cell marker fgf <dig> shows persistent segmental expression in embryos transfected with truncated epha <dig> receptor
fgf <dig> expression was previously described as occurring at early stages in specific hindbrain segments and later in hindbrain boundaries in chick and mouse embryos  <cit> . we carried out a more detailed analysis of the transition of fgf <dig> expression from a segmental pattern to boundary cells. in  <dig> somite stage  embryos, fgf <dig> is expressed in the ventral half of r4-r <dig> and r <dig>  and at lower levels in r <dig> . by  <dig> ss, expression is seen in all even-numbered segments, is downregulated in r <dig>  and some upregulation begins at rhombomere borders . in  <dig> ss embryos, expression in r <dig> is downregulated while still present in the other even-numbered segments, and fgf <dig> transcripts become more apparent at r2/r <dig>  r3/r <dig>  r4/r <dig> and r5/r <dig> boundaries . by  <dig> ss, segmental expression of fgf <dig> is no longer detected in r <dig> while still present in r <dig>  and expression in boundary cells has become even more prominent . finally, in embryos at 30– <dig> ss, fgf <dig> transcripts are confined to the ventral part of hindbrain boundary cells and are absent from all rhombomere bodies . this analysis shows that fgf <dig> expression is firstly restricted to specific hindbrain segments and subsequently downregulated from these rhombomeres while expression is upregulated at rhombomere boundaries.

our previous results show a loss in the expression of several boundary cell markers upon expression of a truncated form of epha <dig> . however, examination of fgf <dig> expression in 28– <dig> ss embryos following transfection of dnepha <dig> at  <dig> ss revealed a surprising result:fgf <dig> was expressed in even-numbered rhombomeres  at stages when this segmental expression would normally be downregulated . indeed, on the contra-lateral side of the dnepha4-expressing hindbrains  as well as in control electroporated embryos , fgf <dig> expression was confined to boundary cells, as expected at this embryonic stage. the effect of dnepha <dig> misexpression was non-cell autonomous since following dorsal electroporation, the transfected cells were not overlapping with the more ventral segmental fgf <dig> expression domains . this result rules out the possibility that fgf <dig> becomes upregulated in cells expressing dnepha <dig>  in contrast to these findings, transfection of dnepha <dig> in older embryos at  <dig> ss, when fgf <dig> is about to become downregulated from r <dig> , did not result in any rhombomeric expression of fgf <dig>  instead, expression occurred only in the boundary cells in both gfp control and dnepha <dig> expressing embryos , further eliminating the possibility that ectopic expression of truncated eph directly induces fgf <dig> upregulation. taken together, these findings suggest that overexpression of dnepha <dig> at stages when fgf <dig> is segmentally expressed leads to failure of the normal downregulation of this aspect of fgf <dig> expression.

downregulation of rhombomeric fgf <dig> requires boundary cells
potential clues to why dnepha <dig> affects segmental fgf <dig> expression are the observations that this effect is non cell-autonomous  and that hindbrain boundary formation is disrupted upon blocking eph-ephrin signaling . a possible mechanism is that the presence of boundary cells is involved in the downregulation of fgf <dig> from hindbrain segments. consistent with this, examination of the normal dynamics of fgf <dig> expression  shows the disappearance of fgf <dig> from even-numbered rhombomeres occurring later than the appearance of boundaries between hindbrain segments. therefore, we took a microsurgical approach in order to examine whether rhombomeric fgf <dig> downregulation is affected in a segment where its adjacent boundary has been ablated. unilateral removal of the r3/ <dig> boundary was performed in  <dig> ss embryos, when this boundary is morphologically visible . as removal of a rhombomere boundary has been previously shown to be followed by its regeneration  <cit> , we inserted a silicon piece into the ablated region to prevent interactions between r <dig> and r <dig> required for regeneration of the boundary . as a control for the microsurgery manipulation, some ablated embryos were allowed to develop without this insert to enable regeneration of the r3/ <dig> boundary. both types of embryos were fixed at  <dig> ss, when fgf <dig> is normally absent from r <dig> . embryos that were lacking the r3/ <dig> boundary were found to express fgf <dig> within r <dig> , while on the contra-lateral side it was already downregulated from r <dig> and localized to the r3/ <dig> and r4/ <dig> boundaries. moreover, fgf <dig> expression was already downregulated from r <dig> at both sides of this hindbrain , as expected from the embryonic stage at the time of fixation , indicating that the continued expression of fgf <dig> in r <dig> on the ablated side is not due to a general developmental delay. the ablation of the r3/ <dig> boundary did not cause fgf <dig> expression in r <dig>  a segment in which fgf <dig> is not expressed at any stage , indicating that the loss of r3/ <dig> boundary does not result in an ectopic upregulation of fgf <dig> in the operated area. in contrast, in embryos in which the ablated r3/ <dig> boundary was allowed to regenerate, fgf <dig> mrna was not detected within r <dig> and was upregulated in the re-formed boundary as in normal embryos . these data suggest that the r3/ <dig> boundary is required in order for fgf <dig> to become downregulated from r <dig> 

compartment boundaries act as organizing centers in several regions during vertebrate morphogenesis such as at the mid-hindbrain boundary and the limb bud. these centers regulate patterning and differentiation of the neighboring tissues by the production and secretion of soluble signals . by analogy, our findings could be explained by the downregulation of fgf <dig> from hindbrain rhombomeres being mediated by soluble factor from boundary cells. this possibility was examined by making a slit between the r3/ <dig> boundary and r <dig> in  <dig> ss embryos, followed by insertion of a piece of aluminum foil as a non-permeable barrier into the slit . this manipulation aimed to block the secretion of a putative signal from this boundary towards r <dig> as well as to prevent cell processes, if present, from interacting between these two regions. embryos were assessed for fgf <dig> expression at ~ <dig> ss, a stage by which it is normally downregulated from rhombomeres . embryos with the inserted barrier beneath r3/ <dig> boundary had fgf <dig> expression within r <dig>  while it has already been downregulated in this segment on the contra-lateral side . notably, fgf <dig> expression was already downregulated from r <dig> on both sides of the manipulated hindbrain, arguing against the possibility that the microsurgery caused fgf <dig> to remain expressed in r <dig> due to a general delay in embryonic development. we next analyzed whether the effect on fgf <dig> in r <dig> is mediated only by the r3/r <dig> boundary or whether prevention of the contact between r <dig> and the r4/ <dig> boundary will also prevent fgf <dig> from becoming downregulated from r <dig>  we found that insertion of a barrier between r <dig> and the r4/ <dig> boundary led to persistent segmental expression of fgf <dig> . this result shows that both boundaries contribute to the downregulation of fgf <dig> from r <dig>  and suggests that the concentration of the putative factor that is released from both boundaries is limiting such that reduction in its amount from either boundary is sufficient to prevent fgf <dig> from being downregulated.

the finding that disruption of boundaries by expression of dnepha <dig> leads to sustained segmental expression of fgf <dig>  argues against the alternative explanation that the effects of barrier insertion are due to disruption of signaling between segments rather than the absence of a normal border in-between. nevertheless, to test this we analyzed whether inserting a barrier anterior to the r3/ <dig> boundary affects fgf <dig> expression. we found that this did not result in sustained fgf <dig> expression in r <dig> or in ectopic expression in r <dig> . this result further confirms that fgf <dig> expression in r <dig>  is not due to a non-specific effect of the operation procedure. moreover, this indicates that it is not signaling from r <dig> to r <dig> that is necessary to downregulate fgf <dig> in r <dig>  but rather the r3/ <dig> boundary itself is required.

to further analyze whether signaling from boundaries in involved in downregulation of segmental fgf <dig> expression, we inserted a permeable membrane of  <dig> μm-diameter pore size, which allows diffusion of proteins, between the r3/ <dig> boundary and r <dig>  in these embryos, fgf <dig> was downregulated from this segment and localized to the boundaries, as in the contra-lateral side of the operated embryo . this control further excludes the possibility that the sustained fgf <dig> expression in r <dig> observed upon the insertion of the non-permeable barrier  is a non-specific effect of the surgical manipulation. the differing effects of inserting a non-permeable  or a porous barrier  suggests that a diffusible factor from r <dig> boundaries are involved in downregulation of fgf <dig> from this segment.

finally, we analyzed whether boundary cells also regulate the expression of follistatin, which is initially expressed in a segmental pattern in several rhombomeres including r <dig>  and later becomes restricted to boundary cells and a dv-restricted stripe  <cit> . we found that prevention of the contact between r <dig> and its anterior boundary at  <dig> ss embryos resulted in higher levels of follistain expression in r <dig> in  <dig> ss embryos . due to the normal dv-restricted expression of follistatin, this result is less clear-cut than for fgf <dig>  but nevertheless argues that boundaries regulate the expression of multiple genes within r <dig> 

discussion
fgf <dig> has dynamic expression in the chick embryo hindbrain in which it is first restricted to specific rhombomeres and later becomes downregulated from these segments and upregulated at rhombomere boundaries. this study shows that embryos that lack hindbrain boundary cells, due to either surgical ablation or overexpression of a truncated epha <dig> receptor, maintain segmental expression of fgf <dig> at stages when it is normally restricted to hindbrain boundaries. moreover, abnormal maintenance of fgf <dig> expression in r <dig> occurs upon insertion of a non-permeable barrier between this rhombomere and either of its boundaries, suggesting that the downregularion of segmental fgf <dig> is induced due to the secretion of signals from boundary cells. these results suggest a novel function of boundary cells in promoting the downregulation of segmental expression of fgf <dig> in hindbrain segments.

eph receptors are required for boundary formation in the chick hindbrain
the inhibition of cell mixing between adjacent rhombomeres is crucial to establish sharp domains of segmental gene expression in the hindbrain. signaling by eph receptors and their ephrin ligands have a key role in the sharpening of boundaries in the zebrafish hindbrain, by interactions across boundaries that restrict cell mixing between segments as well as by regulating cell affinity within rhombomeres  <cit> . our results in the chick embryo, in which expression of dnepha <dig> leads to mixing of cells with r3/r <dig> identities into even numbered territories, suggest that eph-ephrin signaling is required for hindbrain boundary sharpening in a higher vertebrate.

analysis of multiple markers of hindbrain boundaries and of hindbrain morphology shows that formation of boundary cells is severely disrupted in the chick hindbrain following expression of truncated epha <dig>  these results are in agreement with previous reports in zebrafish where inhibition or knockdown of epha <dig> function leads to loss of pax <dig> or sema3gb expression in boundaries  <cit> . it is possible that eph-ephrin signaling at rhombomere interfaces specifies boundary cells directly, or by inhibiting cell mixing, provides a stable interface between rhombomeres that is essential for boundary cells to form.

potential significance of switch in fgf <dig> gene expression
our finding that signaling from hindbrain boundaries promotes the downregulation of the segmental expression of fgf <dig> raises the question of the potential role of this interaction. the dynamic regulation of fgf <dig> in the hindbrain may be an example of the widespread phenomenon of the redeployment of the same signals at sequential stages of development. fgf <dig> and several other secreted factors, such as fgf <dig> and follistatin, initially have rhombomeric expression that then switches to boundary-restricted expression in the chick and mouse embryo hindbrain  <cit> . the early segmental expression of fgf <dig> is required for the induction and patterning of the otic vesicle, which develops from a placode adjacent to the hindbrain  <cit> . in addition, rhombomeric-derived fgfs are required for hindbrain patterning, such as segmental expression of krox <dig> and kreisler/mafb in specific segments  <cit> . recently, we have found that the segmental expression of fgf <dig> is enabled by follistatin that is expressed in the same segments and blocks bmp signaling that would otherwise inhibit the upregulation of fgf <dig>  <cit> . knockdown of follistatin leads to a lack of segmental fgf <dig> expression and disruption to hindbrain patterning  <cit> .

the downregulation of segmental fgf <dig> expression could simply reflect that its initial roles in hindbrain segmentation and inner ear induction have been fulfilled, so continued expression is not required. however, our finding that boundary signals promote the downregulation of fgf <dig> suggests a more active requirement. an attractive possibility is that continued segmental expression of fgf <dig> would interfere with the roles of the subsequent boundary-restricted expression. currently, it is not possible to test this since the role of fgf <dig> expression at hindbrain boundaries is not known. the expression of a number of signaling molecules at hindbrain boundaries in chick  <cit>  is suggestive of roles as signaling centers that pattern adjacent rhombomeres. such a role could be analogous to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary that acts as an organizing centre to pattern cell fate and neural differentiation in the midbrain and anterior hindbrain through the secretion of fgf <dig>  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether hindbrain boundaries organize neuronal patterns within rhombomeres in the chick since, unlike the situation in zebrafish hindbrain  <cit> , there is no overt organization of repetitive neurogenesis or of mature neurons and glia along the ap axis within rhombomeres  <cit> . furthermore, there is normal formation of neuronal nuclei following retinoic acid treatment, surgical ablation or genetic alterations that disrupt hindbrain boundaries in chick or mouse embryos  <cit> . nevertheless, it is possible that fgfs expressed at hindbrain boundaries have roles in other aspects of tissue organization, such as axon pathfinding or formation of nerve exit points  <cit> .

what is the signal that downregulates fgf3?
an important question raised by our results is the identity of boundary signals that induce the downregulation of segmental fgf <dig> in the hindbrain. one possibility is that segmental – but not boundary – fgf <dig> expression is itself downregulated by fgf signaling from boundaries. however, on the contrary we found that addition of exogenous fgf <dig> increased the level of segmental fgf <dig> expression whereas blocking of fgf receptors inhibited fgf <dig> expression  <cit> . these results suggest that an autoregulatory positive feedback loop regulates fgf <dig> expression in the hindbrain, arguing against the possibility that fgf <dig> from boundaries downregulates its own expression in segment bodies. fgf <dig> downregulation may be mediated by the loss of follistatin from segment bodies, since both genes overlap in the hindbrain and we have recently found that fgf <dig> requires follistatin in order to be expressed in rhombomeres  <cit> . our present data are consistent with the possibility that a boundary signal downregulates segmental follistatin expression, in turn leading to downregulation of fgf <dig>  further investigations are required to elucidate which secreted boundary signals are inducing the downregulation of fgf <dig> and follistatin from rhombomeres.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrate that interference with epha <dig> signaling in the chick hindbrain prevents the formation of sharp rhombomere interfaces. in addition, boundary cell markers are lost upon overexpression of dominant negative epha <dig>  however, the segmental expression of the boundary cell marker fgf <dig> persists. similar sustained expression of fgf <dig> in rhombomeres occurs upon ablation of boundary cells or blockage of the contact between a rhombomere and its boundaries. together, we suggest that hindbrain boundary cells are required for the switching-off of rhombomeric fgf <dig>  presumably mediated by a soluble factor emanating from the boundaries. these findings imply for a new role of boundary cells in the downregulation of genes expressed at hindbrain segments. this boundary-cell activity may be required for stage-specific function of segmental genes in the developing hindbrain.
