BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  is a major etiological agent of chronic liver disease. an estimated  <dig> million humans are infected with hcv worldwide. due to similar routes of transmission, co-infection with hcv and human immunodeficiency virus- <dig>  is common, with the prevalence of co-infection ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million patients  <cit> . hcv-related liver diseases have become a major source of morbidity and mortality in hiv-1-infected patients  <cit> . once chronic infection is established, patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection have a higher rate of viral persistence, faster progression, and earlier development of end-stage liver disease, compared to hcv mono-infected patients  <cit> . infection with hiv- <dig> is associated with higher hcv viral levels in sera compared to infection with hcv alone  <cit> . however, the mechanisms that accelerate progression of hcv/hiv- <dig> co-infected patients are not fully understood.

hiv- <dig> infection enhances hcv replication, thus changing the course of hcv-related disease in co-infected patients  <cit> . hcv was originally thought to be strictly hepatotropic, while the main cell targets for hiv- <dig> infection are mononuclear leukocytes bearing cd <dig> and the chemokine receptors c-c chemokine receptor type  <dig>  and chemokine  receptor  <dig> . however, hcv can also replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , particularly in patients with hiv- <dig>  <cit> . the effect of hiv- <dig> on pbmc cultures of hcv mono-infected patients in vitro has previously been investigated. the production of hcv post-hiv infection increases by  <dig> to  <dig> logs, compared to uninfected controls  <cit> . also, hiv- <dig> facilitates replication of hcv in native human macrophages in vitro  <cit> .

the interferon γ-inducible protein  <dig>  is a chemotactic c-x-c chemokine that attracts activated t-lymphocytes and monocytes  <cit> . ip- <dig> is produced by a variety of cells, including astrocytes and hepatocytes  <cit> . increased levels of ip- <dig> have been detected in the serum and liver of hcv-infected individuals compared to controls  <cit> . elevated ip- <dig> is correlated with increased liver damage  <cit>  and hcv viral loads  <cit> , as well as enhanced ip- <dig> levels in hiv- <dig> mono-infected patients compared to controls  <cit> . increased ip- <dig> production during hiv- <dig> infection has been partially attributed to hiv- <dig> proteins, including hiv- <dig> accessory protein transactivator of transcription , in a number of cells such as astrocytes and macrophages  <cit> . serum ip- <dig> levels are higher in hiv-1/hcv co-infected patients than in hcv mono-infected patients  <cit> .

hiv- <dig> tat is a transactivating protein that contributes to the transactivation of viral and cellular genes  <cit> . extracellular tat, released from virus-infected cells, can enter neighboring infected or uninfected cells and induce its biological effects, including cytokine expression  <cit> . for example, extracellular tat stimulates il- <dig> expression in human monocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner  <cit> . also, tat upregulates the expression of specific chemokine receptors, such as ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  which are important for hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> . in addition to its regulatory role in hiv- <dig> infection, tat may activate  <cit>  and facilitate the invasion of viruses  <cit> .

ip- <dig> mrna levels in pbmcs from hiv-1/hcv co-infected and hcv mono-infected patients showed that hiv-1/hcv co-infection was associated with increased expression of ip- <dig> mrna and in the replication of hcv rna. furthermore, we used two different infectious hcv models to examine the effects of hiv- <dig> tat and ip- <dig> on hcv replication, which demonstrated that both hiv- <dig> tat and ip- <dig> activate hcv replication. also, hiv- <dig> tat activates hcv replication by upregulating ip- <dig> production. the mechanism involved in the regulation of hcv replication mediated by hiv- <dig> during co-infection is discussed.

RESULTS
ip- <dig> mrna and hcv rna levels are increased in patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection compared to hcv mono-infection
we evaluated the ip- <dig> mrna levels in pbmcs isolated from healthy individuals and hcv mono-infected and hiv-1/hcv co-infected patients. ip- <dig> mrna levels were higher in all infected patients compared to healthy control subjects, and higher in patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection than in those with hcv mono-infection . increases in serum hcv viral loads in the hiv-1/hcv co-infected group were more common than in the hcv mono-infected group  . hcv can also replicate in pbmcs  <cit> , so we compared the levels of hcv rna in pbmcs of hcv mono-infected and hiv-1/hcv co-infected patients. hcv rna levels were more than three-fold higher in hiv-1/hcv co-infected patients than in hcv mono-infected patients . these findings are consistent with other studies, demonstrating that hcv rna levels and viral loads are increased in co-infected patients  <cit> .

data are median  values, unless otherwise indicated. alt, alanine aminotransferase; ast, aspartate aminotransferase; nt, not tested

we examined correlations between ip- <dig> mrna levels and hcv rna levels in both types of patient. increased ip- <dig> levels were positively correlated with hcv rna levels in both groups .

ip- <dig> increases hcv replication in huh <dig> . <dig> cells
chemokines, which are chemotactic cytokines, play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hcv and are useful for the clinical management of patients with hepatitis c  <cit> . it is also known that chemokine cxcl- <dig>  may enhance hcv replication  <cit> .

we next examined the effects of ip- <dig> on hcv replication. huh <dig> . <dig> cells were infected with fl-j6/jfh-5'c19rluc2aubi and incubated with phosphate buffer solution , ip- <dig>  or heat-inactivated ip- <dig>  proteins. treated cells were harvested and examined for luciferase activity, which increased over time . however, luciferase activities increased from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-treatment by exposure to ip- <dig>  but not pbs or hi-ip- <dig> .

to corroborate these results, huh <dig> . <dig> cells were infected with jfh <dig> virus, a full cell culture-infectious genotype 2a hcv isolate  <cit> , and then incubated with pbs, ip- <dig>  or hi-ip- <dig>  respectively, for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days. the hcv replication levels in the cellular supernatants were measured, which showed that hcv rna copies increased over time in the presence of bsa, ip- <dig>  and hi-ip- <dig>  respectively. however, hcv rna levels were elevated at  <dig> days and peaked at  <dig> days post-treatment . the intracellular levels of hcv core protein was determined by western blot analyses, demonstrating that ip- <dig> activates hcv core protein expression from  <dig> to  <dig> days post-treatment . all of these results suggest that ip- <dig> can activate hcv replication.

having demonstrated that the addition of ip- <dig> stimulates hcv replication, we next wanted to determine whether endogenous ip- <dig> is also involved in hcv replication. we examined the effects of anti-ip- <dig> antibodies on hcv replication. huh <dig> . <dig> cells were infected with fl-j6/jfh-5'c19rluc2aubi and incubated with ip- <dig> neutralizing antibody, pbs, or msigg . ip- <dig> neutralizing antibody inhibited hcv replication . in contrast, pbs and msigg did not affect hcv replication. therefore, endogenous ip- <dig> is involved in the activation of hcv replication.

hiv- <dig> tat protein induces ip- <dig> production
hiv tat is known to induce ip- <dig> production in human astrocytes  <cit> . huh <dig> . <dig> cells were infected with or without jfh <dig> and then treated with pbs, tat, or heat-inactivated tat , respectively. ip- <dig> protein levels were detected by elisa at different times post-treatment. ip- <dig> protein levels were significantly higher in hcv-infected cells than in uninfected cells , indicating that hcv activates ip- <dig> expression. hiv- <dig> tat protein induced ip- <dig> protein production in a time-dependent manner in both hcv-infected and uninfected cells , demonstrating that tat can activate ip- <dig> protein expression.

we next measured the ip- <dig> mrna levels in huh <dig> . <dig> cells infected with or without jfh <dig> and treated with pbs, tat, or hi-tat, respectively. ip- <dig> mrna levels were higher in hcv-infected cells than in uninfected cells , indicating that hcv activates ip- <dig> gene expression. hiv- <dig> tat protein induced ip- <dig> mrna expression in a time-dependent manner in both hcv-infected and uninfected cells , suggesting that tat can activate ip- <dig> gene expression at the transcriptional level.

hiv- <dig> tat protein stimulates hcv replication
our previous study showed that tat up-regulated hcv replication using co-transfection assay  <cit> . in this study, we assessed the effects of hiv- <dig> tat protein on hcv replication in huh <dig> . <dig> cells infected with fl-j6/jfh-5'c19rluc2aubi and treated with pbs, tat, or hi-tat, respectively. the roles of tat in the regulation of hcv replication were determined by measuring luciferase activities, which showed that tat protein, but not pbs or hi-tat, activated hcv replication  <dig> h post-treatment. the hcv replication levels activated by tat peaked  <dig> h post-treatment and then declined .

we next evaluated the role of tat in the regulation of hcv replication using a second system. huh <dig> . <dig> cells infected with jfh <dig> virus were incubated with pbs, tat, or hi-tat, respectively. hcv rna copies were measured in the cell culture supernatant, which showed that hcv rna copies increased over time until  <dig> days post-treatment . the hcv rna levels were elevated in the presence of tat, but not in the presence of pbs or hi-tat , indicating that hiv- <dig> tat protein stimulates hcv rna replication. the hcv core protein levels were also measured by western blot analyses, indicating that core protein levels increased over time until  <dig> days post-treatment . in addition, hcv core protein levels were elevated in the presence of tat, but not in the presence of pbs or hi-tat , suggesting that hiv- <dig> tat protein can activate hcv core protein expression.

anti-ip- <dig> antibodies block the activation of hcv replication regulated by hiv- <dig> tat
both hiv- <dig> tat and ip- <dig> enhance hcv replication, and hiv- <dig> tat can increase ip- <dig> expression levels in hepatocytes. however, whether hiv- <dig> tat activation of hcv replication is dependent on ip- <dig> remains unknown. huh <dig> . <dig> cells infected with fl-j6/jfh-5'c19rluc2aubi were incubated with pbs, tat, tat plus msigg, or tat plus anti-ip- <dig> neutralizing antibodies. hiv- <dig> tat protein activated hcv replication in huh <dig> . <dig> cells treated with pbs or msigg, but not in cells treated with anti-ip- <dig> neutralizing antibodies . taken together, these results suggest that ip- <dig> enhances hcv replication and hiv- <dig> tat activates hcv replication by regulating ip- <dig> during hiv-1/hcv co-infection.

discussion
co-infection of hcv with hiv- <dig> is prevalent and causes increased hcv viral loads, as well as increased morbidity in co-infected individuals  <cit> . the precise molecular mechanism by which hiv- <dig> increases hcv persistence and accelerates liver fibrosis is unknown. chemokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of both hcv and hiv- <dig> infections. also, hiv- <dig> tat protein is known to activate hcv replication by upregulating ip- <dig> production.

elevated ip- <dig> levels have been detected in hcv-infected patients compared to healthy controls  <cit> . this association is supported by the positive correlation between ip- <dig> levels and hcv viral load, as well as the significant decrease in ip- <dig> levels after clearance of hcv infection  <cit> . elevated ip- <dig> mrna levels were detected in hcv mono-infected patients compared to healthy controls. also, increased ip- <dig> mrna levels were associated with increased hcv rna levels in hcv-infected patients. this indicates that ip- <dig> plays an important role in the natural pathogenesis of hcv-induced liver damage. furthermore, ip- <dig> promotes hiv- <dig> replication in monocyte-derived macrophages and peripheral blood lymphocytes  <cit> . however, the effect of ip- <dig> on hcv replication is not well understood. ip- <dig> upregulates hcv replication in hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner. treatment with an ip-10-specific monoclonal antibody reduces hcv replication in huh <dig> . <dig> cells, demonstrating that endogenous ip- <dig> stimulates hcv replication.

previous studies have reported that ip- <dig> levels are elevated in hiv- <dig> mono-infected patients compared to healthy control subjects  <cit> , and that ip- <dig> stimulates hiv- <dig> replication  <cit> . significantly higher serum ip- <dig> levels have been reported in hiv-1/hcv co-infected patients than in mono-infected and uninfected control groups  <cit> . this suggests that ip- <dig> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hiv-1/hcv co-infection. however, no reports are available on the role of ip- <dig> in the regulation of hiv-1/hcv co-infection. initially, we measured the ip- <dig> mrna levels in pbmcs from a healthy, hcv mono-infected, and hiv-1/hcv co-infected group. hiv-1/hcv co-infection was associated with significantly increased ip- <dig> mrna expression in pbmcs compared to hcv mono-infection, suggesting that hiv- <dig> enhances ip- <dig> expression in hcv/hiv- <dig> co-infected patients.

the transactivating effects of tat are not limited to hiv-1-infected cells because extracellular tat is secreted into the plasma of hiv-1-infected patients where it can exert its effects on uninfected cells  <cit> . extracellular tat non-specifically binds to cell membranes and is internalized, which may induce intracellular signals that ultimately change cellular gene expression. for example, tat upregulates the expression of a number of cytokines   <cit>  and chemokines   <cit> . hiv- <dig> tat also induces ip- <dig> in astrocytes  <cit> . our results corroborate these findings because ip- <dig> expression was increased in huh <dig> . <dig> cells in the presence of hiv- <dig> tat. also, hcv infection upregulates ip- <dig> expression in huh <dig> . <dig> cells. this is consistent with in vivo findings that demonstrated that ip- <dig> mrna levels were higher in hcv-infected patients than in healthy controls. we found that tat activates ip- <dig> expression and hcv replication, and that ip- <dig> upregulates hcv replication in two infectious hcv models. treatment with an anti-ip- <dig> monoclonal antibody reduced tat-activated hcv replication, demonstrating that tat enhancement of hcv replication is dependent on ip- <dig>  tat has been implicated in the activation of cytokine transforming growth factor -β in hiv-1-infected cells and in the stimulation of jc virus  gene transcription and dna replication in oligodendroglia, the primary central nervous system cell type infected by jcv in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  <cit> . tat also activates kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  lytic cycle replication from latency, in part by modulating janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathways, and promotes ks progression  <cit> . hiv- <dig> transactivator protein tat, produced by hiv-1-infected cells, is secreted into the extracellular matrix where it activates a complex cascade of signaling pathways and alters the intrahepatic chemokine environment, particularly chemokine ip- <dig>  this contributes to the activation of hcv replication and accelerates liver fibrosis observed in patients co-infected with hiv- <dig> and hcv. the increased level of ip- <dig> induction in pbmcs from hiv-1-infected individuals may allow for the establishment of more aggressive hcv infection. the downregulation of anti-hcv responses allow for increased hcv replication and higher hcv viral loads. tat activation of ip- <dig> may promote hiv- <dig> immunosuppression and stimulate hcv gene transcription. elevated ip- <dig> levels in hcv mono-infected patients are correlated with increased liver disease. the increased ip- <dig> levels in hcv/hiv-coinfected patients may explain the accelerated progression to liver disease in these individuals. ip- <dig> expression is also associated with immunological treatment failure following haart  <cit> . therefore, reducing ip- <dig> expression and function may enhance the effectiveness of current anti-retroviral treatments.

CONCLUSIONS
hiv-1/hcv co-infection is associated with a significant increase in the expression of ip- <dig> mrna in pbmcs. hcv rna levels were higher in pbmcs of patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection than in those with hcv mono-infection. hiv- <dig> tat or ip- <dig> activates hcv replication in a time-dependent manner. also, hiv- <dig> tat induces ip- <dig> production. in addition, the effect of hiv- <dig> tat on hcv replication was blocked by anti-ip- <dig> monoclonal antibody, demonstrating that the effect of hiv- <dig> tat on hcv replication depends on ip- <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that hiv- <dig> tat protein activates hcv replication by upregulating the production of the chemokine ip- <dig>  thus, ip- <dig> may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with hiv-1/hcv co-infection. further work is necessary to determine the intermediary pathways responsible for the effects on hcv replication. our study increases the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the co-infection of two deadly viruses, hiv- <dig> and hcv.
