BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. the establishment of p. gingivalis at a periodontal site and progression of disease is dependent on the ability of the bacterium to utilize essential nutrients, of which iron  plays a crucial role. p. gingivalis lacks the majority of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for the porphyrin ring, hence it is unable to synthesize protoporphyrin ix, the precursor of heme  <cit> ; and unlike other gram-negative bacteria, p. gingivalis does not produce siderophores  <cit> . although several studies have shown that p. gingivalis acquires heme from the host environment using gingipains, lipoproteins and specific outer-membrane receptors  <cit> , the precise mechanisms by which p. gingivalis acquires heme are still unknown.

the gene encoding the p. gingivalis outer membrane 40-kda protein  was first cloned by abiko et al.  <cit> . as the recombinant omp <dig> protein was demonstrated to exhibit hemin binding ability, and the molecular mass of the mature polypeptide determined by mass spectrometric analysis was  <dig>  kda, the protein was designated as hbp <dig>  <cit> . however, characterization of the hbp <dig> gene at the transcriptional and translational levels in p. gingivalis and contribution of hbp <dig> protein to hemin utilization have not been elucidated.

hbp <dig> protein has unique characteristics including the presence of one thioredoxin-like motif and a conserved c-terminal domain. recently, it has been reported that the c-terminal domain of a group of p. gingivalis outer membrane proteins plays a crucial role in the coordinated process of exportation and attachment of those proteins onto the cell surface  <cit>  and that some of the c-terminal domain containing proteins, including rgpb, are glycosylated  <cit> . the last five residues of the c-terminal domain are well conserved not only in p. gingivalis but also in other oral pathogens, and that the last two c-terminal residues  of rgpb have been shown to be essential for correct transport and posttranslational modification  <cit> . however, the transportation and posttranslational modification mechanisms of c-terminal domain containing proteins other than rgpb remain poorly understood.

in this study, we presented the first evidence that the hbp <dig> gene produces three translational products in p. gingivalis. one was a 40-kda protein that was transported to the outer membrane and glycosylated on the cell surface, resulting in diffuse proteins with molecular masses of 50- <dig> kda. the others were smaller truncated 29- and 27-kda proteins. we constructed hbp35-deficient mutants to elucidate the role of the gene products in this microorganism and found that the hbp <dig> protein  exhibited thioredoxin activity and bound hemin and that its c-terminal domain was involved in its transport to the outer membrane. the protein was also essential for growth of the bacterium in a hemin-depleted environment.

RESULTS
immunoblot analysis of p. gingivalis hbp <dig> mutants with anti-hbp <dig> antibody
to gain insights into the biological significance of hbp <dig> in p. gingivalis, hbp35-deficient mutants, which had full length deletion of, or insertion in, the hbp <dig> gene, were constructed from the wild-type strain  <dig>  immunoblot analysis with an anti-hbp <dig> antibody revealed that whole cell extracts of p. gingivalis  <dig> showed three protein bands with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda and diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda . no protein bands other than those of  <dig> and  <dig> kda indicated by asterisks, which might be non-specific, were detected in the hbp <dig> full length deletion mutant , whereas the hbp <dig> insertion mutant , which had an insertion of the ermf-ermam dna cassette just upstream of the f <dig> residue within the hbp <dig> protein, showed 29-and 27-kda proteins . we checked independent  <dig> isolates of kdp <dig> and  <dig> isolates of kdp <dig>  all of the isolates showed the same results as shown in figure  <dig>  the 40-kda protein appeared as the full length gene product of hbp <dig>  which coincided with results of previous studies  <cit> .

pigmentation and gingipain activities of p. gingivalis hbp <dig> mutants
both full length deletion and insertion p. gingivalis hbp <dig> mutants formed black pigmented colonies on blood agar plates. no difference was observed in rgp, kgp and hemagglutinating activities between the hbp <dig> mutants and the wild type . these results suggest that hbp <dig> does not influence expression of gingipain-encoding genes.

northern blot analysis of hbp35
to determine whether the hbp <dig> gene produces multiple transcripts, total rnas were prepared from the wild type and hbp <dig> mutants. northern blot analysis was then carried out with an hbp <dig> dna probe that hybridized to the hbp <dig> region coding for q22-p <dig>  the wild type showed a  <dig> -kb transcript hybridizing to the hbp <dig> probe . in the hbp <dig> insertion and full length deletion mutants, there was no  <dig> -kb transcript, indicating that the  <dig> -kb mrna was produced from the hbp <dig> gene. the hbp <dig> insertion mutant produced transcripts with  <dig> - <dig>  kb that hybridized to the probe. the ermf probe hybridized to transcripts with similar length in the hbp <dig> insertion mutant .

subcellular localization of hbp <dig> protein
in an approach to understand the potential roles of hbp <dig> proteins with different molecular masses, we fractionated cells of the wild type and the hbp <dig> insertion mutant into cytoplasm/periplasm, total membrane, and inner and outer membrane fractions. these fractions were subjected to sds-page and immunoblot analysis with the anti-hbp <dig> antibody. the diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins were mainly detected in the outer membrane fraction, whereas the 40-kda protein was detected in every fraction of the wild type but mainly in the inner membrane fraction. the 29-and 27-kda proteins were mainly detected in the cytoplasm/periplasm fraction of the wild type and hbp <dig> insertion mutant .

peptide mass fingerprint analysis of the 27-kda protein
to determine whether the 27-kda protein is a truncated form of the hbp <dig> protein, an immunoprecipitation experiment using the hbp <dig> insertion mutant  cell lysate was carried out with the anti-hbp <dig> antibody. the resulting immunoprecipitate contained a 27-kda protein band , which was digested with trypsin followed by maldi-tof mass spectrometric analysis. the 27-kda protein was found to be derived from a 3'-portion of hbp <dig>  with pmf sequence coverage of 37% of full length protein . the maximum mass error among the identified  <dig> tryptic peptides was  <dig> ppm. since the detected tryptic peptide located at the most n-terminal region of hbp <dig> starts from g <dig> and since the insertion site of the ermf-ermam dna cassette in the insertion mutant is just upstream of f <dig>  it is feasible that the 27-kda protein uses m <dig> or m <dig> as the alternative translation initiation site.

identification of the n-terminal amino acid residue of truncated hbp <dig> proteins
to clarify the n-terminal amino acid residue of the truncated hbp <dig> proteins, we introduced amino acid substitution mutations of  or/and  to the hbp <dig> insertion mutant  producing the 29-and 27-kda hbp <dig> proteins . as shown in figure 3b, the 27-kda protein was not observed in the hbp <dig>  insertion mutant , while the 29-kda protein was not observed in the hbp <dig>  insertion mutant , suggesting that m <dig> and m <dig> are the n-terminal amino acid residues of the 29-and 27-kda proteins, respectively. the use of m <dig> and m <dig> as alternative translation initiation sites was supported by the finding that no hbp <dig> translational product was detected in the hbp <dig>  insertion mutant . moreover, recombinant hbp <dig> proteins with a c-terminal histidine-tag were produced in an e. coli strain expressing the hbp <dig> gene and purified by a histidine-tag purification system. immunoblot analysis revealed that the purified products contained 40-, 29-, and 27-kda proteins immunoreactive to the anti-hbp <dig> anitibody. edman sequencing revealed that the n-terminal amino acid residue of the recombinant 27-kda protein was m <dig> .

hemin binding site of rhbp <dig> proteins
shibata et al.  <cit>  found that a purified rhbp <dig> protein  could bind hemin and that hbp <dig> was suggested to possess a putative heme binding sequence . to determine the hemin binding region of hbp <dig>  we constructed and purified rhbp <dig> , rhbp <dig>  and truncated rhbp <dig>  proteins with n-terminal histidine-tags using a histidine-tag purification system and carried out hemin binding assays using a hemoprotein peroxidase assay. as shown in figure 4b, all of the rhbp <dig> , rhbp <dig>  and truncated rhbp <dig>  proteins were found to have hemin binding ability, implying that the hemin binding site is located in m135-p <dig> of hbp <dig> protein.

effect of hemin depletion on growth of the hbp <dig> mutant
since hbp <dig> protein is a hemin-binding protein, we determined the contribution of hbp <dig> proteins to acquisition or intracellular storage of heme. the hbp <dig> insertion mutant, the full length deletion mutant, the complemented strain which was constructed by replacing the intact hbp <dig> gene into the hbp <dig> full length deletion mutant, and the wild-type strain were hemin-starved after being grown in enriched bhi broth containing hemin . hemin starvation resulted in retardation of the growth of the hbp <dig> mutants compared to that of the wild type, whereas the complemented strain partially recovered the growth retardation of the hbp <dig> deletion mutant under the hemin-depleted condition. even under the hemin replete condition, the hbp <dig> mutants grew more slowly than the wild type, suggesting that hbp <dig> plays a role in hemin utilization in a sufficient hemin concentration .

thioredoxin activity of rhbp <dig> proteins
shiroza et al.  <cit>  have shown that an hbp <dig> gene-containing plasmid complemented the defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity of an e. coli dsba mutant. this finding indicates that hbp <dig> is exported to the periplasm in a dsba mutant and plays a role in the disulfide bond formation  <cit> . the hbp <dig> protein has a thioredoxin motif in the n-terminal region. we performed an insulin reduction assay to determine whether hbp <dig> has thioredoxin activity. reduction of disulfide bonds of insulin by thioredoxin activity generates free a and b chains of insulin, and the resulting b chain is precipitated, which can be measured by the increase in turbidity  <cit> . the reducing activity of rhbp <dig>  was higher than that of e. coli thioredoxin, whereas no activity was detected in rhbp <dig> , indicating that hbp <dig> protein exhibits thioredoxin activity and that the two cysteine residues  are crucial for this activity .

diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins are associated with anionic polysaccharide
nguyen et al.  <cit>  revealed glycosylation of rgpb by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody  that recognizes the anionic polysaccharide of a-lps  <cit> . to determine whether hbp <dig> is glycosylated, we carried out an immunoprecipitation experiment. immunoprecipitates from the protein extracts of kdp <dig>  with an anti-hbp <dig> rabbit polyclonal antibody contained the 40-kda protein and diffuse proteins of 50- <dig> kda, which were revealed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-hbp <dig> mouse monoclonal antibody   <cit> . the diffuse proteins of 50- <dig> kda immunoreacted with mab 1b <dig>  indicating that hbp <dig> is associated with anionic polysaccharide on the cell surface . it is likely that the diffuse bands are hbp <dig> proteins binding to anionic polysaccharides with different numbers of repeating units.

no diffuse bands were detected when the last five c-terminal residues of hbp <dig> were deleted
as hbp <dig> contains the c-terminal domain motif that may play a role in export and cell surface attachment, and that the presence of diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins is similar to that of rgpb  <cit> , it is possible that hbp <dig> is transported to the outer membrane and anchored to the cell surface by the same transport system as rgpb. nguyen et al.  <cit>  reported that the last five c-terminal residues  of rgpb play a significant role in the post-translational modification/proteolytic processing and exportation of proteins to the outer membrane. to determine whether the last five c-terminal residues  of hbp <dig> play a role similar to that of rgpb, we constructed an hbp <dig> deletion of k340-p <dig> mutant and found that the mutant showed no diffuse bands but only 33-and 31-kda proteins, which may have been generated by degradation of hbp <dig> protein accumulating in the cell . the result suggests that the last five c-terminal residues have an important role in the transport of hbp <dig> protein to the cell surface.

discussion
as p. gingivalis requires heme as the source of iron and protoporphyrin ix, a heme binding and transport system is essential for the microorganism to survive. recently, several tonb-linked outer membrane receptors for heme utilization, including hmur, tlr, ihta and hemr, have been reported  <cit> . the ability to store heme in bacterial cells appears to provide a nutritional advantage for survival of the bacterium in the iron-limited environment of a healthy gingival crevice  <cit> . in fact, heme can bind the p. gingivalis cell surface and may then be transported into the cell by an energy-dependent process  <cit> . shibata et al.  <cit>  found that purified rhbp <dig> protein  could bind hemin but not hemoglobin or lactoferrin. hbp <dig> was suggested to possess a putative heme binding sequence , however, we found in this study that hemin could bind the mutant rhbp <dig>  and the truncated rhbp <dig>  , indicating that the hemin binding site is located between m <dig> and p <dig>  the hbp <dig> mutants grew more slowly than the wild type in hemin-depleted conditions and even in the condition with a sufficient hemin concentration , indicating that hbp <dig> protein plays a role in hemin utilization in various hemin levels.

the truncated hbp <dig> proteins of 27-and 29-kda, which were derived from a 3'-portion of the hbp <dig> gene, were mainly located in the cytoplasm/periplasm fraction. this finding together with the fact that there is no signal peptide region in the two proteins suggests that these proteins are located in the cytoplasm and contribute to the intracellular storage of heme as does bacterioferritin . similar protein expression has been found in neisseria meningitidis: two forms of pilb protein are produced from the pilb gene. one is secreted to the outer membrane as a whole polypeptide with methionine sulfoxide reductase  a and b activities, and the other is a truncated form lacking an n-terminal thioredoxin domain, which is generated from an internal aug initiation codon and is located in the cytoplasm  <cit> .

hiratsuka et al.  <cit>  have previously reported that hbp <dig> shows no significant similarity with any other known proteins. as the truncated rhbp <dig>  protein has hemin binding activity, h204-h <dig>  h252-h <dig>  and h <dig> within the truncated protein may interact with heme, in a similar fashion to the myoglobin and hemoglobin heme pockets in which two histidines hold heme through interaction with the central iron atom  <cit> .

recently, dashper et al.  <cit>  reported that expression of the hbp <dig> gene in strain w <dig> was not induced under a hemin-limited condition. we also observed that expression of the hbp <dig> gene in  <dig> was not induced under hemin-depleted conditions . although hmur, which is one of the hemin receptors, has been found to be regulated by one transcriptional activator  <cit> , it seems unlikely that expression of the hbp <dig> gene is regulated by a specific transcriptional activator under hemin-depleted conditions.

physiological roles of thioredoxins  in p. gingivalis have not been established. in general, the intracellular environment is maintained in a reduced condition because of the presence of small proteins with redox-active cysteine residues, including trxs, glutaredoxins , monocysteine tripeptide glutathione  and other low-molecular-weight thiols  <cit> . in this regard, analysis of the p. gingivalis  <dig> and w <dig> genome sequences revealed the presence of thioredoxin reductase , thioredoxin homologue , and  <dig> thioredoxin family proteins , pgn <dig>  and pgn <dig> in  <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig> , pg <dig>  pg <dig>  and pg <dig> in w83), and the absence of grx, γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine-synthase and gsh synthetase. recently, it has been shown that bacteroides fragilis, which is phylogenetically close to p. gingivalis, possesses the trxb/trx system as the only reductive system for oxidative stress  <cit> . we previously showed that the thioredoxin protein  was increased when cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen  <cit> . although physiological roles of the thioredoxin domain of hbp <dig> protein are unknown at present, the diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins, which contain the thioredoxin domain and are located on the outer membrane, may contribute to the maintenance of the redox status of the cell surface. however, we have not obtained a positive result indicating that hbp <dig> protein plays a role in protection against oxidative stresses so far.

amino acid sequences in the rgpb that are necessary for transport of the protein to the outer membrane have been reported  <cit> . when recombinant truncated rgpb lacking its c-terminal  <dig> residues was produced in p. gingivalis, there was an altered distribution of the protein in the culture supernatant and periplasm. seers et al.  <cit>  reported the importance of the c-terminal domain of rgpb for attachment to the outer membrane and suggested that the domain is involved in a coordinated process of export and attachment to the cell surface. nguyen et al.  <cit>  found that the last five c-terminal residues of rgpb are conserved in a number of proteins of not only p. gingivalis but also other periodontal pathogens such as prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia and that they have an important role in mediating correct folding of the nascent protein, which is then transported across the periplasm to be fully glycosylated during its translocation across or on the outer membrane for anchorage to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. the last five c-terminal residues of hbp <dig>  contain a stretch of polar-hydrophobic residues as well as those of rgpb . we found in this study that the diffuse bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins, which were the main products of the hbp <dig> gene in the wild type, disappeared in the mutant strain lacking the last five c-terminal residues of hbp <dig>  suggesting that, like rgpb, the c-terminal region of hbp <dig> plays an important role in transport of hbp <dig> to the outer membrane and anchorage to the membrane. very recently, we found a novel protein secretion system  in bacteria such as p. gingivalis belonging to phylum bacteroidetes and suggested that the secretion system uses the c-terminal domain as a transportation signal  <cit> . hbp <dig> may therefore be transported to the cell surface via this secretion system.

the diffuse hbp <dig> protein bands of 50- <dig> kda were immunoreactive with aps-recognizing mab 1b <dig>  indicating that a part of hbp <dig> protein is glycosylated, which is coordinated with the process of export. rangarajan et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that the anionic polysaccharide is associated with lipid a and they therefore renamed it lps with aps repeating unit . hbp <dig> therefore as well as rgpb may be glycosylated on the cell surface by attachment to a-lps.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that the hbp <dig> gene produced a  <dig> -kb transcript and several translational products;  a 40-kda hbp <dig>  which was derived from the whole hbp <dig> gene, was mainly located in the inner membrane,  29-and 27-kda hbp <dig> proteins were n-terminal-truncated products lacking the signal peptide sequence and the thioredoxin domain and were mainly located in the cytoplasm, and  diffuse hbp <dig> bands of 50- <dig> kda proteins were glycosylated and located on the outer membrane. analysis of these hbp <dig> proteins revealed that they played a significant role in heme acquisition. the last five c-terminal residues of hbp <dig> were crucial for the secretion to the outer membrane.
