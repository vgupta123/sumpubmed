BACKGROUND
apomixis, or asexual reproduction through seeds, is a naturally occurring reproductive form which has been observed in more than  <dig> plant species. apomictic reproduction is, however, absent in many agriculturally important crop plants  <cit> . it therefore represents a potentially important agricultural tool, since introduction of apomixis into crops could be an effective way to fix and propagate a given genotype for superior crop performance. apomixis has evolved from many different sexual taxa  <cit> , although the genetic factors underlying apomictic reproduction remain unknown.

the genus boechera  is monophyletic, has a basic chromosome number × =  <dig>  <cit> , and wild populations are characterized by diploid sexuals, and diploid, aneuploid, and polyploid  apomicts  <cit> . plants of this genus are perennial members of the brassicaceae which are distributed throughout north america and greenland  <cit> . the switch from sexual to apomictic reproduction has been hypothesized to arise via de-regulation of the developmental pathways originally leading to sexual seed formation  <cit> . as virtually all asexual plants or animals are hybrid and/or polyploid, their associated gene regulatory changes have been proposed as possible triggers for the switch in reproductive mode  <cit> . in particular, the potential function of micrornas , which are known to play crucial roles in many aspects of plant development, remains to be determined with regards to the switch from sex to apomixis.

mirnas are 20- <dig> nucleotide small endogenous non-protein-coding regulatory rna sequences that are produced by genes distinct from the genes that they regulate. evidence provided by allen et al  <cit>  and felippes et al  <cit>  show that some mirnas evolved by inverted duplications of target gene sequences, whereas others originated from random sequences that either have self-complementarity by chance or sequences that represent highly eroded inverted duplications. since their discovery, several mirnas have been computationally and/or experimentally identified and characterized in different species. a number of studies have shown that mirnas play key roles in regulatory functions of gene expression for most eukaryotes  <cit> , mainly at the post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . several recent findings have implicated mirnas in a number of biological mechanisms including leaf  <cit> , stem  <cit>  and root growth  <cit> , floral organ identity, control of female gamete formation and reproductive development  <cit> , auxin signaling  <cit> , and biotic and abiotic stress response  <cit> .

biogenesis of mirnas involves nucleolytic processing of a precursor transcript with extensive foldback structure  <cit> . mirnas are initially expressed as part of longer transcripts that are self-complementary foldback hairpin structures termed primary mirnas . pri-mirna precursors are transcribed by mirna genes which are mostly independent transcript units. these pri-mirna precursors are first processed into pre-mirnas from which mirnas are eventually generated by the ribonuclease iii nucleases and dicer-like <dig>  in plants. subsequently, the mature single stranded mirna is incorporated into a mirna-induced silencing complex  to cleave its specific target messenger rna , or to effect translational attenuation of its target transcript  <cit> . plant mirnas bind to the protein-coding region of their target mrnas to induce target mrna degradation via an rnai-like mechanism where an argonaut  protein cleaves the mirna-mrna duplex, thereby repressing expression of that particular mrna  <cit> . it is also known that gene repression can be effected by translational inhibition through deadenylation of the 3' poly  tail and decapping of the 5' end in mrnas, which leads to progressive mrna decay and degradation  <cit> .

accurate detection and expression profiling of mirnas will enable a better understanding of their role in plant growth and development  <cit> , and could provide insights into mirna-mediated apomictic gene regulatory mechanisms. the main approaches for mirna identification have been widely undertaken by computational prediction, direct cloning and sequencing. until recently, most sequence information including expressed sequence tags  or genome survey sequences  used for computational prediction of mirnas were generated by traditional sanger sequencing methods  <cit> . compared to highly conserved mirnas, less- or non-conserved mirnas are often expressed at lower levels, thus making their detection more daunting using small-scale sequencing. the development of next generation sequencing technology has greatly improved the capacity to identify low abundance or tissue-specific mirnas, and has enhanced the discovery of several conserved, non-conserved or lowly expressed mirnas through cloning and deep sequencing of small rna and transcriptome libraries in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , triticum aestivum , solanum lycopersicum , oryza sativa , populus trichocarpa , and manihot esculenta   <cit> . to date, many varieties of mirnas are reported in plants, animals, and even microbes  <cit> .

although mirnas have been studied in plants for years, no extensive study has yet been performed on boechera. the objective of this work was thus to identify and completely catalogue conserved plant mirnas, and to compare the expression pattern of their target genes in the floral tissues of sexual and apomictic boechera, in order to shed light on the potential role of mirnas in the switch from sexual to apomictic reproduction. to do so we have cloned, sequenced and validated conserved mirnas using bioinformatics and microarray techniques, and have analyzed these data using sexual and apomictic est libraries  and comparative expression profiles between microdissected ovules from sexual and apomictic genotypes  <cit> .

RESULTS
homology of mirnas to boechera ests
the blastn search using a reference set of  <dig> non-redundant known conserved plant mirnas against flower-specific sexual and apomictic boechera est libraries led to the identification of  <dig> sexual and  <dig> apomictic transcripts with high homology to mirnas of other plant species . of these,  <dig> sexual and  <dig> apomictic transcripts could fold back into stable hairpins containing conserved mirnas . many est sequences were found that could not fold back into stem loops, although it is unclear whether this was due to the fact that they were not pre-mirnas or whether this was due to sequencing errors introduced by the  <dig> flx system. predominantly, the less conserved mirna families  matched a small number of cdna sequences which in most cases were found to be truncated precursor sequences in the est libraries, and thus could not fold into stable stem-loops .

bioinformatically-identified conserved mirna families
in all,  <dig> mirna families across  <dig> plant species were found to match at least one boechera  <dig> est read, with a. thaliana being the predominant species . conserved plant mirna families in boechera were identified to a large extent based upon high homology with reported conserved a. thaliana mirnas . in cases where boechera and a. thaliana did not share particular mirna families, a search for conserved mirna families was performed in other plant species. the predominant mirna families which shared similarity with the highest number of boechera  <dig> reads were mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . it was observed also that the boechera mirnas exhibit a wide variation in the length of pre-mirna sequences .  <dig> families were found to be common between the sexual and apomictic genotypes. of these,  <dig> mature mirnas  were similar in sequence, whereas  <dig> were different in sequence constitution due to nucleotide differences between the two reproductive modes. these included mirnas mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . pre-mirna lengths varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with most between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, a length similar to that of pre-mirnas in other species. the location of the mature mirnas in the precursor pre-mirnas also varied among the mirna families. in  <dig> pre-mirnas, the mirnas were found in the 3' arm while  <dig> were in the 5' arm of the stem-loop hairpin structures .

evaluation of the pre-mirnas was also based on a+u content. the mirna precursors have a+u content ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % , similar to proportions observed in other plant species  <cit> . consistent with general notion, the majority of identified boechera mirna precursors contain more a+u nucleotides than g+c  <cit> . it is also important to note that the formation of a stem-loop structure is not a unique feature of mirnas, since other rnas such as mrna, rrna, and trna can also form similar structures. for this reason, uniform systems for annotating new mirnas comprising negative minimal fold energy , adjusted minimal fold energy  and the minimal fold energy index  have been developed  <cit>  and have become generally accepted. zhang et al  <cit>  indicated that most identified mirna precursors have an mfei greater than  <dig> , which is much higher than in trna , rrna , or mrna . however, a number of pre-mirnas with lower mfeis have been reported, provided the number of nucleotide substitutions in the particular conserved mirna compared with other species does not exceed three .

microarray analysis of conserved mirna families
the mirnas identified from cdna sequencing of floral tissues, using the bioinformatics described above, were further verified using a proprietary microarray analysis with lc sciences, in order to validate their expression in sexual and apomictic boechera flower tissues. the lc sciences proprietary mirna microarray chip that was used was designed by spotting all known plant mirnas that were available in the mirbase release  <dig>  and the plant mirna database, pmrd . subsequently hybridization was performed as described in methods using isolated enriched boechera small rnas to confirm expressed conserved mirnas. as expected, most  mature mirnas representing  <dig> mirna families were identified to be conserved mainly compared to a. thaliana. the microarray assay confirmed  <dig> conserved families identified with the bioinformatics techniques. it is also noteworthy that  <dig> and  <dig> other mirna families were respectively detected separately by the microarray and bioinformatics approaches .

boechera-specific mirna nucleotide substitutions  enhance pre-mirna stem-loop stability
the stability of a secondary structure is quantified as the amount of free energy released or used by forming base pairs. the more negative the free energy of a structure, the more likely is formation of that structure and its stability, because more stored energy is released, and this principle is used to predict the secondary structure of a particular sequence  <cit> . out of the  <dig> stable boechera pre-mirna stem-loop structures obtained,  <dig> contain mirnas with nucleotide substitutions  when compared with corresponding arabidopsis or other plant mirnas. the frequency of a, c and g substitutions were similar between sexual and apomictic mature mirnas, while u appeared to show a higher rate of substitution in the apomictic mature mirnas . considering that a single nucleotide change in the sequence of a target site can affect mirna regulation, ns could conceivably be under selection pressure to enhance the conformation and thermodynamic stability of the pre-mirna stem-loop structure. we thus examined whether these boechera-specific nucleotide changes had any effect on the structure and thermodynamic stability of their corresponding pre-mirnas.

to do this, all pre-mirnas containing mirna nss were selected from the various identified mirna families . for each pre-mirna sequence, the gibbs free energy  was calculated using the mfold web server  <cit> . importantly, the Δg comparison was done between a pre-mirna with the boechera-specific mirna sequence, and the same pre-mirna with the mirna sequence of  arabidopsis, in other words "correcting" the nss in the boechera mirna. in most cases, the boechera-specific pre-mirna showed significantly higher  thermodynamic stability  than that of the pre-mirna containing the "corrected" nucleotide substitution . similarly, when the corresponding pre-mirnas in arabidopsis/oryza were "corrected" to boechera mirnas, most of the arabidopsis/oryza "new pre-mirna" versions showed significantly lower  thermodynamic stability compared to the natural pre-mirnas .

in all, this nucleotide substitution-stability phenomenon was most common in our analyses of both apomictic  and sexual boechera , in addition to arabidopsis . naturally occurring mirna nss thus appear to confer optimal thermodynamic stability on pre-mirna stem-loop structures in boechera, and is consistent with similar analyses in other plants. for example, a similar comparison of the Δg of predicted secondary structures of two variants of barley mir <dig> precursor with a c and a g in the 13th position showed differences in stability between the variants  <cit> . interestingly, thakur et al  <cit>  reported that species background may also be correlated with the calculation of both the minimum free energy and mirna hairpin stability, although this difference appeared to be manifested at the level of mono- and dicots. thus, at least with respect to the comparisons between closely related boechera and arabidopsis used here, our data imply that natural selection has guided sequence variation in these regulatory elements.

in one case pre-mirna stability was also manifested on the intraspecific level, comparing sexual and apomictic boechera. in the family mir <dig>  the pre-mirna of the sexual boechera species has the same mirna sequence as in arabidopsis, however that of the apomictic species shows one c to a ns change at position seven . the pre-mirna stability was examined by introducing the apomictic ns into the sexual sequence at the same position and Δgs compared. as expected there was a decrease in the negative Δg by  <dig>  kcal/mol in the "new" sexual pre-mirna with the introduced apomictic nss, suggesting that the sexual pre-mirna is perhaps at its optimal thermodynamic stable state. this final evidence is consistent with trans-acting regulatory differences between sexual and apomictic ovules, the result of sequence variation in regulatory factors in the sexual  versus apomictic  genomes, as suggested by sharbel et al  <cit> .

conserved boechera mirnas target many transcription factors 
the blast analyses here have revealed many potential regulatory gene targets. consistent with the results of functional studies in other plant species, such as arabidopsis, rice and corn  <cit> , the majority  of target proteins in boechera are transcription factors . transcription factors  have been estimated in rice to be about 70% of conserved mirna targets, while in wheat it has been predicted to be 35%  <cit> . the other targets are mostly associated with plant metabolism, development, signal transduction and response to environmental stress including cold, salinity, drought and nutritional deficiency  <cit> .



the est libraries from which the boechera mirnas were mined were flower-specific  <cit> , and expectedly, a number of identified tf-targeting mirnas have been associated with flower development in other species. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the homologues of the squamosa-promoter binding proteins and whose function is well conserved across plant species  <cit> , were identified in both apomictic and sexual boechera . in arabidopsis these tf regulatory mirnas have been reported to regulate the antirrhinum floral meristem identity squamosa promoter binding protein-like  genes  <cit> . other tf regulatory mirna families which have regulatory roles during flower development in other species were also identified , including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which have been implicated in the control of lfy expression, floral organ identity, and flowering time  <cit> . mir <dig> has furthermore been reported to regulate stem cell fate, and defines the inner boundary of the apetala <dig> and pistillata expression domains in arabidopsis floral meristems  <cit> .

a number of well-defined tf targeting mirnas were also identified in boechera. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  are associated with post-transcriptional regulation of the a. thaliana auxin response transcription factor  family genes  <cit> . mir <dig> is known to regulate the expression of tcp transcription factor genes whose down-regulations cause abnormalities in leaf development  <cit> . vierstra  <cit>  showed that mir <dig> regulates the messages of f-box proteins, which in turn target specific proteins for proteolysis by making them substrates for ubiquitination by scf e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. growth regulating factor genes, the targets of the mir <dig> family, are putative transcription factors that regulate cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon  <cit> . argonaute, one of the important proteins in the regulation of mirna biogenesis, is a target of mir <dig> whereas mir <dig> regulates a copper ion binding protein. the mir <dig> family regulates a number of other genes including the transcription factors, transducin family protein/wd- <dig> repeat family protein and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-type family protein.

expression patterns of transcription factor  targets and apomixis in boechera
the switch from sexual to apomictic seed production is hypothesized to involve global regulatory changes during ovule development which are induced by hybridization and/or polyploidy  <cit> , both common characteristics of apomictic plants and parthenogenetic animals. using data from a previously-published supersage analysis  <cit> , the ovule expression patterns of putative target tfs for the mirnas identified here were compared between sexual and apomictic boechera across four ovule developmental stages. of the  <dig> tfs identified as potential mirna targets, expression data for  <dig> were found in the supersage libraries, including: the squamosa promoter binding protein like spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig>  myb domain protein  <dig> , rap <dig> , toe <dig> rap <dig>   dna binding and tcp <dig> , which are targets of the mirna families mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> respectively.

it is noteworthy that, whereas the other genes showed no significant differential expression levels between sexual and apomictic species, spl <dig> was found to be significantly  up-regulated at the stage two of ovule development in apomictic species in all libraries studied . spl <dig> also showed low level expression in all the other apomictic ovule stages and at only stage two of the sexual ovules. using six apomictic and five sexual genotypes of boechera, the differential expression of spl <dig> at ovule stage two of floral development was further validated using quantitative real time-pcr. with the exception of a single sexual b. divaricarpa from mule ranch, montana, all apomictic accessions clearly showed relatively higher expression of spl <dig> than the sexuals , result which is consistent with the expression pattern observed with the spl <dig> supersage tag . the single sexual outlier  for slp <dig> implies that the expression pattern of this tf may not be a key factor associated with apomixis expression, but rather is associated with dna sequence variation in regulatory factors in the hybrid b. divaricarpa. alternatively, population-level variation for tf expression could be associated with the penetrance of the apomictic phenotype, which has been shown to be genotype-specific in boechera  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study constitutes the first extensive insight into the conservation and expression of mirnas in boechera sexual and apomictic species. of the expressed mirna transcription factor targets observed, only the mir156/ <dig> family target squamosa promoter binding protein-like  <dig>  was found differentially expressed with significant  up-regulation at the stage two of ovule development in apomictic species. also demonstrated here is that nucleotide changes in mature mirnas significantly  enhance the thermodynamic stability of pre-mirna stem-loops. this work will enhance subsequent elucidation of the repertoire of mirna expression in boechera towards revealing the potential role of mirnas in the switch from sexual to apomictic reproduction.
