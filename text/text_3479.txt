BACKGROUND
lactobacilli colonize the normal healthy gastrointestinal tract, including the oral cavity  <cit> . lactobacillus species have health-promoting  traits by altering the biofilm microbial composition  <cit>  or by stimulating the host immune response  <cit> . beneficial probiotic effects come from the activity of viable organisms  <cit> . probiotic action of several lactobacillus species and strains has been associated with reduction of chronic inflammatory diseases  <cit>  and weight regulation  <cit> . lactobacilli can cause dental caries through their highly acidogenic and acid-tolerant characteristics  <cit> , and are frequently detected in deep carious lesions  <cit> . recent studies, however, suggest an additional beneficial role for oral lactobacilli  <cit> . strains of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus from caries-free subjects were found to inhibit in vitro growth of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus more efficiently than lactobacillus strains isolated from caries-active subjects  <cit> . further, in preschool children oral lactobacillus acidophilus was associated with lack of caries  <cit> .

we recently reported that lactobacilli were detected in saliva from  <dig> month-old breastfed but not formula-fed infants  <cit> , and preliminary findings indicated that lactobacillus gasseri was the dominant salivary lactobacillus. early colonization of cariogenic pathogens, particularly streptococcus mutans, can increase the risk of childhood caries  <cit> . if certain lactobacillus strains can suppress s. mutans, it becomes important in caries risk assessment to determine which lactobacilli are acquired in infancy and whether the colonizing strains or species have probiotic potential. few studies, however, have examined lactobacilli in infants and probiotic activity of strains.

breast milk provides nutrition for the infant, bacteria that can impact the microbial composition of the gastro-intestinal tract  <cit> , and components that can influence bacterial attachment and growth in the mouth, stomach and intestine  <cit> . the dominant constituents in milk are lipids, lactose, oligosaccharides and proteins  <cit> , and the major energy source in milk is triglycerides and other fats. fats are extruded from the epithelial cell as globules that are enveloped by the epithelial cell membrane, known as the “milk fat globule membrane”   <cit> . mfgm is rich in phospholipids, gangliosides, cholesterol and many biologically active proteins  <cit> . the mfgm fraction participates in cellular processes and defense mechanisms in the newborn, including those involved in microbial acquisition  <cit> . mfgm proteins comprise 1-4% of the total milk protein  <cit> , and includes seven major protein components: alpha-lactalbumin, lysozyme precursor, beta-casein, clusterin, lactotransferrin, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor precursor, and human milk fat globule egf-factor  <dig> protein  <cit> . many of these proteins are glycosylated  <cit> . mfgm adheres to lactobacillus reuteri <cit> , but does not affect l. acidophilus or l. gasseri <cit> .

the aim of the present study was  to quantitate total lactobacilli in saliva from  <dig> month-old breastfed and formula-fed infants,  to identify the dominant lactobacillus species and  evaluate possible probiotic traits of the most prevalent lactobacillus species by analyzing their adhesion to host exocrine secretions and tissues , and their effect on growth of selected oral species in vitro. here we report that oral lactobacilli are detected more frequently in breastfed than formula-fed infants, and that l. gasseri, the dominant species detected, has probiotic traits.

methods
study group
four month-old infants were recruited from an ongoing study evaluating a novel infant formula . details of the parent study will be reported elsewhere . infants entering the parent study between september  <dig> and june  <dig> were invited to participate in the current study that added oral microbial sampling . inclusion criteria were: 0– <dig> months old, birth weight  <dig> - <dig>  g, full term, and exclusively breast or formula-fed at the time of recruitment. the exclusion criterion was chronic illness. the parent study population aimed to recruit twice as many formula- as breastfed infants. formula-fed infants received either a standard infant formula  or an infant formula containing mfgm fraction . infant body weight and length at birth and recruitment, vaginal or c-section delivery and use of antibiotics was obtained from medical records. breast or bottle feeding information including type of formula given to infants before recruitment and consumption of probiotics products were obtained from infant’s diet records.

the current study population of  <dig> infants, comprised  <dig> breastfed infants,  <dig> standard formula-fed infants and  <dig> infants fed the mfgm enriched formula. saliva could not be collected from six infants , and oral swabs were not obtained from five infants . one standard formula-fed infant had received antibiotics at birth and one mfgm enriched formula-fed infant received antibiotics at  <dig> months of age. twenty-five infants had been given commercially available probiotic oral drops  containing l. reuteri atcc  <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> months of age. infants given probiotic drops did not differ between the three feeding groups .

the study was approved by the regional ethical review board in umeå, sweden. all caregivers signed informed consent when recruited.

culture of salivary lactobacilli and characterization of isolates
whole saliva was collected from the infants and lactobacillus cultured using selective medium as previously described  <cit> . up to  <dig> isolates were selected from each plate and were identified by comparing 16s rrna gene sequences to databases homd  and ncbi .

qpcr for l. gasseri in mucosal swabs
the mucosa of the cheeks, the tongue and alveolar ridges of the infants were swabbed using sterile cotton swabs . samples storage, dna purification and l. gasseri level quantification by qpcr were as described previously  <cit> .

growth inhibition by l. gasseri
cultural conditions and bacterial strains used in growth inhibition tests
lactobacillus isolates were maintained on de man, rogosa, sharpe agar   and grown in mrs broth. s. mutans strains ingbritt, ng <dig>  lt <dig> and jbp, s. sobrinus strains omz <dig> and  <dig>  actinomyces naeslundii genospecies  <dig> strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  and actinomyces oris  strains t14v and m <dig> were maintained on columbia agar plates  supplemented with 5% horse blood  and grown in todd-hewitt broth . fusobacterium nucleatum strains atcc  <dig> and uja11-a were maintained on fastidious anaerobe agar  and grown in peptone yeast extract broth . bacteria were cultured anaerobically at 37°c for 48– <dig> h  or  <dig> h . candida albicans strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  gdh <dig>  gdh <dig> and ca <dig> were maintained on difco™ sabouraud maltose agar  for  <dig> h and grown in difco™ sabouraud maltose broth  overnight under aerobic conditions at 37°c.

growth inhibition by agar overlay
five l. gasseri isolates with single nucleotide differences in the 16s rrna gene from infants  and the l. gasseri type strain ccug  <dig>  were tested for growth inhibition using an agar overlay method  <cit> . oral bacteria tested were s. mutans, s. sobrinus, a. naeslundii, a. oris , supplemented with lactose)), f. nucleatum and c. albicans . agar plates without lactobacilli were negative controls. growth was scored:  <dig> = no growth, complete inhibition; score  <dig> = moderate growth, slight inhibition; and score  <dig> = same or more growth as the control, no inhibition  <cit> .

adhesion and aggregation tests for l. gasseri
saliva, milk and mfgm fractions
parotid saliva from two healthy adult donors and submandibular/sublingual saliva from one adult donor were collected into ice-chilled vials and used immediately or stored in aliquots at −80°c. sterile lashley cups were used for ductal parotid saliva collection and a custom made device for submandibular/sublingual saliva collection  <cit> . breast milk from two healthy mothers was defatted  <cit>  and stored at −80°c. saliva and defatted milk were diluted 1: <dig> in adhesion buffer  and freeze-dried purified lacprodan® mfgm- <dig> diluted in adh  were used in the experiments.

l. gasseri adhesion to host ligand coated hydroxyapatite
following overnight culture on mrs agar, cells from l. gasseri strains b <dig>  b <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  and ccug  <dig> were harvested and transferred to  <dig> μl phosphate buffered saline  with  <dig> μci trans -labeled-methionine . after overnight culture on cab agar at 37°c in an anaerobic chamber, radiolabeled cells were harvested, washed three times in adh buffer, and bacterial concentration determined by comparing the turbidity against a standard curve. s. mutans strain ingbritt was cultured and radiolabeled as described  <cit> .

adhesion of l. gasseri to host ligands coated hydroxyapatite  was performed as described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> mg ha beads  were coated separately with human parotid saliva, submandibular/sublingual saliva, human defatted milk or lacprodan-mfgm- <dig> during end-over-end agitation for  <dig> h at room temperature. after washing and blocking, coated beads were incubated with radiolabeled l. gasseri  and the bacteria were allowed to adhere for  <dig> h, after which the unbound bacteria were washed away. the numbers of attached lactobacilli were determined by scintillation counting.

bacterial adhesion inhibition  <cit>  was tested in two sets of experiments. first, l. gasseri strains were pre-incubated separately with human parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva for  <dig> min at 37°c. after removal of l. gasseri cells and ha coating with pre-incubated ligand, radiolabeled s. mutans strain ingbritt was allowed to adhere as described above. in the second set of experiments s. mutans was used for pre-incubation, and radiolabeled l. gasseri allowed to adhere for  <dig> h. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated on two separate occasions.

l. gasseri aggregation
equal volumes of a bacterial cell suspension  with parotid, submandibular/sublingual saliva, defatted human milk or lacprodan® mfgm- <dig>  were agitated on a glass slide for  <dig> min at 37°c. the size of visible aggregates was rated on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig> under microscopic inspection  <cit> .

l. gasseri adhesion to human epithelial cells
the adhesive capacity of l. gasseri was examined using human primary gingival epithelial hgepp. <dig> purchased from cellntec . cells were cultured in cnt- <dig> cell culture medium  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. the adhesion assay was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, cells were seeded at different concentrations  and cultured on 4-well lab-tek™ ii chamber slide™ system glass slides  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. cells were then fixed in 30% acetone in methanol and the slides were blocked with 1% bsa in pbst  for  <dig> h.

l. gasseri strains were cultured on mrs agar for  <dig> h at 37°c in an anaerobic chamber and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate   <cit> . lactobacilli cell density was adjusted to od <dig> =  <dig>  and stored at −80°c until use. before addition to the gingival epithelial cell coated slides, the bacteria were diluted  <dig> times in 1% bsa in pbst. after incubation for  <dig> h, the slides were washed  <dig> times in pbst  and mounted for microscopy evaluation. all images were acquired using a zeiss imager z <dig> upright microscopic  and software zen  <dig> with 400× optical magnification.

salivary host ligands for l. gasseri
the presence of binding epitopes in salivary gp <dig> and muc <dig> were evaluated by western blot  <cit>  for five l. gasseri isolates  and strain ccug  <dig>  briefly,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were suspended in  <dig>  ml kcl buffer  and incubated under slow rotation for  <dig> h at room temperature with  <dig>  ml parotid or submandibular/sublingual saliva diluted 1: <dig> in kcl buffer. bacteria were separated from unbound salivary components by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at room temperature. to release the bound proteins, the bacterial pellets were boiled with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate  for  <dig> min  was also added) and separated on 5% tris–hcl gel . proteins were transferred to a  membrane . the membranes were blocked and epitopes detected with monoclonal antibodies against gp <dig>   <cit>  or lum7- <dig>  <cit> . membranes were washed with tbs  or pbs  and incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-mouse  for gp <dig> or hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit  for muc <dig> and detected using super signal west dura extended duration substrate .

data processing and statistical analyses
the power calculation for the parent study was based on body weight as main outcome  <cit>  with a statistical power of 80% and a level of significance of  <dig> % . based on previous investigations  <cit> , the number of infants included in this study was sufficient to detect a difference in bacterial colonization pattern.

data handling and statistical analyses were performed using pasw statistics  <dig> . anthropometric measures for infants were averaged, and means with 95% ci reported. differences between means were tested using analysis of variance  followed by a bonferroni post hoc test. differences between means for lactobacilli detected in saliva and swabs were tested using generalized linear modeling adjusted for delivery method and exposure to probiotic drops at  <dig> months. l. gasseri detected in swabs was additionally adjusted for amount of dna. categorical data are presented as proportions  and differences between groups were tested with a chi <dig> test. a p-value < <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

multivariate partial least squares analysis  was performed  as previously described  <cit> . cross-validation  was performed by a systematic prediction of 1/7th of the data by the remaining 6/7th of the data. the importance of each variable in the model was displayed in a loading scatter plot. r2- and q2-values give the capacity of the x-variables to explain  and predict  the outcome.

RESULTS
among the  <dig> infants, the proportions of boys and girls, infants delivered vaginally, mean body weight and length at birth and at  <dig> months of age  did not differ significantly between infants fed breast milk, the standard formula or the mfgm-enriched formula . this observation was not affected by exclusion of infants given antibiotics or probiotic drops.

 <dig> differences in proportions between feeding group numbers were tested with chi <dig> test. shared superscript letters  indicate differences between groups when tested pairwise .

 <dig> data are presented as mean  and differences between group means were tested with anova.

 <dig> data are presented as mean . means are adjusted for delivery mode and exposure to probiotic drops at  <dig> months using generalized linear modelling . shared superscript letters  indicate groups that differ significant when tested pairwise . the p-value between the two formula groups was p= <dig> .

 <dig> data are presented as mean . means are adjusted for delivery mode, exposure to probiotic drops at  <dig> months  and amount of dna using generalized linear modelling. shared superscript letter  indicates the groups that differ significantly when tested pairwise . table  <dig> shows p-value between groups . p-values for the breastfed versus the standard formula group was p= <dig>  and breastfed versus mfgm formula group p= <dig> , and between the two formula groups p= <dig> .  <dig> ×105pg/ml correspond to  <dig> × <dig> cfu l. gasseri cells/ml. employing number of bacteria/ml in the regression model leads to identical results.

total cultivable lactobacillus in infant saliva
lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of  <dig> %  of the breastfed infants compared with  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the standard and mfgm enriched formula-fed infants, respectively . partial least square regression  identified a feeding method , l. gasseri in saliva, and l. gasseri  in oral swabs as significantly influential for total numbers of lactobacilli/ml in saliva  . exposure to probiotic drops and delivery mode were positively associated with presence of lactobacilli but to a lower degree. the explanatory power of the model was  <dig> %  and the predictive power  <dig> % . mean cfu/ml saliva of lactobacilli , standardized for the potential confounders probiotic drops and delivery method, were significantly higher in breastfed infants than in standard and mfgm formula-fed infants, . presence and mean levels of salivary lactobacilli were approximately twice as high in the mfgm group than the standard formula group, but the difference was not statistically significant. restricting the analyses to vaginally delivered infants and those who never received antibiotics and/or probiotic drops did not change findings .

l. gasseri in saliva and oral swabs
 <dig> putative lactobacillus isolates from saliva were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences as l. gasseri , lactobacillus fermentum , l. reuteri , lactobacillus casei/rhamnosus , l. paracasei  and l. plantarum  . l. gasseri was detected in 88% of the lactobacillus positive infants. the distribution of lactobacillus species detected in infants is in table  <dig>  only one lactobacillus species was detected in most infants  .

 <dig> one species was found in  <dig> infants , two species in two infants , and three species in one infant .

# formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane fraction.

l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in  <dig> % of  <dig> oral swabs analyzed. generalized univariate analysis indicated that breastfed infants had significantly higher mean levels of l. gasseri in oral swabs than infants fed a standard formula  but not the mfgm formula. there was, however, no statistically significant difference between the three feeding groups when analyzed together . means were standardized for the potential confounders of exposure to probiotic drops at  <dig> months, delivery mode and total dna. in infants with cultivable salivary lactobacilli,  <dig> % were positive for l. gasseri by qpcr in mucosal swabs , and  <dig> % were l. gasseri positive by qpcr in mucosal swabs and from sequenced salivary isolates .

pls modeling with feeding groups as dependent variables indicated that total lactobacillius counts/ml of saliva, l. gasseri in saliva, probiotic drops at  <dig> month of age, and l. gasseri in oral swabs  were influential . the explanatory power of the model was  <dig> %  and the predictive power  <dig> % .

l. gasseri growth inhibition on oral bacteria
five l. gasseri isolates  and the l. gasseri type strain inhibited growth of f. nucleatum strains atcc  <dig> and uja <dig>  a. naeslundii genospecies <dig> strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  a. oris  strains t14v and m <dig>  s. mutans strains ingbritt, ng <dig>  lt <dig> and jbp, s. sobrinus strains omz <dig> and  <dig>  and c. albicans strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  gdh <dig>  gdh <dig> and ca <dig>  in a concentration dependent fashion . all l. gasseri strains, inhibited f. nucleatum the most and c. albicans the least.

l. gasseri binding to host receptors in saliva and milk
more l. gasseri b <dig> cells bound to hydroxyapatite coated with submandibular/sublingual saliva  or parotid saliva  than other strains. there was less avid binding to purified bovine mfgm fraction , and binding to human milk did not exceed binding to the buffer control . the binding pattern was similar for all l. gasseri strains, although the percentages of bound bacterial cells were slightly lower for four isolates than the type strain and isolate b <dig> . aggregation of l. gasseri cells by saliva showed a similar adhesion pattern to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite for all five isolates and the type strain . aggregation by submandibular/sublingual saliva was highest , followed by parotid saliva  and mfgm   and human milk  .

 <dig>  <dig> × <dig> bacterial cells were added into each test well. + binding of <15% of added bacterial cells, ++ ≥ <dig> to <20%, and +++ ≥20%.

 <dig> – =aggregation score  <dig> , + aggregation score  <dig> , ++ aggregation score  <dig> , +++ aggregation score  <dig>   <cit> . adhesion buffer was used a negative control  and s. mutans strain ingbritt as positive control   <cit> .

adhesion of s. mutans strain ingbritt to parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva decreased significantly after pre-incubation of saliva with l. gasseri strain b <dig> . a similar pattern was observed for l. gasseri binding after pre-incubation of saliva with s. mutans.

gp <dig>  was not detected by western blot analysis with mab <dig> antibodies in l. gasseri isolate b <dig> , but gp <dig> was detected in parotid  and submandibular saliva . the levels of gp <dig> were reduced in both salivas after incubation with l. gasseri . furthermore, bound gp <dig> was detected on l. gasseri  after incubation with saliva, and sds treatment released gp <dig> bound to l. gasseri . similar results were observed for s. mutans strain ingbritt . the six additional isolates of l. gasseri also adhered to gp <dig> .

muc <dig>  was detected using western blot analysis with mab lum7- <dig> antibodies in submandibular saliva  but not in parotid saliva . muc <dig> levels were reduced in submandibular saliva after incubation with l. gasseri  and s. mutans . muc <dig> was detected bound to l. gasseri  and s. mutans  after incubation with submandibular saliva. sds treatment released the muc <dig> bound to l. gasseri  and to s. mutans . similar results were observed for muc <dig> binding to six additional isolates of l. gasseri .

l. gasseri binds to human epithelial cells
adherence of fitc-tagged l. gasseri strains was detected by fluorescence microscopy as illustrated for strain a <dig> . all l gasseri strains were observed only adjacent to epithelial cells.

discussion
in this study lactobacilli were detected more frequently in breastfed than formula-fed  <dig> month-old infants in saliva and mucosal swab samples as we previously observed in a different population of infants  <cit> . l. gasseri was the dominant lactobacillus species detected, which was identified from 16s rna gene sequences of isolates. probiotic potential of l. gasseri was found to include growth inhibition of f. nucleatum, a. naeslundii, a. oris, s. sobrinus and c. albicans in addition to the previously reported s. mutans and s. sanguinis <cit> . other characteristics of l. gasseri were inhibition of adhesion to hydroxyapatite in the presence of saliva, salivary gp <dig> and muc <dig> suggesting possible mechanisms for probiotic activity.

the infants sampled were recruited from a randomized clinical trial of mfgm supplemented infant formula compared with a standard formula and breastfeeding. compliance to the feeding regimens was acceptable according to diet records obtained from the parent study. infants recruited into the parent study were between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age. the estimated intake of breast milk at study enrollment was similar in the standard formula and the mfgm formula groups. when infants were sampled at  <dig> months of age, they had been exposed to either formula or breast milk for two months  <cit> . the lack of difference between the formula-fed groups suggests that this period might not have been long enough or that the different formulations do not induce changes in the oral microbiota. previous studies, however, have observed that feeding mode, method of delivery, use of antibiotics and probiotic products may influence the oral and intestinal microbiota  <cit> . we accounted for these possible confounders in the pls analysis, and found they had only marginally influential for feeding group allocations and total lactobacilli counts.

l. gasseri was identified as the dominant lactobacillus species in the oral cavities of the  <dig> month-old infants. this is consistent with previous studies on lactobacillus detection in the oral cavity  <cit>  and the infant gut  <cit> . l. gasseri is a member of the l. acidophilus complex, which includes l. acidophilus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus johnsonii <cit> . strains belonging to the l. gasseri complex have been extensively studied for “probiotic” traits, including attachment to epithelial cells, growth inhibition, replacement or binding inhibition of pathogens and immunomodulation  <cit> . l. gasseri strains from feces and human milk have been observed to  adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal mucus   <cit> ,  produce bacteriocins  <cit> ,  reduce mutagenic enzymes in feces  <cit> ,  stimulate macrophages and lymphocytes,  modulate the immune systems through the toll receptors  <cit>  and  show resistance to gastric and small intestine fluids  <cit> . in the current report, salivary l. gasseri demonstrated several probiotic traits including: attachment to the human gingival epithelial cells hgepp. <dig> and saliva, growth inhibition of several oral species and reduced attachment of the cariogenic s. mutans to saliva. potential in vivo effects on the microbiota as well as short and long term biological processes remain to be demonstrated, but in vivo effects might be anticipated as we observed growth inhibition at l. gasseri concentrations as low as  <dig> cfu/ml, which are the levels reported for human milk  <cit> .

studies have reported that breast milk contains l. gasseri, l. salivarius and l. fermentum, of which l. gasseri was the most prevalent species  <cit> , but the prevalence of l. gasseri detection has not been reported. we cultured lactobacillus species, predominantly l. gasseri, from approximately one third of breastfed infants with lower to non-detectable levels from formula-fed infants. this is consistent with our previous rapport  <cit> . breast milk was not collected from the mothers, so we do not know whether detection of l. gasseri in infants reflects its presence in the mother’s milk. other possible reasons for variability of l. gasseri detection in infants saliva include: individuality in adhesion site blocking on l. gasseri , and phenotypic host receptor variation. few studies have examined host receptors for, and adhesion properties of, l. gasseri and lactobacilli in general  <cit> . binding of various lactobacilli species to saliva gp <dig>  <cit> , peroxidase  <cit>  and gastric and intestinal mucus  <cit> , blood group antigens and histone h <dig>  <cit>  has been reported. most of these host receptors are heavily glycosylated and several carry blood group antigens  <cit> , which is consistent with the present findings of more avid binding of l. gasseri to submandibular/sublingual saliva, gp <dig>  muc <dig> and mfgm. interestingly, it was reported recently  <cit>  that the innate immunity peptide ll <dig>  which has been detected in the mouth on epithelial cells and in submandibular/sublingual saliva  <cit> , alters the surface of l. crispatus with a possible influence on its adhesive traits  <cit> . since gp <dig> and muc <dig>  exist as polymorphic variants  <cit> , and phenotypic variation in gp <dig> relates to s. mutans adhesion avidity , it seems possible that phenotypic host receptor variation can influence l. gasseri colonization in breastfed infants. this would suggest that bacterial acquisition in infancy, and potential beneficial effects from probiotic products, may vary among individuals.

pre-incubation of l. gasseri with saliva reduced detectable salivary gp <dig>  and thus the observed s. mutans binding to gp <dig>  suggesting that l. gasseri and s. mutans share a binding epitope in saliva. competitive binding has previously been observed between s. mutans and other lactobacilli species with gp <dig>  <cit> . l. gasseri strains have also been shown to compete with, displace, and inhibit the adhesion of the enteric pathogens cronobacter sakazakii and clostridium difficile to intestinal mucus  <cit> . this suggests that l. gasseri may play a similar role in the oral cavity as has been observed in the gut. although saliva from adults was used in the present study, gp <dig> has been detected in saliva in infants  <cit> . saliva has been shown to have a stable pattern of salivary proteins and glycoproteins from early infancy, with the exception of albumin and the mucins, with early dominance of muc <dig> later followed by muc5b  <cit> .

infants fed the mfgm supplemented formula tended to have higher oral levels of total lactobacilli and l. gasseri than infants fed a standard formula. this could reflect that mfgm provides a wide range of potential carbohydrate binding epitopes on glycoproteins and glycolipids, and that l. gasseri bound to purified mfgm coated on hydroxyapatite . an increased content of mfgm supplementation could potentially foster acquisition of l. gasseri and/or other lactobacillus species in the gastro-intestinal tract, but this concept needs further study.

CONCLUSIONS
our study findings lead us to conclude that the oral cavities of breastfed infants are colonized by lactobacilli more frequently than formula-fed infants and that l. gasseri is the dominant lactobacillus species. l. gasseri from infants has characteristics consistent with probiotic properties, which could influence the composition of the oral microbiota in infants.
