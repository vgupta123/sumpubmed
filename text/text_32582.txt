BACKGROUND
neurofibromatosis type  <dig>  is a common autosomal dominant disorder affecting  <dig> in  <dig>  individuals worldwide. typical clinical features of nf <dig> include multiple café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, iris lisch nodules, and neurofibromas. neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors designated as either dermal neurofibromas  or plexiform neurofibromas . pnfs are regarded as congenital benign tumors that often develop in association with major nerve tracts. about  <dig> to 50% of nf <dig> patients develop clinically visible pnfs  <cit> . although pnfs are considered as benign tumors, they can be life threatening when they develop deeply and compress internal organs. pnfs are complex tumors, heterogeneous at the cellular level, mainly composed of schwann cells, which are the likely pathogenic cell type in neurofibromas, together with fibroblasts, mast cells, neurons, vascular elements, and perineurial cells. in contrast to dnfs, pnfs can transform in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  in about 10% of the cases. mpnsts are highly invasive sarcomas that metastasize widely and display a poor prognosis.

nf <dig> is caused by germline heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene nf <dig> located at 17q <dig> . nf <dig> encodes neurofibromin, a ras-gtpase-activating protein . neurofibromin negatively regulates the ras signalling pathways  involved in proliferation, survival, and differentiation. according to the knudson’s two-hit model, nf <dig> tumorigenesis results from a somatic mutation disrupting the second functional copy of the nf <dig> gene. this complete inactivation of nf <dig> induces ras signaling pathway activation and seems required but not sufficient for tumorigenesis promotion. rare additional molecular alterations have been described in pnfs, including cdkn2a/b locus deletions  <cit> . in contrast, mpnsts are characterized by complexe genomic changes including inactivation of tp <dig> and rb <dig> and amplification of egfr, hgf, and met <cit> . expression studies have reported differential expression profile in mpnsts of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, extracellular remodeling and schwann cell differentiation such as tp <dig>  rb <dig>  cdkn2a, twist <dig>  birc <dig>  top2a, and sox <dig> <cit> . finally, transgenic mouse models have provided evidences for tp <dig> and pten implication in pnfs formation and schwann cells malignant transformation  <cit> .

since their initial discovery in caenorhabditis elegans in  <dig>  <cit> , the highly conserved small non-coding rnas called micrornas  have been extensively implicated in human physiology and pathology. in the last few years, mirnas have revealed major roles in regulating critical biological processes such as development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. mirnas aberrant expression has also been characterized in many human cancer types. however, the involvement of mirnas deregulation in the formation of benign neurofibromas and malignant progression from pnfs to mpnsts remains largely unknown. here, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  assays to quantify the expression of a panel of  <dig> well-validated mirnas in a large series of nf1-associated tumors , two normal peripheral nerve samples, and two mpnst cell lines.

RESULTS
we quantified the expression of  <dig> mirnas in nine dnfs,  <dig> pnfs, and  <dig> mpnsts. we also analyzed mirnas expression in two adult peripheral nerves as a non-tumorigenic control tissue and in two mpnst cell lines  as malignant controls. a significant number  of mirnas were below the detection level of the assay  in mpnsts, pnfs, and dnfs and were consequently regarded as “not expressed”. eighty-four  mirnas were considered as detectable but not reliably quantifiable  in the three groups of tumors. thereby, more than half of mirnas  were not further analyzed in our study. in each sample, the negative control assay unrelated to mammalian species, ath-mir159a, was not expressed .

unsupervised hierarchical clustering
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> nf1-associated tumors, two adult peripheral non-tumorigenic control nerves, and the two nf1-associated mpnst cell lines identified six main subgroups, based on the expression of the  <dig> mirnas considered as expressed and reliably quantifiable. one of the subgroup contained  <dig> of the  <dig> mpnst samples together with both mpnsts cell lines  and no other tumor types. the three remaining mpnst samples  clustered in a small subgroup of six tumors. our unsupervised hierarchical clustering discriminated mpnsts from benign neurofibromas but failed to distinguish between both types of neurofibromas . this result mainly reflects that mirnas expression profile is more deregulated in mpnsts than in benign neurofibromas.

comparison of mirnas profile between dnfs and pnfs
dnfs and pnfs are both benign nerve stealth tumors but pnfs can undergo malignant transformation, in contrast to dnfs. hence, we first compared mirnas expression between dnfs and pnfs. mirnas were considered as significantly differentially expressed between dnfs and pnfs when the p-value of the non-parametric comparison mann–whitney test was less than  <dig>  . eleven mirnas met these criteria and were considered as displaying a markedly different expression between dnfs and pnfs . among these  <dig> mirnas, ten were upregulated  and only one  was downregulated  in pnfs as compared to dnfs. the only downregulated mirna in pnfs compared to dnfs  has previously been described to be silenced in various types of malignancies.

hierarchical clustering
to identify a mirna signature that could be a useful adjunct to nf1-associated tumor diagnosis, a hierarchical clustering was performed. hierarchical clustering of the nine dnf and  <dig> pnf samples, based on the expression of the  <dig> significantly deregulated mirnas between those two types of tumors  identified two main groups of tumor samples with exclusively pnfs in one group . both peripheral nerve samples  clustered in the dnfs-containing subgroup. we also selected the  <dig> most strongly deregulated mirnas between pnfs and mpnsts  to perform a hierarchical clustering of these two types of tumors. analysis of the dendrogram based on the expression of those  <dig> mirnas allowed us to identified two main groups, with 98% of pnfs  clustered in one group and 80% of mpnsts  in the other group . interestingly, mpnsts cell lines clustered with the mpnsts-containing subgroup.

coregulation of physically clustered mirnas
we hypothesized that clustered mirnas  may function as a single transcription unit. among upregulated mirnas in mpnsts compared to pnfs , we identified several clustered mirnas: mir-301b and mir-130b are located in 22q <dig> , mir-301a and mir- <dig> are located in 17q <dig> in the first intron of the ska <dig> gene, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are located in xq <dig> inside the gabre gene, mir-106b and mir- <dig> are located in 7q <dig> within intron  <dig> of the mcm <dig> gene, and mir-19a, mir-18a, mir-20a, and mir-19b belong to the polycistronic cluster mir-17 ~  <dig> located in 13q <dig> . similarly, among the mirnas upregulated in pnfs compared to dnfs , mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> belong to the same cluster located in 5q <dig>  a spearman’s rank correlation test demonstrated that mir-301b and mir-130b , mir-301a and mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> , mir-106b and mir- <dig> , and mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  have positive correlated expression. in addition, we showed that both mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  have positive correlated expression with their host gene, gabre.

coregulation of paralogous mirnas
we hypothesized that paralogous mirnas may target the same protein-coding genes, acting as synergistic co-regulators of shared target genes. among the most significantly upregulated mirnas in mpnsts compared to pnfs , two couples of paralogous mirnas differ in only few base pairs: mir-301a and mir-301b , and mir-10a and mir-10b . using a spearman test, we demonstrated that expression of mir-301a and mir-301b , and mir-10a and mir-10b  have significantly positive correlated expression. these paralogous mirnas have high sequence identity but are located at different loci and chromosomes. their correlated overexpressions in mpnsts may depend on common regulation and could reflect a cooperative activity to switch off shared target genes.

inverse expression of mirnas with their protein-coding gene targets
using spearman’s rank correlation test, we reported that several upregulated mirnas in mpnsts compared to pnfs have significant inverse correlated expression with their previously identified target genes: hmga <dig> mrna expression is inversely correlated with let-7b  and pten expression is inversely correlated with mir-301a , mir-19a , and mir-106b .

expression of four mirnas processing machinery components: dicer, drosha, dgcr <dig> and ago2
alterations of mirnas processing machinery components expression have been reported in human tumors  <cit> . we therefore explored the possibility that global mirna dysregulation observed in nf <dig> tumorigenesis could be due to altered expression of dicer, drosha, dgcr <dig> and/or ago <dig>  and their expressions were determined. no significant differences in dicer, drosha, dgcr <dig> and ago <dig> mrna levels were found in pnfs compared to dnfs or in mpnsts compared to pnfs . these observations reinforce the specificity of the identified signature  versus a global mirnaome deregulation caused by a tumor alteration of mirnas biogenesis.

discussion
recent evidences indicate that mirna network play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression involved in tumor development and progression. in this study, we applied a rt-pcr analysis to comprehensively characterize the expression pattern of  <dig> mirnas in a large series of benign and malignant nf1-related nerve sheath tumors.

eleven mirnas were found to be differentially expressed between dnfs and pnfs . interestingly, the most significantly upregulated mirna in pnfs, mir-486-3p, targets the major tumor suppressor gene, pten <cit> . pten expression is frequently decreased in a wide spectrum of human cancers with several mirnas being validated as pten regulators  <cit> . using murine conditional deletion of pten and activation of kras, gregorian at al. suggested that pten dosage is critical for formation of pnfs  <cit> . mirnas regulation typically allows such subtle modulations in gene expression dosage. it is important to note that the two tested peripheral nerve samples  showed similar level expression of mir-486-3p than dnf samples . overexpression of mir-486-3p in pnfs may therefore specifically reflect an abnormal upregulation in these tumors. we further hypothesised that mir-486-3p may be a major onco-mir by downregulating pten in pnfs development.

our results also reveal overexpression of mir181a in pnfs. mir181a targets atm <cit> , a tumor suppressor that regulates the p <dig> pathway  <cit>  that has been shown to be essential for pnfs formation in transgenic mouse models  <cit> . similar level expression of mir181a was found in both peripheral nerve samples and in dnfs samples .

finally, three other markedly overexpressed mirnas in pnfs compared to dnfs have previously been demonstrated to negatively regulate the ras signaling pathway: mir- <dig> targets map3k <dig> <cit> , mir- <dig> targets kras <cit> , and mir- <dig> targets rreb <dig> <cit> . biallelic loss of function of the nf <dig> gene in neurofibromas promotes activation of the ras signaling pathway. we assume that overexpression of these four mirnas may reveal a feedback loop that attempts to correct hyperactivation of ras signaling. interestingly, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are both located at 5q <dig> and have positive correlated expressions, suggesting a common transcription unit, allowing a concerted action on ras pathway.

we also investigated the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas between pnfs and mpnsts. among the  <dig> upregulated and the ten downregulated mirnas in mpnsts, we further analyzed the most markedly differentially expressed mirnas . a subset of mirnas  previously demonstrated to directly target the suppressor pten was found to be overexpressed in mpnsts. recent transgenic mice model with pten and nf <dig> conditional knock out in schwann cells, implicated the synergistic role of pten and nf <dig> inactivation in mpnsts development  <cit> . we confirmed that pten expression was inversely correlated with mir-301a, mir-19a, and mir-106b. interestingly, we showed that paralogs mir-301a and mir-301b have significantly positive correlated expression suggesting that these two mirnas may synergistically target pten.

we also identified a panel of five deregulated mirnas  that are major regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . mir-135b and mir-135a represent the most overexpressed mirnas in mpnsts compared to pnfs . members of the mir- <dig> family target the tumor suppressor apc, a key negative regulator of the wnt canonical pathway involved in tumorigenesis  <cit> . e-cadherin  <cit>  is a major epithelial adherens junction protein which plays a critical role in emt. mir- <dig> is also overexpressed in mpnsts and it has been previously demonstrated that mir- <dig> is upregulated in breast cancer cells and targets the e-cadherin gene   <cit> .

mir-200c and let-7b are both downregulated in mpnsts compared to pnfs. members of mir- <dig> family act as critical regulators of emt and contribute to the acquisition of invasive behavior in many types of cancer  <cit> . they negatively regulate expression of zeb <dig> <cit>  and zeb <dig>  two e-box binding transcription factors that are powerful regulators of e-cadherin expression and several other effectors involved in epithelial polarity. let- <dig> family mirnas regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and are frequently downregulated in many human cancers  <cit> . they are considered as tumor suppressor mirnas, notably through targeting genes with oncogenic activity such as ras <cit>  and hmga <dig> <cit> . we confirmed that hmga <dig> expression is inversely correlated with let-7b. hmga <dig> enhances twist  and inhibits cdkn2a/cdkn2b gene expression, corresponding with aggressive behavior  <cit> . hyperactivation of ras signaling pathway, overexpression of twist <dig> <cit>  and cdkn2a inactivation  <cit>  have frequently been reported in mpnsts. together, upregulation of mir-135a, mir-135b, and mir- <dig> and downregulation of mir-200c and let-7b in mpnsts may thus contribute to mesenchymal transition with acquisition of an invasive behavior in these malignant aggressive tumors.

our results also independently confirm that mir-10b is significantly upregulated in mpnsts compared to pnfs. expression of mir-10b is induced by the metastasis-promoting transcription factor twist  <cit> . chai et al. previously showed overexpression of mir-10b in mpnsts and demonstrated that mir-10b targets nf <dig> mrna  <cit> . mir-10b controls expression of the pro-metastatic rhoc via directly targeting hoxd <dig> mrna  <cit> . hoxd <dig> encodes a homeobox  protein that act as a transcriptional repressor of rhoc. aberrant expression of rho gtpases or rho effectors has been described in various cancer types, suggesting the implication of rho signaling pathway in nf <dig> tumorigenesis  <cit> . interestingly, our analysis of mirnas expression in mpnsts revealed a significant upregulation of others mirnas that target hox genes : mir-196b targets hoxb <dig> <cit> , mir- <dig> targets hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  and hoxa <dig> <cit> , mir-10a and mir-10b target hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig> <cit> , and mir- <dig> target cdx <dig> <cit> . hox genes represent a large group of related genes encoding transcription factors with crucial roles in development, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell motility  <cit> .

among the most markedly differentially expressed mirnas in mpnsts , we also identified a panel of significantly deregulated mirnas  that target major regulators of cell cycle. mir- <dig> is downregulated in mpnsts and has recently been described as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancers  <cit> . mir- <dig> targets several g1/s transition-related genes such as cyclin d <dig> , cdk <dig>  e2f <dig> <cit> , and ccne <dig> <cit> . let-7b  has also been shown to repress ccnd <dig> expression  <cit> . in addition mir- <dig> targets e2f <dig> <cit> , mir-20a targets ccnd <dig> and e2f <dig> <cit> , mir-19a and mir-449a target ccnd <dig> <cit> , mir-129-3p targets cdk <dig> <cit> , and mir-106b targets ccnd <dig> and e2f <dig> <cit> . interestingly, nf <dig> inactivation has previously been shown to enhance ccnd <dig> expression in schwann cells  <cit> . overexpression of ccnd <dig> could thus account for a major feature of the schwann cells proliferation in mpnsts formation. moreover, mir- <dig> has been described as a key regulator of the hypoxia response in tumor onset identified as a major hif1a-induced mirna, and makes link between hypoxia and the regulation of cell cycle  <cit> . we confirmed that mir- <dig> has a significant positive correlated expression with hif1a .

a subset of significantly deregulated mirnas in mpnsts  has previously been described to target members of the ras-mapk pathway. let-7b is a member of the let- <dig> mirnas family which target ras  <cit> . recent data report that mir- <dig> targets raf <dig>  <cit> , a direct downstream effector of ras. interestingly, let-7b and mir- <dig> are both downregulated in mpnsts compared to pnfs and could subsequently act as indirect activator of the ras-mapk pathway. additionally, mir-10b is upregulated in mpnsts and has been previously demonstrated to target nf <dig> <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, mirnaome profiling of nf1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors suggests intricately deregulated associated molecular networks. we identified several subsets of markedly deregulated mirnas in pnfs, in particular mir-486-3p that targets pten, a major component of the ras-pi3k-akt signaling pathway. our work highlights the key role of mirnas in nf1-associated tumorigenesis, leading to subtle reductions in pten levels. our result also confirmed the major role of pten in mpnsts formation. our study identifies mirnas clearly deregulated in mpnsts and involved in oncogenic events including loss of cell adhesion and metastatic behavior mediated by emt, deregulation of hox genes expression, increased cell cycle progression, and ras-mapk aberrant signaling. all of these mirnas should be further investigated using in vitro or in vivo experiments to fully understand their role in the formation of neurofibromas and mpnsts and to identify mechanisms involved in their deregulation. finally, our results may serve for the basis of potential diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and represent novel strategies for effective pharmacological therapies of nf <dig> tumors.
