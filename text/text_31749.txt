BACKGROUND
mirnas are small non-coding rnas that generally act as negative post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. it is estimated that mirnas regulate at least 20% of human genes  <cit> , constituting an important layer of regulation in gene expression networks. the influence of a particular mirna on the transcriptome is difficult to dissect, since genes can harbor binding sites for several mirnas, and a specific mirna can modulate the expression of hundreds of mrna targets  <cit> . mirnas are involved in almost every biological process examined and their deregulation has been associated with a number of pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders  <cit> .

mature mirnas function as components of the rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> , guiding the risc to specific gene targets through base-pairing interactions between the mirna and the mrna. members of the argonaute  protein family are central to risc function. the seed region extends from the second to the seventh or eighth position of mature mirna and has traditionally been considered as a major determinant of the target mrna repertoire, through perfect base pairing with the 3’-untranslated regions  of mrnas  <cit> . other structures of the 3’-end of the mirna are also involved in duplex stability, providing a supplementary site if the seed is fully paired or a compensatory site when the 5’-end has mismatches or bugles  <cit> . however, our knowledge of the determinants governing gene targeting is far from complete. in fact, recent findings show that targeting can occur through sites other than the 3’-utr, and that seed region perfect base pairing is not always required  <cit> . this mirna/mrna binding leads either to target mrna degradation or to translational inhibition, depending, among other factors, on the extent of base-pairing and the type of risc/ago proteins  <cit> .

a novel degree of complexity for mirna transcriptome has been highlighted using next generation sequencing  strategies. ngs has revealed post-transcriptional editing processes in mirnas, mainly consisting in variations in the 3’- and 5’-terminus and to a minor extent, nucleotide substitutions along the mirna sequence  <cit> . variations at the mirna ends may be generated by a shift in drosha and dicer cleavage sites during mirna biogenesis   <cit> . another type of variability is related to pri-mirna post-transcriptional editing as a consequence of adenosine or cytidine deaminase activity . finally, nucleotide additions at the 3’-end of the mirna are another source of mirna variability  <cit> . the resulting sequences differ slightly from the annotated mirna and have been termed isomirs  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest that isomirs are not experimental artifacts derived from rna degradation during sample preparation for ngs  <cit> . in fact the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions are very diferent from sequencing error rates; and the detection of isomirs in many species, tissues and physiological conditions  <cit> , suggests that they may have a biological role. this notion is further supported by their differential expression across developmental stages  <cit> . this scenario suggests that, for a given mirna, posttranscriptional gene expression may depend on different isomirs. however, their functionality as posttranscriptional gene expression regulators needs to be proven. our recent studies of mirna profiling in human brain samples have shown a multitude of mirna variants  <cit> . mir- <dig> is an interesting example, since it presents 5’-trimming isomirs  expressed at levels similar to those of the reference sequence. here, we characterize the ability of this highly expressed human isomir- <dig> to work as a functional mirna.

RESULTS
mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs are expressed at different proportions in different human samples
we have shown that the vast majority of mirnas in human frontal cortex and striatum display sequence variants or isomirs  <cit> . several factors may modulate the physiological relevance of an isomir, including i) the amount of the isomir in relation to the rest of sequences mapping onto the same mirna locus and ii) the type of variant, with special emphasis on nucleotide changes affecting the seed region. sequencing data analysis of these brain areas showed that mir- <dig> was an abundant mirna, represented by approximately  <dig> unique isomirs , although deeper sequencing performed in other brain samples identified more variants . the different mir- <dig> isomirs consisted in trimming variants, nucleotide additions at the 3’ end of the mirna and nucleotide substitutions at different positions along the mature mirna . the distribution of the different types of mir- <dig> isomirs was confirmed in the prefrontal cortex of human brains at different ages in an independent sequencing experiment  <cit>  . trimming variants affecting the 5’ end of the mirna  were among the more abundant species. in fact, the vast majority of mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs affected a single nucleotide upstream of the reference mir- <dig>  therefore defining a new seed region. thus, taking into consideration all the sequences mapping onto mir- <dig>  two main types of seeds were found: acaguac, which is reported in the mirbase, and uacagua, corresponding to the vast majority of mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs. we examined the presence of mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs in another brain area  from four individuals without major histopathological lesions and no clinical neuropathology and in peripheral blood from four healthy individuals, and further analyzed several public high-throughput sequencing datasets from the geo repository corresponding to human brains at different developmental stages  <cit>  and different human cell lines  <cit>  . this analysis indicated that mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs are expressed at high proportions in different human cells, thus suggesting a physiological role for these variants. furthermore, the proportion of each of the major seed regions differs according to the cell type, which suggests a differential modulation of the biogenesis and/or stability of the different mir- <dig> variants.

considering all the sequencing datasets examined, the percentage of sequences mapping onto mir- <dig> varied between tissues and cell lines, with the brain presenting the highest levels . these data suggest that high mir- <dig> levels may be important for adult brain physiology. in fact, mir- <dig> expression is regulated under a number of physiological and pathological conditions, including angiogenesis  <cit> , tumors  <cit>  and neurodegeneration  <cit> . in the last condition, our earlier study identified mir- <dig> as an up-regulated gene in hd  <cit> . however, that study was an overall analysis of all the sequences mapping onto mir- <dig>  to discern the specific expression pattern of mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs, we evaluated the expression of mir- <dig> variants harboring each of the two main seeds in control brains and brains of patients with hd . both types of variants were up-regulated in the frontal cortex and striatum of hd patients. in addition, we performed a similar analysis in other physiological conditions of the nervous system, including in vitro differentiation of the sh-sy5y neuronal cell line to a postmitotic dopaminergic phenotype  and early postnatal development and ageing of the human brain  <cit>  . interestingly, the relative amounts of both types of mir- <dig> variants in the brain differed according to age. these data suggest that mir- <dig> is modulated in the development and differentiation processes of the nervous system. furthermore, the context-dependent variations in the relative amounts of mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> suggest that the mechanisms regulating their biogenesis and/or stability may differ depending on the biological process.

mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> interact with ago <dig> and rck/p54
functional studies aiming to elucidate the possible relevance of the more abundant mir- <dig> isomirs in the nervous system were performed in the neuronal cell line sh-sy5y. we used mirna mimics for two abundant representative sequences containing acaguac or uacagua seeds: the mirbase reference mir- <dig> uacaguacugugauaacugaa, and one of the most abundant mir- <dig> 5’-isomirs presenting the same length as the reference mir- <dig> guacaguacugugauaacuga .

we used highly specific lna™ rt-qpcr assay  for selective detection of mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig>  to test the specificity of the detection, we transfected equivalent amounts of either mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> mature miridian-mimics or a control sequence into sh-sy5y cells and determined the amount of mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> using the corresponding assays . fold changes are expressed relative to the cells transfected with the control sequence. the mir- <dig> rt-qpcr specific assay clearly detected mir- <dig> while 5’-isomir- <dig> was very weakly amplified . a complementary result was obtained using the 5’-isomir- <dig> rt-qpcr specific assay , indicating that both assays are highly selective for each variant.

we then examined whether transfected mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> miridian were incorporated into the risc, using sh-sy5y cells stably expressing ago2-flag. we performed immunoprecipitation  assays using anti-flag antibodies for ago2-ip or control antibodies, and subsequently rna in the ip was isolated. we detected a significant enrichment of either mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> in ago <dig> ip. the amount of mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> in cells transfected with the corresponding mirna mimics was similar . however, increased amounts of mir- <dig> were detected in the ago <dig> ip, compared with 5’-isomir- <dig> , suggesting that mir- <dig> was more efficiently loaded into risc.

the ability of mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> to bind to the risc was further confirmed in complementary experiments designed to evaluate the presence of risc members in transfected biotinylated mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> . miridian 3’-biotin-mir- <dig> and 3’-biotin-5’-isomir- <dig> were transfected in sh-sy5y cells and then pulled down using streptavidin beads. the samples were blotted against ago <dig> and rck/p <dig> which represses translation and associates with the risc complex in order to regulate mirna mediated gene silencing  <cit> . both biotin-mir- <dig> and biotin-5’-isomir- <dig> were able to interact with ago <dig> and rck/p <dig>  although similar levels of each biotinylated miridian were detected in transfected sh-sy5y cells, increased levels of both proteins were found in biotin-mir- <dig> pull downs compared with those of biotin-5’-isomir- <dig>  this result suggests that mir- <dig> binds with risc members more efficiently, which is in agreement with results shown in figure 1b.

to validate the presence of both variants in endogenous risc, we immunoprecipitated ago <dig> from the human frontal cortex. the control experiment included a sample in which the ago <dig> antibody had previously been denaturized  and was therefore unable to interact with ago <dig>  total rna was isolated from ago <dig> and d-ago <dig> ips and subsequently we performed rt-qpcr for mir- <dig>  5’-isomir- <dig>  mir-29a, snord <dig> and u <dig>  data were expressed as the fold change obtained from the ago <dig> vs d-ago <dig> crossing thresholds  . mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> were enriched in ago <dig> ips compared to control d-ago <dig> antibody. mir-29a, a highly abundant mirna in brain  <cit>  was also enriched in ago <dig> complexes. in contrast, the small nucleolar rnas u <dig> and snord <dig>  which were not expected to bind ago <dig>  were detected at insignificant levels. the presence of both types of mir- <dig> variants in ago <dig> immunocomplexes was confirmed in publicly available high-throughput sequencing data of endogenous ago2-associated srnas in hek293t and mouse nih-3t <dig> cells .

to evaluate the possibility that 5’-isomir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are sorted into different agos, we analyzed publicly available small-rna sequencing datasets from ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> ip and total cell extracts, in thp- <dig> human monocytic cells  <cit>  . we found all types of mir- <dig> in each ago . in addition, the percentage of mir- <dig> sequences loaded onto each ago was comparable. grouping the variants according to the two main seeds we found that in total cell homogenates the ratio mir-101/5’-isomir- <dig> in thp- <dig> cells was close to  <dig>  however, this ratio varied slightly depending on the ago protein, with the highest levels being found in ago <dig> and the lowest in ago <dig>  this suggests that although in terms of quantity mir- <dig> exceeded 5’-isomir- <dig> in all agos, mir- <dig> species loaded more onto ago <dig> than 5’-isomir- <dig> variants. this is in agreement with our findings for sh-sy5y.

mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> differentially repress cox- <dig>  mcl- <dig>  app, ezh <dig> and mkp- <dig> expression
since mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> have a different seed region, we evaluated the predicted conserved targets for each variant, using the targetscan  <dig>  release  <cit> , by searching for the presence of 8mer and 7mer sites that match mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> seed regions. targetscan  <dig>  detected that the majority of putative mrna targets  were coincidental, suggesting that mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> may target highly overlapping pathways. in an attempt to identify possible differentially deregulated genes, sh-sy5y cells were transfected with mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> mimics or a scrambled mimic in three independent experiments, and  <dig> h later overall gene expression was evaluated using illumina microarrays . transfection of each mir- <dig> variant resulted in few significantly deregulated genes that showed few changes in expression . mir- <dig> induced a significant downregulation of  <dig> genes, eight being targeted by at least one prediction algorithm. nine out of the  <dig> genes were also downregulated by 5’-isomir- <dig> , while the rest did not show significant variations. thus, 5’-isomir- <dig> seems to induce an overall weaker inhibition. in agreement, transfection of 5’-isomir- <dig> resulted in a slight downregulation of two genes, for which mir- <dig> did not induce significant expression changes. these data indicate that under our experimental conditions modulation of gene expression by mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> may not involve mrna degradation as the main mechanism, and suggest further that mir- <dig> inhibits gene expression more efficiently than 5’-isomir- <dig> 

to gain insights into the possible role of 5’isomir- <dig> in physiological conditions, we analyzed publicly available mrna and small-rna datasets of human brain samples at multiple time-points between early postnatal development and aging  <cit> . we chose this paradigm for two reasons: i/ mir- <dig> expression levels increased through aging, suggesting a role in this process , and ii/ variants carrying each seed are not equally expressed at the different time-points , suggesting a seed-specific role in the modulation of the age-related genes.

to assess the possible seed-specificity in the modulation of the age-related transcriptome, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of mir- <dig> variants and that of the age-related genes at different ages through life. first, we generated a list of candidate age-related genes through a multiple regression analysis of the gene expression profiles using age as the predicted variable . we then identified the mir- <dig> or 5'-isomir- <dig> predicted targets among the pool of age-related genes, using the targetscan  <dig>  algorithm . finally, we measured the correlation between the expression levels of age-related genes and those of the most abundant reference seed sequence  or the most abundant 5’-isomir sequence .

the negative correlation between the expression profiles of the mrnas and those of mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> was considered the readout for mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> effective/detectable gene targeting. the expression of a total of  <dig> and  <dig> age-related genes anti-correlated with that of the ref-mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> respectively , with a significantly lower number of common genes between the two mir- <dig> seeds . these results indicate that the majority of anti-correlated targets were seed-specific, which supports the notion of a selective function of each mir- <dig> variant in modulating age-related genes .

several targets have been validated for mir- <dig>  including the cyclooxygenase  <dig>   <cit> , the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein   <cit> , the amyloid precursor protein   <cit> , the enhancer of zeste homolog  <dig>   <cit>  and the map kinase phosphatase  <dig>   <cit> . of these, dusp1/mkp- <dig>  app and ezh <dig> mrnas were predicted as possible targets of both mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig>  transfection of sh-sy5y cells with either mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> mimics slightly decreased mrna levels of cox- <dig>  mcl- <dig>  app and dusp <dig>  compared with cells transfected with a scrambled-control sequence, although the differences observed were not statistically significant . in contrast, mir- <dig> expression significantly decreased ezh <dig> mrna levels, by 40%. a tendency for ezh <dig> down-regulation by mir- <dig> was also detected in the microarrays . these findings corroborate previous results showing that mir- <dig> repressed the expression of certain genes at the protein level  <cit> , while only ezh <dig> mrna showed decay  <cit> . our data indicate that, although similar amounts of mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> were delivered into neuronal cells, 5’-isomir- <dig> inhibited ezh <dig> mrna expression by 20%, suggesting that this variant is functional.

to further confirm 5’-isomir- <dig> functionality we determined the effect of mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> mimics on the expression of cox- <dig>  mcl- <dig>  app, ezh <dig> and mkp- <dig> at the protein level . we found that comparable expression levels of exogenously transfected mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> in sh-sy5y cells decreased the expression of all proteins. however, mir- <dig> produced a significantly higher down-regulation of the proteins studied compared with 5’-isomir- <dig> . in sh-sy5y cells, mir- <dig> repressed the expression of cox- <dig>  mcl- <dig>  ezh <dig>  app and mkp- <dig> at the same levels as those reported in other cell systems  <cit> .

the decreased silencing activity of 5’-isomir- <dig> agrees with the reduced binding of this variant to ago <dig> complexes. to further confirm that the target mrnas were less represented in the risc, we transfected sh-sy5y cells with 3’biotinylated mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> mimics and subsequently pulled down the complexes with streptavidin. both 3’biotinylated-mir- <dig> and 3’biotinylated-5’-isomir- <dig> interacted with the mrna of the five genes analyzed in the present study, although higher mrna levels were found in the 3’biotinylated-mir- <dig> pulldowns .

discussion
high-throughput sequencing has revealed the existence of mirna sequence variants for virtually all mirnas in many species and tissues and in both physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . this scenario suggests a functional role for isomirs that may introduce a new layer of complexity in gene expression regulation. here, we characterized the functionality of a highly abundant type of mir- <dig> variant that differs in the seed region. mir- <dig> has mainly been studied for its tumor suppressive functions, by directly targeting ezh <dig>  cox- <dig>  mcl- <dig> and fos  <cit> . mir- <dig> has also been shown to modulate the expression of target genes involved in inflammatory processes  <cit> , autophagy  <cit>  and angiogenesis  <cit> . in addition, our analysis showing the regulated expression of mir- <dig> in brain development and ageing and in a neurodegenerative process suggests important roles for this mirna in nervous system physiology and pathology. reinforcing this idea, genes that are relevant in brain function including app  <cit>  and atx <dig>  <cit>  are proven targets of mir- <dig> 

for the majority of mirnas, the most abundant isomirs include 3’-trimming variants and nucleotide additions in the 3’-end  <cit> , suggesting that modifications in the 3’ end are more permissive. in contrast, the diversity and abundance of isomirs affecting the 5’-end of mature mirnas  is considerably reduced, which may be indicative of an increased impact of these variants in biological processes. in fact, mirna 5’-trimming variants show a modified seed region  which is one of the major determinants defining target genes  <cit> . thus, for a given mirna, isomirs expressed in high amounts which differ in the seed region are expected to have some impact on gene expression regulation. our results show that among all the sequences mapping onto mir- <dig>  5’-trimming variants affecting a single nucleotide position are highly abundant in human samples and show variable expression depending on the sample. this suggests that the biogenesis and/or stability of mir- <dig> isomirs are dependent on the cell context. 5’-trimming isomirs may be generated by variations of the dicer-cutting site on the precursor mirna. in support of this idea, both types of mir- <dig> variants are strongly and similarly decreased  when analyzing publicly available srna sequencing datasets in mcf- <dig> cells knocked down for dicer  <cit> . recent results indicate that dicer activity can be modulated by a number of proteins, interacting either with dicer or with mirna precursors  <cit> . thus, whether differential modulation of dicer activity in diverse cell types and/or physiological conditions is underlying the relative abundance of 5’-trimming mir- <dig> isomirs is an open question that deserves specific research.

another possible mechanism accounting for the differential abundance of all variants mapping onto mir- <dig> may be related to the stability of the mature forms. it has been shown that the post-transcriptional addition of non-genome-encoded nucleotides to the 3’ end of mature mirna increases mirna stability or abundance  <cit> . however, the proportion of species with 3’-nucleotide additions mapping as mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> did not correlate with the differential mir-101/5’-isomirs- <dig> relative abundance detected in the samples examined . this suggests that nucleotide additions may not be a major explanation for the differential relative abundance.

several findings indicate that mir- <dig> 5’-trimming variants are functional silencing srna: i) both 5’-isomir- <dig> mimic and endogenous 5’-isomir- <dig> were loaded into ago <dig> immunocomplexes, ii) biotin-streptavidin pull-down showed that 5’-isomir- <dig> binds to both ago <dig> and rck/p <dig> risc components iii) biotinylated 5’-isomir- <dig> pull-down assays purified known mir- <dig> target mrnas and iv) 5’-isomir- <dig> mimic inhibited the expression of known mir- <dig> targets.

in trying to identify possible candidates that are differentially modulated by mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig>  high-throughput array-based approach failed to show significant regulation of mrnas by either variant. it may be that mir- <dig> modulates gene expression mainly at the translational level, producing mild effects on rna levels that are difficult to verify in a microarray approach. in spite of this, the arrays identified a small number of genes that were regulated by only one type of variant. in addition, the non-overlapping anti-correlation between the expression profiles of mir- <dig> variants and a number of age-related genes in the human brain agrees with specific mir-101- and 5’-isomir- <dig> gene targeting. although selective functions of the seed variants may add complexity to mir- <dig> regulatory effect, it has been proposed that isomirs function cooperatively to target common biological pathways  <cit> . in agreement with this suggestion, the high number of commonly predicted targets indicates that similar biological pathways are regulated by isomir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> 

a number of results suggest that 5’-isomir- <dig> is less efficient than mir- <dig> in gene silencing: i) determinations of 5’-isomir- <dig> and mir- <dig> with highly specific rt-pcr assays in ips of endogenous ago <dig> indicate that mir- <dig> is more efficiently loaded into the risc, although the analysis of sh-sy5y small rna sequencing data suggests that 5’-isomirs- <dig> are more abundant than the reference mir-101; ii) increased amounts of mir- <dig> were also detected in ago <dig> ips of sh-sy5y cells transfected with equivalent quantities of mir- <dig> or 5’-isomir- <dig> mimics; iii) biotinylated mir- <dig> bound increased amounts of both ago <dig> and rck/p <dig> risc members compared with biotinylated 5’-isomir- <dig> and iv) 5’-isomir- <dig> showed a decreased ability to inhibit several mir- <dig> targets. overall, these data indicate that the silencing activity of mir- <dig> variants is related to their efficient loading into the risc and further suggest that the amount of the different mir- <dig> variants expressed within a cell does not strictly correlate with the quantities detected in the ago <dig> complexes. since ago <dig> is the only ago with mrna slicing activity, decreased loading of 5’-isomir- <dig> onto ago <dig> may explain the less efficient gene silencing of at least some target genes showing rna destabilization. however, the reduced loading of 5’-isomir- <dig> in ago <dig> and ago <dig> detected in monocytic human cells suggests that less efficient binding to other agos may contribute to the decreased silencing at the protein level. it has been shown that the 5’-terminal residue in a mirna influences its loading into the risc, with terminal 5’-u enhancing the ago <dig> complex  <cit> . thus, the 5’ terminal g in the isomir may provide a less efficient incorporation into the risc.

our analysis suggests that the relative amount of the two main mir- <dig> seeds was not equivalent in the different agos in monocytic human cells. it has recently been shown that a subset of mirnas give rise to distinct isomirs which associate mainly with distinct ago proteins, both in plants  <cit>  and in human samples  <cit> , supporting an isomir-dependent differential output in gene silencing.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that 5’-isomir- <dig> is a functional silencing small rna. we propose that in addition to specific gene targeting, 5’-isomir- <dig> variants present a subtle effect through regulatory mechanisms involving decreased silencing efficiency. changes in the relative expression of seeds ratios may provide scenarios for isomir-selective qualitative and quantitative gene expression regulation. this may add complexity to the fine-tuned nature of mirna regulation of gene expression.

the mechanisms by which mir- <dig> variants are generated and a full characterization of the repertoire of targets modulated by mir- <dig> and 5’-isomir- <dig> may shed light on the respective biological function. extensive study of these aspects will broaden our understanding of the overall biological impact of isomirs in different tissues and physiological states.
