BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, food-borne pathogen which is able to grow at low temperatures down to  <dig> °c  <cit> . it is widely distributed in nature and mainly affects immunocompromised individuals. a hallmark of this facultative intracellular pathogen is its capability to use eukaryotic cells as a predominant growth niche  <cit> .

l. monocytogenes entry into epithelial cells is mediated by several cell surface proteins including internalin a and b  <cit> . the phagosomal membrane is then disrupted by the activity of a hemolysin and phospholipases, resulting in the release of l. monocytogenes into the cytosol of its host cell where it encounters an environment of undefined composition. there, the pathogen is able to move intra- and intercellular by expressing acta which polymerizes host actin molecules. the genes required for these steps of the infection cycle are under control of the central transcription regulator prfa  <cit> . while these virulence factors have been extensively studied in the last years, far less is known about the availability of nutrients in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, and the specific metabolic adaptations of l. monocytogenes including substrate acquisition that allow its efficient proliferation within this cellular compartment  <cit> . the knowledge of the gene set involved in the multiplication of l. monocytogenes inside epithelial cells might also help to discover its metabolic achilles' heel as a prerequisite to control its intracellular lifestyle and to combat this medically important pathogen.

in a pilot study on virulent strains or mutants of l. monocytogenes auxotrophic for amino acids and nucleobases, it was revealed that hosts can provide sufficient organic and inorganic compounds to overcome selected auxotrophies with respect to uracil, phenylalanine, glycine, proline, or nicotinic acid  <cit> . in contrast, the synthesis of all three aromatic amino acids and adenine is essential for efficient cytosolic replication in j774a. <dig> macrophage cells. some further factors involved in nutrient uptake and metabolism have also been shown to be necessary for intracellular survival and proliferation of pathogenic l. monocytogenes. by screening a library of tn917-lac insertion mutants, the specific induction of genes for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis as well as for arginine uptake in macrophages was observed  <cit> . reduced replication has been demonstrated for a mutant of the prfa-dependent gene hpt whose product is involved in the exploitation of hexose phosphate from the host cell  <cit> . the use of host-derived lipoic acid has also been shown to be required for intracellular replication and virulence of l. monocytogenes. a mutant lacking the lipoate protein ligase lpla <dig> was less virulent in the mouse model, probably due to a loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase function whose e <dig> subunit is modified by lpla <dig>  <cit> . in two independent transcriptomic approaches following infection of macrophages and epithelial cells, it was demonstrated that the pentose phosphate cycle, but not glycolysis is the predominant pathway of listerial metabolism in the cellular host environment  <cit> . induced synthesis of the branched chain amino acids and the utilization of alternative carbon sources such as glycerol were also observed in these studies. the absence of the entner-doudoroff pathway and a bifurcated citric acid cycle due to the lack of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity were predicted by genome analysis and then experimentally demonstrated  <cit> . little is known about the in vivo nitrogen metabolism of l. monocytogenes that is assumed to use ammonium, arginine or ethanolamine as an alternative nitrogen source during intracellular replication  <cit> . results with amino acids-deprived tissue culture cells and a l. monocytogenes mutant auxotrophic for threonine indicate that this pathogen may utilize intracellular peptides as a source of amino acids  <cit> . this assumption is supported by oppa encoding an oligopeptide permease that is involved in intra-macrophagic survival, indicating that the efficient uptake of oligopeptides favours growth of l. monocytogenes in macrophages  <cit> . listerial growth within eukaryotic cells also depends on vitamins. both the uptake of thiamine and the de novo biosynthesis of its precursors have recently been shown to contribute to intracellular proliferation, a finding that reflects the role of thiamine as a cofactor of enzymes involved in central metabolic processes such as the pentose-phosphate cycle or the synthesis of branched chain amino acids  <cit> . furthermore, the listerial genome harbours the genes for cobalamine biosynthesis required for intracellular ethanolamine degradation  <cit> .

to obtain an overview of genes required by l. monocytogenes to efficiently replicate in mammalian cells, we established a mutant library of l. monocytogenes by insertion duplication mutagenesis  and screened  <dig> mutants for impaired capacity to invade or replicate within caco- <dig> cells. a total of  <dig> mutants were isolated, most of them involved in metabolism, in transport and in cell wall functions. all mutants showed wildtype-like growth in nutrient-rich medium, indicating the compartment-specific role of the genes tested. mathematical modelling then allowed to improve our understanding of the complex data obtained. the overall results shed further light on the set of listerial genes required for the replication in the cytosol of epithelial cells, and on the environment that l. monocytogenes encounters within host cells.

RESULTS
 <dig> genes were identified that affect cell invasion or intracellular replication
for the identification of insertional mutations that affect the ability of l. monocytogenes egd to proliferate within eukaryotic cells,  <dig> l. monocytogenes insertion mutants were screened for a phenotype in a caco- <dig> cell infection assay.  <dig> mutants that exhibited invasion defects or reduced intracellular replication rates in at least three independent experiments were identified. as the insertion of plsv <dig> into the chromosome leads to slight growth deficiencies, the intracellular growth data of a random group of more than  <dig> idm mutants were collected  <cit> , and an at least two-fold attenuation with respect to the average data of the control group was set as a threshold. all mutants were then grown in bhi medium to exclude unspecific growth deficiencies, and only mutants exhibiting wildtype-like growth were considered for further analysis. sequence analysis revealed that in these mutants,  <dig> different gene loci had been targeted by idm . the remaining mutants carried insertions of identical fragments or fragments of genes that had already been identified. as indicated in table  <dig>   <dig> of the genes identified have recently been described due to the fact that their transcription is upregulated during replication of l. monocytogenes in caco- <dig> cells or macrophages, while the expression of  <dig> other genes is reduced in these eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

validation by in-frame deletions
although idm has the potential for termination-induced reduction of downstream gene expression  <cit> , a real-time rt-pcr approach revealed that regardless of its orientation, plasmid plsv <dig> insertion did not significantly affect the transcription of the most distantly located genes of the operons investigated  <cit> . moreover, genes clustered in an operon are often involved in the same cellular pathway or function . to nevertheless further validate the data obtained, a series of ten non-polar deletion mutants were constructed. with the exception of lmo <dig> expressing a putative protein kinase, genes selected for deletion encode proteins that belong to the classes of cell wall biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. in all but one case, a five- to tenfold reduction in levels of intracellular replication within caco- <dig> cells in comparison to the wildtype strain was observed . egdΔlmo1031- <dig> showed a more modest reduction of replication, thus confirming the result of a recent study on listerial glycerol metabolism  <cit> . egdΔlmo0135- <dig> is an example for a very strong attenuation of the intracellular proliferation rate . the experiments were also performed with an moi of approximately  <dig>  resulting in similar intracellular attenuation rates . taken together, each of the in-frame deletions led to intracellular growth attenuation, thus confirming the mutagenesis strategy applied.

classification of listerial genes required for invasion of and replication in caco- <dig> cells
all genes were classified into functional categories .  <dig> insertions into functional unknown genes were identified. another striking feature of the classification is that  <dig> of the mutated genes belong to the class of transporters and lipoproteins, among them several uptake systems for sugars. at least five of the transporters isolated are possibly involved in the uptake of amino acids and oligopeptides . two of a total of ten antimicrobial permeases encoded by the listerial genome were also identified. a huge set of  <dig> genes are involved in intermediary metabolism, among them  <dig> genes contributing to the utilization of carbohydrates such as glucose, glycerol, or fucose, and  <dig> to the metabolism of amino acids . interestingly, genes of the two groups cell envelope/cellular processes including transport  and intermediary metabolism  are overrepresented, and genes of unknown function  underrepresented with respect to their quota in the entire genome .

eight genes identified in the screening described here have no homologue in the apathogenic species l. innocua , indicating that their products might specifically contribute to virulence properties of l. monocytogenes. this group includes one l. monocytogenes-specific gene , lmo <dig> required for teichoic acid synthesis, and several metabolic genes such as lmo <dig> encoding a glucosidase  or lmo <dig> possibly involved in fucose utilization.

genes involved in invasion of epithelial cells, and cell surface genes
to discriminate between factors playing a role during intracellular multiplication from those that contribute to caco- <dig> cell adhesion or invasion, the number of viable surface-attached or intracellular l. monocytogenes cells  <dig> minutes or two hours after infection was determined for all mutants selected above. only mutants affected in their adhesion or invasion capabilities are expected to be identified by this approach. as bacterial entrance is a continuous process and cannot strictly be separated from the intracellular replication phase, only four mutants with an at least five-fold reduced number of intracellular bacteria two hours post infection were classified as invasion deficient. further analysis of the plasmid insertion site revealed ami, lmo <dig> encoding a putative d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase, oppf encoding a membrane protein with similarity to an abc transporter, and vip  .

modelling
the main anabolic and catabolic pathways of l. monocytogenes such as glycolysis, starch degradation, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle , the metabolism of lipids and nucleic acids, and the biosynthesis of essential amino acids were reconstructed as described above, including consideration of important transporters . upon data mining, additional genes were found in the literature to play a role during intracellular replication.  <dig> of them were further considered due to the availability of quantitative data . from table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>   <dig> genes where selected whose mutation resulted in an at least  <dig> -fold reduction of the intracellular replication rate  and used for a simulation of the listerial metabolism during intracellular replication .

flux balance analysis  <cit>  was applied to identify pathways critical for intracellular survival. flux balance analysis assumes a steady state for all metabolites internal to the system. given all biochemical reactions in a network, for each flux pathway in the network an equilibrium condition for each internal metabolite used by the different enzymes of this pathway has to be satisfied. solving this balancing condition for all biochemical reactions in the network, the so called stochiometric matrix, directly enumerates all possible stable pathways of the system allowing equilibrium for their respective internal metabolites. two types of calculation are possible:  all possible pathways in the system which satisfy the balancing condition and cannot be split further. these are used for elementary mode analysis .  the extreme pathway analysis : a minimal set of pathways  that can completely describe the whole system by linear combinations of these fewer epa pathways. they are termed extreme pathways because unique use of one of these pathways marks a boundary or extreme situation of the complete space of possibilities. while epa is faster, one looses some solutions from ema, in particular all those elementary pathways that are not at the boundary of the system but within it.

the metabolic model allows to identify all cellular pathways affected by each knockout mutation. applying perl scripts, we identified the number of mutants impairing the same pathway. finally, all pathways relevant to intracellular survival were ranked with the highest redundancy at the top, and the key enzymes involved were listed . a condensed view of these results is given in figure  <dig> 

metabolic pathways severely affected by knockout mutations are the biosynthesis of valine/leucine/isoleucine, the purine, fucose, glycerol and lipid metabolism, lower glycolysis as well as serine and glutathione production and aspartate semialdehyde biosynthesis. it is important to note that on the other hand, a huge landscape of central metabolism is not important for intracellular growth. this demonstrates not only the robustness of these central metabolic pathways, but also the difference in the phenotypes revealed by the comparison of growth in full medium with the intracellular replication. the overview from epa indicates that the glycerol metabolism is most critical for intracellular survival. further genes important for intracellular replication of l. monocytogenes are serc, lmo <dig>  glpd and three genes involved in purine synthesis . the gene lmo <dig> encodes a critical enzyme for glycolysis , glpd encodes a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase which plays an important role in the lipid metabolism. in addition to serc, the purine operon, and lmo <dig> , the more extensive ema also suggests arob to be critical for the intracellular survival. in addition to the result of epa, glpd revealed to be less important for the system. this discrepancy might be explained by considering glycerol-3-phosphate as an intermediate metabolite for the glycolysis. on the other hand, lmo <dig> putatively involved in fucose metabolism appears more important than argd for the cytoplasmic survival of l. monocytogenes as determined by ema.

ispe and the transporter lmo0135- <dig> are required in vivo
l. monocytogenes mutants exhibiting intracellular growth deficiencies are often attenuated in vivo. eight of the deletion mutants described above were therefore tested for their virulence properties in the balb/c mouse infection model. for this purpose, groups of five 8- to 10-week-old female balb/c mice were infected as described with a sub-lethal dose of the deletion mutants. mice generally showed some signs of disease after three days of infection. at day three post infection with egdΔlmo0135- <dig> and egdΔispe, the bacterial load of mice was significantly  reduced in spleen and liver compared to mice infected with the wildtype-strain . the reduction was approximately one log <dig> in the spleen  and more than  <dig>  log <dig> in the liver , respectively. we also determined the bacterial loads of mice infected with the strains egdΔlmo0135- <dig> and egdΔispe six days after infection, and again observed an attenuation of these mutants compared to the wildtype strain . gene ispe  encodes a 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate  synthase involved in the alternative non-mevalonate  pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . the operon lmo0135- <dig> encodes a cysteine uptake-associated abc-transporter  <cit> . it corresponds to a number of modes in the model , thus supporting the importance of this route for the metabolic network.

the strains egdΔlmo <dig>  egdΔlmo <dig> and egdΔlmo <dig> also showed a minor reduction of bacterial counts, which was more pronounced in the spleen  than in the liver . this trend to reduced bacterial loads, however, was not statistically significant. in the case of the remaining strains egdΔoppf, egdΔlmo <dig> and egdΔtagb, no reduction of bacterial counts compared to mice infected with strain egd was observed , although oppf is induced during mouse infection  <cit> .

discussion
recently, two independent studies have disclosed the expression profile of l. monocytogenes during infection of caco- <dig> cells and macrophages  <cit> . however, the up- or down-regulation of a gene under certain conditions does not always correlate with a phenotype of the respective mutant, possibly due to the high number of parameters changed, physiological side effects, catabolite repression, or transcriptional activities without impact. to overcome these limitations, we decided to complement our knowledge of listerial intracellular behaviour by the screening of a comprehensive mutant library, and report the results of a search for l. monocytogenes genes required during infection of and replication in human epithelial cells. this experimental genetic screen under defining conditions was finally combined with bioinformatic modelling.

surface proteins
ami, vip, and inla are well known virulence factors that contribute to listerial adhesion to and invasion of eukaryotic cells, and there identification validates the screening procedure. ami is an autolysin amidase involved in adhesion to epithelial cells  <cit> , and inla and vip are required for entry into several non-phagocytic eukaryotic cells  <cit> . besides inla and vip, four hypothetical cell surface proteins with lpxtg motif have been identified in this screening, namely lmo <dig>  and the internalin-like proteins lmo <dig>  lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig>  <cit> . a lack of these four proteins affected the capability of strain egd to invade caco- <dig> cells only slightly, but a tissue-specific phenotype of these mutants as recently shown for lmo <dig> that plays a role during listerial multiplication in the brain cannot be excluded  <cit> . an lmo <dig> mutant has been shown to grow wildtype-like in j <dig> macrophages and, in contrast to our data, also in caco-2-derived c2bbe <dig> cells  <cit> .

virulence-related factors
several of the genes that play a role intracellular replication as identified here are also known to be required for virulence of l. monocytogenes or other pathogens in mice. upon application of signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis, a homologue of agra encoding a response regulator involved in staphylococcus aureus virulence  <cit> , has recently been identified as virulence factor of l. monocytogenes, because its mutation resulted in a ten-fold increase in the 50% lethal dosis  <cit> . in contrast to this study, idm inactivation of agra resulted in a  <dig> -fold attenuation of l. monocytogenes in caco- <dig> cells, a discrepancy that might be explained by experimental conditions such as the moi used. the inactivation of sipx  encoding a type i signal peptidase resulted in an eight-fold reduction of the intracellular multiplication of l. monocytogenes  and also significantly affected the listerial virulence  <cit> . a deletion of fur responsible for oxidative stress response and iron storage led to a strong reduction of listerial virulence, but did not affect the growth of strain egd-e in macrophages  <cit> . our data clearly show the requirement of ispe for l. monocytogenes virulence, thus confirming a recent study that investigated mutants in other isoprenoid synthesis genes to demonstrate an in vivo role of the mep pathway  <cit> . listerial ispe exhibits a 62% similarity to ispe of bacillus cereus and is highly conserved among l. monocytogenes strains. in contrast to our infection studies with caco- <dig> cells , isoprenoid biosynthesis is not required for listerial growth in macrophages  <cit> . interestingly, ispe has been described as a novel protein target that elicits a strong antibody response from antiserum from rabbits infected with l. monocytogenes, suggesting that this protein is induced or upregulated during infection  <cit> . three genes belonging to the category of membrane bioenergetics, namely lmo <dig> and atpa/atpb, encode subunits of two atp synthases for which a role in virulence has been demonstrated in francisella novicida  <cit> . lmo <dig>  encoding a lysine decarboxylase, probably contributes to acid resistance by consuming intracellular protons  <cit> .

transporters
a surprisingly high number of genes involved in various transport processes contribute to the intracellular replication of l. monocytogenes, justifying their consideration in the metabolism model . obviously, the eukaryotic cytosol is exploited by the bacterium for osmoprotectants and nutrients such as sugars, phosphate and amino acids. this is in line with the assumption that within cells, l. monocytogenes utilizes sugars besides phosphorylated glucose, and intracellular peptides as a source of amino acids  <cit> . mutant egdΔlmo135- <dig> lacking the transporter lmo0135- <dig> associated with cysteine transport is growth attenuated in caco- <dig> cells. this finding is in line with the assumption that the uptake of amino acids such as alanine, aspartate and glutamate from the host cell is a requirement for intracellular replicating of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . a similar observation has been made for oppabcdf essential for oligopeptide uptake. an oppa mutant showed retarded growth in macrophages and affects growth at low temperature  <cit> . lmo <dig> , but not oppabcdf, is essential for full virulence of l. monocytogenes in mice  <cit> , suggesting a lack of available cysteine during systemic infection. in contrast to the oligopeptide-binding protein oppa of l. monocytogenes  <cit> , lmo0135- <dig> does not mediate the transport of bialaphos, because strain egdΔlmo0135- <dig> showed a wildtype-like susceptibility of this toxic tripeptide . four other loci in the genome of l. monocytogenes are predicted to be involved in peptide uptake, namely dtpt, lmo <dig>  lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig> upregulated in macrophages  <cit> , but the activity of only two of them has been disclosed  <cit> .

the requirement of lmo <dig> involved in ferrichrome transport, as well as of the iron uptake regulator fur, points to a restriction of iron availability inside the cytosol, a finding that has also been reported for shigella flexneri during intramacrophagic growth  <cit> . within epithelial cells, l. monocytogenes competes for phosphate as shown by the identification of lmo <dig> encoding a low-affinity inorganic phosphate transporter. the uptake of glycine betaine by gbua- and opuca-encoded transporters  <cit>  contributes to osmotolerance of l. monocytogenes and thus to intracellular proliferation.

metabolism
four genes involved in the synthesis of purines  and pyrimidines  are required for intracellular proliferation of l. monocytogenes, suggesting that these bases and nucleotides are not provided by the host cell, but must be synthesized by the bacterium. two further genes identified here, pdxk and lmo <dig>  are involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine, a vitamin that contributes to transaminase activities during amino acid degradation. this observation also stresses that amino acid metabolism plays a key role for intracellular replication of l. monocytogenes, a finding that is supported by our network analysis of key flux modes for intracellular survival. a mutation in nadb demonstrate the requirement of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism during multiplication in caco- <dig> cells, although a niacin-auxotrophic mutant of l. monocytogenes revealed no growth deficiencies following macrophage infection  <cit> .

with respect to amino acid metabolism, the genes listed in table  <dig>  and the corresponding flux mode analysis , show that besides the de novo biosynthesis of all aromatic and branched chain amino acids and arginine  <cit> , an intact metabolism of methionine  and serine  is required for multiplication of l. monocytogenes within caco- <dig> cells.

the identification of lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> that encode a phosphoglycerate mutase and a phosphoglucomutase, respectively, support the finding that the pentose phosphate cycle rather than glycolysis is the predominant pathway of sugar metabolism of l. monocytogenes during proliferation in epithelial cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an important outcome of the systems biology approach described here is the fact that l. monocytogenes overcomes several nutrient limitations within the epithelial cytosol by the expression of genes mainly involved in transport processes and in the metabolism of sugars, cofactors and nucleic acids. although this pathogen is assumed to encounter a nutrient-rich surrounding after escape from the phagosome, it requires a surprisingly high number of metabolic pathways and factors during intracytosolic replication. their identity became apparent by combining a genetic screen with flux mode calculations. as a result of this metabolic modelling, we could show that listeria pathways for intracytoplasmatic survival are clearly distinct from the central set of genes essential for survival under optimal metabolic conditions, e.g. in full medium. certain metabolic capabilities revealed to be important for intracellular survival, while the respective mutants did not show a phenotype in full medium. the results obtained are in line with the assumption that intracellular bacteria avoid the competition with the substrate requirements of their host cell, but prefer to use excess, storage, or garbage products of the cytosol  <cit> . only few mutants identified in this screen were also attenuated in the mouse infection model, indicating that l. monocytogenes uses a huge number of partially redundant pathways and nutrient acquisition strategies, all of which contribute to its highly physiological flexibility within in vivo compartments.
