BACKGROUND
the family picornaviridae is a large family of viruses classified into several genera with extensive diversity in physical properties, antigenicity and mechanisms of pathogenesis
 <cit> . although there are many different picornaviruses with various degrees of relatedness, all share several features in common. the picornaviruses have a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome with a 5'-end covalently linked to a vpg  protein. the rna genome contains a 5′ untranslated region  with an internal ribosome entry site , a single open reading frame  encoding the viral capsid proteins and the viral replicase proteins, a 3′ utr and a 3′ poly tail
 <cit> . the orf is divided into three regions: p <dig> encodes four structural proteins ; p <dig>  and p <dig>  encode nine non-structural proteins
 <cit> . a key component of the replication machinery is the rna-dependent rna polymerase , also referred to as 3d polymerase  in picornaviruses. this protein is responsible for the synthesis of both plus- and minus-strand viral rna
 <cit> . equine picornaviruses, formerly known as equine rhinoviruses  <dig> and  <dig>  have been reclassified as equine rhinitis a virus  and equine rhinitis b virus . erav , a member of the genus aphthovirus in the family picornaviridae, was first isolated in the united kingdom in 1962
 <cit> . the genome organization and structure of erav is very similar to that of other picornaviruses . the second equine rhinitis virus, erbv  was first isolated in switzerland and subsequent sequence determination resulted in it being classified in a new genus erbovirus, also in the family picornaviridae <cit> . there are three erbv serotypes  that are differentiated on the basis of their acid lability/stability, genetic sequences and neutralization by type-specific antisera. the erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> serotypes comprise two distinct phylogenetic groups, one of which is phenotypically acid labile  and the other is acid stable . subsequently, a third equine rhinovirus virus  was also isolated in switzerland and following sequence analysis of its viral capsid proteins, it was shown to be a second serotype in the genus erbovirus, and was designated as erbv <dig> 
 <cit> .

strains of erav, erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> have been identified from both subclinical and clinical upper respiratory tract infections in horses worldwide
 <cit> . little is known about the pathogenesis of erav and erbv, which could be attributable in part to the lack of suitable laboratory methods for the diagnosis of these infectious agents. seroprevalence data reported by different investigators indicate that neutralizing antibodies to erav and erbv can be found in 50% to 80% of horses worldwide and the seropositive percentage seems to be correlated with the age of the animals
 <cit> . most erav, erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> isolates were recovered from horses with acute febrile respiratory disease with clinical signs of high fever for 1–3 days, serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, anorexia, leg edema and enlarged lymph nodes of the head and neck that were sensitive on palpation. a significant number of horses may carry and shed virus in their urine for an extended period of time
 <cit> . subclinical infection and subsequent seroconversion have also been reported
 <cit> .

the clinical signs of equine influenza virus , equine herpesvirus- <dig> and - <dig> , equine adenovirus  <dig> , equine arteritis virus , and equine rhinitis a and b  infections are very similar and resemble a number of other infectious and non-infectious equine respiratory diseases
 <cit> . accordingly, a provisional clinical diagnosis based solely on the respiratory signs must be confirmed by laboratory testing. furthermore, rapid and accurate identification of these viruses is critical for the control of the diseases they cause. therefore, the development of rapid, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is essential for the identification and differentiation of erav and erbv in infected horses during outbreaks of disease. in addition, such assays would facilitate epidemiological investigations.

traditionally, erav and erbv have been detected by virus isolation  in susceptible cells lines such as african green monkey kidney  or rabbit kidney- <dig>  cells. sources of these viruses can include nasal swabs, blood, feces and urine
 <cit> . vi can be challenging because some strains of these viruses may grow poorly in cell culture and may not give rise to visible cytopathic effect
 <cit> . a modified culture medium supplemented with mgcl <dig> can enhance the growth of some erbv strains, but it is unsuitable for diagnostic purposes due to lack of sensitivity
 <cit> . furthermore, successful vi frequently requires multiple blind passages and subsequent confirmation by electron microscopy or immunofluorescence testing in the case of non-cytopathic strains. erav and erbv infection can also be detected serologically by demonstration of a four-fold or greater rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent  sera by virus neutralization
 <cit>  or complement fixation tests
 <cit> , however, serology might not be helpful in acute outbreak situations due to the time delay of the convalescent result. furthermore, these traditional serologic techniques, although sensitive and specific, are time consuming and tedious. several rapid molecular tests such as conventional rt-pcr  and real-time rt-pcr  have been developed for erav and erbv
 <cit> . the primers used in these assays were located in the 3dpol, 3'-utr, 5'-utr or vp1-2a regions of the viral genome. in the present study, we developed a panel of three new rrt-pcr assays for erav and erbv targeting the 5'-utr region of each viral genome, respectively. in addition, to facilitate more diagnostic flexibility, a panel of six crt-pcr assays targeting the 5'-utr and 3dpol regions of erav or erbv was also developed. this would allow diagnostic laboratories that do not have functional real-time rt-pcr assays to diagnose erav and erbv infections in horses.

RESULTS
development of rrt-pcr assays for the detection of erav and erbv
three erav and erbv specific primer and probe sets were developed targeting the conserved 5'-utr region of the viral genomes . one primer and probe set was specific for erav  and the primers were degenerated to accommodate nucleotide variations found in sequences that are available in genbank . the second primer and probe set  was specific for erbv <dig> strain. a third assay  consisted of the same reverse primer and probe sequences as in the erbv <dig> assay with the exception that the forward primer was specific for erbv <dig>  the 4-nucleotide difference in the forward primer between the erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> assays was designed to increase the likelihood of detection of erbv <dig> strains. three rrt-pcr assays were initially tested with prototype strains of erav and erbv obtained from the usda’s national veterinary services laboratories , ames, ia. all the assays were optimized using rna extracted from the prototype strains of erav and erbv and with different primers and probe concentrations using taqman® one-step rt-pcr master mix in a checkerboard assay. the optimal primer and probe concentrations producing the greatest sensitivity and specificity for detection of erav and erbv were selected for the final assay as described in the materials and methods section. the erav assay detected only the erav prototype strain with a mean cycle threshold  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and no cross-reaction with the erbv prototype strain was noted. both erbv rrt-pcr assays detected only the erbv prototype strain, but not the erav strain, with a mean ct value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for the erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assay and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for the erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assay, respectively. subsequently, the specificity of these assays was tested using a range of other equine respiratory viruses including eav, eiv, eadv <dig> and  <dig>  ehv 1- <dig> and salem virus. the assays were shown to be 100% specific with no cross-reactivity with nucleic acid extracted from the afore-mentioned equine respiratory pathogens.

the three assays were further evaluated for detection capability using  <dig> archived erav  or erbv  isolates whose identity was previously confirmed in a one-way neutralization test using mono-specific rabbit antisera
 <cit> . all three assays identified the erv subtype accurately and no cross-reactivity between subtypes were observed. the mean ct values of erav, erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assays are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively. both erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assays could detect two previously well characterized erbv <dig> isolates 
 <cit> . none of the erbv <dig> or erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assays were able to distinguish viral rna between erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> serotypes tested in the study. overall, the two assays designed to distinguish erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> serotypes were able to detect the nvsl prototype strain of erbv, indicating that the nucleotide mismatches in the forward primer were not sufficiently definitive to provide serotype specificity. this was further confirmed by their inability to distinguish the archived isolates as erbv <dig> or erbv <dig> serotype.

previously quinlivan et al.  developed two taqman® rrt-pcr assays targeting the conserved region of the 5'-utr of the erv genomes 
 <cit> . these two assays were also tested with rna extracted from each of the two prototype strains of erav and erbv, as well as tcf of  <dig> archived field isolates. the assay targeting erav could detect the erav prototype strain and the  <dig> erav positive isolates without cross-reacting with any erbv samples. the mean ct value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which was lower than the erav assay developed in our laboratory , indicating that this published erav assay is more sensitive in detecting the field isolates than the erav rrt-pcr assay developed in this study. in contrast, the assay targeting erbv could not detect any of the erbv isolates or the prototype strain of erbv. this assay also did not cross-react with erav strains evaluated in this study. however, the reagents used in this study were not identical to those reported in the original publication by quinlivan et al. ; this may also have contributed to the reduced sensitivity and failure to detect of erbv rna in the erbv rrt-pcr assay. in order to provide a standardized protocol that can be easily applied in different laboratories, a commercial kit and manufacturer’s recommended real-time rt-pcr cycle parameters were used in the current study.

development of crt-pcr assays for the detection of erav and erbv
to provide more diagnostic options, we developed an additional panel of six crt-pcr assays to target the 5'-utr and 3dpol regions of erav and erbv . all primers were designed to distinguish erav and erbv subtypes and were initially tested with the prototype strains of erav and erbv obtained from nvsl. all primer pairs could detect the prototype strains for which they were designed and the crt-pcr products matched their predicted sizes . the authenticity of the crt-pcr products was confirmed by sequencing. subsequently, the primers were tested with the rna extracted from archived infective erv tcf specimens. similar to the rrt-pcr results, the erav 5'-utr, erav poly  <dig> and erav poly  <dig> crt-pcr assays could detect all the erav rna from field isolates and did not cross-react with the rna from erbv isolates. the erbv poly  <dig> and erbv poly  <dig> crt-pcr assays were also highly specific for the detection of rna from erbv isolates without cross-reacting with rna from erav isolates. sequence comparison analysis between the erbv <dig> prototype p1436/ <dig>  and erbv <dig> prototype p313/ <dig>  revealed that these two strains shared  <dig> % sequence identity in the 3dpol region which is consistent with the previous findings that the 3dpol region of erbv is highly conserved and therefore commonly used for primer design
 <cit> . the high sequence similarity between erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> in the 3dpol region is good for primer design in differentiating erbv from erav; however, it may also prevent the successful differentiation of erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> serotypes. in contrast to the high sensitivity of erbv crt-pcr assays targeting the 3dpol region, the erbv crt-pcr assay targeting the 5'-utr region could only detect  <dig> out of the  <dig> erbv positive isolates . all six assays were specific for erv and did not react with other common equine respiratory viruses. therefore, we concluded that the crt-pcr assays that were developed could be used to distinguish erav from erbv but not between erbv serotypes.

previously black et al.  developed four primers for the detection of erbv rna by rt nested-pcr assay
 <cit> . we took these four primers and mix and matched them depending on their positions to generate four one-step crt-pcr assays . these four assays  could distinguish all erbv positive isolates from erav isolates included in this study. the application of one-step rt-pcr has a greater advantage over the nested rt-pcr because it eliminates the possibility of cross-contamination between samples and reduces the turnaround time.

comparison of sensitivities of the rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays
using serial decimal dilutions  of the tcf containing erav and erbv prototype strains, the detection limits of all rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays were compared . viral rna from each of the serial dilutions was eluted in 50 μl of nuclease free water and 5 μl was tested in duplicate in both rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays. the plaque number in the highest dilution was used to calculate the number of infectious particles that can be detected by each assay. the amplification efficiency of the three erav, erbv <dig> and erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assays was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, calculated according to a previously described method 
 <cit> . the erav rrt-pcr assay and erav 5'-utr crt-pcr assay could detect viral rna up to 10− <dig> dilution of erav in tcf which is approximately 1 pfu/ml infectious virus particles. the other two erav crt-pcr assays  were 10-fold less sensitive  as compared to the rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays targeting the 5'-utr regions . the erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assay could detect erbv viral rna up to 10− <dig> dilution which equals  <dig>  pfu/ml infectious virus particles. the third rrt-pcr assay targeting erbv <dig> was  <dig> logs less sensitive compared to the erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assay and could only detect more than 550 pfu/ml infectious virus particles. this suggests that the erbv <dig> rrt-pcr assay is more suitable for the detection of erbv in clinical samples. all the erbv crt-pcr assays except erbv 5'-utr crt-pcr assay could detect  <dig> to 30 pfu/ml infectious virus particles . the erbv 5'-utr crt-pcr assay was the least sensitive and could only detect virus in the 10− <dig> dilution of tcf .

a serial decimal dilutions of erav and erbv were tested in a comparison study by virus isolation in cell culture, rrt-pcr and standard rt-pcr assays. numbers shown on the table represent the serial virus dilution.

b erav and erbv prototype strains were obtained from nvsl.

c not applicable.

d the primers used in these four assays were obtained from a nested rt-pcr developed by black et al. .

overall, the rrt-pcr assays were more sensitive than the crt-pcr assays. there was approximately a 10-fold difference in the limit between the rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays in detecting erav strains. there was a significant difference in the sensitivity of the rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays targeting the erbv strains. the erbv 5'-utr crt-pcr assay was the least sensitive among all the developed assays. this might be explained by the fact that the reverse primer of the erbv 5'-utr crt-pcr assay was located in the higher order internal ribosome entry site
 <cit> . this complex sequence region may prevent efficient binding of the reverse primer to target sequences. however, no plausible explanation can be provided for the high sensitivity of the erav 5'-utr crt-pcr assay which was targeting the similar region as compared to erbv.

although erav and erbv infections are considered a common disease in horses, limited data are available about the pathogenesis and disease prevalence, which may be due in part to the absence of suitable diagnostic methods for these infections
 <cit> . currently, there are only a few molecular diagnostic tests available for the detection of these viruses including a duplex rrt-pcr developed by mori et al. 
 <cit>  and single rrt-pcr assays for erav or erbv developed by quinlivan et al. 
 <cit> . the duplex rrt-pcr by mori et al.  was developed to differentiate erav from erbv, but when tested, none of the samples were positive for erav
 <cit> . therefore the detection capability for erav using this duplex rrt-pcr assay is questionable. the single rrt-pcr assays developed by quinlivan et al.  detected  <dig> erav and  <dig> erbv positives among  <dig> nasal swab samples collected over a 7 year period
 <cit> . as we discussed above, the erbv rrt-pcr assay developed in that study was unable to detect any erbv isolates tested in this study using the current cycling conditions and rrt-pcr reagents. the assays developed in our study were tested with a limited number of well-characterized erav and erbv isolates
 <cit> . therefore, the authors of this manuscript admit that prior to the application of the assays on a routine diagnostic basis, both would need to be more fully evaluated using a larger number of clinical specimens positive for both erav and erbv.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we developed one rrt-pcr assay and three crt-pcr assays for the detection of erav and three rrt-pcr assays and three crt-pcr assays for erbv. twenty-one archived erav or erbv field isolates were used to evaluate the detection capability of the assays. both the rrt-pcr and crt-pcr assays designed for erav or erbv could detect the serotype specific isolates without cross-reacting with other equine viral pathogens. comparison of the respective sensitivities of rrt-pcr assays and crt-pcr assays confirmed that the rrt-pcr assays have the same or greater sensitivity in detecting erv in serial decimal dilutions of infective tcfs. overall, the newly developed assays provide valuable tools for the detection of erav and erbv.
