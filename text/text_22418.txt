BACKGROUND
profound climatic oscillations during the pleistocene resulted in repeated drastic environmental changes, which also substantially shaped the species’ distribution, evolution, and extinction  <cit> . the last glacial maximum  occurred at around  <dig> 000– <dig> 000 years before present, which was particularly considered an important factor influencing the current plant distribution  <cit> . numerous molecular-based phylogeographical surveys in europe and north america have been extensively studied to unravel the locations of refugia, the potential recolonization routes and the subsequent evolution and speciation during glacial and post-glacial epochs  <cit> . in contrast to europe and north america, most parts of china were not covered by massive ice sheet during lgm. it was clear that ice sheet had only developed in certain areas of the qinghai–tibetan plateau  <cit> . in recent years, numerous phylogeographical surveys of plant species in china have been informative in resolving the location of glacial refugia and routes of colonization/range expansion after glacial periods.

three hypotheses on the occurrence of refugia and postglacial expansion in china have been proposed. the first hypothesis is that climatic changes during pleistocene deeply impacted the forests in china, and large-scale vegetation experienced long-distance southward migration during glaciations. thus, the species subsequently colonized northward from the southern refugia after glaciation  <cit> . the second hypothesis is that climatic changes during pleistocene had a large influence on the forests in china; however, no large-scale vegetation experienced long-distance southward migration during glaciation and instead contracted into a few main refugia, as suggested by most phylogeographical studies in china  <cit> . the third hypothesis is that some species were slightly affected by pleistocene glacial cycles that persisted in situ throughout the lgm and occupied multiple localized glacial refugia, as suggested by some phylogeographical studies in this region on species such as taxus wallichiana <cit> , cathaya argyrophylla <cit> , and eurycorymbus cavaleriei <cit> . some species reportedly occupied a much larger area than today, e.g., alsophila spinulosa <cit> , pinus kwangtungensis <cit> , and primula obconica <cit> . nevertheless, these studies have mainly focused on the plant species in the regions with high biodiversity, such as qinghai–tibetan plateau, the himalaya–hengduan mountains, and subtropical china, and only a few studies are about china’s warm-temperate zone. however, this region has the highest population density in the country and has developed agriculture. dramatic climate change is adversely affecting the global ecological system and agricultural cultivation. therefore, more comprehensive studies on species with wide distribution ranges in china’s warm-temperate zone are needed to test the impact on this region during the pleistocene glacial cycle.

“china’s warm-temperate zone” generally refers to the area between 32°30′–42°30′ and 103°30′–124°10′. in this region, the typical vegetation is deciduous broad-leaved forest   <cit> . since the tertiary period, the warm-temperate zone in china has not been strongly influenced by massive quaternary glaciers. in contrast to the extinction of a large number of broad-leaved species in europe and north america, the majority of deciduous broad-leaved species is preserved in this region  <cit> . although they have survived the quaternary glacial period, the evolution and distribution of the warm-temperate dblf were still affected by climate fluctuations. however, our knowledge on phylogeographical histories of organisms occurring in china’s warm-temperate zone and their correlations with climatic fluctuations has been limited due to finite phylogeographical studies in this region, particularly for plants  <cit> . thus, increased attention must be paid to china’s warm-temperate zone and to the influences of quaternary climate change in this area based on large-scale genetic studies with extensive sampling.

forsythia suspensa  vahl  is a deciduous shrub widely distributed in china’s warm-temperate zone with elevations of 300 m to 2200 m above sea level. as a typical component of dblf, f. suspensa exists in most distribution areas of current dblf in china. consequently, we selected f. suspensa as a model for inferring phylogeographical patterns in china’s warm-temperate zone to understand dblf population dynamics in response to climate change.

in this study, two chloroplast dna  regions, one nuclear ribosomal dna  region, and ecological niche models were used to examine the phylogeographical pattern of f. suspensa. our specific objectives were to address the following questions:  what is the genetic structure of f. suspensa populations in china as revealed by cpdna and nrdna data; and  how did the species response to the climatic oscillations during the pleistocene.

RESULTS
cpdna diversity and population structure
out of the two cpdna regions sequenced in f. suspensa , the two regions both showed length variation . when combined, these sequences  were aligned with a consensus length of 1180 bp, and contained  <dig> nucleotide substitutions and  <dig> indels. based on these polymorphisms,  <dig> chlorotypes  were identified among all samples surveyed . the  <dig> psba-trnh and  <dig> trnl-f chlorotype sequences were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers kf <dig> to kf <dig>  among the  <dig> chlorotypes detected, the most widespread chlorotypes were c <dig>  and c <dig> . the geographical distribution of chlorotypes c <dig> to c <dig> and their occurrence at each locality are shown in figure 1b and table  <dig>  only  <dig> of the  <dig> populations were polymorphic , whereas the other populations exhibited only one chlorotype. the statistical parsimony network of chlorotypes c <dig> to c <dig> revealed that they were only one to seven mutational steps apart . the haplotype and nucleotide diversities of cpdna were ht =  <dig>  and πt =  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively. the highest nucleotide and haplotype diversities were found in p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively . seven private chlorotypes of populations were found in the species, with the highest in p <dig>

bayesian analysis of population structure  revealed that the highest likelihood of cpdna data was obtained when samples were clustered into seven groups . the seven groups identified were as follows: shandong , henan–shaanxi–shanxi  , henan–hubei–shanxi  , song mt. , wulaofeng , baota mt. , and wuzhi mt.  groups. non-hierarchical amova  revealed a strong population genetic structure for cpdna sequence variation at the species-range scale . however, most of this differentiation was partitioned among the seven groups , and only  <dig> % was explained among populations within each region  . significant isolation by geographical distance for cpdna was detected at the species-range scale . however, the isolation by ecological distance for cpdna was not significant .

tajima’s d and fu’s fs statistics for deviation from neutrality were examined for the four groups including hss, hhs, wulaofeng and baota mt., and no significant values were detected. the other three groups, including shandong, song mt. and wuzhi mt., were not calculated because each of them had a single chlorotype . similarly, mismatch analysis was also not performed for these three groups. unlike the two neutrality tests, the hss and baota mt. groups showed demographic expansions for nonsignificant ssd and rag values . according to the result of molecular clock calibration, the mean divergence time of nodes ranged from  <dig>  ma  to  <dig>  ma  or  <dig>  ma  to  <dig>  ma  , assuming, respectively, minimum and maximum rates of synonymous substitution in cpdna  <cit> . this suggests that the divergence of the species fell into the early-to-late pleistocene.

nrdna diversity and population structure
one nrdna  region was also sequenced in f. suspensa from  <dig> individuals . the aligned sequences were 481 bp and contained  <dig> nucleotide substitutions. based on these polymorphisms,  <dig> ribotypes  were identified among all samples surveyed . the sequences of the  <dig> ribotypes were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers kf <dig> to kf <dig>  among the  <dig> ribotypes detected, the most widespread haplotype was r <dig> . the geographical distribution of ribotypes r <dig> to r <dig> and their occurrence at each locality are shown in table  <dig>  nineteen of the twenty populations were polymorphic, and only p <dig> exhibited one ribotype. the haplotype and nucleotide diversities based on nrdna data for f. suspensa were ht =  <dig>  and πt =  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  respectively. nucleotide diversity  among the  <dig> populations ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and haplotype diversity  varied between  <dig> and  <dig> . the highest nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity was found in populations p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively . a total of  <dig> private ribotypes of populations existed in the species, and the highest number of private ribotype was found in p <dig>

bayesian analysis based on nrdna revealed a progressive increase in l  until k =  <dig> . however, the resulting groupings did not correspond to separate geographical regions supported by cpdna data . non-hierarchical amova and nei’s estimator of population substructure  indicated high levels of population differentiation for nrdna in f. suspensa at the species-range scale . despite taking into account the species’ weak hierarchical  substructure , overall levels of population divergence still remained high . however, no significant isolation by geographical distance  and isolation by ecological distance  were found for nrdna. using an nrdna-derived Φst  value of  <dig>  across all surveyed populations  and the corresponding value of cpdna  =  <dig> ), the pollen/seed migration ratio  was calculated as  <dig> , indicating that pollen flow was significantly higher than seed flow.

tajima’s d and fu’s fs statistics based on nrdna data were examined for each of the seven groups. shandong and hhs groups significantly deviated from neutrality. however, mismatch analysis did not support the demographic expansion of hhs group .

climatic suitability inference by ecological niche modeling
the predicted areas climatically suitable for f. suspensa for the current and past  are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the values of auc based on both training and test presence data for the present were all higher than expected by chance , demonstrating good model performance. notably, the model indicated that f. suspensa experienced habitat fragmentation isolated by intervening unsuitable habitat, and significant isolation was found between the shandong group and other groups . the area of climatically suitability value above  <dig>  from the lgm prediction  was larger than that from the current prediction . the area of climatically suitability value above  <dig>  at lgm  was also slightly larger than the current most suitable habitat . obviously climatically suitable areas expanded in the shandong group, retreated in the northern edge  and extended southward to the edge of subtropical chongqing and hubei provinces during the lgm .

discussion
genetic diversity and spatial population genetic structure
generally, geographical distribution, breeding system, and population size all affect genetic diversity in plant species  <cit> . f. suspensa is an out-crossing species that has two mechanisms for avoiding autogamy, herkogamy and dichogamy  <cit> . f. suspensa is also a widespread species with a large population size. all these features should result in a relatively high genetic diversity of f. suspensa. however, the species-wide level of genetic diversity  was unexpectedly lower than that of other seed plants in china based on the its, such as eriophyton wallichii   <cit> , achyranthes bidentata   <cit> , and primula obconica   <cit> . the species-wide level of cpdna-derived genetic diversity  was moderate compared with  <dig> other seed plants used as maternally inherited markers in china  <cit> . three possible factors contributed to the observed relatively low level of genetic diversity. first, the current climatically suitable areas predicted by the enm suggested that f. suspensa may have experienced habitat fragmentation, which was probably the key contributory factor resulted in the loss of genetic diversity. second, the low genetic diversity may be caused by increased human activity because this region had become a developed agricultural area since the neolithic period. third, as a main chinese traditional drug, over-harvesting of its fruit may have caused a sharp decline in the quantity of plants and may have also accelerated the loss of genetic diversity.

in addition, cpdna data demonstrated significant population differentiation within f. suspensa. population subdivision based on cpdna data  was much greater than the average level of other seed plants for maternally inherited markers   <cit> . another striking feature of f. suspensa was the marked group differentiation based on cpdna . significant ibd pattern was indicated by cpdna  analyses, suggesting that gene flow declined with increased geographical distance. generally, gene flow estimations using plastid dna markers are based on dna transmission through seeds in most angiosperm species  <cit> . however, f. suspensa lacks efficient seed dispersal mechanisms, and seeds of f. suspensa are small with wing-like structures. the seeds are dispersed by wind, the dispersal distance is short, and most seeds are spread in the same population, which may be one of the main reasons for the high levels of genetic differentiation. in addition, environmental conditions in mountains at higher elevations markedly differed from those in the intervening plains, which probably acted as barriers to gene flow through seeds and further resulted in high levels of interpopulation genetic divergence. however, due to lack of long distance dispersal mechanism for f. suspensa, the significant genetic differentiation among populations didn’t be caused by the ecological distance. meanwhile, considering the cultivated land area in low-elevation plains, the dblfs in the warm-temperate zone of china were fragmented, which led to patch-like habitats of f. suspensa.

in contrast to the significant phylogeographical structure obtained with cpdna, only a moderate level of genetic differentiation and phylogeographical structure was suggested by nrdna when examined over all populations . limited seed flow and high pollen flow among populations was considered to be the explanation for the nrdna-derived population differentiation in f. suspensa. in fact, the pollen-to-seed migration ratio  obtained for f. suspensa  was obviously higher than the corresponding average value reported for seed plant species   <cit> . the spatial pattern of maternally inherited cpdna differentiation has indicated the presence of obvious genetic structure; gene flow through long-distance dispersed pollen usually erodes the genetic signature of isolation by distance. thus, our results represented another example of this situation and provided evidence of efficient pollen-mediated gene flow among the isolated populations. considering the effects of such long-distance, pollen-mediated gene flow, forest fragmentation and habitat isolation among populations may not have played an important role in nuclear genomic diversification and speciation. however, analysis of isolation by geographical and ecological distance based on nrdna data indicated geographical or ecological factor was not related to pollen-mediated gene flow, which may be due to the mutual interference among different gene pools .

inference of phylogeographical history in f. suspensa
climatic changes during pleistocene glacial cycles are believed to have affected the present distribution pattern and phylogeographical structure of plant species  <cit> . however, the role of these climatic fluctuations in china’s warm-temperate zone and their potential importance in the current population genetic structuring of regional vegetation is not well understood. in order to investigate the effection by climatic changes during pleistocene glacial cycles, we selected f. suspensa as a model to test the three hypotheses which described in the introduction. in this work, the partitioning of genetic variability-based cpdna had a significant geographical component, each group had its own unique chlorotype, and no chlorotype was shared among groups. printzen et al., reported large-scale intraspecific disjunctions in many species that can alternatively be explained by range fragmentation and widespread long-distance dispersal  <cit> . given the lack of effective seed dispersal mechanism, widespread long-distance dispersal may not be the main reason for intraspecific disjunctions  <cit> . thus, the heterogeneous chlorotype composition and genetic structure may be ascribed to range fragmentation. fragmentation may be a consequence of isolation that can either be geographical or environmental. however, no obvious geographical barrier was found among the seven groups. therefore, f. suspensa did not appear to be geographically isolated, thereby allowing ecological niche modeling to be used in assessing species status. the model prediction for the current time indicated that f. suspensa may have experienced habitat fragmentation isolated by intervening unsuitable habitat. this phenomenon was particularly prominent between the shandong group and other groups . our divergence time analysis revealed that the divergence of the species most likely fell into the early-to-late pleistocene, about  <dig>  ma to  <dig>  ma, coinciding with frequent climatic oscillations during the pleistocene, which is considered as one of the most important periods for genetic diversification and speciation  <cit> . molecular clock analysis of chlorotype variation agreed with phylogenetic analyses in indicating the divergence of species long predating the lgm. thus, we presumed that the subdivision of the seven groups resulted from allopatric fragmentation in the past.

to further infer demographic processes, two markers were used to detect each group. the apparent population expansion  was found only in the shandong group, which was supported by the mismatch distribution, as well as tajima’s d and fu’s fs, values based on nrdna data , was also supported by ecological niche modeling . however, population expansion in the shandong group interestingly occurred not during warming stages but during glacial stages . although apparent population expansion was not detected in most groups by demographic analyses, we still presumed that the other six groups  experienced limited population expansion for high number of low-frequency private ribotype in most populations . similarly, these limited population expansion were also occurred during glacial stages, this opinion was also supported by enm . taken together, a scenario of repeated expanding to nearby low altitude plains in the glacial periods , and by retreating to mountaintops during interglacial warmer stages  is the most likely for f. suspensa during the quaternary climatic changes. however, population expansion did not result in continuous glacial distribution, and no geographical contact existed between groups. this suggestion was supported by the heterogeneous chlorotype composition of groups. unlike cpdna data, nrdna data supported populations were clustered into three groups, with each group including samples from two or more separate cpdna geographical groups . the discordance between the patterns revealed by cpdna and nrdna data indicated more extensive pollen-mediated gene flow than seed-mediated gene flow among the separate geographical groups.

by assuming f. suspensa agreed with the first hypothesis, we would expect to see a high diversity in southern populations and impoverished intrapopulation genetic diversity in the direction of recolonization  <cit> . however, our genetic analysis based on molecular dada did not support this view, i.e., the two southernmost populations p <dig> and p <dig> did not have a higher genetic diversity . ecological niche modeling also suggested f. suspensa was not compressed and underwent long southward migration during the lgm. under the scenario that the second hypothesis was appropriate for f. suspensa, present-day populations in the re-colonized area would probably show near genetic uniformity for derived chlorotypes and significant genetic diversity decline from refugia to the recolonized area. however, our data suggested that only the shandong group had uniform chlorotype, and the other groups  had heterogeneous chlorotype. in addition, no significant longitudinal or latitudinal gradient in nrdna diversity was observed in the three groups ; the other four groups were not calculated because only one population existed. based on analysis of isolation by ecological distance for cpdna , which further indicated no long distance dispersal occurred for this species. thus, most aspects of the herein characterized phylogeographical structure of f. suspensa agreed with the evolutionary model of interglacial compression and glacial-limited expansion. although f. suspensa obviously retreated at the northern edge, no evidence was found for the long-distance southward migration or large-scale range contraction during glaciation.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of molecular data and ecological niche modeling suggested that f. suspensa tracked quaternary climatic changes by expanding to nearby low-elevation plains in the glacial periods and by retreating to mountaintops during interglacial warmer stages, thereby experiencing fragmentation and isolation. no geographical contact zone existed among groups during the pleistocene glacial cycles, and extensive pollen-mediated gene flow weakened the genetic divergence among separate geographical groups.
