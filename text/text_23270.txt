BACKGROUND
nasopharyngeal carcinoma , whose onset can be found in the epithelial cells of the nasopharyngeal region, causes a high incidence of fatality in patients mostly in southern china and southeast asia  <cit> . epstein-barr virus , a ubiquitous human herpes virus, is thought to be closely associated with npc, as well as other hematopoietic malignancies such as african burkitt's lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma , hodgkin's disease, and adult t-cell leukemia. although infection by ebv occurs in most individuals, it is usually asymptomatic. ebv is orally transmitted and can be detected in oropharyngeal secretions from infected individuals  <cit> . subsequently ebv settles in resting b lymphocytes and renders infected b cells immortalized and unrestricted for proliferation  <cit> . some lines of evidence suggest that ebv enters b cells by pairing its glycoprotein gp350/ <dig> with the complement receptor   <cit> . once in the primarily infected host, this virus can establish a long and persistent latent infection during which only few viral genes are active, presumably to escape cellular defense. several viral proteins including ebna <dig>  lmp <dig> and lmp <dig> are active to maintain and regulate this latent state. the lytic production occurs after a long viral latency and can be triggered by spontaneous or artificially-induced reactivations, and eventually leads to the production of a large number of virions released through cell lysis. this is accompanied by the expression of certain lytic genes. z protein, encoded by viral bzlf <dig> gene, is a potent transactivator of multiple viral and cellular genes critical for switching from latent to lytic cycle. epithelial cells generally do not express cd <dig> in vivo and can be infected in vitro by direct contact with virus-containing cells or supernatant. this suggests that epithelial tissues might be infected by being close to lytically infected b cells. it remains to be shown that the transforming potential of ebv might ultimately contribute to the pathogenesis of npc.

currently, npc studies aim to achieve the following objectives: providing an early and sensitive diagnosis, and trying to understand the molecular basis underlying the disease formation  <cit> . the availability of the human genome sequence, a large collection of microarray expression data together with the development of bioinformatics will enable us to achieve these objectives. the gene expression omnibus   <cit>  has made available hundreds of thousands of experimental data of gene expression for users to explore. however, the interrelationship of many these data sets has not been explored. to identify genes associated with various cancers, techniques such as filtering by fold change, expression level or significance flag, as well as statistical analysis  have been applied to select candidate genes associated with tumorigenesis  <cit> . with these simple screening techniques for a given data set, one might end up with hundreds if not thousands of genes needed for further validation. recently, research exploring interactions and regulatory networks of selected genes and their products began to gain momentum in studying diseases  <cit> . many computational methods have been developed to facilitate expression data analysis. gene clustering, pathway analysis and gene ontology  analysis are commonly used  <cit> . moreover, literature mining enables us to extract the meaningful biological information from publications and to identify known networks or pathways  <cit> . the information, collected from human curation and comprehension of specific experiments, is very important in our analysis to further our understanding of the etiology of npc.

in this study, we have utilized a meta-analysis approach to identify meta-genes across different data sets. this is based on the belief that those significant genes shared by multiple data sets could be the ones which are more important to focus on. this allows us to turn our attention and resources to potentially high value targets as they are less likely to be derived from randomness of analysis. using such strategy, we have identified two sets of meta-genes  and discussed the potential roles some of them might play in the course of ebv-related neoplastic transformation.

RESULTS
screening strategy for meta-genes
to overcome the weakness of conventional microarray-based data analysis, meta-analysis was applied to heterogeneous microarray data of various origins  <cit> . we designed a strategy  to build up lists of meta-genes in ebv-positive tumors. this can be organized in two phases. in phase one, we first analyzed data sets derived from ebv primary infection and lytic production to identify meta-genes de-regulated by ebv when switching to lytic cycle. next, we extracted differential genes shared by two ebv+tumors  to find meta-genes commonly de-regulated by ebv. in phase two, gene clustering, pathway and network prediction were done in four steps:  meta-genes were classified based on known functional categories and similar ontological terms;  over-represented transcription factor binding sites  were predicted;  literature mining was conducted to analyze transcription factors that are co-cited with the meta-genes and , tissue specificity and subcellular localization of the meta-genes were analyzed. finally, we integrated all the above information into a gene interaction network and proposed our hypothesis.

differential genes
the venn diagram in figure 2a shows the distribution of differential genes between gse <dig>  and gse <dig> . in brief, of the  <dig> differentially up-regulated genes in gse <dig>   <dig> were also up-regulated and  <dig> others were found down-regulated in gse <dig>  of the  <dig> genes in the down-regulated group in gse <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in gse <dig>  a total of  <dig> differential genes were identified as likely targets by ebv during primary infection. many of these genes have been discussed  <cit> .

when cross-comparing these  <dig> differential genes expressed during ebv reactivation to the  <dig> differential genes found during primary infection,  <dig> meta-genes  were found to be the key candidates responsive to ebv.

the  <dig> differential genes in gse <dig>  and  <dig> genes in gse <dig>  were integrated in figure 2c. the intersection represents  <dig> overlapping meta-genes  expressed in both tumor types, including a group of  <dig> common genes ,  <dig> up-regulated in npc but down-regulated in pel, and  <dig> down-regulated in npc but up-regulated in pel. it is interesting to note that meta-a genes and meta-b genes, also referred to meta-genes collectively, share three genes in common: dek, dusp <dig> and itga <dig> 

functional analysis and gene annotation
 <dig> meta-a genes listed in table  <dig> are mainly involved in mapk signal cascade , macromolecule metabolism , phosphorylation , biopolymer metabolism , protein complex , cellular metabolism  and organ morphogenesis  based on david  analysis. the  <dig> meta-b genes in npc and pel are related to organelle lumen , cellular physiological process , macromolecule metabolism , ribonucleoprotein , regulation of cell process , cell adhesion  and transferase activity .

tfbss prediction
telis analysis  revealed that hlf- <dig>  atf- <dig>  mycmat- <dig>  e2f- <dig>  creb- <dig>  nfe2- <dig>  max- <dig>  creb- <dig>  tata- <dig> and oct- <dig> are over-represented within the proximal promoter region of many meta-a genes. we then looked for any common regulatory module by sifting through each of the promoter sequences. as a result, dusp <dig>  impdh <dig>  rps <dig>  top <dig>  pbpc <dig> and emp <dig> found in our study share these two tfbss: atf and creb.

the results of the genomatix bibliosphere analysis showed that dek, pitx <dig>  tgif <dig>  rb and junb encode for transcription factors/activators. transcription factor rb is known to bind e2f; tgif can complex with tale; junb associates with ap1f. moreover, rb was often co-cited with dek, cdkn1a and gadd45a  <cit> .

tissue specificity and subcellular localization
lymph node, one reservoir of resting b cells latently infected by ebv after primary infection, was chosen as a closely related tissue for npc because of the absence of nasopharyngeal epithelia data when studying tissue specificity. previous study has generated a list of tissue selective genes among which  <dig> are highly expressed in lymph node  <cit> . when comparing genes found in this study  with the  <dig> genes , no intersection was found.

analysis using genecards showed that most meta-genes and related transcription factors expressed predominantly in blood tissue. cd <dig>  itga <dig>  cdkn1a, tp <dig>  egr <dig> and st <dig> have been reported to be related to many tumor types including squamous epithelium tumor. in addition, most differential genes are localized either to nucleus or cytoplasm, except that cd <dig> and itga <dig> encode for membrane proteins. cdkn1a, rb, dek, daxx and map3k <dig> genes, which are downstream of the bzlf <dig> pathway, all reside on chromosome  <dig> 

regulatory network
 <dig> meta-a genes were used as input into pstiing to visualize any known functional associations, physical interactions or transcriptional regulations . there exist two main subnets: one contains appbp <dig>  cd <dig>  pitx <dig> and sp <dig>  the other one involves dusp <dig>  top <dig>  rps <dig> and pabpc <dig> 

literature mining using ihop was conducted to find support for the proposed networks. based on existing knowledge, a few more related transcription factors such as jun, myc, pgr and nfkb <dig> were added by genomatix bibliosphere to connect the  <dig> meta-a genes  or the  <dig> meta-b genes . as shown in figure 4b, most of the  <dig> meta-b genes cluster around cdkn1a, rb, jun, nfkb <dig>  tp <dig> and myc .

having integrated all the above information, we obtained a regulatory network of our meta-genes found to be related to npc .

discussion
four microarray data sets  were chosen to explore the molecular mechanism of ebv-dependent npc in our study. a few points can be drawn from this study as follows.  ebv seems to have a preference of targeting differentially expressed genes than those expressed ubiquitously in npc cells  <cit> . this suggests that infecting ebv triggers cellular changes by de-regulating many factors in signal transduction or regulatory pathways in order to remain in its host after primary infection.  nonetheless, only a fraction of these genes  stay differential during recurrent ebv reactivations and most other genes return to stable expression gradually. those remain differentially expressed  during recurrent reactivation worth more attention. they might be responsible for subsequent cellular transformation and possibly metastasis by spreading the virions through ebv's lytic proliferation and transforming more vulnerable host cells into npc.  the  <dig> meta-b genes shared by ebv-associated npc and pel would give important clue to understand the common pathogenesis of the ebv-led pathogenesis. the fact that both meta-a and meta-b gene sets share dek, dusp <dig> and itga <dig> in common indicates that all three cancer-related genes are more important to look at among all others.

* nine cell lines  derived from patients with lymphomatous effusions and three pel patient samples were used in gse <dig> 

with knowledge gathered by in-depth analysis, a detailed regulatory network was set up by joining newly identified meta-genes with related transcriptional factors. as shown in figure  <dig>  many of our meta-genes are involved in pathways rooted by lmp <dig> and bzlf <dig>  a transcriptional circuit involving sp <dig>  cd <dig>  egr <dig> and impdh <dig> connects three pathways led by lmp <dig> to the bzlf <dig> cascade through the inter-network between sp <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that e2f binding site can be found within the promoter region of sp <dig>  <cit> , and sp <dig> binding site can be found within the ebv early promoter  <cit> . this suggests that sp <dig> may be one of the key players in switching between the latent infection and lytic proliferation. the associations among meta-genes suggest that ebv latent infection probably depends on important regulators such as jun, myc, nf-κb, and p <dig> as previous thought  <cit> .

in latent infection, cdk <dig> activity is needed to maintain cell cycle progression and to phosphorylate rb. the pairing of rb/e2f as a complex plays important role in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, differentiation  <cit>  and ebv replication  <cit> . when rb gets hyperphosphorylated, e2f is released from the complex to transactivate its target genes needed for proliferation. in line with our prediction, expression of dek has been shown to be targeted and activated directly by e2f  <cit> . dek, an abundant and ubiquitous chromatin protein and transcription repressor  <cit> , can then regulate jun, myc, and p <dig> through daxx and map3k <dig>  for example, dek can inhibit apoptosis by interfering with p <dig>  <cit> . it has also been reported that rb-dependent over-expression of dek blocks senescence or apoptosis of infected cells  <cit> . cell death in response to dek knockdown was accompanied by increased protein stability and transcriptional activity of the p <dig> tumor suppressor  <cit> . when rb loses its activity, expression of both e2f and dek becomes up-regulated  <cit> .

bzlf <dig> and brlf <dig>  the switches from latency to lytic infection, are the drivers of the ebv lytic replication  <cit> . their expression are inactive in latent cells but can be activated by a number of triggers  <cit> . the activation depends on the existence of specific binding sites in their promoters, some of these binding sites can be bound by sp <dig>  creb, atf-1/ <dig> and c-jun  <cit> . we predicted that the forming of atf/creb heterodimers, also commonly found in hodgkin's disease  <cit> , may be important for regulating bzlf <dig> during recurrent reactivation. expression of the z protein, encoded by bzlf <dig>  is known to arrest cell cycle progression in several epithelial tumor cell lines lacking the entire ebv genome. such arrest is mediated by z-induced expression of p <dig> and two inhibitors of cdk, namely p <dig>  and p <dig> , followed by the accumulation of the underphosphorylated rb protein and the down-regulation of ebv immediate-early and early proteins  <cit> .

expression level of dek is much lower in reactivation state than in latent state. the lack of e2f released from the hypophosphorylated rb-e2f complex may have a causal effect on the down-regulation of dek and thus promotes apoptosis in the presence of apoptotic factors such as p <dig>  this suggests that dek may have been down-regulated in response to bzlf <dig> activation to favor the lytic cycle. comparing to latent cycle, the lytic cycle produces infectious virions up to  <dig> folds and possibly leads to the infection and transformation of more host cells. the accumulative effect of this could ultimately leads to aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. the potent lytic inducer bzlf <dig> has been explored to treat ebv+ tumors  <cit> . bzlf <dig>  if over-expressed exclusively in tumor cells using a tumor-specific vector , could induce potent cell lysis and serve as a general strategy to treat many cancers.

our meta-analysis approach re-analyzed four ebv-related tumor data sets and identified meta-genes using expression profiling and integrated bioinformatics. based on this information, we constructed a gene network to better our understanding of ebv-regulated neoplastic transformation. it should be pointed out that we have not specifically addressed the false discovery rate directly and thus our statistical analysis might have unavoidably produced some false positive hits or missed some important genes. however, gene set intersection can somehow prevent a large number of random genes from entering into our selection. like any other analytical approach, this process depends on data quality and completeness. it may not identify all the desirable inner networks if data is sub-optimal.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified two sets of meta-genes, including  <dig> meta-a genes expressed differentially when switching to recurrent reactivation, and  <dig> meta-b genes expressed in both ebv-dependent npc and pel. the integrated meta-gene network suggests that npc transformation is likely to depend on timely regulation of dek, cdk inhibitor, p <dig>  rb and several transcriptional cascades, interconnected by e2f, ap- <dig>  nf-κb, stat <dig> among others during ebv's life cycle. the result of this analysis demands for further investigation to validate and to justify. more data analyses are needed to support and to complement ours in order to explore thoroughly the molecular mechanism of npc. it is hope that research like this could point to the right direction for conquering this deadly disease eventually. in the meanwhile, the causal effect of ebv for npc remains for open discussion even though it is known for long that ebv is omnipresent in npc. future research should also pay attention to impacts of other factors as well since npc is quite restricted to some local populations and geographic locations. these factors include environmental, dietary ones in addition to ethnic genetic susceptibility and polymorphism.
