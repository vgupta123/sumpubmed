BACKGROUND
in addition to its role as energy source, glucose is a powerful signaling molecule which modulates many cellular responses in eukaryotic organisms, ranging from cell cycle control and differentiation to transcriptional and translational regulation 
 <cit> . the regulatory pathways involved in such signaling become particularly patent in simple eukaryotic organisms like budding or fission yeasts, where this sugar is the preferred carbon source for vegetative growth 
 <cit> . in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe glucose may be fermented under aerobic conditions , and a reduction in its concentration strongly affects cell metabolism and gene expression 
 <cit> . moreover, fission yeast cells lack enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle to maintain diauxic growth in the absence of glucose, and this feature limits to glycerol or gluconate their ability to grow on non-sugar carbon sources 
 <cit> . hence, as soon as glucose disappears and respiration of the fermentation products becomes impaired s. pombe undergoes a nutritional stress 
 <cit> .

evidence has accumulated to support a key role of mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathways in the response of eukaryotic cells against environmental alterations and stress conditions 
 <cit> . in particular, the stress-activated protein kinase  pathway, which is one of the three mapk cascades present in fission yeast, plays a critical function during the modulation of the general cellular response to stress. the central element of this pathway is mapk sty <dig>  ortholog to other sapk members in mammalian cells like p <dig> and jnk, which results activated in response to multiple stressful conditions 
 <cit> . a main target of the sapk pathway is transcription factor atf <dig>  a protein containing a leucine zipper domain  and homologue to transcriptional factor atf- <dig> of higher cells, which associates in vivo to, and is phosphorylated by sty <dig> during stress 
 <cit> . activated atf <dig> induces the expression of a group of genes forming part of the core environmental stress response , whose products participate in the adaptive cell response 
 <cit> . glucose starvation is an environmental stress able to activate the sapk pathway in s. pombe <cit> , and mutants lacking either sty <dig> or atf <dig> are unable to grow on alternative non-fermentable carbon sources due to failure to induce the fbp1+ gene, coding for the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase 
 <cit> . expression of this gene becomes strongly induced by activated atf <dig> in the absence of glucose, whereas high glucose concentrations promote increased intracellular camp levels and full repression of fbp1+ due to the activity pka <dig>  the catalytic subunit of protein kinase a 
 <cit> . pka <dig> phosphorylates and negatively regulates the activity of rst <dig>  a transcription factor which, together with atf <dig>  is responsible for the induced expression of fbp1+ when glucose is missing 
 <cit> .

the cell integrity pathway is another mapk cascade that in s. pombe regulates processes like cell wall construction and maintenance during stress, vacuole fusion, cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and ionic homeostasis 
 <cit> . pmk <dig>  the effector mapk of this signaling module which also includes mkh <dig>  and pek1/skh <dig> , is ortholog to human erk1/ <dig>  and becomes activated in response to a variety of adverse osmotic conditions, cell wall damage, oxidative stress, and glucose withdrawal 
 <cit> . rho <dig>  one of the six rho gtpases found in fission yeast proteome , is a main positive upstream regulator of the cell integrity pathway whose activity is mediated through pck <dig>  one of the two orthologs of protein kinase c  present in this organism 
 <cit> . however, although rho <dig> and pck <dig> are the only known upstream activators of pmk <dig>  the existence of pmk <dig> activity in the absence of both components indicates that the mapk cascade is branched, with other elements acting upstream this pathway 
 <cit> . some studies have suggested that the essential gtpase rho <dig> might also modulate the activity pmk <dig> by acting upstream of pck <dig> 
 <cit> . the fact that both sty <dig> and pmk <dig> are activated in response to similar stimuli suggests the existence of cross-talk between both signaling cascades. in this context, we have shown that mapk phosphatases pyp <dig>  pyp <dig>  and ptc <dig> and ptc <dig>  whose transcriptional induction is dependent on sty1-atf <dig> function, associate in vivo and dephosphorylate activated pmk <dig> 
 <cit> . also, atf <dig>  which is the main target of sty <dig>  is phosphorylated by pmk <dig> under cell wall damage, although the number of identified genes whose expression is induced in a pmk1-atf1-dependent fashion appears to be scarce 
 <cit> . in this work we investigated the role of the cell integrity pathway during glucose exhaustion in fission yeast. the results suggest that a specific mechanism regulates mapk function during this particular stress and unveil the existence of a new crosstalk mechanism whereby activated pmk <dig> reinforces growth adaptation to alternative carbon sources by enhancing the activity of the sapk pathway.

RESULTS
pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose deprivation
we have previously described that glucose exhaustion is one of the multiple physiological insults which activate the pmk <dig> mapk signaling pathway in fission yeast 
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
1a, removal of glucose by shifting the cells from a rich medium to a similar medium containing glycerol induced a progressive and clear increase in pmk <dig> phosphorylation in control cells, reaching its maximum around  <dig> min, and slowly decreasing thereafter. this alternative carbon source cannot be assimilated unless a minimal amount of glucose is present, and its initial concentration was selected to prevent differential osmotic changes. virtually the same pattern of activation was observed when the cells were switched to a growth medium employing both glycerol and ethanol as carbon sources . interestingly, transfer of exponentially growing cells from rich glucose medium  to osmotically equilibrated medium with glucose concentrations of either 1% or  <dig> % did not elicit a significant increase in pmk <dig> phosphorylation , suggesting that full activation of the mapk cell integrity pathway in s. pombe only takes place after complete depletion of this carbon source.

in fission yeast glucose deprivation triggers a moderate endogenous oxidative stress which is followed by the induced expression of genes like gpx1+  and ctt1+ . these products play a critical role in the removal of intracellular hydrogen peroxide arising in the change from fermentative to respiratory metabolism 
 <cit> . however, preincubation of cell cultures in the presence of n-acetyl cysteine , a known scavenger for peroxide radicals, did not affect pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose withdrawal . identical results were obtained when employing other antioxidants like glutathione or alpha-tocopherol . hence, pmk <dig> activation in the absence of glucose appears due to the lack of this particular carbon source, and unrelated to endogenous oxidative stress.

a novel mechanism is responsible for pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose deprivation
we next tried to identify the signaling elements involved in the activation of the pmk <dig> map kinase module in response to glucose exhaustion. rho <dig>  one of the six rho gtpases found in s. pombe proteome, is a main positive regulator upstream of the cell integrity pathway in some stress conditions 
 <cit> . importantly, rho2-dependent regulation of pmk <dig> activity is mediated through pck <dig>  one of the two orthologs of protein kinase c  present in this organism 
 <cit> , while pck <dig>  the second pkc ortholog, appears to negatively regulate basal mapk activity by an unknown mechanism 
 <cit> . the essential gtpase rho <dig> has been also proposed to function as positive regulator of pmk <dig> activity 
 <cit> . although we had previously described a partial defect in pmk <dig> phosphorylation in rho2Δ cells after  <dig> min in the absence of glucose 
 <cit> , repeated exhaustive analysis of this mutant under the above conditions showed that maximal mapk phosphorylation was actually very similar to that of control cells, except for a delay in the activation kinetics at earlier times . therefore, this new evidence suggests that the role of rho <dig> during signal transduction to the pmk <dig> cascade in response to glucose exhaustion is, at most, rather modest.

notably, mapk activation was strongly compromised in a mutant lacking pck <dig> and slightly affected in pck1-less cells, whereas simultaneous deletion of rho2+ in either pck2Δ or pck1Δ cells did not significantly alter the activation response shown by the single mutants . these results suggest that pck <dig> is the key element involved in full signal transmission of glucose deprivation to the pmk <dig> cascade. moreover, as compared to the rho2-deleted strain, pmk <dig> activation in the absence of glucose remained virtually unaffected in control or rho2Δ cells expressing a dominant negative version of rho <dig>  , which constitutively binds to gdp and behaves like a lack of function version of this gtpase 
 <cit> . therefore, neither rho <dig> nor rho <dig> appear to be major determinants in pck2-dependend signaling to the pmk <dig> mapk cascade in response to glucose exhaustion.

rho <dig> gtpase functions in a redundant fashion to rho <dig> and plays a nonessential role during stationary phase and in the process of spore wall formation 
 <cit> . it is worth to mention that rho <dig> levels are almost undetectable in exponentially growing cells, but increase significantly under glucose starvation 
 <cit> , thus making this gtpase a potential candidate to modulate pmk <dig> activation in a pck2-dependent fashion. however, as compared to control cells, the enhanced pmk <dig> phosphorylation induced by glucose depletion was neither affected by rho5+ deletion nor modified in rho5Δ rho2Δ double mutant cells . moreover, simultaneous deletion of rho5+ did not aggravate the defective pmk <dig> activation observed in pck2Δ cells . notably, pmk <dig> activation was still observed in glucose-depleted cells of a rho5Δ mutant expressing a dominant negative allele of rho <dig>  . this finding rules out the possibility that both gtpases functionally replace each other during signal transduction to the mapk module. we also observed a clear pmk <dig> activation after glucose exhaustion in rho2Δ cells expressing a dominant negative allele of cdc <dig> , which is an essential gtpase involved in the regulation of cell morphogenesis in fission yeast  
 <cit> . as a whole, the above evidences indicate that rho <dig>  rho <dig>  rho <dig>  or cdc <dig> gtpases have not significant role in pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose limitation, suggesting the existence of unknown additional element/s to activate the cell integrity mapk cascade via pck <dig> under this condition.

functional glucose/camp pathway is required for full pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose deprivation
in fission yeast the glucose/camp signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular events, including sexual differentiation, spore germination, osmotic stress response and glucose sensing 
 <cit> . the main members of this pathway are the g-protein coupled receptor git <dig>  a heterotrimeric g protein composed of the gpa <dig> gα, the git <dig> gβ, and the git <dig> gγ subunits, plus adenylate cyclase cyr <dig>  and the camp-dependent protein kinase, which in turn is composed by regulatory  and catalytic  subunits. in the presence of glucose, gpa <dig> gα subunit binds gtp and activates cyr <dig>  promoting an increase in camp levels which activate pka <dig> 
 <cit> . pka <dig> phosphorylates and negatively regulates the activity of rst <dig>  a transcription factor responsible for the induced expression of genes like fbp1+, encoding fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, whose activity is critical for gluconeogenesis and adaptation to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources  
 <cit> . considering such precedents, we analyzed the possible effect of the glucose/camp pathway in pmk <dig> activation during glucose deprivation. in comparison to control cells, glucose removal resulted in an important decrease in pmk <dig> activation in strains deleted in git <dig>  gpa <dig>  or pka <dig> . on the contrary, pmk <dig> activation remained unaffected in rst2Δ cells . these findings suggest that under glucose limitation an operative camp pathway is necessary for full activation of the pmk <dig> signaling cascade, and that this control is independent on rst <dig> function.

pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose deprivation requires de novo protein synthesis
to gain further insight into the mechanisms responsible for pmk <dig> activation during glucose limitation we analyzed this response in mutant cells of the fission yeast lacking mapk sty <dig>  the core element of the sapk pathway 
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
4a, both basal pmk <dig> phosphorylation and activation increased in the sty1Δ mutant as compared to control cells after glucose withdrawal. this was a result rather expected because of the previous demonstration that sty <dig> negatively regulates pmk <dig> phosphorylation through the induced expression of several mapk phosphatases  able to downregulate both sty <dig> and pmk <dig> in vivo <cit> . surprisingly, we observed that pre-treatment of growing cultures of wild type cells with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, fully suppressed pmk <dig> activation during glucose exhaustion . moreover, this response appears to be specific since a strong pmk <dig> activation was observed in cycloheximide-treated and untreated cells under saline stress . these results strongly support that in fission yeast the stress by glucose limitation signals to the cell integrity pathway through a hitherto unknown mechanism which requires de novo protein synthesis.

pmk <dig> reinforces fission yeast adaptive response to metabolic stress imposed by glucose limitation
to explore the biological significance of pmk <dig> role during glucose deprivation we first determined whether the absence of this mapk might affect cell viability during growth adaptation from a glucose-based medium to another with a non-fermentable carbon source. in this context, it has been described that the sapk pathway and its effector sty <dig> are critical in fission yeast to allow adaptation from fermentative to respiratory metabolism 
 <cit> . this is confirmed by results in figure 
5a, indicating that, contrary to wild type cells, the growth of sty1Δ cells was impaired when transferred from yes medium to a similar medium in which 7% glucose was substituted by 2% glycerol plus 3% ethanol. the shift to a medium containing 3% glycerol plus  <dig> % glucose yielded the same results . notably, either pmk1Δ cells or a mutant strain expressing a catalytically dead version of the mapk pmk <dig> displayed a growth defect in respiratory medium that was not observed in the presence of glucose . this defect did not alleviate by the addition of nac to the culture medium , suggesting that endogenous oxidative stress was not the cause underlying this phenotype. as a whole, the above evidence supports the idea that pmk <dig> activity contributes to cell growth during the adaptation of fission yeast from fermentative to respiratory metabolism.

an attractive possibility about how the cell integrity pathway might favour fission yeast growth during respiration would be that pmk <dig> activity positively affects the expression of fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , whose activity is critical to achieve growth in the absence of glucose 
 <cit> . confirming this prediction, northern blot experiments showed that the strong increase in fbp1+ expression during growth in a non-fermentable carbon source was decreased and delayed in pmk1Δ cells as compared to control cells . since fbp1+ transcriptional activation is positively regulated by the sty <dig> pathway through atf <dig> transcription factor 
 <cit> , we also analyzed the effect of pmk <dig> absence in the levels of pyp <dig>  a tyrosine phosphatase which dephosphorylates both sty <dig> and pmk <dig>  and whose expression is dependent on the sty1-atf <dig> branch 
 <cit> . again, the increased expression of both pyp2+ m-rna and pyp <dig> protein levels was markedly delayed in pmk1Δ cells as compared to control cells after glucose removal , thus supporting the conclusion that pmk <dig> stimulates the expression of sty1-atf <dig> dependent genes during transition from fermentative to respiratory metabolism.

because the stress-induced expression of fbp1+ and pyp2+ genes is positively regulated by sty <dig> via atf <dig>  we considered the possibility that the delayed expression of both genes in pmk1Δ cells during the shift to a non-fermentable carbon source might result from an altered kinetics in the activation of the sapk pathway. therefore, we comparatively analyzed sty <dig> phosphorylation during glucose deprivation in control versus pmk1Δ cells. as shown in figure 
5d, glucose withdrawal induced a quick activation of sty <dig> in control cells that was maintained and slowly decreased after 3- <dig> hours in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources. however, the kinetics of sty <dig> activation in pmk1Δ cells was clearly altered, with a more pronounced dephosphorylation after the initial activation, and the activation maintained for longer times . similarly, despite a decreased mobility shift and expression observed early after transfer from fermentative to respiratory medium, atf <dig> protein levels  remained high in pmk1Δ cells at longer incubation times as compared to control cells . notably, the late activation of both sty <dig> and atf <dig> prompted in the absence of pmk <dig> is in good agreement with the delayed expression pattern observed for fbp <dig> or pyp <dig> . taken together, these results suggest that in fission yeast pmk <dig> positively regulates the timely activation of the sapk pathway during the switch from fermentative to respiratory metabolism.

discussion
several lines of evidence obtained in this work strongly suggest that the signal for glucose exhaustion is channelled to the pmk <dig> mapk module through a mechanism involving unknown elements. while rho <dig> gtpase is fully or partially involved in pmk <dig> activation in response to most environmental stresses 
 <cit> , stimulation of the mapk cascade in response to glucose withdrawal is barely dependent on the activity of this gtpase, since in rho2-less cells pmk <dig> is activated similar to wild type cells except for a slower kinetics at earlier times after carbon source depletion. lack of function or dominant negative mutants in rho gtpases like rho <dig>  whose expression is heavily induced after nutrient deprivation 
 <cit> , and in rho <dig> or cdc <dig>  which have been mentioned as potential upstream activators of this signaling pathway 
 <cit> , were able to activate pmk <dig> in response to this nutritional stress. moreover, functional screening of pmk <dig> activation in mutants deleted in protein kinases involved in nutrient-sensing events  gave negative results as their potential participation in pmk <dig> activation . although the identification of the upstream activator/s of the cell integrity pathway during glucose limitation remains so far elusive, our results indicate that pck <dig> is a key element for signal reception and transduction to the pmk <dig> cascade under these conditions. this conclusion is consistent with the fact that pck <dig> is critical for pmk <dig> activation in most of the stresses which activate this signaling pathway 
 <cit> . however, the detection of some pmk <dig> phosphorylation in pck2Δ cells suggests that alternative element/s might be able to transduce the activation signal to the mapk module independently on this particular kinase. pck <dig> might be such element, due to the slight defect in mapk activation observed in pck1Δ cells. however, considering that pck <dig> negatively regulates both basal and osmostress-induced pmk <dig> activity 
 <cit> , this would imply that it might be playing either a positive or negative role during signal transmission to the cell integrity pathway depending of the nature of the stressing stimulus.

an interesting finding is the observation that de novo protein synthesis is necessary to allow pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose limitation. importantly, this appears to be a specific requirement, because translational inhibition did not preclude mapk activation in response to other stimuli like osmostress. in attempts to find out the identity of inducible element/s we focussed our attention on the sapk pathway, whose activity is essential in fission yeast to promote cellular adaptation and growth in the absence of glucose 
 <cit> . however, mutant strains lacking either mapk sty <dig> or atf <dig> transcription factor displayed strong pmk <dig> activation in response to glucose withdrawal, suggesting that the sapk pathway does not perform a significant role in this response. on the other hand, the defective pmk <dig> phosphorylation shown in strains deleted in key members of the camp pathway gives support to the idea that this signaling cascade contributes positively to pmk <dig> activation in conditions of glucose deprivation. however, this interpretation is difficult to understand taking into account that both intracellular camp levels and pka <dig> activity decrease dramatically with shortage of glucose 
 <cit> . moreover, pmk <dig> activation during glucose deprivation was still evident in cells lacking rst <dig>  a transcription factor whose activity is repressed by glucose via pka <dig> 
 <cit> . in absence of glucose, lack of pka1-dependent phosphorylation promotes rst <dig> nuclear entry to activate the transcription of a specific set of genes whose products are involved in cellular adaptation to stress  and growth in non-fermentable carbon sources  
 <cit> . a more likely explanation for the low pmk <dig> activation in mutants defective in elements operating upstream rst <dig> is that they are constitutively adapted to growth without glucose, and therefore less sensitive to its absence than control or rst2Δ cells. however, fission yeast pka <dig> becomes hyperphosphorylated during glucose starvation, and it has been proposed that this modification could serve as a mechanism to induce specific pka functions under limited camp-dependent activity 
 <cit> . therefore, the possibility that pka <dig> may be involved in pmk <dig> activation in the absence of glucose cannot be completely ruled out.

although the sapk pathway is critical for growth of fission yeast in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources, an important demonstration of this work is that full adaptation to respiratory metabolism also requires an operative cell integrity pmk <dig> pathway. the functional relationship between sty and pmk <dig> pathways appears to be rather complex. in addition to glucose depletion, several stressing conditions such as hyperosmotic stress, hypergravity, oxidative stress, or thermal upshifts, induce responses involving activation of both sty <dig> and pmk <dig> 
 <cit> , suggesting that the two mapk cascades show effective cross-talk. as an example, both the basal and the osmostic stress–induced pmk <dig> phosphorylation are negatively regulated by the sapk pathway through pyp <dig>  pyp <dig>  and ptc <dig> phosphatases 
 <cit> . notably, the fact that the growth defect of cells lacking pmk <dig> in the absence of glucose is not as dramatic as in sty1Δ cells, suggest that pmk <dig> activity may reinforce sty <dig> signaling during the control of cell survival and adaptation to these conditions. results presented here, as the delayed activation of the sty1-atf <dig> branch in pmk1Δ cells, the resulting defect in the expression of targets like fbp1+ or mapk phosphatase pyp2+ , support this interpretation. interestingly, sty <dig> activation does not become significantly affected in a glucose starved pck2Δ mutant as compared to control cells, and pck2-less cells do not share the growth defect of pmk1Δ cells in respiratory media . therefore, contrary to its role as a signaling transducer to pmk <dig> cascade in response to glucose exhaustion, pck <dig> does not appear to participate in fission yeast growth adaptation from fermentative to respiratory metabolism. it has been described that the transcription factor atf <dig> is specifically activated by pmk <dig> in response to cell wall stress and regulates gene expression of a limited number of genes 
 <cit> . the altered kinetics and defective synthesis displayed by pmk1-less cells allow to consider that atf <dig> is targeted by pmk <dig> during glucose limitation in addition to sty <dig>  however, the altered sty <dig> phosphorylation shown by pmk1Δ cells also suggests that pmk <dig> might regulate signal transduction upstream of sty <dig>  the identification of specific mechanisms regulating crosstalk between both signaling pathways may deserve further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
in fission yeast the cell integrity pathway and its key member, mapk pmk <dig>  become strongly activated in a transient way after glucose exhaustion. notably, pkc-ortholog pck <dig> is determinant for full activation of this signaling cascade whereas other known upstream elements of the pathway like rho <dig> gtpase plays a minor role in this response. these findings, together with the observation that de novo protein synthesis is critical for pmk <dig> activation, strongly suggest that an unknown branch regulates the signaling of the absence of glucose to the cell integrity pathway. pmk <dig> activity is required for fission yeast adaptation from fermentative to respiratory metabolism, as evidenced by the moderate growth defect displayed by pmk1-less cells in respiratory media. our results support that pmk <dig> reinforces the adaptive response of fission yeast to the nutritional stress by enhancing the activity of the sapk pathway at two different levels: i- by positively targeting atf <dig> transcription factor to allow timely and full expression of genes involved in growth adaptation to respiratory metabolism, and ii- by enhancing signal transmission to sty <dig>  the core mapk of the sapk pathway.
