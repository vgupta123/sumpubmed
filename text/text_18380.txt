BACKGROUND
soybean is a major source of oil and protein in the human diet and in animal feed. however, as soybean is deficient in sulfur-containing amino acids , its nutritional value is limited. the n/s ratio of soybean seed is considered an indicator of protein quality. marsolais et al.  <cit>  reported that major seed storage proteins deficiency was associated with a nearly two-fold increase in sulfur-containing amino acid content in genetically related lines of common bean. accordingly, increasing the content of sulfur-containing amino acids in seed proteins is a target of soybean breeding. sulfur deficiency in soil is one reason for the decreased synthesis of sulfur-containing storage proteins  <cit> , and the ability of soils to retain and release sulfur to crops is reduced with increases in planting density. this situation has led to a growing input of high-analysis low-sulfur-containing fertilizers and has globally resulted in widespread areas of sulfur deficiency  <cit> . in china, sulfur deficiency in soil has been reported in south china, northeast china, shandong province, and shanxi province  <cit> . for these reasons, the mining and characterization of genes that could genetically alter sulfate assimilation and utilization efficiency is an important approach for increasing the amount of sulfur-containing amino acids in soybean seeds.

plants carry out inorganic sulfate assimilation, which involves complicated reduction and assimilatory reactions, by utilizing organic sulfur compounds, such as sulfur-containing amino acids, co-enzymes with iron-sulfur centers, thiamine, lipoic acid, coenzyme a, many secondary metabolites . the first step in the assimilatory process is the uptake of sulfate from the environment by a plant proton/sulfate co-transporter in the plasma membrane of root cells. various sulfate transporters with different affinities, capacities and cell type-specific localizations are encoded by a family of genes, and these transporters are responsible for both the absorption of sulfate and its accumulation within cells .

sulfate transporters  are encoded by a large gene family, comprising  <dig> genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> in wheat,  <dig> in rice and  <dig> in populus stremula × p. alba , that can be subdivided into four groups with divergent functions  <cit> . group  <dig> sultrs are high-affinity transporters, group  <dig> low-affinity transporters, and group  <dig> vacuolar sulfate exporters. group  <dig> sultrs are the most diverse, encoding transporters of plastid membranes and symbiosome membranes as well as others with specific or unknown functions  <cit> . all known sulfate transporters have  <dig> membrane-spanning domains  and a sulfate transporter anti-sigma  domain at their carboxy-terminus  <cit> . the stas domain of atsultr1; <dig> has been reported to facilitate localization of the transporter at the plasma membrane and to influence the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain  <cit> ; the stas domain is also involved in regulating the activity of o-acetyl-serine  lyase   <cit> .

the sultr family has been well characterized in arabidopsis. the high-affinity transporters atsultr1; <dig> and atsultr1; <dig> co-localize in the root and are responsible for the uptake of sulfate from the soil  <cit> ; atsultr1; <dig> is localized in the phloem and is involved in the source-to-sink transport of sulfate  <cit> . low-affinity sulfate transporters atsultr2; <dig> and atsultr2; <dig> mediate the translocation of internal sulfate within plants and are involved in regulating vascular sulfate transport  <cit> ; in addition, atsultr2; <dig> is a target gene of mir <dig>  <cit> . atsultr3; <dig> is co-expressed with atsultr2; <dig> and enhances root-to-shoot sulfate transport activity  <cit> . lastly, atsultr4; <dig> and atsultr4; <dig> localize to the tonoplasts and mediate the efflux of sulfate from the vacuolar space into the cytoplasm  <cit> .

expression of sulfate transporters can be affected by the sulfur status of the plant. in poplar, responses to early sulfur deficiency include increases in the expression of ptasultr1; <dig> and mirna <dig>  <cit> , with long-term deficiency enhancing the expression of ptasultr1; <dig> and ptasultr4; <dig>  <cit> . other responses involve taesultr1; <dig>  taesultr2; <dig>  and taesultr4; <dig> expression in wheat  <cit>  and atsultr2; <dig> expression in xylem parenchyma and pericycle cells in arabidopsis roots  <cit> .

to date, there have been some studies about sulfate transporters in soybean rhizobia. gmn <dig> transcripts appeared in the root just before nodule emergence  <cit> ; the gmn <dig> sequence  is part of that of gmsultr2; <dig> . additionally, clarke et al.  <cit>  confirmed the involvement of soybean sulfate transporters in rhizobia symbiosis. moreover, sst <dig> transports sulfate from the plant cell cytoplasm to intracellular rhizobia in the model legume lotus japonicus  <cit> .

although sultr genes have been characterized in other plants, there are few reporters about soybean sulfate transporters. in this work, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the soybean sultr gene family using phylogenetic and expression analyses. furthermore, we isolated soybean gmsultr1;2b and characterized the function in soybean tissues, yeast cells and transgenic tobacco plants. we also attempted to explain the mechanism by which gmsultr1;2b transports sulfate in transgenic tobacco plants using microarray analysis. this work presents an examination of the sultr gene family at the genomic level, and the results will provide a basis for further investigation of the functions of soybean sultr genes.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic and expression analyses of sultr genes
twelve arabidopsis sultrs were used as query sequences for blastn searches of the soybean database in phytozome  with default parameters; redundant sequences were manually discarded. twenty-eight putative sultr genes, located on  <dig> chromosomes, were identified in the soybean genome . their proteins all contain stas domain in the c-terminal region, which is critical for sulfate transporter activity and stability. to gain insight into the biological functions of these genes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a full-length amino acid alignment of the sultrs , including  <dig> putative soybean sultr sequences,  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana sultr sequences,  <dig> oryza sativa sultr sequences, and  <dig> populus tremula × p. alba sultr sequences. following takahashi et al.  <cit> , the  <dig> putative soybean sultr proteins were classified into  <dig> groups based on phylogenetic analysis:  <dig> sequences in group  <dig>   <dig> in group  <dig>   <dig> in group  <dig>  and  <dig> in group  <dig> . therefore, the putative soybean sultr genes are likely to share similar functions with other members of the same subfamily. these soybean genes were named corresponding to homologous genes from other species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of predicted sulfate transporter amino acid sequences from soybean. a phylogenetic tree was generated using putative amino acid sequences with mega  <dig> and the neighbor-joining method. bootstrap values support percentages from  <dig> replicate trees. the scale bar indicates  <dig>  substitutions per site in the amino acid sequence. the putative protein sequence accession numbers are provided in additional file 1: table s2



based on in silico expression analysis, the  <dig> putative sultr genes exhibit different tissue expression patterns . many of the soybean sultr transcripts were abundant in the root, stem, and seedling. to validate the reliability of the expression profiles obtained from in silico expression analysis, we conducted rt-pcr for a subset of  <dig> genes from  <dig> groups . as shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  expression of most of the genes was the same across the two platforms. among the soybean sultr genes, gmsultr1;2b  was primarily expressed in the root ; thus, we further cloned and analyzed this gene.fig.  <dig> expression profiling of  <dig> putative soybean sultr genes.  expression profiling of  <dig> putative soybean sultr genes in different tissues using semi-quantitative rt-pcr.  expression profiling of  <dig> putative soybean sultr genes at different days after flowering using semi-quantitative rt-pcr



gmsultr1;2b is specifically expressed in roots and is induced by sulfur deficiency
the genomic sequence of gmsultr1;2b, located on chromosome  <dig>  is 4759 bp and contains  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. the gmsultr1;2b orf is 1980 bp and encodes a 659-amino acid polypeptide, with a calculated protein molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a predicted pi of  <dig> . the gmsultr1;2b protein contains sultr conserved domains  and  <dig> predicted msds in the n-terminal region . a conserved motif   <cit>  with a significant number of polar residues is located between msd  <dig> and msd  <dig>  gmsultr1;2b is 95 % identical to gmsultr1;2a. gmsultr1;2b is also highly homologous to other plant high-affinity sulfate transporter proteins , which are specifically expressed in the root and induced by sulfur deficiency, sharing 89 % identity with stsultr <dig> , 90 % with stsultr <dig> , 87 % with bjsultr1;2b  and 83 % with atsultr1; <dig> .

the expression positions of gmsultr1;2b were localized using onion epidermal cells as a transient expression system. the coding region of gmsultr1;2b fused with gfp was controlled by the camv 35s promoter. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the gmsultr1;2b–gfp fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane of onion epidermal cells, whereas the control  was distributed throughout the entire cell.

the expression levels of gmsultr1;2b in response to sulfur deprivation were analyzed by quantitative real time pcr  analysis. as shown in fig 3a, expression was clearly up-regulated under sulfur deprivation conditions and increased with a decrease in the sulfate level in the soybean root. the expression level of gmsultr1;2b under sulfate deficient conditions  was 7-fold higher than that under sulfate sufficient conditions . however, expression levels were unchanged in the soybean shoot and leaf. these results suggest that gmsultr1;2b expression in the root is mediated by the sulfur status of the culture medium.fig.  <dig>

to further confirm root expression of gmsultr1;2b, a 2259 bp fragment  upstream of the gmsultr1;2b translation start site  was amplified and fused to gus. the construct was transformed into soybean hairy roots via agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation, and hairy roots carrying pgmsultr1;2b::gus were stained for gus activity. the gus activity of pgmsultr1;2b::gus was higher under -s conditions compared to +s conditions , consistent with the expression patterns revealed by qrt-pcr . therefore, the gmsultr1;2b promoter can drive gus expression in the root and is induced by low-sulfur stress.

the gmsultr1;2b protein exhibits sulfate transport activity
to evaluate the sulfate transport activity of gmsultr1;2b, we performed a complementation analysis using the cp154-7a yeast mutant strain, which is unable to grow on medium containing low concentrations of sulfate as the sole sulfur source because it carries two defective sulfate transporter genes . this mutant yeast strain was transformed with gmsultr1;2b, atsultr1; <dig> , or the p112a1ne empty expression vector  and grown for 3 days on yeast nitrogen base  medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate or  <dig>  mm homocysteine as the sole sulfur source. mutant cells expressing yp112-gmsultr1;2b, yp112-atsultr1; <dig> or the empty vector all grew well with  <dig>  mm homocysteine, but only the cells expressing yp112-gmsultr1;2b or yp112-atsultr1; <dig> grew well on medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate as the sole sulfur source . these results suggest that the protein encoded by gmsultr1;2b is able to complement yeast cells defective in sulfate transport.fig.  <dig> functional expression of gmsultr1;2b in yeast.  ynb solid culture medium containing  <dig>  mm homocysteine.  ynb solid culture medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate.  the position of each yeast strain on the plates.  growth curves generated from a 24 h culture grown in ynb liquid culture medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate.  effects of culture medium ph on the growth of the three yeast strains grown in ynb liquid culture medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate.  uptake of 35s-labeled sulfate by yp112-gmsultr1;2b yeast cells. sulfate uptake rates were calculated after transferring the cells to media containing different external sulfate concentrations at ph  <dig> . error bars represent the standard deviation. cp154-7a, cp154-7a mutant strain transformed with the empty vector ; yp112-atsultr1; <dig>  cp154-7a transformed with yp112-atsultr1; <dig> ; yp112-gmsultr1;2b, cp154-7a transformed with yp112-gmsultr1;2b




although cells harboring the three constructs could grow in ynb medium containing  <dig>  mm sodium sulfate, the mutant cells expressing yp112-gmsultr1;2b or yp112-atsultr1; <dig> grew much better than those expressing the empty vector , and the mutants expressing yp112-gmsultr1;2b or yp112-atsultr1; <dig> grew much better at ph  <dig> to  <dig> than at ph  <dig> to  <dig> . indeed, the growth rates of both strains decreased markedly when the ph was increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  thus, the optimum ph for the mutant cells with yp112-gmsultr1;2b or yp112-atsultr1; <dig> is slightly acidic, at ph  <dig>  cells carrying yp112-atsultr1; <dig> grew notably better than those carrying yp112-gmsultr1;2b at ph  <dig> to  <dig>  though the growth rate of the two strains was similar at ph values of  <dig> and  <dig>  these results indicate that the sulfate transporters have different proton  dependence or that a change in affinity occurs at different external ph values. to determine the kinetic properties of the gmsultr1;2b transporter, sulfate uptake rates in complemented cp154-7a yeast cells were measured and found to be between  <dig> and 90 s after suspending the cells in 35s labeled medium. these data indicate that sulfate uptake mediated by the gmsultr1;2b transporter follows michaelis-menten kinetics, with a km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm .

gmsultr1;2b confers tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants under sulfur deficiency stress
to gain further insight into the function of gmsultr1;2b, a construct containing the gmsultr1;2b orf driven by 35s promoter was transferred into tobacco plants; after pcr analysis  and southern blotting of all transformed plants, three independent lines, namely, s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  with one copy of the gmsultr1;2b gene, were selected for further study . we found that the t2gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants grew better than the control plants . moreover, the seed weights of lines of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were significantly improved, with the average increasing by 11 % . these findings indicate that gmsultr1;2b overexpression could enhance seed yield.fig.  <dig> phenotype of gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants.  the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing s <dig> line plant grown under normal conditions in soil is shown on the left and the control plant  on the right.  the s <dig> line plant is shown on the left and the ck plant on the right.  the s <dig> line plant is shown on the left and the ck plant on the right

to obtain additional details, 2 month-old tobacco plants of lines s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were examined with regard to biomass and the content of sulfur-containing compounds. under +s conditions, the tobacco plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b accumulated more biomass compared to the control plants , with an average increase of 13 %, showing that the former maintained better growth and development. additionally, the soluble protein content  and total thiol content  of leaves were enhanced in the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants compared to the control plants, with average increases of  <dig> and 83 %. among total thiols, the cys content  of leaves was enhanced. these findings indicate that overexpression of gmsultr1;2b could enhance the content of organic matter, especially organic sulfur including sulfur-containing amino acids. in addition, the total sulfur content of whole plants  was increased in the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants compared to the control plants. in contrast, the total carbon  and nitrogen  contents of the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants were not significantly changed compared to the control plants . the so42− content of roots was also increased significantly, by an average of 23 % . these results indicate that overexpression of gmsultr1;2b enhanced the sulfur absorption capacity of the plants.table  <dig> contents of c, n, and s in gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants and control plants

under -s conditions, the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants showed chlorosis but not as severe as the controls, whereas the control plants displayed severe chlorosis symptoms after 2 weeks of growth . under sulfur deficiency stress, the tobacco plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b accumulated more biomass compared to the control plants, on average more than 18 % . the chlorophyll content of the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants was significantly higher than that of the control tobacco plants , though there were no significantly differences between the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing and control plants under +s conditions . moreover, under the -s condition, the soluble protein and total thiol contents of the leaves were also an average of  <dig> and 107 % greater in the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants compared to the control plants , as was the so42− content of the roots  . the so42− content of the roots in the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants was not significantly changed under the -s condition compared to under the +s condition, whereas a substantial reduction in the control plants was observed . in addition, the differences under the -s condition were more obvious than under the +s condition, with the biomass and soluble protein and total thiol contents of the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants decreasing less than those of the control plants under the –s condition compared to that under the +s condition. these findings indicated that under -s conditions, acclimation by the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants was much better than that of the control plants. all these results indicate that overexpression of gmsultr1;2b enhanced plant yield under +s conditions, reduced plant production loss under -s conditions, and improved plant tolerance to sulfur deficiency stress.fig.  <dig> phenotype of gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants under +s and -s conditions.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under +s conditions  for 2 weeks.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under +s conditions for 2 weeks.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under +s conditions for 2 weeks.  control plants grown under +s conditions for 2 weeks.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under -s conditions  for 2 weeks.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under -s conditions for 2 weeks.  plants of the line s <dig> grown under -s conditions for 2 weeks.  control plants grown under -s conditions for 2 weeks

many studies have shown that sulfur-containing compounds are associated with stress. to address whether an increased total thiol content could enhance stress tolerance, we also subjected gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants and control plants to drought stress  and salt stress  . under drought stress, it showed that the fresh weight of gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco seedlings were average 132 % more than that of control seedlings , the root length of gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco seedlings were average 15 % longer than that of control seedlings , and the number of lateral root of gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco seedlings were average 67 % more than that of control seedlings . however, under salt stress, there were no significant difference in fresh weight, root length and the number of lateral root between gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco seedlings and control seedlings . these results indicated that the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco seedlings showed better tolerance to drought stress than the control plants, though no significant difference under salt stress was observed.fig.  <dig>

gmsultr1;2b overexpression results in changes in the transcripts of genes related to metabolism and transporters in tobacco plants
we compared mrna levels in the leaves of control and gmsultr <dig> b-overexpressing tobacco plants grown in soil. a total of  <dig> probe sets exhibited at least a 2-fold change in expression in the leaves of the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. among these differentially expressed genes,  <dig> probe sets annotations were found in ncbi and tigr , and  <dig> probe sets were assessed by qrt-pcr, confirming the reliability of the microarray results . on the basis of gene annotations and gene ontology, these  <dig> probe sets were classified into  <dig> functional categories, including biosynthesis and metabolism-related proteins, cell wall-related proteins, stress-related proteins, transporters, redox-related proteins, transcription factors, photosynthesis-related proteins, and developmental process-related proteins . among them, the largest group of regulated transcripts in the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants was categorized as biosynthesis-and metabolism-related proteins. this group of transcripts included  <dig> related transcripts, among which the level of s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase  was reduced. among  <dig> genes related to transporters, the transcript levels of the nramp <dig> metal transporter, opt <dig> oligopeptide transporter, mitochondrial phosphate transporter, potassium transporter, nitrite transporter, sugar transporter, and sultr3; <dig> were up-regulated .fig.  <dig> overview of the microarray results for tobacco leaves showing ≥  <dig> -fold differences in expression. the number of genes in one of the  <dig> identified functional categories: cytoskeleton-related proteins; transcription factors; biosynthesis and metabolism-related proteins; cell wall-related proteins; plant defense response-related protein; stress-related proteins; development process-related proteins; redox-related proteins; hormone-related proteins; transporters; photosynthesis-related proteins; and unclassified functional proteins on the basis of gene ontology  and gene annotations

altogether, overexpression of gmsultr1;2b result in the genes categorized as biosynthesis- and metabolism-related proteins, transporters, photosynthesis-related proteins, and developmental process-related proteins were regulated. these genes may be the reason that overexpressing gmsultr1;2b could enhance tobacco plant yield under +s conditions, reduce tobacco plant production loss under -s conditions.

discussion
soybean is an ancient tetraploid, and the number of predicted coding genes in soybean is nearly twice that in arabidopsis  <cit> . due to genome duplications that occurred approximately  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, nearly 75 % of soybean genes are present in multiple copies  <cit> . therefore, single-copy genes in arabidopsis are generally represented by multiple copies in soybean. accordingly, the number of sulfate transporter genes in soybean is more than the number of such genes in arabidopsis. indeed, there are  <dig> sulfate transporter genes in soybean but only  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in oryza and  <dig> in populus tremula × p. alba. most of the sulfate transporter genes in soybean exist as  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> copies , among which gmsultr1;2a and gmsultr1;2b are present as  <dig> copies. however, further research is required to determine the relative contribution of the  <dig> soybean sulfate transporter genes to overall sulfate transport and whether all copies are involved in sulfate acquisition, translocation and remobilization. in this study, we focused on gmsultr1;2b.

gmsultr1;2b is a functional sulfate transporter and can be regulated by the sulfur status
sulfate uptake into cells and efflux from cellular vacuoles is facilitated by multiple sulfate transporters, which in plants are h+/sulfate cotransporters depending on the proton motive force  <cit> . the mutant yeast strain cp154-7a is defective for sul <dig> and sul <dig> genes and cannot transport sulfate under conditions of low sulfate availability  <cit> . thus, the function of exogenous sulfate transporter genes can be demonstrated through complementation of this defect, and transport activity can be monitored using this yeast expression system . in the present study, cp154-7a harboring the gmsultr1;2b cdna was able to grow on ynb medium containing low concentrations of sulfate as the sole sulfur source, suggesting that gmsultr1;2b encodes a functional sulfate transporter that can transport sulfate across the plasma membrane. the apparent uptake affinity of the high-affinity sulfate uptake system in plants operating at low sulfate concentrations has a km value that ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm, whereas the low-affinity system operating at high sulfate concentrations has a km value ranging from  <dig> to 1200 μm  <cit> . our kinetic analysis of the gmsultr1;2b transporter revealed a km of  <dig>  μm, with a high affinity for sulfate . furthermore, the mutant strain expressing gmsultr1;2b grew better at ph  <dig> to  <dig> than at ph  <dig> or  <dig>  altogether, we suggest that gmsultr1;2b is a h+-dependent high-affinity transporter.

in plants, members of the sulfate transporter gene family are specifically expressed in different tissues and in response to reduced sulfur availability as well as other environmental conditions, and the protein products carry out different functions  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atsultr1; <dig> is localized to the root epidermis and cortex and is suggested to be the key root sulfate transporter facilitating the uptake of sulfate from the soil  <cit> . atsultr1; <dig> expression is induced by s deficiency, mainly regulated by metabolic demand, and controlled by photoperiod  <cit> . in soybean, the  <dig> putative soybean sulfate transporter genes show tissue-specific expression patterns. of these genes, gmsultr1;2b shares 83 % identity with atsultr1; <dig> and is specifically expressed in roots. our results also demonstrate that expression of gmsultr1;2b is induced by s deficiency, with expression that fluctuates in an alternating manner . the growth curve of cp154-7a yeast cells expressing the gmsultr1;2b cdna was similar to that of cp154-7a expressing atsultr1; <dig> cdna . taken together, we suggest that soybean gmsultr1;2b might have functions similar to those of arabidopsis atsultr1; <dig>  i.e., in mediating the uptake of sulfate from the soil into plant roots.

gmsultr1;2b alters the sulfur status of overexpressing tobacco plants
soil sulfur deficiency is a widespread limiting factor in crop production  <cit> , and sulfur addition to the soil or foliar application is required to maintain or increase yield. overall, an appropriate sulfur supply may help to maintain efficient photosynthesis and metabolism, enhance defense reactions and protein quality, and increase biomass production during periods of sulfur deficiency . genetic manipulation of sulfate transporters can improve sulfur utilization efficiency  <cit> , and one advantage of improving the sulfate transporter system of plants would be to reduce the need to add sulfur fertilizer because these plants would be able to take up sulfur more efficiently and/or would possess the ability to reduce the loss of available sulfur from the soil. to date, soybean has remained one of the difficult crops to transform; indeed, compared to other crops, such as rice and corn, the transformation frequency of soybean is rather low  <cit> . thus, it is very difficult for public research groups to transform genes into soybean, and researchers typically transform soybean genes into a model plant, such as tobacco or arabidopsis for heterologous expression. accordingly, we analyzed the function of gmsultr1;2b through heterologous expression in tobacco plants and found that gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants exhibited better growth and higher accumulation of biomass than the control plants. in addition, chlorosis in the control plants was more serious than in the plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b under conditions of sulfur deficiency, and the chlorophyll content increased compared to control plants under -s conditions. these results indicate that the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants were able to take up sulfur more efficiently. thus, gmsultr1;2b overexpression can improve the sulfur utilization efficiency and alter the sulfur status of transgenic plants.

c, n and s assimilation pathways constitute the most important pathways of plant primary metabolism, interacting in the synthesis of cys and other important reduced sulfur-containing compounds, such as met and gsh  <cit> . c and n assimilation provides carbon skeletons and reduced nitrogen for the synthesis of amino acids and proteins, and s and n assimilation pathways are well coordinated and influence each other. indeed, sulfur deficiency decreases nitrate uptake and the activity of nitrate reductase  <cit> , and correspondingly, nitrogen deficiency reduces the activities of sulfate-assimilation enzymes and the transcript levels of relevant sulfate-assimilation genes  <cit> . in our study, gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing tobacco plants showed enhanced accumulation of protein and sulfur-containing amino acids in leaves and an increase s content in aboveground parts. however, the total n and c contents were the same as those of control plants, suggesting that the concentrations of protein c and n increased while nonprotein c and n decreased.

possible mechanism by which gmsultr1;2b alters the sulfur status in overexpressing tobacco plants
due to the limitations of gene chip analysis, not every gene changes have been detected. moreover, the tobacco genome sequencing results have not been published. our gene annotation information was not complete. but we still have some useful findings. in our study, many genes related to transporters, such as nramp and opt, were found to be regulated in tobacco plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b. atnramp <dig> and atnramp <dig> influence metal accumulation , are involved different processes, including resistance to bacterial pathogens, support early development, and are required for optimal photosynthesis and growth . opt <dig> can rescue copper-deficient and manganese-deficient yeast mutants and plays a critical role in the maintenance of whole-plant iron homeostasis and iron nutrition in developing arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . these findings suggest that gmsultr1;2b may regulate other types of transporters to accumulate more nutrition, resulting in enhanced biomass and seed weight in tobacco plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b.

sahh catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine to l-homocysteine and adenosine and is important for cell growth and regulating gene expression  <cit> . complete inactivation of sahh activity in plants is embryonic lethal  <cit> , and partial inactivation results in developmental malformations  <cit> . however, there are potential beneficial outcomes of the controlled down-regulation of sahh, including the suppression of viral replication and enhancement of drought stress tolerance  <cit> . in addition, down-regulation of sahh <dig> expression in yeast leads to both sah accumulation and impacts on cellular lipid homeostasis  <cit> . in our study, the level of sahh transcript was reduced in tobacco plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b compared to control tobacco plants. this result suggests that down-regulation of the sahh gene may be a reason why the gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing plants accumulated more sulfur-containing compounds  than the control plants. in addition, the plants overexpressing gmsultr1;2b exhibited enhanced drought stress tolerance. it has been reported that the application of sulfur fertilizer improves drought tolerance in plants  <cit> , and it is possible that plants may down-regulate sahh in response to gmsultr1;2b overexpression not only to accumulate more sulfur-containing compounds but also to enhance growth and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we confirmed gmsultr1;2b as a functional sulfate transporter that plays an important role in sulfate uptake and could alter the sulfur status of plants. we found that overexpression gmsultr1;2b in tobacco plants could enhance yield under +s conditions, reduce production loss under -s conditions, and improve tolerance to sulfur deficiency stress. the mechanism by which increased biomass and seed yield in gmsultr1;2b-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants occurs could be due to greater nutrient uptake and transport capabilities as well as enhanced development and accumulation of organic matter, as indicated by microarray analysis.
