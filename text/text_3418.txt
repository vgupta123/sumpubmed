BACKGROUND
as one of the most important cereal grains, rice has been used as a major food source for more than half of the world’s population  <cit> . asian cultivated rice is divided into two subspecies, oryza sativa ssp. japonica and oryza sativa ssp. indica. the japonica varieties are adapted to more temperate climates, whereas most indica varieties are generally adapted to tropical lowland cultivation  <cit> . the distinction between the two rice subspecies has been recognized in china since at least the han dynasty  <cit> .

however, the origin of the two subspecies has long been under scrutiny and debate, particularly on whether the two subspecies were derived from a single or multiple domestications  <cit> . numerous studies have suggested that the two subspecies of indica and japonica were probably independently domesticated from different isolates of the wild rice, oryza rufipogon  <cit> , which was then followed by further differentiation  <cit> . londo et al. believed that indica might have originated from a region south of the himalaya mountain range, whereas japonica originated from wild rice in southern china  <cit> . on the other hand, molina et al. reported that asian rice might have been domesticated from a single origin  <cit> . a more recent study supports the viewpoint of a single origin, indicating that asian rice cultivars might have been domesticated from southern china  <cit> . the comprehensive and deeper survey of the genetic basis of domestication may contribute to improved domestication strategies of organisms and provide novel approaches in deciphering the process of domestication . to date, the debate on the origin of asian rice cultivars remains elusive, thus requiring additional evidence to resolve this issue.

ongoing works have already characterized a large number of genes, such as sub1a  <cit> , s- <dig>  <cit> , and nrt <dig> b  <cit> , which were demonstrated to be involved in differentiation between the two subspecies. similarly, some other genes are related to domestication from wild to cultivated rice, including bh <dig>  <cit> , prog <dig>  <cit>  and sh <dig>  <cit> . it is essential to utilize these genes in distinguishing the two subspecies or wild rice from rice cultivars. however, information on the mechanism underlying the differences in morphological, physiological, and biochemical features, as well as some other aspects between the two subspecies or wild rice and cultivated rice is limited. moreover, the agronomic traits may be controlled by multiple genes, which were difficult to be identified  <cit> . therefore, additional studies that aim to identify genes that are involved in the domestication of rice at the whole-genome scale using new methods such as whole genome sequencing technology are warranted  <cit> .

recently, a batch of  <dig>  rice accessions have been fully sequenced with high coverage  <cit> , which provided unprecedented opportunities to explore the differentiation between indica and japonica via genomic approaches. by characterizing the two types of domesticated regions according to selection signatures and subsequent phylogenetic analysis, we delimited the potential zone for origins of the two subspecies, that is, the two subspecies may have a common origin in the indo-china peninsula. in addition, significant positive selection and particular genes that possibly control important morphological traits between cultivars and wild rice, as well as differentiation between indica and japonica were identified in these two types of domesticated regions, which suggests that selective sweep with significant positive selection may serve as the driving force for the differentiation of the two rice subspecies.

RESULTS
selection of the rice accessions
although the  <dig>  rice genomes dataset  <cit>  provides an unprecedented resource for detecting the selective sweep regions in rice cultivars, most of which have low-coverage or inadequate sequencing depths that are difficult to employ in the high-resolution detection analysis due to the frequent coverage gaps. therefore,  <dig> cultivars with ≥15× sequencing depths were downloaded from the  <dig>  samples . to detect the regions with significant differentiation between japonica and indica, only those cultivars with significant differentiation that was detected by diversity calculation and pca were retained . finally,  <dig> out of the  <dig> rice cultivars, including  <dig> indica and  <dig> japonica cultivars, from  <dig> different countries , were used for further analysis, which have  <dig> × average sequencing depth . the other  <dig> cultivars were removed due to the potential genetic admixtures of these two subspecies . and the retained cultivars exhibited scattered geographic distribution. about 1/ <dig> of these cultivars were collected from china and india, both of which are geographically larger. another 1/ <dig> were from countries in southeast asia, including thailand, burma, cambodia and so on. the last 1/ <dig> were from other countries, such as japan, south korea and so on.

in addition, the sequences of  <dig> diverse wild rice o. rufipogon or o. nivara  accessions, which were believed to be the immediate progenitor of the asian cultivated rice of o. sativa, were collected from previous reports  <cit>  . these sequences have 11× sequencing depth on average . on the other hand, the whole-genome sequences of  <dig> african rice o. glaberrima accessions, which are closely related to o. sativa and o. rufipogon, were downloaded at a  <dig> × average sequencing depth  as outgroups for further analysis.

nucleotide diversity/divergence within or between these two subspecies
after trimming and removing low-quality bases, the clean reads of  <dig> asian cultivated rice,  <dig> wild rice, and  <dig> africa cultivated rice accessions were mapped to the nipponbare reference genome. then, joint snp calling and genotyping of the sequenced samples were performed . after stringent filtering, a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps across all the  <dig> various rice samples were called and used to estimate diversity among samples or divergence among groups.

based on the snp data, π was estimated at  <dig>  within japonica and  <dig>  within indica groups , which were higher than that within japonica  and indica  that were estimated in  <dig> chinese indica and japonica landraces  <cit> . these discrepancies may be due to  higher genetic diversity in the worldwide cultivars than that only in chinese landraces;  an underestimation of the genetic diversity in these  <dig> chinese landraces caused by the low-coverage sequencing depth . d
xy between indica and japonica was about  <dig>  in our selected samples , suggesting a significant differentiation between these two subspecies, which also had been confirmed by the pca analysis. as expected, the diversity within these wild rice accessions was about  <dig>  , which was significantly higher than that in japonica or indica, suggesting the strong bottleneck during the domestication that has also been reported by other studies  <cit> . as is known, the short-read sequencing technology could generate massive erroneous snp calls if not properly handled. however, it was less likely for those false signals to mimic the truly differentiated snps. such erroneous calls would distribute more randomly, both in japonica and in indica, which rarely resulted in low diversities within each subspecies. furthermore, we did not observe any inflation in the estimated diversities, or any significant departure in the pca analysis. this implies a conservative snp call set, given the high coverage dataset and the stringent criteria used in this study.

detection of regions that underwent selective sweep
the large snp data set detected in our samples provides an opportunity to identify artificial selected regions by comparing polymorphism levels in these cultivated and wild rice accessions. the selective signature from domestication with selective sweep includes a reduction in nucleotide diversity/divergence and altered allele frequency in these domestication loci. as mentioned above, the average diversity within japonica or indica is about  <dig> . therefore, the value of  <dig>  was employed as one cutoff to detect the divergent regions between japonica and indica. among these divergent regions, only those which have at least 10-fold lower diversity  between the two subspecies can be defined as selective sweep regions both in japonica and indica. compared with previous studies, two advantages can be found in our definition: i) the ten-fold-lower diversity is a more stringent criterion than previous study  <cit> ; ii) by using  <dig> , we can easily exclude these regions having very low divergence between these two subspecies and very low diversity within each of the two subspecies, which may not be the result of divergence and selection, instead, caused by sequencing or analytical errors.

therefore, two types of domesticated regions were detected : domesticated region type i , which have undergone selective sweep within each subspecies  but have high divergence between these two subspecies ; domesticated region type ii , which have low diversity regions shared by both subspecies , but have high diversity within the wild rice  .table  <dig> blocks with selective sweep

dr-i, domesticated regions of type i that have undergone selective sweep within each subspecies  but have high divergence between these two subspecies ; dr-ii, domesticated regions of type ii that have low diversity shared by both subspecies , but have high diversity within the wild rice

dr-i showed that differentiation has already occurred in these wild rice, and selective sweep was independently imposed on the domestication of indica or japonica, respectively. therefore, the indica-japonica differentiation was driven not only by genetic drifts or possible natural selection of wild rice, but also by artificial selection of cultivated rice. the artificial selection should be much more powerful in accelerating the differentiation progress. for this type of domesticated regions, a total of  <dig> blocks, including about 890 kb of dna  and  <dig> genes, were detected . meanwhile, since japonica had been subdivided into temperate japonica and tropical japonica  <cit> , π within temperate japonica and tropical japonica, and d
xy between temperate japonica and indica and tropical japonica and indica were calculated . all the data showed a similar result, suggesting that the dr-i regions were conserved in temperate japonica and tropical japonica, and divergent between temperate japonica and indica or tropical japonica and indica.

for dr-ii, normal diversity was detected within these wild rice accessions , whereas very low diversity was detected not only within each subspecies , but also between the two subspecies , suggesting that selective sweep was simultaneously imposed on both indica and japonica, and these overlapping dr-iis may have originated only once or as a result of selection and subsequent introgression from one subspecies to another. for this type of domesticated region, a total of  <dig> blocks, including about 640 kb genomic length , was detected .

origin of dr-i
when using the snps of dr-i to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, as expected, all japonica or indica samples clustered together within its own clade, respectively, whereas the japonica clade was distantly located from the indica clade , which was consistent with the results of pca analysis that the japonica varieties clearly segregate from the indica individuals . furthermore, tajima’s d and fst statistics also indicated significant differences of the genetic structure between japonica and indica populations in the dr-i region . on the other hand, some wild rice accessions were clustered within the japonica or indica clade, respectively, and some wild rice accessions were scattered outside the two cultivated rice clades, which was also consistent with the findings of previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> dr-i blocks. the low depth wild rice  were not used in this tree

in these  <dig> dr-i blocks, the average diversity was  <dig>   within japonica and  <dig>   within indica . however, the average divergence between these two groups was  <dig> , which was 11- to 101-fold higher  than the diversity within each group , suggesting significant differentiation between indica and japonica in these regions. the average diversity is ~15-fold lower within japonica and ~16-fold lower within indica than their corresponding genome-wide diversity, suggesting strong selection with selective sweep on these regions. on the other hand, in these blocks, significantly positive correlations were displayed either in the diversity within indica vs. japonica, or d
ind-jap vs. πjap or πind, or d
jap-wild and d
ind-wild . this was consistent with the possibility that japonica and indica may have undergone strong artificial selection from different isolates of the wild rice o. rufipogon during domestication at least in these domesticated blocks.

for this reason, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using snps of the  <dig> dr-is to determine which wild rice was more similar to the  <dig> domesticated blocks that were fixed or near fixed in japonica or indica, respectively. similar to the findings of previous studies  <cit> , four clear clades were detected, including the african rice clade , japonica clade with some o. rufipogon accessions, indica clade with some o. rufipogon accessions, and an independent o. rufipogon clade . all japonica or indica samples were clustered together, whereas all japonica samples were far from all of these indica samples, which matched the pca result that the japonica varieties clearly segregated from the other groups, suggesting that, at least in these  <dig> dr-i regions, these two subspecies were probably independently domesticated from different wild rice isolates. interestingly, the wild rice accessions with the highest similarity to japonica varieties were w <dig>  w <dig>  p <dig> and w <dig> , which were collected from thailand to southern china, suggesting that these japonica domesticated regions may have independently originated from the regions of southern china  <cit>  to the indo-china peninsula. on the other hand, the wild rice accessions with the highest similarity to indica were w <dig>  ca <dig>  l89_ <dig> and irgc <dig>  all of which were collected from indo-china peninsula, suggesting that these indica domesticated regions may have independently originated from the regions of indo-china peninsula. therefore, the indo-china peninsula might be the overlapping place with the closest wild relatives both for japonica and indica.

due to limited sampling size of wild rice, one possible explanation for the topology of the phylogenetic tree was that the dr-is are retained by frequent introgression from cultivars to some wild rice. to test this hypothesis, more wild rice samples are necessary for further investigation of the origin of these domesticated regions. we expect if most other wild rice accessions have a similar pattern with above regions, then we can exclude the introgression from cultivars to wild rice in these two regions. conversely if there were a variety of wild rice accessions exhibiting dissimilar pattern in these two regions, then introgression from cultivars to wild rice may have an impact in our selected wild rice samples. then, more than  <dig> whole-genome sequenced wild rice samples were collected to enlarge the sample panel, mostly having low sequence depth  . additional file 1: table s <dig> repeatedly shows that the wild rice accessions from the indo-china peninsula  or southern china  have the highest identity to the genotype of japonica, whereas most of the wild rice accessions from the indo-china peninsula  have the highest identity to the genotype of indica. this is consistent with the above result that, at least in these  <dig> dr-i regions, the closest wild relatives for japonica and indica have the overlapping place in indo-china peninsula, suggesting that both of the two domesticated subspecies may have a common place of the origin.

origin of dr-ii
in the  <dig> dr-ii blocks, the average diversity was ~ <dig>  either within japonica or indica, even in all of these cultivars, which was about 21-fold  lower than that of wild rice accessions , suggesting strong selective sweep both in indica and japonica accessions. this result also suggested that these  <dig> dr-ii blocks should have a common origin and subsequently introgressed from one subspecies to another  <cit> . the diversity in these regions within japonica, indica, or both was significantly lower than the diversity in the  <dig> dr-i blocks within japonica  or indica , suggesting that the dr-i blocks may be independently fixed in indica or japonica prior to the fixation of the dr-ii blocks.

a phylogenetic tree was also reconstructed using the snps from the  <dig> dr-ii blocks. as expected, all japonica and indica samples were clustered together as a cultivar clade , which was different from the topology of the dr-is, in that tree japonica samples were distantly located from these indica samples and in different clades. the wild rice with the highest similarity to japonica and indica in this tree was also the wild rice of w <dig>  which had the highest similarity only to indica but not japonica samples in dr-is, suggesting that these  <dig> dr-ii blocks might have introgressed from indica to japonica.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> dr-ii regions




to further investigate the direction of introgression in these dr-iis, more whole-genome sequenced wild rice samples, including those with low depth, were used as earlier described. the wild rice accessions of w <dig> , w <dig> , w <dig> , ca97_ <dig> , and w <dig>   have the highest identity to dr-iis in both indica and japonica. on the other hand, all these wild rice accessions were clustered within the indica-type wild rice clade in the phylogenetic tree. this result further suggested that the  <dig> dr-iis were introgressed from indica to japonica, which was contradictory to the reported  <dig> major domestication sweeps introgressed from japonica to indica  <cit> , suggesting that not only introgression from japonica to indica, but also from indica to japonica could be detected in our rice cultivars.

functional classification and selection pressure of specific genes
in the dr-i and dr-ii regions,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were detected, respectively . to determine the functional categories of these genes, we summarized the possible functions of these genes using rice gene ontology  annotation  .

most of the genes in the dr-i regions have a significant functional enrichment in cell growth, anatomical structure morphogenesis, cellular component organization, dna metabolic process, reproduction, embryo development, and photosynthesis ; for example, some functions responding to seed or coleoptile development , flower, pollen, or anther development , root development  . this functional enrichment analysis was consistent with the findings of previous reports that the differentiation of morphological and physiological traits was an adaptation to distinct climatic, ecogeographic, and cultural conditions between indica and japonica .

because the selective sweep was respectively detected in indica and japonica, and significant differentiation between these two subspecies was observed, we expected that more genes under positive selection would be detected in the genes of dr-i during the differentiation of indica and japonica. therefore, the ka/ks between indica and japonica samples was employed to evaluate positive selection of these genes. interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes  with ka/ks > <dig>  were detected , which showed a significantly higher proportion  than that  of the genome-wide reports  <cit> , suggesting that a large number of the dr-i genes were under positive selection during the differentiation of indica and japonica, and the differentiation of the two subspecies was driven by both artificial and natural selection with strong positive selection, which directly acted on many characteristics.

genes in the dr-ii regions were enriched in cell differentiation, anatomical structure morphogenesis, cell growth, photosynthesis, awns development, flower development, cell cycle, embryo development, and reproduction . this functional enrichment was consistent with the reports on the differentiation of morphological and physiological traits for cultivars and wild rice. for example, sh4
 <dig>  a gene related to shattering, which was included in the selective sweep regions in the research of huang et al.  <cit> , was also found in our dr-ii. remarkably, a more recent research reported a highly conserved region in chromosome  <dig>  which was also included in our dr-ii regions  <cit> . laba <dig>  and gad <dig>  were also detected in our results, which were associated with long, barbed awns in wild rice   <cit> .

discussion
there is currently an ongoing debate both in the genetic and archaeological arenas on the origins of asian cultivated rice  <cit> . numerous studies have suggested that indica and japonica may have multiple origins and that the two subspecies might have been independently domesticated from different isolates of the wild rice of o. rufipogon  <cit> , and indica might have originated in eastern india and japonica from southern china  <cit> . however, a recent report has shown that a single origin for domesticated asia rice was more likely to have occurred than multiple origins, as indicated by the results of bayesian phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . interestingly, a more recent study based on genome-wide variation has reported that japonica might have been first domesticated from wild rice of or-iii in southern china, and was subsequently followed by dispersal to southeast asia, and then crossed with local wild rice of or-i to generate indica after several cross-differentiation-selection cycles  <cit> . another model was recently proposed by choi et al., in support of separate origins for different rice subspecies, but only a single de novo domestication of rice which occurred in japonica.  <cit> . other studies have shown that the domestication process of rice might have been initiated multiple times, followed by extensive introgression of strongly selected alleles, e.g., some important domesticated genes of sh <dig>  rc, and waxy, which originated in japonica and spread to indica  <cit> . therefore, frequent introgression between indica and japonica is a widely accepted theory for the domestication of rice  <cit> . however, the geographical discordance relating to the concept that japonica was domesticated in southern china, and indica was generated in southeast asia or south asia by japonica crossing with local wild rice after its dispersal remains elusive.

interestingly, our data have shown that japonica and indica may have a common place of the origin in indo-china peninsula in the dr-i and dr-ii, which have the highest identity to that of the wild rice from indo-china peninsula and south asia, suggesting that all these regions with strongly selective sweep may have a common place with the highest identity for some accessions of the wild rice. this result was consistent with those of a recently published study  <cit> . on the other hand, our data also showed that the average diversity in the dr-ii regions either within japonica, indica, or both was significantly lower than that in the dr-i blocks within japonica  or indica  , suggesting that the dr-i blocks were independently fixed in indica or japonica prior to the fixation of these dr-ii blocks. third, our data also showed that all of the  <dig> dr-iis were introgressed from indica to japonica, which was inconsistent with the findings of previous reports in that  <dig> major domestication sweeps might have introgressed from japonica to indica  <cit> , suggesting that not only introgression from japonica to indica but also from indica to japonica can be detected in the rice cultivars.

therefore, a possible model of the origin of the cultivated rice  may be that  the proto-indica and proto-japonica might have independently originated from the divergent wild rice in the indo-china peninsula, in which the dr-is with significant divergence between the two subspecies may have been domesticated during this period;  then, followed by frequent introgression from indica into proto-japonica also in the indo-china peninsula , or from japonica into proto-indica in southern china  <cit> , modern japonica and indica formed and spread to different regions. during this period, dr-iis may have been domesticated in all these cultivated rice .fig.  <dig> the model of the origin of the cultivar rice japonica and indica. in this model, the modern japonica and indica were domesticated from different wild rice

rice have undergone a series of similar phenotypic domestication for effective harvest and planting from their wild progenitors, including a reduction in seed shattering and dormancy, synchronization of seed maturation, increase in seed sizes, and decrease in culm number and branches . on the other hand, the two major rice subspecies are differentiated by a number of morphological and physiological characters, along with a substantial sterility barrier  <cit> . therefore, we expected that the genes with strongly selective sweep should have functional bias.

interestingly, for the genes found in dr-i regions, on one hand, a significant functional bias was detected in seed or coleoptile development, flower, pollen or anther development, and root development , which was consistent with the differentiation of the morphological and physiological traits, e.g., seed size, between the two subspecies. on the other hand, a large number of these domesticated genes were detected to have undergone positive selection, suggesting that the differentiation of the two subspecies was driven by both natural and artificial selection with strong positive selection in these domesticated genes.

furthermore, some genes under strong positive selection had a tendency of being clustered within small regions. for instance, a  <dig> -mb block containing  <dig> dr-is showed a significantly lower diversity in japonica than indica, which strongly implied selection sweep and genetic bottleneck . within this block,  <dig> genes , which may be related to root development and coleoptile development, were clustered . in addition, not only these  <dig> genes, but also the nearby genes were under a significantly positive selection , although the function of the other genes was unclear or apparently showed no relationship with the differentiation of japonica and indica. hitchhiking effect may explain such a high positive selection of this region, or that the genes with unknown functions may have played major roles in the differentiation of the two rice subspecies. similar results were observed in dr-ii , suggesting that these regions may contain a large number of important genes that were related to the domestication of the cultivated rice. coincidentally, two clustered regions in chr04:  <dig>  mb– <dig>  mb and chr08: <dig>  mb- <dig>  mb were also detected by hua et al.  <cit>  and jin et al.  <cit> . thus, the present research not only determined the origin of the asian rice cultivars in higher detail, but also facilitated in the discovery of more genes relative to domestication and breeding. our method could be applied to molecular breeding and agricultural schemes of various rice cultivars.

we need to notice that, although the samples were only selected according to the coverage threshold, we could not totally rule out sampling bias. in this study, we only focused on those most highly-differentiated indica and japonica accessions, this could be failed to reflect the truly diversity between indica and japonica. the somewhat controversial conclusions from different researches  <cit>  might in turn reflect the importance of sampling strategy. however, as we are not going to draw a final conclusion on the debate of rice domestication, we called for more extensive samplings to further test the generalizability of our conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
by using  <dig> whole-genome sequenced rice cultivars in  <dig> rice project and  <dig> diverse wild rice of o. rufipogon, our research had detected  <dig> dr-is and  <dig> dr-iis, which covered 890 kb and 640 kb regions, and harbored  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the results suggested that both dr-is and dr-iis might have originated from the indo-china peninsula to southern china. in addition, functional bias with significant positive selection has been detected in the genes of dr-i, suggesting that the selective sweep with significant positive selection might drive for the differentiation of the japonica and indica rice subspecies.
