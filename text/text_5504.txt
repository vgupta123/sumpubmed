BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is the most common gram-negative bacterium causing community-acquired pneumonia and up to 5% of community-acquired urinary tract infections  <cit> . community-acquired pneumonia is a very severe illness with a rapid onset, and despite the availability of an adequate antibiotic regimen, the outcome is often fatal. the observed mortality rates are about 50%  <cit> . capsule polysaccharide , siderophores, lipopolysaccharide  and adhesins are virulence factors identified for this pathogen. however, most of the studies have focused on the role of cps in klebsiella virulence. early studies suggested that an extracellular toxic complex mainly composed of cps triggers extensive lung tissue damage  <cit>  and data indicate that there might be a correlation between the production of this extracellular complex and klebsiella virulence  <cit> . similar to cpss from other pathogens, klebsiella cps is responsible for resistance to complement mediated killing  <cit>  and impedes adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells  <cit>  by sterically preventing receptor-target recognition of bacterial adhesins  <cit> . recently we have demonstrated that cps mediates resistance to antimicrobial peptides , trapping aps and thus acting as a bacterial decoy  <cit> .

few studies have analysed cellular features of the interaction between lung epithelium and k. pneumoniae, the role of virulence factors such as cps, and the relevance of this interaction in vivo. we have recently shown that an isogenic cps mutant activates host cellular inflammatory responses and that cps might prevent this activation through blockage of bacterial uptake  <cit> . moreover, klebsiella infection increases the expression levels of toll-like receptors  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . this increased expression of tlrs results in an enhancement of the cellular response upon stimulation with pam3csk <dig> or lipopolysaccharide, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> agonists, respectively  <cit> . in this study, we show for the first time that k. pneumoniae exerts a cytotoxic effect on airway epithelial cells that is associated with the presence of cps.

methods
bacterial strains
k. pneumoniae strains  <dig> and  <dig> are clinical isolates belonging to serotypes o1:k <dig> and o1:k <dig>  respectively  <cit> . k. pneumoniae strain  <dig>  belongs to serotype o1:k <dig>  k. pneumoniae 52k <dig> is a derivative of strain  <dig> which lacks cps  <cit> . k. pneumoniae strains were cultured in luria-bertani  medium at 37°c.

cps purification and quantification
cell-bound cps was purified by the phenol-water method  <cit> . briefly, bacteria were grown in  <dig> l lb-broth in  <dig> l flasks in an orbital shaker  for  <dig> h at 37°c. cells were removed by centrifugation and washed once with pbs. the pellet was extracted with phenol, and polysaccharides present in the aqueous phase were precipitated by adding  <dig> volumes of methanol plus 1%  of a saturated solution of sodium acetate in methanol. after incubation for  <dig> h at -20°c, the pellet was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in distilled water, dialysed against water and freeze-dried. for further purification, this preparation was dispersed  in  <dig> % nacl/ <dig> % nan3/ <dig>  m tris-hcl  and digested with nucleases  for  <dig> h at 37°c. proteinase k was added , and the mixture was incubated for  <dig> h at 55°c and for  <dig> h at room temperature. the proteinase k digestion was repeated twice and the polysaccharides were precipitated as described above. the pellet was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in distilled water. lps was removed by ultracentrifugation  and samples were freeze-dried. the enzymatic treatment and ultracentrifugation steps were repeated once. this cps preparation was repurified by the method described by hirschfeld and co-workers  <cit> . this method is widely used to remove proteins from polysaccharide preparations. sds-page-resolved preparations were transferred to pvdf membrane which was stained with colloidal gold to visualize proteins  <cit> . no trace of contaminant proteins was found . cps was quantified by determining the concentration of uronic acid in the samples, using a modified carbazole assay  <cit>  as described by rahn and whitfield  <cit> . lps presence was determined by measuring the 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid  content by the thiobarbituric acid method modified to correct interference due to deoxysugars  <cit> . kdo content was less than  <dig> %.

mammalian cell culture and bacterial infection
monolayers of human lung carcinoma cells  derived from type ii pneumocytes were grown to confluence as described before  <cit> . cells were serum starved for  <dig> h before infection. overnight-grown bacteria were subcultured and grown to exponential phase, harvested by centrifugation  and resuspended in pbs. the inoculum for the infection was prepared in earle's buffered salt solution , ph  <dig> . a <dig> cells  seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates were subsequently infected with k. pneumoniae strains at a multiplicity of infection  ranging from 100: <dig> to 1000: <dig> and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g at 22°c. infected plates were then incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> h at 37°c/5% co <dig> in a humidified incubator. for adhesion assays, cells were washed five times with  <dig> ml phosphate-buffered saline  ph  <dig>  after  <dig> h of infection and lysed with  <dig> %-triton in pbs. serial dilutions of the lysates in pbs were plated on lb plates for quantification of viable bacteria. experiments were carried out in triplicate in three independent occasions and results are expressed as % adhesion =  <dig> × . where indicated, bacteria were uv killed by exposure to  <dig> joule for  <dig> min in a bio-link blx crosslinker .

fluorescence microscopy
cell monolayers were fixed in  <dig> % paraformaldehyde in pbs. rhodamine -conjugated phalloidin  diluted 1: <dig> in 10% horse serum/ <dig> % saponin in pbs was used to stain the actin cytoskeleton. coverslips were washed twice in pbs containing  <dig> % saponin, once in pbs, and incubated for  <dig> min with phalloidin-rrx. the coverslips were then washed twice in  <dig> % saponin in pbs, once in pbs and once in h2o, mounted in aqua-poly/mount  and analysed with a leica ctr <dig> fluorescence microscope.

analysis of host cell dna integrity after k. pneumoniae infection
a <dig> cells were infected with k. pneumoniae strains at moi of 500: <dig> in tissue culture plates.  <dig> h post-infection, cells  from  <dig> wells were collected in pbs by scraping and lysed in  <dig> μl cold lysis buffer . proteinase k  was added and samples were incubated for  <dig> h at 55°c. samples were cooled to 22°c and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml rnase  for  <dig> min at 37°c.  <dig> μl  <dig> m potassium acetate were added and samples were centrifuged . dna present in the supernatants was precipitated with isopropanol, washed in 70% ethanol and dissolved in sterile water. dna integrity was analysed by staining with ethidium bromide after resolving the samples by gel-electrophoresis in 1% agarose in tae.

cell cytotoxicity and viability assays
a <dig> cells  were infected with k. pneumoniae strains . lactate dehydrogenase  release was measured using a commercial kit . per cent cytotoxicity was calculated as: /* <dig>  od <dig> max was obtained with the provided lysis positive control. measure of formazan production from reduction of mts tetrazolium by metabolically active cells was performed using cells cultured in 96-well plates. formazan production  was measured using a kit  and calculated as: od <dig> sample/od <dig> max* <dig>  od <dig> max was obtained from a monolayer of non-infected cells. ethidium bromide is taken up by host cells when cytoplasmic membrane integrity is lost, staining nuclei red when visualised by fluorescence microscopy. cells were cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates and infected as described above .  <dig> min before the end of the infection, culture medium was removed and wells were washed with  <dig> ml pbs. cells were stained for  <dig> min with  <dig> μl of  <dig> tm ethidium bromide prepared in pbs, washed three times with  <dig> ml pbs, fixed with  <dig> % paraformaldehyde in pbs, and mounted for immunofluorescence analysis as described above. cytotoxicity  was quantified by counting a minimum of  <dig> cells in three independent experiments.

mouse pneumonia model
overnight-grown bacteria were subcultured and grown to exponential phase. bacteria were centrifuged , resuspended in pbs and adjusted to  <dig> ×  <dig> colony-forming units /ml. five to seven-week-old female c57bi/6j mice were anaesthetized by i.p. injection with a mixture containing ketamine  and xylazine .  <dig> μl of bacterial suspension were inoculated intranasally in  <dig> ×  <dig> μl aliquots.  <dig> or  <dig> h post-infection the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and trachea, spleen and liver were dissected, weighed and homogenized in  <dig> ml pbs. serial dilutions of the homogenates in pbs were plated on lb agar to determine c.f.u. per gram of tissue.

statistics
statistical analyses were performed with prism <dig> for pc  using the analysis of variance  or the two-sample t test or, when the requirements were not met, by the mann-whitney u test. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
k. pneumoniae induces a cytotoxic effect in lung epithelial cells
a <dig> lung epithelial cells were infected with k. pneumoniae  <dig> , a highly capsulated strain  for  <dig> h with different mois and the host actin cytoskeleton was stained. this is a sensitive method to detect whether a pathogen induces cytoskeleton disturbances which can be associated with host cell cytotoxicity  <cit> . actin cytoskeleton staining revealed that cells rounded up at moi 500: <dig> , followed by detachment from the substrate. at moi 1000: <dig> a cytotoxic effect on the cell monolayer was observed . to determine the minimal infection requirements for cell rounding, cells were infected with different mois for  <dig> to  <dig> h. cell rounding was observed when cells were infected at moi 500: <dig> for  <dig> h . to investigate whether the cytotoxic effect was strain dependent two additional k. pneumoniae strains were tested. strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  also induced cell rounding . cps amounts expressed by these strains,  <dig> and  <dig> μg per  <dig> c.f.u., respectively, are lower than that expressed by strain  <dig> , indicating that klebsiella-induced cytotoxicity is not absolutely dependent on the amount of cps expressed.

next, we asked whether live bacteria are necessary to induce cell rounding. the bacterial inoculum was killed by uv radiation and used to infect cells . under these conditions, strain  <dig> did not induce cell rounding . in order to corroborate this observation, a mock infection was carried out, i.e. same infection conditions as before, but in a tissue culture well without cells. after  <dig> h, the bacterial suspension was uv irradiated and used to infect a confluent cell monolayer for  <dig> h. cell rounding was not observed . in addition, the strain 52145-triggered cytotoxic effect was not induced by primed bacteria-free conditioned medium, since a <dig> monolayers remained intact after  <dig> h of exposure to bacteria-free medium obtained from previously infected cells  . taken together, these findings demonstrate that k. pneumoniae strain  <dig> induces a cytotoxic effect through a process requiring the presence of live bacteria.

k. pneumoniae-induced cytotoxicity is dependent on the presence of cps
we sought to pinpoint bacterial factor responsible for strain 52145-triggered cytotoxicity. taken into account that several studies have demonstrated the important role of cps in the interplay between k. pneumoniae and eukaryotic host cells, we asked whether cps might play a role in the klebsiella-induced cytotoxicity. we studied whether an isogenic cps mutant of  <dig>  strain 52k <dig>  <cit> , would induce cytotoxicity. immunofluorescence analysis of the actin cytoskeleton of infected a <dig> cells showed that strain 52k <dig> did not induce cytotoxicity under all conditions tested, hence suggesting that cps could be one of the bacterial factors involved in 52145-triggered cytotoxicity . furthemore, the lack of cytotoxicity during 52k <dig> infection was not due to a decrease in bacterial adhesion levels because 52k <dig> adhesion levels to a <dig> cells were actually higher than those displayed by cps-expressing strains . even though cytotoxicity by non-capsulated strain was at some extent promoted by addition of purified cps during infection, purified cps alone did not trigger a cytotoxic effect , suggesting that additional bacterial elements besides cps may contribute to cytotocixity during k. pneumoniae infection.

to further characterize the cytotoxic effect induced by  <dig>  cell toxicity was assessed by four independent methods:  lactate dehydrogenase  release,  production of formazan,  analysis of dna integrity, and  uptake of ethidium bromide. ldh release, taken as an indicator of host cell membrane integrity and cell viability, was measured in supernatants of cells infected with strains  <dig> or 52k <dig>  and compared to that released by non-infected cells . k. pneumoniae strain  <dig>  triggered  <dig>  ±  <dig> % cytotoxicity, which was approximately  <dig>  times higher than that induced by strain 52k <dig> . formazan is produced by reduction of mts tetrazolium by metabolically active cells and thus serves as an indicator of cell viability. formazan production  was lower in strain 52145-infected cells  than in non-infected  or 52k10-infected cells . dna fragmentation is taken as a sign of cell death by apoptosis. a prominent dna laddering/degradation could be seen after  <dig> h of infection with k. pneumoniae strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . however, dna extracted from cells infected with strain 52k <dig> was intact, similar to dna obtained from non-infected cells . finally, we analysed the uptake of ethidium bromide by infected cells. ethidium bromide is taken up by the cells only when integrity of the plasma membrane is lost. red fluorescence staining of nuclei is therefore an indicator of plasma membrane integrity loss. the percentage of cells which had taken up the dye was higher in 52145-infected cells  than in 52k10-infected cells  or in non-infected cells . representative pictures are shown in fig. 3b.

in summary, these findings indicate that k. pneumoniae alters host cell viability in a process dependent on the presence of cps.

correlation between k. pneumoniae-induced cell cytotoxicity and virulence
it is well known that cps is essential for k. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia  <cit>  and we have established here that klebsiella-induced cytotoxicity depends on the presence of cps. we sought then to determine whether induction of cytotoxicity is sufficient for k. pneumoniae virulence using an intranasal model of infection. as an infection marker, we determined the bacterial loads in lung, liver and spleen for k. pneumoniae strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  strain  <dig> successfully infected mouse lungs  and disseminated to liver  and spleen . no decrease in the bacterial load, which was higher in lung than in liver and spleen, was observed in any organ at  <dig> h post-infection. strains  <dig> and  <dig>  both inducing cytotoxicity, displayed an intermediate virulence phenotype. strain  <dig> was detected in lungs, with similar recovery at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection. systemic infection was delayed until  <dig> h post-infection. strain  <dig> was equally recovered from lungs at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection. spleen and liver colonization were hardly observed at any time. as a control, we determined the bacterial loads in lung, liver and spleen of the cps mutant strain 52k <dig>  as reported previously  <cit> , this mutant was attenuated. viable counts recovered from lung were significantly lower than those for capsulated strains at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection and bacteria could not be recovered from liver or spleen at any time post-infection.

therefore, although cytotoxicity is likely to be associated with virulence, strains expressing different capsule levels were not equally virulent, suggesting that additional bacterial factors could be involved in virulence, or that the cytotoxic effect is necessary, but not sufficient, for virulence.

discussion
in this study, we show that k. pneumoniae triggers a cytotoxic effect upon infection of human lung epithelial cells. this process requires the presence of capsulated live bacteria through the time of infection. to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reporting that k. pneumoniae might exert a cytotoxic effect on airway epithelial cells. our results could point to the underlying mechanism behind the early findings reported by straus et al.,  <cit>  which indicated that k. pneumoniae expressing cps induces extensive lung tissue damage.

a number of bacterial pathogens induce cytotoxicity in eukaryotic cells, which is frequently dependent on an active type iiisecretion system . for example, enteropathogenic escherichia coli induces detachment of infected epithelial cells from the substratum and injects the t3ss effector cif into cells, which induces a cytopathic effect  <cit> . bordetella bronchiseptica's necrotic effect on epithelial cells is dependent on the t3ss effector bopb  <cit> , and also pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes t3ss-dependent cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells  <cit> . yet, k. pneumoniae-induced cytotoxicity does not seem to be related to a t3ss, given that in silico analysis of the so far sequenced k. pneumoniae genomes does not identify any t3ss components. furthermore, pcr analysis using degenerated primers to amplify lcrd homologues present in all known t3ss were negative in all our klebsiella strains. recently, it has been shown that p. aeruginosa and enterotoxigenic e. coli deliver toxins directly into host cell cytoplasm using outer membrane vesicles  <cit> . it is likely that k. pneumoniae also produces outer membrane vesicles. in fact, the extracellular toxic complex described by straus  <cit>  could be considered a preparation of outer membrane vesicles. it is then tempting to speculate that outer membrane vesicles could be associated with k. pneumoniae cytotoxicity described in our study. future studies will aim to address this possibility. on the other hand, our results clearly establish that cps is necessary for the induction of cytotoxicity. cps is a virulence factor for several pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae type b and e. coli k <dig>  <cit> . of note, no previous reports link the presence of cps to cytotoxicity. however, just the presence of cps is not sufficient for k. pneumoniae-induced cytotoxicity because capsulated uv-killed bacteria or purified cps did not induce this effect. given the limited current knowledge about k. pneumoniae virulence factors, we can only speculate on the nature of bacterial factor that, together with cps, could promote cytotoxicity in the host. signature-tagged mutagenesis approaches have identified several virulence factors  <cit> , but none of them resemble those triggering the cytotoxicity by other bacterial pathogens.

all k. pneumoniae clinical isolates are capsulated, inferring the importance of cps for virulence. likewise, cps is necessary for virulence in an in vivo pneumonia model  <cit>  and for klebsiella-induced cytotoxicity . however, our data indicate that cps-dependent cytoxicity is necessary but not sufficient for klebsiella virulence because strains  <dig> and  <dig> are less virulent than strain  <dig> and the three of them trigger cytotoxicity. this could be explained by differences in the amount of cps expressed by these strains, although strain  <dig> is also considered to be heavily capsulated. the absence of complete correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies has been previously described for other k. pneumoniae isolates. struve et al., showed that cps expression reduced k. pneumoniae adhesion to gut and bladder epithelium, when compared to a noncapsulated mutant. however, the presence/absence of cps had no effect on the colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract, but did play a role in colonisation of the urinary tract  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been recently postulated that there is an association between cps serotype, virulence in mice and humans, and frequency of isolation in clinical settings  <cit> . however, the bacterial strains tested in this study express cps belonging to serotypes considered to have high potential of causing disease  <cit> , and strains  <dig> and  <dig> express the same cps serotype. nevertheless, klebsiella infections should be looked at as the outcome of specific interactions between pathogen and host cells. indeed, factors on both pathogen and host sides may be involved in the progression of the infection. in this context, it is widely accepted that host innate immunity plays a key role to clear k. pneumoniae infections. therefore, differences among strains in the resistance to complement and/or to antimicrobial peptides mediated killing may account for differences in virulence  <cit> . in addition, a wealth of evidence clearly indicates the importance of the inflammatory responses in clearing k. pneumoniae infection and have provided substantial evidence for the protective role of a th1-mediated response  <cit> . thus, differences in the induction of inflammatory responses among strains may also underline in vivo behavior. in summary the available data support the notion that cps-dependent cytotoxicity, together with other bacterially triggered events, is required for virulence. further studies will attempt to elucidate these novel virulence mechanisms, which may differ among capsulated strains, in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of k. pneumoniae pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study allocates a novel role to k. pneumoniae capsule, i.e. the induction of cytotoxicity during the infection of lung epithelial cells. this effect, which has been analysed by using four different approaches, is not capsule serotype dependent, does require the presence of live bacteria, and does not seem to be directly related to bacterial adhesion. host cell cytotoxicity could be associated with virulence. however, strains expressing different capsule levels were not equally virulent, suggesting that additional bacterial elements could be involved in klebsiella virulence.
