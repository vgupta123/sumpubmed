BACKGROUND
tblr <dig> is a transcriptional regulator interacting with the co-repressors of nuclear hormone receptor activity. we cloned the gene encoding this protein and identified it as a member of a small family of proteins that include at least two isoforms encoded by the same gene and closely related, x- and y linked proteins, called tbl1x and tbl1y. the tblr <dig> protein interacts with nhr , a class of molecules that plays a critical role in transcription  <cit> . these co-repressors mediate the down-regulation of gene expression and play important roles in the life and death choices that regulate normal development.

the nuclear hormone receptor  superfamily is a large family of mainly ligand-dependent transcription factors that play a role in the regulation of reproduction, growth, differentiation, and homeostasis. members of the family share several structural features including a conserved dna binding domain  that targets the receptor to hormone response element  sequences. the carboxyl-end of the receptors contains a ligand-binding domain  in which is embedded a hormone-dependent transcriptional activation domain. the lbd serves as a molecular switch that recruits co-activator or co-repressor proteins that regulate transcription of the target genes. ligand-dependent receptors like the thyroid hormone receptor  and retinoic acid receptor  stimulate transcription when ligand is bound and repress it when the ligand is absent  <cit> .

n-cor  <cit>  and smrt  and transducin -like i . the hdac3-containing, smrt and n-cor complexes can bind to unliganded thyroid hormone receptors  in vitro <cit> . although both co-repressors are expressed widely, extensive hematological abnormalities, including blocks in erythrocyte and t-cell development  <cit> , follow targeted deletion of n-cor.

co-repressors mediate transcriptional silencing by inhibiting the basal transcription machinery and by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes  <cit>  histone deacetylation, which produces a more compact chromatin structure that is inaccessible to transcriptional activators  <cit> , appears to be the predominant means of chromatin modification. studies of rar and t3r show that ligand binding leads to the displacement of an hdac-containing complex from the nuclear receptor in exchange for a histone acetyltransferase -containing complex and this may serve as a general mechanism for switching nuclear receptors from a transcriptionally repressive to a transcriptionally active state  <cit> . changes in repression correlate with alterations in the level of n-cor and/or smrt. these levels are regulated by both the rate of synthesis of the co-repressors and, more dramatically, by their rate of degradation. targeted proteolysis of transcriptional co-regulators has been established as a mechanism for cell-specific regulation of gene transcription  <cit> . although the composition of the repressor complex is not fully understood, both tblr <dig> and a protein called tbl <dig> that is highly homologous to tblr <dig>  are present and in some cells, the extent of transcriptional repression correlates with the amount of tbl <dig> present  <cit> .

we originally isolated tblr <dig> as a  <dig> bp fragment in a cdna library prepared from a bone marrow preparation highly enriched for human hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . this fragment, which had no homology with any sequence in the genbank, hybridized with rna from k <dig>  and a placental library and cdnas prepared from these tissues were used as a source of mrnas for subsequent analysis. 5' race identified an open reading frame  encoding a putative  <dig> a.a. protein. in this paper, we report the structure of the tblr <dig> gene and analyze its pattern of expression. these results indicate that alternative splicing of the mrna results in the formation of at least two protein isoforms . over expression of tblr <dig> interferes with cell replication. like tbl <dig>  tblr <dig> forms a complex with nuclear co-repressors and appears to play a role in stabilizing the active co-repressor complex.

RESULTS
the tblr <dig> family
human tblr <dig> exists as two isoforms that differ at their carboxyl end. the original isolate  and in vitro translation of an rna prepared from the full-length cdna, yielded a product of the predicted size . because the size of the assembled sequence  was significantly smaller than the  <dig>  kb message identified by northern blotting , a series of primers were constructed for use in 3' race in an attempt to identify rna sequences that extended beyond the poly a site that characterized the 3' end of the original molecule. while none of these attempts was successful, primers selected from the middle of the orf  revealed the existence of two messages that were identical at their 5' ends but differed at their 3' ends. the second of these mrnas is termed tblr1β . examination of the genomic sequence encoding tblr <dig> revealed that these were produced by the failure of recognition of the splice donor site that normally demarcates the end of exon  <dig>  in the variant, the following intron is not removed from the transcribed mrna. it is translated to produce the alternative beta form. thus the two isoforms are identical through exon  <dig> but the 15th exon of the beta variant is encoded by a sequence that begins immediately after exon  <dig> without an intervening splice. while the exon  <dig> of the alpha form is encoded by a sequence located  <dig> bp down stream. the deduced amino acid sequences of the divergent carboxyl-ends are included in the materials and methods section.

the nucleic acid sequence encoding tblr1α is highly conserved. at the nucleic acid level the similarity in the open reading frame between the human and mouse genes is 89% but interestingly, in the 3' utr, the first  <dig> bp have the same degree of similarity  as the open reading frame. the next several  <dig> bp contain several smaller regions  of almost complete identity. the sequence of the human mrna recorded in genbank  is  <dig> bp; the homologous murine sequence  containing the open reading frame is  <dig> bp but the 3' end of this sequence shares a  <dig> bp overlap with the 5' end of a  <dig> bp cdna sequence , suggesting that the full-length message is actually at least  <dig> bp. the human  and mouse proteins are remarkably similar .

tblr <dig> has a high degree of similarity  to a pair of proteins encoded on the x and y chromosomes . these proteins are also highly homologous to a drosophila protein known as ebi  as well as to anopheles gambiae  and arabidopsis thaliana  proteins. the yeast protein sif2p, a sir <dig> interacting factor  is 43% similar, indicating wide evolutionary conservation. highly homologous proteins have also been found in chimpanzees, dogs, cows fish and chickens. the relationships among the proteins are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

the tblr <dig> protein contains a series of wd <dig> repeats that are permuted with respect to the structural repeats  of the β propeller domain. the amino-terminal end contains a perfect copy of the lissencephaly type-1-like homology motif , an α-helical motif present in numerous wd <dig> repeat-containing proteins.

genomic structure of htblr1
tblr <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> at 3q <dig>  the gene occupies ~ <dig>  bp and the coding structure is assembled from  <dig> exons. neither the first nor the last of these are included in the current genebank assembly but are included here as result of northern blotting evidence. the translational start site is located in the 5th exon and is ~ <dig> kb downstream from the first exon. the actual 3' end of the gene extends at least  <dig>  kb beyond the sequence that we originally reported  <cit> . a probe synthesized to detect the hypothetical protein dc <dig>  which is located 3' of the previously characterized end of tblr <dig>  hybridizes with the mrna encoding tblr <dig> . the sequence reported for dc <dig> encodes a putative small  intronless protein that has no significant similarity to any other protein in genbank from any organism. the mouse sequence is assembled from  <dig> exons and is located on chromosome  <dig> . the structure of the human gene is shown in figure  <dig> 

expression of tblr1
the expression of the messages for tblr <dig>  as well as that for tbl1x were examined using quantitative real time pcr. the results are shown in figure 3a. expression varies widely from tissue to tissue. in many tissues, including thymus, spleen, thyroid, lung and brain tblr <dig> expression exceeded tbl <dig>  on the other hand, in ovary, prostate and placenta, which have the highest overall levels of these mrnas tbl <dig> greatly exceeded tblr <dig>  little correlation was found between tblr <dig> expression and tbl <dig> expression  but expression of tblr1β, the splice variant, generally correlated with the expression of the predominant alpha form . the proportion of the splice variant varied from tissue to tissue but in no case was it the predominant form. northern analyses with probes from different regions of the tblr <dig> message  produced complex results. a probe from the 3' untranslated region detects a  <dig>  kb transcript in many tissues. hybridization with a probe containing the 5' end of the orf identified  <dig> mrnas. in addition to the  <dig>  kb band there is an abundant  <dig>  kb message and a variably expressed band of ~ <dig>  kb that is most often detected in hematopoietic tissues. mouse tissues show a similar pattern. an oligonucleotide probe specific for the 3' end of tblr1β detected only the  <dig>  kb mrna. hybridization with a probe designed to detect the theoretical protein dc <dig>  which maps  <dig>  kb downstream from the presumed 3' terminus of the message, hybridizes with a  <dig>  kb message that appears to be identical to the one detected by probes that hybridize with the orf. hybridization with a probe designed to detect the cdna sequence  also detects the  <dig>  kb transcript of tblr <dig>  this sequence was identified in a human mammary cdna library and maps in the large first intron deduced from the genomic sequence. it is not present in either our original isolate or any of the subsequently isolated clones. its presence in the predominant transcript detected by northern analysis of tblr <dig> indicates the presence of additional splice variants of this gene. hybridization with this probe also detects an ~ <dig>  kb rna whose origin is unknown. no sequences that are homologous to  have been detected on the x or y chromosomes where tbl <dig> is located.

western blots were prepared using three polyclonal anti tblr <dig> peptide antibodies; antibodies directed against the carboxyl end of tblr1α and tblr1β and an antiserum specific for the region of maximal difference between tblr <dig> and tbl <dig>  this later antiserum does not react with tbl <dig> at all and enabled us to distinguish between tblr <dig> and tbl <dig> in mouse tissues. tblr <dig> was first isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using the antiserum that distinguishes between tblr <dig> and tbl <dig> and the eluted material was electrophoresed and then blotted with anti tblr1α and anti tblr1β antisera. the pattern produced by anti tblr1α using mouse tissues is shown in figure 4a. the anti tblr1β antiserum is unfortunately not useful for western blotting. despite our inability to detect the mouse beta form by western blotting, complex patterns that varied from tissue to tissue were observed when the antibody that detects both isoforms was used. a component with the molecular mass  predicted by the sequence of the orf  is present in most tissues but in some tissues, an additional component at ~ <dig> kda was also detected. the larger component was found in both mouse and human hematopoietic tissues  and is prominent in extracts of mouse testes. the addition of soluble peptide to the diluted antiserum inhibited all of the staining . in mouse bone marrow the predominant form is also a  <dig> kda peptide. the highest levels of tblr <dig> are present in fetal liver and immunohistochemical staining shows strong staining of hematopoietic cells in the developing liver . the immunohistochemical results indicate that the predominant isotype in the fetal liver is the beta form.

the human kidney cell line 293t expresses readily detectable quantities of tblr <dig> . anti tblr1α produces a single band at ~ <dig> kda, while anti tblr1β detects only a larger band at ~ <dig> kda. the results obtained with the antibody that distinguishes between tblr <dig> and tbl <dig> are also shown in figure 4b. this antibody, made with a peptide unique to tblr <dig>  is directed at an epitope shared by both the α and β isoforms and detects both bands. the results are particularly informative since they demonstrate; 1) more than one form of tblr <dig> exists. 2) the β-isoform identified by 5'race and quantified by quantitative real time pcr, encodes an expressed protein; 3) a single cell type produces more than one isoform; and 4) the higher molecular weight form detected by the antibody to the c-terminal fragment of the β form is likely to be tblr <dig> and not tbl <dig>  although the peptide used for the immunization of the animals that made the affinity absorbed antibody is not present in tbl <dig>  the possibility that tbl <dig> forms a heterodimer with tblr <dig> and is thus co-precipitated by anti tblr <dig> has not been completely eliminated.

intracellular localization of tblr1
to determine the intracellular localization of tblr <dig>  the anti-peptide antibodies described above were used in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. the target cells were mouse 3t <dig> fibroblasts. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  in 3t <dig> growing under normal conditions, the staining is primarily cytoplasmic . in serum-starved cells, the staining increased dramatically and nuclear  and nuclear staining became prominent. after treatment with camptothecin , the intensity of both cytoplasmic  and nuclear staining increased. staining for total tblr <dig>  or just tblr1β gave qualitatively similar results but anti tblr1β staining was almost totally nuclear after serum starvation but remained predominantly cytoplasmic after cpt. the increase in nuclear staining suggests that under conditions of stress tblr <dig> levels increase, and suggests a physiologic role for tblr <dig> in the response to these stimuli.

interaction of tblr <dig> with smrt
the interaction of tblr <dig> with components of the transcription regulatory complex can be demonstrated by both gst "pull-down" and co-precipitation. labeled tblr <dig> prepared by in vitro translation using 35s methionine can be "pulled-down" by an immobilized amino terminal fragment of smrt. as shown in figure 6a, full-length tblr <dig> is pulled down by gst smrt but does not bind to a control gst column. truncated forms of tblr <dig> lacking the f-box , the n-terminal 44aa  indicating that both the putative f-box and the n-terminus are critical for a high affinity interaction of tblr <dig> with smrt. a fragment consisting only of the first  <dig> a.a. was as efficient as the full-length protein in reacting with smrt.

we have also confirmed that tblr <dig> associates with hdac <dig>  in cells transfected with either his-tagged hdac <dig> alone or his-tagged hdac <dig> along with a flag-tagged tblr <dig>  the flag-tagged tblr <dig> binds only to ni-agarose columns that have bound hdac .

effect of co-transfection of tblr <dig> on smrt and ncor expression
expression of the smrt truncate is greatly increased in cells expressing both smrt and tblr <dig>  truncated forms of tblr <dig>  more than the wild type molecule . the effect is seen with the fragment that binds smrt  and one that lacks the n-terminal binding site for n-cor or smrt . the expression of the tblr <dig> mutants varied considerably after transfection. the greatest increase in smrt expression  was produced by co-transfection with tblr <dig> , which was also the most highly expressed tblr <dig> protein. however the next most effective protein was tblr <dig>  , which was the least expressed of the three tblr <dig> proteins. co-transfection with full-length tblr <dig> resulted in an ~ <dig> fold increase in smrt. co-transfection with siah- <dig>  a factor known to contribute to the targeting of n-cor for proteolytic destruction did not affect smrt expression. these results were obtained analyzing the transient expression of a smrt fragment.

to confirm their physiologic relevance of these results, the experiment was repeated with cells engineered to stably express the tblr <dig> constructs as a consequence of retroviral infection. the expression of endogenous n-cor in these lines was examined using western blotting . the results were similar to those found after co-expression of the tblr <dig> truncates and the smrt fragment. all of the lines that ectopically expressed tblr <dig> or its truncates showed increased steady state expression of n-cor to assure that the increase in protein expression was not a consequence increased mrna expression, the expression of n-cor message was assessed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr . gapdh was used as a control. the levels of n-cor mrna in cell lines that expressed tblr <dig>  tblr <dig>  or tblr <dig>  were indistinguishable from the control line.

effect of proteasome inhibitors on smrt expression
to demonstrate that the levels of smrt found in cos  <dig> cells are controlled by ubiquitination we treated the transfected cells with mg <dig> in dmso or with dmso as a control and measured the level of smrt by western blotting as described above. mg  <dig>  is a potent, membrane-permeable proteasome inhibitor <cit> . to control for differences in cell survival etc., the cos cells were co-transfected with a vector that expressed gfp along with the his-smrt vector. gfp is not degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. as shown in figure  <dig>  mg <dig> treated cos <dig> cells express levels of smrt that are ~ <dig> times those found in the dmso control. only a relatively small difference in gfp expression was observed.

effect of ectopic expression of tblr <dig> on cell growth
transient expression of tblr1or the truncated form lacking the wd <dig> domains in hk <dig> t cells leads to growth arrest. after transfection almost half of the cells that expressed full-length tblr <dig> or the truncated form lacking the c-terminal half of the molecule  fail to undergo a single round of mitosis within  <dig> days. this non-proliferative fraction, which was  <dig>  after the control transfection, increased to  <dig>  ;  <dig>   and  <dig>   after transfection with tblr <dig> constructs. the proportion of cells that divided  <dig> times  was reduced from 25% after transfection with the control vector to between  <dig> and 11% after transfection with tblr <dig> or its truncates. the interference with growth was apparent even among cells that escaped the initial block. the proliferative index  decreased from  <dig>  after transfection with the empty vector to  <dig>  ;  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the results are illustrated in figure 9a and summarized in table  <dig>  transfection with tblr <dig>  produced a more modest block than transfection with either the fill-length material or tblr <dig> .

stable ectopic expression of tblr <dig> also alters the growth properties of jurkat cells. the growth rate of cells infected with retroviruses containing the same constructs used in the transient experiments is shown in figure 9b. in  <dig> independent experiments, cells over expressing full-length tblr <dig> or the truncated form lacking the c-terminal half of the molecule  show a significant reduction in growth rate. cells expressing tblr <dig>  grew at a rate that was statistically indistinguishable from cells infected with a virus containing only gfp. to determine the basis for the reduced growth rate, cells in the log phase of growth, were stained with propidium iodide to determine their dna content. the results  show a consistent reduction in the proportion of cells in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle in cells expressing either full length tblr <dig> or tblr <dig> . this decrease in g2/m cells is associated with increases in the proportion of cells in both the g0/g <dig> and s phases of the cycle, suggesting that over-expression of tblr <dig> can contribute to both g0/g <dig> and s phase arrest. this results is consistent with the known effects of hdac  and chromatin remodeling complexes  in regulating cell division.  <cit> .

discussions and 
CONCLUSIONS
tblr <dig> gene is expressed widely and northern analysis, using sequences from the orf as a probe, revealed size heterogeneity of the expressed mrnas . these are due to both the presence of alternatively spliced messages and the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites. the  <dig>  kb form is more abundant in hematopoietic tissues. in addition to the heterogeneity in message size, the protein also has several isoforms. the isoforms are produced by the use of alternative splice donor sites. tblr1β, differs from the original sequence at the carboxyl-terminus . the mouse homologue shows mrna size heterogeneity that is similar to the human rna. both the human and mouse genes have a complex and somewhat unusual genomic structure. the human gene contains  <dig> highly conserved exons spread over  <dig> kb of genomic dna. the first and second exons are ~ <dig> kb upstream of the third, which in turn, is separated from the fourth exon by  <dig> kb of intronic dna. the translational start site is located an additional  <dig> kb downstream in the middle of the fifth exon. the gene also has an extremely long 3'utr that includes a sequence deposited in genbank as dc <dig>  this is described as an intronless gene for which there is no independent evidence of expression and may not actually encode a functional message. human tblr <dig> maps to chromosome 3q <dig> while mouse tblr <dig> is located between 3a <dig> and 3a <dig> 

the broad evolutionary conservation of this gene family is of note. homologs are present in yeast, plants, fish and flies as well as in mammals and the insect proteins are > 80% similar to the mammalian ones. no homology was detected to prokaryotic genomes.

the cdnas for tblr <dig> encode members of the β-transducin or wd-repeat family  <cit> . eight wd-repeats are present in both the human and mouse proteins. the splice site that distinguishes between tblr1α and tblr1β is immediately 3' of the last wd-repeat sequence signature. at the nucleotide level, the sequence of tblr1α has 79% homology to homo sapiens mrna for transducin - <dig> like protein  . the only homology of tblr <dig> and tbl <dig> to the prototypic signal transducing guanine nucleotide binding regulatory  protein β sub- unit is in the wd-repeat domains. tbl <dig> has been mapped to the x chromosome and deletions in the region containing tbl <dig> are associated with adult onset sensorineural deafness <cit> . both tblr <dig> and tbl <dig> are homologous to a drosophila protein called ebi the regions of maximal nucleotide conservation between tbl <dig> and ebi are at the n-terminal end of the molecule and in the wd <dig> repeats. the c-terminal ends of these proteins are not homologous. the carboxyl terminal exon of tblr1α has some homology to several members of the arp2/ <dig> complex of proteins that control actin polymerization  <cit> . the equivalent region of tblr1β has no homology to any known protein. the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of tblr <dig> co-precipitates with both hdac <dig> and smrt. the data indicate that tblr <dig> binds directly to smrt, which in turn binds hdac <dig>  smrt binding of hdac <dig> plays an important role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression <cit>  the homologous region of tbl <dig> also co-precipitates with these co-repressors  <cit>  and has been reported to form an effective transcriptional repressor. this portion of the molecule contains a lish motif. lish is a β-propeller-binding motif and is thought to mediate the dimerization of wd- <dig> proteins  <cit>  sif2p, the yeast homolog of tblr <dig>  is a tetramer and contains an unusual eight-bladed β-propeller structure, that apparently mediates tetramerization  <cit> . mutations in conserved lish amino acids significantly reduced the half-life of tbl <dig> and altered its intracellular localization. tbl <dig> mutated in the lish domain was not imported into the nucleus  <cit> . our data indicates that elimination of the lish domain prevents interaction with smrt.

the actual role that the tblr <dig> family plays in cell physiology remains unclear. like the proverbial blind man trying to describe an elephant, each laboratory has found a role for family members in their own system. presumably, tbl <dig> and tblr <dig> are multi-functional proteins. we found tblr <dig> in a screen for messages over-expressed in early hematopoietic cells  <cit> . tbl <dig> deletions are associated with deafness  <cit> . the drosophila homolog, ebi has been reported to regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling  <cit>  promote the degradation of a repressor of neuronal differentiation , and to limit s phase entry. a cdna, described as the "human homologue of ebi" was reported to encode a protein that plays a role in the ubiquitin pathway  <cit> . more recently, both tbl <dig> and tblr <dig> were reported to be required for transcriptional activators of nuclear hormone receptors and other regulated transcription factors  <cit> . cofactor exchange through ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was proposed to account for the transcriptional activation dependent on tbl <dig> and/or tblr <dig>  yoon et al.  <cit>  were unable to find any evidence for transcriptional activation in their studies, which postulated a role for tbl1/tblr <dig> in histone code reading. knock-down experiments using small interference rna  techniques indicate that tbl <dig> and tblr <dig> are functionally redundant but essential for repression by unliganded thyroid hormone receptors  <cit> . tomita et al. used the frog oocyte system to demonstrate that unliganded tblr <dig> interacts with t3r and recruits tblr <dig> to its chromatinized target promoter in vivo, accompanied by histone deacetylation and gene repression and showed that the recruitment of tblr <dig> or related proteins is important for repression by unliganded t3r  <cit> . yoon et al. have demonstrated that there is an additional site of interaction between a site near the most n-terminal of the wd- <dig> repeats of tbl <dig> and the rd <dig> region of n-cor  <cit> . these interaction sites on smrt flank the sant motifs and it has been suggested that they play a role in interpreting the histone code and promoting histone deacetylation  <cit> . expression of a tblr <dig> fragment that contains this interaction site, but lacks the c-terminal two-thirds of the molecule including the wd- <dig> repeats, leads to a partial proliferation arrest, suggesting again, the multiplicity of roles that these family member play  <cit> .

the proteins of the tblr <dig> family also contain variant f-box near the n terminus of the molecule. f-box proteins, in combination with skp <dig> and cullin, form part of an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the targeting of phosphorylated proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. because proteolysis is irreversible, proteasomal degradation provides a unidirectional regulatory switch. the initiation of dna replication, chromosome segregation, and exit from mitosis are all triggered by the destruction of key regulatory proteins  <cit>   <cit>  the f-boxes in tblr <dig>  tbl <dig> and ebi all lack a tryptophan near the nh2-end of the motif that is associated with skp <dig> binding to f-box proteins that recognize phosphorylated protein  <cit> . a cdna, described only as the "human homologue of ebi" encodes a protein that the authors believe plays a role in the ubiquitin mediated destruction of β-catenin  <cit>  and they suggest that this ebi can bind skp <dig> and is a key component in a pathway that targets unphosphorylated proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation  <cit>   <cit> .

ectopic expression of full-length tbl <dig> potentiates repression by unliganded t3r. tbl <dig> does not bind directly to t3r; it binds to smrt and/or n-cor and this interaction was reported to contribute an autonomous repression function to the complex. the methods used in these experiments could not distinguish among the possibilities; 1) that tbl <dig> changed the structure of n-cor, perhaps by altering the accessibility of the sant motifs, producing increased repression, 2) that it increased the quantity of n-cor present in the target cells or 3) that it facilitated the recruitment of an additional co-repressor. we have shown that over expression of tblr <dig> or either the c- or n-terminal truncates increases the expression of nhr co-repressors. co-transfection of tblr <dig> with smrt leads to greatly enhanced expression of a truncated smrt in a transient expression model and cells in which tblr <dig> is stably over expressed have elevated levels of endogenous n-cor. co-transfection with the wild type tblr <dig> as well as both the n- and c-terminal truncates leads to a significant increase in both smrt and endogenous n-cor expression. thus, both ends of the molecule can independently contribute to co-repressor stabilization. alternatively, the region between a.a.  <dig> and  <dig>  and shard in all of our constructs) may play an autonomous role in increasing co-repressor expression. since smrt is degraded via a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism and inhibition of ubiquitination leads to elevation of smrt, our data suggest the possibility that tblr <dig> may act by preventing the degradation of nuclear co-repressors. this stabilization appears to be part of a complex regulatory network that governs the level of unliganded nuclear receptor. although this result is the opposite of what might have been predicted on the basis of the results described above for ebi-mediated targeting of β-catenin  <cit> both sets of data suggest that the tblr <dig> family interacts with proteins subject to proteasomal degradation and the actual outcome, protection or targeting, may depend on either the nature of the target protein or the identity of the other proteins that interact with tblr <dig>  it may also be controlled by which of the tblr <dig> family members does the interacting.

the mechanism through which the steady state level of smrt and n-cor expression is regulated is not obvious. the truncated construct of tblr <dig>  containing the c-terminal half of the molecule lacks the sequence involved in binding to the rd <dig> region of the co-repressors but has the greatest effect on both smrt and n-cor expression. although this fragment contains most of the sequence that yoon et al. suggested is responsible for binding the rd <dig> region of the co-repressor, the smrt fragment that we used lacks this rd <dig> region. thus can not identify the binding partner responsible for the increased co-repressor levels found in cells over-expressing tblr <dig>  it may be that oligimerization of tblr <dig> is required co-repressor stabilization and that a heteromeric multimer of a truncated form with the wild type may form a complex with smrt that is an unsuitable substrate for proteasomal degradation. pulse-chase experiments with co-transfected smrt suggest that ectopically expressed tblr <dig>  stabilizes smrt  but the pulse chase experiments do not provide an explanation for the increased level of smrt expression associated with co-transfection of either the n-terminal fragment of tblr <dig> or the whole molecule.

the fluorescence studies show that the intracellular distribution of tblr <dig> is influenced by the metabolic state of the cells. the increase in nuclear staining may either represent translocation to the nucleus or nuclear trapping. in either case, it is likely that the tblr <dig> that accumulates in the nucleus is degraded with different kinetics than the cytoplasmic material and that differential localization as well as alterations in proteasomal targeting, are the explanation for the effect of increased tblr <dig> expression on co-repressor levels.

these results suggest that the tbl1-tblr <dig> family plays a role in the regulation of n-cor and/or smrt expression; the amino terminal end docks the molecule to the co-repressor, perhaps altering its intracellular localization and targeting it for degradation. the carboxyl end appears to contribute to this activity but also appears to be the source of tissue specificity.

in summary, we have identified tblr <dig> as a transcriptional regulator interacting with the co-repressors of nuclear hormone receptor activity. we have cloned the gene encoding this protein and identified it as a member of a small family of proteins that include at least two isoforms encoded by the same gene and closely related, x- and y linked proteins, called tbl1x and tbl1y. the evidence suggests that these proteins act by altering the stability of the co-repressor complex and that they may also contribute, or recruit other proteins that provide, an autonomous repressor function.
