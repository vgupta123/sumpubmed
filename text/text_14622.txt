BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitously occurring post-translational modification influencing many molecular processes in all complex cells. the recognition of phosphorylation sites by specific kinases and the subsequent phosphorylation generally leads to an alteration of the structure, function, or protein binding properties of the target protein, which has evolved as a mechanism to respond to environmental changes via phosphorylation-triggered complex signaling networks and cascades and is playing a crucial role in the regulation of enzymes or transporters in metabolic processes  <cit> .

the study of phosphorylation events has been a central research topic in molecular biology for many years. given the high number of candidate phosphorylation sites, efforts to experimentally identify and verify them all remain challenging. these difficulties motivated the development of computational methods to predict potential phosphorylation sites in silico. most established computational prediction methods rely solely on the local sequence surrounding the target amino acid residue. the developed prediction methods range from simple amino acid sequence pattern recognition methods to markov models, neuronal networks, and advanced machine learning methods such as support vector machines  <cit> . many of them have been made publicly available and yield results with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, but they generally suffer from either over- or undercalling candidate sites as optimal parameters found for one particular protein target class cannot be generalized to all phosphorylation motifs  <cit> . recognizing that the information content increases significantly when the respective kinase families associated with their targets are considered separately, approaches to predict phosphorylation sites in a kinase-family specific manner based on family-specific local sequence motifs have also been presented  <cit> .

the acceptable performance of local-sequence-only methods, together with reports that phosphorylation sites appear to be preferentially located in unstructured regions of proteins suggesting a limited relevance of any structurally well-defined binding epitopes for the specific recognition of kinases and their substrate proteins  <cit> , appear to justify focusing exclusively on local sequence patterns rather than three-dimensional -structural context information. however, the significantly increased number of experimentally determined phosphorylation sites by proteomics technologies with simultaneously available 3d structures of the associated proteins in recent years and published analyses suggesting that target sites may very well assume defined structural conformations and, furthermore, that phosphorylation sites may be surrounded by specific 3d-structural environments  <cit>  motivated us to re-investigate the role of 3d-structural information for the specific recognition of kinases and their substrate proteins.

in a recently published systematic comparative and structural analysis of protein phosphorylation, jiménez and co-workers  <cit>  reported that serine and threonine phosphorylation sites exhibit only a marginal tendency to occur preferentially in structurally more flexible loops with approximately 35% actually being located in α-helices or β-strands, which can be assumed as relatively rigid secondary structural elements. and for tyrosine sites, no tendency to occur more frequently in loops was detectable at all. furthermore, they reported that a substantial number of phosphorylation sites  are actually buried inside the protein and not exposed to the solvent. an increased significance of 3d-structural context for these locations is evident. plewczynski and co-workers reported that as many as 60% of phosphorylation sites for the kinase families protein kinase a and c  are located in α-helical regions  <cit> . thus, a significant number of phosphorylation sites are actually located in structurally defined regions in which defined structural surface features and motifs may turn out to be relevant.

from studying sequence motifs associated with the protein kinase a and g , the consensus target sequence was determined as xrrxsx  <cit> . however, of  <dig> target motifs for pka in the phospho.elm database  <cit> ,  <dig> % do not contain any arginine, and  <dig> % neither arginine nor lysine in the sequential neighborhood of six residues in both directions relative to the central serine. of  <dig> targets for pkg kinases,  <dig> % of target sites do not contain any arginine, and in 6% of the targets, both arginine and lysine is absent. this observation implies that some recognition features may perhaps be localized outside of the local sequence, such that the positive-charge bearing amino acids defining the required electrostatic potential surface for binding may be contributed from sequentially distant, but spatially close rather than sequence-local sites.

in the light of these observations, it appears plausible that, although the local amino acid sequence may contain a significant portion of the information contents with regard to phosphorylation, the actual local three-dimensional environment may contribute appreciably to the specificity of the kinase – target protein molecular recognition event.

although there have been several approaches to use structural information for improved prediction of phosphorylation, they generally resulted in only modest success rates  <cit> . these unsatisfactory results can possibly be explained by an insufficient number of annotated, experimentally determined structures as well as by focusing on general structural properties such as secondary structure, rather than trying to define 3d-motifs based on spatial amino acid distributions.

fan and zhang characterized phosphorylation sites in their spatial, protein-structural context using a simplified "altman" shell model with a radius of  <dig> Å and found only minor differences of the amino acid composition around phosphorylation sites compared to average protein composition  <cit> . however, by analyzing phosphorylation sites across all kinase families, any motif that may be specific for particular kinase classes may have been masked. the identification of kinase-family-specific sequence motifs supports this view. these amino acid preferences may also be detectable using a protein structural approach which considers spatial proximity rather than sequence proximity alone.

plewczynski and co-workers applied molecular modeling to characterize the local structural context of phosphorylation sites  <cit> . in their approach, protein sequences were compared to a library of short sequence and structure motifs via a sequence matching algorithm, adapted for local 3d-structure prediction. they achieved significantly improved prediction accuracy of phosphorylation events by means of similarity scores to a library of pka and pkc targets and conclude that "sequence information ought to be supplemented with additional structural context information... for more successful predictions of phosphorylation sites in proteins."

the use of structural information for improved phosphorylation site prediction has also been explored by blom and co-workers, the authors of the popular sequence-only-based netphos predication server  <cit> . in this approach, probabilities of contacts between cα atoms of residues within spatial neighborhoods of phosphorylation sites and non-phosphorylation sites were calculated, so called contact or distance maps. in a second step, the probabilities of contacts of residues from sequences are then calculated according to those maps and used for prediction purposes. this led to markedly improved sensitivity of the prediction of phosphorylated tyrosine sites which the authors interpreted as an indication of the relevance of tertiary structural information not reflected in the sequence alone. however, this approach also led to an increase of false positive sites and, as a consequence, to overall worse prediction results.

the goal of this work was to characterize phosphorylation sites by spatial amino acid propensity distributions to generate spatial signature motifs and the subsequent assessment of this information to improve the prediction of phosphorylation sites in proteins.

as previous studies have shown that "one-fits-all" approaches; i.e., parameterization of the prediction method irrespective of kinase-family, have led to only modest success rates, we investigate here whether considering kinase-family specific 3d-motifs may reveal greater information contents and, thereby, yield improved prediction results. our method is based on support vector machines   <cit> . svms have been used in a wide range of problems in the area of molecular biology including analyses of microarray data  <cit> , string matching  <cit> , drug design  <cit> , protein fold recognition  <cit>  and prediction of phosphorylation sites using sequence information  <cit> .

we observed that 3d-motifs are indeed detectable, especially when studying kinase families individually and obtained improved prediction results by including 3d information in the prediction. we also implemented a sequence-only approach that implicitly captures 3d structural preferences associated with each of the different amino acid types by using  <dig> amino acid features which include also the generally accepted phosphorylation site features such as hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility as well as secondary and tertiary structure preferences, polarity, volume and solvent accessibility, structural disorder indices and others. this predictor has recently been developed by our group as part of a database of plant-specific phosphorylation sites. the predictor was shown to accurately identify plant phosphorylation sites and to outperform commonly available predictors  <cit> .

RESULTS
to characterize the general structural properties of phosphorylation sites  and to compare them to unphosphorylated sites , we first analyzed secondary structural assignments, relative side chain solvent accessibility, and the crystallographic b-factor as a measure of local structural rigidity. a statistically significant tendency for serine as well as tyrosine phosphorylation sites to be more exposed to the solvent was detected. threonine sites were also more exposed, albeit statistical significance could not be established . while these observations follow the intuitive expectation that phophate-group attachment sites should be more exposed, the magnitude of the difference appears surprisingly low . however, one has to bear in mind that serine, threonine, and tyrosine – polar amino acids themselves – have an innate tendency to be exposed to water. the distributions of crystallographic b-factors of phos-sites in comparison to non-phos sites were also observed to differ . phos-sites were more often found associated with the largest b-factor , i.e. regions of greater structural flexibility, albeit significant p-values of differences were only observed for serine sites . phosphorylated serines and threonines are more frequently found in random coil regions and less in α-helical or β-strand regions than their unphosphorylated counter-parts . for tyrosine, no such preferences for secondary structural type were detectable, except for a marginally increased frequency of phosphorylated sites to occur more often in turns.

characterization of the spatial environment of phosphorylation sites
we determined the propensities for the different amino acid residue types to occur in the spatial vicinity of the phosphorylated serines, threonines, and tyrosines, both for the sequential neighborhood as well as for the spatial-environment. by separating the two, our goal was to identify possible 3d-signature motifs. in a third analysis, both contributions were combined to assess the relative contribution of the sequence and structural environment. as explained in the method section, across all phosphorylation sites, we calculated the propensity values as log-odds ratios of the relative occurrences of amino acid types within distances from  <dig> to  <dig> Å from central phosphorylated amino acid residue and display the results in radial-radial cumulative propensity plots  in which red-colored segments signify statistically significant enrichment relative to a reference set, and blue-colorings depletion.

when all serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites irrespective of their association with a particular kinase family were analyzed, both the sequence logos and the spatial profile of phosphorylated serines showed only very little information contents . only small differences relative to the reference set of un-phosphorylated sites were detectable as reflected by the only few colored segments in the rcp-plots indicating enrichment or depletion. for all three target amino acid types, most information appears to be contained in the local sequence and not in the spatial environment. by considering amino acids irrespective of their sequential proximity , essentially no significant differences to the reference set of un-phosphorylated sites were found. this agrees well with results reported by fan and zhang who characterized structural microenvironments of phosphorylation sites within  <dig> Å from the central residue only and observed no evidence for significant amino acid propensities to fall within radial distance of  <dig> Å  <cit> . interestingly, in the local sequence neighborhood, tyrosine residues – an amino acid that itself is target of phosphorylation events – appear to be depleted relative to the reference dataset in serine- and threonine-targeted phosphorylation sites. however, this depletion appears to be compensated by tyrosine residues found in the spatial environment such that overall , no significant depletion of tyrosine residues in the environment of serine- and threonine phosphorylation sites was detectable.

kinase-family specific phosphorylation motifs
for the set of serine protein kinase sequences whose target proteins were found by screening the protein structure databank ; i.e., the structure of the target proteins is known, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and computed the corresponding sequence logos of the targets associated with kinase group   <cit>  to obtain an overview and reference framework of the evolutionary relationships of the kinase sequences and their respective targets. for tyrosine and threonine kinases, respectively, such analysis was not possible  because of lack of annotated kinase-target pairs with known structure.  in agreement with results from previous studies, the sequence logos of serine kinase targets associated with the main serine-kinase families can be clustered into several groups  <cit> . evolutionarily close kinase-groups tend to also share common features in their respective targets. the major groups of targets are characterized by proline residues next to the central serine  or a glutamate , a second group with negatively charged sequences . the agc kinase-group as well as the camk kinase-group comprise kinases with positively charged targets.

these enrichments are well captured by the sequence logos and are also reflected in the rcp-plots for the spatial environment considering sequence-local residues. in addition to the detected enrichments , the rcp-plots also highlight significant depletions of amino acid types  that are not immediately apparent from the sequence logo plots alone.

in the following section, we investigate the targets associated with the main kinase families in greater detail. in particular, we are interested to uncover potential 3d-signature motifs beyond the established sequence motifs that can be revealed when investigating individual kinase families rather than across all sites. such motifs would become evident as colored segments found in the "non-sequence-local" graph, but not found in the "sequence-local" graph. we will refer to those motifs as 3d-signature motifs. naturally, we limited our analyses to kinase families with sufficient numbers of representatives with the smallest family being the mapk family with  <dig> members.

serine sites
the agc group
the agc family consists of kinases recognizing serine targets with an arginine or lysine residue at a distance of 2– <dig> residues relative to the central serine within the local protein sequence and includes the pka and pkc as well as grk, bark, mark, pkb, pkg, and rsk kinase families which are not included in the study of spatial motifs presented here for paucity of corresponding data. furthermore, the local sequence-based spatial profile is characterized by lower than expected occurrences of tryptophan and glutamate. interestingly, the elevated occurrences of the positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine – the hallmark for the agc kinase group – appears confined to the sequence-local neighborhood. an enrichment of arginine or lysine in the spatial context of pka was not detectable. in the structural neighborhood , the counts for both amino acids are not increased relative to the reference distribution. the pkc motifs exhibit an additional enrichment of serine in the sequence-local neighborhood, accompanied by a pronounced depletion of the amino acid residues histidine, glutamate, and tryptophan. the pka motifs were observed to be depleted of the amino acid cysteine. for both families, pka and pkc, a depletion of the hydrophobic amino acids alanine and leucine in the non-sequence-local neighborhood and an additional depletion of isoleucine in pka motifs was detected .

the cmgc group
proline residues flanking the phosphorylated serines are the hallmark sequence feature of targets associated with cmgc kinase group which includes the cdk, ckii kinase families  as well as mapk and cdc. the ckii and mapk were included in the spatial study as the number of structurally annotated targets was sufficient. the ckii family from the cmgc iv group, even though grouped into the cmgc group, does not follow the pro-next-to-ser rule. its location in the serine-kinase phylogenetic tree is near the branching point between the cmgc branch and atm family .

in the sequence-local environment of the mapk, no enrichments of amino acids besides proline were detectable. instead, depletions of eight amino acid types, glutamine, asparagine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, valine as well as glycine, serine, and threonine were detected. in the non-sequence-local environment of target serines, serine, and histidine residues were observed to be overrepresented.

the active sites of ckii kinases are characterized by positively charged surfaces  <cit> . this positive charge density is mirrored by negatively charged aspartate and glutamate in the sequence-local and non-sequence-local spatial neighborhood. furthermore, the rcp-plots reveal enrichments of serine and histidine the sequence-local and proline in the non-sequence-local rcp pattern. a depletion of phenylalanine is observed at distances of  <dig> Å and greater for both patterns, while a depletion of threonine, asparagine and isoleucine is only detectable in the sequence-local spatial context.

tyrosine sites
the ptk group
the ptk group comprises tyrosine phosphorylating kinases and as such were not included in the introduced phylogenetic tree of serine targeting kinases. the sequence-local spatial context of src-kinase family  – for which sufficient data for analysis was available – is enriched in aspartate, proline, leucine, alanine, and tryptophan in the non-sequence-local spatial context. depletions of several amino acids were also detectable, most consistently cysteine .

in summary, all kinase-family specific rcp-plots reveal specific spatial profiles and more information contents than was detectable when sites were investigated across all kinase families . the profiles comprise signatures of sequential motifs and discern spatial preferences which cannot be identified by inspecting the local sequence alone. all profiles show significant patterns of enrichments as well as depletions of particular amino acid residue types within the spatial neighborhood of the phosphorylated target amino acid.

computational prediction of phosphorylation events using 3d-information
we now turn to investigating whether incorporating 3d structural information can be used to improve the sensitivity and specificity of phosphorylation site predictions in proteins.

comparative analysis of prediction performance, kinase-family-specific predictions
for the general, kinase-family unspecific prediction of phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine sites, the svm-predictors based on local sequence information alone that have been developed as part of this study were observed to perform at comparable or even slightly better performance levels compared to netphos and disphos, and consistently better compared to kinasephos as judged by the area under the receiver operating characteristic  from 10-fold cross-validation test .

results from the cross-validation of the various prediction approaches. the sequence-only and spatial-information enriched methods were developed as part of this study and compared to netphos  <dig> b that includes the kinase-specific predictor netphos/k, disphos <dig>  and kinasephos <dig> . as kinasephos reports only decision values of positively predicted sites, the evaluation of kinase specific prediction was not possible due to missing score values for sites not predicted to be phosphorylated. however, the kinase-specific predictions were feasible as kinasephos essentially reports all submitted sites as being phosphorylated by at least one kinase. for the evaluation of the predictor, the highest reported decision value was used for each site. best performing methods are printed in bold-face.

similarly, for the kinase-family specific predictions, the auc-based performance of netphos and our svm-based method was comparable or even in favor of our svm  giving us an appropriate best possible sequence-information-alone baseline to assess the effect of adding 3d-structural information on the prediction accuracy when added to the svm.

while the magnitude of performance gain when including 3d-profile information was relatively small compared to the estimated standard error, for all target sites and across all kinase-families and target residue types, a consistent increase in performance was obtained suggesting that including three-dimensional structural information does indeed improve the sensitivity and specificity of phosphorylation site prediction.

similar conclusions can be drawn from comparing prediction accuracies as well as sensitivities and specificities associated with the predictions rather than aucs  alone. unlike in the case of auc, where it was impossible to compute auc values for the kinasephos  <dig>  prediction program because of non-returned score values, here it was possible to obtain relevant values also for the kinasephos  <dig>  prediction program. again, adding 3d-information to using only sequence information resulted in modest , yet consistently improved predictions for all three target amino acid types as well as kinase-family specific targets such that best prediction results were always obtained by using our 3d-information enriched svm-based prediction method with the exception of the kinase families pkc and mapk for which the performance was virtually identical compared to our sequence-only svm, but still better than the other prediction programs included in this study. the most significant gain was obtained for serines sites followed by tyrosine and threonine sites.

discussion
in this work, we focused on the characterization and prediction of phosphorylation sites. serine is the most frequent target amino acid residue type for phosphorylation followed by threonine and tyrosine. we pursued two major themes: the analysis phosphorylation in a kinase family specific fashion, and to investigate whether phosphorylation sites are characterized by specific three-dimensional  structural motifs or epitopes constituted by amino acid residues that are not necessarily close in sequence, thereby providing additional information that can help in predicting phosphorylation sites for proteins with known structure or with available structural models. we used the simple radial distance to define structural motifs. ideally, angular information would be included as well. however, much larger datasets of determined structures would be necessary to derive reliable statistical data for more refined approaches. even by applying only this simple model, we observed that 3d-structural context information is indeed discernable, even though the most information contents appears to reside primarily in the local sequence, as judged by the sequence-local kinase unspecific rcp-plots and the modest increased performance when adding spatial-information to sequence-only based predictors. the most pronounced improvement of prediction of phosphorylation sites by augmenting sequence-only prediction by spatial information was obtained for targets of serine kinases. however, also for the prediction of threonine and tyrosine targets, a performance gain was obtained when adding 3d information.

as several experimental techniques have been established to detect proteins that specifically bind to phosphorylated sites based on immobilized peptides ; i.e., the binding epitope is reconstituted from the sequence-local amino acid residues alone, the results obtained in this study lend further support to such approaches. based on the findings obtained for our dataset, spatial information is discernable, but may not be absolutely critical to define the binding epitope, although conclusively proving it will require experimental comparisons of binding efficiencies for known interacting partners based on the complete and natively folded as well as local peptide sequence.

it has been reported that phosphorylation is preferentially occurring in unstructured; i.e., flexible regions of proteins  <cit> . these conclusions resulted from sequence-based predictions of the flexibility of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated sites and are also supported by the reasonable prediction performance by disphos <dig>  for serine and threonine. the prediction of phosphorylation sites by disphos is based on a prior predication of local flexibility. however, many phosphorylation sites were found in regions of clearly defined secondary structures . we further investigated this by comparing the crystallographic b-factor as well as secondary structural class for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated serine sites . in the latter, loop regions may represent rather unstructured segments, even though it does not mean that this regions are structurally flexible. flexibility may be better captured by the reported b-factor. we found statistically significant differences of b-factors for phosphorylated compared to non-phosphorylated serine sites detectable, albeit the differences were not that large. of course, we only included those proteins in our investigation with an available crystallographic structure; including atomic coordinate information for the targeted peptide segment itself. it may be possible that, by only using fully resolved structures that we needed in order to detect possible 3d-motifs, we excluded phosphorylation events in unstructured regions right from the start. indeed, 86% of removed motifs  were localized in loops as judged by prediction by disembl  <dig>   <cit> . within the training dataset only 66% of phos-sites  and 53% of non-phos sites  were predicted in loops . moreover, 3% of phosphorylated residues were found near the protein sequence termini where the structural flexibility naturally increases, which were not considered as potential target sites. follow-up studies need to be performed to address this question more systematically by mapping sites that were found in peptide-based methods  and to map them to available protein structures and to gather statistics how often phosphorylation sites map to regions that cannot be resolved crystallographically.

predicted ratios of sites in loop regions as judged by prediction by disembl  <dig>   <cit> . percent of sites in loop regions according to the annotation of secondary structure of b, c, s, and t by dssp is given in brackets.

gnad and co-workers, the authors of the phosida database, evaluated the preferences of secondary structure, accessibility of phosphorylated residues and the conservation rate of phosphorylation sites  <cit> . the preferences of secondary structure and accessibility were estimated by prediction. consistent with our results, they found small, yet statistically significant differences between the phos-site and non-phosite for serine, threonine, and tyrosine motifs. furthermore, they were able to improve the performance of prediction by applying the predicted values to prediction. although the average predicted accessibility differed from our results, the tendencies were comparable. the computed average accessibilities in the phosida-approach were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for phos and non-phos serines,  <dig> / <dig> for threonines and  <dig> / <dig>  for tyrosines, respectively. in our approach the accessibilities and the secondary structure preferences were determined based on fully resolved protein structures. for pdbfinder-based accessibility values, we determined  <dig> / <dig>  for serines,  <dig> / <dig>  for threonines and  <dig> / <dig>  for tyrosines, respectively. furthermore, gnad et al. predicted 93% of phosphorylated serines and 78% of non-phosphorylated serines to occur in loops and hinge regions. for threonines, the corresponding frequencies were determined as 90% and 70%, and for tyrosine 79% and 48%, respectively. in our approach, we found significant differences of secondary structural preferences between phos and non phos-sites. in addition, the determined frequencies of sites in rigid regions  were much higher. however, including accessibility and the secondary structure information did not yield any improvements of the prediction, probably because both these properties were implicitly covered by the amino acid properties already.

a major problem in any effort to develop a computational predictor arises from the difficulty to define a reliable true-negative set; i.e., sites that are truly unphosphorylated. as phosphorylation is condition-dependent, experimental screens may well be incomplete as it is impossible to explore all environmental conditions under which phosphorylation events may occur. even sites that are buried and inaccessible for phosphorylating kinases in one protein state may become exposed upon conformational changes and become phosphorylated  <cit> . thus, even buried sites cannot be ruled out as candidate phosphorylation sites. even more so, the numerical value for solvent accessibility may oftentimes suggest that a serine is buried, even though it is actually a surface residue, but occluded by neighboring side chains and not buried deep in the protein's core. the assumption that buried amino acids cannot become phosphorylated and using it as criterion for the construction of a negative set may, in fact, be misleading. the resulting predictors will tend to predict accessibility of target sites rather than the possibility of phosphorylation. an alternative way for defining negative sets is including of all candidate sites  except experimentally verified phosphorylation sites with the reasoning that such a true-negative set will at least be depleted in true-positive sites. in this study, we followed this approach, realizing that this may represent a source of error.

an estimated two to five percent of eukaryotic genomes codes for kinase genes grouped into different kinase families  <cit>  and 30% of all proteins are estimated to be phosphorylated as judged by proteomics screens  <cit> . mirroring the many different kinases catalyzing the addition of phosphate group to proteins, the high diversity of their cognate phosphorylation target sites is a major obstacle for a reliable prediction of phosphorylation. in addition, experimental evidence suggests that the kinases are to some degree unspecific and are capable of phosphorylating a wide spectrum of substrates  <cit> . on the other hand, evidence for sequence-encoded specificity on the side of phosphorylation target has also been presented. for example, the prediction accuracy of phosphorylation sites in plant proteins was shown to increase substantially when the computational methods were trained on plant proteins versus methods trained primarily on animal proteins suggesting kingdom specific differences of phosphorylation target sites  <cit> .

the high diversity of targets of particular kinases and the number of possible phosphorylated proteins accompanied with the pleiotropicity of kinases appear to contradict a specific regulatory role of phosphorylation. however, the specificity for the actual target site may not be the only source of kinase specificity and sensitivity of the regulatory system. in fact, it was shown that subcellular compartmentation accompanied with recognition of secondary target sites relatively distant to the catalytic domains is crucial for further selectivity and specificity. while 3d motifs near the actual target site for phosphorylation have been at the center of our investigations, for the kinase family cdk, in particular the kinase cdk <dig>  <cit> , it has been reported that secondary sites, protein surface site distant from the actual phosphorylation site may determine binding specificity of kinases with their target protein. therefore, the systematic identification and characterization of such secondary recognition sites appears worthwhile  <cit> . kinase activation in kinase cascades by post translational modification, formation of protein complexes as well as priming of phosphorylation further enhance the sensitivity of the phosphorylation system  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the reliable prediction of phosphorylation sites and the identification of associated kinase enzymes are important steps that will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of complex signaling events in cellular systems. applying a simple radial distance model for the characterization of the 3d-structural context of phosphorylation sites, it is possible to extract kinase specific signature 3d-profiles. while local one-dimensional amino acid sequence information was observed to harbor most of the discriminatory power, spatial context information was identified as relevant for the recognition of kinases and their cognate target sites and can be used for an improved prediction of phosphorylation sites. a web-based service  implementing the developed structure-based p-site prediction method has been made available at .
