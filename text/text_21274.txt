BACKGROUND
microcystins are a family of cyclic heptapeptides consisting of seven characteristic amino acids . exposure to microcystins poses a severe health risk for both humans and animals, primarily because of hepatotoxicity. accidental ingestion of water contaminated with microcystins causes acute hepatitis due to the inhibition of protein phosphatase  <dig>  and pp2a in hepatocytes, and the possible involvement of microcystins in tumor promotion has also been suggested  <cit> . although a number of cyanobacterial genera  are known to produce microcystins, the primary producer of microcystins is the water-bloom-forming cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa that is often found in eutrophic freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and reservoirs worldwide.

more than  <dig> structural variants of microcystin with varying levels of toxicity have been reported  <cit> . most of these variants differ from each other at the second  and/or fourth  amino acid position in the cyclic heptapeptide. another form of variant in which one or two amino acids are demethylated is also often encountered . many strains of m. aeruginosa are known to produce more than two variants of microcystins  <cit> . a single microcystin synthetase  gene cluster  has been shown to be responsible for all structural variants of microcystins  <cit> . the product of the mcy gene cluster is a large multienzyme complex of mixed polyketide synthase  and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  modules.

the mcy gene cluster of m. aeruginosa comprises  <dig> genes, mcya to mcyj, nine of which encode catalytic domains for microcystin synthesis  <cit> . by contrast, the product of mcyh is hypothesized to be involved in intra-  cellular transportation of microcystins  <cit> . as in other nrpss, the products of the mcy gene cluster possess the same number of basic "modules" as the number of amino acids incorporated into the non-ribosomal peptide, synthesizing microcystins by a thiotemplate mechanism  <cit> . each nrps module contains an adenylation domain , a domain for specific amino acid activation, a condensation domain , a domain for specific amino acid recognition and peptide bond elongation, and a peptidyl carrier protein . similarly, the pks-coding components of the mcy gene cluster contain genes encoding type i pks modules consisting of a β-ketoacyl synthase , an acyltransferase , β-ketoacyl reductase , a dehydratase , and an acyl carrier protein . other optional domains for tailoring enzymes are also present in the mcy gene cluster.

given that only a single mcy gene cluster is present in the genome of strains producing two or more variants of microcystins  <cit> , it has been suggested that the structural variation of microcystins differing in amino acid composition is due to nonspecific amino acid recognition by a domains encoded by the mcy genes rather than differences in the primary structures of mcy  <cit> . because the two nrps modules encoded by the first part of mcyb  and mcyc are responsible for the variable amino acids in microcystins , most previous work investigating the genetic diversity of mcy has focused on these two genes  <cit> . interestingly, it has been demonstrated that gene conversion between a domains, but not c domains, encoded by mcyb <dig> and mcyc, can explain the difference in the production of specific microcystin variants in a number of strains  <cit> . positive selection at the codon near the binding pocket of the a domain might have an impact on the genetic diversity of mcyc  <cit> . these results suggest that variation of microcystin composition might be genetically structured to some extent. an important finding has been the recombinational replacement of a domains encoded by mcyb <dig> with domains from phylogenetically distant origins, probably occurring as a result of horizontal transmission  <cit> . this finding questions the validity of using a domains, or other redundant domains of pks and nrps, to investigate the overall phylogenetic relationships of the mcy gene cluster. moreover, it has also been demonstrated that both intra- and intergenic recombination significantly contributes to the overall genetic diversity of the mcy genes  <cit> . recent occurrences of recombination can significantly bias the result of phylogenetic analysis because they decouple genetic similarity from evolutionary history. therefore, multiple and conservative regions of the mcy locus should be used as genetic markers to understand better the evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity of the mcy genes as a whole.

previously we demonstrated that toxic strains are divided into two lineages, group a and group b, based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the seven housekeeping genes   <cit> . this finding raises the following two questions: 1) are mcy genes structured similarly to the housekeeping genes? or did they evolve independently from the other genes in the genome of m. aeruginosa? 2) which evolutionary forces are responsible for the observed genetic divergence of the mcy genes?  to address these issues, we have analyzed the mcy genes from  <dig> toxic and non-toxic strains of m. aeruginosa.

we performed a suite of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of the mcy genes using three "conservative" loci within the mcy gene cluster as markers . mlst is a multilocus sequence-based genotyping protocol that has been widely used to investigate the population structures of a broad spectrum of microbial species ranging from bacteria and archaea to eukaryotic microbes  <cit> . a conventional mlst analysis based on the seven housekeeping loci  <cit>  was also performed to compare it with the results of the mcymlst analysis. we measured the microcystin composition of each strain to investigate the possible correlation between mcy genetic divergence and microcystin composition. our results show how evolutionary forces, particularly recombination and genetic drift, have contributed to the genetic divergence of mcy genes.

methods
strains, culture, isolation and dna extraction
the  <dig> strains of m. aeruginosa used in this study are listed in additional file  <dig>  they include  <dig> toxic strains that we previously characterized using mcya, mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj  <cit> ,  <dig> mcyg-positive and  <dig> mcyg-negative strains used in our previous report  <cit> , and  <dig> toxic strains recently isolated in 2004– <dig>  the novel  <dig> strains were isolated by the following protocol. colonies of m. aeruginosa were picked from field water samples by using a glass micropipette under a microscope, and cultured in a 1: <dig> mixture of liquid ma medium  <cit>  and autoclaved field water filtrated using a nylon net filter with  <dig>  μm pore size . from these "crude" cultures, a single cell was picked to establish a clonal strain by the same micromanipulation procedure used in crude isolation except that ma medium was used for clonal cultures. of the  <dig> strains,  <dig> are currently available at mcc-nies  and the  <dig> newly isolated strains will be available at mcc-nies in the future. cultures were grown in  <dig> ml of ma medium at 25°c for 1– <dig> weeks under a 12: <dig> l/d cycle with a photon density of  <dig> μmol m-2s- <dig>  genomic dna was extracted and purified by a fastdna® kit .

multilocus sequencing typing  of seven housekeeping genes
the published mlst protocol for m. aeruginosa  <cit>  was employed to genetically characterize the newly isolated strains. amplified pcr fragments were purified by exosap-it  and were sequenced in both directions by a dtcs quick start kit and a ceq <dig> autosequencer . following the standard procedure of mlst, each different allele for each locus is assigned a different arbitrary number, and the unique combination of seven allele numbers  unambiguously defines a strain's sequence type . the mlst sequence data of the  <dig> strains that we previously characterized  <cit>  are available at the ddbj database . newly determined mlst sequence data have been deposited in the ddbj database .

mcy multilocus sequencing typing 
three loci, mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj, encoding parts of the dh domain , the a domain , and o-methyltransferase , respectively, were selected for the multilocus mcy gene sequence typing . each locus is expected to be ca.  <dig> bps in length. note that these three loci were selected on the basis of three criteria: 1) the domains encoded by these loci are not directly involved in the structural variation of microcystins ; 2) the sequences of these loci have diverged sufficiently from other regions of the mcy gene cluster to exclude the possible misamplification of similar but different domains by pcr; 3) there is no evidence that these loci have been replaced with the genes of phylogenetically distant organisms through horizontal transmission . each locus was pcr-amplified using published primers  and optimal reaction conditions  <cit> . purification and sequencing reactions of the amplified pcr fragments were performed according to the protocol described above for mlst. as in mlst, each different allele for each mcymlst locus was assigned a different arbitrary number, thereby creating an "allelic profile" that unambiguously defined a strain's "mcyst" . sequence data of  <dig> strains that we previously characterized are available at the ddbj database . newly determined sequence data have been deposited in the ddbj database .

phylogenetic analysis
for phylogenetic analysis, the most appropriate models of the dna sequence evolution of each mcymlst locus were selected by a hierarchical likelihood ratio test  using modeltest version  <dig>   <cit> . using paup* version  <dig> b <dig>  <cit> , neighbor-joining  phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of the maximum-likelihood  distance calculated from the inferred model and parameters. nj bootstrap  analyses were also performed to assess the statistical confidence of nodes on the basis of alignments generated by  <dig>  resamplings of the data with the same dna substitution models used for phylogenetic reconstruction. bayesian ml phylogenetic reconstruction was performed with mr. bayes version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . using the dna evolution model chosen by modeltest and the nj tree as a starting tree, two independent runs were performed, each with four chains for  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig> generations , in which trees were sampled every  <dig> generations. statistical confidence for branch support was assessed by posterior probability  estimated from the 50% majority consensus tree after discarding the burn-in phase of  <dig> ,000– <dig> , <dig> generations . phylogenetic analysis of the seven housekeeping genes was performed in the same way as that for mcy genes, except that the seven genes were concatenated prior to analysis, and each run was performed for  <dig> , <dig> generations in bayesian phylogenetic inference .

using clonalframe version  <dig>   <cit> , multilocus genealogies and a suite of population genetic parameters to account for the given mcy data were inferred. the 50% majority consensus genealogy was generated from the posterior samples of the last  <dig>  generations at a thinning interval of  <dig> after discarding the burn-in phase of first  <dig>  generations.

population genetic analysis
estimates of the parameters for dna sequence divergence, gene diversity h =   , nucleotide diversity π  <cit> , and a test for neutrality by tajima's d  <cit>  were performed with dnasp version  <dig>   <cit> . coalescent-based estimates of the population recombination rate  and population mutation rate , minimum numbers of recombination , and statistical probabilities of likelihood permutation test  were calculated by ldhat version  <dig>   <cit> . multilocus linkage disequilibrium was assessed by the standardized index of association  using the program start version  <dig>  <cit> . ias is a standardized measure of ia  <cit> , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the statistical significance of non-zero values of ias was inferred on the basis of a comparison of those values estimated from  <dig>  randomized datasets under a null hypothesis of panmixia. the phi -test  was performed with splitstree version  <dig>   <cit> . maximum likelihood-based tests for phylogenetic congruence between loci  <cit>  were performed with paup*. analysis of molecular variance  was performed with arlequin version  <dig>   <cit> . the mcdonald-kreitman test  <cit>  was performed with dnasp. paml version  <dig>   <cit>  was used to search for sites under positive selection. possible positively selected sites were also investigated on the basis of  <dig> physicochemical criteria with treesaap version  <dig>   <cit> , following the standard protocol except that the statistical significance level was set to  <dig>  .

microcystin analysis
to a 10-ml culture of each m. aeruginosa strain,  <dig>  ml of acetic acid was added and the mixture was ultrasonicated for  <dig> minutes. after centrifugation , the supernatant was collected and the remnant pellet was further extracted with  <dig>  ml of methyl alcohol by the same procedure as the initial extraction. to the combined supernatant, distilled water was added to  <dig> ml. the diluted extract was passed through a conditioned  inertsep rp- <dig> cartridge . the cartridge was washed with 20% methanol aqueous solution, and then eluted with  <dig>  ml of 80% methanol aqueous solution. the eluate was diluted with  <dig>  ml of distilled water, and applied to high-performance liquid chromatography  using an lc-10a system . microcystin variants were identified in comparison with authentic samples in the case of microcystins -lr, -yr, and -rr. other microcystin variants were identified by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  using an lcms-2010a system .

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the seven housekeeping genes
the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the seven housekeeping  loci is shown in fig.  <dig>  overall, the results were consistent with those of our previous study  <cit> . the most toxic strains fell into two lineages, termed group a and group b. the statistical support for group a was weak, whereas that for group b was moderate to strong. in group a, all but one strain represented by st <dig> were toxic , whereas toxic and non-toxic strains coexisted in group b. three toxic strains represented by st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> belonged to neither group a nor group b, forming a distinct monophyletic lineage . the location of st <dig> was ambiguous and varied according to the phylogenetic method used, a feature that was also encountered in our previous study  <cit> . three distinct non-toxic clades  were again recovered in this phylogenetic analysis.

mcy multilocus sequence typing 
the results of the mcymlst analysis are shown in additional file  <dig>  all sets of primers successfully recovered the three mcy loci from all toxic and mcyg-positive isolates included in this study. by contrast, the primer sets for mcyd and mcyj failed to amplify these genes from any of the mcyg-negative strains that we identified in our previous study  <cit> . the amplified loci of mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp, respectively, in length. neither insertions nor deletions were found within the sequences of mcyg and mcyj, whereas an insertion of  <dig> bp was found within one mcyd genotype  representing five strains. all sequences could be unambiguously aligned . for the  <dig> mcy-positive isolates,  <dig> mcy sequence types  were found. the number of alleles of mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

phylogenetic analysis of mcy
the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the individual mcy loci is shown in fig.  <dig>  in all of the three mcy phylogenetic trees, m. aeruginosa strains could be separated into two clades, group a and group b, consistent with the same grouping as in the mlst phylogeny . this dichotomy was most robustly supported in the phylogenetic tree of mcyg , whereas it was moderately supported in the mcyd and mcyj phylogenies. four mcysts  showed discordant placements between the two groups  depending on the loci used. for example, mcyst <dig> was located within group a by mcyd and mcyg analysis, but within group b by mcyj analysis. such discordance is highly likely to be due to recombination between loci. therefore we next employed clonalframe, a multilocus phylogenetic reconstruction method that takes into account the effect of recombination between and within loci. the results of clonalframe, which showed the highest likelihood value of  <dig> independent mcmc runs, are illustrated in fig. 4a. again, two highly supported clades  were recovered. four anomalous mcysts  identified in the individual mcy phylogenies branched at the midpoint of groups a and b. within-group relationships were still poorly resolved, as in the analyses of individual loci.

genetic diversity and recombination
because two distinct groups were identified in the mcy phylogenetic and genealogical analyses, genetic diversity indices were estimated from all of the mcy data and also from subsets of data  . the maximum sequence divergence of mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj in the whole dataset was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, that in group a was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, and that in group b was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. for mcyd, the genetic diversity differed between groups, being much higher in group a  than in group b . for mcyg and mcyj, the genetic diversity indices were similar between the groups.

two statistical tests, the likelihood permutation test  and phi  test were performed to explore recombination within loci . all tests for intragenic recombination within group a were significant except for one case , whereas recombination within group b was not significant in any tests except for the lpt of mcyd. consistent with these results, the minimum number of recombination  was larger in group a than in group b, and mcyd and mcyg of group b showed no evidence of recombination . coalescent-based parameter estimates indicated that the population recombination rates  were generally larger than population mutation rates . once again, ρ values for mcyd and mcyg were higher in group a than in group b, but similar between the groups for mcyj. on the other hand, statistical tests using the standardized index of association  for all samples, group a, and group b gave significant positive values  . however, ias using only unique sts gave significant positive values for the whole dataset and group a , whereas the ias of group b was not significantly different from zero . maximum likelihood-based tests for phylogenetic congruence demonstrated  that significant congruence  between the mcy ml trees and randomized trees was present for the whole dataset and group a, but not for group b, indicating that recombination is much more frequent in group b. overall, the results were consistent but gave different effects of recombination between groups; that is, intralocus recombination is frequent within group a but rare within group b, whereas interlocus recombination is frequent within group b but not within group a. interestingly, the mutation-scaled recombination rate  of mcyg was  <dig> times larger for group a than for the whole dataset . recombination at a specific branch in the phylogenetic tree can be detected by the program clonalframe. for example, our analysis indicated that small segments of mcyd and mcyj are likely to have undergone recombination at the branch of the group a-b boundary .

test for selection
the inferred parameter values indicative of selection and the results of tests for selection are shown in table  <dig>  the ratio of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site  to synonymous changes per synonymous site  may provide a good measure of adaptive evolution on a given locus because an excess of dn over ds  is expected under adaptive evolution. however, the dn/ds values of mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, values that are all much smaller than  <dig>  indicating that purifying selection rather than positive selection is responsible for the genetic diversity of the mcy genes.

 <dig> number of codons under positive selection changed on the branch of the group a-b boundary according to treesaap.

next, we performed several statistical tests to investigate further the presence of selection acting on mcy genes. the tajima's d statistic indicates selection when it significantly differs from the neutral expectation of d =  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  the tajima's d value for each mcy locus did not significantly differ from zero for the whole dataset or group a or b . to investigate whether selection was responsible for the deep divergence of mcy into groups a and b, we performed the mcdonald-kreitman  test, which compares the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous polymorphism within groups and that of synonymous to non-synonymous divergence  between groups; these two ratios should be equal under the null hypothesis of neutrality  <cit> . again, none of the mk test p values was significant , and thus did not provide evidence for selection on the branch of the group a-b boundary.

all of the above analyses are based on the average nucleotide polymorphism; however, these kinds of test are not sensitive enough to detect a single or small number of adaptive amino acid changes, which are sometimes responsible for improved fitness of a given gene. two programs, paml and treesaap, were therefore used to overcome this problem. the first program paml uses the same approach as the dn/ds consideration but applies it to individual sites on the basis of maximum-likelihood, thus enabling codons under positive selection to be detected. using paml, we employed the "site models", and performed two likelihood-ratio tests, a test of m1a  versus m2a , and that of m <dig>  versus m <dig>  to determine any sites under positive selection , as suggested by the author  <cit> . significant likelihood ratio values were obtained for mcyg and mcyj , but not for mcyd . for each locus , two codons were identified as positively selected sites by the model that showed the highest log-likelihood . although the number was small , the most likely positively selected sites were substituted on the branch bordering groups a and b.

the second program, treesaap, provides a method to detect an adaptive amino acid change by taking quantitative amino acid properties into account. on the basis of statistical tests for differences in the observed versus the expected change under neutrality in the eight categories of  <dig> physicochemical criteria , treesaap identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sites under positive selection in mcyd, mcyg, and mcyj, respectively; these numbers of sites were much larger than those identified by paml. treesaap also identified all of the positively selected sites identified by paml, including the sites at the branch of the a-b boundary. unlike the result of paml analyses, the most likely positively selected sites identified in mcyd and mcyj did not change on the branch bordering groups a and b, whereas half of the selected sites in mcyg were identified to have been substituted on the branch of the a-b boundary.

genetic differentiation
to investigate the significance of geographic isolation on the genetic diversity of the mcy genes, our strains were partitioned into their geographic origins. because the inclusion of localities with a small number of strains may bias the result of amova, we included only strains for which more than five isolates were available from a single locality. on the basis of this criterion, nine groups of strains from lake barato , lake inba , lake kasumigaura , lake okutama , lake suwa , lake teganuma , ishigaki dam  and kunnma dam  were selected and analyzed. the results of amova  indicated low but significant genetic structuring among local populations , although the within-population genetic variance was still high.

microcystin analysis
most strains were found to produce multiple variants of microcystins . on the basis of the microcystin composition, our strains were divided into eight categories . several isolates were found to produce other microcystin variants at a low concentration . we did not include them here, because such minor variants are highly likely to have been produced through the occasional misrecognition of amino acids by the substrate-binding pocket of the a domain and therefore would appear to be not selectively important.

the most dominant form of microcystin was microcystin-lr and -rr, representing 56% of the total  <dig> mcy-positive isolates. the second most dominant form was microcystin-lr, -rr, and -yr, which accounted for 22% of the  <dig> strains. in general, group b appeared to be more divergent in microcystin composition as compared with group a. for example, demethylated microcystin variants  were exclusively present in strains assigned to group b , although genotypic relationships among the different variants were poorly resolved. indeed, the difference in microcystin composition between group a and group b was significant . some strains with the same mcyst were found to produce a different combination of microcystin variants . once again, it should be noted here that five mcy-positive isolates did not produce a detectable level of microcystins  <cit>  .

discussion
phylogenetic analysis based on the seven housekeeping loci  indicated that toxic strains are affiliated into two major clades, group a and group b, and an outlier clade group "x" . this observed subgrouping of toxic strains is largely consistent with our previous mlst phylogeny  <cit> , suggesting that the ability to produce microcystins is genetically structured to some extent. on the other hand, our phylogenetic and multilocus genealogical analyses of the mcymlst divided our strains into two clades . importantly, these two clades correspond to groups a and b in the mlst phylogeny. the congruent phylogenies between the mcy  and housekeeping genes  of several microcystin-producing cyanobacterial genera have been demonstrated and suggested to be evidence for the vertical rather than interspecific horizontal transmission of mcy genes  <cit> . the overall concordance of group assignment between the mcy and mlst phylogenies in this study suggests that horizontal transmission of mcy between distantly related microcystis strains is also not so frequent. interestingly however, strains included in group "x" and st <dig>  in group a show discordant phylogenetic placements between groups a and b in the mcy phylogeny depending on the mcy loci used, suggesting that these strains represent the consequence of intergroup horizontal transmissions of mcy genes followed by recombination.

our population genetic data corroborate our previous finding that recombination is an important force in maintaining the genetic diversity of the mcy genes  <cit> . moreover, population recombination rates were larger than mutation rates in general , suggesting that recombination is more frequent than point mutation within the mcy genes. although our data may not be robust owing to the small sample sizes, the relative contribution of recombination and point mutation to the genetic diversity of the mcy genes may be comparable to that of various genes of other highly recombinogenic bacteria, such as helicobacter pylori and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . clonalframe assumes that recombined fragments  differ from the parental segments  at a constant percentage of ν, which can be used to roughly infer the origin of recombined fragments  <cit> . our estimate of ν of mcy is  <dig> , which is lower than the maximum sequence divergence  of mcy genes. this result suggests that most recombined segments originated from within m. aeruginosa. clonalframe also estimated the mean length of recombined segments as  <dig> bp, which is in line with a previous study showing that bacterial recombination can occur within a very short length of dna   <cit> . the very small size of the imported segments implies that they are subject to various restriction systems  <cit>  discovered within the genome of m. aeruginosa  <cit> .

within clades, recombination was suggested to be frequent, although the effect of recombination appeared to differ between groups and loci. for example, interlocus recombination in group b was so frequent that alleles at different mcy loci were assorted randomly , whereas the clonal divergence of mcy genes was suggested in group a . when we examined intralocus recombination, however, most significant recombination was found for group a, with little recombination for group b . the different impact of recombination between two clades might be due to the different forms of genetic exchange and restriction system, because the length of recombined segments is known to be highly dependent on these mechanisms  <cit> .

importantly, statistical tests indicated that recombination seems to be more substantial within groups than between , implying that there is genetic isolation between groups a and b owing to dna sequence divergence. this result suggests that homology-dependent recombination makes a significant contribution to the strong genetic clustering of mcy genes. in this context, each mcy group may be recognized as a fuzzy analog of "biological species" in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . accordingly, strains belonging to group "x" might represent "hybrids" that could successfully cross over the genetic barrier between the two groups a and b. bacterial recombination is often mediated by vectors . some cyanophages that are infectious to microcystis have been suggested to have a very narrow host range  <cit> . such vector specificity might play a role in augmenting the genetic isolation between the two mcy clades. finally, the hypothesis that recombination might also play an important role in the diversification of mcy genes should not be dismissed. as shown in fig. 4b, significant recombination is likely to have occurred on the branch bordering groups a and b.

our data suggest that selection has not been an important factor in the genetic divergence of the mcy genes. none of tajima's d-values was significantly different from the neutral assumption, and the mk test failed to reject the neutral divergence of mcy into the two groups a and b. in addition, the paml and treesaap analyses identified few positively selected sites within the mcy genes on the branch separating groups a and b. one exception was the treesaap analysis of mcyg, which identified seven possible sites under positive selection on the branch of the group a-b boundary. the product of mcyg is probably involved in polyketide chain elongation within the adda of microcystins  <cit> . all microcystin variants identified in this study share the same adda at the corresponding position of the microcystin , and therefore positive selection at these sites, if present, appears to have little significance with regard to microcystin structure. it is possible that the observed deep divergence of mcyg arose as a result of selection at different but linked mcy genes. if so, it would be expected that these two clades would differ in microcystin composition, which might be thought to confer selective advantages under different  ecological conditions. however, analysis of microcystin composition did not support this hypothesis. although demethylated types of structural microcystin variants are exclusively present in strains in group b , the most frequently found microcystin compositions  are present in both groups , suggesting that mcy genealogy is decoupled from microcystin variation. similar results have been obtained for the freshwater cyanobacterium planktothrix, in which discordance between the genetic relationships and compositional trends of nonribosomal peptides is encountered  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that positive selection at the amino acid site neighboring the binding pocket of the a domain of mcyb in microcystis does not contribute to the production of specific microcystin variants  <cit> . unfortunately, the biological role of microcystins has yet to be determined, although several possible functions have been proposed  <cit> . clarifying the function of microcystins will be critical to evaluate further the importance of selection on the mcy genes.

as described above, strains affiliated to groups a and b in the mlst phylogeny  are generally clustered in the same groups in the mcy phylogeny . we previously suggested that the intraspecies clades found in the mlst phylogeny might represent "ecotypes"  <cit> . in this context, it is possible that selective sweeps on linked loci outside the mcy genes yielded the structured mcy phylogeny . for m. aeruginosa, several morphological  and physiological  variations are known. as shown in other cyanobacteria  <cit> , positive selection may favor these characteristics, but none of them is specific to either of the two groups  in m. aeruginosa . of course, investigation of previously uncharacterized ecological parameters are needed to rule out the possibility of mcy divergence due to a hitchhiking effect. in any event, selection acting on the mcy genes has little impact on their deep divergence with regard to the variation of microcystin composition.

genetic clustering can arise in the absence of selection where gene flow among populations is restricted due to a geographic barrier. although a few exceptions are known  <cit> , this possibility has been considered unlikely for microbes including m. aeruginosa for which long-distance dispersal may be easy owing to their small cell size and immense population size  <cit> . in fact, m. aeruginosa strains belonging to different groups in the mcy phylogenies are often isolated from a small amount of water sampled from one location at one time , suggesting that allopatry is not an important factor in the genetic isolation observed between the two mcy groups. consistent with this observation, the results of our amova found little geographic contribution to the pattern of genetic variation within the mcy genes .

despite the absence of geographic isolation and selection, we have identified two distinct mcy clusters for which recombination is much more frequent within than between. these results suggest that recombination and neutral genetic drift are primarily responsible for the observed deep divergence of the mcy genes in m. aeruginosa. this pattern of bacterial genetic divergence is in line with recent theoretical results indicating that genotypic clusters can arise and be maintained in the absence of selection or physical isolation when the recombination rate is a negative log-linear function of genetic distance  <cit>  and the effective population size  is extremely large  <cit> . although the ne of a bacterial population is difficult to appreciate and would be at least much lower than the census population size  <cit> , m. aeruginosa often forms a bloom with extremely large numbers of cells  with a high level of neutral genetic diversity  <cit> , and is thus likely to fulfill the latter condition  <cit> . recently, neutral molecular evolution in the natural bacterial population has received more attention than previously, and indeed potential evidence for it has been reported  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of multiple conservative loci within the microcystin synthetase  gene cluster suggested that mcy genes of m. aeruginosa are subdivided into two cryptic clades, which have been primarily generated and maintained as a result of homology-dependent recombination and neutral genetic drift.
