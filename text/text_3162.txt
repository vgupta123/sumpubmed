BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , the causative agent of prrs in swine, is a member of the arteriviridae family in the order nidovirales. prrsv causes highly significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide  <cit>  as a result of both reproductive failure  in pregnant sows and respiratory disease  in nursery and grower/finishing pigs  <cit> . infection with prrsv also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens  <cit> , as such, prrsv is a key etiological agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex . clinical disease caused by prrsv is highly variable, ranging from mild, subclinical infection to acute death of adult animals  <cit> . differences in virulence have been attributed to numerous factors including host genetics, management practices, and virus strain heterogeneity  <cit> . relatively little is known about the interactions of prrsv and host cells. the lymph node is an anatomic site where the innate immune response and adaptive immune system interface. tracheobronchial lymph nodes  in swine drain the lung field and provide the focal structure that can reproducibly be identified. although the tbln contains a number of cell types, sampling this tissue allows study of direct and indirect effects of an infectious agent on the lung and cells within the lymph node.

in  <dig> a unique syndrome with high morbidity and mortality was recognized in growing pigs in china that was originally known as porcine high fever disease  due to its uncertain etiology  <cit> . experimental infection of pigs in china with these novel viral isolates reproduced the clinical disease providing strong evidence for the role of prrsv as the causal agent of phfd. however, there was still a question as to whether there was some unknown agent in the prrsv preparations that increased the severity of the clinical disease over what was expected for a “routine” prrsv infection. this question was resolved when phfd was reproduced in china with virus derived from an infectious clone of the jx <dig> prrsv isolate  <cit>  demonstrating that prrsv isolates with a common genetic motif had a causal role in phfd leading to this lineage of virus being called highly pathogenic prrsv . we imported a plasmid containing a full-length clone of the  <dig> jxwn <dig> hp-prrsv isolate  <cit>  from which infectious virus  was rescued. an animal study was conducted comparing the pathogenicity of hp-prrsv isolate rjxwn <dig> with the north american prototype strain vr- <dig> prrsv  <cit> . the objective of this report was to investigate gene expression profiles in porcine tracheobronchial lymph node  during viral infection with hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> strain alongside of us prrsv strain vr- <dig> at a snapshot of  <dig> days post-infection using bioinformatics.

RESULTS
mapping short rna-seq reads and estimating transcript expression levels
genomic short-read nucleotide alignment program  was used for alignment and genome construction, and cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant  <cit> . the rnaseq yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads for the control,  <dig> , <dig> reads for the hp-prrsv, and  <dig> , <dig> for vr- <dig> libraries after quality trimming and excluding any reads less than  <dig> bp. cufflinks was used to measure transcript abundances in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped . the cuffdiff output contained normalized fpkm for comparison between libraries . these values were used to calculate the fold change  in expression between the experimental unit and the control.

examination of the rnaseq data indicated that there were major changes in transcript abundance occurring in the prrsv-infected tbln-based unique transcripts . of these total transcripts,  <dig> were found to be significant hits in the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> library and  <dig> were significant in the us prrsv vr- <dig> library . of those  <dig> significant hits within the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> library  <dig> hits were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated more than 3-fold whilst in the us prrsv vr- <dig> library  <dig> hits were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated more than 3-fold.

this derived catalog of expressed genes represents the first comparative analysis of the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> and vr-2332-infected tbln transcript abundance profiles and provides a database that informs us of genes involved in normal tbln physiology, as well as genes whose abundance is altered by prrsv infection.

annotation of significantly differentially expressed genes
gene annotation of all significant hits  was then carried out using a mysql database matching the ensmbl  chromosome location of aligned transcripts to gene names. gene ids and log <dig> fold-change expression values for significant hits, that had fpkm values in both the control and the infected differential expression testing for transcripts , were then analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis software. when comparing the tbln transcriptome from sham-inoculated controls vs. the hp-prrsv rjxwn06-infected pigs,  <dig> of the  <dig> gene ids mapped to the ingenuity knowledge base and  <dig> were up-regulated while  <dig> were down-regulated. in the tbln of control vs. vr-2332-infected pigs,  <dig> of the  <dig> gene ids mapped to the ingenuity knowledge base and only  <dig> were up-regulated while  <dig> were down-regulated.

analysis of the genomic data in the context of gene ontology, by ingenuity pathway analysis , allowed us to ascribe biological functional networks to the differentiated transcript abundance dataset. the top functions identified with the ingenuity canonical pathway list, filtered to apoptosis, cellular immune response, cytokine signalling, humoral immune responses and pathogen-influenced signalling, based on differentially expressed genes were: granzyme a signalling, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells, il- <dig> signalling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, il- <dig> signalling and production in macrophages, complement system, interferon signalling, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, il-17a signalling in fibroblasts, granzyme b signalling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, differential regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and t helper cells by il-17a and il-17f that were above the threshold of p value <  <dig> , as calculated by fischer's test representing the ratio of number of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway and the number of all known genes ascribed to the pathway. the genes up-regulated in the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> infected pigs’ tbln were associated in  <dig> networks: from biological networks with functions associated with cell death, antimicrobial responses and cancer, with the highest network score of  <dig>  i.e. the likelihood of genes in this network would have approximately a 10- <dig> chance of occurring randomly, and  <dig> focus molecules, i.e. the starting points for generating biological networks; to networks with functions associated with nervous system development and function, organ morphology and reproductive system disease with a score of  <dig> and  <dig> focus molecule. many of the up-regulated networks related to cell death and inflammatory response functions fit with the results previously reported  <cit>  where hp-prrsv strain rjxwn <dig> caused severe disease, resulted in up to 100x higher abundance of virus and produced an exacerbated release of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, when compared to type  <dig> prototype strain vr- <dig>  wide spread tissue damage  <cit>  and cell death were observed as predicted by up-regulation of cell-death associated genes  in the network representation of the mostly highly rated network for hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> by ipa. the down-regulated network functions in the hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> infected tbln included activities associated with cellular function and maintenance, tissue morphology, metabolic disease, organismal development, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, post-translational modification, protein folding, developmental disorder, which may be associated with cell death and reflects a severe disease state. similarly, the down-regulated network functions in the vr- <dig> infected tbln were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization.

this study produced transcriptional profiles of tblns from non-infected, hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> and us prrsv vr-2332-infected pigs that provides insight into immune dysregulation elicited by the virus on host transcript abundance levels necessary for a effective immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
this rna-seq compendium extends the analyses of previous gene expression atlases performed using affymetrix genechip technology and provides an example of new methods to accommodate the increase in transcriptome data obtained from next generation sequencing  <cit> .

it is well established that many pathogens cause changes in expression of specific genes that act to protect the host and clear the infection. prrsv strains differ in their dysregulation of the immune response to infection and delay in development of a protective immune response in vaccinated pigs  <cit> . a higher number of significantly differentially expressed gene instances were detected in hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> than vr- <dig> when normalized to control samples at a snapshot of  <dig> days post inoculation . as anticipated, some of the genes  and pathways identified would be expected to be involved in the host response to a severe disease. in the case of resistin, it would be expected that adipose tissue stores are being mobilized as part of the host response to infection, which includes a high fever typical of infection with hp-prrsv. there are specific cellular proteins that regulate a protective immune response, for example the pro-inflammatory genes that were up-regulated to a greater extent in hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> than vr- <dig> when normalized to control samples as observed when comparing the pathogenicity of hp-prrsv isolate rjxwn <dig> with the north american prototype strain vr- <dig> prrsv. at  <dig> dpi hp-prrsv rjxwn <dig> inoculated pigs had an interstitial pneumonia that was significantly more severe than thevr- <dig> inoculated group which appeared to be convalescing  <cit> . future studies of these differentially expressed genes, their transcript abundance, protein level, and protein function will enhance our understanding of the interaction of prrsv with the host. identification of new virulence mechanisms of prrsv may improve the prospects for rational design of more effective vaccines to limit viral replication and shedding.
