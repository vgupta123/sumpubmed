BACKGROUND
leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses caused by infection with a group of pathogenic spirochetes, primarily various strains of the species leptospira interrogans  <cit> . since the first complete genome of the bacterium was published a decade ago  <cit> , remarkable progress has been made in understanding its genetic blueprint as well as the functions of a variety of its genes. however, major obstacles in the genetic analysis of l. interrogans remain; these are partly related to the slow growth rate of the bacterium and the lack of efficient genetic manipulation tools  <cit> .

plasmids and prophages are known to contribute to horizontal gene transfer, and their remnants are commonly found in bacterial genomes  <cit> . because these elements can carry diverse genetic information allowing them to play specific physiological roles in the host bacterium, they potentially serve as efficient genetic tools  <cit> . numerous linear and circular plasmids have been found in another pathogenic spirochete, borrelia burgdorferi, and nine of them were identified as being prophage derived  <cit> . among them, pgk <dig> was developed as an expression vector for b. burgdorferi, and this plasmid has significantly assisted investigation of the in vivo functions of particular genes  <cit> .

in the genus leptospira, saprophytic leptospira biflexa serovar patoc strain patoc i was shown to harbor a plasmid  and atemperate phage, le <dig>  <cit> . the latter, which was developed as a l. biflexa–escherichia coli shuttle vector, contains the le <dig> replication region and an antibiotic resistance marker, and has been shown to replicate in saprophytic l. biflexa, but not in pathogenic l. interrogans  <cit> . although plasmids and prophage remnants have recently been reported in other leptospira species  <cit> , a leptospiral genetic transform system has not yet been well established. recently, random transposon mutagenesis and targeted mutagenesis in pathogenic leptospires have been achieved, and these have undoubtedly assisted genetic characterization of potential virulence factors in pathogenic l. interrogans  <cit> . a method for conjugative transfer between e. coli and leptospira spp. has also been developed using rp <dig> derivative conjugative plasmids to deliver the transposon, himar <dig>  <cit> . however, genetic complementation of knockout mutants remains a challenge and still has to be conducted using transposon-mediated insertion or homologous recombination. because the transposon integration site is uncertain, substantial time and energy are required to verify successful complementation. therefore, development of an efficient genetic manipulation system in pathogenic leptospira remains a highly warranted research goal.

in this study, we sequenced the complete genome of the highly virulent l. interrogans serogroup grippotyphosa serovar linhai strain  <dig>  followed by an intensive and detailed study of the three extrachromosomal circular replicons that were identified, with the goal of obtaining better understanding of this bacterium.

RESULTS
complete sequencing and de novo assembly of the l. interrogans serovar linhai strain  <dig> genome revealed three extrachromosomal circular dna replicons
three circular extrachromosomal replicons, designated lcp <dig>  lcp <dig>  and lcp <dig> were found in l. interrogans serovar lai strain  <dig> through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly . according to the level of sequence-read coverage in each assembly, it was estimated that the three replicons shared equal copy numbers with the chromosomes. the overall g + c contents of lcp <dig> and lcp <dig> were, at about 35%, similar to that of the chromosomes, whereas lcp <dig> had a relatively higher g + c content of 39%. basic local alignment search tool  analysis suggested that the vast majority of the genes encoded by the three replicons were hypothetical proteins, while a small portion encoded phage-related proteins . it is noteworthy that lcp <dig> encoded more phage-related proteins  than the other two extrachromosomal replicons, lcp <dig>  and lcp <dig> . furthermore, the strand-bias distribution of the lcp <dig> genes, with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes clustered on the same strand was also significantly different from that of the other two replicons.figure  <dig>

plasmid dna extraction followed by physical mapping confirmed the auto-replication traits of lcp <dig>  lcp <dig>  and lcp3
to confirm that the three putative low-copy-number circular plasmid replicons  were definitely extrachromosomal replicons, plasmid dna from l. interrogans serovar linhai strain  <dig> was extracted using the classical alkaline lysis method and was then used for southern blot analysis employing both plasmid-derived and chromosomal dna-specific probes. as indicated in additional file  <dig>  in addition to the untreated dna extracts, a specific restriction endonuclease, which has a unique restriction site in each of the candidate plasmids, was used to digest the dna extracts separately in order to observe their linear configurations. dna bands corresponding to different configurations of the plasmids were apparent after hybridization with plasmid-specific probes but absent using the chromosomal flab specific probe. this result suggested that the three replicons were all present in the bacteria as circular extrachromosomal plasmids.

to determine whether the three plasmids were integrate into chromosomes, genomic dna was digested with selected rare-cutting restriction enzymes followed by in situ pulsed-field gel electrophoresis -based southern blot analysis. for lcp <dig>  cutting with the restriction enzymes noti and asci , was confirmed by southern blotting using an lcp3-specific probe. the result showed that dna bands of about 50 kb were obtained, a result consistent with the in silico predicted size of lcp <dig> . similarly, after digestion with a single restriction enzyme and southern blot hybridization with lcp1- and lcp2-specific probes, the same restriction patterns were observed for lcp <dig> and lcp2; these were identical to the linearized forms of these plasmids . when the extracted genomes containing the replicons were analyzed by pfge without digestion, no linear forms of the replicons were detected by southern blots, and the visible bands after ethidium bromide staining possibly represented remnants of the degraded genomes.figure  <dig>

during sequence assembly, we found five sequences that were identical among the lcp <dig> and lcp <dig> plasmids and the chromosomes listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  to confirm the circular nature of lcp <dig> and lcp <dig>  and to also exclude the possibility of plasmid integration, polymerase chain reaction  strategies employing primer pairs encompassing identical sequences between the plasmids and chromosomes were amplified, followed by dna sequencing of the pcr products. figure  <dig> shows the pcr results encompassing the large identical sequence repeats  <dig>   between lcp <dig> and chromosome ci as well as the identical repeat sequence rp <dig>  between lcp <dig> and chromosome ci. pcr products were successfully obtained with the plasmid-located primer pairs , as were products from chromosomally located primer pairs , thereby confirming that lcp <dig> and lcp <dig> are extrachromosomal. the assumption that the two plasmids might be capable of chromosomal integration was rejected when no pcr products from plasmid-located primer and chromosomally located primer pairs were detected , thus excluding the possibility of lcp <dig> and lcp <dig> integrating into the chromosomes .figure  <dig>

taken together, these results show that the three plasmids are extrachromosomal, and also exclude the possibility that they might be able to integrate into chromosomes. in addition, pfge analysis of strain 56609′, which originated from strain  <dig> after prolonged in vitro laboratory passage, digested with same single restriction enzymes, showed identical bands as those from strain  <dig>  which further confirms the high stability of these circular plasmids .

plasmid lcp <dig> is likely to be an inducible prophage in l. interrogans strain 56609
according to the annotation results, plasmid lcp <dig> encodes  <dig> phage-related proteins, including those for bacteriophage replication, regulation, packaging, head and tail morphogenesis, and lytic cycle-related proteins; however, it lacks integrase and is, therefore, thought to be a prophage. mitomycin c was used to induce prophage production. two days after addition of mitomycin c to l. interrogans strain  <dig> cultures, cell lysis was apparent by a decrease in the optical density of the culture ; lysis was nearly complete in 8 days, and was confirmed by dark-field microscopy. transmission electron microscopy examination revealed bacteriophage-like particles , each with a 45–50 nm diameter isometric head and an approximately 90-nm-long noncontractile tail, both of which are morphologically similar to those of the siphoviridae family. additionally, phage particles of the same size were observed inside l. interrogans cells 12 h after addition of mitomycin c .figure  <dig>

expression of all  <dig> phage-related genes in lcp <dig>  lcp <dig>  and lcp <dig> was examined by reverse-transcription -pcr after mitomycin c induction. with the exception of the open reading frames  lil <dig> to lil <dig>  which are involved in the partition and replication of plasmid lcp <dig> and are expressed at all stages, all of the other phage-related genes in lcp <dig> were specifically activated at different times by mitomycin c induction. meanwhile, most orfs in lcp <dig> and lcp <dig> showed no obvious changes in expression after mitomycin c induction . seven representative genes in lcp <dig> were chosen for further examination by quantitative pcr, and similar results were obtained . these results, to some extent, suggest that plasmid lcp <dig> is likely to be an inducible prophage in l. interrogans strain  <dig> 

characterization of replication origins in the three plasmids and development of a transformation system for pathogenic leptospira species
plasmid partition systems usually consist of the two partition proteins called para and parb; these constitute the partition complex and are encoded by two coupled genes known as parab  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis revealed parab genes in the three plasmids . furthermore, rep genes encoding replication proteins in the three plasmids  were found to be located immediately downstream of parab in their corresponding plasmids. all of these rep proteins contain putative helix-turn-helix motifs, similar to orf <dig> encoded by the le <dig> phage genome in l. biflexa  <cit> , and la <dig> encoded by the genomic island laigi in the l. interrogans serovar lai genome  <cit> . lil <dig> in lcp <dig> exhibited low sequence similarity with orf <dig> with only 27% identity and 73% coverage, whereas lil <dig> in lcp <dig> was highly similar to la <dig> with 96% identity and 96% coverage.

to characterize the essential replication regions in the three plasmids, dna fragments containing single rep or rep combined with parab loci were pcr amplified and then cloned into the l. biflexa–e. coli shuttle vector  to replace the original le <dig> rep gene. six l. interrogans–e. coli shuttle vectors were thus generated and designated lcp1l and lcp1s, lcp2l and lcp2s, and lcp3l and lcp3s, containing either rep and parab in “l” or rep alone in “s”, respectively. the plasmids prepared from e. coli were transformed into different leptospira strains by electroporation. transformed strains included the pathogenic l. interrogans strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the saprophytic l. biflexa strain patoc i. the le <dig> rep-based shuttle vector pgkble <dig> was used as a positive control and its rep deleted pgkble24-rep derivative was used as a negative control . as expected, the positive control  was able to transform into saprophytic l. biflexa but was unable to transform into pathogenic leptospira species  <cit> . shuttle vectors lcp3l/s from lcp <dig> were able to transform into all four of the leptospira strains we tested. however, the shuttle vectors lcp1l/s from lcp <dig>  could transform into the 56601and  <dig> strain, while the shuttle vectors lcp2l/s from lcp <dig> could only transform into the saprophytic l. biflexa patoc i strain. all transformants were confirmed by pcr using primers specific for the shuttle vectors . the plasmid transformation efficiencies for the saprophytic l. biflexa and pathogenic l. interrogans strains were similar, reaching 5 × 10− <dig> electrotransformants per recipient cell. the stability of the shuttle vectors in l. interrogans cells was confirmed by a hamster infection model and pcr amplification of the shuttle vector genes in pathogenic l. interrogans recovered from the livers of the infected hamsters . our data not only confirmed autonomous replication capability for all three plasmids, but also revealed the differential transformability of the shuttle vector constructs with different replication origins against various kinds of recipient hosts, as summarized in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

to detect if differences in host-specificity resulted from genetic incompatibility in the hosts, we tested  <dig> leptospira strains endemic in china for the presence of rep genes from the three plasmids using southern blot hybridization . comparisons of the transformability data against the rep sequence distribution for the three plasmids from strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed that the shuttle vectors only transformed hosts lacking the rep sequence of the same origin. therefore, genetic incompatibility is likely to account for the differences observed in the shuttle vectors abilities to transform into different leptospira species recipients.

finally, rep protein from the three plasmids studied herein appears to be widely distributed among leptospira strains, as shown by ncbi nonredundant protein database searches on leptospira species genome using blastp, where  <dig> hits for lcp <dig>   <dig> hits for lcp <dig>  and seven hits for lcp <dig>  were obtained. this finding again suggests that complete sequencing and de novo assembly are critical for novel discoveries from genomic data mining.

discussion
extrachromosomal replicons were identified in pathogenic l. interrogans in this study. because of the high proportion of homologous sequences among lcp <dig>  lcp <dig> and chromosomes, plasmids tend to be easily assembled into chromosomes. additionally, the low copy number of plasmids makes it hard to differentiate them from the large number of sequence reads generated from chromosomes. furthermore, low sequence similarity among proteins encoded by extrachromosomal replicons also makes it difficult to identify plasmid-specific proteins based on sequence comparisons against other well-characterized plasmids. also, the large sizes of plasmids also challenges methods designed to verify auto-replicons in bacteria. in this study, we confirmed the location of all three replicons in l. interrogans through the combined use of genomic sequence-directed pcr, plasmid-specific probe-based southern hybridization and extrachromosomal replicon-oriented pfge. all the results indicated the stable presence of the three plasmids as auto-replicons in the bacterium. furthermore, we observed phage particles in l. interrogans strain  <dig> cultures by induction with mitomycin c, a well-known inducer of phages. genomic annotation identified para, parb, and rep homologous sequences in lcp <dig>  lcp <dig>  and lcp <dig>  all of which are notable for their indispensable roles in plasmid replication and stability  <cit> . the function of the three replicons was verified also by constructing functional shuttle vectors capable of autonomous replication in l. biflexa and/or l. interrogans. the results confirmed that these replicons are extra-chromosomally present and able to be auto-replicated.

for the purpose of genetic manipulation, electroporation employing suicide delivery vectors is the first choice for most researchers. when transposons are constructed in a suicide delivery vector, the transformation efficiency is about  <dig>  × 10− <dig> electrotransformants per recipient cell for l. interrogans and 2 × 10− <dig> for l. biflexa  <cit> . conjugative plasmids delivering the himar <dig> transposon between e. coli and leptospira spp. reached efficiencies of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> transconjugants per recipient cell in l. interrogans and 1 × 10− <dig> in l. biflexa, respectively, values around  <dig> times higher than that of transformation. although these established genetics systems facilitate the manipulation of functional genes in leptospira, particularly in saprophytic l. biflexa, genetic manipulation in pathogenic l. interrogans remains especially difficult because of the low efficiencies of electroporation and conjugation combined with the slow growth rate of l. interrogans. in this study, the electroporation transformation efficiency of the replication plasmids reached 5 × 10− <dig> electrotransformants per recipient cell in both l. biflexa and l. interrogans. this indicates that the transformation efficiency of these newly constructed replicative plasmids in l. interrogans is  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than before.

combining the transformability data from the shuttle vectors , with the wide distribution of the rep gene in different hosts, suggests that genetic incompatibility between plasmids and hosts should be considered in leptospira strains because shuttle vectors apparently cannot transform into a host that harbors the same rep gene. however, a plasmid’s inability to be transformed cannot be fully attributed to genetic incompatibility between itself and its host. although orf <dig> is absent in l. interrogans, it is reported that a shuttle vector containing orf <dig> is unable to transform into pathogenic leptospira strains  <cit> . we have also confirmed that it was unable to transform into l. interrogans strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it has been reported that the shuttle vector derived from the rep protein la <dig> in laigi can transform into l. interrogans hond utrecht iv and l. biflexa patoc i strains but is unable to transform the l. interrogans copenhageni strain  <cit> . meanwhile, the rep gene la_ <dig> was found to be present in the l. interrogans hond utrecht iv strain but not in the l. interrogans copenhageni strain. hence, further systematic analyses are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying genetic transformability among leptospira species, especially for pathogenic l. interrogans strains.

CONCLUSIONS
research on pathogenic leptospira has lagged far behind that of other pathogenic bacteria, primarily because of the lack of effective genetic manipulation tools suitable for l. interrogans. in fact, the first major breakthrough in understanding the genetics of l. interrogans came with the availability of its whole genome sequence  <cit>  and accumulation of abundant genomic sequencing data from it. with comprehensive information about the genetic blue print of l. interrogans coupled with epigenetic readouts from transcriptomics and proteomics in this species, in vitro biochemical and molecular biological analyses have already unveiled some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiology and pathology of this bacterium. however, without access to an efficient genetic manipulation system for in vivo analysis, it is impossible to obtain comprehensive knowledge about the biology of l. interrogans through in vitro biochemical analysis and sequence data based on in silico analysis alone. therefore, the shuttle vectors developed and validated in this study represent a new milestone in research on pathogenic leptospira. moreover, these resources have strong potential to improve our understanding of the genomic composition of l. interrogans and genetic incompatibility in this bacterium.
