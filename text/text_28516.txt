BACKGROUND
cotton is the most important natural textile fiber source worldwide. the tetraploid species gossypium hirsutum l. , also referred to as ‘upland cotton’, accounts for 95 % of the world’s cotton production. early fiber production is one of the most important traits in cotton, and the selection and popularization of early-maturing cotton varieties are of significant value in reducing the dilemma of whether to plant farmlands with cotton or cereals during cropping system optimization in china  <cit> . early maturity is a complex quantitative trait that mainly includes components such as the growth period, growth stages  and boll-opening period), yield percentage before frost , node of the first fruiting branch , and height of the node of the first fruiting branch   <cit> . these components of this quantitative trait are regulated by quantitative trait loci  and the environment, as reflected in different genetic models in different cultivars  <cit> . early maturity has been reported to be negatively correlated with yield and fiber quality  <cit> . it is difficult to simultaneously improve early maturity, yield and fiber quality using conventional breeding methods. fortunately, the rapid development of applied genomics research has provided alternative tools to improve efficiency in plant breeding programs. for example, molecular markers linked to causal genes or qtls can be used for marker-assisted selection  and genomic selection.

over the last two decades, many qtls related to target traits have been identified using qtl-mapping methods by constructing intraspecific segregating populations of g. hirsutum with different target traits, such as fiber quality traits , yield and its components  <cit> , resistance traits , early maturation traits  <cit>  and drought-related traits  <cit> . in a study of traits associated with early maturity in cotton, more than  <dig> related qtls were detected by linkage mapping  <cit> . these qtls may be valuable for improving early maturity by mas.

association mapping is another effective approach for connecting phenotypes and genotypes in plants when information on population structure and linkage disequilibrium  is available  <cit> . this method is convenient because it helps to avoid the difficulty of screening large biparental mapping populations. association mapping was introduced to maize genetics in  <dig>  <cit>  and has been subsequently applied in studies of many plant species  <cit> . association mapping is widely used to identify molecular markers associated with target traits, and it has been employed in genetic studies of rice, maize, wheat and other important agricultural crops . genome-wide association studies  represent a powerful approach for identifying the locations of genetic factors that underlie complex traits  <cit> . gwas have been successfully implemented in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  for the identification of single nucleotide polymorphism  loci and candidate genes for various ecological and agricultural traits. in recent years, association mapping has also been widely used in studies of cotton . for example, abdurakhmonov et al.  <cit>  performed association mapping to examine qtls related to fiber-quality traits in g. hirsutum accessions using microsatellite markers. further, kantartzi and stewart  <cit>  detected qtls related to fiber quality in g. arboreum accessions using association mapping with simple sequence repeat  markers. recently, association mapping was performed to assess qtl alleles during three cotton breeding periods, revealing that some alleles could be detected in nearly all of the chinese cotton cultivars studied  <cit> . favorable qtl alleles for yield and its components have been identified via association mapping in chinese upland cotton cultivars  <cit> . some qtl alleles associated with verticillium wilt resistance in upland cotton have also been detected using this approach  <cit> . however, few qtls for cotton early maturity traits have been identified via association mapping.

to better understand the genetic architecture of early maturity traits in upland cotton, genome-wide snp discovery based on the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  method and a gwas strategy were used to identify the snp loci associated with early maturity traits. we successfully identified several significant associations between snp loci and early maturity traits using the generalized linear model  and mixed linear model . the highly favorable snp alleles for early maturity traits were mined by computing the phenotypic effect of each snp locus identified, and the pyramiding effects of the highly favorable snp alleles for these traits were assessed. moreover, major snp loci and potential candidate genes for early maturity were detected. the results of this important study serve as a foundation for analyses of the genetic mechanisms underlying cotton earliness and for mas for early maturity in cotton.

RESULTS
genome and chromosome characteristics of slaf-based snps in upland cotton varieties
slaf-seq was performed with an illumina hiseq  <dig>  at biomarker technologies corporation in beijing to genotype  <dig> cotton varieties/accessions. the sequencing run generated  <dig>  gb of data, including  <dig>  million paired-end reads with an length of ~80 bp. the q <dig> ratio and guanine-cytosine  content, which are indicators of sequencing quality, were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, indicative of good quality. a total of  <dig>  high-quality slaf tags were obtained for each of the  <dig> genotypes, and  <dig>  polymorphic slafs were identified from these reads by performing sequence alignments with the tm- <dig> reference genome  <cit> . the slafs, which had an average depth of  <dig> -fold per sample among the  <dig> varieties/accessions, were used for calling snps. a total of  <dig>  snps were initially called for the  <dig> genotypes . snp loci with a minor allele frequency  of <5 % cannot be used in association analyses; thus, most of the snps  were removed, and the remaining  <dig>  snps with an maf ≥ <dig>  were used in subsequent analyses.fig.  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  distributions on the  <dig> chromosomes of upland cotton. at1 ~ at <dig> and dt1 ~ dt <dig> in vertical axis are the serial number of  <dig> chromosomes; the horizontal axis shows chromosome length ; 0 ~  <dig> depicts snp density

population structure and linkage disequilibrium
to estimate the number of subgroups in the population of  <dig> upland cotton accessions, structure analysis was performed using  <dig>  snps from the  <dig> accessions. the results indicated that the minimum number of cross-validation errors was k =  <dig>  which was thus determined to be the optimum k, and that the testing accessions could be separated into nine subpopulations . subpopulations 1– <dig> included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> accessions, respectively. to represent the genetic diversity among the  <dig> accessions, a total of  <dig> upland cotton lines were screened, which included approximately 50 % of the accessions of each of the subpopulations, taking into consideration the diverse geographic origins and maturity traits. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> lines were selected from each of the subpopulations 1– <dig>  respectively. most of these upland cotton accessions from each subpopulation had mixed ancestry, and the obvious geographic subpopulation was not found, indicating that these lines might have experienced introgression or gene flow during cotton breeding in china.fig.  <dig> population structure and linkage disequilibrium  decay of upland cotton accessions. a population structure of upland cotton accessions; each line is represented by a single vertical line, and each color represents one cluster; b estimated ln calculated for k, ranging from  <dig> to 10; c the mean ld decay rate was estimated as the squared correlation coefficient  using all pairs of snps located within 600 kb of physical distance in genomic regions in a population of  <dig> upland cotton germplasm accessions



to determine the mapping resolution for gwas, we quantified the average extent of ld decay. using the whole set of snps, the ld decay rate of the population for the entire genome was estimated to be 100 kb, with r2 =  <dig>  at half of the maximum value .

phenotypic characteristics of traits related to early maturity
a core set of  <dig> upland cotton lines was selected for association analysis based on analysis of the population structure, and the traits of these lines related to early maturity were investigated across four field environments. the mean whole growth period  durations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  d in the four experiments, respectively. the minimum wgp was  <dig>  d in su- <dig>  and the maximum wgp was  <dig>  d in sp- <dig>  analogously, the ft and fbp exhibited wide ranges of  <dig> – <dig>  d and  <dig> – <dig>  d, with means of  <dig>  and  <dig>  d, respectively. the nffb ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a mean of  <dig> . the mean hnffb values exhibited continuous variation, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. the ypbf exhibited the largest range of variation, ranging from  <dig>  to 100 %. the mean coefficients of variance  for the wgp, ft, fbp, nffb, hnffb and ypbf were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. these data indicated a high degree of diversity in early maturity phenotypic traits in the natural population. based on the wgp, the number of early-maturing accessions , early-middle-maturing accessions  and middle-late-maturing accessions  were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the early-middle-maturing accessions accounted for a very small percentage, thus these traits were typically bimodally distributed .fig.  <dig> frequency distributions of the mean values of six maturity traits of  <dig> cotton accessions in four environments. a whole growth period ; b flowering time ; c flowering and boll-setting period ; d node of the first fruiting branch ; e height of the node of the first fruiting branch ; and f yield percentage before frost 



analysis of variance  indicated that the genotype  and interactions between the genotype and environmental factors  were both significant  for all six traits . the correlation coefficients for the association of the wgp with the ft, fbp, nffb, hnffb and ypbf were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and − <dig> , respectively. these results indicated that the wgp was significantly associated with the ft, fbp, nffb, hnffb and ypbf in all four environments  .

gwas for early maturity traits
to investigate the genotypic variation that underlies the traits related to early maturity in cotton, gwas was performed to identify the associated snp loci in upland cotton accessions. in the glm,  <dig> associations were found to be significant between  <dig> snp loci and five traits related to early maturity  according to the best linear unbiased predictions  and in at least two of the four environments  ≥ <dig> ). of these snp loci, 50 % were distributed on chromosome dt <dig>  and 25 % were distributed on chromosome at <dig>  among these associations, five associations each with the wgp and ft were identified, as well as one association each with the fbp, nffb and ypbf; the corresponding snp loci were distributed on chromosome dt <dig>  the snp loci for various early maturity traits identified through gwas explained  <dig> – <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance . among these associated snp loci, three were co-associated with two or more different traits. for example, rs <dig>  was simultaneously associated with the wgp, ft, nffb and ypbf . the mlm results indicated that two associations were significant between one snp locus and two traits  ≥  <dig> ), i.e., one snp locus  on chromosome dt <dig> was found to be simultaneously associated with the wgp and ft according to blups and in two of the four environments, explaining  <dig> – <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance . it was very important and meaningful that the snp locus rs <dig> was simultaneously associated with the wgp and ft and was detected via both the glm and mlm .fig.  <dig> manhattan plots of genome-wide association studies  for the wgp , ft , nffb  and ypbf  measured with the generalized linear model  using the best linear unbiased prediction  values for the four environments. the snp locus rs <dig> is indicated by the black arrow. the general and highly significant trait-associated snps are distinguished by the red and blue threshold lines, respectively

mining of highly favorable snp alleles associated with early maturity traits
in our study, snp alleles with positive effects that led to decreases in the wgp, ft, fbp, nffb and hnffb or an increase in the ypbf were defined as “favorable alleles”, and those that resulted in increases in the wgp, ft, fbp, nffb and hnffb or a decrease in the ypbf were defined as “unfavorable alleles”. among the favorable snp alleles, rs <dig> , rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> had the strongest positive phenotypic effects on the wgp, shortening it by  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d, respectively; in addition, rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> shortened the ft by  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d, respectively; rs <dig> shortened the fbp by  <dig>  d; and rs <dig> shortened the nffb by  <dig> , whereas it increased the ypbf by  <dig>  %. these findings indicated that the phenotypic characteristics of the genotypes with favorable snp alleles were significantly enhanced compared with those of the genotypes with unfavorable snp alleles, with the exception of rs <dig> and rs <dig> . the highly favorable snp alleles exhibited significantly different traits compared with the unfavorable alleles . finally, the eleven highly favorable snp alleles were mined by anova. the numbers of highly favorable snp alleles for the wgp, ft, fbp, nffb and ypbf were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> favorable snp alleles, their phenotypic effects , and representative accessions

pyramiding effects of highly favorable snp alleles associated with early maturity traits
to determine whether the highly favorable snp alleles for traits related to early maturity had pyramiding effects, the mean wgp, ft, fbp, nffb and ypbf values of the accessions that contained different numbers of highly favorable snp alleles were analyzed by anova. the results indicated that earlier maturation occurred in the cotton accessions with the highly favorable snp alleles compared with those without these alleles, as well as those with fewer of these alleles . for example, the average wgp of the genotypes without highly favorable alleles was  <dig>  d, that of those with a single highly favorable allele was  <dig>  d, that of those with two highly favorable alleles was  <dig>  d, and that of those with four highly favorable alleles was  <dig>  d.table  <dig> pyramiding effects of the highly favorable alleles that contribute to early maturity

in addition, to further assess the pyramiding effects of the highly favorable snp alleles on the early maturity response, linear regression was conducted with the number of highly favorable snp alleles and the average wgp and ft values for the four environments. two significant linear correlations were detected between the wgp and number of highly favorable snp alleles  and between the ft and number of highly favorable snp alleles , further confirming the pyramiding effects of the highly favorable alleles . these findings demonstrate that the highly favorable snp alleles had significant pyramiding effects on the wgp and ft.fig.  <dig> linear regression analyses of the numbers of highly favorable snp alleles and average wgp  and ft values  in four environments



a major locus on chromosome dt <dig> and candidate genes that potentially underlie early maturity
the most favorable snp locus  associated with both the wgp and ft in the glm and mlm was used to compare the differences between the accessions that carried favorable alleles and those that carried unfavorable alleles in six traits related to early maturity. the mean phenotypic value of  <dig> accessions that contained a favorable allele  was significantly better  compared with the remaining accessions that contained unfavorable alleles  . this finding demonstrates that rs <dig> on chromosome dt <dig> is a major locus for early maturity in upland cotton.fig.  <dig> favorable alleles  and unfavorable alleles  at the snp locus rs <dig> for six traits related to early maturity in the four environments. a–f represent six traits related to early maturity wgp, ft, fbp, nffb, hnffb and ypbf, respectively; *, ** indicate significance at probability levels of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively; sp- <dig>  su- <dig>  sp- <dig> and su- <dig> are the four environments



a total of  <dig> genes were annotated in the 1 mb regions within 500 kb on either side of the most favorable snp allele  . among these genes, definite biological function annotations could not be determined for six, and ten were annotated as putative or hypothetical proteins; among the remaining genes,  <dig> possessed domains of known function, and four of these  <dig> genes  had potential involvement in the early maturity response in plants. two early-maturing cotton varieties and two late-maturing varieties were selected. the wgps of the early-maturing varieties zhongmiansuo <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig> were  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d, respectively, and those of the late-maturing varieties lumianyan <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig> were  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d, respectively . similarly, the ft of the early-maturing varieties was significantly shorter than that of the late-maturing varieties  . the transcription levels of the  <dig> genes were assessed by qrt-pcr using samples from the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, ovules and fibers of upland cotton. examples of these results are shown in additional file 6: figure s5a. in particular, high expression levels of cotad_ <dig> and cotad_ <dig> were detected in the leaves, whereas low expression levels were identified in the roots, stems, flowers, ovules and fibers . in addition, qrt-pcr was used to examine the expression patterns of  <dig> genes in two early-maturing varieties and two late-maturing cotton varieties at five different leaf growth stages . from the two-leaf stage to the four-leaf stage, the expression of cotad_ <dig> in the early-maturing varieties zhongmiansuo <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig> was significantly higher than that in the late-maturing varieties lumianyan <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig>  . however, the expression of the other genes investigated did not significantly differ between the early-maturing and late-maturing varieties . these data provide support for cotad_ <dig> as a candidate gene for early maturity in upland cotton.table  <dig> candidate genes most highly associated with early maturity within 500 kb of either side of the snp locus rs13562854

discussion
identification and verification of snp loci associated with traits related to early maturity in upland cotton
both linkage mapping and association analysis provide tools for interpreting the genes that underlie complex traits. to date, linkage mapping is a major method for the mining of qtls for early maturity traits in cotton. based on the findings of previous studies, it can be concluded that only preliminary progress has been achieved toward localization of qtls for cotton early maturity traits with desirable effects in the segregation population )  <cit> , and these findings require further verification. although several studies have identified qtls for early maturity traits by association analysis in upland cotton  <cit> , these studies were limited by the sizes of the ssr markers and germplasm populations. as the availability of whole-genome sequences has increased and they have become more cost-effective to generate, the practicality of gwas has increased. in our study, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of association analysis, a wider selection of germplasm resources for upland cotton was collected that was selected based on maturity traits. further, a substantial number of snp markers were developed by genome sequencing. thirteen associations were identified between  <dig> snp loci and five early maturity traits  ≥ <dig> ) . thus, this study has addressed gaps in the study of cotton early maturity traits using gwas. most importantly, a main snp locus for the wgp and ft was identified on chromosome dt <dig> 

in a previous study, one significant qtl for the gp, bp and ypbf was found to be located close to the bridge markers dpl <dig> and cir <dig> on chr <dig>  in two biparental populations, explaining  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation  <cit> . the physical locations of these ssr markers were mapped to the genome sequence by electronic pcr  , and a main snp locus  for the wgp and ft was positioned between dpl <dig> and cir <dig>  this finding validates the gwas results and increases confidence in the identity of the main snp locus .fig.  <dig> physical maps and linkage relationships among quantitative trait loci  in previous and present studies. physical maps of the reference gossypium hirsutum genome d <dig>  <cit>  and dt <dig>  <cit>  from the present study, respectively. linkage map of c <dig>  from a previous study  <cit> 



mining of favorable snp alleles and candidate genes to improve early maturity in cotton
obtaining satisfactory yield and quality during a short growing season is complicated due to conflict between early maturity and yield, as well as between early maturity and fiber quality; thus, it is increasingly difficult to simultaneously improve upon these agriculturally desirable traits in early-maturing cotton using traditional breeding methods. therefore, the mining of favorable snp  alleles is necessary for improving important agronomic traits in upland cotton cultivars via mas. association mapping is one of the most effective approaches for the mining of favorable alleles. elite alleles for fiber-quality traits  <cit>  and yield and its components  <cit>  in upland cotton cultivars/accessions were explored via association analysis. in our study, by comparing the average phenotypic effect value of each allele for the target traits in the thirteen stable associations detected, we identified eleven highly favorable alleles for five early maturity traits . moreover, the examination of favorable snp alleles and germplasm resources for early maturity traits, such as zhongmiansuo <dig>  xia <dig>  and xiazao <dig>  could be useful for plant breeders; however, the effects of these alleles must be verified. therefore, the positive effects of highly favorable alleles were selected and assessed. to date, many studies have demonstrated that marker-based gene pyramiding strategies are very effective . dosage pyramiding effects of the highly favorable snp alleles were also demonstrated ; thus, the highly favorable alleles identified in this study have substantial potential for the development of early-maturing upland cotton cultivars in future breeding programs.

of particular interest, the detailed annotations revealed that the major locus rs <dig> was located on chromosome dt <dig> and that the  <dig> candidate genes in the nearby region were the most highly associated with the wgp and ft. specifically, four candidates  related to plant floral development were annotated. cotad_ <dig> and cotad_ <dig> were located - <dig>  kb  and  <dig>  kb , respectively, from the peak snp , with mads-box genes that encode transcription factors involved in plant developmental control and signal transduction  <cit> . notably, a wd repeat  gene  was identified  <dig>  kb from the rs <dig> locus. plant wdr proteins are intimately involved in various cellular and organismal processes, including cell division and cytokinesis, apoptosis, light signaling and vision, cell motility, flowering, floral development and meristem organization  <cit> . cotad_ <dig> expression in the early-maturing varieties zhongmiansuo <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig> was significantly higher than that in the late-maturing varieties lumianyan <dig> and zhongmiansuo <dig>  however, expression of the other genes did not significantly differ between the early-maturing and late-maturing varieties .

mads-box family genes play significant roles in plant growth and development, and they also control flowering time and flower initiation  <cit> . agamous-like <dig>  in arabidopsis is another mads-box family member that regulates the transcription of genes required for cellular differentiation and floral determination . the blast alignment results indicated that the coding sequence  identity of cotad_ <dig> with the arabidopsis agl <dig> gene was as high as  <dig>  %  and that cotad_ <dig> encoded a protein that shared  <dig>  % sequence identity with the arabidopsis agl <dig> protein . in addition, although fifty-three mads-box genes have been identified in upland cotton to date  <cit> , few molecular studies of mads-box genes in g. hirsutum have been conducted. for example, ghmads <dig> affects cell elongation in fibers  <cit> , ghmads <dig> regulates anther development  <cit> , and ghmads <dig> participates in flower development  <cit> . ghmads <dig> in arabidopsis accelerates flowering, and ghmads <dig> transgenic plants exhibit abnormal floral organ phenotypes  <cit> . in addition, we found that cotad_ <dig> shared  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with arabidopsis agl <dig> , that most mads-box family genes in upland cotton regulated flower development, and that cotad_ <dig> expression in early-maturing cotton was higher than that in late-maturing cotton . thus, it is reasonable to postulate that cotad_ <dig> may be a candidate gene for improving early maturity traits via the regulation and control of early flowering time in upland cotton. however, clear and definite identification of cotad_ <dig> as an annotated mads-box family gene requires further validation.

CONCLUSIONS
a substantial number of snp markers in upland cotton were developed through slaf-seq technology and were used in a gwas. thirteen significant associations were identified among eight snp loci and five traits related to early maturity using the glm and mlm, and two of the  <dig> associations were observed in both models. eleven highly favorable snp alleles for the wgp, ft, fbp, nffb and ypbf were identified. moreover, dosage pyramiding effects of the highly favorable snp alleles and significant linear correlations between the number of highly favorable alleles and the phenotypic values of target traits were detected. most importantly, a major locus  on chromosome dt <dig> and a potential candidate gene  for early maturity were detected. the beneficial alleles and candidate gene should be useful for improving early maturity in upland cotton breeding via a molecular design approach.
