BACKGROUND
all three major pancreatic cell types, including acinar, ductal and endocrine cells, originate from common insulin promoter factor /pancreatic and duodenal homeobox  <dig>  -expressing progenitors within the posterior foregut endoderm. initially, these cells evaginate from the foregut endoderm to form the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds that later fuse to form the proper pancreas. the pancreatic epithelium proliferates and branches into the surrounding mesenchyme to form a highly branched epithelial sheet  <cit> . concomitant with branching morphogenesis, cells of the pancreatic ductal epithelium differentiate into neurogenin  <dig> -expressing endocrine precursors through regulation of notch signalling  <cit> . during the secondary transition which starts around embryonic day  <dig>  these ngn3-positive progenitors differentiate into hormone-producing islet cells which delaminate and migrate out into the surrounding mesenchyme to initiate clustering into vascularised islets of langerhans, consisting of the α-, β-, ε-, δ- and pp-cells  <cit> .

although morphological evidence for delamination of endocrine cells from ducts was first shown by pictet and rutter  <cit> , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the delamination and migration processes are poorly understood. regarding the potential mechanisms for delamination, it has been proposed that it may involve breaking down the basal lamina, e.g. through the activity of matrix metalloproteinases   <cit> . this hypothesis was tested by analysing mice deficient for mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> or overexpressing timp <dig>  an inhibitor of mmps, during pancreas development. however neither endocrine cell delamination nor islet cell migration was effected in these mice  <cit> . in fact, these results are consistent with electron micrographs  <cit>  which provide morphological evidence for cells not breaking through the basal lamina during delamination, but rather budding off with a piece of the basal lamina intact around the delaminating endocrine cells. thus, other processes are likely to be responsible for islet cell delamination during islet morphogenesis. insights into the potential mechanisms for islet cell migration have been contributed by gene ablation studies demonstrating that wnt5a and the epidermal growth factor -receptor are required for migration of newly formed β cells from the ductal epithelium  <cit> . however, the mechanism of action remains unknown. furthermore, the fact that these mice succumb to other severe phenotypes shortly after birth, suggests that it cannot be excluded that the pancreas phenotype is secondary to other phenotypes.

cell migration requires dynamic regulation of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix  adhesion, as well as of cytoskeletal rearrangement. pioneering work highlight rho-gtpases as key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and lamellipodia formation  <cit> . the rho family of small gtpases act as molecular switches, cycling between an active gtp-bound and an inactive gdp-bound state  <cit> . numerous reports have demonstrated an active role of the rho-gtpase member rac <dig> in cell migration and cell-cell adhesion in cultured cells  <cit> . rac <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in vivo  <cit>  and rac <dig> null mutant mice show severe developmental defects, including failure to form the three germ layers during gastrulation  <cit> , precluding studies of its role in later processes such as organogenesis. in drosophila, rac <dig> regulates both tubulogenesis and dorsal closure  <cit> , suggesting an important in vivo role of rac <dig> in both cell migration and cell-cell adhesion. notably, a common denominator when rac <dig> function is perturbed is consequences on e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . however, inconsistent results, such as rac <dig> being capable of both promoting and inhibiting e-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion, make it difficult to extract a clear picture of how rac <dig> regulates e-cadherin function in vivo  <cit> .

to shed more light on the in vivo function of rac <dig> as a regulator of cell-cell adhesion and cell migration during tissue formation and organogenesis, we have addressed its role in pancreatic islet morphogenesis. for this purpose, transgenic mice were generated where a dominant negative form of rac <dig>  was expressed under regulation of the rat insulin promoter . racn <dig> has been extensively used to study rac <dig> function both in vitro and in vivo . racn <dig> has a low affinity for gtp and thereby remains in its inactive gdp bound state. by binding to upstream activating exchange factors  it is believed to prevent these factors from activating endogenous rac <dig>  <cit> .

we identify rac <dig> as a key signalling molecule regulating migration of endocrine cells away from the ductal epithelium. changes in the expression and levels of cell-cell contact e-cadherin, suggest that the mechanism of action may involve control of e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. furthermore, in vitro experiments show that betacellulin stimulated islet cell spreading and actin remodelling is compromised in transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of rac <dig> activity and islet migration in vivo.

RESULTS
previously, it was demonstrated that rac <dig> mrna is expressed in the pancreas  <cit> . here we show that in the developing pancreas rac <dig> mrna is ubiquitously expressed in all major pancreatic cell types, including ductal, acinar, endocrine and mesenchymal cells at e <dig>  and postnatal day   <dig> . notably, the most terminal parts of the ductal tree, including acinar cells, express the highest level of rac <dig> mrna . results from microarray analysis of e <dig>  embryonic pancreas suggest that the closely related rac <dig> and rac <dig> are expressed to a much lower extent  . we speculate that these low levels of rac <dig> and rac <dig> mrnas most likely represent either very low level expression within the epithelium or normal expression within haematopoetic cells  <cit> .

to investigate the role of rac <dig> in islet morphogenesis, a transgenic mouse model was generated where a c-myc-tagged dominant-negative form of the rac <dig> protein was expressed under regulation of the rat insulin promoter  <cit>  . three independent transgenic lines, confirmed by southern blot analysis , expressing comparable levels of the transgene were identified. racn <dig> was found to be expressed on average at approximately four fold higher levels compared to endogenous rac <dig> . because all three lines showed the same phenotype, the presented data is from one line. control experiments demonstrated that expression of the transgene was restricted to insulin-producing cells both in embryos  and adults, and that the expression levels of the transgene varied between individual cells within the islets . we observed no difference in body weight, pancreas weight or fasting blood glucose levels between wild-type and transgenic littermates .

blocking rac <dig> function results in impaired migration of islet cells
numerous studies have demonstrated an active role of rac <dig> in cell migration . careful analysis of pancreas development in rip-racn <dig> mice revealed no defects preceding islet morphogenesis, the ductal epithelium showed normal branching and differentiation . whereas delamination of newly differentiated β cells and subsequent clustering into vascularised islet-like structures proceeded normally, movement of islets away from ducts was perturbed. the latter was evident from the observation that islets were consistently found more closely associated with ducts compared to wild-type littermates . since almost all islets are to some extent in contact with a duct in the neonatal pancreas this phenotype was quantified by estimating the percentage of the islet circumference in contact with a duct at p <dig>  demonstrating a significant increase in islet-duct contact in transgenic mice compared to wild-type littermates . further analysis showed that this phenotype persisted in the adult . in support of this finding was the observation that mild collagenase-perfusion resulted in a significantly higher number of transgenic islets attached to ducts compared to wild-type islets – a phenotype that could be attributed to stronger islet-ecm interactions . importantly, control experiments showed that this phenotype was not secondary to an increased ductal area, i.e. the duct/pancreas ratio was the same in wild-type and rip-racn <dig> mice . furthermore, no changes in β cell area, or endocrine cell ratios were observed . finally, careful examination of the final islet morphology and shape revealed more irregularly shaped large islets in rip-racn <dig> mice compared to wild-type littermates , whereas small and medium sized islets exhibited a normal shape. altogether, these findings suggest a functional role of rac <dig> in islet cell migration and morphogenesis.

islet cell spreading in vitro depends on rac <dig> function
to further study the role of rac <dig> in islet cell migration, attempts were made to develop an in vitro islet cell migration assay. for this purpose, islets were dissociated into single cells and seeded onto gelatin-coated plates. however, neither wild-type nor transgenic cells showed any characteristic signs of migratory cells, such as lamellipodia and active remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, rendering this method unfeasible for comparative studies of cell migration in vitro . to develop an alternative strategy to study islet cell migration in vitro, we considered the fact that in vivo movement of islets involve migration of intact islet clusters rather than movement of individual islet cells. therefore, the in vitro behaviour of isolated wild-type and rip-racn <dig> islets plated on gelatin-coated dishes was compared. normally, islets attach to the surface and after a few days in culture they start to plate out on the surface, changing from a three-dimensional to a two-dimensional structure. interestingly, although transgenic islets attach to the surface, they plate out less efficiently compared to wild-type islets . nonetheless, the transgenic islets that do plate out show the same type of actin remodelling as seen in the wild-type , suggesting that the actin cytoskeletal rearrangements normally involved in the basic migratory machinery is not blocked in all islets.

failure to activate rac <dig> results in an accumulation of e-cadherin in cell-cell contacts of β cells
cell-cell adhesion is necessary for movement of cells during tissue formation and organogenesis. to regulate such events the on and off state of cell-cell adhesion must be dynamically regulated. although cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is crucial for the initial clustering of islet cells  <cit> , its contribution to movement of islets during islet morphogenesis remains unknown. the fact that numerous reports support a regulatory role of rac <dig> in e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion , led us to investigate whether expression of racn <dig> affected e-cadherin function. since isolation of neonatal islets is not feasible, western blot analysis cannot be used to quantify e-cadherin protein abundance. as an alternative method quantification of e-cadherin staining intensity was used. indeed, e-cadherin protein was upregulated in transgenic islets at p <dig> , whereas β-catenin levels appeared unaffected . quantitative reverse transcription real-time pcr on single isolated adult β cells showed a correlation between e-cadherin and racn <dig> expression, i.e. cells expressing higher levels of racn <dig> expressed higher levels of e-cadherin , suggesting that rac <dig> inhibition stimulates e-cadherin transcription and/or e-cadherin mrna stability. importantly, rac <dig> does not seem to exhibit a general effect on cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion since no/weak correlation was observed between n-cadherin and transgene mrnas . r-cadherin is also expressed in islets  <cit> , but since it is expressed at low levels and distributed mainly intracellularly  it is not considered to contribute to islet cell adhesion.

expression and localisation of ecm components remain unaltered in rip-racn <dig> mice
not only does cell migration require appropriate dynamics of cell-cell interactions, but also precise regulation of attachment and de-attachment to the surrounding ecm. the latter may also require proteolytic cleavage of the basal lamina ecm to get access to the surrounding ecm that function as a substratum for cell migration. to investigate whether the impaired migration of the islets away from the pancreatic ducts in rip-racn <dig> mice could be explained by an excessive deposition of ecm around the islets which would physically prevent movement of the islets, the distribution of various islet ecm components were examined. consistent with the demonstration that islet ecm is mainly produced by blood vessels, which are recruited to islets during islet morphogenesis  <cit> , no change in the deposition of laminin, collagen iv, and fibronectin were observed . alternatively, deficient cell migration could be explained by compromised expression/activity of ecm-receptors such as integrins. however, no change in expression pattern or activity of the major islet integrin-receptor integrin β <dig> or the adaptor, vinculin, was observed . in conclusion, these results demonstrate that rac <dig> affects islet cell-cell adhesion but appears not to affect expression/distribution of the analysed ecm components.

rac <dig> regulates betacellulin-induced spreading of islets in vitro
to identify the signalling pathway that regulates islet migration through rac <dig>  two previous observations were of particular interest. first, deficient migration of islets away from ducts was observed in egf-receptor-deficient mice  <cit> . secondly, rac <dig> activity has previously been shown to be dependent on egf-receptor stimulation in other cell types  <cit> . to investigate whether rac <dig> is a downstream signalling component of the egf-receptor during islet cell migration, isolated islets were cultured in the presence or absence of the egf-receptor ligand betacellulin. interestingly, betacellulin stimulated plating of wild-type islets . consistent with rac <dig> acting downstream of the betacellulin/egf receptor complex, betacellulin's stimulatory activity on islet plating was blocked in rip-racn <dig> islets. these results suggest that rac <dig> acts downstream of the egf-receptor during betacellulin-induced islet cell spreading.

discussion
although much is known about the cellular and molecular processes that are controlled by members of the rho-gtpases, there is still a gap in the knowledge of their extracellular effectors and their in vivo function during tissue and organ formation, in particular in mammalian organisms. in the developing pancreas, islet morphogenesis, including endocrine cell delamination from ducts and islet cell migration, has not been resolved at a cellular and molecular resolution. the fact that these events most likely involve cellular processes that have been reported to be coordinated by rac <dig>  such as cell migration and cell adhesion  <cit> , led us to study the functional role of rac <dig> in islet morphogenesis. for this purpose, a dominant negative form of rac <dig> was expressed in β cells. we show that blocking rac <dig> activity in β cells results in compromised migration of islets away from ducts. in fact, more islets remain in direct contact with ducts. the result can neither be explained by a general developmental delay, nor by an increase in the area of the ductal network. furthermore, we provide evidence that the function of rac <dig> in islet cell migration may be controlled by modulation of e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. compromised islet cell migration does not result in a major impact on islet cell function, since fasting glucose levels remained unaltered.

the conclusion that rac <dig> is involved in islet cell migration is based on both in vivo and in vitro observations. in vivo, islet cells normally migrate away from ducts subsequent to delamination and clustering. blocking rac <dig> function resulted in deficient migration away from ducts. to study the migration in more detail we used an in vitro model where isolated islets were seeded onto gelatin-coated culture dishes. normally, islets attach and eventually flatten out due to induced cell spreading. cell spreading is associated with increased formation of cell-ecm interactions  and actin remodelling by leading edge cells. however, blocking rac <dig> function in β cells resulted in reduced islet cell spreading. altogether, the in vivo and in vitro results suggest that rac <dig> is directly involved in the migration of islets and that the underlying mechanism may involve regulation of cell-ecm interactions, cell-cell adhesion, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. the in vitro studies show that betacellulin stimulated islet cell spreading and actin remodelling is compromised in transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of rac <dig> activity and islet migration in vivo.

rac <dig> has previously been shown to regulate e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. however, the picture is rather complex since rac <dig> has been reported to both promote and inhibit e-cadherin function. for example, e-cadherin activity is regulated by endocytosis, and rac <dig> has been demonstrated to both promote and block e-cadherin endocytosis  <cit> . to explain such contradictory results, it has been speculated that the effect of rac <dig> on e-cadherin endocytosis may depend on different downstream effectors due to the cellular context  <cit> . here, we provide evidence in support of rac <dig> controlling e-cadherin function during pancreatic islet morphogenesis by demonstrating that blocking rac <dig> function in β cells results in increased levels of e-cadherin mrna and protein. increased levels of e-cadherin at cell-cell contacts may create a more static cell-cell adhesion, which may inhibit the cell movement/rearrangement needed for islets cells to spread in vitro as well as for their in vivo migration away from ducts. consistently, recent data demonstrate that the consequence of blocking rac <dig> function  during drosophila tubulogenesis, results in perturbed cell rearrangement due to increased e-cadherin protein expression  <cit> . the observed increase of cell-cell contact e-cadherin may also explain the irregular shape of the largest islets in rip-racn <dig> mice. normally, islets form by fusion of the initial endocrine cell clusters that appear soon after delamination  <cit> . in order to form the final shape of the mature islet, dynamic cellular rearrangements between neighbouring cells are necessary. such processes most likely require dynamic changes in cell-cell adhesion and remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. the existence of large islets with an irregular shape in transgenic mice could either be explained by a failure of smaller islets to separate from each other or by perturbed cellular rearrangement in the largest islets. altogether, our results support the concept that islet migration away from ducts depend on rac1-mediated regulation of e-cadherin cell-cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal remodelling.

it has been suggested that migration of endocrine cells away from the ductal epithelium requires degradation of the basal lamina by mmps  <cit> . however, gene ablation studies of mmps in the developing pancreas showed no effect on islet formation  <cit> . these results indicate that degradation of the ecm is not necessary for islet migration, suggesting that rac1's role in islet migration does not involve proteolytic cleavage of ecm components. furthermore, this conclusion is consistent with the observation that the deposition of basal lamina components, such as laminin and collagen iv, as well as fibronectin was unaffected upon rac <dig> inhibition.

to identify in which signalling pathway rac <dig> acts as an effector for islet cell migration, we considered the previous findings that egf-receptor gene ablation results in a similar phenotype with increased association of islets with ducts  <cit>  and that egf-receptor signalling regulates rac <dig> activity  <cit> . to establish a potential link between rac <dig> and egf-receptor signalling during islet migration, we tested the activity of the egf-receptor ligand betacellulin on wild-type and rip-racn <dig> islet cell spreading in vitro. these experiments showed that betacellulin stimulates islet cell spreading. the fact that betacellulin was unable to promote spreading of transgenic islets suggests that rac <dig> acts as a downstream component in the betacellulin/egf-receptor signalling pathway during islet cell spreading. apart from the egf-receptor  betacellulin also binds to erbb- <dig>  however the fact that the expression of erbb- <dig> in neonatal and adult pancreas is restricted to ductal- and α-cells  <cit> , suggests that betacellulin signals through erbb- <dig>  based on these results, we propose a model for islet cell migration where betacellulin/egf-receptor signalling controls the activity of rac <dig>  which coordinates changes in e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and actin rearrangements to facilitate islet cell movement. this model predicts that the reported deficient migration of islets in egf-receptor-deficient mice is at least in part due to compromised rac <dig> activation.

racn <dig> may affect other gtpases  <cit> , thus expression of racn <dig> could in theory inhibit other rac members, such as rac <dig> and rac <dig>  however, rac <dig> and rac <dig> are not expressed in the pancreas  <cit> . moreover, racn <dig> could affect other rho-gtpases, such as cdc <dig>  however, analysis of pancreas specific ablation of cdc <dig> shows that the rip-racn <dig> phenotype cannot be attributed to blocking cdc <dig> activity . thus, although we cannot rule out that racn <dig> may affect other gtpases in β cells, we believe that the phenotype observed in rip-racn <dig> mice primarily involves rac <dig> 

our model predicts a potential link between egf-receptor signalling and e-cadherin function via rac <dig> in β cells. how does rac <dig> control the levels of e-cadherin protein in pancreatic β cell-cell contacts? to this end we provide evidence in support of rac <dig> controlling e-cadherin transcription and/or mrna stability. post-translational effects may also be operational because a recent study showed that egf induces macropinocytosis of e-cadherin through rac <dig> activation  <cit> . based on such findings, we speculate that inhibiting rac <dig> could block egf-induced recycling of e-cadherin, resulting in an accumulation of e-cadherin at the cell surface, thereby creating a more static "on-state" of cell-cell adhesion. consequently, the mechanism by which betacellulin induces migration of islets through rac <dig> could tentatively be explained by an effect on e-cadherin recycling – a question to be resolved by future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results provide new insight into how rac <dig> controls organogenesis. specifically, our data support a model where rac <dig> signalling controls islet cell migration by modulating e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. furthermore, in vitro experiments show that betacellulin stimulates cell spreading and actin remodelling in wild-type but not transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of rac <dig> activity and islet migration in vivo. our results further emphasize rac <dig> as a key regulator of cell migration and cell adhesion during tissue and organ morphogenesis.
