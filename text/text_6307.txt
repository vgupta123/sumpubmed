BACKGROUND
enkephalin-containing neurons are found in several areas of the central nervous system, including the dorsal horn of the spinal cord  <cit> , where they play an important role in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information  <cit> .

the analgesic effect of intrathecally administered 5-hydroxytryptamine  type  <dig>  receptor agonist 2-methyl-serotonin is attenuated by the opioid antagonist naloxone  <cit> , suggesting that endogenous opiate-like substances may be involved in 5-ht-induced antinociception. enkephalin-containing neurons in the superficial dorsal horn  of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in rats are innervated by 5-ht-containing fibers  <cit> . furthermore, we have reported that enkephalinergic neurons express 5-ht <dig> receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord  <cit> . these findings suggest that some antinociception is elicited by activation of 5-ht <dig> receptors in spinal dorsal horn neurons containing enkephalin.

immunohistochemical investigations showed that several sdh neurons contain both enkephalin and γ-aminobutyric acid   <cit> . we showed that activation of 5-ht <dig> receptors facilitates the release of gaba from some interneurons in sdh  <cit> . thus, the antinociceptive action of 5-ht may depend on the release of both enkephalin and gaba by sdh interneurons that express 5-ht <dig> receptors.

the preproenkephalin  promoter contains cyclic amp -responsive elements, and the expression of enkephalin is controlled by camp  <cit> . we observed that forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase , affects the expression of enkephalin-green fluorescent protein  fluorescence in neurons in mouse spinal cord sections transfected with the gfp gene driven by the ppe promoter  <cit> .

peripheral nerve injury and tissue inflammation often induce a state of abnormal pain known as neuropathic pain, which includes hyperalgesia and allodynia  <cit> . chronic constriction injury  of the sciatic nerve increases met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the spinal cord  <cit> . increases in enkephalin have also been described in spinal cord injury  <cit> , polyarthritis  <cit> , electrical stimulation  <cit> , and various other preparations, using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry to detect changes in enkephalin. to develop a new, more efficient, tool for the analysis of enkephalin promoter activity and characterization of enkephalinergic neurons, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome  transgenic mouse in which enhanced green fluorescent protein  is expressed in enkephalinergic neurons under the control of the ppe gene  promoter.

RESULTS
egfp expression and endogenous enkephalin expression
to assess the correlation of egfp fluorescence with endogenous enkephalin expression in sdh, we performed double immunostaining with anti-egfp and anti-enkephalin antibodies. figure  <dig> shows representative double-staining immunohistochemical images for egfp and enkephalin. in  <dig> sections randomly selected from three mice, we determined that, of the  <dig> lamina ii neurons immunostained for egfp,  <dig>  were also immunolabeled for enkephalin. in the same  <dig> sections,  <dig> lamina ii neurons were immunostained for enkephalin, and  <dig>  were immunolabeled for egfp.

increased number of egfp-positive neurons in the presence of forskolin
the expression of enkephalin is controlled by camp, owing to the camp-responsive elements contained within the ppe promoter  <cit> . we examined whether our penk1-egfp bac transgenic mouse was useful for analyzing the effect of forskolin, an activator of ac, on the ppe promoter. to evaluate the effect of forskolin treatment, transverse spinal sections were exposed to a  <dig> minutes bath application of forskolin, and the number of egfp-positive neurons was counted at 5-minute intervals. the number of egfp-positive neurons in sections significantly increased compared to the control when forskolin was added to the krebs solution, while the number of control  decreased gradually with fading of egfp fluorescence upon exposure to ultraviolet  light, as illustrated in figure 2c. the effect of forskolin was statistically significant  in a comparison between forskolin treatment  and the control . percentage increase in the ratio of the number of egfp-positive neurons with forskolin treatment to the number of control neurons was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % after  <dig> h of forskolin treatment . this increase in egfp-positive neurons may reflect an increase in the expression level of enkephalin above the detection threshold in neurons with relatively low basal enkephalin levels or alternatively, de novo enkephalin expression in neuron populations.

increased number of egfp-positive neurons in partial sciatic nerve ligations
met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the spinal cord dorsal horn increases after sciatic nerve ligation  <cit> . to confirm whether our bac transgenic mouse is useful for analyzing the effect of sciatic nerve ligation on enkephalin expression, the number of egfp-positive neurons on the sciatic nerve-ligated  side was compared with the number on the nonligated  side in spinal sections. the number of egfp-positive neurons significantly increased in ipsilateral compared with contralateral . this result is consistent with a previous report  <cit> .

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis of the expression of glutamate decarboxylase  <dig> and 5-ht <dig> receptor mrnas in egfp-positive neurons
pcr products of glutamate decarboxylase  <dig>  and 5-ht <dig> receptor were detected in egfp-positive neurons in sdh . the results of single-neuron rt-pcr indicated that gad <dig>  and 5-ht <dig> receptors  were co-expressed in the somatodendritic regions of the enkephalinergic neurons in sdh.

discussion
distribution of enkephalinergic neurons in sdh
we visualized presumptive enkephalinergic neurons in the spinal cord sections by generating a bac transgenic mouse in which egfp is expressed in enkephalinergic neurons under the control of the penk <dig> promoter. immunohistochemical investigations showed that enkephalinergic neurons were located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, with the highest density in the superficial laminae, thus suggesting egfp-positive neurons are enkephalinergic. this distribution in the mouse model is similar to that described previously in rat and cat models  <cit> .

co-expression of enkephalin, gad <dig>  and 5-ht <dig> receptor mrnas in interneurons in sdh
single-neuron rt-pcr analysis showed that most egfp-positive neurons expressed gad <dig> mrnas and that some expressed 5-ht <dig> receptor mrnas. we previously reported that enkephalinergic neurons express 5-ht <dig> receptors in sdh  <cit>  and that activation of 5-ht <dig> receptors facilitates gaba release from some interneurons in sdh  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that the release of enkephalin or the release of both enkephalin and gaba from some egfp-positive neurons is facilitated by activation of 5-ht <dig> receptors.

changes in enkephalin expression induced by various treatments as models of chronic pain in the spinal cord
analyses of the expression of enkephalin in the spinal cord during chronic inflammation have been previously reported in a number of models. increases in ppe mrna-labeled neurons in sdh have been reported in a number of injury model studies, including intraspinal microinjection of quisqualic acid to induce excitotoxic spinal cord injury  <cit> , intraplantar injection of lambda carrageenan to induce hindpaw inflammation  <cit> , and intradermal injection of heat-killed mycobacterium butyricum to induce adjuvant arthritis  <cit> . in contrast to these inflammatory forms of chronic pain induced by various injections, there was no significant change in the spinal cord expression of enkephalin after sciatic nerve crush  <cit>  or after complete transection of the sciatic nerve  <cit> .

the impact of cci, which produces a painful neuropathy of the sciatic nerve, is less clear. quantification of immunohistochemical staining in the spinal cord dorsal horn showed an increase in met-enkephalin  <cit> . on the other hand, no significant alteration in the level of ppe mrna was detected by rna blot analysis after cci  <cit> . these reports suggest that even in the same chronic pain model, detection of enkephalin expression levels depend on the method of analysis used. finally, in contrast to the results we report here, partial ligation of the sciatic nerve has been reported to produce a non-significant but moderate increase in enkephalin mrna expression, as detected by in situ hybridization  <cit> . a possible explanation for these conflicting results is that the transgenic egfp approach taken in our study is more sensitive than the in situ hybridization method.

possible causes for increased number of egfp-positive neuron observed in sciatic nerve ligation or forskolin treatment
there are the two explanations for the increased number of egfp-positive neurons: elevated expression of egfp  above the detection threshold or new expression of egfp  in populations that were previously egfp-negative. the increased number of egfp-positive neurons by sciatic nerve ligation or forskolin treatment may have resulted from both mechanisms, but in either case, it is impossible to determine which mechanism in this study. while our data does not provide direct evidence of a linear and homogeneous relationship between increased egfp and enkephalin, this issue might be addressed in a comparison of the intensity of egfp signal in neurons with low versus high enkephalin levels. if the comparison shows a precise relationship between increased egfp and enkephalin, it might be possible to quantify how many treatments increase the number of enkephalinergic neurons and how much the expression level of enkephalin in each cell is increased.

other egfp-transgenics used as tools in spinal dorsal cord studies
zeilhofer et al. generated bac transgenic mice that express egfp specifically in glycinergic neurons under the control of the glycine transporter glyt <dig> promoter  <cit> . the bac transgenic mice were used to measure the change in the number of spinal glycinergic neurons in cci model of neuropathic pain  <cit> . the report suggests that loss of glycinergic neurons is not necessary for the development of pathological nociceptive behavior in the cci model. gabaergic neurons containing enkephalin do not show glycine-like immunoreactivity  <cit> . the mechanism underlying the loss of spinal gabaergic neurons in neuropathic pain is still controversial, but this may be due to a combination of loss of neurons coexpressing gaba and glycine, and an increase in neurons coexpressing gaba and enkephalin.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we generated bac transgenic mice expressing egfp in enkephalinergic neurons. these mice appear to be a feasible option for identifying enkephalinergic neurons under in vitro conditions in animal models of persistent pain . in addition, if egfp is shown to have a linear relationship with enkephalin levels, this transgenic mouse may prove useful as an assay of enkephalin expression levels under various conditions both in vitro and in vivo. the physiological characterization of sdh neurons identified as enkephalinergic neurons would help elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying nociceptive modulation in the spinal dorsal horn.
