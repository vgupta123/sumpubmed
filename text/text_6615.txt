BACKGROUND
mycoviruses  are widespread in all major fungal groups and most of these cause little or no obvious symptoms in their fungal hosts. current studies on mycoviruses are mainly focused on those of economically important fungi that are typically phytopathogenic fungi. these studies aim to develop mycoviruses as biocontrol agents to combat fungal diseases and exploit them as tools to explore the physiology of their fungal hosts  <cit> . the recent discoveries of two novel mycoviruses from the white mold fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum, one rna virus related to rubi-like viruses of positive-strand rna viruses  <cit>  and another circular single-stranded  dna virus related to plant geminiviruses  <cit> , have potentially significant implications for understanding the origin and evolution of related viral lineages. given that mycoviruses represent essential evolutionary lineage of viruses from one of three kingdoms , the discovery of novel mycoviruses may not only expand our knowledge of viral diversity and global ecology, but also helps shed light on the evolutionary relationships of viruses.

the majority of known mycoviruses has rigid particles and double-stranded  rna genomes and are now classified, based on the number of genome segments, into four families: chrysoviridae, partitiviridae, reoviridae, and totiviridae  <cit> . members of family totiviridae have monopartite dsrna genomes coding for a capsid protein  and an rna-dependent rna polymerase . the genomes of members in the families, partitiviridae, chrysoviridae and reoviridae comprise two, four and eleven/twelve segments, respectively. in addition, viruses in the family endornaviridae, which lack true virions, are currently classified as dsrna viruses by ictv, although there is some evidence to suggest that they have evolved from alpha-like viruses of positive strand rna viruses. beside fungi, viruses in these families also infect other organisms.

more recently, several monopartite dsrna viruses with evolutionary links between totiviruses and partitiviruses were isolated from plants  <cit> . furthermore, a novel bipartite dsrna mycovirus phylogenetically distantly related to totiviruses and chrysoviruses was reported from the white root rot fungus rosellinia necatrix  <cit> . these viruses represent new evolutionary lineages of dsrna viruses, implying that dsrna viruses are more diverse than previously recognized. although an increasing number of complete genomic sequences of viruses have been reported, the evolution of these diverse dsrna viruses remains to be clarified.

horizontal gene transfer  between different viruses is important in virus evolution. the occurrence of hgt is dependent on recombination or reassortment and is capable of generating impressive genetic diversity. while hgt is commonly found in retroviruses, dna viruses and positive-sense rna viruses  <cit> , it has only rarely been shown to occur in negative-sense rna viruses and dsrna viruses  <cit> . in dsrna viruses, there are only some sporadic reports of intra-species hgt events that occur in rotaviruses  <cit>  and birnaviruses  <cit> . to date no evidence has been reported of inter-species hgt in dsrna viruses.

here, we carried out molecular cloning and complete genomic sequencing of two novel dsrna viruses from s. sclerotiorum strain sunf-m, one is monopartite and the other is bipartite. we then performed genome sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses involving these two viruses and other related known dsrna viruses in order to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of relevant dsrna viruses. moreover, we provided evidence based on sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis that cross-family hgt events may have occurred between dsrna viruses from different families.

RESULTS
discovery and complete genomic sequencing of dsrna in s. sclerotiorum sunf-m
s. sclerotium strain sunf-m, which was originally isolated from a sclerotium on a diseased sunflower plant , was a normal wild-type strain in colony morphology and virulence. agarose gel electrophoresis of dsrna isolated from mycelial extracts of strain sunf-m revealed the presence of three dsrna bands, termed l-, m- and s-dsrna respectively . the largest l-dsrna was generally more abundant and migrated slightly slower than the m-dsrna.

the l-dsrna was purified from agarose gel with a gel extraction kit, and then subjected to cdna synthesis, pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing as described before  <cit> . computer-assisted sequence assembly showed that the full-length of l-dsrna cdna is 9124 bp in length that lacked a poly  tail at its 3′-end. northern blot hybridization confirmed that the sequence was derived from the l-dsrna .

molecular cloning and sequencing of the smallest s-dsrna was also carried out and the complete nucleotide sequence was determined. sequencing and northern hybridization analysis revealed that the s-dsrna band was actually a doublet consisting of two co-migrating dsrna segments and thereby the resulting s-dsrna band was designated as s- <dig> and s- <dig> dsrna, which are 1856 bp and 1783 bp in length, excluding the poly  tail, respectively .

characterization of the l-dsrna
the genomic organization of l-dsrna revealed that it contains two large open reading frames : orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  in different frames on the genomic plus strand. the l-dsrna has a long 5′-utr of 1088 bp, but relatively short 3-utr of 48 bp . orf <dig> potentially encodes a  <dig> amino acid  protein with a predicted molecular mass of 144 kda. a sequence search with blastp showed that it shares significant sequence similarity  with only the hypothetical proteins of three unclassified dsrna viruses: grapevine associated totivirus- <dig>   <cit> , fusarium graminearum dsrna mycovirus- <dig>   <cit>  and phlebiopsis gigantea mycovirus dsrna  <dig>   <cit>  in the databases. although a search of conserved domain database  revealed a significant match  with a partial consensus sequence of the phosphoheptose isomerase  , the function of orf <dig> protein is unclear.

orf <dig> potentially encodes a 1338-aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. blastp searches showed that this protein was most closely related  to the putative rdrps of the same three viruses mentioned above as well as another unclassified dsrna virus diplodia scrobiculata rna virus  <dig> . in addition, this protein also shares significant sequence similarity with rdrps of members of the families totiviridae and chrysoviridae. cdd searches and multiple protein alignment confirmed that orf2-encoded protein contained a conserved viral rdrp domain  with eight conserved motifs characteristic of the rdrps in dsrna viruses .

intriguingly, a search of cdd revealed that a region of l-dsrna orf <dig> downstream of the rdrp domain shared significant sequence similarity  with a consensus sequence of the phytoreo_s <dig> domain  . the phytoreo_s <dig> domain is characteristic of a family consisting of several phytoreovirus s <dig> proteins known to be viral core proteins with nucleic acid binding activities. the phytoreovirus s <dig> domain has also been found in fgv- <dig>  <cit> , chrysovirus penicillium chrysogenum virus   <cit>  as well as other viruses .

the orf <dig> is likely expressed via a − <dig> frameshift mechanism as a fusion protein with orf1-encoded protein. a heptanucleotide sequence , located in a stretch in-frame with orf <dig> stop codon region  and upstream of orf <dig> start codon, was identified as a putative shifty heptamer motif that could facilitate ribosomal frameshifting . in addition, a pseudoknot structure that facilitates pausing of the translating ribosome and increasing the frequency of frameshifting  <cit>  was also found immediately downstream of the shifty heptamer  . similar genomic organization and expression strategy are characteristic of some members of the family totiviridae. therefore, the results presented in this section suggest that l-dsrna probably represented a novel dsrna mycovirus infecting s. sclerotiorum strain sunf-m. this virus was hence named as sclerotinia sclerotiorum nonsegmented virus l .

characterization of the s-dsrna
both s- <dig>  and s- <dig> dsrna  contain a single orf on their plus-stranded rna and share conserved sequences in their 5′-utrs . the s- <dig> and s- <dig> dsrnas potentially encode proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> aa, respectively. blastp searches showed that the s- <dig> protein had highest sequence similarity  to the putative rdrp of flammulina velutipes isometric virus  and the s- <dig> protein shared highest sequence similarity  with the putative cp of rosellinia necatrix partitivirus  <dig> . both of these two viruses are members of family partitiviridae. furthermore, cdd database searches and multiple protein alignment revealed that the s- <dig> protein contained the consensus motifs of partitivirus rdrps  . these results suggest that s-dsrna is a new member of family partitiviridae infecting s. sclerotiorum sunf-m and was named as sclerotinia sclerotiorum partitivirus s .

the diverse monopartite lineages of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses
to elucidate the evolution of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses including ssnsv-l and sspv-s, we compared the genome structures and performed phylogenetic analyses for representative members of the families chrysoviridae, partitiviridae and totiviridae as well as other unclassified dsrna viruses . the analyses revealed that there are diverse evolutionary lineages in the known mycovirus-related dsrna viruses including at least ten monopartite, three bipartite, one tripartite and three quadripartite lineages.

the monopartite dsrna family totiviridae is not a monophyletic group since it comprises five distant evolutionary lineages: glv-like, imnv-like, victorivirus-like, scv l-like, and umv-h <dig> . in addition, there were variations in genome structures for several members compared with typical members  of the family totiviridae . for example, the genome of piscine myocarditis virus al v- <dig>  contains an extra orf at its 3′-terminal other than the cp and rdrp orfs  <cit>  ; this is not known to occur in other totiviruses. in addition, contrary to typical totiviruses, the rdrp orf of glomus sp. rf <dig> medium virus  is located at the 5′ terminal half of the genome upstream of cp orf .

in addition to the five totiviral lineages, the unclassified monopartite dsrna viruses consist of five other evolutionary lineages: amalgamaviridae, citv-1-like, pgrv-1-like, ssnsv-l-like, and nrv-l <dig>  which are genetically distantly related to each other. the southern tomato virus  and three other related viruses isolated from plants  <cit>  clustered together and were distantly related to totiviruses. their genomes are shorter than those of totiviruses and no typical virions are associated with them. a new family, amalgamaviridae, has been proposed to accommodate these four viruses  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis revealed that a yeast virus zygosaccharomyces bailii virus z  was also likely to be the member of this proposed family. the ssnsv-l-like lineage contained ssnsv-l and four other mycoviruses . they have similar genome structures with typical members of the family totiviridae but their genomes  are much larger than those of known totiviruses . it has been reported that the pgrv- <dig> and fgv- <dig> possibly do not form true virions  <cit> . it remains to be determined if ssnsv-l has a capsid. the citv-1-like lineage included two insect viruses and an unclassified plant virus. despite the similarity in genome organization with members of the family totiviridae, their genomes  were slightly larger than those of typical totiviruses   and might not assemble in conventional virions  <cit> . the p. gigantean mycovirus dsrna  <dig> -like lineage consists of three large monopartite dsrna viruses and no viral particles have been reported in association with infections by pgrv- <dig>  <cit> . a mycovirus nectria radicicola virus l <dig>  is most closely related to partitiviruses and has been assigned as an unclassified member of the family partitiviridae in database. however, its genome is 6 kb in length  <cit> , clearly suggesting that it is not likely to be a partitivirus. hence, it may represent a novel group of monopartite dsrna viruses.

the diverse bipartite lineages of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses
the family partitiviridae generally consists of viruses with bipartite genomes comprising two dsrna segments. all members of this family clustered together in the phylogenetic tree and could be further separated into four clades: clade i-iv . the recently isolated mycovirus rosellinia necatrix megabirnavirus  <dig> , a member of the proposed family megabirnaviridae <cit>  was most closely related to the pgrv-1-like monopartite lineage , but it has a bipartite genome encapsidated in isometric virions. therefore, it may represent a novel bipartite evolutionary lineage of dsrna viruses. more recently, a novel bipartite dsrna mycovirus botrytis porri rna virus  <dig>  was isolated from botrytis porri that belongs to a separate clade distinct from those of other known rna mycoviruses  <cit> . interestingly, the bprv1-related bipartite dsrna virus was also isolated from s. sclerotiorum in our lab . these results indicated that there are diverse evolutionary lineages of bipartite dsrna viruses in nature.

the tripartite lineage of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses
although the typical patitiviruses have two genome segments, some viruses in clade iv harbor three segments, two of which encoded cps. these cps formed two sister groups in the cp tree and the two cps in each virus clustered within different groups , suggesting that a possible duplication event occurred before the divergence of these viruses. because the genomes of many viruses in the clade iv were not completely sequenced, it is not yet known whether all members of this clade possess two cp genes.

the diverse quadripartite lineages of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses
currently, ictv recognizes six viruses as members or probable members in the family chrysoviridae <cit>  . phylogenetic analysis revealed that other related viruses might also be members of this family . the extended family is a monophyletic group and can be further divided into two subgroups: clade i and clade ii. members of clade ii have only  <dig> genome segments whereas members of clade i generally have more than four segments. at present, none of clade i viruses is recognized as member or probable member of the genus chrysovirus. it is worth noting that aspergillus mycovirus  <dig>  has been incorrectly assigned by the genbank as an unclassified member of the family totiviridae in database. four dsrna segments have been shown to be associated with this virus  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that it is probably a member of chrysoviridae.

like members of the family chrysoviridaealternaria alternate dsrna mycovirus   <cit>  and aspergillus mycovirus  <dig>  have four genomic dsrna segments that are encapsidated in isometric virions. however, each genomic segment has a 3′-poly  tail, which is not found in chrysoviruses. in addition, the dsrna  <dig> segments of these two viruses  are much shorter than those of chrysoviruses  . furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that these two viruses are distantly related to chrysoviruses . these results suggest that the two viruses are members of a novel lineage of quadripartite dsrna viruses.

rosellinia necatrix quadrivirus  <dig> , a novel dsrna virus, has recently been reported from rosellinia necatrix <cit> . its genome encompasses four segments but all of which are much larger than those of chrysoviruses . interestingly, the genome of amasya cherry disease-associated mycovirus  also encompasses four segments but two of which putatively encode rdrps that are related to each other  <cit>  and which cluster with rnqv <dig> in the phylogenetic tree . it has been suggested that the two rdrps of acdav might derive from two related viruses  <cit> . although rnqv <dig> and acdav clustered within the totiviral clade , the feature of multipartite genome indicated that they represented a new lineage of quadripartite dsrna viruses. based on the properties of rnqv <dig>  a new family quadriviridae has been proposed  <cit> .

possible origin of multipartite dsrna viral lineages
from both phylogenetic trees and network, we can delineate different lineages of multipartite dsrna viruses: aarv-like, rnqv1-like, rnmbv <dig> and chrysoviruses. these are generally most closely related to certain monopartite dsrna viruses and the monopartite viruses were branching deeply at the base of the multipartite viral lineages. these results suggest that multipartite dsrna viruses likely evolved from different monopartite dsrna viruses. the extra segments in monopartite dsrna viruses could be generated through gene acquisition  and/or genome separation . in addition, phylogenetic analysis places the nrv-l <dig> at the base of partitiviral clade iii , raising the possibility that the ancestor of clade iii partitiviruses possibly originated from nrv-l1-like monopartite viruses. this finding raised our awareness of the possibility that the partitiviruses in the three other clades probably also evolved from different monopartite dsrna viruses that have yet to be discovered. therefore, generation of multipartite genomes may be an important macroevolutionary mechanism in dsrna viruses.

taxonomy of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses
in this study, genome comparisons and phylogenetic analyses revealed that at least  <dig> monopartite,  <dig> bipartite,  <dig> tripartite and  <dig> quadripartite lineages of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses are known. among these, some lineages have been considered as members or tentative members of the families, totiviridae, partitiviridae and chrysoviridae. however, the taxonomy of viruses belonging to the other evolutionary lineages has yet to be considered. because of differences in genome organization, particle morphology and phylogeny from members of these three families, the establishment of new virus families or new genera is warranted to accommodate the unclassified dsrna viral lineages.

current taxonomy of genera in the family partitiviridae is based on viral hosts . our phylogenetic analysis, however, shown that partitiviral clade i and ii consisted of a mosaic of plant partitiviruses  and fungal partitiviruses . therefore, the host taxon is not a distinguishing character and it does not reflect the true evolutionary relationships of viruses. because classification of viruses based on phylogeny not only helps to understand the evolution of viruses but also facilitates the prediction of new virus emergence. therefore, we propose the establishment of four new genera to reflect the four clades in family partitiviridae.

it has been considered that dsrna viruses are polyphyletic and have originated from different lineages of positive-strand rna viruses  <cit> . the families partitiviridae and totiviridae have been suggested to belong to the picorna-like superfamily  <cit> . our study revealed that members of the family chrysoviridae and other diverse evolutionary lineages of mycovirus-related dsrna viruses are closely related to totiviruses and partitiviruses. therefore, these viral lineages may also be included in this expanded superfamily, remarkably expanding the known diversity of the picorna-like viruses.

identification of ‘phytoreo s <dig> domain’
the s <dig> protein domain is thought to be characteristic of members of the genus phytoreovirus in family reoviridae. the finding that s <dig> domain homologs occur in ssnsv-l, fgv- <dig> and pcv raised our interest in exploring whether other viruses also have s <dig> domain homologs. for this purpose, we performed psi-blast searches using the s <dig> domain sequences of these three viruses and plant phytoreoviruses as seed sequences against ncbi nr database. the results showed that homologs of s <dig> domain are widely distributed in diverse dsrna viral lineages .

athe positions of phytoreovirus s <dig> domain in proteins for alignment and phylogenetic analysis were indicated.

the s <dig> domain was found in all known chrysoviruses. interestingly, it occurs in both rdrp and p <dig> proteins of clade ii chrysoviruses , but only found in the rdrps of clade i chrysoviruses. in fact, the 5′-terminal regions of rdrps in clade ii chrysoviruses are homologous with those of their p3/p <dig> proteins  <cit>  . the s <dig> domain is located in these 5′-terminal homologous regions. the homology between rdrp and other proteins was not found in clade i chrysoviruses.

in addition to four members in genus phytoreovirus, we also found that the s <dig> protein  of scylla serrata reovirus sz- <dig>   <cit> , a member of a proposed new genus in the family reoviridae, contains an s <dig> domain homolog at its 3′-terminal. this domain was also identified in ssnsv-l-related mycoviruses fgv- <dig>  dsrv- <dig> and pgrv- <dig> as well as in another unclassified monopartite dsrna virus, pgrv- <dig>  moreover, s <dig> domain homologs were also found in the cp protein of the totivirus gmrv-rf <dig> and the polyproteins of three endornaviruses.

compared with those of phytoreoviruses, the s <dig> domain in other viruses contains only partial sequence of the s <dig> domain. multiple alignment of the s <dig> domain revealed that the sequences were likely to be conserved in diverse dsrna viral lineages . the function of this domain in these non-phytoreoviruses is not known. it will be of interest to determine whether it plays a role in viral rna binding and packaging.

evolution of ‘phytoreo s <dig> domain’ in diverse viral lineages
comparison of the domain arrangement in relevant viral proteins shows that the s <dig> domain is located downstream of the rdrp domain in ssnsv-l, fgv- <dig>  dsrv- <dig> and pgrv- <dig>  however, the s <dig> domain resides upstream of the rdrp domain in endornaviruses, chrysoviruses and pgrv- <dig> . in addition, this domain is also found in other proteins, such as the cp of gmrv-rf <dig> and the guanylyltransferase of ssrev-sz. these results suggest that multiple recombination events may have occurred among different viral domains or proteins.

to elucidate the possible evolution of the s <dig> domain homologs, we constructed phylogenetic tree and network for those from different viral lineages . the s <dig> domains from five members of phytoreovirus clustered together and formed a distinct clade in both tree and neighbor-net. all of these from chrysoviruses also clustered together. the phylogeny relationships of the p3/p <dig> of clade ii chrysoviruses were consistent with those of their rdrps, suggesting that the ancestor of clade ii chrysoviruses also possessed the s <dig> domain in its rdrp and p3/p <dig>  considering that the branches of p3/p <dig> proteins were located at the base of chrysoviruses clade and that the 5′-terminal regions were homologous between rdrps and p3/p4s , it is most likely that the s <dig> domains were firstly obtained by the p3/p <dig> proteins of the ancestral clade ii chrysoviruses and then transferred to the rdrp proteins by recombination during evolution. given the close relationships in the neighbor-net , the s <dig> domains of clade i chrysoviruses may have been acquired by their progenitor from those in rdrps of the ancestor of clade i chrysoviruses via inter-species hgts.

some viruses from unrelated families constituted the third clade. the positions of their s <dig> domains were different . this suggests that hgts may have occurred among these distant viruses. the closely related four unclassified mycoviruses ssnsv-l, fgv- <dig>  dsrv- <dig> and pgrv- <dig> cluster together and the arrangement of their s <dig> and rdrp domains were also similar, suggesting that the ancestor of these four viruses may have contained the s <dig> domain. interestingly, pgrv- <dig> and pgrv- <dig> that coinfect one fungal strain clustered together but the positions of their s <dig> domains were different, suggesting that hgt between these two viruses may have occurred. similarly, the endornavirus helicobasidium mompa endornavirus  <dig>   <cit>  possibly acquired its s <dig> domain from the dsrv-1-like virus via hgt.

dsrna viruses represent an extremely divergent group. although rdrps are the most highly conserved proteins among rna viruses, there is little primary-sequence similarity among those encoded by dsrna viruses from different genera, even those belonging to the same family  <cit> . for example, the rdrps from several distinct genera in the family reoviridae show only 10–20% amino acid identity  <cit> . so far, the phylogenetic relationship of members of reoviridae with viruses in other families or genera is not clear. therefore, the obvious conservation of s <dig> domain in diverse dsrna viral lineages even from different families implies that it is not likely to be the results of vertical inheritance. furthermore, the s <dig> domain only occurred in certain viruses of a given viral group; their phylogenies were not consistent with those of rdrps. for example, only three members of the family endornaviridae have the s <dig> domains, and these did not cluster together in s <dig> domain tree . in addition, the s <dig> domains in the non-phytoreoviruses are truncated and have different domain arrangement with rdrps . given these facts, the s <dig> domain sequences in non-phytoreoviruses were most likely acquired from ancestral phytoreoviruses and then horizontally transferred repeatedly among these diverse dsrna viral lineages. this suggests that hgt between different virus species is an important macroevolutionary mechanism in dsrna viruses.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report the molecular properties of two novel mycoviruses from s. sclerotiorum strain sunf-m. one is a monopartite virus representing a distinct evolutionary lineage of dsrna viruses and the other is a bipartite virus, a new member of the family partitiviridae. comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and genome comparisons revealed that there are at least ten monopartite, three bipartite, one tripartite and three quadripartite lineages in the known mycovirus-related dsrna viruses and those multipartite lineages possibly evolved from different monopartite dsrna viruses. moreover, we found that homologs of phytoreo_s <dig> domain are widely distributed in diverse non-phytoreovirus lineages, including, chrysoviruses, endornaviruses as well as some unclassified dsrna mycoviruses. we further provided convincing evidence that multiple hgt events may have occurred among dsrna viruses from different families. our study provides an insight into the phylogeny and evolution of dsrna viruses and reveals that hgt between different viruses and generation of multipartite genomes are important macroevolutionary mechanisms in dsrna viruses.
