BACKGROUND
protein arginine methylation is a post-translational modification commonly found in nucleic acid-binding proteins [reviewed in  <cit> . this modification is catalyzed by a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes called protein arginine methyltransferases . prmts can be classified into four major classes depending on the type of methylarginine generated by the enzyme. type i, ii, and iii prmts can all catalyze monomethylation and generate monomethylarginine  on a guanidinum nitrogen of arginine residues in proteins. type i prmts then catalyze the formation of asymmetric dimethylarginine  and type ii prmts, symmetric dimethylarginine . type iii can only catalyze monomethylarginine while the type iv enzyme, which has only been described in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , catalyzes monomethylation of the delta nitrogen atom of the arginine residue. currently, eleven prmt family members have been identified in the metazoans, with prmt <dig>  and prmt <dig>  being the most conserved members of the prmt family across the eukaryotic spectrum reviewed in  <cit> .

hmt <dig>  has been identified as the major type i prmt in the budding yeast s. cerevisiae and is the functional homolog of mammalian prmt <dig>  <cit> . a number of substrates have been identified for hmt <dig> and knowledge of these substrates’ biological functions has helped infer hmt1’s role as a regulator during various steps in gene expression. these substrates include histones h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  <cit> , mrna export factors npl <dig>  <cit>  and yra <dig>  <cit> , pre-mrna splicing factors snp <dig>  <cit> , 3’-end processing factors hrp <dig>  <cit>  and nab <dig>  <cit> , and the nucleolar proteins nop <dig>  nsr <dig>  and gar <dig>  <cit> . functional studies have shown that yeast mutants lacking hmt <dig> display compromised intracellular protein trafficking, aberrant messenger ribonucleoprotein particle  formation and defective silent chromatin formation  <cit> . the defects seen in the silent chromatin formation in hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants may be due to a change in the recruitment of other histone deacetylases to these regions, thereby altering the histone modification status at such regions  <cit> . moreover, recent data from large-scale, synthetic genetic array  experiments reveal new, potential functions for hmt <dig> in a cell  <cit> .

genome-wide location analysis is a powerful method that allows one to comprehensively identify direct and indirect protein-nucleic acid interactions across a specific genome in vivo, by combining the method of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays reviewed in  <cit> . for yeast, this approach has been utilized to study both dna- and rna-binding proteins  <cit> . for example, genome-wide location analyses of basal transcription factors have provided important information on the marking of promoter regions within a eukaryotic transcription circuit  <cit> . additionally, the ability to use antibodies directed against specific histone modifications has enabled the creation of chromatin signature maps marking promoters that are either active or repressed, as well as other genome elements such as enhancers and transcribed regions reviewed in  <cit> . thus, this approach has helped answer important questions about where in the genome a protein physically interacts and can unravel critical details of gene regulation within a cell.

in this study, we have comprehensively mapped the genome-wide occupancy for hmt <dig> using nimblegen high-resolution tiling microarrays. based on the profile of genomic features bound by hmt <dig>  we found that hmt1-binding sites are located at a number of orfs as well as noncoding rna  genes such as trna and snorna genes. to probe the potential functional consequence of hmt1-occupancy at trna genes, we assayed the steady-state levels of various trnas in hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants and found their levels to be elevated when compared to wild-type cells. this positive change in the trna abundance in the hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants is likely due to a changed transcriptional output by rna polymerase iii  rather than a change in the trna maturation process. lastly, coimmunoprecipitation experiments show an association between hmt <dig> and the tfiiib component bdp <dig>  which identifies a potential molecular link by which hmt <dig> is recruited to trna genes. together, these results provide a global view for hmt <dig> function within the cell and reveal a novel role for hmt <dig> in regulating trna biogenesis.

RESULTS
yeast genomic features bound by hmt1
hmt <dig> has been previously shown to be cotranscriptionally recruited to genes  <cit>  and hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants display decreased levels of dimethylated arginine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  at silent chromatin regions  <cit> . together, these observations demonstrate the significance of hmt1’s interaction with the genome in facilitating its biological roles within a cell. while we have previously carried out genome-wide location analysis for hmt <dig> in the past  <cit> , that experiment used cdna microarrays. thus, there remains a lack of knowledge with respect to other genomic features that hmt <dig> may interact with, such as autonomous replicating sequences  or non-coding rna  genes, which are not represented on the cdna microarray platforms. to address this gap in knowledge for hmt1’s association with the genome, we have comprehensively mapped the genome-wide occupancy of hmt <dig> using nimblegen’s high-resolution yeast tiling microarrays. these microarrays gave us the resolution and coverage needed for fully assess hmt1’s genome-wide occupancy. after acquiring the data, acme peak finding was used to analyze individual microarray data sets. we then used custom perl scripts to integrate our biological triplicate datasets and to identify hmt1-binding sites. using this information, we were able to identify genomic features that are enriched for hmt1-binding sites in our data sets and extracted peak sequences for analyses such as motif discovery.

overall, a total of  <dig> hmt <dig> binding sites  were found to have passed the cutoff criteria for statistical significance . approximately 71% of these binding sites map to regions within or proximal to an annotated orf  . however, this represents only 10% of all orfs within the genome . using gene ontology enrichment analysis  <cit> , we found that orfs bound by hmt <dig> are enriched for genes involved in translation  and in rrna maturation pathways . hmt1-binding sites also map to a number of ncrna genes, including trnas, snrnas, and snornas, as well as arss . the percentage of total features within the yeast genome that are bound by hmt <dig> was calculated for each of the annotated genomic element classes . this analysis revealed that hmt <dig> binds to approximately 40% of all nuclear-encoded trna genes, as well as nearly 35% of all snornas.

to validate our high-resolution chip-chip data of hmt <dig>  we used directed chip  to verify a number of the identified binding sites. in each case, we have identified hmt <dig> enrichment at the regions tested . these features include specific regions within a few orfs and ncrna genes. as a negative control, we measured hmt <dig> enrichment at regions not found in our hmt1-bound dataset, such as tra <dig> and sps <dig> . the results from our chip validation experiments provide additional confidence that hmt <dig> binds a number of genomic features previously unknown, especially trna genes.

characteristics of hmt1-binding across orfs
previously, we have shown that hmt <dig> is cotranscriptionally recruited to the actively transcribing gene gal <dig>  with a preference at the 5’-end to the middle of the gal <dig> orf  <cit> . to examine the relationship between hmt <dig> occupancy and gene expression, we assigned orf-encoding genes to three different classes based on their transcriptional frequency  <cit> . we generated a baseline hmt <dig> signal for all genes that fall under each of the three different classes as described previously  <cit>  , then we plotted the average hmt1-enrichment for the set of orfs that we classified as bound by our binding site annotations . for highly transcribed genes , such as those involved in translation or ribosomal protein genes, there is an obvious enrichment of hmt <dig> from the 5’-end to the middle of these highly transcribed genes . this occupancy trend is similar to what we had previously observed for hmt <dig> on the gal <dig> gene  <cit> . to our surprise, we observed a different trend for hmt <dig> occupancy across orfs with medium and low transcriptional rates . in general, hmt <dig> occupancy is evenly distributed across an orf within these two transcriptional classes, with the exception of a slightly higher occupancy at the 3’-end of these orfs. this is more apparent for the gene class with medium transcriptional frequency  .

hmt <dig> methylates arginine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  in vitro <cit>  and mutants lacking hmt <dig> or its catalytic activities display decreased levels of dimethylated h4r <dig> at silent chromatin regions  <cit> . since mutants lacking hmt <dig> do not show a significant decrease in bulk dimethylated h4r <dig>  <cit> , it is possible that hmt1’s effects on chromatin may only occur within a specific chromosomal context, such as those in the silent chromatin regions. nevertheless, prmt <dig> -catalyzed h4r <dig> methylation has been demonstrated as a key, initial histone modification that is important for subsequent histone modifications  <cit> . as such, we wanted to determine if hmt1-bound orfs displayed enrichment or depletion for specific histone modifications. using chromatindb, we calculated the enrichment or depletion of  <dig> different histone modifications and the five core histones for the hmt1-bound orfs   <cit> . chromatindb calculates the enrichment/depletion in gene bodies as well as promoter regions across the yeast genome  <cit> . analysis of the hmt1-bound genes revealed that promoter regions were enriched for h3k36me <dig> and pan-h <dig> acetylation, while being depleted for h3/h <dig> occupancy . h3k4me <dig>  pan-h <dig> acetylation, h3k56ac, and h2a.z occupancy are depleted, and h3k36me <dig> is enriched across gene bodies .

to assess whether hmt <dig> regulates the modification of histones based on our chromatindb analysis, we performed directed chip using antibodies against pan-acetyl h <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in wild-type and hmt1-null cells to measure the levels of these modifications in orf-gene bodies since we find the majority of hmt <dig> enrichment here . we tested the orfs that were bound by hmt <dig> and representative of the histone modification trend  based on the database analysis. with respect to pan-acetyl h <dig>  we do not observe any changes in the level between wild-type and hmt1-null cells . when we compared the directed chip results for h3k36me <dig> between wild-type and hmt1-null cells, we found the majority of the orfs we tested do not change, but there was a slight increase in two loci – bet <dig> and rps13a . these results suggest that the absence  or presence  of these histone modifications may regulate the recruitment of hmt <dig> as opposed to hmt <dig> regulating their levels in orf gene bodies.

analysis of hmt1-bound sequences for motif discovery
because we were able to obtain detailed sequence-specific information from the probes used in our high-resolution microarray, we applied a number of motif finding algorithms  to determine whether there exists a motif within the hmt <dig> binding sites. while our analyses revealed enriched motifs, none of these appear to be of obvious biological significance . this was not surprising to us, as hmt <dig> has no reported dna binding activity and is likely to associate within the proximity of the dna via its interaction with dna-binding proteins. this type of indirect interaction likely will impede finding true motif signals. however, we also took a reciprocal approach in which we searched all of the hmt1-binding sites for known transcription factor sequence motifs using previously generated data  <cit> . using the  <dig> bp window for hmt1-binding sites in our search and a negative control of  <dig>  randomized yeast genome sequences of the same size, we carried out an analysis for the enrichment of known tf binding sites within our hmt1-binding sites. our analyses did reveal a number of over-represented tf-binding sites within the hmt1-binding sites that passed statistical significance cutoff . a few of the most enriched tf-binding sites were for transcription factors cat <dig>  tbp <dig>  dal <dig>  ume <dig>  and mig <dig>  except for tbp <dig>  which is the general, tata-binding protein that interacts with other factors to form the preinitiation complex at promoters  <cit> , the other four transcription factors are all involved in specific metabolic pathways  <cit>  or life cycle stages   <cit> . thus, it is possible that hmt <dig> functions together with these transcription factors to help regulate the expression of genes involved in these pathways.

hmt1-binding is enriched at regions proximal to trna genes
from our chip-chip data, we found that hmt1-binding is enriched across the 5’-regions that are proximal or within the gene body of the nuclear-encoded trna genes . unlike the data from our hmt1-bound orf analyses for genes with medium- and low-transcriptional rates , we do not find any special enrichment for hmt <dig> near the 3’-end of the gene body . given the preferred hmt <dig> occupancy at an average tdna gene, it implicates a potential role for this enzyme in modulating trna biogenesis, potentially either at the level of transcription or via processing, as transcribed trnas undergo many processing events such as base modification and splicing during their maturation.

interestingly, we found that the majority of hmt <dig> occupancy at tdnas did not follow an all or none trend when we examined the binding of hmt <dig> to the entire set of alleles for a specific trna gene species. for example, we found hmt <dig> occupancy at five of seven tdnas encoding tk. however, in some instances such as tdnas that encode tg, we did find hmt <dig> occupancy at both of the tdna alleles. as a way to determine whether hmt1-binding may be correlated to the codon usage, we calculated the correlation coefficient for hmt1-binding and specific codon usage. however, such analysis did not reveal any credible candidates , suggesting that hmt1-binding to these tdna genes is likely a general phenomenon.

mutants lacking hmt <dig> or its catalytic activity display increased trna abundance
to determine if the observed enrichment of hmt1-binding around trna genes had any functional significance, we used rna hybridization assays to compare the levels of steady-state trna abundances between wild-type and hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants. we checked the matured form of trna tg, which is encoded by two tdna alleles, both of which were bound by hmt <dig> based on our analysis. in both hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants, there is an approximately two-fold increase in the levels of mature tg trna when compared to that of the wild-type  panel). we next checked another trna gene, tk, that had five out of seven tdna alleles bound by hmt <dig>  in this case, an increase in trna abundance is still observed, but the magnitude of the increase is not as significant as that of tg .

during trna biogenesis, various processing steps must take place in order to generate final, mature trnas. hmt <dig> has been previously implicated in mrnp dynamics and many of its substrates are mrna processing factors. thus, it is possible that the change in the trna abundance observed in the hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants may be due to a role for hmt <dig> in the trna processing steps. to test this possibility, we used a previously published probe that would hybridize equally to both the pre-processed form and the mature form of tl, which had one out of three tdna alleles bound by hmt <dig>  in this case, we observe an increase in the pre-trna in the hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants, similar to that of the mature trna changes . moreover, the ratio of pre-trna to total and the ratio of mature trna to total were not changed in these mutants. this comparison suggests that the increased trna abundance observed for the hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants is likely due to a change in the overall transcriptional output of trna transcripts observed in these mutants.

hmt <dig> physically associates with tfiiib component bdp1
knowing that hmt <dig> is bound at trna genes and that hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants display an increased trna abundance, there exists a potential regulatory role for hmt <dig> in repressing rnapiii transcription at trna genes. given that the average enrichment of hmt <dig> is mostly at the 5’-end and throughout the gene body, it is possible that hmt <dig> may exert its control on trna biogenesis through some action on the components of the rnapiii machinery. interestingly, a recent proteomic profiling study for hmt <dig> in our laboratory had identified the tfiiib component bdp <dig> as a potential physical interactor of hmt <dig> . bdp <dig> is one of the three components of tfiiib  <cit>  and has been implicated to function as a scaffold for tfiiib-dna assembly  <cit> . to verify this physical association between tap-tagged hmt <dig> and bdp <dig>  we performed a co-immunoprecipitation with a reversed bait and target. in this case, we purified tap-tagged bdp <dig> and the purified eluates were assayed for the presence of myc-tagged hmt <dig> by immunoblotting. our immunoblotting data  show that purification of tap-tagged bdp <dig> results in co-purification of hmt <dig>  as a negative control, we have carried out a parallel purification using lysates from a yeast strain that lack tap-tagged proteins. thus, we have confirmed the physical association between tfiiib component bdp <dig> and that of hmt <dig> 

it is likely that the hmt <dig> recruitment to trna genes occurs via its physical association with bdp <dig>  while our chip-chip data only show hmt1-binding to approximately 40% of all tdnas, the observation of hmt1’s physical association with bdp <dig> suggests that hmt <dig> is binding to the majority of the tdnas, if not all of them. this is based on the fact that tfiiib occupancy is found across all tdnas from a number of genome-wide location analyses in s. cerevisiae <cit> . therefore, it is likely that our stringent criteria for classifying what is considered an hmt1-bound locus excludes some true hmt1-bound sites at these tdnas. to test this hypothesis, we used chip to determine the association of hmt <dig> at four different tdnas, which were not bound by hmt <dig> based on our chip-chip data. as shown in figure 4b, however, there is an enrichment of hmt <dig> at all four tdnas examined, suggesting that indeed there may be some hmt1-binding sites that are excluded in our final chip-chip data set because of high stringency. this also means that we are highly confident of the hmt1-binding sites determined from our original analysis.

discussion
in this study, we applied genome-wide location analysis to uncover genomic features previously not known to associate with hmt <dig>  the yeast homolog of human prmt <dig>  to this end, we identified binding of hmt <dig> to a number of ncrna genes such as trna and snorna genes. enrichment of hmt <dig> binding at these genomic features directly implicates a regulatory role for this protein in biological processes or pathways involving these genomic features. we validated the biological significance of hmt <dig> binding at the trna genes using rna hybridization analyses in assaying hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants, which display an increase in the steady-state levels of pre- and mature trna when compared to the wild-type cells. this increase is likely attributed to a change in the overall transcriptional output by rnapiii, as opposed to a defect in the maturation process of trnas. the physical association between hmt <dig> and tfiiib component bdp <dig> provides a likely explanation for hmt1’s association at many of the trna genes in our chip-chip data.

hmt <dig> has previously been demonstrated to play a role in the recruitment of mrnp components such as pre-mrna splicing factors  <cit>  and mrna export factors  <cit> . furthermore, it regulates transcriptional elongation and termination via methylation of hnrnp and mrna export factor npl <dig>  <cit> . thus, it was not surprising for us to find the majority of hmt <dig> binding sites fall proximal to or within an orf. go-enrichment analysis indicates hmt <dig> binding to genes involved in translation, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme in modulating the expression of these genes. transcriptional profiling experiments carried out previously on both null and catalytically-inactive mutants of hmt <dig>  however, show no significant changes in the abundance of these transcripts from the wild-type cells  <cit> . based on these observations, one possible explanation is that hmt1’s effects on these genes can only be seen under a specific circumstance, such as a change in the environmental condition or an exposure to certain stress agent. this scenario would support the observed growth phenotype for the hmt1-null mutants as they display no distinguishable changes in their growth rate from wild-type cells when grown in a rich media, such as ypd  <cit> . transcription of hmt <dig> is repressed in response to heat shock when compared to steady-state growth rate conditions  <cit> , further suggesting that hmt <dig> is needed the most only under a certain growth condition. it is interesting to note that hmt <dig> has different occupancy patterns across genes with different transcriptional rates, as this observation demonstrates a potential for different modes of regulation during gene expression by hmt <dig>  there are two functional implications of hmt1’s enrichment across the various transcriptional frequency gene classes – first, the highly transcribed gene class contains many of the ribosomal protein genes that encompass many intron-containing genes and hmt <dig> has been shown to be more enriched at the 5’-end of these genes. since hmt <dig> affects the co-transcriptional recruitment of pre-mrna splicing factors  <cit> , hmt1’s enrichment across this region may reflect its role in regulating this process. second, hmt1’s enrichment across all orfs shows a “spike” at the 3’-end of the genes, with this trend more pronounced in gene classes with medium and low transcriptional frequencies. this enrichment trend may reflect the association of hmt <dig> with known substrates involved in 3’-end processing of a transcript, such as yra <dig>  hrp <dig>  and nab <dig>  thus, these observations suggest that hmt <dig> may methylate its substrate during transcription rather than prior to.

hmt <dig> methylates h4r <dig> in vitro <cit>  and loss-of-function mutants of hmt <dig> display decreased dimethylated h4r <dig> levels across silent chromatin regions  <cit> , despite the observation that bulk dimethylated h4r <dig> is unchanged in hmt <dig> mutants  <cit> . thus, hmt1-catalyzed h4r3me <dig> in s. cerevisiae is associated with gene silencing. h4r <dig> methylation by prmt <dig> in vivo is required for many subsequent histone modifications in mammalian cells  <cit> . it can be inferred then that hmt <dig> may also play a role in modulating the levels of other histone modifications. by determining the enrichment or depletion of core histones and other histone modifications for hmt1-bound orfs, the data reveal that hmt <dig> may coordinate regulation at the promoter with h3-specific acetyltransferases such as saga or nuaa <dig> and the rpd <dig> complex, which is an h3k <dig> methyl reader  <cit> . furthermore, our orf-body analysis suggests that hmt <dig> may coordinate the action of compass , set <dig>  as well as kdacs  <cit> . results from our directed chip experiments, however, suggests that these histone modification marks may regulate the recruitment of hmt <dig> to orf-containing gene bodies instead, at least for pan-h <dig> acetylation and the majority of h4k36me <dig> tested. it is possible that the loss of hmt <dig> alone is not sufficient to alter these histone modification states we have identified. rather, it may be the combination of hmt1-deletion with the loss of another regulator that effects a significant change in histone modification levels as compared to any single loss-of-function mutant.

perhaps the most interesting hypothesis we obtained from analyzing our chip-chip data is a role for hmt <dig> in the biogenesis of trnas. in eukaryotic cells, trnas are classified on the basis of their anticodon, of which there are  <dig> different trna species in the s. cerevisiae <cit> . furthermore, the actual number of different trna species is greater in some cases because there can be species with identical anticodons but sequence differences in the trna body  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, each trna species can be encoded by several genomic copies , of which there are a total of  <dig> nuclear-encoded tdnas within the genome  <cit> . hmt <dig> binding is enriched at many of these tdna alleles and mutants lacking hmt <dig> or its catalytic activity display higher levels of the corresponding trna abundance. this overall change is likely attributed to a defect in the output rather than the processing during trna biogenesis, as both pre- and mature trnas increase in a similar fashion in the hmt <dig> loss-of-function mutants. if the change in the mature trna abundance was attributed to a defect in trna processing in the hmt <dig> mutants, we would expect the ratio  of signals obtained from our rna hybridization analysis to reflect such.

transcription of trnas is accomplished by rnapiii and this process requires two gene-internal promoters, boxa and boxb reviewed in  <cit> . during trna gene transcription, these internal promoters are bound by the hetero-heptameric complex tfiiic. tfiiic recruits the hetero-trimeric tfiiib  to the upstream region of the tdna. tfiiib, in turn, recruits rnapiii to prompt transcriptional initiation. the physical interaction between hmt <dig> and bdp <dig> provides a probable mechanism for how hmt <dig> may be recruited to these tdnas. additionally, this physical interaction gave insights into how hmt <dig> may affect the overall trna abundance through its ability to regulate rnapiii transcription of trna genes. while the precise molecular mechanisms by which hmt <dig> accomplishes this remains to be elucidated, our data provide a valuable clue in that hmt <dig> does so via its catalytic activity, based on our data from the hmt <dig> catalytically inactive mutant. this points to a yet-to-be discovered substrate of hmt <dig> in which its methylation may affect the transcription of trna genes by rnapiii. the biological significance of this transcriptional repression by hmt <dig> could reflect a way for coordinating gene expression between rnapii and rnapiii, given the known role of hmt <dig> in coordinating mrnp biogenesis catalyzed by rnapii. as it is advantageous for cells to efficiently utilize its resources during growth , proper coordination would be important for not wasting any valuable resources in executing gene expression programs. thus, it can be inferred that hmt1’s function in balancing these gene expression programs may not be as critical when cells are growing under optimal conditions with plenty of resources, as supported by the observation that hmt1-null cells do not display any obvious growth defect in rich media. further experiments are required to define the specific molecular mechanisms used by hmt <dig> in this process as well as other roles hmt <dig> may play in the described occupancy relationship for genomic features found within hmt <dig> binding sites. in sum, our genome-wide location analysis data do reveal multiple potentially new roles for hmt <dig> in the control of eukaryotic gene expression in vivo, especially in the realm of ncrna biogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our data on the comprehensive mapping of hmt <dig> binding sites across the yeast genome uncover many genomic features previously not known to associate with hmt <dig>  thereby implicating novel role of this enzyme in modulating biological processes facilitated by these genomic features. one such example we validated in this study is the trna gene, for which hmt <dig> occupancy is enriched. the functional implication of hmt <dig> binding on trna biogenesis is supported by the observation that binding of hmt <dig> at these trna genes correlates with their abundance levels within a cell. at the molecular level, our data suggest that hmt <dig> is recruited by bdp <dig>  a component of rnapiii transcriptional machinery, to the trna genes. together, these results suggest a potential role for hmt <dig> in modulating trna biogenesis via rnapiii transcription. overall, our study demonstrates that knowledge of genome-wide locations for a multi-functional protein such as hmt <dig> has the potential to lay the foundation for studies that reveal the factors responsible for recruiting hmt <dig> to a specific genomic feature. given the level of conservation between hmt <dig> and human prmt <dig>  it is likely that some of our observations have implications for studies in higher eukaryotes.
