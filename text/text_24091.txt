BACKGROUND
the family fabaceae includes many crops useful for food, forage, fiber, wood and ornamental purposes. in this family, a few legumes such as chickpea, soybean, fababean, fenugreek, lentil, pea etc. are consumed as grain legumes. the grain legumes are plants used as food in the form of unripe pods, mature seeds or immature dry seeds, directly or indirectly  <cit> . the grain legumes not only provide variety to human diet but they also supply dietary proteins for vegetarian populations that lack animal and fish protein in their diet. considering the growing problem of malnutrition, use of legume species as high-protein food is very important. moreover, legumes are also capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation enriching the soil condition suitable for a crop following the legume crop  <cit> .

the genus trigonella is one of the largest genera of the tribe trifoliatae in the family fabaceae and sub-family papilionaceae  <cit> . among trigonella species, trigonella foenum-graecum  is a flowering annual, with autogamous white flowers occasionally visited by insects. indigenous to countries on the eastern shores of mediterranean, fenugreek is widely cultivated in india, egypt, ethiopia, morocco and occasionally in england  <cit> . trigonella foenum-graecum is extensively grown in the tropical and subtropical regions of india. different parts of the plant such as leaves and seeds are consumed in india. it is also used for medicinal purpose. according to ancient medicinal system, the ayurveda, it is a herbal drugs that is bitter or pungent in taste. it is effective against anorexia and is a gastric stimulant  <cit> . fenugreek is becoming popular around the world with its extract used to flavor cheese in switzerland, artificial maple syrup and bitter-run in germany, roasted seeds as coffee-substitute in africa, seed powder mixed with flour as fortification to make flat-bread in egypt, as an anti-diabetic herb in israel, whole seed and dried plant used as insect and pest repellent in grain storage, and oil used in perfumery in france  <cit> . research reports in recent years have indicated that fenugreek can be a remedy to diabetes by lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels  <cit> .

t. caerulae, from the same family and commonly known as the blue fenugreek, on the other hand, is a less commonly grown herb. this flowering annual with autogamous blue flower is found in alps and in the mountains of eastern and south eastern europe. terminal leaves are mainly used for cooking while young seedlings are eaten with oil and salt. dried and powdered leaves as well as flowers are used for flavoring and coloring bread, cheese, etc in china and germany. they are also used as a condiment in soups and potato dishes and a decoction of leaves is used as aromatic tea  <cit> .

grain legumes like t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea although important in food and medicine are rarely grown outside their native habitat. across the world only known and well-defined cultivars are grown in specific areas. gene banks also harbor scanty germplasm collection of trigonella species  <cit> . the neglected and the under-use status of these locally important crops indicates a risk of disappearance of important plant material developed over thousands of years of cultivation. one of the important factors restricting their large-scale production and development of better varieties is that very little information is available about their genetic diversity, inter and intraspecific variability and genetic relationship among these species. therefore, attempts to analyze possible untapped genetic diversity become extremely essential for breeding and crop improvement. the present study was undertaken with the objective of analyzing genetic diversity in various accessions of t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea representing various countries where they are grown using molecular marker technology.

RESULTS
assessment of genetic diversity in t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea using issr and rapd markers
a set of  <dig> issr primers was used for initial screening of  <dig> accessions of t. foenum-graecum of which  <dig> gave amplification. however, only  <dig> issr primers detected intraspecific variation in i <dig> accessions of t. foenum-graecum generating clear reproducible patterns and revealing  <dig> bands in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb. among these seventy-two bands were polymorphic amounting to 72% polymorphism . furthermore, during issr analysis  <dig> unique bands were obtained, where  <dig> were contributed by accession tmp =  <dig> from yemen,  <dig> by accession tmp =  <dig> from turkey, and  <dig> by accession tmp =  <dig> from iran. similarly, in t. caerulea, of the  <dig> issr primers used for initial screening,  <dig> gave amplification. of these,  <dig> primers detected intraspecific variation in  <dig> accessions of t. caerulea showing  <dig> % polymorphism . with these  <dig> primers,  <dig> unique bands were produced, where  <dig> and  <dig> bands were contributed by accessions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, from turkey alone.

in case of rapd analysis,  <dig> rapd primers were used for initial screening in t. foenum-graecum of which  <dig> primers generated polymorphic patterns revealing  <dig> % polymorphism . eight unique bands were produced by these primers of which  <dig> were contributed by accession tmp =  <dig> from yemen,  <dig> by accession tmp =  <dig> from egypt,  <dig> by accession tmp =  <dig> from afghanistan and  <dig> each by accession tmp =  <dig> and tmp =  <dig> from turkey. similarly in t. caerulea of the  <dig> primers used for initial screening,  <dig> primers produced polymorphic pattern giving  <dig> % polymorphism . eight unique bands were produced with these primers wherein; the maximum numbers of unique bands  were again produced by the same accessions  <dig> and  <dig> from turkey.

dendrogram analysis for t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea
genetic similarity was calculated from the nei's similarity index value for all the  <dig> accessions of t. foenum-graecum considering issr and rapd approaches individually as well as together. based on issr markers alone, the similarity index values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these values were used to construct a dendrogram using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages . in the issr based dendrogram t. foenum-graecum genotypes formed  <dig> clusters . the first cluster grouped together accessions from afghanistan , canada , pakistan , iran , and turkey . the second cluster contained accessions from india . remaining one accession from india  and one from nepal  formed the third cluster. the fourth cluster contained accessions from egypt  and turkey . accessions from ethiopia , turkey  and yemen  out grouped from the main clusters. three accessions from turkey analyzed in the present study fell into different clusters.

based on rapd markers alone, the similarity index values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in the rapd based dendrogram, t. foenum-graecum genotypes formed  <dig> main clusters . the first cluster had two subgroups, the first subgroup contained accessions from afghanistan , india , turkey  and egypt  while the second subgroup contained accessions from pakistan , turkey , and egypt . the accession from canada associated with these clusters. the second cluster contained accession from iran  and nepal  and the accession from india associated with this cluster. accessions from ethiopia , turkey  and yemen  out grouped from these two clusters. in the rapd based dendrogram also accessions from turkey fell into different clusters.

based on both the marker systems together the similarity index values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . here the t. foenum-graecum accessions from egypt  were grouped together. accessions from pakistan  and afghanistan  were grouped together in one cluster. accessions from india , nepal  and iran  were grouped together. however, all the three accessions from turkey fell in different clusters and did not group among themselves. bootstrapping was done using the winboot program to estimate the relative support at clades. the robustness of the cluster was not very strong in t. foenum-graecum .

in t. caerulea, genetic similarity was calculated from the nei's similarity index value considering issr and rapd approaches individually as well as together. based on issr marker system, the similarity index values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  while that on the basis of rapd markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . similarity indices values based on both the marker systems together ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  indicating more diversity in case of t. caerulea. the dendrograms based on issr and rapd markers showed similar clustering pattern when used individually  as well as together . here the dendrogram showed two main clusters. the first cluster grouped together accessions form turkey  and australia . the second cluster contained  <dig> accessions of unknown geographic origin and  <dig> accession each from u.s.a  and spain . the remaining  <dig> accessions i.e. accessions pi =  <dig> and pi =  <dig> from turkey, out grouped from these two main clusters. thus the accessions from turkey did not cluster together as observed in t. foenum-graecum. the bootstrap values obtained using the winboot program in t. caerulea were very high .

heterozygosity and marker index
heterozygosity was calculated using issr and rapd marker systems individually as well as together as detailed in table  <dig> for t. foenum-graecum and in table  <dig> for t. caerulea. in t. foenum-graecum the hav values calculated for issr, rapd and issr+rapd were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in case of t. caerulea the hav values for the same were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for both, t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea, the hav values for issr and rapd systems did not differ significantly. the marker index  values calculated for issr and rapd for t. foenum-graecum were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively while in t. caerulea they were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. thus mi values in both the species did not differ significantly for issr and rapd systems.

correlation between measures of similarity
in t. foenum-graecum, when the similarity matrices generated using issr and rapd markers were compared, a value of r =  <dig> , at p =  <dig>  indicated a good correlation between data generated by both the systems . similarly when the similarity matrices generated using issr and rapd systems were compared in case of t. caerulea, a value of r =  <dig>  indicated a very good correlation between the two marker systems .

discussion
the two marker systems, issr and rapd used in the present study have also been used as effective tools to evaluate genetic diversity and to throw light on the phylogenetic relationships in brassica napi , allium sect. sacculiferum  and asimina triloba . genetic diversity analysis using issr and rapd markers in legumes like cicer  and cajanus  has been carried out in our own laboratory. these studies have given important clues in understanding species relationship, which may further assist in developing and planning breeding strategies. however, no such reports on genetic diversity using molecular markers were available in the genus trigonella. in the present study, an attempt has been made to examine the level of genetic variation within t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea accessions obtained from germplasm collection centers at saskatoon  and pullman . the t. foenum-graecum accessions were selected in order to represent most of the countries where it is grown. in case of t. caerulea all the nine accessions available at saskatoon and pullman were used in present study.

analysis of polymorphism detected in t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea
polymorphism in a given population is often due to existence of genetic variants represented by the number of alleles at a locus and their frequency of distribution in a population. heterozygosity corresponds to a probability that two alleles taken at random from a population can be distinguished using the marker in question. thus a convenient quantitative estimate of marker utility and the polymorphism detected can be given in terms of the mean heterozygosity and the marker index  <cit> . in t. foenum-graecum as well as in t. caerulea the hav and the marker index  values for issr and rapd markers , respectively, did not differ significantly indicating that similar levels of polymorphism were detected by both the marker systems in the given germplasm pools. this was also confirmed by the high correlation co-efficent for issr and rapd marker systems obtained for t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea . genetic diversity as measured by the heterozygosity was higher in t. caerulea  as compared to t. foenum-graecum . based on allozyme diversity, the estimated mean heterozygosity values have been reported for self-pollinating species, vigna unguiculata, hav =  <dig>   <cit>  and vicia tetrasperma, hav =  <dig>   <cit> . the heterozygosity value for vigna unguiculata was lower while that for vicia tetrasperma was higher as compared to t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea. based on issr markers, the estimates of genetic diversity, hav =  <dig>  reported in cultivated pawpaw , was higher as compared to t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea  <cit> .

estimation of genetic relatedness in t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea
data collected with issr and rapd marker systems were used to compare genetic similarity between various accessions of t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea. the accessions could be a mixture of different genotypes. therefore, to have a complete representation of a specific accession, dnas from fifteen plants were mixed in equal proportion. thus within accession diversity was eliminated and a complete banding profile of the accession was used for the analysis.

in t. foenum-graecum, issr and rapd could detect almost similar level of polymorphism . in the upgma analysis, t. foenum-graecum accessions from one country and the nearby region grouped together in some cases while they were placed in different clusters in certain cases. accessions from pakistan and afghanistan grouped together in one cluster while accessions from india and nepal grouped in another cluster. moreover, the three accessions from turkey fell in different clusters inspite of being geographically very close to each other. thus, there was no clear clustering pattern of geographically closer accessions in the present study indicating that the association between genetic similarity and geographical distance was less significant. however, it is necessary to use more number of accessions from each geographical location to confirm the available pattern.

in t. caerulea also, issr  and rapds  detected almost equal level of polymorphism. t. caerulea showed more polymorphism as compared to t. foenum-graecum. in case of t. caerulea also, the upgma analysis showed that plants from different geographical regions were distributed in different groups. here again, the accessions from turkey were not grouped together. two accessions from turkey out grouped from the main cluster while one was grouped in the first cluster with australia. in t. caerulea we could obtain three accessions from turkey and only one accession from other countries. therefore, it would be premature to comment precisely about the correlation of geographic distance and genetic diversity in this case. to confirm the available pattern it is necessary to use more number of accessions from each geographical location.

center of origin and /or center of diversity for trigonella
the place of origin of a species as explained by vavilov is an area that contains a large amount of genetic variability of that species. according to him variation is a function of time, hence the region containing the greatest variation in a species would have supported and sustained that species for a longer time than the other regions suggesting that region to be the center of origin and/or diversity. he set up eight geographic centers, two of which namely the near eastern and mediterranean centers extent into turkey  <cit> .

it has been postulated by vavilov that the near east region extending from israel through syria, southern turkey into iran and iraq and the mediterranean center including spain, morocco and turkey is the center of origin of trigonella, trifolium and medicago species  <cit> . in the present study both, t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea accessions from turkey exhibited more diversity. these results support vavilov's hypothesis. the indian accessions of t. foenum-graecum i.e. accession number  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  separated by an aerial distance of  <dig> km,  <dig> km, and  <dig> km, respectively from each other, were genetically more similar  and clustered together . however, the accessions of t. foenum-graecum from turkey i.e. accession number  <dig>  and  <dig>  separated by a distance of  <dig> km  were out grouped and were genetically more distant from each other although morphologically they were similar to each other as well to the accessions from other countries.

turkey is one of the significant and unique countries in the world from the point of view of plant genetic resources and plant diversity. the country has more than  <dig>  endemic plants and immense diversity has been reported in many legumes such as vicia, medicago, trifolium, lathyrus, onbrychis, trigonella, pisum, cicer, lens, etc  <cit> . many genera of cultivated plants like cicer, lens, pisum, amygladus, prunus, triticum, etc have their center of origin and/or diversity in this country  <cit> . vavilov designated southeastern turkey and the adjoining syria as the primary center of origin  for chickpea  <cit> . similar to chickpea , in t. foenum-graecum the large seeded cultivars are abounded around the mediterranean region whereas the small seeded cultivars are predominated eastwards. thus, turkey may also be the primary center of origin of t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea. however, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by considering more accessions distributed over a wide geographic range especially from the near east and the central mediterranean region.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, molecular markers allowed us to estimate the overall genetic diversity in t. foenum-graecum and t. caerulea and simultaneously revealed molecular based genetic relationship. in the upgma analysis, no significant correlation was observed between geographic distance and genetic diversity. our data further supported the hypothesis of the near east and the central mediterranean to be the center of origin and/or diversity for trigonella as put forth by vavilov.
