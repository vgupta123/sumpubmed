BACKGROUND
african cichlid fishes  constitute the most species rich vertebrate model system in evolutionary biology and ecology . the spectacular radiations of the east african rift valley lakes malawi and tanganyika, l. victoria and surrounding smaller lakes and rivers, are best known for their exceptional diversity and efficient habitat and resource exploitation.  <cit> . numerous studies on different aspects of speciation and the evolution of adaptive traits are based on east african cichlids, e.g.  <cit> . identification of key factors  <cit>  associated with the enormous evolutionary success of these radiations might improve our general understanding of speciation processes. for this a resolved phylogenetic framework is crucial  <cit> . nevertheless, the closest relatives of the east african cichlid radiations  are still unknown, confusing interpretations of evolutionary trends in this group. this lack of knowledge can especially hinder comparative genomic studies and meta analyses, e.g.  <cit> , which must rely on poorly resolved or poorly supported tree topologies. the monophyletic origin of african cichlids is supported by molecular and morphological analyses, as are five major monophyletic sublineages . a sixth lineage, the monotypic genus heterochromis, is either regarded as a distant outgroup or as the sistertaxon to all remaining african cichlids  <cit> . it is further established that  the ear, including the nile tilapia , the world's second most important aquaculture species  <cit> , are placed within the so called "haplotilapiines"  <cit> , of which internal relationships remain largely unresolved; and that  the root of the ear is placed somewhere within a large subgroup of cichlid fishes, the so called "tilapias" or "tilapiines"  <cit> . tilapiines are a widespread paraphyletic species assemblage including a few speciose and phenetically similar genera, i.e. tilapia, oreochromis, and sarotherodon, as well as several less speciose and in some cases monotypic genera such as alcolapia, tristramella, danakilia, iranocichla, steatocranus, gobiocichla and chilochromis  <cit> . divergence time estimates for splits within the african cichlids are scarce and sometimes contradictory depending on the source of data. for example, fossil calibrated dating has resulted in much younger age estimates than gondwana separation based dating . reliable age estimates are not only required to link phylogenetic divergence with the palaeogeographical background but also to appraise the speed of evolutionary change associated with rapid speciation events. until now age estimates for the origin of the east african radiations have been mainly based on geological information, e.g. on lake ages, assuming that divergence of endemic clades took place after the formation of lacustrine habitats  <cit> . other estimates based on gondwana fragmentation yield rather imprecise ages for terminal nodes  <cit>  varying between  <dig> and  <dig> mya for the root of the ear. the present study is designed to fill the gap between the rapidly increasing knowledge of various aspects shaping african cichlid evolution and the lack of a reliable phylogenetic background and divergence time estimates. in particular we intend to  establish a robust phylogeny for the paraphyletic group of tilapias,  identify the root of east african cichlid radiations, and finally  estimate the root age of the primary east african radiation.

RESULTS
the concatenated dataset included  <dig> taxa each with  <dig> bp dna sequence data derived from four mitochondrial and five nuclear loci . of these,  <dig> bp were excluded from the analyses due to alignment ambiguities in non-coding genes and saturation in the 3rd codon position of the mitochondrial nd <dig> locus, resulting in a final alignment of  <dig> bp. a second dataset  was composed of  <dig> taxa and  <dig> bp of nd <dig> . the 3rd codon position was not excluded in this dataset, as taxon assignment to terminal groups rather than basal resolution was the focus. parameters were estimated separately for each codon position. dataset a had  <dig> variable sites and empirical base frequencies of a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig> . dataset b had  <dig> variable sites and empirical base frequencies of a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig> . the bayes factor test  <cit>  identified the hky model as the best fitting model for all partitions except for nuclear exons , which were assigned to gtr + Γ. as expected, nuclear genes gave a better resolution in the more basal splits whereas mitochondrial genes provided increased resolution in terminal groups. the leaf stability index revealed an unstable placement of tilapia mariae  whereas all other taxa were comparatively highly supported. exclusion of this taxon from further analyses increased the overall leaf stability index significantly . furthermore, exclusion of the ambiguous t. mariae yielded a clear increase of bpp and bs support values in affected clades. this effect was not evident during consecutive exclusion of all other taxa , thus t. mariae was excluded from all further analyses. nevertheless, the topology of the remaining consensus trees in both ml and bi analyses remained unaffected.

phylogenetic relationships
trees obtained from ml and bi analyses were highly congruent and nodes were supported for all major clades. both approaches corroborated the monophyly of the haplotilapiini  whereas sister group relationship of this group within the african cichlids gained low bs and bpp values . within the "haplotilapiini the following topology was highly supported :  etia nguti was sister group to all other haplotilapiines.  the mouthbrooding genera oreochromis, sarotherodon, iranocichla and tristramella formed a monophyletic group, hereafter named "oreochromini", after the most species rich genus within this group oreochromis. the oreochromini were sister to the substrate-brooders  as well as to clade ai, comprising substrate and mouthbrooding representatives of the east african radiations .  a clade comprising clade ai , tilapia sensu stricto , and steatocranus from the congo basin  formed the sister group to remaining haplotilapiines distributed mainly in the east/central/southern part of africa. in recognition of its distribution, this group is called "austrotilapiini", in contrast to the "boreotilapiini" with a predominantly west/central african distribution . within the boreotilapiini, a clade consisting of gobiocichla wonderi, tilapia brevimanus, tilapia busumana and "steatocranus" irvinei  and a clade comprising the tilapia  subgenus  as well as t. joka and t. buttikoferi  appeared monophyletic and emerged as well supported sister groups . within the austrotilapiini sister group relationships were consistent and moderately well supported . all major clades were confirmed as monophyletic in a larger phylogenetic framework based on nd <dig> .

the phylogenetic placement of the east african radiations
clade ai, comprising the ear, appeared as sister group to the remaining austrotilapiini . the mitochondrial dataset supported a sister group relationship between ai and the congolian genus steatocranus , though with low support values , whereas the nuclear dataset in accordance with the concatenated dataset, favored the above mentioned relationship  and  respectively). discordant phylogenetic signal was evident in 6% and 7% of the bootstrap replicates, favoring either a placement as sister to monophyletic boreotilapiini and austrotilapiini  or a sister group relationship to boreotilapiini alone . all remaining hypotheses were supported with less than 1% . the 6% signal was only detectable in the nuclear non-coding intron s7: without this marker the signal was hardly detectable . no conflicting signal was detectable in  <dig> randomly chosen bi topologies.

divergence time estimates
divergence time estimates yielded broadly consistent results . preliminary analyses indicated a younger age for node a  than represented by prior a <dig>  and the age estimates for most recent ancestor of oreochromis  were younger  than the age of the oreochromis lorenzoi† fossil  <cit> . thus, final analyses were performed using priors o <dig>  and a <dig> . the mean standard deviation width of the 95% highest posterior density  was  <dig> – <dig>  mya and the precision of the estimate was highly correlated with node age , pointing to more precise younger ages. the age of the most recent common ancestor of the haplotilapiini was estimated at about  <dig>  mya . mean ages for the three major clades within the haplotilapiini were estimated at about  <dig>  mya for both austrotilapiini and boreotilapiini  and  <dig>  mya for the constrained oreochromini . the age for the east african radiations, including the ancient lineages bathybatini and boulengerochromis was estimated at  <dig>  mya  and the subclade comprising the h-lineage and "lamprologini" was estimated to have emerged at  <dig>  mya . in a second analysis gondwana estimates, following  <cit> , were included for calibration point a . results were highly congruent with the first run using fossil calibrations even though confidence intervals increased. the alternative algorithm based on penalized likelihood revealed highly congruent results with those obtained by the bayesian approach .

single dating points  and confidence intervals  are shown for runs with  and without  the cichlid fossil calibration point. prior a was constrained either with  <dig> to  <dig> mya  or with 53– <dig> mya . § letters correspond to node labels in figure  <dig> 

discussion
with this well-supported phylogeny and consistent divergence time estimates for the ancestors of the most diverse group of african cichlids a stable foundation is laid for further studies on this prime model system in evolutionary biology. our results clearly show that the genus tilapia is paraphyletic, and that previously proposed tilapiine subgenera, summarized in  <cit> , need revision. as this is beyond the scope of the present study, we propose in accordance with good practice in cichlid taxonomy to use the genus name tilapia smith,  <dig> only for tilapia sensu stricto, i. e. the small ingroup of southeastern species containing the type species tilapia sparrmanii, along with t. ruweti, t. baloni, and t. guinasana. pending a thorough revision all other members should be referred to as "tilapia" . the informal designation of identified clades etiini, oreochromini, austrotilapiini and boreotilapiiini will facilitate discussion of haplotilapiine monophlyetic groups in the absence of a full taxonomic revision and renders the previously used term "tilapiini" meaningless in the phylogenetic context. a list of all currently valid tilapiine species level taxa and their placement with respect to the newly named clades is provided  and will be available in a regularly updated version under .

phylogenetic relationships of african cichlids
resolving relationships of african cichlids has always been challenging. while phylogenetic relationships between and within the african great lake radiations  <cit>  and riverine haplochromines  <cit>  are comparatively well understood, little was known about the broader phylogenetic framework for the most speciose group of cichlids  <cit> . most often the so called tilapiines were discussed as precursors of the east african cichlid radiations  <cit> . several morphological studies classified different tilapiine genera into various numbers of subgenera largely based on overall similarity of character states rather than on unambiguous apomorphies  <cit> . however, the diversity of this heterogeneous group was comparatively poorly represented in molecular phylogenetic studies  <cit> , but see  <cit> . a recent work based on the mitochondrial nd <dig> marker  <cit>  accentuated the paraphyletic origin of the genera tilapia and sarotherodon, but did not recover well-supported deeper phylogenetic relationships. we present the first largely resolved phylogeny of african cichlids with emphasis on tilapiine cichlids including  <dig> ingroup and  <dig> outgroup species . phylogenetic analyses revealed congruent and largely well-resolved topologies supporting a monophyletic origin of the haplotilapiini, comprised of all tilapiine cichlids as well as the east african radiations. relationships of haplotilapiines to basal african cichlid tribes were only weakly supported, possibly due to high genetic distances compounding homoplastic signal amongst the most ancient nodes. in accordance to previous results the sister group to all remaining haplotilapiines was the monotypic taxon etia nguti from the cross river in cameroon  <cit> . earliest divergence within the haplotilapiini separates the mouthbrooding, almost pan-african oreochromini from predominantly substrate brooding tilapiines and the ear. the latter formed two monophyletic clades with largely non-overlapping distribution, one with a center in west/central africa , and one in east/central africa . remarkably a comparable distribution pattern is evident in cyprinodont killifish  <cit> , explained by a marine incursion in the late palaeocene at about 92- <dig> mya  <cit>  separating west africa from the east and central part. however, estimates for the haplotilapiine clades are substantially younger, with  <dig>  mya  for the separation of boreo- and austrotilapiini and a subsequent diversification at  <dig>  mya . this even holds true without a fossil prior . the estimated ages are concordant with the east african aridification at 33- <dig> mya  <cit> , which influenced distribution patterns of the african fauna and flora, i.e. rainforest trees  <cit>  and caecilian amphibians  <cit> . however, the influence of the drought on freshwater systems possibly inhabited by the ancestors of the austro- and boreotilapiini is not known at this time, leaving room for speculation about the evolution of this distribution pattern. the position of tilapia mariae remained ambiguous in our analyses, which is reflected by a low leaf stability index. the predominant phylogenetic signal resulted in its placement as sistertaxon to boreotilapiines, but depending on the algorithm used, it was also sometimes resolved as sister to austrotilapiines . a possible explanation for this could be an ancient hybrid origin of t. mariae, causing discordant phylogenetic signals in our dataset. indeed, the distribution of the clade represented by t. mariae and its sistertaxon t. cabrae is intermediate between austrotilapiines and boreotilapiines . a more detailed analysis is necessary to elucidate this pattern.

the origin of the east african radiation
the root of the east african radiations  within the substrate brooding tilapiine cichlids  is corroborated with high support values. these results are consistent with earlier analyses based on limited taxon sampling or fewer loci, e.g.  <cit> , obtaining a closer sister group relationship of tilapia/steatocranus to the ear than the mouthbrooding oreochromini. whereas the steatocranus radiation of the congo basin forms a monophyletic clade, the genus tilapia is clearly paraphyletic  <cit> . tilapia taxa included in the study of terai et al.  <cit>  have affinities with the more distantly related boreotilapiini in our analyses. a closer phylogenetic relationship of the ear to the , comprising the congolese steatocranus and a clade composed of tilapia s.str., t. bilineata and chilochromis, is corroborated . biogeographically this is plausible, because austrotilapiini and the ear largely overlap in their distribution around the east african lakes. in this area, the only representative of the boreotilapiini present is t.  rendalli. the divergence of the ear clade was estimated at  <dig>  mya  including the ancient lineages and at  <dig>  mya  for the more derived lacustrine and riverine radiations. though only slightly overlapping, the latter age estimate would be congruent with an origin of the derived lineages in an emerging lake tanganyika, estimated at 9– <dig> mya  <cit> . alternative age estimates using gondwana fragmentation calibrations or an alternative dating algorithm  point to an older age for this node at  <dig>  mya and  <dig> mya, respectively . these estimates favor the alternative hypothesis of an origin of derived lineages prior to the formation of lake tanganyika, in surrounding rivers or peripheral palaeolakes and subsequent independent colonization  <cit> . possibly, an increased taxon sampling with a multi-locus dataset would render more precise age estimates and remove this remaining uncertainty.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we provide the first reliable phylogenetic placement of one of the most important model organisms in evolutionary biology, the east african cichlids. we show that they are sister group to geographically proximate tilapiine cichlids with a main distribution center in east/central africa and that the whole group emerged in the late oligocene/early miocene. the dataset provided here constitutes not only a stable basis for critical testing of divergence dates for basal ear lineages from their tilapiine precursors  <cit>  but also a critical template for future phylogenomic and comparative studies based on african cichlids.
