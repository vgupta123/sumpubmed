BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factor i  is a  <dig>  kda single-chain polypeptide with  <dig> amino acid residues, which is considered as one important family of growth factors  <cit> . igf-i is synthesized in the liver, produced locally in many tissues including the gastrointestinal tract, and regulated by growth hormone and nutrition  <cit> . it exerts biological effect primarily through specific type i igf receptor, which is distributed throughout the intestines of some mammalian, such as human, rat and pig  <cit> . igf-i can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types, enhance dna synthesis and protein content, inhibit cell apoptosis, and play an important role in the development and growth of animals . in addition, igf-i particularly displays trophic effect on the gastrointestinal tract, which has received considerable attention in the fields of medicine and animal husbandry.

studies have indicated that igf-i not only stimulated intestinal growth but also potentially regulated intestinal regeneration and repair. high concentrations of igf-i in maternal colostrum and milk modulated neonatal gastrointestinal tract development and function  <cit> . igf-i supplementation in newborn promoted nutrient and electrolyte absorption, improved intestinal morphology, and increased disaccharidase activity  <cit> . in addition, orally or systemically administered igf-i accelerated intestinal repair in animal models of intestinal diseases, such as experimental colitis, intestinal mucositis, and experimental radiation enteritis . igf-i has showed the potential to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine production in acute pancreatitis  <cit> .

igf-i has important biological functions, but low abundance in natural sources is a crucial factor to limit its further study and practical application. genetic engineering technique is a good method for low-cost production of functional proteins by large-scale culture of recombinant bacteria. therefore, a safe and highly effective expression system is needed to produce functional proteins for the health of humans and animals. human igf-i has been produced in e. coli, but recombinant protein was expressed in insoluble inclusion bodies, and needed to be refolded into an active conformation by denaturation and renaturation treatment  <cit> . probiotics has been reported to improve host health and modulate the gastrointestinal functions in human and animals  <cit> . lactococcus lactis  is a food-grade microorganism widely used in the food fermentation industry and generally regarded as a safe probiotic  <cit> . nonpathogenic and noninvasive l. lactis is an ideal candidate to produce and deliver therapeutic proteins to mucosal system of intestine with simple operation  <cit> . furthermore, the bacterium can survive passage through human intestines and does not colonize the intestinal tract  <cit> . foreign proteins expressed in l. lactis do not require to be purified, may be taken together with recombinant l. lactis, and can perform specific biological activity in body  <cit> .

in the present study, three same genes of mature porcine igf-i  were designed by tandem repeat strategy, and a nisin-controlled gene expression system  was used to express pigf-i <dig> in l. lactis. the activity of recombinant pigf-i <dig>  was examined by using a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium –induced colitis, and the potential of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> to reduce inflammatory disease was evaluated.

RESULTS
expression of pigf-i <dig> in l. lactis
the gene pigf-i <dig> was optimized based on codon bias of l. lactis, and the restriction sites and a stop codon were added to the 3′ or 5′ end of the optimized pigf-i <dig> gene. the resulting fragment was cloned into pnz <dig> to generate pnz8148-pigf-i <dig>  which had been successfully transformed into l. lactis nz <dig> by sequence identification. whole cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig>  were analyzed by using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  to determine whether pigf-i <dig> could be expressed in l. lactis . the protein electrophoresis of the gel revealed an additional band of approximately  <dig> kda, which just corresponded to the target protein of pigf-i <dig>  however, l. lactis nz <dig>  as control strain did not have this band. the rpigf-i <dig> was further assayed by western blot, and the result revealed that the corresponding immunoreactive band was present on the membrane from l. lactis nz <dig>  . these results indicated that l. lactis was able to express pigf-i <dig> fig.  <dig> detection of rpigf-i <dig> by sds–page  and western blot  analysis of cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig>  induced with nisin. a lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig> ; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig> ; lane  <dig>  molecular weight marker. b lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig> ; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  cell lysates of l. lactis nz <dig> 



colon length analysis
the reduction of colon length was an indirect marker of colonic inflammation and often observed in ulcerative colitis patients or animal models  <cit> . treatment with  <dig> % dss significantly shortened colon length  compared with the control group . however, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> or l. lactis improved the shortening of colon length . dietary colostrum-borne igf-i during one week has been reported to promote the growth of neonatal intestinal tissue and up-regulated type i igf receptors in newborn calves  <cit> . in addition, igf-i treatment partially reversed significant reduction of colon length in dss-treated rats, and reduced the thickness of submucosal and muscularis externa layers  <cit> . in the present study, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> significantly increased colon length by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the dss group , but no significant difference was found between the recombinant l. lactis and l. lactis groups. these suggested that recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> attenuated the shortening of colon length due to the use of l. lactis as a host bacterium, and took a certain protective effect on intestinal injury.fig.  <dig> effect of oral administration of l. lactis nz <dig>  on colon length in mice  treated with dss-induced colitis. the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by one-way anova with duncan’s multiple comparison. group  <dig>  received normal drinking water. group  <dig>  received dss solution in drinking water. group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . same letters between the groups indicate no statistically significant difference , and different letters indicate statistically significant difference 



colonic damage score and histological analysis
colonic damage was observed on the 11th day of the experiment by histological detection . dss treatment revealed a typical ulcer that involved most of intestine mucosa, seriously affected colonic architecture, and led to a significant increase in colonic damage score  compared with the control group . as vector control, l. lactis strain treatment showed visible large ulcer surface, peripheral epithelial cells crawling to the ulcer surface, damage being repaired in the colonic tissue and a significant reduction cds compared with the dss group . in the recombinant l. lactis group, the morphological structure of colonic tissue became relatively complete, and colon displayed visible small ulcer surface. in addition, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> further improved colonic damage, and significantly reduced cds compared with the dss and l. lactis groups . these results suggested a direct action of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> on the colonic epithelium.fig.  <dig> effect of oral administration of l. lactis nz <dig>  on histopathological changes and colonic damage score in mice  treated with dss-induced colitis. the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by one-way anova with duncan’s multiple comparison. group  <dig>  received normal drinking water. group  <dig>  received dss solution in drinking water. group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . same letters between the groups indicate no statistically significant difference , and different letters indicate statistically significant difference 



it has been reported that exogenously applied igf-i increased the numbers of goblet cells of the colonic epithelium, and significantly increased histological healing scores in an experimental model of colitis  <cit> . administration of igf-i to cirrhotic rats improved intestinal histopathological changes and significantly reduced endotoxaemia  <cit> . furthermore, igf-i treatment restored gut weight to control levels and increased the number of crypt mitoses in rats with colon anastomoses  <cit> . in the present study, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> reduced intestinal damage, and maintained the relative integrity of intestinal tract in dss-treated mice.

although oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> significantly increased colon length and reduced cds compared with the dss group, the colon length and cds was only partially improved. this may perhaps be associated with the choice of animal models. in the present study, an acute dss model of colitis is induced by continuous administration of  <dig> % dss for  <dig> consecutive days. however, susceptibility of mice to dss was affected by the concentration and molecular weight of dss, genetic and microbiological factors of animals  <cit> . these were likely to influence the results of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> treatment. genetic variations were well known to be important in intestinal dysfunction, such as ibd. il-10-deficient  mice, a gene-targeted mutation, spontaneously develop a chronic enterocolitis due to a dysregulated immune response to ordinary enteric antigens  <cit> . this model might be more suitable to evaluate biological activity of the rpigf-i <dig> 

colonic myeloperoxidase activity analysis
myeloperoxidase  is an enzyme produced in leukocytes, and its activity is linearly related to neutrophil infiltration of the colon as an index of inflammatory response under pathological conditions  <cit> . in the present study, dss treatment significantly increased mpo activity by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the control group , and the l. lactis group revealed a reduction trend on mpo activity . oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> significantly reduced mpo activity by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the dss group , and showed no significant difference compared with the control group. a similar result was shown that igf-i inhibited the increases of gastric mpo activity and immunofluorescence intensity of mpo in the gastric mucosa, and reduced stress-induced mucosal injury in mice  <cit> . the results of this study suggested that recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> has an anti-inflammatory effect, might reduce intestinal mucosa injury partly because of inhibiting the accumulation of neutrophils in the colonic mucosa. in addition, l. lactis as a host bacterium contributed to beneficial effect on recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> in the prevention of intestinal inflammation.fig.  <dig> effect of l. lactis nz <dig>  on colonic mpo activity in mice  treated with dss-induced colitis. the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by one-way anova with duncan’s multiple comparison. group  <dig>  received normal drinking water. group  <dig>  received dss solution in drinking water. group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . same letters between the groups indicate no statistically significant difference , and different letters indicate statistically significant difference 



diamine oxidase activity and occludin level analysis
diamine oxidase  is a cytoplasmic enzyme existing in the villus cytoplasm of intestinal stratum supravasculare. it is released and enters into the bloodstream when the intestinal mucosa is damaged. therefore, serum dao activity is often used as a marker of intestinal mucosal integrity  <cit> . in this study, dss treatment significantly increased serum dao activity by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the control group , and oral administration of l. lactis did not inhibit the increase of dao activity . however, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> significantly reduced dao activity by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the dss group . no significant difference was found between the recombinant l. lactis and control groups.fig.  <dig> effect of l. lactis nz <dig>  on serum dao activity in mice  treated with dss-induced colitis. the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by one-way anova with duncan’s multiple comparison. group  <dig>  received normal drinking water. group  <dig>  received dss solution in drinking water. group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . same letters between the groups indicate no statistically significant difference , and different letters indicate statistically significant difference 



tight junction  is the most important structure of intestinal barrier. it maintains cell polarity and regulates the permeability of ions, macromolecules, and cells through the paracellular pathway  <cit> . occludin is an integral membrane protein localizing at tj, and performs important functions in tj assembly and maintenance  <cit> . colonic occludin concentration was also measured in colon tissue. dss treatment significantly decreased occludin level by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the control group  . as vector control, l. lactis strain treatment enhanced occludin level compared with the dss group, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> significantly increased occludin level by approximately  <dig>  % compared with the dss group . no significant difference was found between the recombinant l. lactis and control groups.fig.  <dig> effect of l. lactis nz <dig>  on colonic occludin level in mice  treated with dss-induced colitis. the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by one-way anova with duncan’s multiple comparison. group  <dig>  received normal drinking water. group  <dig>  received dss solution in drinking water. group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . group  <dig>  received the same treatment of dss as group  <dig>  meanwhile, these mice orally administered with l. lactis nz <dig> . same letters between the groups indicate no statistically significant difference , and different letters indicate statistically significant difference 



igf-i has been shown to maintain a paracellular barrier function in cells by the expression and distribution of tj proteins and inhibit the increase of plasma dao activity  <cit> . in the present study, oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> prevented the increase of serum dao activity, enhanced colonic occludin level in mice with colitis, and regulated their levels near to normal concentration. the results showed the consistency with histological examinations. these suggested that oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> protected the intestinal barrier and integrity, and decreased colitis-induced elevated epithelial permeability.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> and investigated its effect on intestinal regeneration and repair by using a mouse model of dss-induced colitis. the results indicated that rpigf-i <dig> has good biological activity. oral administration of recombinant l. lactis expressing pigf-i <dig> attenuated dss-induced colitis and protected intestinal function by improving cds, mpo and dao activities, and inhibiting the increase of colonic occludin level. these suggested that igf-i expressed in l. lactis could be a good way to treat intestinal diseases.
