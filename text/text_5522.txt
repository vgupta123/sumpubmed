BACKGROUND

pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, broad-host range, opportunistic pathogen found in diverse ecological niches. it is a frequent cause of many human infectious diseases including keratitis, burn infections, urinary tract infections , sepsis, as well as acute and chronic infections of human airways. to understand the adaptation and pathogenesis of the bacterium, comprehensive investigations of the genomes and transcriptomes of p. aeruginosa strains from various sources are necessary.

typical p. aeruginosa strains have a large genome size of 6–7 mb encoding around  <dig> genes contributing to the versatility of the species  <cit> . the architecture of p. aeruginosa genomes exhibit a mosaic pattern composed of a core genome  and a series of accessory genes inserted sporadically, including prophages, plasmids and islets  <cit> . accessory genes could be acquired by horizontal gene transfer from various sources and they often contribute to the unique physiology, pathogenesis, or transmission capacity of the corresponding strains as has been demonstrated in several p. aeruginosa isolates  <cit> . although over one thousand genomes  of p. aeruginosa have been sequenced, only  <dig>  complete genomes are available, limiting a comprehensive understanding of this important group of opportunistic pathogens.


p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> is commonly used in biomedical research and was initially isolated from a blood specimen in the peter bent brigham hospital in  <dig>   <cit> . atcc  <dig> has been widely used as a model strain to survey antibiotics susceptibilities since  <dig>  <cit> . so far, four draft genomes of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> have been sequenced , but the complete genome of the strain is still lacking, hindering the understanding of its full physiological potentials.

in the present study, we sequenced and assembled the complete genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> using both pacbio’s smrt and illumina platforms. we then compared it with the complete genomes of two frequently used p. aeruginosa laboratory strains, p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  to reveal distinct features of the atcc  <dig> genome. to advance our understanding of the physiology of the strain, specifically its morphogenesis, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis on atcc  <dig> and pao <dig>  these analyses revealed the presence of a large number  of prophages in its genome and several unique physiological features of atcc  <dig>  implying the striking ability of the strain to adapt to a variety of environmental niches and stresses.

RESULTS
general features of the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc27853
a total of  <dig>  gb raw data were produced by the pacbio platform. the error correction step produced  <dig>  reads with an average length of 7564 bp and a maximum length of  <dig>  bp. corrected reads were assembled de novo, the contig was then polished and circularized using the smrt analysis pipeline to produce a single  <dig>  mb contig with 158× coverage. the assembly was also validated by mapping illumina-generated reads. the gc content of the genome was  <dig> %, which is comparable to other genomes within the p. aeruginosa species . a total of  <dig> genes were predicted. twelve rrna genes,  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> tandem repeats were identified .

phylogenetic relationship of the atcc  <dig> with other p. aeruginosa strains based on snps from all complete genomes
since the 16s rrna genes in the different strains of the p. aeruginosa species exhibit high similarity  with low discriminating capability, single nucleotide polymorphisms  were used to construct the phylogenetic relationship between atcc  <dig> and published strains. using harvest  <cit> , we collected  <dig>  snps from the complete genomes included. we generated the phylogenetic tree in mega  <cit>  based on the maximum likelihood  algorithm. it became apparent that p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> is closely related to p. aeruginosa t <dig>  p. aeruginosa f <dig> and p. aeruginosa s <dig>  all of which are clinical isolates .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of the currently available  <dig> complete genomes of pseudomonas aeruginosa constructed based on the snps identified using harvest with  <dig> bootstrap and maximum likelihood  criterion in mega software. p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> is highlighted in blue and italic style. the denotation of the strain is listed in the additional file 1: table s1




cog comparison
we compared clusters of orthologous groups  annotations of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> with those of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and p. aeruginosa lesb <dig>  . a total of  <dig> cogs are exclusively present in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> , a much higher number if compared with the unique cogs in the other three genomes . most of these cogs are phage and plasmid proteins, consistent with the high number of prophages  identified in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> . in addition,  <dig> cogs in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> are absent in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  nineteen of these genes have uncharacterized functions or with only hypothetical functions . several site-specific dna methylase  are also present in the list .fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of shared and exclusive genes among four p. aeruginosa strains: p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  p. aeruginosa lesb <dig>  the number of unique genes, those shared among two, three and all four strains of atcc  <dig>  pao <dig>  pa <dig> and lesb <dig> strains based on the cog gene annotations are shown




genomic islands
a total of  <dig> genomic islands  were identified in the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> by islandviewer  <cit>  using sigi-hmm  <cit>  and islandpath-dimob  <cit>  algorithms. the lengths of these gis range from 4055 bp to  <dig>  bp with four gis associated with prophages . some genes in the remaining gis were assigned to functional groups including metal resistance, virulence, regulatory proteins etc. . knowledge of the exact functions of these genes would require further investigations. compared with pao <dig>  three gis that are unique to p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> contain a number of genes encoding monoxoygenase, dioxygenase and hydrolase, which are likely responsible for catabolism of aromatic compounds. genes in these gis were not annotated as they only displayed high similarity to certain genes present in a handful of draft genomes of p. aeruginosa strains that lack functional annotation.

prophages
prophage prediction using prophinder  <cit>  and phast  <cit>  revealed seven prophages in the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  all these prophages were assigned as accessory genes and are designated as prophage 1– <dig> . prophage  <dig> which is closely related to phi ctx is located between genes encoding anthranilate synthase component i and component ii. it is noteworthy that this prophage is observed in all available genomes of p. aeruginosa and its genomic location  is also highly conserved, based on the phaster database  <cit> . the specific location of prophage <dig> and its effect on the physiology of the p. aeruginosa host, particularly the antranilate biosynthesis, remain to be explored. prophage  <dig> is  <dig>  bp and harbors  <dig> open reading frames . it is located between  <dig> – <dig> , upstream of the first phenazine biosynthesis gene cluster phz <dig>  . this prophage does not interrupt any genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis . most orfs in this prophage encode phage components such as phage head and tail, transposases and integrases . besides these structural genes, one transcription factor which belongs to the dna-binding iclr family could be annotated. a previous study showed that this prophage shares high similarity with prophage b <dig>  a mu-like bacteriophage identified by braid et al.   <cit> . interestingly, prophage prediction in the complete genomes of p. aeruginosa revealed that this prophage exists in a few other p. aeruginosa strains such as ncgm <dig> s <dig>  vrfpa <dig> and carb01_ <dig>  but in different genome locations and with distinctive flanking regions .fig.  <dig> circular genome map of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> showing the genomic islands  predicted by islandviewer and prophages. from the outside: circles  <dig> and  <dig>  genes on the + and - strands, respectively; circles  <dig>  prophages;  <dig>  genomic islands;  <dig>  pao <dig> genes;  <dig>  gc content;  <dig>  gc skew. the scale in mbp is indicated on the innermost of the map


fig.  <dig> comparison of the gene cluster of phenazine biosynthesis  and its flanking regions in three strains of p. aeruginosa: atcc  <dig>  pao <dig> and pa <dig>  genomic location of the prophage  <dig> upstream of phz <dig> gene cluster in atcc  <dig> is highlighted




prophage  <dig> is located at the genomic site of  <dig> ,276– <dig> , <dig> with a size of  <dig>  bp. several genes that encode virulence associated proteins and transcriptional regulators were also identified, such as acg06_ <dig>  which belongs to the luxr family transcription factor that modulate quorum sensing  <cit> . prophage  <dig> is the largest predicted prophages in atcc  <dig> genome and is composed of genes from different prophages such as phages es <dig> and d <dig>  indicating a complicated evolutionary history. in addition to typical phage components, other genes contained in the predicted prophages in the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> include those of virulence factors and other functional genes, e.g. an adenylate kinase in prophage  <dig> 

phenazine biosynthesis
phenazine compounds comprise an important class of secondary metabolites and virulence factors in pseudomonas species. all phenazines contain a dibenzol annulated pyrazine ring represented by several structurally related compounds  <cit> . in most of the annotated p. aeruginosa genomes, two clusters of genes that encode phenazine biosynthetic pathways  are present. the genes in the phenazine biosynthesis in atcc  <dig> and pao1are highly similar . however, the phz <dig> gene cluster in atcc  <dig> is preceded by prophage  <dig> island  . on the other hand, the orthologous gene cluster of phz <dig> in pao <dig> , is precededby a large fragment encompassing opmd, mexi, mexh and mexg genes  which are components of a resistance nodulation division  type efflux system and is proposed to pump the phenazine derivate 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylate  out of the cell  <cit> . these genes were absent in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  to examine whether this genomic difference affects phenazine production pattern, we measured the production of a major phenazine compound in p. aeruginosa, pyocyanin , in the two strains cultured in lb medium at room temperature. we observed a higher level of pyo in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> at all time points examined , suggesting that the different genomic architecture flanking the phz <dig> gene cluster may indeed affect the pyo production in p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> .fig.  <dig> measurements of pyocyanin in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> cultured in lb media




virulence, surface-associated, and motility proteins
we compiled a database of  <dig> virulence genes based on a list of conserved virulence factors of pseudomonas species with a primary focus on p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa <dig> using the virulence factor database   <cit>  and the victors virulence factors  . comparing atcc  <dig> genome against this database revealed that  <dig> of these virulence genes are also present in the genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> . a class of virulence genes that are absent in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> include the wbp genes which encode the b-band lipopolysaccharide o antigen, with the exception of wbpx. b-band o-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide serotype o <dig>  is important in conferring serum resistance in host pathogen interactions. its presence or absence has also been shown to influence biofilm formation of the corresponding strain due to its capability to influence the hydrophilicity of cell surfaces and consequently the interaction of the cell with different surface materials and neighboring environment  <cit> . absence of this system in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> probably indicates a defect in its defense mechanism against the host serum system and an altered biofilm formation capacity from that of the b+ strains such as pao <dig> 

interestingly, snp distribution analysis in the genomes of pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> revealed that a large number of non-synonymous variant sites present in the two strains are concentrated in the regions and genes that encode surface associated proteins, such as those that encode flagellar components, pyoverdine receptor, transporters, and type  <dig> pili . these genomic differences combined suggest potentially different surface characteristics of atcc  <dig> when compared to pao <dig>  we therefore cultured the two strains on lb agar surface supplemented with congo red and examined their capabilities to form colony biofilms  <cit> . a distinctive wrinkled colony morphology was observed in atcc  <dig> but not in pao <dig> , suggesting a different surface pattern of atcc  <dig> compared with pao <dig> and a strong capability of the strain to form biofilms. the stronger color of the atcc  <dig> biofilm compared to the biofilm of pao <dig> on congo red containing plate indicated a high level of exopolysaccharide matrix production in atcc  <dig>  consistent with a stronger capability of the strain to form biofilm.fig.  <dig> colony morphology of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> cultured at 25 °c on lb agar plates supplemented with congo red





transcriptomes of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao1
the distinctive pattern of colony biofilms of atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> shown above prompted us to investigate the functional genome of atcc  <dig> and compare it with that of pao <dig> at that growth stage. we performed rna-seq to obtain the complete transcriptomes of both strains cultured on lb agar surface at 25 °c, condition that is identical to that of colony biofilm formation described above. cell cultures following 48 h incubation were harvested and rna was extracted and sequenced as described in materials and methods. statistical analysis including total reads number and bases sequenced, genome coverage, cds coverage and mapping ratio for each sample from rna-seq analyses are presented in supplementary data . to conduct a genome wide comparative gene expression analysis, orthologous genes between atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> were first identified using reciprocal blastn and the ratio of their respective expression in the two strains was calculated by deseq   <cit> .

one hundred thirty seven genes with higher expression levels  in atcc  <dig> than in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  were identified. these include several classes of genes involved in biofilm formation, such as the type iv pili biogenesis gene cluster  which is involved in the initiation of biofilms. genes encoding twitching motility proteins, pilghijk-chpabcde  were expressed at a higher level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> . pilabcde , piltu  and pilsr-yfit-fimtu-pilvwxy1y2e  were also identified to display a slightly higher expression level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> . expression of a proton motive force gene   that encodes a protein involved in energy metabolism critical for the rotation of flagellum in p. aeruginosa  <cit>  was also higher in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> . additionally, several other genes which are not directly involved in biofilm formation but have been reported to mediate the process were also found to be expressed at a higher level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig>  such as chaperone-usher pathway  a  encoding genes which were found to be required for adhesion to inert surfaces  <cit> , the cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase cco <dig> gene cluster  which has been shown to promote biofilm formation under hypoxia through no induction and its effect on cell elongation  <cit> , as well as pyer  that encodes a non-classical arsr family member of transcriptional regulators modulating biofilm formation in p. aeruginosa  <cit>  . all these genetic and transcriptional data support the distinct colony morphogenesis observed in atcc  <dig> fig.  <dig> the genome wide transcriptomic profile of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and pao <dig>  green dots represent genes with higher relative expression level in pao <dig> and red dots indicate genes with higher relative expression levels in atcc  <dig>  the blue dashed lines represent log2-fold changes in expression. selective genes and operons with distinctive expression patterns in the two strains are indicated




on the other hand, a much larger number  of genes with higher expression levels  in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> than in atcc  <dig> were observed . of particular prominence is a large fragment  of genes encoding trehalose biosynthesis. the homologous genes of this fragment in pa <dig> have been demonstrated to be involved in infection of plants  <cit> . genes encoding several other virulence factors, such as leca  and lasb  were expressed at a higher level in pao <dig> than in atcc  <dig> . it was also noticed that several transcriptional regulators which are quorum sensing genes mediating virulence factor production such as lasi, lasr, and rhli and rhlr were also expressed at a higher level in pao <dig> than in atcc  <dig> .fig.  <dig> differential expression of the genes involved in the type iii and type vi secretion systems and their regulators in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and pao <dig>  gene locus tags in pao <dig> are shown. values following gene locus tags of regulators indicate log <dig> gene expression changes in pao <dig> relative to that in atcc  <dig> . the full list of genes displaying differential expression in the two strains and their values are provided in supplementary additional file 1: table s3




an interesting observation is the expression patterns of the genes encoding various secretion systems in p. aeruginosa species. the components of type iii secretion systems , such as genes in psc, pcr and exs gene clusters, display remarkably higher expression levels in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> , whereas those of the type i secretion system, namely t1ss, display a relatively higher expression level in pao <dig> than in atcc  <dig>  in the case of the type vi secretion system  which includes three hemolysin co-regulated protein  secretion islands hsi-i, ii, iii, while hsi-i was found to display a higher relative expression level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig>  that of hsi-ii and iii is opposite, i.e., they are expressed at higher level in pao <dig> than in atcc  <dig> .

discussion
morphogenesis in pao <dig> and atcc 27853
surface characteristics play an important role in the morphogenesis of bacteria. p. aeruginosa is a well established model strain to study biofilms  <cit> . outer membrane lps and extracellular appendages, such as flagella, type iv pili and cup fimbriae, are involved in the initial attachment of bacteria to a surface  <cit> . the present comparative genomic and transcriptomic study on p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> and pao <dig> revealed distinct genetic and expression pattern of surface associated proteins in atcc  <dig>  lacking of the b-band o-antigen  has been reported to lead to an increased hydrophobicity of the cell surface and an enhanced adherence to polystyrene materials  <cit> . increased expression of type iv pili biosynthesis genes and flagella motility genes also enhances bacterial adherence to various surfaces during the initiation of a biofilm. our transcriptome analysis supports the expression patterns of these genes in atcc  <dig> which is consistent with the observed enhanced colony biofilm formation of the strain.

three types of exopolysaccharides, alginate, psl and pel, play an important role in the biofilm maturation and development stage. alginate has been proposed not to be a critical component of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix in nonmucoid p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . the low expression levels of alginate biosynthesis genes in pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> are consistent with the nonmucoid colony morphologies of the two strains. previous studies demonstrated that pel and psl have distinct physical properties and functional roles during biofilm maturation and development  <cit> . the pel locus , containing the genes pela-g, is responsible for synthesis of the glucose-rich component of the matrix, whereas the psl locus , containing the genes psla-o, is responsible for the mannose- and galactose-rich component which forms a fiber-like matrix to enmesh bacterial communities  <cit> . pel is required for close association of the two species in mixed-species microcolonies. in contrast, psl is important for p. aeruginosa to form single-species biofilms. in the present study, expression of pel biosynthesis genes were detected at a low level in both strains, however, a higher expression level of psl genes in atcc  <dig> compared to pao <dig> was observed indicating a role of psl in the development of atcc  <dig> colony biofilm. this result is also in agreement with a lower expression level of amrz  in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig>  as the amrz transcriptional repressor controls switching between an alginate-producing mucoid state and a pel-producing biofilm state through repression of psl genes  <cit> . another important signaling molecule which level in the cell correlates with the capability of the bacterium to form biofilms is the second messenger c-di-gmp. however, expression of several genes encoding diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterases which are involved in c-di-gmp production  <cit>  was shown to be similar in pao <dig> and atcc  <dig> in our comparative transcriptome analysis, suggesting that c-di-gmp did not play an important role in the distinctive colony biofilm formation observed in atcc  <dig> in comparison with that of pao <dig> 

contribution of the phenazine compounds to the biofilm development of p. aeruginosa has also been reported . recently, it was found that pyo can promote biofilm development of the bacterium by binding to extracellular dna and enhancing the formation of extracellular matrix of biofilms  <cit> . higher level of pyo production in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> was observed in the present study. thus, pyo may also contribute to the enhanced biofilm formation in atcc  <dig>  the last step of pyo biosynthesis is the conversion of the zwitterionic intermediate 5-me-pca to the less charged pyo via hydroxylative decarboxylation. interestingly, 5-me-pca, which is exported out of cells by the mexghi-ompd rnd type efflux pump, was also shown to mediate the biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa in pa  <dig>  <cit> . it was proposed that export of 5-me-pca serves as a detoxification means in p. aeruginosa, likewise the conversion of this molecule to pyo which decreases the charge of the molecule and allows the transport of the product  across the membrane without the assistance of an efflux pump  <cit> . indeed, pyo was shown not to be the substrate of the mexghi-ompd pump. the mexghi-ompd system is present in both pao <dig> and pa <dig>  but is lacking in atcc  <dig>  yet, a higher level of pyo is observed in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig>  this suggests that atcc  <dig> may contain other detoxification means allowing production of pyo in high level but minimizing the potential cytotoxicity of the intermediate 5-me-pca. indeed, our genomic analysis revealed considerable differences of the two strains in terms of the numbers  of cogs. there are  <dig> unique cogs present in atcc  <dig> but are absent in pa <dig> and  <dig> cogs present in pa <dig> are lacking in atcc  <dig> . these interesting observations warrant a comparative, molecular analysis of the pyo biosynthesis in atcc  <dig>  pao <dig>  and pa <dig> 

phylogenetic relations and accessory genes of p. aeruginosa atcc 27853
in the phylogenetic tree constructed , atcc  <dig> was shown to be extraordinarily closely related to three strains, p. aeruginosa t <dig>  p. aeruginosa f <dig> and p. aeruginosa s <dig>  this phenomenon is interesting. sequences of the three strains, t <dig>  f <dig> and s <dig>  became available only very recently in the ncbi genbank, and we included them in our phylogenetic analysis. however, this observation does not necessarily mean that these four strains are almost identical. this is because the snps utilized to construct the phylogenetic tree were extracted from the core genomic regions of all  <dig> strains which complete genome sequences are available. the snps do not cover the accessory genomes which are unique to each of the strains. thus, the resulting relatedness of the strains in the phylogenetic tree does not reflect their associations at the complete genome level. nevertheless, in the dataset we extracted, only  <dig> snps among these four strains were identified. furthermore, the three strains and atcc  <dig> are assigned to the same multi-locus sequence type  and the same phylogenetic group based on ncbi genbank, indicating very similar genomic contents of these four strains.

core genome and accessory genes are two main components of the genomes of different p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . accessory genes are associated with genomic islands and islets that are attributed to diversification of strains within the species. this is termed as diversifying selection. certain selective pressure might be responsible for the acquiring of these accessory genes and the resulting genome diversity among the different strains within the same species.

with the complete genome of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> on hand, its accessory genes were extensively examined in the current study. within these accessory genes, the most prominent observation was the presence of seven prophages. prophages contained in the genome of bacteria have been shown to play important roles in the physiology of the host bacterial species  <cit> . for example, two tandem defective phage  islands on the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> genome are the determinants of fluoroquinolone susceptibility of the strain  <cit> . another study on p. aeruginosa lesb <dig>  demonstrated that the four prophages present in its genome could enhance competitiveness of the strain in a chronic rat lung infection model  <cit> . the abundance of prophages in the genome of atcc  <dig> implies the complexity and strong fitness potential of the strain. however, expression of these prophages was found to be low or non-detectable in the present study based on the transcriptome data . this probably was due to the rich growth medium used in this study. elucidating the functions of the genes within these prophages especially those encoding several transcriptional factors may help to disclose the potential roles of the prophages in the fitness of atcc  <dig> to the non-laboratory, harsh environments in nature and in animal hosts.

secretion systems
secretion systems are important for the adaptation and pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa through dedicated secretion of specific exoproteins  <cit> . it has been shown that type iii secretion systems  are correlated with acute infections in p. aeruginosa, while type vi secretion systems are often associated with chronic infections and biofilm formation of the species  <cit> . in the present study, genes encoding t3ss were found to be expressed at a remarkably higher level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig> . the genes encoding transcriptional activators of t3ss, e.g. exsa were also expressed at higher level in atcc  <dig> than in pao <dig>  interestingly, a differential expression pattern of the three hcp islands of t6ss was observed in these two strains, while hsi-ii and hsi-iii was expressed at a higher level in pao <dig>  hsi-i expression was higher in atcc  <dig> . the three hcp islands of p. aeruginosa have been assigned to different phylogenetic groups based on phylogenetic analysis, indicating a distinct evolutionary history of the three components  <cit> . this also suggests different roles of these three hsi islands during pathogenesis of p. aeruginosa. in addition, previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of these three hcp islands of t6ss is mediated by different regulators  <cit> . lasr and rhlr positively regulate the expression of hsi-ii and hsi-iii gene clusters and lasr negatively regulates the hsi-i gene cluster in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . this is consistent with the higher expression level of lasr and rhlr in pao <dig> compared with that in atcc  <dig> . these observations indicate the complex expression patterns and functional roles of these secretion systems in the physiology and pathogenicity of different p. aeruginosa strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, several genomic features of p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> were identified based on the complete genome sequence generated using pacific biosciences smrt  technology. comparing with the genomes of the other two frequently used model strains p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and pa <dig>  three unique genomic islands were present in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> which contain genes possibly related to the metabolisms of aromatic compounds. seven prophages are predicted including the prophage  <dig> which is located adjacent to the phz <dig> phenazine biosynthesis gene clusters. survey of virulence related genes revealed the lack of a gene cluster encoding the b-band o-antigen of lps in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> which is important in evading of host immune responses and biofilm formation. transcriptome analysis revealed differential gene expression of several groups of surface associated proteins and those involved in cellular redox metabolism, and the type i, iii and vi secretion systems, confirming the different surface characteristics of atcc  <dig> from that of pao <dig> and suggesting unique physiological and pathogenic potentials of atcc  <dig>  these information provides genetic basis for the comprehensive understanding of the physiology, pathogenicity, and virulence of the strain.
