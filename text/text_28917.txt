BACKGROUND
many conserved non-coding elements  are likely candidates for regulatory regions of gene expression  <cit> . empirical evidence suggests that as little as a single nucleotide substitution in such a regulatory element is sufficient to significantly affect an organism’s morphology  <cit> . moreover, taxon-specific sequence variation in cnes may underpin particular phenotypic adaptations, such as increased forelimb length in bats  <cit>  and craniofacial morphology in therian mammals  <cit> , while in the three-spined stickleback  the loss of a single cne that is thought to be an enhancer of pitx <dig> is associated with pelvic reduction  <cit> . conversely, however, the deletion of over  <dig>  cnes in mutant strains of mice was not seen to cause any detectable deleterious effects in terms of phenotype, gene expression and fitness  <cit> . a recent study quantified the presence or absence of  <dig>  cnes across seven diverse mammals, and found that many elements showed evidence of independent loss in several mammal lineages, although the phenotypic significance of this remains untested  <cit> . recent evidence from highland cattle  and ‘fancy’ rats , have linked mutations in a conserved genomic region proximate to hmx <dig> to abnormal pinna development  <cit> . interestingly, in rats the mutation involves a deletion of > <dig>  base pairs whereas in cows there is a duplication of  <dig> base pairs. although, the region affected by these mutations is many kilo-bases away from hmx <dig>  its altered expression is the likely cause behind the observed pinna phenotypes  <cit> . it therefore appears that the selective constraints acting on cnes vary across different taxa, and that different genomic regions may all contribute differentially to the overall phenotype of an organism.

cnes have been shown to either display high levels of conservation over wide evolutionary periods, or otherwise occur as group-specific elements   <cit> . while some cnes are known to act as cis-regulatory modules and are thus essential for the correct spatial and temporal expression of early developmental regulators  <cit> , the precise functions of many cnes remain unclear . numerous cnes are located in clusters physically linked to genes governing development  <cit> . in cases where one or more cne occur together with a single gene in a large genomic region, then a regulator role may potentially be assumed, however, where multiple genes exist it is not possible to unequivocally functionally assign a cne to its most proximate gene  <cit> . additionally, interactive databases have facilitated the identification of cnes associated with the development of particular regions or by proximity to key developmental genes across evolutionary diverse taxa . the mode of action of some cnes has been demonstrated empirically; for example, in vivo zebrafish, danio rerio, embryo assays can identify tissue-specific enhancer activity .

in this study we examined the molecular evolution of cnes across mammalian lineages, with an emphasis on correlating differences in evolutionary rates in specific cnes with divergent morphological features. in particular we examined the substitution rate of  <dig>  vertebrate-specific and ~ <dig>  mammalian-specific cnes, which are hypothesised to regulate the differential expression of genes at different stages during development and beyond. to test this hypothesis, we focused on the auditory system, and, in particular, echolocating bats and toothed whales, which have undergone structural modifications in their inner ears as well as neural adaptations to cope with the demands of processing the high frequency sounds produced during echolocation  <cit> .

the evolutionary history and genetic control behind the development of the outer, middle and inner ears, which together form the mammalian auditory system, are well documented . the auditory system develops from the three germ layers and neural crest cells, with the mammalian cochlea being evident from ~10 days into embryonic development . several genes implicated in the regulation of vertebrate ear development belong to the pax and sox gene families of tissue-specific transcription factors , which are highly conserved across vertebrates . experimental evidence, mainly from gene knock-out mouse models, has shown that many of these genes are involved in controlling correct cochlear coiling and semicircular canal development . many of these regulatory genes are under strong purifying selection with highly conserved amino acid sequences across divergent species . this suggests that apart from differences in coding sequences, other factors such as differences in expression levels may also explain the morphological diversity seen across vertebrates. given that many cnes are either known  to regulate the expression of genes implicated in auditory system development, studying these elements may help to explain the observed morphological variation among mammalian auditory systems.

we predicted that cnes located in the same genomic region as genes involved in auditory system development would show increased rates of substitution in echolocating bats and toothed whales compared to non-echolocating mammals that have less specialised auditory systems. in particular, we predicted that laryngeal echolocating bat species would show higher substitution rates in putative ‘ear development’ cnes than those of non-echolocating old world fruit bat species , in spite of the fact that echolocating bat taxa are not a true monophyletic group  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of cnes
 vertebrate-specific cnes
in total  <dig>  vertebrate-specific cnes, defined as putative regulatory regions present in both mammals and fish, were downloaded from the conserved non-coding orthologous regions  database  <cit> , the homo cne orthologue sequences were then used to perform cross-species blastn searches  in  <dig> mammalian species, including six bat genomes . we calculated the percentage of missing data for each taxon, and excluded sequences from  <dig> species with >10% missing data, leaving a final alignment of  <dig>  nucleotides from  <dig> species .

 mammalian-specific cnes
our mammalian-specific cnes are taken from kim and pritchard  <cit> , and are characterised as being conserved across human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse and rat, but absent in chicken or fugu. results of blastn searches using  <dig>  of these mammalian-specific cne queries across  <dig> mammalian genomes, gave broadly consistent results. in  <dig> of  <dig> species > <dig>  cnes were recovered , while the number of significant hits was much lower  in the hedgehog and shrew probably due to the low-coverage genomes.

phylogenetic analyses
 vertebrate-specific cnes
a maximum likelihood  tree summarising overall phylogenetic signal and lineage-specific nucleotide substitution rates of the concatenated alignment of  <dig>  vertebrate cnes for  <dig> species  correctly recovered the divisions between marsupials and placental mammals, and between the two superorders  . all nodes, including the bat sub-ordinal division of yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera, received maximum support with two notable exceptions that have also been questioned by recent studies : the node grouping cetartiodactyla and carnivora , and the node uniting the horse with chiroptera . examination of branch lengths revealed considerable differences within the euarchontoglires; in particular between the glires and primates. the mouse mus musculus was consistently characterised by the longest branch lengths, and thus had the greatest substitution rate, while apes and monkeys had relatively shorter branches and thus slower substitution rates. within the superorder laurasiatheria, all six bat species examined had similar branch lengths to the other five representative members.figure  <dig>

 mammalian-specific cnes
using the annotations provided by kim and pritchard  <cit> , the  <dig>  alignments that consisted of ≥ <dig> taxa were concatenated into  <dig>  alignment groupings each based on proximity to the same gene. distances between each cne and the nearest gene varied considerably, from being located in the intron to a distance greater than  <dig> kilo-bases, based on a reference human genome  <cit> . of these concatenated sections,  <dig>  alignments contained sequence information for all  <dig> taxa and were used to construct ml phylogenies. in order to visualise phylogenetic signal across wider chromosomal regions the resultant trees were grouped according to the  <dig> chromosomes of humans, , and were summarized using majority consensus trees . within laurasiatheria, the bat, carnivore and cetartiodactyl clades were each consistently recovered as monophyletic. however, the position of each of these clades with respect to each other and to that of the horse, shrew and hedgehog varied considerably between regions. within bats, the subdivisions of yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera were recovered by all consensus trees, apart from that for chromosome  <dig>  in which a polytomy was recovered. within each subdivision, the correct familial placements were typically found; for example, within yangochiroptera pteronotus parnellii  was always found outside vespertilionidae.

estimating substitution rates
 vertebrate-specific cnes
results of tajima’s relative rate test  <cit>  used to test for lineage-specific substitution rates  revealed significant differences in the bats, cetartiodactyls and the two carnivores following corrections for the multiple corrections made .

vertebrate cnes proximally located to ear development genes
tajima’s relative rates test were applied to  <dig> alignments consisting of cnes located in the same genomic region as genes with putative roles in ear development, and summarised with heat maps. across species and gene regions there is considerable variation in terms of significant differences in substitution rate as well as either an increase or decrease in rates . all six bat species were found to have significantly greater substitution rates in cnes from the shh and tshz <dig> genomic regions, compared to the horse. the bottlenose dolphin also had a significantly increased substitution rate in cnes from the tshz <dig> genomic region; this was not found in any of the other taxa . all four yinpterochiroptera bats had significantly higher substitution rates in cnes from the irx1/2/ <dig> genomic region. all four species of laryngeal echolocating bats  had significantly higher substitution rates compared to the horse for cnes in the foxp <dig> and hmx2/ <dig> genomic region. the latter genomic regions also displayed significantly higher substitution rates in the bottlenose dolphin, but not the cow sequences. therefore, cnes from the hmx2/ <dig> genomic region were found to have significantly higher substitution rates in all echolocating taxa but not in any of the non-echolocating taxa. raw and p-values corrected for the multiple comparisons made across loci by applying both fdr and holm correction are provided .figure  <dig>

lineage-specific nucleotide substitution rate variation  for all  <dig> taxa and  <dig> cne genomic regions , was visualised with a principal component analysis . the first three principal components accounted for a total of  <dig> % of the sample variance . a pca based on all cnes for the  <dig> species  showed separation between placental mammals and marsupials along the first axis, and, within the placental mammals, some additional separation of m. musculus and p. parnellii from the other taxa. loadings along pc <dig> were either positive or ~0; therefore, this axis corresponds to an overall substitution rate across cnes . principal component  <dig> separated the two yangochiroptera from the remaining placental mammal species. the lowest loadings along pc <dig>  and so corresponding to the placement of the yangochiroptera, included cnes from the shh, nr2f <dig> and mab21l <dig> genomic regions; whereas the highest loadings corresponded to the eya <dig> and auts <dig> genomic regions . the final principal component examined, pc <dig>  separated all bats with the african elephant from the other placental mammals. moreover, within bats, pc <dig> separated yangochiroptera from yinpterochiroptera. the low loadings along this axis include cnes from the mab21l <dig>  shh, ebf <dig> and nr2f <dig> genomic regions; and the highest include cnes from the maf and pax <dig> genomic regions .figure  <dig>

branch-specific substitution rates plotted for all tip and ancestral bat and cetartiodactyla branches for the  <dig> cne genomic regions  corroborated the high degree of variation seen in substitution rates across species and genomic regions. within bats, typically the ancestral branches  had lower substitution rates than the tips, although the ancestral old world fruit bat branch had a higher substitution rate than the two old world fruit bat tips. within cetartiodactyla, the echolocating dolphin and cow generally had consistent substitution rates which were typically higher than the ancestral branch.

analysis of vertebrate cne conservation or accelerated evolution
we conducted likelihood ratio tests to identify specific sites that were subject to either statistically evolutionary conservation or acceleration in the focal clades, and found evidence of strong conservation overall. across all  <dig> species considered, at least 40% of sites showed high levels of conservation  and ~5% showed evidence of being under significant accelerated evolution  . furthermore, across the different bat clades examined levels of conservation and acceleration were similar across most genomic regions.

 mammalian-specific cnes
frequency distributions of relative rates across mammalian cnes in the focal taxa in the two groups, bats and cetaceans, show that within each taxonomic group rates are broadly consistent . to summarise, out of  <dig>  genomic regions containing cnes, old world fruit bats had  <dig>  regions with a relative rate of < <dig>  and  <dig>  regions with a relative rate of > <dig> . the same rates were seen in  <dig>  and  <dig>  cne regions, respectively in echolocating yinpterochiroptera  and  <dig> and  <dig>  cne regions, respectively in yangochiroptera . the median rate and standard deviation for old world fruit bats, echolocating yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd respectively. each cetacean dataset consisted of  <dig>  genomic regions; the non-echolocating minke whale dataset contained  <dig>  cne regions with a relative rate > <dig>  and  <dig> cne regions with a relative rate > <dig> . this compares with the dolphin cne dataset which contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  cne regions in the same rate categories. the minke whale median rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd, and the dolphin median relative rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd.

mammalian cnes proximally located to hearing and ear development genes
in total cne alignments from  <dig> and  <dig> genomic regions located proximally to putative hearing/deafness and auditory system development genes were compared across bats and cetaceans respectively . the distribution of relative rates for this subset of cnes broadly matched that of the whole sample . within bats, several cnes from yangochiroptera appeared to have a faster relative rate of evolution compared to old world fruit bats and echolocating yinpterochiroptera . however, the median rate and standard deviation across this sample of cnes from old world fruit bats, echolocating yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd respectively, and thus are similar. for cetaceans, the median rate and standard deviation were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd for the non-echolocating minke whale, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd for the echolocating dolphin.figure  <dig>

study of cnes in the hmx2/ <dig> gene region of echolocating taxa
given the observed variation in the substitution rate of the hmx2/ <dig> gene region across echolocating bats and the bottlenose dolphin, we looked more closely at sequence variation in cnes located in this genomic region in a wider range of bat and cetacean species for which published genomes are available with a variety of echolocation call types. sequences for  <dig> cnes from this genomic region were aligned for a maximum of  <dig> echolocating species and  <dig> non-echolocating species and branch lengths estimated . across these elements a pattern emerged with bat species from the vespertilionidae family  typically displaying the longest branch lengths. within the yinpterochiroptera, in the majority of the elements the non-echolocating old world fruit bats had shorter branch lengths compared to the remaining echolocating species. in many of these elements branch lengths were also higher in the echolocating cetaceans compared to the non-echolocating baleen whale; however, this was not consistent across all elements. the number of significantly accelerated sites, as identified by phylop, across the  <dig> regions in three focal clades of bats, echolocating yinpterochiroptera, old world fruit bats and yangochiroptera, revealed a similar pattern to above . with the echolocating clades typically having a higher number of accelerated sites compared to the old world fruit bats. in the case of yangochiroptera this is particularly evident in elements crcne <dig>  crcne <dig> and crcne <dig> which have  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of sites identified as significantly accelerated, these elements are some of the most proximally located to hmx <dig> and hmx <dig> based on the human annotation . in the clade of toothed whales, again element crcne <dig> has the highest number of significantly accelerated sites, which corresponds to  <dig> % of the total element .

four of the above hmx2/ <dig> cnes were further sequenced in nine bat families: rhinolophidae, hipposideridae, megadermatidae, rhinopomatidae, pteropodidae, phyllostomidae, mormoopidae, vespertilionidae and nycteridae; and three cetacean families: balaenopteridae, ziphiidae and delphinidae. estimated branch lengths for trees based on all four cnes showed broadly similar patterns . for these four cnes, particular members of the bat family vespertilionidae were seen to have the longest branch lengths of all mammals included, and thus were even longer than those of rodents. interestingly, however, these high substitution rates were not seen among all bat species; particularly myotis lucifugus, kerivoula spp. and murina spp. displayed long branches, whereas plecotus auritus did not for the crcne <dig> element . for all four cne datasets, all yinpterochiroptera species showed similarly low substitution rates. genomic alignments of human, mouse, rat and fugu suggested that, of the four cnes amplified, crcne <dig> is the most proximally located to hmx <dig> and hmx <dig>  this was confirmed by examination of the recently completed pteropus alecto genome  <cit> ; this suggests ~4 kb separates the 3′ end of crcne <dig> and the start codon of hmx <dig>  in crcne <dig>  which is most distally located to either hmx <dig> or hmx <dig>  the old world fruit bats cynopterus brachyotis and c. sphinx had considerably longer branch lengths than the remaining yinpterochiroptera species. within this sample, again there was no consistent difference in branch lengths between the non-echolocating humpback whale, megaptera novaeangliae, and the remaining echolocating toothed whales.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies attempting to link genetic variation and phenotypic adaptations in echolocating mammals have tended to focus on selection pressures acting on protein coding genes , thus often placing less emphasis on the molecular evolution of putative regulatory regions or transcription factors. however, given their role in the regulation of gene expression these two genomic components will undoubtedly play a role in determining species-specific adaptations. here we attempted to relate auditory adaptations of echolocating taxa to changes in the molecular evolution of putative regulatory regions located proximally to mammalian genes associated with the auditory system. the development and maintenance of the mammalian auditory system is a highly complex process requiring the controlled expression of a high number of genes along both a temporal and spatial manner . whereas genes responsible for the basic mammalian auditory plan have been well characterised , those responsible for species-specific adaptations are less known. cnes conserved across all vertebrates are likely to be responsible for the early stages of embryonic development; we therefore also screened echolocating taxa for cnes conserved only across mammals.

phylogenetic analysis of cnes
despite their high levels of conservation, ml phylogenies constructed from concatenated cnes recovered the major sub-divisions within mammals, and, in many cases, the correct familial placements. thus lineage-specific substitutions have accumulated in sufficient numbers to provide phylogenetic signal. in all cases bats were recovered as monophyletic, and support was found for the subordinal division of yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera. although the horse  was recovered as the sister taxon of bats by a concatenated analysis of vertebrate specific cnes, this grouping corresponding to pegasoferae  <cit>  received low support. the pegasoferae topology remains controversial and conflicts with the species tree topology typically recovered by phylogenetic analysis of coding sequences . furthermore this grouping was not supported by analyses of mammalian specific cnes.

cnes proximally located to auditory system genes
lineage specific substitution rates calculated for focal genomic regions revealed several trends within bats and between bats and other mammals. we found evidence for significantly greater substitution rates in all six bat species compared to the horse in vertebrate specific cnes from two genomic regions . the shh gene has a known association with inner ear development , but is also associated with the development of limbs and lungs  that are noteworthy for showing modifications in bats. in the case of tshz <dig>  the bottlenose dolphin was seen to share an increased substitution rate, which could relate to this gene’s biological association with middle ear morphogenesis  <cit> . anatomically, mammalian middle ear ossicles are frequently cited as one of the important auditory system components for high-frequency hearing  <cit>  and it is thus noteworthy that cetaceans possess specialised middle ears .

despite these patterns, overall we found limited support for the prediction that vertebrate specific cnes located in the same genomic region as genes involved in auditory system development show increased rates of substitution in echolocating taxa. in particular, a pca summarizing substitution rates did not clearly separate echolocating taxa from other taxa. however, within bats, a distinction between the bat suborders was apparent, mainly driven by rate changes in genomic regions such as shh, nr2f <dig> and mab21li. in addition, along pc <dig> and pc <dig>  pteronotus parnellii was found to be more distantly located compared to the other bat species. this is interesting given that p. parnellii is unique among yangochiroptera bats as having evolved high-duty constant-frequency echolocation  <cit> . levels of conservation and accelerated evolution of genomic regions were approximately equal when clades of echolocating yinpterochiroptera, non-echolocating yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera are considered. overall, therefore, while differences in some ear development cnes substitution rates were seen between old world fruit bats and laryngeal echolocating bats, many differences were also found between echolocating bat species from the same sub-clades, and even some between the two non-echolocating bat species. such variation precludes any firm conclusions but could reflect the involvement of different genes in bats that have evolved divergent modes of echolocation.

among the bats, substitution rates were found to be lowest along both ancestral branches of all extant bats and all yinpterochiroptera. on the other hand among tips, rate comparisons across species revealed several differences; for example, the two yangochiroptera tended to have higher substitution rates compared to yinpterochiroptera. several previous studies have related the molecular evolution of protein-coding ‘hearing’ genes to the acquisition of echolocation in bats and cetaceans . of these, documented cases of sequence convergence between divergent echolocating taxa have been suggested to support multiple origins of echolocation within bats . our own findings that putative ear development cnes shows no increased substitution rates in the common bat ancestral branch yet do show divergent rates within laryngeal echolocating bat branches would also appear to be consistent with the later acquisition of echolocation in extant bat lineages.

numerous genes have been implicated in mammalian hearing, and also through the series of recent studies, mentioned above, several candidate ‘echolocation’ genes have been proposed . recently transcriptomes have been used to quantify expression differences in the cochleae of echolocating and non-echolocating bat species  <cit> . interestingly tmc <dig> was identified as the gene showing the highest significant up-regulation in the echolocating myotis ricketti compared to the non-echolocating old world fruit bat, and this gene was also previously shown to have several parallel amino acids between echolocating taxa  <cit> . several mammalian specific cnes putatively located either within the introns or within 100 kb of this gene were included in our study, and relative rates tests conducted with paml found that both echolocating sub-clades of bats had relative rates > <dig>  compared to the old world fruit bat in which the relative rate was < <dig>  . however, a similar pattern was not seen in the mammalian-specific cnes putatively located close to six <dig> and myo3a, which were also previously shown to be up-regulated in echolocating bats  <cit> , but which showed approximately equal relative rates in all three bat clades, or lower in echolocating clades.

focusing on echolocating taxa specifically, the four laryngeal echolocating bat species and the bottlenose dolphin initially studied had significantly greater substitution rates, compared to the horse, in cnes from the hmx <dig> and hmx <dig> genomic regions. this was confirmed by the addition of additional echolocating taxa. wider family level bat comparisons revealed that four conserved elements located in the hmx2/ <dig> genomic region typically had the greatest substitution rates in the vespertilionidae. substitution rates were particularly high in species with the highest frequency echolocation calls that also have a high repetition rate ; whereas, no increase was seen in p. auritus known as a ‘whispering’ bat due to its low-intensity calls  <cit> . the substitutions evident in the vespertilionidae cnes were typically clustered at one end – raising the possibility that cne may be truncated in these species.

the cnes examined in this region span across ~ <dig> kilo-bases in the human genome, within this region based on ensembl annotation there are three genes – bub <dig>  hmx <dig> and hmx <dig>  the bub <dig> protein is encoded by bub <dig> which is an essential component of the mitotic spindle assembly complex during early development, disruptions to this gene prove lethal  <cit> . the two homeobox genes, hmx <dig> and hmx <dig>  are associated with nervous system development and inner ear morphogenesis, particularly the vestibular portion . expression of hmx <dig> begins eight hours earlier than hmx <dig> in the otic epithelium of developing mammalian ears, otherwise both are co-expressed  <cit> . mutational studies of mice suggest each gene plays distinct roles in terms of morphogenesis and cell specification during development. null hmx <dig> mutants develop abnormal vestibular apparatus; with inner ears entirely lacking semicircular canals, with fused utricles and saccules and a significant loss of vestibular sensory epithelium  <cit> . furthermore, null hmx <dig> mice display abnormal behaviours such as circling and hyperactivity. however, effects of hmx <dig> null mice mutants appear to be strain specific. in some strains the gross morphology of the inner ear is not affected   <cit> . whereas, in a different strain, null hmx <dig> mutation resulted in hyperactivity and circling behaviour as well as failure of semicircular canal development  <cit> . double null mutant  mice have severe anatomical and neurosensory defects and entirely lack vestibular systems  <cit> .

in hmx <dig>  hmx <dig> and hmx2/ <dig> null mice mutants cochlea gross structure appears unaffected, hearing capabilities in hmx <dig> mutants appear normal but have not been directly tested in double mutants  <cit> . however, a recent study proposed that hemizygous loss of the hmx2/ <dig> genome region may have led to congenital sensorineural hearing loss in two un-related humans  <cit> . there have been no reported defects in the central nervous system in single hmx <dig> or hmx <dig> mutants, suggesting a redundant role  <cit> . if the detected differences in substitution rate in the bat cnes from the hmx2/ <dig> genomic region alter the expression of these genes during auditory system development then it is possible the gross morphology of the inner ear may be affected, though this remains untested. this is particularly interesting given the highly variable nature of bat inner ears, which include modifications to their semicircular canals .

on average the yangochiroptera – the suborder containing vespertilionidae – appeared to have higher substitution rates compared to the yinpterochiroptera across many cnes. within yangochiroptera, vespertilionidae have previously been shown to have a significantly faster substitution rate in a sample of mitochondrial genes and the nuclear gene rag <dig> compared to phyllostomidae  <cit> . the previous evidence for differences in substitution rates coupled with their rapid diversification suggests that unique selective constraints may be acting on the genomes of vespertilionidae.

previously documented causes for differences in lineage-specific nucleotide substitution rates are well recognised  and include effective population size  and generation time, as well as the extent to which changes are adaptive  <cit> . thus these parameters may have contributed to the results of the relative rates tests performed in this study. accurate generation times for many bat species are unknown, published values range from 2– <dig>  years  <cit> , thus longer than those of most rodents and more comparable to larger bodied laurasiatherians . the quality of comparative genome data is also an important factor; only two  out of the laurasiatheria species have high coverage , both of which are arguably not optimal due to domestication. unfortunately genomes for species with body sizes and population sizes more similar to those of bats, such as the common shrew or hedgehog, were only available at low-coverage. as reference points, the non-focal taxa studied, such as carnivores and artiodactyls, were also shown to have variable substitution rates in several genomic regions. therefore, it seems that lineage-specific rates of substitution in cnes in vertebrates occur relatively frequently. indeed fishes have also been previously shown to display lineage-specific differences in cne rates of substitution  <cit> .

the cnes that we identify as showing elevated substitution rates in echolocating mammals represent valuable candidates for future study. ultimately, attempts to link patterns of our focal cne substitution rates to genes underpinning ear development will require functional assays to better characterize their roles in gene regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this first attempt to relate levels of selective constraint acting on cnes, located in the same genomic regions as genes associated with the auditory system, of echolocating mammals we found variation in substitution rate in each of the two bat suborders. although, the functional significance of variation in substitution rates and cne sequences found in the bat sequences currently remains unknown, this could suggest that different selective constraints have acted on the developmental pathways of the auditory systems in each of the two bat suborders. the  <dig>  vertebrate and ~ <dig>  mammalian cnes examined here represent a fraction of the total number of cnes contained within a typical mammalian genome  <cit> . therefore, although this study may have detected some of the large scale evolutionary signals contained within the non-coding component of bat genomes many more fine-scale patterns may remain.
