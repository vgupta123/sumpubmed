BACKGROUND
within the crop environment, both rhizospheric  and phyllospheric  bacteria greatly influence plant growth . free-living, biofilm-forming and root-colonizing rhizobacteria have therefore been considered as possible inoculants for increasing plant productivity and improving nutrient-use efficiency  <cit> .

plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  can have complex effects on their host plants. the underlying mechanisms include;  root system architecture  modulation and increased shoot growth, mediated particularly by indole-3-acetic acid, cytokinins, gibberellins, salicylic acid, ethylene and brassinosteroids;  phosphate solubilisation;  free nitrogen fixation;  suppression of harmful microorganisms;  induced systemic resistance; and  induced systemic tolerance of abiotic constraints .

among these interaction mechanisms, the emission of bacterial volatile organic compounds  has been shown to promote plant growth  <cit>  and voc-mediated plant growth modulation is now widely considered to be an important mechanism  <cit> . apart from inorganic molecules such as co <dig>  co, h <dig>  n <dig>  n2o, no, no <dig>  nh <dig>  h2s and hcn, microorganisms are able to emit vocs . these include acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, terpenoids, aromatic, nitrogenous and sulphurous compounds, and ethylene  <cit> . among these compounds, although  <dig> candidate molecules have been identified to date, very few have been unequivocally identified as being responsible for the observed change in plant growth  <cit> , mainly because bacterial volatiles can act as individual compounds or in mixtures  <cit> .

bacterial volatile exposure can lead to an increase in plant biomass  or to plant death after 21 days of the exposure of arabidopsis thaliana  heynh to bacterial volatiles  <cit> . in general, the positive effects of bacterial vocs on plant growth have been less frequently documented than the negative ones  <cit> . on the positive side, eight bacterial volatiles  have been shown to promote plant growth . short-term growth-promotion effects observed on the model plant, a. thaliana, exposed to bacillus subtilis gb <dig> volatiles include:  modulations of cytokinin  <cit> , ethylene  <cit> , auxin, salicylic acid, brassinosteroids, gibberellins  <cit> , abscisic acid and jasmonic acid  <cit>  signalling pathways;  higher photosynthetic capacity, chloroplast number, chlorophyll content, starch accumulation and iron uptake  <cit> ;  increased tolerance of osmotic, salt and drought stress through the accumulation of choline and glycine betaine in plant tissues  <cit> ;  reduced severity of disease symptoms;  reduced sensitivity to reactive oxygen species  <cit> ; and  increased resistance against pathogens  <cit> . similar long-term effects have been described  <cit>  and for other plant species, such as nicotiana benthamiana karel domin  <cit>  and agrostis stolonifera l.  <cit> .

on the other hand, neutral or negative effects of rhizobacterial volatiles have been noted on plants, fungi and pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . hydrogen cyanide, which is produced by a small number of bacterial species including pseudomonas  <cit>  and chromobacterium species, might be responsible for their negative impact on wheat. complementarily, the negative effects of serratia species on a. thaliana have been ascribed to dimethyl disulphide, β-phenyl-ethanol and the inorganic volatile nh <dig>  <cit> .

despite these studies, several questions remain unanswered and need to be addressed. so far, only two studies on the impact of rhizobacterial volatiles on grass growth have been published. the observed effects were negative  <cit>  or non-significant  <cit> . until now, therefore, no clear growth-promotion effect of bacterial volatiles on poaceae has been demonstrated. the root system development of members of the grass family differs in overall architecture and in the anatomy of individual roots  <cit> , which could result in volatile effects that are different from those known with a. thaliana .

with regard to rsa measurements, most in vitro studies use horizontal petri dishes in which roots are grown in the agar plate, thus limiting their exposure to water-soluble volatile compounds. in addition, few studies have sought to characterise microbial volatile-mediated rsa modification using a dedicated experimental set-up  <cit> . the few results that do exist suggest that bacterial vocs are able to modulate root system morphogenic processes and that these rsa modifications could be related to biomass production  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of bacterial volatile compounds on the biomass production and rsa of brachypodium distachyon  beauv. , based on a 10-day in vitro co-cultivation. the genus brachypodium is phylogenetically close to the temperate cereal genera triticum, hordeum and avena in the subfamily pooideae  <cit>  and it is now considered to be a promising model genus for studying root system development in cereals and the impact on plant yield  <cit> . in this study we sought to answer the following questions: what are the main plantlet phenotypes induced by bacterial volatiles? based on the biomass production and rsa results in our screening system, which strains have the most significant effect? how do the observed effects differ from those reported for dicotyledonous plants such as a. thaliana? the results are discussed within the context of the potential and limits of the in vitro system used in the study.

RESULTS
characteristics of the in vitro co-cultivation system
in order to expose b. distachyon bd <dig> plantlets to bacterial volatile compounds and assess their effects on biomass production while measuring rsa parameters, a near-vertical co-cultivation system was set up . the bacterial growth media was based on the work of  <cit>  and its composition was a compromise between a minimal medium and a nutrient one. the plants were grown on an agar plate containing hoagland’s medium, which was physically separated from the bacteria, but shared the same atmosphere. the plantlets could be maintained in this system at 22 °c for up to 10 days. the leaves and roots grew on top of the agar plate and were therefore exposed to bacterial volatiles, whatever their polarity or solubility in the agar. three kinds of roots were potentially produced by the plantlets: a primary root , secondary roots  and adventitious roots . these three types of roots correspond to the ‘primary seminal axile root’, the ‘branch roots’ and the ‘coleoptile nodal roots’ defined by  <cit> . this experimental set-up did not induce any gradient effects because all the plantlets were positioned at the same distance from the source of the volatile compounds.fig.  <dig> 
in vitro co-cultivation system. b. distachyon bd <dig> plantlets were photographed after 10 days of near-vertical growth without  or with  exposure to bsugb <dig> volatiles. the bacterial compartment contains a farag et al.  <cit>  medium and the plant compartment contains a hoagland agar plate. both growing media are physically separated, which limits plant-bacteria interactions to the exchange of volatiles. the scale bar is  <dig>  cm long. the arrows point the adventitious roots , the secondary roots  and the primary root  locations



principal component analysis  and strain clustering
fourteen variables were measured on the b. distachyon plantlets after 10 days of volatile compound-based interactions with each of the  <dig> bacterial strains . in order to group the strains in terms of their growth-modulation ability, a pca was performed on the dataset based on weighted and reduced variables . this processing enabled us to assign the same weight for biomass- or rsa-related variable classes. within each class, each variable had the same weight, irrespective of its order of magnitude. the  <dig> principal components  were then used as input variables to cluster the strains based on the euclidian distance and the ward algorithm.fig.  <dig> pca based on individual weighted and reduced data  and correlation circle between the  <dig> measured variables and the two first components of the pca . presented values are means of  <dig> or  <dig> biological replicates +/− standard error of the mean for each strain and the control, respectively. each of the five clusters defined by the hierarchical clustering processing is presented in a different colour: cluster  <dig>   black;  <dig>  green;  <dig>  yellow;  <dig>  blue; and  <dig>  red. pc  <dig> is correlated mainly with the biomass production of the plantlets exposed to the bacterial volatile compounds, whereas pc <dig> is related to rsa modulation. the proportion of the total variance explained by the two first axes is  <dig>  %



axes  <dig> and  <dig> account for  <dig>  % of the total variance. axis  <dig> is positively correlated with the growth-promotion ability of the strains, namely the total biomass , root biomass , shoot biomass , leaf area  and total root length  values . in contrast, axis  <dig> is related to rsa modulation and is positively correlated with secondary root growth , total secondary root length , mean secondary root length  and secondary root density ) and negatively correlated with adventitious root growth , total adventitious root length  and mean adventitious root length ).

based on the pc values, the clustering algorithm allowed us to define five clusters of strains that induced consistent changes in the plantlet phenotypes . cluster  <dig> contained strains that did not affect plant phenotype significantly compared with the control. only three cluster  <dig> strains slightly increased biomass production, but the overall effect was not significant. the cluster  <dig> strains effects on the root branching process were variable. strains in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> greatly increased biomass production, but had variable effects on rsa. cluster  <dig> contained only one strain, which had the greatest growth-promotion ability .fig.  <dig> relative growth promotion effects  on biomass  and rsa  variables. each presented value is the mean of the relative differences between the replicates of the strains within a given cluster and the control without bacteria +/− standard error of the mean. rsa parameters with the five highest correlation coefficients to pc <dig> and pc <dig> are presented. the p-values are displayed on the graphs. significant changes compared with the control without bacteria are marked with an asterisk 



cluster composition 
cluster  <dig> contained bpac <dig> and pfl89b <dig> in addition to the control . cluster  <dig> had eight strains belonging to seven species and grouped into two sub-groups:  abrsp <dig>  eco99b <dig>  ppoe <dig>  ppub <dig> with positive pc <dig> values; and  avif <dig>  bcea <dig>  ppomxc <dig> and rtetfi <dig> with negative pc <dig> values. among the strains in cluster  <dig>  most of them  had low positive pc <dig> values. bpuc <dig> and bput <dig> defined cluster  <dig>  the only strain belonging to cluster  <dig> was bsugb <dig> 

each cluster was further characterised according to its relative growth-promotion effects on biomass and rsa variables . for each variable, the cluster effect was expressed as the mean of the relative differences between the replicates of the strains within a given cluster and the control without bacteria.

main volatile compound-mediated modulations of biomass production 
with regard to biomass production, the control plantlets had a tb of  <dig>  mg associated with a root-to-shoot ratio  value of  <dig>  . relative to the control, the plantlets exposed to the volatiles emitted by the cluster  <dig> strains showed no significant increase  in any of the measured parameters. the overall increase in tb , due mainly to root growth promotion , induced by cluster  <dig> strains was not significant. the increases in tb observed in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were high , but the plantlets in these clusters differed in terms of biomass allocation. indeed, cluster  <dig> strains induced a higher increase in rb . cluster  <dig> had the highest increase in biomass production , its rs shift  being very similar to the cluster  <dig> value. it is worth noting that the rb production of cluster  <dig> represented  <dig>  % of the control level . finally, la was increased by  <dig>  % in cluster  <dig>  this trait is proportional to sb production for all the defined clusters.fig.  <dig> impact of individual strain volatile compounds on biomass variables. the presented variables are: the tb , rs , sb , rb  and la . the strains are grouped according to the clusters defined earlier, based on pc. within each cluster, the strains are ranked in ascending mean value order. presented values are means of the four experimental replicates  for each strain and the control, respectively). the p-values are displayed on the graphs. significant changes compared with the control without bacteria are marked with an asterisk 



biomass modulation potential of individual strains
apart from identifying the main grass plant phenotypes modulated by bacterial volatiles exposure, this study also sought to screen individual strains for their growth-promotion ability .

tb is very significantly modulated by bacterial volatiles . out of the  <dig> strains,  <dig> induced a significant increase in tb production , ranging from  <dig>  mg  to  <dig>  mg . as stated earlier, no significant effect was noted for pfl89b <dig> and bpac <dig>  and this was also the case for all the considered variables.

only three out of eight cluster  <dig> strains induced a significant increase in tb production: eco99b <dig>  ppub <dig> and ppoe <dig>  all three belong to the same sub-group and are characterised by positive pc <dig> values. all the other biomass-related traits remained unaffected within this cluster, apart from la for only one strain . due to its narrow pc <dig> positioning , cluster  <dig> showed low intra-cluster variability for biomass production, whatever the variable.

in contrast, cluster  <dig> strains were more spread out on the pc <dig> axis and therefore presented greater heterogeneity, with the tb ranging from  <dig>  mg  to  <dig>  mg . all six of these strains showed a significant ability to increase tb and la and only those plantlets exposed to paei <dig> volatiles did not show any significant changes in sb and rb . as observed for cluster  <dig> strains, individual rs values remained statistically unaffected by all six strains .

the cluster  <dig> strains  had similar effects on biomass production and both of them increased tb, sb, rb and la. compared with clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these strains induced higher rb production, leading to a higher mean rs value , but bpuc <dig> was the only strain out of all  <dig> that was able to change rs significantly. cluster 5′s single bacillus subtilis strain  induced the highest tb, sb and rb production  without significantly affecting the rs value compared with the control.

main volatile-mediated modulations of root system architecture 
with regard to rsa, the most correlated variables to pc <dig> and pc <dig> were selected to characterise each strain group . the control plantlets presented a trl of  <dig>  cm, with limited secondary  or adventitious root production . srd was therefore limited to  <dig>  secondary root cm− <dig> of primary root . cluster  <dig> showed no significant increase either in biomass production or rsa parameters. unlike biomass production, cluster  <dig> strains were able to induce a  <dig>  % overall increase in trl. the rsa modulation ability of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> was consistent with their respective rs values. both clusters greatly promoted total biomass production, but the trl increase in cluster  <dig> was limited to  <dig>  %, compared with a  <dig>  % increase in cluster  <dig>  the tarl increase was higher in cluster  <dig>  than in cluster  <dig> . cluster  <dig> had the highest increase in trl , due almost entirely to increases in tarl  and srn  compared with the control without bacteria. the msrl increase  was not significant.fig.  <dig> impact of individual strain volatile compounds on the main rsa variables. the presented variables are the trl , prl , srn , msrl , arn  and marl . the strains are grouped according to the clusters defined earlier, based on pc. within each cluster, the strains are ranked in ascending mean value order. presented values are means of the four experimental replicates  for each strain and the control, respectively). the p-values are displayed on the graphs. significant changes compared with the control without bacteria are marked with an asterisk 



modulation of the root system architecture  by individual strains
overall, the variability in the rsa parameters was higher than that of the biomass variables, apart from trl and primary root length . none of the cluster  <dig> strains induced significant changes in rsa variables.

with regard to cluster  <dig> strains, only bcea <dig> induced significant changes in trl, arn and marl . therefore, it is mostly responsible for the aforementioned overall cluster  <dig> significant change in trl. none of these strains affected prl, srn or msrl significantly . it should be noted that pc2-positive strains showed the highest srn and msrl within this cluster. apart from rtetfi <dig>  the same was true for pc2-negative ones with regard to arn and marl. four out of six strains increased trl in cluster  <dig>  in contrast, bamin937a and sma <dig> did not induce significant change in trl and gave the lowest msrl and marl values. in addition, bamin937a volatiles seemed to slightly reduce prl  compared with the control . this negative effect of bamin937a volatiles on prl was balanced by an average srn  and a high arn . the only cluster  <dig> strain that increased prl was ecljm <dig> . at the cluster  <dig> level, no statistically significant effect was measured for srn and msrl. all cluster  <dig> strains increased arn, apart from paei <dig>  this strain, together with bpuse <dig>  induced the production of significantly longer adventitious roots . both arn and marl showed high intra-cluster variability, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm plantlet− <dig>  respectively.

cluster  <dig> strains increased trl, arn and marl, but had no significant effect on srn and msrl. on average, contrary to secondary root traits, cluster  <dig> strains promoted adventitious root growth more effectively than cluster  <dig> strains did. only bput <dig> significantly enhanced prl . as illustrated in fig. 5b, this rsa parameter was one of the traits least affected by bacterial volatiles.

the cluster  <dig> strain  had a significant impact on most rsa parameters, apart from prl and msrl. it induced the highest trl , explained mainly by high srn and arn values .

correlations between biomass production and root system architecture  traits
in our experiment, tb production was correlated mainly with trl, srn, arn and srd, with r values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and to a lesser extent with tsrl and tarl, with r values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. prl was the rsa parameter least correlated  with tb and it was not correlated with other rsa parameters either positively  or negatively .

discussion
bacterial volatiles have a significant impact on the early developmental stages of a model grass
as shown in fig.  <dig>  representative plantlets subjected to bsugb <dig> volatiles reached the 3-leaf stage  after 10 days of co-cultivation, whereas control plantlets had only two unfolded leaves . this observation is consistent with the results reported by  <cit> , indicating that pgpr can induce significant changes in plant growth rate. this could also explain the observed rsa differences because b. distachyon plantlets are known to produce up to two coleoptile nodal adventitious roots at stage  <dig>  <cit> . in our in vitro system, tb production was strongly correlated with traits related to secondary and adventitious root growth. the correlation between tb production and prl was weaker. similar correlation results between tb and prl, as well as tsrl, were observed for a. thaliana by  <cit> , indicating that a branched root system phenotype seems to be associated with increased sb production.

apart from bpuc <dig>  the biomass allocation  of the plantlets was not significantly influenced by bacterial volatiles. the observed growth-promotion effects therefore did not seem to be due to energy being used to increase root growth instead of shoot development.

contrasting biomass and root system architecture  modulations define the five groups of bacterial strains
the bacterial volatiles used in this study led to five groups of phenotypes being defined.

group  <dig> strains  did not cause any significant change after 10 days in either plant biomass production or rsa.

three  out of eight strains in group  <dig> were able to increase plant total biomass significantly. this reflected altered root branching characterised by a higher srn and msrl.

group  <dig> was characterised by high biomass production, but moderate impact on trl. this group contained bamin937a, bpuse <dig>  ecljm <dig>  paei <dig>  pfl29arp and sma <dig>  which were all able to promote plant growth significantly.

group  <dig> contained two strains belonging to the same species and showing high growth-promotion potential: bpuc <dig> and bput <dig>  they both induced a great increase in rb and trl, which significantly affected biomass allocation for bpuc <dig> 

the single strain in cluster  <dig>  bsugb <dig>  showed the highest biomass production, with rb representing  <dig>  % of the control level. bsugb <dig> induced the highest increase in trl , due almost entirely to increases in tarl  and srn , without significantly affecting the growth of the primary root.

the plant growth modulation abilities of bsugb <dig>  bamin937a, ecljm <dig>  bpac <dig>  pfl89b <dig> and burkholderia cepacia were consistent with those observed by  <cit>  and  <cit>  on a. thaliana. the volatiles emitted by sma <dig>  bput <dig>  eco99b <dig>  pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas putida, however, improved b. distachyon biomass production without having any significant effect on a. thaliana growth  <cit> . the observed differences could be due to the receiving plant species or to technical constraints , resulting in different volatile concentrations and perceptions in the sealed system.

variability exists up to the intra-specific level and is not related to taxonomy
our results accord with the existing literature in that they suggest that the growth-promoting effect of particular strains is specific  <cit> . with the bacterial volatile emission profiles differing at the genus, species and strain levels  <cit> , it is likely that their volatile-mediated growth-promotion ability will vary. strains belonging to the same species can induce fairly consistent plant growth promotion  or have more variable effects on biomass production and rsa .

previous research on pgpr focused mainly on gram-negative strains  <cit> . more recently, bacillus strains have been tested for their growth-promoting ability  <cit> . in the present study, our strain selection included both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . from a physiological point of view, most gram-negative bacteria are unable to form spores  <cit> . this could affect their survival rate under natural adverse conditions or during formulation or storage prior to application  <cit> . under our screening conditions, growth promotion was observed for both gram-positive and gram-negative strains, which is consistent with the results obtained on a. thaliana for bsugb <dig> and ecljm <dig>  <cit> . although cluster  <dig> and  <dig> strains belonged to the gram-positive bacillus genus, no clear trend appeared that would support the hypothesis that gram-positive strains possess higher growth promotion ability. this point was emphasised by:  the cluster  <dig> and  <dig> strain composition;  the presence of a bacillus strain  in the negative control cluster; and  the polyphyletic nature of bacterial groups based on gram staining results  <cit> .table  <dig> characteristics of the bacterial strains used in the study. for each of the  <dig> strains, the acronym, gram type, family, reported ecophysiological characteristics and bibliographical references are presented

contrasting effects indicate some heterogeneity in bacterial volatile production
the induced changes in the plantlet phenotypes varied greatly from one cluster to another. we hypothesize, therefore, that the volatile blends emitted by the bacteria were in line with this observation, both quantitatively  and qualitatively . this hypothesis has to be assessed based on a thorough analysis of the volatile emission kinetics of the strains used in the present study. among the putative bioactive volatiles, the most important and prominent inorganic volatiles released by bacteria are ammonia , carbon dioxide and hcn. moreover,  <dig> -butanediol and its precursor, acetoin, are likely to be produced on the sucrose-containing, low ph murashige & skoog medium  <cit> . microbes simultaneously produce  <dig> -butanediol and co <dig> from pyruvate by a fermentation process that involves the synthesis of the volatile precursor, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone   <cit> . in vitro, the observed volatile-mediated growth-promotion effects could therefore be at least partially linked to co <dig> emissions  <cit> . a significant increase in co <dig> concentration due to bacterial emission, however, was unlikely in our experiment because it was sealed by co2-permeable parafilm ®  <cit> . experiments testing this hypothesis could be performed by either absorbing the co <dig> with ba <dig>  measuring co <dig> in the reaction vessel or performing the experiments without any seal. with regard to the other biologically-active bacterial volatiles , their roles in the growth promotion of b. distachyon remain to be investigated. more specifically, the volatile impacts on targeted processes driving the primary, secondary  and adventitious  root development should be studied. indeed, it is well known that bacterial volatiles are able to modulate the main hormonal pathways  <cit>  and that both specific and shared hormonal pathways are involved in postembryonic root development .

from in vitro conditions to the field
the in vitro co-cultivation system used in this study enabled us to screen  <dig> bacterial strains for their volatile-mediated plant growth-promotion ability over a 10-day co-cultivation period. the b. distachyon plantlets were grown on near-vertical agar plates alongside a bacterial inoculum developed on a murashige & skoog medium that was supplemented with sucrose and tryptic soy agar  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that voc profiles and the growth promotion effects of bacterial volatiles could depend on inoculum size and cultivation medium composition  <cit> . due to technical constraints related to the overnight growth of the  <dig> bacterial suspensions, our inoculum size was limited to 2* <dig> colony-forming units , which is lower than the values used by  <cit>  and  <cit> . the medium  <cit>  used in this study was a murashige & skoog-based medium that allowed all  <dig> strains to grow, while emitting a limited amount of vocs itself . it is worth noting that the inoculum dose did not influence results when nutrient-poor media such as murashige & skoog or angle media were used in other studies  <cit> . in addition, plant growth-promotion effects mediated by bacillus volatiles were observed only when a murashige & skoog medium was used to grow the bacteria as well as the plants  <cit> . so the observed effects of different bacterial volatiles on plant growth need to be qualified as being media dependent. the same holds true for the results of the present study.

transposing obtained results to field conditions is not straightforward and remains challenging  <cit> . this is due partly to the technical constraints  that limit the duration of the plant cultivation process, and thus restricted the scope of the present study to early developmental stages. in the field, in order to optimize resource-use efficiency under agronomical conditions, the main root foraging zones should ideally be located in the resource-rich areas of the soil  <cit> . in the present study, the observed rsa modulations could have contributed to greater tolerance of transient or prolonged drought stress because of increased root branching in the soil upper layers  or, to a lesser extent, a longer primary root , respectively. such root phenotypes could also help plants efficiently acquire either relatively immobile  or mobile  nutrients . moreover, various constraints  may influence the bacterial growth and release of volatiles, hence modulating the outcome of the plant-bacteria interactions mediated by volatile compounds under field conditions.

future prospects
the volatile emission kinetics of the complete set of strains are now being characterised in order to identify volatile compounds/mixtures that promote b. distachyon growth. there are more than  <dig> bacterial vocs in the superscent public database  and about  <dig> microbial vocs from  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> fungal species in the ‘mvoc’ database . once the active compounds have been identified, experiments closer to field conditions should be performed. on the one hand, b. distachyon plantlets could be exposed to the bacterial volatile blends based on an ex vitro set-up similar to the one designed by  <cit>  or  <cit> . this would allow the plants to  perceive the volatile signature in the root system without directly exposing the whole plant to the volatile blend and  reach older developmental stages corresponding to a mature rsa. on the other hand, slow-release formulations of the voc candidates like those used in integrated pest management  <cit>  could be used to expose the root system to controlled voc concentrations and assess their effects in real soil conditions. indeed, the voc diffusion rate from their release point could be influenced by their polarity and the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil matrix  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on bacterial volatile-mediated growth promotion of a grass plant. using an in vitro near-vertical screening set-up, five groups of strains inducing characteristic changes in a b. distachyon phenotype were defined. contrasting modulations of biomass production coupled with changes in rsa were observed. most of the strains that increased total plant biomass also modulated adventitious root growth. under our screening conditions, total biomass production was strongly correlated with the length and branching of the root system components, except for primary root length. irrespective of the considered phenotypic variables, b. subtilis gb03’s volatile compounds induced the most significant changes. considering the great diversity of bacterial volatile production, further experiments are needed to characterise the inorganic and organic volatile emission kinetics of these bacterial strains in order to identify the candidates responsible for the observed growth-promotion effects and to assess their influence on plant growth under agricultural soil conditions.
