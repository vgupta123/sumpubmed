BACKGROUND
blueberry  is an economically important small fruit crop and a member of ericaceae family which includes many species, such as blueberry, cranberry , lingonberry , rhododendron, and more than  <dig> other species  <cit> . three major types of blueberry are harvested commercially including lowbush , highbush , and rabbiteye bluberry . although mostly originated in north america, many blueberry species are widely grown in asia, europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand owing in part to their high level of vitro antioxidant capacities  <cit> . blueberry is becoming a major crop in china, cultivated widely from temperate area to subtropical region. there are currently three major areas for blueberry cultivation in china, the jilin and liaoning provinces, the shandong provinces and the areas of the yangtze river  <cit> .

demand and consumption worldwide of blueberry has greatly increased in recent years for its beneficial influence on human health. these positive effects are generally due to the high levels of flavonoid  <cit> , which have been linked to improve night vision, prevent macular degeneration, and decrease the heart disease  <cit> . therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that trigger biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanin metabolites during fruit and color development. the blueberry genome is large  and genomic information is limited compared to some plants like grape, for example  <cit> , which restrains the dissection of blueberry. over the past decades, more attention has been focused on the analysis of plant cold resistance, cultivation, and effects on human health  <cit> . since massive amounts of information can be obtained from genome-scale expression data, rna sequencing has become a powerful technology to profile the transcriptome  <cit> . to date, rna sequencing has been reported in bilberry  and cranberry  <cit> . recently, transcriptome sequences of blueberry were analyzed during cold acclimation and at different development stages of fruit by ests sequencing or rna sequencing  <cit> . so far, transcriptome sequences have been generated using next generation sequencing so far from northern highbush  <cit> , half-high  <cit> , and southern highbush blueberry  <cit> . however, the information is still limited regarding the control of horticultural traits such as the molecular regulation mechanisms of blueberry maturation and flavonoid metabolism.

in order to gain new insights into molecular mechanism at transcriptome level, we performed transcriptome sequencing and gene expression profiling for the northern highbush blueberry variety ‘sierra’ over berry development with illumina sequencing technique. a total of more than  <dig>  gbp of data were generated and assembled into  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  unigenes. large numbers of simple sequence repeats  and candidate genes, which are potentially involved in plant growth, metabolic and hormone pathways, were identified. in addition, rna-seq expression profiles and functional annotations have been made publicly available . we believe that this study provides a new and more powerful resource for interpretation of high-throughput gene expression data for blueberry species.

RESULTS
sequence analysis and de novo assembly
the high quality illumina sequencing data produced from vaccinium corymbosum ‘sierra’ during fruit and color development has been deposited in ncbi sra database under accession number: srr <dig>  three independent cdna libraries were constructed from rna samples of green fruit , pink fruit  and blue fruit , respectively. in total, after removing adaptor sequences, ambiguous nucleotides and low-quality sequences,  <dig> , <dig> independent reads  with more than 92 % q <dig> bases were selected using illumina hiseq™  <dig> from the three samples . the gc content of the three samples was approximately 46 %.table  <dig> sequencing the blueberry transcriptome at different stages of fruit development

fruits at developmental stages of green, pink, and blue were sampled for transcriptome sequencing




using the trinity de novo assembly program  <cit> , we assembled the short read sequences from the three samples into  <dig>  transcripts. an overview of the assembled transcripts and unigenes are exhibited in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the n <dig> value of the three sample assemblies was 1688 bp, and  <dig>   <dig>  transcripts were longer than 1 kb. the transcripts were subjected to cluster and assembly analyses, resulting in  <dig>  unigenes , among which  <dig>   genes were greater than 1 kb. this is about  <dig> times greater than that in a previous report where a  <dig>  ests resulted in a total of  <dig> unigenes from two samples by sanger sequencing  <cit> . li et al. reported  <dig>  unigenes in half-high blueberry from their two fruit samples   <cit> . gupta et al. produced around  <dig>  gene models from five stages of berry fruit development and ripening  <cit> . therefore, we believe that the  <dig>  gbp of data generated and  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  unigenes assembled in this study are an important advancement and new resource for interpretation of high-throughput data for blueberry species whether regarding sequencing data depth or species extension. it is noteworthy that we have compared our dataset with the previously published illumina dataset  <cit> . compared with the previously published dataset, our dataset has a higher amount of data , better data quality , and better assembly results  . there is no doubt that we now have a more powerful information database with higher capacity for gene expression analysis in vaccinium, especially for fruit development and maturation, flavonoid metabolism and regulation and breeding for more healthful blueberries.table  <dig> the transcripts of blueberry





similarity analysis
in order to better evaluate the similarity between blueberry and other organisms, blueberry unigenes were submitted to the non-redundant  ncbi database for blastx similarity analysis. the results showed that vaccinium corymbosum unigenes hit a wide range of plant species including vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa, prunus avium, ricinus communis, fragaria vesca, jatropha curcas, solanum lycopersicum, solanum lycopersicum, camellia sinensis, gossypium hirsutum, brassica rapa, vaccinium macrocarpon, etc. . among them, interestingly,  <dig>   unigenes showed a significant homology with sequences of vitis vinifera, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigene sequences had a high similarity with those of populus trichocarpa and prunus avium, respectively. the high similarity of unigenes between vaccinium corymbosum and vitis vinifera suggests the possibility of using vitis vinifera transcriptomes and genomes as a reference sequence for vaccinium corymbosum. in contrast, only  <dig>  unigenes had a high similarity with sequences of vaccinium macrocarpon, probably owing to the insufficient number of sequences in genebank.fig.  <dig> species distribution of the top blast hits in nr database. values were number of unigenes in vaccinium corymbosum homologous with those in other species such as vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa, prunus avium, ricinus communis, fragaria vesca, jatropha curcas, solanum lycopersicum, solanum lycopersicum, camellia sinensis, gossypium hirsutum, brassica rapa, vaccinium macrocarpon





sequence annotation
to annotate the assembled sequences, several complementary approaches were utilized. the unigenes were annotated by aligning with the deposited ones in diverse protein databases  and the best one was selected from the matches with an e-value of less than 10− <dig>  the overall functional annotation is described in table  <dig>  among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes had significant matches in the cog and go database,  <dig>   in the nt database, and  <dig>   in the swiss-prot database. the  <dig>   unigenes were annotated in the nr, nt, swiss-prot, kegg, cog, go and trembl databases.table  <dig> annotation of blueberry unigenes




go, cog, kegg annotation
gene ontology  enrichment analysis was carried out to classify gene functions of the unigenes identified. the majority of the go terms  were assigned to biological process, and  <dig>   and  <dig>   were assigned to the molecular function and the cellular component, respectively . it was noteworthy that cells and organelles are highly represented in category of cellular components, while binding and catalytic activity are highly typical in molecular functions category. for biological processes, genes implicated in metabolic processes and cellular processes are the most represented category followed by the response to stimulus and biological regulation . these data suggest that the active synthesis of substance and energy and metabolic process are present in a wide variety of organelles and associated with fruit development and in response to stress during fruit ripening.fig.  <dig> functional annotation of assembled sequences based on gene ontology  categorization. a total of  <dig>  unigenes with blast match to known proteins were assigned to three main categories:  <dig>   were assigned to biological process, and  <dig>   and  <dig>   were assigned to the molecular function and the cellular component, respectively


fig.  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups  classification. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to the cog classification according to the nr database and grouped into  <dig> cog classifications




furthermore, all blueberry unigenes were searched against the cog database for functional prediction and classification. overall,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to the cog classification . the largest group was the cluster for general function prediction , followed by translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , replication, recombination and repair , transcription , posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones , signal transduction mechanisms , and carbohydrate transport and metabolism . however, small clusters were for cell motility and nuclear structure . in addition, no unigene was assigned to extracellular structures.

to characterize the active biological pathways in blueberry, kegg pathway tool was used as an alternative approach to analyze the pathway annotations of unigene sequences. the  <dig> unigenes were assigned to  <dig> biological pathways . these predicted pathways are responsible for growth and development probably via compound biosynthesis, degradation, utilization, and assimilation. these results suggest that a large number of metabolic activities are occurring during fruit development and coloring of blueberry.

est-ssr discovery
as highly informative markers, ssrs have developed into powerful molecular markers for comparative genetic mapping and genotyping among species within genera  <cit> . to date, ssrs are most widely applied in genetics, evolution and breeding.

to explore est-ssr profiles in the unigenes of blueberry,  <dig>  unigene sequences were submitted to search for ssrs. a total of  <dig> sequences containing  <dig> ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unigenes, with  <dig> unigene sequences containing more than one ssr . di-nucleotide motifs and tri-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant with  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively. the most abundant repeat type was ag/ct , followed by aag/ctt , agg/cct , and acc/ggt . because ssrs within genes are likely to be subjected to stronger selective pressure than other genomic regions, these ssrs probably represent different putative functions  <cit> . therefore, the unigenes yielded from blueberry are a larger resource for ssr mining than ever and the ssr profiles which we explored are a powerful platform for research in genetics, evolution and molecular marker-assistant breeding, etc.table  <dig> frequency of est-ssrs in blueberry




analysis of gene regulation in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway using the assembled unigenes
in this study, we analyzed all unigene annotation in blueberry. some genes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis were screened for further analysis. anthocyanins are a large class of flavonoids which are responsible for the colors of flowers, fruits and other tissues  <cit> . a simple anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is shown in fig.  <dig>  in most of the pathway, more than one unique sequence was annotated as encoding the same enzyme, especially the final step involving 3-glycoside formation by ufgt  .fig.  <dig> a schematic representation of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway




the relative expression levels of candidate unigenes and the content of anthocyanins during blueberry fruit and color development
to validate the results from the bioinformatics analysis, the expression profile of  <dig> differentially expressed genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway such as pal, c4h, 4cl, chs, chi, f3h, dfr, ans, and ufgt were tested by rt-qpcr using cdna templates from different fruit growth stages . the number of unigenes assumed to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is shown in additional file 4: file s <dig> and the specific primers used for rt-qpcr reactions are listed in table  <dig>  among them, five candidate genes covered over  <dig> unigenes. the transcripts of some genes such as chs, chi, f3h, dfr, dfr, ans, and ufgt increased with fruit coloring  and reached the highest level at red fruit stage , then slightly declined with fruit maturation . chs showed significant increase in expression at the stage of fruit coloring , about a 19-fold increase compared with green fruit , whereas only  <dig> -fold increase was observed for ans at the stage of red fruit . on the contrary, the expression level of pal, c4h, and 4cl changed little with fruit development. jaakola et al. reported the expression level of chs, f3h, dfr, and ans, detected by northern-blotting, to increase dramatically at stage  <dig>  in bilberry  <cit> . this is consistent with our results. zifkin et al. characterized the expression level of dfr, ans, anr, and lar in blueberry and found that the expression of dfr, ans increased at the s <dig> stage   <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression levels of the color-related genes and the content of anthocyanins in blueberry. total rna was extracted from green, pink and blue fruits, respectively. each value is the mean ± se of three independent biological determinations





the anthocyanin content was next quantified at different developmental stages to test if anthocyanins accumulate in accordance with the pattern of gene expression. as expected, at green berry stage, anthocyanins were detected at low levels, only  <dig>  mg/g fw. in accordance with the deep coloration, in mature fruits  the levels of anthocyanin peaked dramatically. analysis of expression and anthocyanin accumulation indicated that there was a significant correlation between the expression profile of candidate genes and the accumulation of anthocyanins.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the transcriptome and gene expression profiling over fruit development and coloring of blueberry were initiated by means of illumina sequencing. a total of approximately  <dig>  gbp of data were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  unigenes from three stages of blueberry fruit. a large number of simple sequence repeats  and candidate genes were identified. a total of  <dig> sequences containing  <dig> ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unigenes, and  <dig> unigenes containing more than one ssr. compared with the previously published data, our dataset has a higher amount of data , better data quality , and better assembly results . therefore, our high quality reads produced in this study are an important advancement and a new resource for interpretation of high-throughput data for blueberry species regarding from sequencing data depth or species extension.
