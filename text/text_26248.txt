BACKGROUND
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors  are ligand-dependent transcription factors that activate target genes by binding to peroxisome proliferator response elements  as heterodimers with the retinoid × receptor  . three ppar isoforms encoded by different genes have been identified: α , δ/β  and γ . the functional specificity among members of the ppar subfamily is achieved by isoform-specific tissue expression as well as ligand binding specificity  <cit> . endogenous ligands that activate ppars are polyunsaturated fatty acids or their derivatives  <cit> . ligand activation of ppars induces conformational changes that promote binding of co-activators that are essential for the trans-activating function whereas binding of nuclear co-repressors is associated with transcriptional repression. pparδ is the only isoform that maintains repressor activity when bound to dna. it has been reported that unligated pparδ can act as an intrinsic transcription repressor and inhibit the trans-activation activity of other ppars  <cit> . given that the pparδ gene is ubiquitously expressed this suggests an additional role for pparδ as a receptor whose relative level of expression can be used to repress the expression of ppre target genes.

it was not until recently that the roles of pparδ were disclosed through utilization of specific ligands together with relevant cells and animal models. pparδ controls various physiological functions including lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . pparδ-deficiency in mice negatively affects growth, adipose stores, epidermal cell proliferation, and myelinisation of corpus callosum  <cit> . treatment of insulin-resistant obese rhesus monkeys with a pparδ specific ligand has been shown to promote cholesterol efflux, increase hdl levels and decrease ldl, triglyceride and insulin levels  <cit> . further, pparδ is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, and treatment with pparδ specific ligands increases the proportion of oxidative slow-twitch myofibers and induces expression of genes involved in fatty acid utilization and oxidation as well as glucose uptake and metabolism  <cit> .

little is so far known considering how the expression of pparδ itself is regulated. here we report on new 5'-untranslated exons and multiple 5'-utrs of pparδ mrna transcripts, with an impact on the translation efficiency. in addition, we report on the expression of a 3'-splice variant of human pparδ , encoding a potential dominant negative regulator of gene expression. since alternative splicing contributes to the regulation of gene expression and constitutes an important source of evolutionary diversity, we hypothesize that spliced mrna isoforms of human pparδ play a role in controlling its function.

RESULTS
multiple untranslated exons and alternative transcription start sites
we have previously reported the human pparδ gene to encompass  <dig> exons of which exons 1– <dig>  the 5'-end of exon  <dig> and the 3'-end of exon  <dig> are untranslated  <cit> . an investigation was conducted aiming to identify possible alternative 5'-ends in transcripts of pparδ. five new 5'-untranslated exons in alternatively spliced transcripts of human pparδ mrna were identified. the locations of these exons  in the gene sequence are outlined in figure 1a. the newly identified exons were found at different time-points during the investigation and were subsequently re-annotated to indicate the relative position of each exon in the gene. exons 2a, 2c and 2e were originally found by 5'-race using marathon cdnas from placenta, adipose tissue and pancreas. combinations of these exons, including differently spliced forms of exon 2a, were found to be spliced-in generating a variety of 5'-utrs, as displayed in figure 1b. exons 2b and 2d were subsequently found among sequenced pcr fragments generated using marathon cdnas and cell-derived cdnas as templates and different combinations of 5'-untranslated exon-specific primers. the genomic locations and sequences of the splice junctions of spliced-in exons are summarized in table  <dig>  none of the 5'-utrs found in this study contains any new in-frame coding regions. thus, the open reading frame  region encoded by exons  <dig> to  <dig> remains identical in all 5'-spliced transcripts.

the genomic positions of exons were deduced using the human pparδ refseq . upper-case and lower-case letters indicate exon and intron sequences, respectively. the consensus splice donor-acceptor sequences are in bold letters.

the majority of the 5'-splice pparδ transcripts contain exon  <dig> in the 5'-end. however, alternative 5'-ends associated with exons 2a, 2c and 2e were found, which is illustrated in figure 1b, 5'-utrs: h-k. of these, the alternative 5'-end containing full-length exon 2c was found only in pancreas  whereas the others could be found in all three marathon cdnas. the genomic locations and sequences of the alternative 5'-end exons are summarized in table  <dig> 

the genomic positions of exons were deduced using the human pparδ refseq . upper-case and lower-case letters indicate exon and intron sequences, respectively. the consensus splice donor sequences are in bold letters. the relative positions of 5'-ends in the gene are also illustrated in figure 1b, 5'-utrs denoted h-k.

a bioinformatic approach to identify splice variants of human pparδ using the ncbi human genome browser and the human est-search tool, indeed, showed the presence of exons 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d among 5'-spliced transcripts of pparδ, all with exons  <dig> and/or  <dig> upstream.

expression of pparδ 5'-utr isoforms in human cell lines and tissues
total rna extracted from five different human cell lines was analysed by rt-pcr using different combinations of exon-specific pparδ primers. the presence of pparδ transcripts containing exons 2a, 2c and 2e in all cell lines was confirmed by sequencing of pcr products . real-time pcr was subsequently conducted to estimate the relative amount of isoforms containing exons 2a, 2c and 2e among transcripts of pparδ mrnas. samples of cdna from human cell lines and from human skeletal muscle tissue as well as from adult and fetal heart tissues were subjected to taqman analysis using primers and probes specified in table  <dig>  the analysis, illustrated in figure  <dig>  showed that in all cell lines and tissues studied the most common splice variant contained exons  <dig> and  <dig> joined together  in the 5'-utr. this variant was expressed in the same order of magnitude as the total amount of full length pparδ detected with primers targeting exons  <dig> and  <dig> . transcripts containing exon  <dig> joined to exon 2a  were expressed at a much lower level in all cell lines and tissues even though the level of expression varied and was higher in hela cells compared to skeletal muscle. the expression levels of transcripts containing isoforms joining exons 2c and  <dig>  as well as exons  <dig> and 2e  were below the detection limit in all the cell lines and tissues studied.

the primers and probes are annotated according to the target exons and exon/exon junctions in the human pparδ gene, respectively.

real-time pcr on cdna from human cell lines  and human tissues  using primers and probes specified in table  <dig> was performed as described in "methods". the following combinations of primers and probes were used for each taqman assay; tqex8fw, tqex9rev and ex8:9pr ; tqex2fw, tqex4rev and ex2:4pr ; tqex2fw, tqex2arev and ex2:2apr ; tqex2cfw, tqex3rev and ex2c:3pr ; tqex2fw, tqex2erev and ex2:2epr . the result of each assay was normalized to the result of the ex8: <dig> assay using the comparative ct method and presented as the mean relative expression levels .

analysis of promoter activities
the majority of the 5'-splice pparδ transcripts identified contain exon  <dig> in the 5'-end, indicating that the previously identified promoter region upstream of exon  <dig> is the major region for transcriptional regulation of the human pparδ gene  <cit> . this was confirmed by transient transfection assays in both huh <dig> and hela cells using a range of reporter gene constructs containing  <dig>  kb to  <dig> bp of the dna sequence upstream of exon  <dig> . maximum luciferase activity was obtained with the reporter construct containing  <dig> bp of the promoter in both cell lines . shorter constructs showed declining activities with a major drop using the  <dig> bp construct. likewise, longer constructs showed decreasing luciferase activities, indicating the presence of upstream transcriptional repressor element.

reporter gene constructs encompassing approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> bp, respectively, of the 5'-regions of each of the four putative transcription start sites  showed no or weak basal promoter activity in huh <dig> and hela cells compared with the identified promoter region upstream of exon  <dig> . in silico analysis revealed a potential ppre located - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the identified alternative 5'-end within exon 2a. however, the two reporter gene constructs  containing this ppre were neither affected by overexpression of pparδ nor pparα combined with isoform-specific ligands gw <dig>  <cit>  and fibrates, respectively .

translation efficiency of pparδ 5'-splice variants
the impact of different 5'-utrs on the translation efficiency was analysed using coupled transcription/translation in a reticulocyte system . plasmids harbouring seven different 5'-utrs  placed in front of the pparδ coding region were analysed. the compiled results outlined in figure  <dig> clearly show that transcripts with extended 5'-utrs are less efficiently translated into protein. the methionine labelled translation products were resolved by sds-page and subjected to autoradiography . western blot analysis of the translated protein , using a pparδ specific antibody, showed immunoreactive proteins of compatible sizes  and intensities as the autoradiogram . the intensities of the methionine and western blot bands were quantified . the alternatively spliced human pparδ 5'-utrs differ in length and number of augs. all identified upstream augs are upstream open reading frames  with an in-frame stop codon within the 5'-utrs. the 5'-utr sequences analysed harbour from  <dig> up to  <dig> upstream augs . strong inverse relationships were observed between the number of augs and the measure of quantified translation efficiency   whereas that between the 5'-utr length and % area was less pronounced .

c. quantification of the methionine labelled band intensities was performed on the autoradiographic  and western blot  bands using the nih imagej software. the relative intensities of signals  were calculated setting the signal of construct a to 100%. the number of upstream augs and the total length of each 5'-utr is given below each bar of calculated signal.

characterization of the truncated human pparδ isoform 
a 3'-spliced isoform of human pparδ, formed by exon  <dig> skipping, has been reported from human placenta cdna clones . intron  <dig> is retained in the primary transcript and an in-frame stop codon  in the extended exon  <dig> encodes a protein lacking the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of pparδ, which constitutes the end of the ligand-binding domain. the presence of a pparδ <dig> transcript  with a polyadenylation signal  <dig> nt downstream of the stop codon and a polytail attached was confirmed by 3'-race using cdna from placenta and adipose tissue . adaptor linked transcripts with a 3'-end within intron  <dig> were also obtained from pancreas cdna, however, polytail linked 3'-end transcripts could not be confirmed.

pcr amplification of placenta and adipose 5'-race products enriched in either full-length pparδ  or pparδ <dig>  respectively, revealed some differences regarding the variety of untranslated exons among 5'-utrs, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  a sequence within the coding region  as well as sequences encompassing exons  <dig> to  <dig> and exons  <dig> to  <dig> could be amplified using all 5'-race products . transcripts containing exons  <dig>  2a, 2c, and 2e  appeared, on the other hand, to be absent in samples enriched in pparδ <dig> 

to analyse the trans-activating ability of pparδ <dig>  the pfabpluc reporter activity was investigated during overexpression of pparδ <dig> in the absence or presence of the expression vector for full-length pparδ  and the pparδ specific ligand gw <dig>  <cit> . co-transfection of pfabpluc and the expression vector for pparδ <dig> in hela cells and treatment with gw <dig>  increased the trans-activation ability in a dose-dependent manner . pparδ <dig>  on the other hand, had no trans-activation ability in the presence of gw <dig>  but rather repressed the ligand-induced activation of pfabpluc reporter by pparδ <dig> . the expression of pparδ <dig> and pparδ <dig>  respectively, in transfected hela cells was confirmed by western blot analysis showing immunoreactive bands of expected sizes  . gel retardation analysis showed that full-length pparδ <dig> binds to the functional ppre of the rat acyl-coa oxidase gene in the presence of rxr whereas pparδ <dig> does not bind .

comparative genomics
the human and mouse pparδ refseqs were compared and revealed an overall conserved pattern of exons and introns. two 5'-untranslated exons are conserved between the human and mouse genes as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the mouse exon 1a, previously reported to be positioned upstream of exon 1b  <cit> , was found to be located downstream of exon  <dig> in the mouse refseq. the two genes harbour six and three, respectively, species-specific 5'-untranslated exons. all these exons, except for mouse exon 1c, are located between exon  <dig> and the first coding exon, a region with no apparent sequence conservation between species. comparative analysis using the ecr browser tool  <cit> , on the other hand, revealed regions of conservation relative to the human pparδ gene in the chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and dog orthologous genes as depicted in figure  <dig>  the genomic positions of the human pparδ exons 2a and 2e within evolutionary conserved regions and of exons 2b, 2c and 2d within repetitive regions are indicated in figure  <dig>  repetitive regions are masked prior to comparative analysis of conserved region in the ecr browser alignment and thus excluded from comparison. using clustalw alignment the masked regions harbouring the sequences of the orthologous exons 2b and 2c in chimpanzee, macaque and dog revealed an overall sequence identity of 98%, 59% and 15%, respectively, compared with the human pparδ counterpart, as indicated in figure  <dig>  the masked region containing exon 2d, on the other hand, showed no sequence similarity between species. identity scores and lengths of matching sequences to the human exons identified in the pparδ gene of chimpanzee, macaque and dog are given in table  <dig> 

identity scores were calculated by clustalw alignments and include scores for the novel human pparδ exons and human exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> and coding exons  for comparison. exon  <dig> was not included since complete sequence information for this exon is not available for all species. scores given in italic numbers indicate a sequence without conserved splice junctions.

* sequence comparison precluded by unsequenced gaps in the macaque pparδ gene

†a full-length exon is not conserved. identity scores are given for a sequence homologous to the 3'-region of the comparable human exon

‡ an orthologous exon was not identified. identity scores are given for a sequence with the highest homology scores within the genomic region comparable to the location of the human exon

the overall sequence conservation between human and chimpanzee pparδ genes is pronounced. moreover, the ncbi homologene database displays two isoforms of chimpanzee pparδ mrna, denoted isoforms  <dig>  and  <dig> , which harbour spliced forms of exon 2a.

the major process whereby new exons evolve is considered to be exonization of intronic sequences  <cit> . the primate specific alu-elements can be exonized through a small number of mutations. using the repeatmasker to analyse the human pparδ gene, exon 2b was found to fulfil the criteria of being an alu-derived exon  <cit> . similar antisense alu-elements are present in the corresponding region of the chimpanzee and macaque genes, both with mutations to enable exonization of orthologous exon 2b. a second exon-associated alu-element is present in the 5'-end of exon 2c, close to the alternative 5'-end identified in pancreas. this alu-element is conserved in the chimpanzee pparδ gene. exon 2d is located within a sva element , named after its main components; short interspread nuclear element , variable number of tandem repeats  and alu  <cit> . in general this subfamily of sva elements is believed to predate the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineage but is not present in the chimpanzee pparδ gene. exon 2d is thus truly a human specific exon.

homologues to the human pparδ <dig> isoform are presented in the ncbi genbank as isoform models for both chimpanzee and macaque . the stop codon and the polyadenylation signal in intron  <dig> are fully conserved in the pparδ genes of these primates. the potential 3'-utrs of chimpanzee and macaque pparδ <dig> show 99% and 94% overall sequence identity to the human counterpart, respectively. this pronounced sequence conservation indicates that pparδ <dig> could be a primate specific isoform.

discussion
a diversity of 5'-utrs derived from alternative splicing was identified among human pparδ mrnas in this study. the majority of 5'-utrs have exon  <dig> in the 5'-end, and reporter gene analysis using huh <dig> and hela cells suggests that the main promoter of human pparδ is positioned upstream of exon  <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> , this promoter does not have a consensus tata-box but is rich in potential sp- <dig> binding elements, a typical feature for house-keeping genes. this region contains evolutionary conserved areas between the human and mouse pparδ genes. alternative promoters could, however, be present in the human pparδ gene, as is the case for the mouse orthologous gene  <cit> . contrary to this assumption, reporter gene analysis using huh <dig> and hela cells showed a low promoter activity related to only one of the four alternative promoter regions tested. analysis of other cell types could, however, provide a different result. the identified alternative 5'-ends might represent tissue- or developmental-specific alternative transcription starts sites or be the products of as yet unknown post-transcriptional processing. a tissue-specific alternative transcription start site could apply to one alternative 5'-end, which was detected only in cdna from pancreas.

several levels of regulation of ppar activity have been reported such as phosphorylation by kinases that affects the transactivation potential and ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, a mechanism to arrest transcriptional activation  <cit> . the post-transcriptional regulation by 5'-splicing suggested here for human pparδ and previously reported for the mouse orthologous gene  <cit>  could represent one additional level of regulation. at least eight exons can be included in the 5'-utr region of human pparδ transcripts by alternative splicing; the previously identified exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and the five exons  identified in this study. the untranslated human pparδ exons are not mutually exclusive but rather appear to be spliced-in forming a diversity of 5'-utrs containing any combination of exons. in addition to the splice variants discussed and depicted in figure 1b, ten more combinations involving the herein identified untranslated exons and the previously reported untranslated exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been observed, either by sequencing of pcr products in this study or in data from the human est-data base. the newly identified exons are positioned within the  <dig> kb long sequence separating exon  <dig> and the first coding exon. interestingly, all ppar isoforms share a similar gene organization with long introns separating untranslated exons from coding exons. the presence of several new splice variants affecting the 5'-utr region of pparγ was recently reported  <cit> . likewise multiple isoforms of human pparα with variable 5'-utrs are presented in the ncbi homologene database.

different combinations of 5'-untranslated human pparδ exons form 5'-utrs of various length and numbers of upstream augs. the originally postulated scanning mechanism for initiation of translation predicts that translation should be initiated at the first aug codon closest to the 5'-end of the mrna  <cit> . however, upstream augs that are followed by a run of codons that ends in a termination codon within the 5'-utr, so called upstream open reading frames , play a role in translational regulation  <cit> . the strong correlation between the number of upstream augs and the observed translation efficiency indicates that the regulation of the yield of pparδ per unit mrna involves uorfs. an influence on translation by gc rich regions with a potential to form stable secondary structures in the more extended 5'-utrs cannot be ruled out. the possibility of an initiation of translation by internal ribosomal entry sites  that circumvents upstream aug codons and secondary structures is intriguing. the presence of ires in the 5'-utrs of many growth regulatory genes is believed to provide a means for the tuning of their translation in time and space and in response to relevant stimuli  <cit> .

our results and available human est data suggest a ubiquitous occurrence of the newly identified exons in human pparδ mrnas. quantification using real-time pcr, however, showed that the overall preferred 5'-utr is short, containing only exons  <dig> and  <dig>  thus representing the majority of the human pparδ transcripts. besides this, only mrna isoforms containing exon 2a are present in measurable amounts. considering that the presence of full-length exon 2a contributes substantially to the reduced translation efficiency, it is tempting to speculate that occurrence of exon 2a might be of importance for the functional roles of human pparδ.

the generation rate of new exons has been calculated to approximately  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per gene per million years  <cit> . most new exons are considered to originate from exonization of intronic sequences and appear in minor splice forms, which is in agreement with the finding in this study. an important question that remains to be answered is whether the low-abundant splice variants containing the newly identified exons represent biologically significant and functional isoforms. comparative genomics was used as a guide to identify conserved sequence element, considering that functional regions generally are under strong selection pressure to stay unchanged. the previously identified untranslated exons  <dig> and  <dig> are highly conserved between species whereas the newly identified human pparδ exons are either human- or primate-specific exons. exon 2d was identified as a human-specific exon. all other novel exons are highly conserved in chimpanzee whereas only two exons  show the same high conservation in macaque. likewise, all features related to the four alternative 5'-ends identified for the human pparδ are fully conserved in chimpanzee whereas only one, the 5'-end related to exon 2a, is preserved in the macaque. at present, however, there is no available est data to predict alternative splicing or promoter usage of pparδ in chimpanzee or macaque.

the sequence of exon 2a appears to be the most conserved of the five new human pparδ exons. all features related to this exon, including internal splice junctions and a putative 5'-end, are fully conserved in both the chimpanzee and macaque genes. alternative splicing involving a homologous exon 2a in chimpanzee is suggested by available pparδ isoforms for this species. the overall conservation of the exon 2a sequence is surprisingly high in the dog gene. however, it is highly unlikely that an orthologous exon is spliced in this species.

taken together, it is likely that transcripts with a short 5'-utr provide a constant basal level of pparδ synthesis. transcripts with extended 5'-utrs, such as the mrna isoforms containing full-length exon 2a, with multiple aug codons and potential secondary structures, could provide a spatio-temporal regulation of protein expression during for example growth, development, differentiation and stress. it has been reported that dysregulation of key proteins regulating growth and differentiation via modulation of 5'-utr activity plays a role in the development or progression of various forms of cancer  <cit> . whether mechanisms related to alternative splicing of pparδ could contribute to the conflicting findings regarding the role of this nuclear factor in cancer development remains to be investigated  <cit> . likewise, the role of alternative promoters in the regulation of human pparδ gene expression is a matter to consider in future studies.

the possibility of a dominant negative variant of the human pparδ adds to the complexity of pparδ as a transcriptional regulator. the alternative polyadenylation signal and premature stop-codon in human pparδ intron  <dig> are not conserved in mouse, indicating that this isoform is human-specific, similar to the dominant negative variants of pparα and pparγ  <cit> . suggested orthologs of the human pparδ <dig> in chimpanzee and macaque, on the other hand, indicate that this could be a primate-specific isoform. investigation of 5'-utrs among human pparδ <dig> transcripts shows that this isoform, similar to full-length pparδ, is preferentially transcribed from a promoter upstream of exon  <dig>  since the variability among 5'-utrs of pparδ <dig> is less pronounced, this isoform appears to be less subjected to alternative splicing and thus translational regulation.

transcripts of pparδ <dig> were identified in placenta and adipose tissue. the occurrence and functional implications of pparδ <dig> transcripts translated into protein in different cells and tissues, however, remains to be elucidated. here we have shown for the first time in vitro that the isoform pparδ <dig> represses the trans-activating ability of full-length pparδ. the mode of action of dominant negative nuclear receptors in general is either competition for binding of dna, auxiliary factors and cofactors or an effect on subcellular localization. a dominant negative mutant of the full-length mouse orthologous of pparδ  has been tested in a similar setting with a ppre reporter gene construct and gw <dig>  and shown to dose-dependently inhibit pparδ induced luciferase activity. contrary to pparδ <dig> this full-length mutant is suggested to bind ligand and ppre but remains in a repressive form and acts by competing with wild type pparδ for binding to dna  <cit> . the result of the mobility shift assay presented here indicates that pparδ <dig> exerts its inhibitory properties by another mechanism than competition for binding to ppres.

CONCLUSIONS
the main finding of this study is the demonstration of multiple 5'-utr splice variants of pparδ mrna that can influence the translation capacity. moreover, the alternative splicing of human pparδ is also reflected by the generation of a dominant negative isoform. considering that pparδ is widely expressed, a master regulator of gene transcription and acts as a metabolic sensor, proper understanding of the factors affecting the expression level and activity of this nuclear receptor is of crucial importance. dysregulation of alternative splicing might promote human disease  <cit> . in the case of human pparδ, this would entail dysregulation of protein expression with effects on both the trans-activating and repressor potentials of pparδ.
