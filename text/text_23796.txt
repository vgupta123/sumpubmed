BACKGROUND
probiotics, “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”  <cit> , have shown favourable properties in maintaining oral health. short- and long-term intake of probiotics could reduce the caries risk among children  <cit> , decrease gum bleeding and reduce gingivitis , reduce the pocket depth and positively affect the gain of clinical attachment  <cit> , and reduce the counts of candida in the elderly  <cit> . collective studies suggest that these positive effects are results of the interactions between probiotics and the micro-organisms harboured in individual’s oral cavity.

micro-organisms inhabit the oral cavity in the form of biofilms , which progressively develop in 4 hours after meals in the absence of oral hygiene  <cit> . a fully developed biofilm contains micro-organisms, extracellular matrix and extracellular dna  <cit> . initial colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces bind to the salivary pellicle, which coats the enamel, subsequently grow together with secondary colonizers, and gradually develop biofilm communities  <cit> . in these mature biofilms communications of intra-species and interspecies occur on nutrition metabolism, space arrangement, and transfer of dna  <cit> .

daily oral hygiene, including tooth brushing and flossing, could remove most of the dental plaque, but the residual plaque, however, is still unavoidable. in the plaque, when certain harmful strains grow in greater numbers, they may contribute and cause oral diseases, such as tooth decay, periodontitis and candidiasis  <cit> . also poor daily oral hygiene may increase the chronic inflammatory burden to the body  <cit> . according to accumulating data from clinical trials, probiotics have shown capacity to be an alternative strategy for the prevention and treatment of bacterial/yeast diseases  <cit> . in the past decade, researchers have investigated the antagonistic interactions between probiotics and pathogens in their planktonic form in broth media and/or in colonies on agars  <cit> . advanced biofilm models  have been built up to test their activities when grown on glass and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  surfaces. despite great efforts, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of probiotic behaviour is still inadequate, however. as mixed-species biofilms are undoubtedly the dominant form in nature and the oral cavity, there are pressing needs to discover behaviours of bacteria and yeasts in a more complex system. however, seldom studies investigated the effects of probiotics on multiple species biofilms. pham et al.  <cit>  have studied the effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus salivarius w <dig> on saliva-derived microcosmos. but no studies have reported effects of probiotics on defined multi-species biofilms, which allow us to follow the changes of each strain. therefore, in this in vitro study we tested the abilities of six strains to form and build up biofilms on saliva-coated ha discs in six mono-species groups, in three dual-species groups , and in four multi-species groups , respectively. we aimed to explore the ability of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to integrate in biofilms and influence its species composition in multiple species biofilms.

RESULTS
growth
the growth abilities of the six strains in  <dig> groups are presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  l.gg, c. albicans, s. mutans, and s. sanguinis were able to build up biofilms in mono-species culture after three days cultivation, but a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum were not. they were detected only at  <dig>  hours. the total numbers of viable cells in dual- and multi- species groups were generally higher than in mono-species groups. the greatest cell numbers from  <dig> -hour-old biofilms appeared in groups 5sp and 5sp + l.gg , and the cell numbers were significantly higher  than in all other groups , except group sm .fig.  <dig> total number of viable cells  from biofilms and the increase ratios in self-development stage. tnvc of sm group at  <dig>  h was significantly higher  than tnvc of the rest of the groups at  <dig>  h, and marked as ‘*’. tnvc of 5sp and 5sp + l.gg at  <dig>  h were significantly higher  than tnvc of the rest of the groups  at  <dig>  h, and marked as ‘*'’. data represent the means ± sds

increase ratios of total viable cells in groups of 5sp and 5sp + l.gg were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which were higher  than in the other groups. the ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in group 4sp, while it decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the presence of l.gg. this increase ratio was lower  than  <dig>  in the groups l.gg , ss  and l.gg + ss , respectively.

l.gg grew best in the presence of c. albicans, and the corresponding increase ratio for l.gg was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which was significantly higher  than increase ratio in the other groups, except in group 4sp + l.gg .

c. albicans grew similarly in all groups. the highest increase ratio of viable c. albicans cells was detected in group 5sp , and the ratio slightly decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when c. albicans was co-cultured with l.gg. this decrease of c. albicans increase ratio also appeared in other pair groups, when l.gg was involved in the culture, namely groups ca  and ca + l.gg , groups 4sp  and 4sp + l.gg . percentage of the cell number of c. albcians in l.gg + ca at time point of  <dig>  h was decreased compared with the percentage at  <dig>  h .fig.  <dig> viable cell number  of the cultured strains. the cultured strains were l.gg, c. albcians , s. mutans , and s. sanguinis , in dual- and multi-species groups at  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h biofilms



s. mutans grew well in each group, and the viable cell numbers from all  <dig>  h-old biofilms reached the same level of 108 cfu/disc. a slight decrease in numbers of s. mutans viable cells from  <dig>  h-old biofilm was found in l.gg + sm biofilm , compared with its numbers in mono culture . the increase ratio of s. mutans in the  <dig> species biofilm was significantly higher  than s. mutans alone.

s. sanguinis grew better in multi-species groups compared to its growth in mono-species biofilm. the best growth was seen in 4sp group, but it was supressed by l.gg. in 4sp group, the number of viable cells from  <dig>  h-old biofilm was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 107 cfu/disc and the increase ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . but these values were significantly  decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  when l.gg was inoculated to the  <dig> species biofilm. percentage of cell numbers of s. sanguinis in 4sp + l.gg at  <dig>  h  was smaller than the percentage at  <dig>  h  . and numbers of viable s. sanguinis cell from  <dig>  h-old biofilms were lower than  <dig>  ×  <dig> and the increase ratios were lower than  <dig>  in all the other groups.

a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum were part of the cell suspensions inoculated to the multi-species biofilm system at 0 h, but their numbers were undetectable by the method used in this study and thus not compared with the other strains in figs.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  no viable cells were detected from the negative control biofilms, which were cultured with physiological saline on saliva-coated ha discs.

adhesion ratio
the highest adhesion ratio of l.gg appeared in group 4sp + l.gg  and lowest in group 5sp + l.gg . the adhesion ratios of c. albicans were slightly higher in the presence of l.gg, namely  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively. for s. mutans, this ratio, when co-cultured with l.gg , was only one third of the value in mono culture biofilm . in group 4sp + l.gg the adhesion ration of s. sanguinis was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and significantly higher  than that in mono- and dual- species biofilm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively.

ph values of spent media
to describe the environments where biofilms grew in, ph values of each spent media was measured and shown in fig.  <dig>  the ph values in groups sm and l.gg + sm varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which were significantly lower  than in the rest of the  <dig> groups, respectively at  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h time points. the ph values of l.gg in a mono culture decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h, and returned to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h. groups ca and ss showed similar behaviour, but the ph decrease at  <dig>  h was lower than  <dig> . values from groups aa and fn were stable in all the three time points .fig.  <dig> ph values of spent media in each group at  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h. data represent the means ± sds



multi-groups generally showed greater reductions of ph values than mono groups, except group sm. the ph values in the multi-species groups varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at  <dig>  h. at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h, ph values decreased to ~ <dig>  in 5sp and 5sp + l.gg, which were significantly lower  than the values in 4sp and 4sp + l.gg .

three dual-species groups  showed different changes of ph values. the ph values were the lowest in l.gg + sm . in the l.gg + ca group the value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h, and decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h. the ph values in l.gg + ss were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at  <dig>  h,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at all the three time points.

clsm images
from the clsm images shown in fig. 5a and 5b, the cell morphology of each strain in mono-species biofilms was able to be observed. in all dual-species groups, l.gg established well, which increased the difficulty to distinguish the cells of c. albicans, s. mutans, and s. sanguinis in the biofilms. the biofilms of 4sp group were mostly covered by f. nucleatum, and some of the cells were clearly seen in clusters, but f. nucleatum was sparsely attached to saliva-coated ha discs in the 4sp + l.gg group. in the biofilms images of 5sp and 5sp + l.gg, the cells grew in clusters and made it difficult to see the differences between the two groups. no cells were scanned in the negative control biofilms.fig.  <dig>

discussion
this in vitro study aimed to test if l.gg could establish in oral biofilms and intervene with their compositions. we built  <dig>  h mono-, dual-, and multi-species biofilms. our results show that l.gg was able to retain and proliferate in in vitro oral biofilms, and showed various effects on the growth of the  <dig> strains investigated in the biofilm models.

the ability to attach and develop biofilms in mono-culture was highly strain dependent. l.gg and s. mutans demonstrated stronger ability than the other strains  to adhere to saliva-coated ha discs in the model. l.gg, a well-studied strain, has been shown to be able to colonise the oral cavity for at least two weeks after discontinuation of consumption of the yoghurt  <cit> . and it has displayed good in vitro adherence not only to epithelial cells and mucus but also to abiotic surfaces  <cit> , which agrees with our result. but lebeer et al. also have pointed out that in vitro biofilm formation by l.gg was strongly modulated by culture medium factors. the explanation of the reduced viable counts of l.gg from  <dig>  h biofilm in our study is unclear. s. mutans showed the strongest adhesion ability, whereas s. sanguinis was sparsely bound to saliva-coated ha discs, and showed decreased counts of viable cells after the self-development stage. streptococcal species have been reported being one of the many etiological factors of dental caries, and have been considered as pioneer colonizers settled down to salivary proteins and glycoproteins adsorbed on tooth enamel  <cit> . s. mutans has a greater ability to form biofilm than the isolates of other streptococcus species colonising the human oral cavity  <cit> , which agrees with our result.

c. albicans showed good potential to build up the biofilms in mono culture, as the viable cells from biofilms grew twice more during the latter 48 h cultivation, although the numbers were much lower compared to the other strains at each time point. the original inoculum of c. albicans was ten times lower than the other strains under the same optical density at wave length of 490 nm , but its cell size was two times bigger than that of the other strains. in addition, different shapes of c. albicans were observed from clsm images. c. albicans, causing oral candidiasis, has been reported a polymorphic organism that can grow as yeast, pseudohyphae, and hyphae; and candida pathogenesis can be established by virtue of candida growth and yeast-to-hyphae morphogenesis  <cit> .

viable cells of a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum from the mono  <dig>  h biofilms did not grow out on bhi agar, but they were clearly seen in clsm images of  <dig>  h biofilms. the reason might be that they were in logarithmic decline phase in  <dig>  h biofilms, so that they were able to be seen in clsm images but not detectable on agar plates. both strains have been related to periodontitis  <cit>  and reported as late colonisers  <cit> , binding to receptors of pioneer colonisers. our results confirmed the ability of a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum to connect to saliva pellicle without the help of early colonisers, although the adhesion was weak. karched and coworkers  <cit>  also have proved that the aid of the first colonizers was not a necessary factor for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum to form biofilms in laboratory conditions.

to date only a limited number of studies have addressed mixed-species biofilms. results from the current study proved that strains, namely l.gg, c. albicans, s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum, with poor growth ability in mono-species biofilms demonstrated better abilities of adhesion and reproduction in dual- and/or multi-species biofilms. similar results have been reported in dual studies, s. gordonii and s. mutans have shown increased biofilm formation of c. albicans  <cit> . varposhti et al.  <cit>  have investigated biofilms of six respiratory tract pathogenic bacteria, and their results have indicated that the biofilm formation by two species was significantly greater than its production by any of the single species. roder and co-workers also found this phenomenon in four species combination isolated from meat chopper and kitchen wall  <cit> . they suggest that growing with neighbours is, in most cases, advantageous to the productivity of the community  <cit> . clinically it seems that biofilms actively attempt to become poly-microbial, apparently to improve their survivability  <cit> . behind these phenomena are intra- and inter-species communications, grouping into antagonistic and synergistic effects on microbial community members. the interactions described above clearly show synergistic results for whole communities.

in the last decade, researchers have focused on studying the antagonistic interactions between oral micro-organisms in planktonic and biofilm forms, in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . to our knowledge, our present study seems to be the first report to explore effects of probiotics on defined oral multi-species biofilms. in our model, l.gg slightly suppressed the increase ratio of c. albicans in all groups, markedly restrained the growth of s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum in 4sp + l.gg group, and slightly reduced the adhesion of s. mutans in l.gg + sm group in in vitro conditions. our results agree with previous in vitro studies. l.gg was able to inhibit the growth of oral pathogens and opportunistic pathogens in laboratory conditions  <cit> . this study is an agreement with the previous clinical findings showing that intake of probiotics could significantly reduce the caries risk, gingivitis, periodontal pocket depth and attachment loss, and the counts of yeasts .

interestingly, our results showed that c. albicans significantly promoted the growth of l.gg. the mechanism is unknown. c. albicans was revealed as a basal oral mycobiome member in healthy individuals by multitag  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> , but most studies relate it to diseases, such as oral candidiasis and vaginal yeast infections  <cit> . only few studies have reported its contribution to the balance of micro-ecology  <cit> . one explanation is that lactate, which is generated by l.gg  <cit> , poses harmful effects on itself, but c. albicans is able to metabolize it, and to reduce the accumulation and toxic level for l.gg in the environment  <cit> . beneficial effects of oral pathogens on lactobacilli have also been reported by filoche et al.  <cit>  by showing that actinomyces species and s. mutans were able to improve the growth of lactobacillus. the mechanism to this is unclear, however.

the ph value of the spent broth varied due to glucose fermentation and other metabolic activities of the micro-organisms on the surface of saliva coated ha discs, in the broth, and on the inner walls of 24-well-plates wells. our results showed that the number of viable cells in biofilms correlated with lower ph values. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, c. albicans and l.gg are well-known acid producers  <cit> . in the adhesion period, inoculated planktonic micro-organisms adjusted themselves to the new conditions in 24-well plates, and attached to the surface of the discs, but the numbers of detected viable cells from the discs were much lower than in the inoculations, thus indicating that the ph value measured at  <dig>  h was mainly contributed by planktonic form cells. in the self-development stage, attached biofilm cells were the only micro-organisms in the new wells. after 48 h cultivation biofilms became matured and spent media were filled with planktonic cells. both biofilms and planktonic cells affected the ph values of the spent media.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in this in vitro model, l.gg was able to integrate in all oral biofilms on saliva-coated ha discs, and reduced the growth of s. sanguinis, c. albicans, and lowered the biofilm-forming ability of f. nucleatum, but showed only minor effects on the adhesion of s. mutans. c. albicans significantly promoted the growth of l.gg. based on the findings in our study, we could surmise that plausible clinical implication of probiotics could be towards prevention and management of oral infectious diseases by alteration of biofilm composition.
