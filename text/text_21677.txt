BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids are the main component of the immunosuppressive treatment of canine idiopathic immune-mediated hemolytic anemia , but cytotoxic drugs such as azathioprine are advised for severe disease, such as cases with intravascular hemolysis or autoagglutination, and if the disease is refractory to glucocorticoids alone  <cit> . a few studies have evaluated the effect of azathioprine in canine imha and reported conflicting results, ranging from a possible beneficial effect to no effect  <cit> . cytotoxic drugs can have potentially severe side effects, such as bone marrow suppression  <cit>  and gastrointestinal disturbances, and long-term adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs in humans and animals include neoplasms, leukemia, and testicular and ovarian dysfunction  <cit> . similar problems have been reported in people working with these agents  <cit> . azathioprine is recognized by the international agency for research on cancer as being a possible or probable cancer-causing agent  <cit> .

we previously reported on the treatment of dogs with idiopathic imha with an immunosuppressive protocol consisting of azathioprine and prednisolone, at that time the standard treatment in our clinic  <cit> . the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect of azathioprine in canine idiopathic imha combined with concerns about the safety of the drug with regard to animal owners, animal caretakers, and veterinarians prompted the question whether the use of azathioprine is justified in dogs with idiopathic imha. the standard treatment protocol was revised from one including combined therapy with azathioprine and prednisolone to one including prednisolone monotherapy. after several years, we now have sufficient documented cases to compare the efficacy of the two protocols. the aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the outcome and survival of dogs with idiopathic imha treated according to a protocol including azathioprine and prednisolone  versus a protocol including prednisolone alone .

RESULTS
clinical characteristics of dogs
of  <dig> dogs eligible for the p protocol,  <dig> met exclusion criteria and  <dig> further dogs were excluded because they switched from the p protocol to the ap protocol, leaving  <dig> dogs in the p protocol group. of the  <dig> dogs excluded,  <dig> had been treated with glucocorticoids for more than  <dig> days,  <dig> had been diagnosed with babesiosis and/or ehrlichiosis  or had visited an endemic area ,  <dig> had concurrent inflammatory disease ,  <dig> had neoplasia , and  <dig> had a concurrent immune-mediated disease . the owner of  <dig> dog decided not to start treatment.

of  <dig> dogs eligible for the ap protocol,  <dig> met exclusion criteria, leaving  <dig> dogs for inclusion in the ap protocol group, as described earlier  <cit> . of the  <dig> dogs excluded,  <dig> dogs had been diagnosed with babesiosis and/or ehrlichiosis  or had visited an endemic area ,  <dig> had concurrent lung disease,  <dig> had neoplasia ,  <dig> had hematopoietic tumors ,  <dig> had sle, and  <dig> had renal disease. three dogs were treated with medications that can trigger imha, the owner of  <dig> dog chose not to start treatment, and data were incomplete for  <dig> dogs.

to exclude concomitant disease, the  <dig> dogs in the p protocol group underwent additional investigations, namely, thoracic radiography , abdominal ultrasound , cytological investigations , pathological examination , gastroduodenoscopy , laparotomy , electrocardiography , and bacteriological investigations . for the same reason, the  <dig> dogs included in the ap protocol group also underwent additional investigations, namely, thoracic radiography , abdominal ultrasound , cytological examination , pathological examination , gastroduodenoscopy  dogs, explorative laparotomy , electrocardiography . cytology of the spleen showed that the dogs in both groups had extramedullary erythropoiesis in the spleen and liver, and that most dogs had steroid-induced hepatopathy. there was no evidence of concomitant disease in any of the dogs.

the characteristics of the ap protocol group have been described earlier  <cit> . of the  <dig> dogs that were included in the p protocol group,  <dig> dogs were crossbreeds,  <dig> were maltese terriers,  <dig> were jack russell terriers,  <dig> were labrador retrievers,  <dig> were flat coated retrievers,  <dig> were english springer spaniels,  <dig> were dachshunds,  <dig> were cairn terriers,  <dig> were shetland sheepdogs, and  <dig> were appenzeller sennen dogs, respectively; the remaining  <dig> dogs were single dogs of other breeds. twenty-seven of the  <dig> dogs were males  and  <dig> were females . in the ap protocol group,  <dig> were male  and  <dig> were female . there was no significant difference in the number of male and female dogs in the two groups , or in the number of intact and neutered male and female dogs . median body weight at the time of diagnosis was  <dig>  kg  in the p protocol group and  <dig>  kg  in the ap protocol group .

the median age at diagnosis of imha was  <dig>  years  in the p protocol group and  <dig>  years  in the ap protocol group; this difference was not statistically significant . the median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis of idiopathic imha was  <dig> days  in the p protocol group and  <dig>  in the ap protocol group; this difference was significantly significant . anemia and clinical signs consistent with a tentative diagnosis of imha were documented by the referring veterinarian in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days before the diagnosis of idiopathic imha in our clinic.

there was no significant difference in the occurrence of anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, red urine, dyspnea, fever, pale mucous membranes, icterus, or petechiae between the treatment groups. information from the history and the physical examination, and the results of laboratory investigations at the time of diagnosis of imha are presented in table  <dig>  thrombocyte counts were significantly lower in the ap protocol group than in the p protocol group at the time of diagnosis , but none of the other laboratory variables were significantly different at the time of diagnosis. the laboratory procedures for determining pt, aptt, fibrinogen, and thrombocytes changed during the study, but this led to significant differences in the results for pt and fibrinogen only. the mean pt before and after the change was  <dig>   and  <dig>   seconds , respectively, and the mean fibrinogen concentration before and after the change was  <dig>   and  <dig>   mg/l , respectively. only the pt and fibrinogen data for p protocol patients that entered the study before the change in laboratory procedures are included in table  <dig> and were used in the univariate analysis. there were no significant differences in pt and fibrinogen levels between the two groups.

therapy
blood transfusions were given to  <dig> of  <dig>  dogs in the p protocol group  and in  <dig> of  <dig>  dogs in the ap protocol group . the difference in transfusion requirement between the two groups was not statistically significant . the median duration of prednisolone therapy was  <dig> days  in the p protocol group and  <dig> days  in the ap protocol group; the difference in treatment duration was not statistically significant . in the ap protocol group, the median duration of azathioprine therapy was  <dig> days .

outcome
dogs in the p protocol group made the first return visit to the clinic after a median of  <dig> days  and the second return visit after a median of  <dig> days . dogs in the ap protocol group made the first return visit to the clinic after a median of  <dig> days  and the second return visit after a median of  <dig> days . the first and second return visits were significantly earlier in the p protocol group than in the ap protocol group . apart from a significantly higher reticulocyte count in the p protocol group at the first return visit , there were no significant differences in hematocrit, thrombocytes, and red cell osmotic fragility between the two groups at either visit . eight dogs in the p protocol group relapsed after a median of  <dig> days , as did  <dig> dogs in the ap protocol group after a median of  <dig> days . there was no significant difference in the time to relapse  or in the number of relapses  between the two groups.

discussion
the aim of this study was to determine whether treatment according to a protocol including azathioprine and prednisolone  compared with a protocol including prednisolone  alone leads to differences in outcome and survival in dogs with idiopathic imha. there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in the duration of immunosuppressive therapy, number of blood transfusions, survival , or treatment response.

thrombocyte counts at the time of diagnosis were significantly lower in the ap protocol group than in the p protocol group. although a low thrombocyte count has a negative influence, mainly on short-term survival  <cit> , it is unlikely that the lower thrombocyte count in the ap protocol group masked a potential beneficial effect of azathioprine for a number of reasons. firstly, the most likely explanation for the low thrombocyte count in dogs with imha is the decrease over time due to both immune-mediated destruction and thrombotic tendencies  <cit> . the median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis of idiopathic imha was the longest in the ap protocol group, which might explain the lower thrombocyte count in this group. studies of imha show survival curves with similar slopes, with most deaths occurring in the first  <dig> weeks after diagnosis, despite differences in severity of clinical disease  <cit> . this suggests that recovery from the acute imha crisis and the associated pathology, such as thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, takes about  <dig> weeks. indeed, at the first return visit thrombocyte counts were no longer different between the two groups . we have previously found that thrombocytopenia at the start of therapy decreases short-term survival but not long-term survival  <cit> . on the basis of this, it is unlikely that the difference in thrombocyte count at the time of diagnosis had an effect on long-term outcome. secondly, it is debatable whether azathioprine has a clinical effect within  <dig> weeks of therapy initiation in dogs. although azathioprine decreased the lymphocyte blastogenic response in dogs after  <dig> days of treatment  <cit> , it induced significant changes in immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte numbers only after  <dig> weeks of treatment  <cit> . thirdly, the best multivariate cox proportional hazards model  contained urea plasma concentration, icterus, and spherocytes as significant predictors of death due to imha. neither inclusion of the variable "treatment protocol" nor "thrombocytes" improved this model significantly. for these reasons, we conclude that the difference in thrombocyte count between the two protocol groups at the start of the study is not likely to have had an influence on long-term survival.

one of the drawbacks of using historical controls is that time-related differences in the study population or in the treatment received, other than the effect of azathioprine, might confound the effect of treatment. because inclusion criteria were unchanged throughout the trial and based on the results of objective quantitative laboratory tests, it is unlikely that this led to unrecognized inclusion bias. to minimize exclusion bias based on time-related differences in the diagnostic work-up, at the time of the study each individual case was evaluated by one of the authors to ensure that causes of secondary imha had been appropriately excluded. although the addition of azathioprine was the only identifiable difference in treatment between the two groups, it cannot be excluded that supportive care in the intensive care unit had improved during the trial. in our institute, contrary to what is advocated by others  <cit> , it is not routine practice to use antithrombotics or anticoagulants that might otherwise have influenced outcome.

although there were no treatment-related differences in treatment response and survival, there were some differences between the laboratory results at the time of first and second return visit. the reticulocyte count in the p protocol group was significantly higher, which, although modest, might indicate that the red cell regeneration response was still active, because the first return visit in the p protocol group was  <dig> days earlier than that of the ap protocol group. alternatively, it might reflect azathioprine-induced bone marrow suppression in the ap protocol group  <cit> . azathioprine related side effects were noted in  <dig> of  <dig>  dogs in the ap protocol group  <cit> . this seems a less likely explanation, however, since hematocrit, leukocyte, and thrombocyte counts at the time of first return visit were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. eighteen dogs in our study developed idiopathic imha before the  <dig> year of age, in contrast with previous reports describing an onset only after the first year of age  <cit> . the clinical and laboratory findings and survival of these  <dig> dogs were not significantly different from those of the other  <dig> dogs in this study .

azathioprine is listed as a human carcinogen  <cit> , and for this reason its use should be restricted in veterinary medicine to indications for which an evidence-based effect has been demonstrated, or to studies seeking to prove its beneficial effect  <cit> . while there was no significant difference in 1-year survival between the two groups, the confidence interval included both a 20% superior survival and a 11% lower survival. given the limitations that are inherent to a retrospective study, this potential difference in outcome might be regarded as clinically significant. a randomized placebo-controlled study is necessary to estimate the true effect size of the ap protocol for the treatment of canine imha. the estimated effect size in this study can be used for sample size calculations  <cit> . however, given the side effects in dogs and the carcinogenicity in humans, we feel that the findings of this study do not justify the use of azathioprine in each imha patient. given that at least 95% of the dogs in both protocol groups were classified as improved or completely recovered at the first control visit a median of  <dig> days after the start of therapy , we suggest that the addition of azathioprine to the prednisolone protocol should be considered if there is no, or an inadequate, response to prednisolone after 2- <dig> weeks of treatment, provided the guidelines for adjustment of the prednisolone treatment have been followed.

CONCLUSIONS
the absence of a statistically significant difference in survival indicates that there may be no beneficial effect of including azathioprine in the standard treatment of all cases of imha; however a blinded, randomized clinical trial is needed to establish the true difference in effect between the two treatment protocols.
