BACKGROUND
all organisms use genetic information during dna replication, transcription and translation. this process is known as the central dogma, where the decoding of genetic information during gene transcription and protein synthesis is mediated by rna. in addition, proteins levels are controlled, in part, by those of rna. thus, the control of rna abundance is crucially important. many studies have investigated sigma factors and transcriptional regulators, which are involved in rna synthesis. however, rna levels are controlled by rna degradation, as well as rna synthesis. thus, studies of rna degradation are also necessary to understand rna levels. ribonucleases  are the main enzymes in rna degradation and maturation pathways, and they have been widely studied. however, the overall degradation network of rnases and the substrates of this degradation have not been fully elucidated at the whole cell. this is partly because rnases are considerably smaller in number than substrate rnas. in humans, it is believed that there are approximately  <dig>  total genes  <cit> , of which fewer than  <dig> are rnase genes. thus, a single rnase must degrade hundreds or thousands of rnas and must therefore have broad substrate specificity. it is necessary to determine these substrate specificities and to develop a comprehensive view of the rna degradation system in the whole cell.

the contribution of each rnase to rna degradation has not been fully delineated, even for well-known rnases, particularly in terms of the functional interrelationships between these enzymes. some studies have investigated the global control of rna turnover, but these studies were focused on endo-rnases, which are believed to degrade mrna  <cit> . many substrates have been identified for each exo-rnase  <cit> , but no endogenous substrates have been assignment of to these enzymes based on global substrate profiling. in addition, rnases that were considered not to be involved in mrna decay were excluded from these investigations. moreover, recent advances in genome analysis have led to the identification of several rnases of functionally unknown. for example, the β-casp family proteins were identified as 5′–3′ exo-rnases  <cit>  although their physiological function is unknown.

the extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus hb <dig> is a gram-negative eubacterium, which can grow at temperatures over 75°c  <cit> . we selected t. thermophilus hb <dig> as a model organism for the present study for several reasons:  it has a smaller genome size than other model organisms;  each biological system in t. thermophilus is comprises of only essential enzymes,  t. thermophilus hb <dig> is one of the most widely analyzed organisms in terms of structural analysis. in addition, the regulation of rna synthesis in t. thermophilus hb <dig> was studied by shinkai et al.,  <cit> ; therefore, we hoped to gain insight into the relationship between rna synthesis and degradation. according to the blast research,  <dig> putative rnases have been identified in t. thermophilus hb <dig> genome . rnase y is a key component of the rna degradosome of bacillus subtilis along with rnase j1/j <dig>  pnpase and several other enzymes  <cit> . rnase j <dig> is a dual-function rnase, which possesses both 5′–3′ exo-rnase and endo-rnase activity  <cit> . indeed, rnase j <dig> was the first example of 5′–3′ exo-rnase in bacteria  <cit> . pnpase and rnase r degrade rna fragments generated by endo-rnases. t. thermophilus lacks rnase e, which is an essential endo-rnase in escherichia coli, whereas it possesses rnase y and rnase j, suggesting that its rna degradation pathways are similar to those of b. subtilis . rnase y and rnase j cleave mrna endonuclotically and produce rna fragments that are degraded exonucleotically by pnpase and rnase r. finally, nanornase degrades small rna fragments  <cit> . in addition to these proven rnases, t. thermophilus hb <dig> has several putative rnases, such as argonaute and l-psp.

in this study, transcriptome analyses were performed with dna microarrays to obtain information about potential rna substrates of rnases. our analysis showed that mrna abundance was affected by disruption of known rnases, as well as by putative rnases that were not previously considered to be involved in mrna decay. the effects of disruption of several rnases were influenced by the growth phase and the types of genes affected were different among three 3′–5′ exo-rnases, which have similar activity. in addition, the disruption of certain rnases caused similar changes in mrna abundance. these results suggest the existence of cooperative and functional overlaps among the rnases in t. thermophilus.

RESULTS
putative rnases in the t. thermophilus hb <dig> genome
to identify rnase genes in t. thermophilus hb <dig>  we analyzed the genome sequence based on sequence similarity and we also searched the literature. as a result, we identified  <dig> putative rnases genes . blast searches showed that ttha <dig>  ttha <dig>  ttha <dig>  ttha <dig>  ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> shared a high level of sequence similarity with rnase j, rnase y, pnpase, rnase hii , rnase hi  and rnase p, respectively. ttha <dig> is an ortholog of ttc <dig>  which was shown to be rnase j  <cit> . ttha <dig> is an ortholog of rnase hi, which degrades dna/rna hybrids. ttha <dig> is an ortholog of rnase hii, which is known to cleave rna-dna junctions only at the 5’ side of the junction  <cit> . rnase ii and rnase r share the same basic structural organization: a central catalytic rnb domain, two n-terminal cold shock domains and one c- terminal s <dig> domain. the homology scores allowed us to annotate ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> as rnase ii and rnase r, respectively. t. thermophilus hb <dig> argonaute, an rnase component of the rna-induced silencing complex in eukaryotes, was assigned as tthb <dig> because the ortholog of t. thermophilus hb <dig> , with only two substitutions, was shown to be argonaute  <cit> . previously, we showed that ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> degrade rna  <cit> . ttha <dig> specifically degrades short oligo rnas , and is therefore referred to as a nanornase  <cit> . ttha <dig> belongs to the β-casp family of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily, of which rnase j is also a member. the tertiary structures of these proteins are similar except for the c-terminal domain  <cit> .

in addition to these known rnases, we predicted that several further rnase candidates. ttha <dig> possesses a phoh-like motif, which is predicted to comprise an atpase domain and an nyn ribonuclease domain  <cit> . in addition, the n-terminal sequence of ttha <dig> appears to have a kh motif, which is a well-known rna-binding motif. therefore, we predicted that ttha <dig> is a putative rnase. the e. coli ortholog of ttha <dig>  ybey, may be involved with rrna maturation based on mutagenic studies and its strong genetic interactions with pnpase and rnase r  <cit> . furthermore, there is tertiary structural similarity between ybey and the mid domain of argonaute  <cit> . thus, we predicted that ttha <dig> is a candidate rnase. ttha <dig> belongs to the endo-rnase l-psp family. the name of this family originates from rat liver perchloric acid-soluble protein, which exhibits rnase activity  <cit> . ttha <dig> has a pin domain motif, which is known to be an rnase domain  <cit> . thus, we predicted that ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> are candidate rnases.

it should be noted that some toxin components of the toxin–antitoxin system have rnase activities  <cit> . the genome of t. thermophilus hb <dig> contains more than  <dig> pairs of genes that code for toxin–antitoxin components, some of which contain a pin domain motif. in addition, some crispr-associated  proteins are known to possess rnase activities  <cit> . a cas protein from t. thermophilus hb <dig>  cse <dig>  has already been reported  <cit> . however, we excluded putative rnases in the toxin-antitoxin system and crispr-mediated immune system from this study on the basis that these rnases do not degrade mrnas under normal growth conditions.

disruption of rnase genes
to uncover the functions of t. thermophilus rnases in vivo, we successfully disrupted  <dig> of the  <dig> putative t. thermophilus hb <dig> rnase genes. gene disruption was performed by homologous recombination using a thermostable kanamycin-resistant marker. despite repeated attempts, no kanamycin-resistant colonies were obtained after disrupting rnase j, rnase p or nanornase. these results suggest that each of these three genes is essential for the growth of t. thermophilus hb <dig> under the conditions used in this study. it is perhaps to be expected that the protein component of rnase p is essential for cell viability because this enzyme catalyzes 5’-end maturation of trna species, which is a vital process during the production of mature trnas. the protein subunit of rnase p is essential for the cleavage of trna precursors in normal growth conditions  <cit> , and it is an essential gene in b. subtilis <cit> . thus, disruption of the ttha <dig> gene, which encodes the protein component of rnase p, may result in the deletion of rnase p. the gene that encodes rnase j has been reported to be essential in b. subtilis and streptococcus pyogenes <cit> . however, it should be noted that a sinorhizobium meliloti disruptant of the single rnase j gene was viable  <cit> . nanornase is believed to be a functional homologue of e. coli oligoribonuclease , which is essential for cell viability  <cit> . however, we previously reported the disruption of the nanornase gene, ttha <dig>  <cit> . this might be due to the polyploid nature of t. thermophilus hb <dig> genome . except for rnase r, deletions of the other  <dig> rnase genes did not affect the cellular growth rate.

dna microarray analysis of rnase disruptants
to identify the role of each rnase in the regulation of global mrna abundance, we performed transcriptome analyses of the rnase disruptants using dna microarrays. we grew cultures in rich medium and analyzed wild-type and disruptant cells at the log  and stationary phases.

the overall mrna levels of each disruptant were analyzed at the orf level and compared with those of the wild-type cells. the genes were screened based on a false discovery rate  and a fold change  relative to the wild type. these results are shown in additional file  <dig> 

no significant changes in the mrna levels were detected in the disruptants of l-psp , pin-domain family protein  or rnase ii . ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> are postulated to be rnases based on their sequence motifs. thus, we may anticipate that the disruption of either of these two genes would have little effect on global mrna abundance. however, given that e. coli rnase ii is known to actively degrade transcripts  <cit> , it was surprising that disruption of the rnase ii gene had no significant effect on global mrna abundance in t. thermophilus hb <dig>  it should be noted that we did not detect small changes below the significant threshold. in addition, we have conducted a proteome analysis and have detected the presence of rnase ii and ttha <dig> in t. thermophilus hb <dig> cells grown in the same growth conditions as used here . these findings also indicate that the rnase r gene was expressed as a protein in wild-type cells under the test conditions used here.

the numbers of orfs with a q value < <dig>  and a fold change of >2-fold relative to the wild type are indicated in the table.

significant changes in mrna abundance were detected in 7/ <dig> rnase disruptants . this analysis showed that the abundance of  <dig> mrnas were affected under all the examined conditions for each strain based on our experimental criterion. of these,  <dig> were significantly increased in abundance, whereas  <dig> were significantly reduced in abundance. the increase or decreases in the levels of the remaining  <dig> mrnas depended on the growth phase and the specific disruptants. these results suggest that the disruption of rnases affected global mrna abundance directly by degrading transcripts and via indirect processes. in addition, these data suggest that different rnases act on different substrates and during different growth phases.

roles of rnase y, rnase r, and pnpase in regulating global mrna abundance
the gene disruptions of rnase y, rnase r and pnpase, which are known to be involved in mrna decay  <cit> , resulted in increases and decreases in the abundance of annotated transcripts, but the profiles varied depending on the growth phase. disruption of the rnase y gene affected mrna levels only in the log phase, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively . these numbers contrasted dramatically with those obtained in the b. subtilis rnase y-depleted strain, where approximately  <dig>  transcripts were affected  <cit> . the most highly up-regulated gene was uridylate kinase , whereas the most highly down-regulated was tthb <dig>  a hypothetical protein . among the genes that exhibited altered mrna levels,  <dig> encoded a transporter or a permease. in addition,  <dig> genes were related to amino acid transport and metabolism. these results suggest that rnase y is not the major endo-rnase in t. thermophilus, unlike rnase y in b. subtilis.

the effects of rnase r and pnpase gene disruption were more evident during the stationary phase than the log phase. in particular, three and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated during the log phase, respectively . this result appeared to be consistent with a report that e. coli rnase r affects gene expression during the stationary phase  <cit> . the genes of the rnase p protein component  and trna methylthiolating enzyme  were up-regulated in the rnase r gene disruptant. these two proteins are involved in the trna maturation process  <cit> . the ttha <dig> gene was also up-regulated during the stationary phase, whereas the smpb transcript was down-regulated. smpb promotes rnase r proteolysis by stimulating the binding of lon and hsluv proteases  <cit> . the loss of rnase r may result in reduced smpb expression. during the stationary phase,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively . among the affected genes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were categorized into the cogs codes e, g, i and j, respectively. in the translation category , the genes of five ribosomal proteins, two aminoacyl-trna synthetases, and an initiation factor if- <dig> were up-regulated. in the lipid metabolism category , the transcripts of two acetyl-coa acetyltransferases and two acyl-coa dehydrogenases were down-regulated. some of these genes are known to be regulated by fadr, which is a tetr-family transcriptional repressor  <cit> . another tetr-family repressor, paar, was up-regulated, although fadr was not, but these repressors have different target specificities  <cit> . it is noteworthy that many of the sulfur oxidation  genes, i.e., ttha <dig>  to ttha <dig> , exhibited a drastic reduction in their mrna levels . these genes are believed to be involved in oxidative sulfur metabolism  <cit> . ttha <dig>  a putative sulfurtransferase, had the most reduced mrna level  among the rnase r gene disruptant. this effect may be related to the involvement of rnase r in protecting t. thermophilus hb <dig> cells against oxidative stress. three genes  were common to the gene lists of the log and stationary phase cells.

the disruption of the pnpase gene  resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> genes with up- and down-regulated mrna levels during the log phase, respectively . during the stationary phase,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively . the mrna levels of  <dig> genes, most of which encode a hypothetical protein, were affected during the log and stationary phase. among the affected genes in the stationary phase,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were categorized into cogs codes e, h, and j, respectively. in the coenzyme metabolism category , genes that encode proteins involved in thiamin biosynthesis, i.e., ttha <dig>  to ttha <dig> , were strongly down-regulated . similarly, six ribosomal proteins and two elongation factors  were down-regulated only during the stationary phase. this contrasted with the results for the rnase r gene disruptant, which led to the up-regulation of translation-related proteins during the stationary phase . however, it should be noted that the affected genes were different in the two disruptants.

given that rnase r and pnpase are both 3′–5′ exo-rnases, we considered that it would be informative to compare the genes affected by the disruption of these enzymes. only nine and  <dig> genes were affected in both strains during the log and stationary phases, respectively . the direction of the change of expression for each specific gene was the same in both strains, where both up- and down-regulation were observed. during the log phase, nine common genes were affected, which corresponded to approximately 20% of the genes affected by pnpase gene disruption. during the stationary phase,  <dig> common genes were affected, which corresponded to approximately 13% of the genes affected by pnpase gene disruption. the common genes affected in the rnase r and pnpase gene disruptants varied depending on the growth status of the cells. these results suggest that rnase r and pnpase have different substrate selectivity and that endo-rnases act mainly during the log phase, whereas exo-rnase act mainly during the stationary phase.

roles of rnase h family proteins in regulating global mrna abundance
gene disruption of the rnase h family of proteins, rnase hi, rnase hii and argonaute, led to changes in the mrna abundance levels of many genes. this result provided the first experimental evidence that rnase h family proteins are involved in the control of gene transcript levels. the disruption of the rnase hi gene affected global mrna transcript levels independent of the growth phase, whereas a significant effect of rnase hii gene disruption was observed only during the log phase. in log and stationary phases, rnase hi gene disruption caused the numbers of down-regulated genes  to be higher than those of up-regulated genes  . in total, the expression levels of  <dig> common genes  were identified as affected during both the log and stationary phases. ttha <dig> and ttha <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein, were up-regulated dramatically  during both the growth phases. tthb <dig> to tthb <dig> were also up-regulated significantly, particularly during the stationary phase . tthb <dig> is a tetr-family transcriptional repressor  and is likely to negatively regulate the tthb018–tthb <dig> operon  <cit> . however, the up-regulation of tthb <dig> did not correlate with the down-regulation of this operon. this observation suggests action of another regulatory mechanism. the genes ttha <dig> to ttha <dig> were down-regulated. in particular, ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> were dramatically down-regulated  during both growth phases. ttha <dig> is a novel cyclic di-gmp-degrading protein which comprised a response regulator-domain and a hd-gyp domain  <cit> . down-regulation was also observed for ttha <dig> , which encodes a ggdef-domain protein that is associated with cyclic di-gmp synthetase activity. in addition, most of the genes from ttha <dig> to ttha <dig> were down-regulated by greater than 10-fold after disruption of the rnase hi gene.

disruption of the rnase hii gene led to the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively, during the log phase . the number of down-regulated genes was almost three times the number of up-regulated genes. among the affected genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were categorized into cogs codes e, c, and p, respectively. of these, ttha <dig>  a proline dehydrogenase, was the most highly up-regulated gene , with concomitant up-regulation of ttha <dig> and ttha <dig>  both of which encode enzymes involved in proline and arginine metabolism . the ttha <dig> gene was the most highly down-regulated gene  in both the rnase hii and rnase hi gene disruptants. in addition, the  <dig> genes localized on the megaplasmid ptt <dig> were affected by the disruption of the rnase hii gene and most  were down-regulated. this number corresponds to 31% of the genes encoded on ptt <dig> 

argonaute gene disruption led to up- and down-regulation of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, during the log phase . during the stationary phase, the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes increased to  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . ttha <dig> and ttha <dig> were up-regulated dramatically  during both growth phases. during the stationary phase, the genes from tthb <dig> to tthb <dig> were significantly up-regulated . furthermore, the crispr genes  were down-regulated during both phases. up-regulation of the genes tthb <dig> to tthb <dig> was also observed in the rnase hi gene disruptant, as described above. similarly, ttha <dig> , ttha <dig> , ttha <dig> , and most of the genes from ttha <dig> to ttha <dig>  were significantly down-regulated by the disruption of the argonaute gene, as was the case with the rnase hi gene disruptant. these results suggest some similarity between rnase hi and argonaute gene disruptants, particularly during the stationary phase. furthermore, the region from ttha <dig> to ttha <dig> was markedly down-regulated in the argonaute and rnase hi gene disruptants. it should be noted that the mrna level of rnase r was increased  by disruption of the argonaute gene.

some genes were commonly affected in the rnase hi, hii and argonaute gene disruptants. thus, we compared the changes in mrna levels among these three rnase h family protein disruptants. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> common genes were up- and down-regulated during the log phase, respectively . in particular, most of the affected genes in the argonaute disruptant were also up- or down-regulated in the rnase hi and/or hii gene disruptants. during the stationary phase,  <dig> and  <dig> common genes were up- and down-regulated in the rnase hi and argonaute gene disruptants, respectively . only  <dig> of the genes affected during the stationary phase exhibited changes in expression in all three disruptants during the log phase, most of which  were down-regulated. these results suggest that rnase h family proteins, including argonaute, are involved in regulating the mrna abundance of specific genes. this gene list included three proteins, i.e., tthb <dig> , tthb <dig>  and tthb <dig> , and two proteins where the mrna level increased during phage infection  <cit> . in the list of genes affected during the log and stationary phases,  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, were associated with the crispr loci of the megaplasmid and were down-regulated. these results suggest that the rnase h family of proteins is involved in the expression of the crispr defense system.

roles of putative rnases in the regulation of global mrna levels
the disruption of the ttha <dig>  ybey, and phoh-like genes, which are putative rnases, affected many mrnas . among these, we have already reported the rnase activity of ttha <dig>  <cit> . in the ttha <dig> gene disruptant,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. during the stationary phase, fewer genes were affected  and 40% of genes were similarly influenced during both phases. the total number of genes affected by the disruption of ttha <dig> was greater than that caused by the disruption of the rnase r or pnpase genes. this suggests that ttha <dig> is involved with the global mrna decay system. in the ttha <dig> gene disruptant, more genes were affected during the log phase than the stationary phase, which contrasts with results obtained with the other disruptants. moreover, the affected genes were classified into many categories, including cogs codes e, j, c, and p.

for the ybey gene disruptant cells during the log and stationary phases, the numbers of up-regulated genes  were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, whereas the numbers of down-regulated genes  were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes during both the growth phases were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which corresponded to approximately half of the genes affected during the log phase. in total,  <dig> genes were affected by the disruption of ybey, which suggests the involvement of this putative rnase in global mrna abundance.

the disruption of the phoh-like gene, which encodes a putative rnase, resulted in significant changes in mrna abundance during the stationary phase where  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively . among the  <dig> genes that were up-regulated by more than 3-fold in the phoh-like gene disruptant, seven were also up-regulated  in the ybey gene disruptant. similarly, nine genes with more than 3-fold decreased expression were found in both disruptants. the mrna level of the ybey gene was down-regulated in the phoh-like gene disruptant and vice versa. the phoh-like gene  is located immediately upstream of the ybey gene  in the t. thermophilus genome. the disruption of the ybey gene had similar effects to that of the phoh-like gene. during the log phase, no significant changes were detected in the phoh-like gene disruptant.

comparison of the mrna abundance changes in the ybey and phoh-like gene disruptants showed that  <dig> common genes were affected, which corresponded to approximately 64% of the genes affected by the disruption of the ybey gene. during the log phase, the genes affected by disruption of ybey and ttha <dig> were roughly clustered . indeed,  <dig> of these genes were common and corresponded to approximately 62% of the genes affected by ybey gene disruption. these results suggest that ttha <dig>  ybey and phoh-like proteins act as functional rnases in t. thermophilus hb <dig> 

tree clustering analysis
the changes in the mrna abundance of some disruptants appeared to be similar, so we performed hierarchical tree clustering analysis using spearman’s correlation coefficient to group the mrnas with similar expression profiles . in this analysis, we used the benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate  instead of the q value, and we did not use a 2-fold threshold. therefore, all of the disruptants from both growth phases were included in this analysis. figure  <dig> shows that the disruptants of some rnases gene had similar patterns of affected genes, which were clustered together. during the log phase, the patterns of affected genes in the argonaute, rnase hi, and hii gene disruptants were similar and clustered , whereas during the stationary phase that of the rnase hii disruptant was not clustered with those of the argonaute and rnase hi disruptants . these similarities are also indicated in the results shown in figure  <dig>  similarly, the genes with changed mrna levels during the stationary phase after the disruption of ybey and phoh-like genes were roughly clustered . the rnase r gene transcript level was increased in the argonaute disruptant, but the disruption of these two genes produced different mrna abundance patterns according to the tree clustering analysis.

discussion
despite repeated attempts, we were unable to isolate disruptants for the genes that encode rnase j, rnase p, and the nanornase, tttha <dig>  b. subtilis has two β-casp family proteins, rnase j <dig> and j2; rnase j <dig> is known to be essential  <cit>  but rnase j <dig> is not  <cit> . rnase j <dig> is involved in rrna maturation  <cit>  and its disruption may affect ribosome assembly. t. thermophilus hb <dig> also has two β-casp family proteins, rnase j and ttha <dig>  rnase j in t. thermophilus hb <dig> may also be related to rrna maturation, which would make it an essential gene; however, ttha <dig> is not essential and is not an ortholog of rnase j <dig>  but belongs to a different subfamily from rnase j <dig> and j <dig>  in the present study, disruption of the ttha <dig> gene affected  <dig> genes during the log phase and  <dig> genes during the stationary phase. this suggests that ttha <dig> plays an important role in regulating global mrna levels. ttha <dig> has a 5′–3′ exo-rnase activity and probably has an endo-rnase activity  <cit> . however, disruption of the rnase j <dig> gene in b. subtilis affected the expression of only  <dig> genes  <cit> .

rnase p is known to be involved in trna maturation. in the absence of the protein component of rnase p, the turnover of rnase p is low because of the slow release of degradation products in low salt conditions  <cit> . thus, knockout of the rnase p protein component  may disrupt trna maturation by affecting rapid product release, thereby generating a lethal phenotype. the gene that encodes the protein component of rnase p is also essential in b. subtilis and e. coli <cit> .

the recj-like protein ttha <dig> specifically degrades nanornas with 5’–3’polarity  <cit> . thus, ttha <dig> is a nanornase and is believed to be a functional homolog of e. coli oligoribonuclease . in e. coli, orn is an essential protein for cell viability, although the reason for this is unclear. goldman et al. proposed that the toxic effects of nanornas are caused by altered gene expression because of nanorna-mediated priming  <cit> . it should be noted that we successfully disrupted ttha <dig> in a previous study  <cit> . recently, it was reported that t. thermophilus is a polyploid organism, which harbors multiple genome copies per cell  <cit> . therefore, we may not have disrupted all copies of ttha <dig> in our previous study.

the disruptants of three putative rnases gene exhibited no significant changes in mrna abundance in this study. among these, rnase ii is known to be the main mrna degradation exo-rnase in e. coli <cit> . this enzyme degrades rna fragments with 3′–5′ polarity generated by endo-rnases, such as rnase e and rnase g. however, disruption of the rnase ii gene in t. thermophilus did not affect mrna abundance. in contrast, disruption of the pnpase and rnase r genes, other 3′–5′ exo-rnases, led to changes in the mrna levels of many genes in t. thermophilus. these results suggest that rnase ii is not a major exo-rnase in t. thermophilus hb <dig>  it is possible that the same rnases have different roles in different species.

the disruptants of two putative rnase genes, the l-psp and pin-domain protein genes, had no significant effect on mrna abundance. the rat ortholog l-psp is known to be an inhibitor of in vitro transformation  <cit>  and it also has an rnase activity  <cit> . another recent study reported that a l-psp homolog bound glucose  <cit> . thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that ttha <dig>  is not an rnase.

ttha <dig> has a pin-domain, which is known to have rnase activity, and a tram domain, which is predicted to bind rna. in this study, disruption of the ttha <dig> gene had no significant effects on global mrna levels. thus, it is possible that ttha <dig> is not an rnase that degrades endogenous mrna.

disruption of the putative rnases genes, ybey, phoh-like, and ttha <dig>  caused significant changes in mrna abundance. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first transcriptome analysis of phoh-like and ttha <dig> orthologs. as discussed earlier, disruption of ttha <dig> caused significant changes in mrna levels, which suggests that this protein functions as an rnase in vivo. in the ybey gene disruptant, the expression levels of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were affected during the log phase and stationary phase, respectively. the structure of ybey is similar to that of the mid domain of argonaute, which is a 5′-phosphate-binding domain  <cit> . moreover, ybey is related to rrna maturation  <cit> . therefore, the effect of ybey gene disruption on global mrna abundance may be attributable to the loss of its rnase activity. alternatively, ybey may affect mrna levels by interaction with other protein that have rnase activity. the mid domain is also believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the ybey-phoh-like gene cluster is conserved in most bacteria, including t. thermophilus, and an interaction between these two proteins was suggested by a previous large-scale analysis  <cit> . in addition, ybey has strong genetic interactions with rnase r and pnpase  <cit> . therefore, the effects of ybey gene disruption on mrna abundance may be caused by interactions with these rnases. it should be noted that the phoh-like gene disruptant exhibited no significant changes in the mrna profile during the log phase, unlike the ybey gene disruptant. this may indicate that the assumed interaction depends on the growth phase.

in the phoh-like gene disruptant, the mrna levels of  <dig> genes was affected during the stationary phase. originally, phoh-like protein was identified as a phosphate starvation-inducible protein, which was subsequently reported to bind atp  <cit> . a recent sequence analysis suggested that phoh-like protein resembles the nyn domain, which shares a common protein fold with the nuclease superfamily of proteins  <cit> . thus, it is possible that phoh-like protein binds rna.

a significant change in mrna abundance was detected after disruption of the rnase hi and hii genes. this was a slightly unexpected finding because these rnases are believed to function during dna replication and repair. the rnase h family proteins are dna/rna hybrid-specific rnases, which degrade the rna primers of okazaki fragments during the dna replication process. we were able to isolate disruptants of rnase h family genes, indicating that they are not essential genes for cell viability. thus, the lack of one rnase h family protein may be compensated for by another. recently, it was reported that rnase hii is involved with the repair of ribonucleotide misincorporation in dna  <cit> .

t. thermophilus rnase hii is a rna–dna junction-specific rnase  <cit> . in particular, this enzyme can only degrade dna–rna–dna/dna hybrids, and it is believed to generate a nick to eliminate misincorporated nucleoside monophosphate  from dna  <cit> . it is possible that disruption of the rnase hii gene induced dna instability by the misincorporation of ribonucleotides into dna.

a significant change in mrna abundance was detected after disruption of the argonaute gene, which was similar to that seen after disruption of the rnase hi and rnase hii genes . the structure of the piwi domain of argonaute is similar to that of the rnase h domain  <cit> . this observation suggests that argonaute may have a similar activity to rnase h family proteins. moreover, it is known that argonaute can degrade dna/rna hybrid substrates  <cit> . thus, argonaute may be a functional homolog of rnase h. furthermore, the region from ttha <dig> to ttha <dig> was down-regulated, which suggests that argonaute and rnase hi are related to the control of this region. genes of the crispr system, a bacterial immunosystem, were down-regulated in the argonaute gene disruptant. argonaute may be involved with the immunosystem by regulating the crispr system  <cit> .

finally, the disruption of well-known rnase genes had significant effects on mrna abundance. rnase y is believed to be an endo-rnase, which functions during the initial phase of mrna decay in b. subtilis <cit> . rnase y forms the rna degradosome with rnase j, pnpase and other components  <cit> . this rnase is essential in b. subtilis, but the rnase y gene could be disrupted in t. thermophilus. in addition, although the mrna levels of  <dig>  genes was affected by rnase y gene knockdown in b. subtilis, only  <dig> genes were affected by rnase y gene disruption in t. thermophilus. this difference suggests that rnase y is less important in t. thermophilus than in b. subtilis. in a model of mrna decay pathways, the endo-rnase activity of rnase y in b. subtilis is believed to take the place of rnase e in e. coli. if this endo-rnase activity is essential for mrna decay, it is possible that there is an alternative to rnase y in t. thermophilus. intriguingly, no significant changes in mrna levels were detected during the stationary phase. this may be attributable to the lower expression level of the rnase y gene during the stationary phase in the wild-type cells  or the relatively low contribution of rnase y to mrna decay initiation during the stationary phase.

the effects of rnase r and pnpase gene disruption were more evident during the stationary phase than the log phase. rnase r and pnpase are 3′–5′ exo-rnase and cold-inducible rnases in e. coli <cit> . in particular, rnase r is known to be a stress-inducible rnase  <cit> . this may explain why the disruption of these rnases gene had a greater effect on mrna abundance during the stationary phase, compared with the log phase. furthermore, the level of the rnase r mrna was increased slightly  during the stationary phase in t. thermophilus and there was an increased level of pnpase mrna during the stationary phase compared to the log phase.

another point is that pnpase can polymerize the poly  tail of the transcript. in bacteria, mrna is known to be destabilized by the poly  tail  <cit> . thus, polymerization of the poly  tail by pnpase could affect the mrna stability. thus, the effect of pnpase gene disruption on mrna levels may have been caused by a deficiency of poly  polymerization.

the results of this study suggest that bacterial argonaute has similar functions to the rnase h family proteins, particularly rnase hi. it is possible that these rnases degrade their substrate rnas to the same extent. another possibility is that argonaute cooperates with rnase h family proteins. indeed, rnase hi could not fully complement argonaute gene disruption, and vice versa. furthermore, argonaute, the slicer nuclease, is known to be the central component of the eukaryotic rnai system  <cit> . t. thermophilus argonaute is known to exhibit a site-specific dna-guided endoribonuclease activity in vitro <cit> . it is hypothesized that t. thermophilus argonaute destroys virus or plasmid transcripts directly via its endoribonuclease activity. however, the natural target rna and the source of the guide dna molecule for this argonaute remains to be determined and there is no experimental evidence of its physiological function. thus, the present study may provide some insights into the function of argonaute in t. thermophilus.

in some disruptants, the number of genes affected depended on the growth phase. it is possible to suppose that the expression levels of rnase genes change according to growth phase; however no significant changes were detected in the rnase gene mrna levels through growth phase in wild-type strain . thus, it is believed that the phase dependence of gene expression was attributable to changes in the abundance of other mrnas rather than to the functions of rnases. therefore, the relative activity was changed by increasing or decreasing the levels of mrnas.

the changes of mrna abundance observed in this study could be caused by indirect  effects, for example, disturbed mrna degradation of transcriptional factors could increase or decrease mrnas which transcription is regulated by those factors. to investigate this possibility we need to compare the patterns of the transcripts between wild-type and disruptants of transcriptional factors. furthermore,

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we provided novel experimental evidence for rnase function . our study suggests that ttha <dig> and argonaute are involved in regulating global mrna levels. this is especially important for bacterial argonaute, which was previously a protein with unknown function. in addition, our study also suggests that rnase hi and rnase hii have similar function in gene regulation. ybey and phoh-like proteins are suggested to act cooperatively as functional rnase. unexpectedly, rnase y and rnase ii disruption had less impact on mrna abundance in t. thermophilus than in b. subtilis and e. coli. moreover, disruption of the rnase y gene affected mrna abundance only at the log phase, whereas disruption of rnase r and pnpase genes only had an effect in the stationary phase. these results suggest that the roles of the well-known rnases on global mrna levels vary in different species and during different growth phases. finally, this study suggest that t. thermophilus hb <dig> has  <dig> functional rnases.
