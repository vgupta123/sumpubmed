BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic proteins  were first identified nearly  <dig> years ago as components of a protein extract derived from bone that could direct cartilage and bone formation  <cit> . the bmps have since been shown to play roles in multiple other developmental pathways  <cit> . for example, bmp <dig> provides positional information during axis formation and limb patterning  <cit> . it is expressed in interdigital mesenchyme where apoptosis is occurring, and it induces apoptosis in human myeloma cells  <cit> . in contrast, bmp <dig> prevents apoptosis in a chondrocytic cell line and in breast cancer cells  <cit> . in the embryonic lethal bmp <dig> null mouse, amnion/chorion development is compromised and the heart is malformed  <cit> . bmp <dig> is required for neural crest cell migration, and it promotes neuronal differentiation in neural crest derivatives  <cit> . bmp <dig> is also required for embryonic vasculogenesis and promotes tumor angiogenesis  <cit> .

bmps are members of the transforming growth factor β  superfamily. the bmp subfamily, which includes over twenty members, constitutes the largest subfamily in the tgfβ superfamily  <cit> . in addition to bmps, the subfamily includes mammalian growth and differentiation factors , decapentaplegic, 60a and screw in drosophila, and daf- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . like other members of the tgfβ superfamily, bmps are synthesized as preproproteins and translation is directed to the rough endoplasmic reticulum  by n-terminal signal peptides. while in the secretory pathway, a bmp proprotein is cleaved on the c-terminal side of the proprotein convertase recognition sequence, -r-x-x-r-, to release the c-terminal peptide  <cit> . the c-terminal peptide homodimerizes by disulfide bonding to form the mature secreted growth factor  <cit> . once secreted from the cell, the active bmp dimers signal by binding to heterotetrameric serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes that transduce signals to the nucleus via smad proteins as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> .

the bmps have previously been recognized only as secreted growth factors. we present evidence herein, however, for the existence of nuclear variants of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf5/cdmp <dig>  we have detected the nuclear variant of bmp <dig>  in a variety of different cell types, and we demonstrate that nuclear localization of nbmp <dig> is directed by a bipartite nls that overlaps the site of proteolytic cleavage. nbmp <dig> is translated from an alternative start codon that is located downstream of the er signal peptide. without the signal peptide, translation occurs in the cytoplasm and the proprotein avoids the secretory pathway and the proprotein convertases located therein. the bipartite nls is therefore left intact and directs localization to the nucleus. examination of other bmp family members revealed that the proteins bmp <dig> and gdf5/cdmp <dig> are also detectable in the nuclei of cultured cells. like bmp <dig>  both contain nlss that overlap the sites of proprotein processing, and both produce nuclear variants from downstream alternative start codons. the existence of nuclear variants of at least three different bmp family members suggests the conservation of a functional role for these proteins in the nucleus, representing a novel mechanism of bmp function.

RESULTS
immunostaining reveals nuclear bmp2
using dna affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry, we recently observed fragments of the bmp <dig> proprotein in nuclear extracts from rat chondrosarcoma  cells. suspecting cytoplasmic contamination, we performed immunofluorescent staining of three cell lines: 10t1/ <dig> mesenchymal cells, balb/3t <dig> fibroblasts, and rcs cells, using primary antibodies against bmp <dig> . cells were imaged using an olympus ix <dig> laser confocal microscope to allow imaging of cellular cross-sections in order to distinguish staining that was at or immediately outside of the nuclear envelope from staining that was truly nuclear. all three cell lines showed true nuclear localization of bmp <dig> . antibody specificity was confirmed using side-by-side comparison of balb/3t <dig> cells stained with antibody that was or was not pre-absorbed with recombinant human bmp- <dig>  . pre-absorption inhibited antibody staining, including nuclear staining, confirming that the antibody used is specific for bmp <dig> 

identification of the nuclear localization signal
the psort ii program http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ was used to predict potential nuclear localization signals  in the rat bmp <dig> proprotein amino acid sequence. three candidate nlss were identified. the first, pelgrkk , is positioned at amino acids 26- <dig>  almost immediately following the signal peptide. the second, plhkrek , is located at amino acids 272- <dig>  at the c-terminus of the propeptide. the third, krekrqakhkqrkrlks , is a bipartite nuclear localization signal situated at amino acids 275- <dig>  which overlaps both nlsb and the site of proteolytic cleavage .

to determine whether these potential nlss were capable of directing nuclear localization, we fused each one to the c-terminal end of green fluorescent protein . the fusion constructs were transiently transfected into rcs cells, and cells were stained with the dna-specific stain to-pro- <dig> iodide to highlight nuclei. transfected cells were examined using an olympus ix <dig> laser confocal microscope. neither nlsa nor nlsb produced nuclear localization of gfp . rather, gfp  fused to the short nlss was distributed throughout both the cytoplasm and the nucleus as would be expected for a protein that is small enough  to diffuse through nuclear pores  <cit> .

because the two short putative nlss bracket the free propeptide that would be released upon proteolytic cleavage of the bmp <dig> proprotein, we investigated whether the two nlss might cooperate to transport the free propeptide to the nucleus. we built a construct in which the n-terminal putative nlsa was fused to the n-terminus of gfp and the c-terminal putative nlsb was fused to the c-terminus of gfp. transient transfection of this construct into rcs cells revealed that even together, the two short nlss failed to produce nuclear localization of gfp .

finally, we fused the putative bipartite nlsc, also containing nlsb , to the c-terminus of gfp. transient transfection of this expression plasmid into rcs cells produced clear nuclear localization of gfp, indicating that the predicted bipartite nlsc is indeed functional . comparison of rat bmp <dig> with the amino acid sequences of mouse, human, chicken, and frog bmp <dig> showed that the critical basic amino acids in the bipartite nls are 100% conserved between these species .

to determine whether the bipartite nls was functional in the context of full-length bmp <dig>  we built a fusion construct designed to express the entire bmp <dig> proprotein, including the signal peptide, with gfp fused to its c-terminus. this wtbmp2/gfp plasmid was transiently transfected into rcs cells, and results were analyzed by cell counting using laser confocal microscopy. of the cells expressing gfp,  <dig> ± 3% showed nuclear localization of the wtbmp2/gfp fusion protein . the remainder of the gfp-expressing cells showed bmp2/gfp either evenly distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, or predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. a control plasmid expressing only gfp produced diffuse gfp localization in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of all transfected cells as previously observed by others  <cit> , verifying that the bmp <dig> portion of the fusion protein is required for nuclear localization .

to confirm that the bipartite nls was necessary for nuclear localization of bmp <dig>  a targeted mutation of five amino acids within the bipartite nls in the bmp2/gfp fusion construct  was generated . when transfected into rcs cells, this construct produced 0% nuclear localization of bmp2/gfp, confirming that the bipartite nls that overlaps the site of proteolytic cleavage was essential for nuclear localization , and that no other sequence elements could compensate for the loss of the bipartite signal . this result implied that the nuclear version of bmp <dig> is uncleaved, as cleavage would split and thus destroy the bipartite nls.

the nuclear localization of the wtbmp2/gfp fusion protein and the necessity of the nls was further confirmed and quantified by transfecting wtbmp2/gfp and nlsmtbmp2/gfp plasmids into 10t1/ <dig> and balb3t <dig> cells, staining with dapi, and analyzing gfp localization using an imagestream® multispectral quantitative imaging flow cytometer. the imagestream® sorted for cells that expressed gfp and then imaged each of these cells individually. representative images of cells with non-nuclear and nuclear localization of the gfp fusion protein are shown in figure 3a. an untransfected cell is also shown .

the percent of gfp-expressing cells in each sample that displayed nuclear localization of the gfp fusion proteins was assessed by measuring the 'similarity' of the gfp and dapi images on a per cell basis. the similarity score is a log-transformed pearson's correlation coefficient of the pixel values of the dapi and gfp images  <cit> . if gfp is localized to the nucleus, the two images are similar and have large positive values. similarity gfp/dapi overlay histograms for wtbmp2/gfp  and nlsmtbmp2/gfp  in each cell line are shown . the percentage of cells with nuclear gfp was defined by gating the events with high similarity scores at the points indicated by the horizontal black line in the upper right of each histogram. balb/3t <dig> and 10t1/ <dig> cells showed  <dig> % and  <dig> % nuclear localization of the wtbmp2/gfp fusion protein, respectively. mutation of the nls reduced nuclear localization to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, demonstrating once more that the bipartite nls directs nuclear localization of bmp <dig> .

preventing proprotein cleavage does not increase levels of nbmp2
we examined the possibility that uncleaved nuclear bmp <dig> could be produced by inhibition of the proprotein convertase responsible for its cleavage. the cleavage site of bmp <dig>  r-e-k-r-↓, is a consensus site for furin as well as for several related members of the proprotein convertase family, and furin cleaves bmp <dig>  the bmp family member most closely related to bmp <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether furin can cleave bmp <dig>  we used an in vitro protein cleavage assay. this showed that furin can cleave bmp <dig>  and that cleavage can be prevented by α1-pdx, a serine protease inhibitor  that is highly selective in its inhibition of furin   <cit> .

to examine whether the production of nuclear bmp <dig> can be increased in vivo by inhibiting proteolytic processing of the bmp <dig> proprotein by furin, we utilized the α1-pdx expression plasmid α1-portland . cotransfection of this plasmid with the wtbmp2/gfp fusion plasmid into rcs cells did not produce a statistically significant increase in the percentage of transfected cells showing nuclear localization . likewise, cotransfection of the bmp2/gfp fusion plasmid with a furin expression plasmid did not decrease the percentage of transfected cells showing nuclear localization  .

because it is possible that another proprotein convertase besides furin is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of bmp <dig>  we constructed a cleavage mutant of bmp2/gfp with a disrupted consensus cleavage site but with the essential amino acids in the bipartite nls intact, designated mtbmp2/gfp . this mutant cannot be proteolytically processed by any member of the proprotein convertase family, because it lacks the essential arginine in the fourth position of the minimal proprotein convertase recognition sequence  leaving the nls always intact  <cit> . this mutation, however, also failed to alter the percentage of transfected cells showing nuclear localization , suggesting that regulation of the proprotein convertase involved in proteolytic processing of bmp <dig> is probably not the mechanism by which the uncleaved nuclear variant of bmp <dig> is produced .

nbmp <dig> translation is initiated from a downstream alternative start codon
we also considered the possibility that uncleaved bmp <dig> could be produced by initiating translation at a downstream alternative start codon, which would eliminate the signal peptide. such a protein would not be directed to the er and the secretory pathway, and would thus avoid proteolytic processing. we examined the nucleotide sequence of rat bmp <dig> mrna and found, downstream of the conventional atg initiation codon, an in-frame atg at codon  <dig> that was surrounded by a partial kozak sequence   <cit> . the netstart  <dig>  prediction program http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netstart/ indicated that codon  <dig> is the second most likely translational start site in the bmp <dig> transcript with a score of  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  for the conventional initiator codon  <dig>  the mouse, human, chicken, and frog bmp <dig> sequences were also all predicted by the netstart  <dig>  program to contain strong alternative start sites at codons  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> 

to test the hypothesis that codon  <dig> is used as an alternative start codon, bmp <dig> was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of 35s-methionine. when the radiolabeled protein products were separated by sds-page, the major expected band of  <dig> kda appeared as well as a minor band of approximately  <dig> kda, consistent with the predicted size of a protein initiated at codon  <dig> . mutation of codon  <dig> to a non-initiator aag codon eliminated the 38-kda band, indicating that this protein was indeed produced by initiating translation at codon  <dig> .

to determine whether codon  <dig> can also function as an alternative start site in vivo, we generated bmp2/gfp fusion constructs containing substitution mutations in either the conventional start codon  <dig> or in codon  <dig>  these constructs were transfected into rcs cells, and subcellular localization was visualized by fluorescent laser confocal microscopy. the wtbmp2/gfp fusion construct produced nuclear localization in  <dig> ± 3% of transfected cells. mutation of the conventional start codon to compel utilization of the downstream alternative start codon dramatically increased nuclear localization to  <dig> ± 3% of transfected cells. in contrast, mutation of the alternative start codon  <dig> reduced nuclear localization to only  <dig> ± 1%, indicating that codon  <dig> is utilized to produce the nuclear variant of bmp <dig>  in vivo .

to verify that nbmp <dig> is an uncleaved variant containing part of the propeptide and the bipartite nls, two copies of a hemaglutinin  tag were inserted into the full length bmp <dig> cdna between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> in the propeptide region .  in a second construct, a single ha tag was inserted at the c-terminus of bmp <dig>  . these expression vectors containing ha-tagged bmp <dig> were transfected into rcs cells, and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared. to verify that the nuclear extract was free from cytoplasmic contamination, the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to immunoblotting using a golgi-specific antibody  . immunoblotting with an anti-ha antibody revealed a protein of ~ <dig> kda in the nuclear extract, regardless of whether the ha tag was embedded in the propeptide or placed at the c-terminus of bmp <dig>  indicating that the nuclear variant begins at a point somewhere between the signal peptide and amino acid  <dig>  and extends to the c-terminus of the conventional secreted growth factor. the nuclear variant of bmp <dig> is clearly not cleaved in the middle of the bipartite nls .

in order to determine whether cultured cells contain an endogenous bmp <dig> protein that is localized to the nucleus and matches the molecular weight of our ectopically expressed ha-tagged bmp <dig>  nuclear extracts were prepared from untransfected rcs cells and examined by immunoblotting using an anti-bmp <dig> antibody. once again, a protein of ~ <dig> kda was detected in the nuclear extract, indicating that the translation and localization of ectopically expressed nbmp <dig> accurately reflects the translation and localization of endogenous nbmp <dig> .  in addition to supporting our proposed model for nbmp <dig> translation and localization, these immunoblotting results also confirm the figure  <dig> immunofluorescence results showing endogenous nbmp <dig> in the nuclei of untransfected cells.

the calculated molecular weight of nbmp <dig> translated from the predicted alternative start codon at amino acid  <dig> is  <dig> kda. this is consistent with the size of the bmp <dig> protein produced in vitro where post-translational modifications do not occur . bmp <dig>  however, is post-translationally modified in vivo. this causes the full-length preproprotein, which has a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda, to migrate at about  <dig> kda on sds-page  <cit> . it is probable, then, that post-translational modifications also account for the discrepancy between the calculated size of nbmp <dig>  and its observed electrophoretic mobility .

nuclear localization of nbmp <dig> varies throughout the cell cycle
the observation that only about 20% of the cells expressing wtbmp2/gfp display nuclear localization of gfp at any given moment suggested that the nuclear localization of nbmp <dig> may vary throughout the cell cycle. to address this question, we serum-starved 10t1/ <dig> cells for  <dig> hours and then returned serum to the culture medium so many cells would enter mitosis simultaneously. at various time points after serum replacement, cells were stained by immunofluorescence using primary antibodies against endogenous bmp <dig>  and imaged using an olympus ix <dig> laser confocal microscope. the four-hour time point yielded many mitotic cells, including cells in prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. cells that were not undergoing mitosis showed predominantly nuclear localization of bmp2/gfp . in contrast, cells in late prophase, when nuclear envelope breakdown occurs, showed intense bmp2/gfp staining throughout the entire cell except in the location of chromosome condensation . cells in metaphase, anaphase, and telophase also showed more intense bmp2/gfp staining than surrounding cells, but staining was excluded from the site where condensed chromosomes were located . in cells undergoing cytokinesis, when chromosomes were decondensing and nuclear membranes reforming, bmp2/gfp staining was cytoplasmic , suggesting that nuclear translocation of nbmp <dig> is necessary after each cell division to re-establish the pattern of nuclear localization observed in non-mitotic cells .

nbmp <dig> and ngdf <dig> are produced by similar mechanisms
to determine whether the existence of nuclear variants might be conserved among other bmp family members, we utilized the psort ii program http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ to search their amino acid sequences for putative nlss. two proteins, bmp <dig> and gdf <dig>  were selected for further study because each contained a predicted bipartite nls overlapping the site of proprotein processing, as in bmp <dig> . when fused to gfp, both of these predicted nlss were found capable of directing translocation of gfp to the nucleus in rcs cells . immunofluorescent staining was performed on cultured 10t1/ <dig>  balb/3t <dig>  and rcs cells to see if endogenous bmp <dig> and gdf <dig> could be detected in the nuclei. using primary antibodies against bmp <dig> , we found that nuclear bmp <dig> was detectable in all three cell lines . using primary antibodies against gdf <dig> :sc- <dig>  santa cruz biotechnology), we found that gdf <dig> was detectable in the nuclei of 10t1/ <dig> and balb/3t <dig> cells, but was not localized to the nucleus in rcs cells .

to determine whether the bipartite nlss were necessary for the nuclear localization of bmp <dig> and gdf <dig>  gfp was fused to the c-terminus of each full-length protein. when transfected into rcs cells, the wtbmp4/gfp fusion construct showed nuclear localization in  <dig> ± 6% of transfected cells  and the wtgdf5/gfp fusion construct showed nuclear localization in  <dig> ± 3% of transfected cells by manual counting on an olympus ix <dig> laser confocal microscope . targeted mutation of the bipartite nls in bmp <dig>  markedly reduced nuclear localization  . targeted mutation of the bipartite nls in gdf <dig>  completely eliminated nuclear localization  , demonstrating that the bipartite nlss overlapping the sites of proprotein processing are necessary for nuclear localization of both bmp <dig> and gdf <dig> 

because nbmp <dig> is translated from a downstream alternative start codon, bmp <dig> and gdf <dig> were examined using the netstart  <dig>  prediction program http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netstart/ to identify possible alternative start codons. bmp <dig> contained a predicted alternative start site at codon  <dig> . when the conventional start site at codon  <dig> was mutated  in the context of the bmp4/gfp fusion protein to force utilization of downstream alternative start codons , nuclear localization increased to 80% of transfected cells  . targeted mutation of codon  <dig> , in contrast, reduced nuclear localization by approximately one-half to 16%  , indicating that codon  <dig> can indeed be used as a start site for translation of the nuclear variant of bmp <dig> .

when the conventional start site at codon  <dig> in gdf <dig> was mutated  in the context of the gdf5/gfp fusion construct  to force utilization of downstream alternative start codons, nuclear localization increased to 78% of transfected cells , indicating that the nuclear variant of gdf <dig> is also translated from one or more downstream alternative start codons . mutation of a possible ctg alternative start site  at codon  <dig> did not change the percent of transfected cells showing nuclear localization of gdg5/gfp, suggesting that this site does not serve as an alternative start codon . the first in-frame atg after codon  <dig> is found at codon  <dig>  when this site was mutated , nuclear localization was reduced to 7% of transfected cells  , indicating that codon  <dig> can serve as an alternative start codon for the translation of nuclear gdf <dig> .

discussion
the results presented here demonstrate that translation that begins downstream of the er signal peptide drives nuclear localization of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf <dig>  in each case, elimination of the signal peptide prevents translation of the nascent polypeptide into the er and thereby prevents transit through the secretory pathway, which in turn prevents contact with the golgi-localized proprotein convertases that would otherwise cleave the proprotein and destroy its nls. these findings indicate that nuclear bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf <dig> proteins translated from alternative downstream start codons cannot function in their traditional role as ligands binding to cell surface receptors, because they cannot enter the secretory pathway. likewise, processed and secreted bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf <dig> would not be likely to enter the nucleus after binding to cell surface receptors and being internalized, as their nlss are destroyed by proprotein processing. this mechanism for producing nuclear variants of bmp family proteins stands in contrast to several other growth factors including egf family members, ifnγ, fgf family members, prolactin, and growth hormone  <cit> . in these examples, growth factors are secreted from the cell, bind to plasma membrane receptors, and are internalized prior to translocation of the ligand and/or its receptor to the nucleus.

the nuclear localization of growth factor variants that avoid the secretory pathway is not unprecedented. a nuclear form of parathyroid hormone-related peptide  can be generated by translation from an alternative start site downstream of the conventional initiator atg, producing a protein with a truncated signal peptide much like nbmp <dig>  nbmp <dig>  and ngdf <dig>  loss of the signal peptide enables pthrp to bypass the er and secretory pathway, and an embedded nls then interacts with importin β <dig> to direct pthrp to the nucleus  <cit> . another example of nuclear localization due to utilization of an alternative start codon is found in the basic fibroblast growth factor . in one form of this protein, nuclear localization is determined by translational initiation at an upstream alternative start site. the utilization of an upstream cug start codon produces a variant protein with an extended amino terminus containing an nls that directs nuclear localization  <cit> . in the case of fibroblast growth factor  <dig> , translation can initiate at a cug codon that is  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the first aug in the protein-coding frame. these  <dig> nucleotides code for two nls signals and a hydrophobic secretory signal, and the balance between nuclear localization and secretion of this protein variant is determined by the competing signals  <cit> . these examples demonstrated a precedent for altering the subcellular localization of proteins by initiating translation from alternative start sites, and they show that nuclear localization of growth factors can occur without prior secretion of the protein from the cell  <cit> .

the novel location of the bipartite nls in bmp <dig>  overlapping the site of proprotein processing, initially led us to consider a different mechanism of nuclear localization. we examined whether inhibition of proprotein processing might leave the nls intact and thus lead to nuclear localization of bmp <dig>  this hypothesis was considered because regulation of furin activity has been shown to affect the activity of furin substrates in other cases. for example, the pro-β-ngf protein is a neurotropin that has opposing activities depending on whether or not it is cleaved by furin. cleaved β-ngf promotes cell survival, whereas uncleaved β-ngf promotes apoptosis of neurons  <cit> . furin is also responsible for cleavage of the transmembrane receptor notch. cleavage results in the release of the notch intracellular domain, which goes to the nucleus and activates genes involved in development and differentiation  <cit> . uncleaved notch, in contrast, inhibits cell differentiation  <cit> . the experiments presented here, however, do not support a role for furin modulation in regulating the localization of bmp <dig> 

instead, this work has demonstrated that nbmp <dig>  nbmp <dig>  and ngdf <dig> are all produced by initiating translation from a location downstream of the signal peptide. in each protein, an alternative start codon was identified, the mutation of which reduced nuclear localization by approximately 50%. these codons were located at amino acid positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and gdf <dig>  respectively. interestingly, these different start sites produce nuclear variants that are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids long for nbmp <dig>  nbmp <dig>  and ngdf <dig>  respectively. the differences in the lengths of the three proproteins, therefore, are almost entirely accounted for by differences upstream of the alternative start codons, suggesting that selective pressure has played a role in maintained the lengths of the nuclear variants.

the observation that mutation of the alternative start codons reduced but did not eliminate synthesis of the nuclear variants of each protein suggests that, at least in ectopically expressed fusion constructs, other sites can serve as start codons for synthesis of the nuclear variants when the primary alternative start sites are eliminated. indeed, the netstart  <dig>  program predicted several weaker alternative start codons in each propeptide coding region. it is not clear, however, whether usage of any other alternative start codons ever occurs in vivo.

the observation that only 20-30% of cells that expressed the three wild type bmp/gfp fusion constructs showed nuclear localization of the fusion proteins suggested that translational start site selection and/or nuclear translocation might be regulated, perhaps in association with the cell cycle. indeed, immunofluorescence staining of endogenous bmp <dig> in cells undergoing mitosis demonstrated that cells entering m-phase of the cell cycle display the most intense staining, which might reflect increased utilization of the alternative start codon during the g2/m phase of the cell cycle. a similar pattern of subcellular localization throughout the cell cycle has been reported for pthrp, and it has been suggested that this pattern "supports a role for pthrp in cell division"  <cit> . dissolution of the nuclear envelope seemed to allow nbmp <dig> to spread throughout the cell, either by diffusion or active transport, and when the nuclear envelope reassembled during cytokinesis, nbmp <dig> was no longer preferentially localized to the nucleus. these observations suggest that new nuclear translocation of nbmp <dig> is required to re-establish nuclear localization every time a cell completes m-phase of the cell cycle. additional experiments will be required to determine whether the same nbmp <dig> molecules can be re-transported to the nucleus, or whether de novo protein synthesis is required after each cell division. likewise, additional experiments are needed to explore whether nbmp <dig> plays any role in cell division.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the experiments presented here have demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining that endogenous bmp <dig> is detectable in the nuclei of three different cultured cell lines. gfp fusion constructs showed that the bipartite nls overlapping the site of proteolytic cleavage is essential for nuclear localization of bmp <dig>  and that the nuclear variant of bmp <dig> is produced from a downstream alternative start codon. these results are further supported by immunoblots demonstrating the presence of endogenous nbmp <dig> in nuclear extracts and showing that the electrophoretic mobility of endogenous nbmp <dig> is the same as that of ectopically expressed, ha-tagged nbmp <dig>  nuclear localization of nbmp <dig> was shown to vary as cells progressed through the cell cycle, consistent with the observation that only about 20% of transfected cells showed nuclear localization of ectopic wtbmp2/gfp at any given time. the bmp <dig> data described here is further bolstered by the demonstration that bmp family members bmp <dig> and gdf <dig> are also detectable in the nucleus by immunocytochemistry and are synthesized and localized to the nucleus by similar means. together, these results indicate that bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  and gdf <dig> can be alternatively translated as secreted growth factors or as nuclear proteins.

conservation of nuclear variants of three different bmp family members, and conservation of the mechanism by which their nuclear localization occurs, suggests a conserved functional role for these three proteins in the nucleus. the observation that nbmp <dig> localization differs at different stages of the cell cycle also suggests a functional role for this novel protein. our earliest observation of nbmp <dig> among nuclear proteins that had been purified by dna affinity chromatography suggests that nbmp <dig> may bind dna, perhaps to regulate transcription. computational analysis, however, shows no predicted dna-binding domain in nbmp <dig>  furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays have so far failed to show direct binding of nbmp <dig> to dna. it remains possible that nbmp <dig> interacts indirectly with dna as part of a protein complex, and this possibility is currently being explored by examining the array of proteins with which nbmp <dig> interacts. we have also used targeted mutagenesis to produce a mouse in which nbmp <dig> cannot be translocated to the nucleus. analysis of this mouse's phenotype is currently underway and is just beginning to yield interesting insights into the functional role of nbmp <dig>
