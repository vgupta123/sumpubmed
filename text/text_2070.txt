BACKGROUND
red raspberry  is an economically important member of the rosaceae, cultivated mainly in europe, the former ussr, and north and south america for its high value berries that are used both as dessert fruit and in processing. rubus idaeus belongs to the sub-family rosoideae and is a highly heterozygous diploid perennial species with a base chromosome number of seven .

raspberry breeding programmes worldwide aim to produce improved cultivars to satisfy market demands which can also produce a profit for the growers. from making a controlled cross to naming a new cultivar takes between  <dig> and  <dig> years and there are many targets, including fruit quality, yield and season, as well as pest and disease resistance and plant habit. the fresh market demands perfect fruit with no pesticide residues and the number of pesticides available for horticultural crops is diminishing; so pest and disease resistance is increasingly important. the large raspberry aphid, amphorophora idaei, transmits several viruses including raspberry leaf mottle virus , raspberry leaf spot virus , black raspberry necrosis virus  and rubus yellow net virus , and vector resistance has been central to the breeding programme at east malling research  for  <dig> years. raspberry canes can grow up to  <dig> m and training and tipping canes to a manageable height is expensive. many years ago breeders at east malling tried to produce self-supporting types, which could be grown without the traditional trellis system, using cane characteristics from r. cockburnianus and r. crataegifolius and dwarfing habit from r. ideaus  <cit> . unfortunately the fruit quality and yield penalties of this approach made it uneconomic.

nearly  <dig> major gene traits have been reported in rubus idaeus  <cit>  including resistances to different biotypes of amphorophora idaei and dwarf types. several linkages have been proposed and these are summarised in the bibliography of knight et al.  <cit> . knight and keep  <cit>  highlighted the advantages of using resistance to a. idaei as a means of controlling virus infection in raspberry as early as  <dig> and elucidated the genetic control of such a resistance derived from 'baumforth a', assigning it to a single dominant gene, a <dig>  <cit> . it is clear from both papers that this resistance is strongly dependent upon the a. idaei biotype used for the screening; a <dig> was found to provide resistance against colonisation from biotypes  <dig> and  <dig> but it was not useful against the then uncommon biotype  <dig>  resistance gene a <dig> is reportedly linked to d <dig> for frilly dwarf with a recombination fraction of 3%  <cit> . the north american cultivar 'chief' was reported to be the donor of additional resistance genes  by knight et al  <cit>  with a <dig> reported to provide resistance against biotype  <dig>  this resistance could also be achieved by the combination of a <dig> with either a <dig> or a <dig>  briggs  <cit>  reported a fourth a. idaei biotype and gave more detailed information about the different aphid biotypes and explained the genetics of the aphid-host interaction. despite biotype  <dig> being very rare in the field and difficult to overwinter in culture for experimental inoculations, resistance was identified from r. idaeus subsp. strigosus  and explained by genes a <dig> and a <dig>  both also conferring resistance to biotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this resistance was later attributed to al <dig> and might be the same as a <dig> from r. occidentalis described by keep and knight  <cit> . a third gene conferring resistance to all four biotypes was subsequently identified  from a german clone of r. idaeus subsp. vulgatus  <cit> . the widespread growing of cultivars carrying a <dig> resistance has imposed a strong selection pressure on aphid populations causing biotype  <dig> to become predominant. small populations of biotype  <dig> can be found only in wild raspberries in remote locations and biotypes  <dig> and  <dig> may be extinct. in addition, an a <dig> resistance-breaking biotype has been reported  <cit> .

the pyramiding of several aphid resistance genes in breeding lines in order to provide more robust and long-lasting resistances has been an objective at emr for  <dig> years  <cit> ; however it is currently impossible to determine which and how many resistance genes are carried by resistant selections. this inability is due to not only the complex pedigrees of the plant material and the unavailability of some aphid biotypes, but, most importantly, to the equivalent effect of the genes al <dig>  a <dig> and ak4a, which makes them phenotypically indistinguishable; indeed they may be synonymous. molecular markers would be a key tool in differentiating reported genes, identifying their presence in modern hybrid material and in managing strategies for pyramiding.

jennings  <cit>  reported and depicted a dwarf phenotype which he attributed to the recessive gene dw and speculated that dw was linked with h and t, the genes for pubescent stems and for presence or absence of anthocyanin. soon afterwards, keep  <cit>  described sturdy dwarf, identical to that of jennings  <cit> , and four new dwarf phenotypes  to add to the previously reported frilly  <cit> . she ascribed digenic control to the sturdy dwarf phenotype involving gene d <dig> and d <dig> and accepted jennings's hypothesis of linkage between this character and the h and t genes.

with a view to marker-assisted breeding and map-based gene cloning, there is interest in extending linkage maps to include molecular markers. aflps  <cit>  have become a useful tool for generating maps of large numbers of dominant markers without prior knowledge of dna sequence  <cit> , although their subsequent application as markers for selection of useful traits is limited to the breeding lines in which they were generated, unless they are first converted to scars  <cit> . owing to their codominant nature and ease of transferability between germplasm, microsatellite markers , have found utility for a variety of purposes including the development of transferable, saturated linkage maps in many rosaceous genera  <cit> , and ssrs have recently been developed for rubus  <cit> .

graham et al.  <cit>  employed both ssr and aflp markers to produce a molecular linkage map of red raspberry  based on a cross between the north american cultivar 'latham' and the european cultivar 'glen moy' . the most recent version of this map  <cit>  is composed of  <dig> markers , covering  <dig> cm in eight linkage groups . the l × gm map has been used to map the major gene h which determines cane pubescence to linkage group  <dig> of the rubus genome and also to confirm the close association of that gene with resistance to cane botrytis , spur blight  and cane blight , which were first reported by knight and keep  <cit> , jennings  <cit>  and jennings  <cit> , respectively. in addition, a number of other qtl associated with disease resistance and plant morphology have been located on the l × gm map.

in this paper we report the analysis of an f <dig> population from a cross between two r. idaeus cultivars, 'malling jewel' and 'malling orion' raised as one of a series to investigate the distinctiveness of the different aphid resistance genes that have been used in the breeding programme at east malling. our aim was to map two agronomic characters, resistance to a. idaei infestation  and dwarfing habit , both of which segregate in this progeny, but have not previously been mapped in raspberry. we produced a framework map from the progeny using aflp and ssr markers which provides coverage of the seven rubus linkage groups previously defined by graham et al.  <cit>  and we successfully located the two phenotypic characters to discrete positions on two of the linkage groups defined using molecular markers.

RESULTS
phenotypic evaluation
in total,  <dig> seedlings were raised, of which  <dig> survived to be screened for resistance to a. idaei . on the  <dig> seedlings susceptible to a. idaei , well-established colonies were visible a week after inoculation. of these plants,  <dig> were normal and  <dig> were dwarfs. sixty-two seedlings had no aphids or very few individuals, not constituting a colony, and were classed as resistant . of these,  <dig> were normal and  <dig> were dwarf. five dwarf seedlings were too weak for inoculation and remained of unknown a <dig> status. segregation for dwarf habit became apparent soon after germination,  <dig> being normal and  <dig>  dwarfs; this accords with the 3: <dig> segregation ratio expected in a progeny from a cross of two heterozygotes segregating for a recessive character . the mapping progeny is made up of  <dig> dwarf and  <dig> normal seedlings susceptible to a. idaei , and  <dig> dwarf and  <dig> normal seedlings resistant to a. idaei .

molecular marker segregation
in total,  <dig> seedlings from the mapping progeny  were genotyped with molecular markers for map construction. from the  <dig> aflp primer combinations tested, a total of  <dig> segregating products were scored in the parents of the progeny. forty-five dominant markers segregated in 'm. jewel' and  <dig> dominant markers segregated in 'm. orion', whilst  <dig> markers segregated in both. of the  <dig> ssr markers tested, a total of  <dig> polymorphic segregating markers were scored in the progeny. three ssrs segregated in 'm. jewel', seven segregated in 'm. orion', and the remaining  <dig> segregated in both parents. as explained in the next section,  <dig> of the marker loci were mapped and significant deviation from the expected 1: <dig> and 3: <dig> ratios was detected at  <dig> of these. a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> molecular marker loci that segregated and the two morphological traits scored in the mapping progeny were used to construct a linkage map. the mapped markers comprised  <dig> aflp loci segregating only in 'm. jewel',  <dig> aflp loci segregating only in 'm. orion' and  <dig> aflp segregating in both parents, along with all  <dig> ssr markers.

mapping in m. jewel × m. orion 
the  <dig> molecular markers and the two phenotypic traits, resistance to a. idaei  and dwarfing habit , located to seven linkage groups , in accordance with the base chromosome number of rubus, generally at a lod of  <dig>  or above . the exceptions to this were two regions that were associated with other markers, but at a lod of just  <dig> ; lg <dig> markers be41mcaaf91-bru167a, and lg <dig> ru26a-be37mcaaf <dig>  a further  <dig> aflp loci that segregated in 'm. jewel' were associated with lg <dig> and lg5; however, they remained unlinked when markers were assigned map positions, presumably because insufficient codominant markers segregated within these groups. the remaining five aflp loci were not associated with any of the seven linkage groups revealed after linkage analysis. the a <dig> gene mapped to lg <dig>  flanked by the codominant ssr ru103a and the aflp ae40mcaan <dig>  whilst the dw gene mapped to lg <dig>  flanked by the aflp markers be40mcatn <dig> and e37mcagf <dig>  the  <dig> nt allele of the ru103a marker was in coupling with the resistance allele a <dig>  the closest ssrs to the dw gene were ru43a and ruleaf <dig> which flanked the gene at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> marker loci that were mapped in mj × mo, locating to seven discrete linkage groups . markers with segregation ratios deviating significantly from the expected ratios  are indicated with one, two or three asterisks respectively.

the map covers a total distance of  <dig> cm. the average length of the seven linkage groups was  <dig>  cm, with an average of  <dig> markers per linkage group. linkage group numbering follows that of graham et al  <cit> . linkage group  <dig> was the longest, with a total length of  <dig>  cm, whilst lg <dig> was the shortest, at  <dig>  cm. an interactive version of the mj × mo map together with a table of segregation data, chi-squared values for goodness-of-fit to the expected mendelian segregation ratios for the mapped markers and the linkage groups to which each marker is located have been placed in the genome database for rosaceae  <cit> .

discussion
the linkage map of the cross between rubus idaeus 'm. jewel' × 'm. orion'  spans  <dig> cm and is composed of ssr and aflp markers in seven linkage groups which have been numbered in accord with graham et al.  <cit> . we have used this map to identify the locations of two previously unmapped phenotypic traits in rubus, resistance to amphorophora idaei  and dwarfing habit .

genome coverage and comparison with other rubus linkage maps
the linkage map of mj × mo is significantly shorter than the  <dig> cm of the l × gm map of graham et al.  <cit> . however, through the mapping of common ssr markers in both progenies, we have been able to compare the genetic regions covered by the two maps. figure  <dig> compares the mj × mo and l × gm maps with the locations of common markers highlighted. linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the mj × mo map cover approximately the same genetic region as the l × gm map. linkage group  <dig> of mj × mo has just one mapped ssr common to the l × gm map, but covers a genetic distance of approximately the same size, whilst lg <dig> and lg <dig> are shorter than those of the l × gm map, covering  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm  respectively. thus we conclude that the mj × mo genetic linkage map covers approximately 80% of the raspberry genome, with only partial regions of lg <dig> and lg <dig> not covered. linkage group  <dig>  however, is composed almost entirely of markers segregating only in 'm. orion', with only one aflp locus segregating in both parents.

aphid resistance
the map position of the major gene determining resistance to a. idaei in 'm. orion'  was located on lg <dig> of the mj × mo map at approximately  <dig> cm from a codominant ssr marker ru103a that segregates in both parents of the mapping population. we are not proposing that ru103a be used directly for preselection for aphid resistance; for large scale selection, inoculation under glasshouse conditions remains cost-effective. however, now that an association between the a <dig> gene and a transferable codominant molecular marker has been established, we could screen progenies segregating for other aphid resistance genes with ru103a to establish if any of these are synonymous with a <dig> or linked to it.

selection pressure on the aphid has increased in the last  <dig> years as a result of the predominance of resistant cultivars. resistance-breaking biotypes of a. idaei have been recorded on 'autumn bliss' which carries a <dig> but not on 'm. leo' which carries both a <dig> and a10; this could be a consequence of gene pyramiding in the latter. in order to pyramid more resistance genes, especially those conferring resistance to biotypes  <dig> –  <dig>  we need to establish whether or not the reported resistances are allelic. if different loci are responsible for the different reported sources of resistance, we will need appropriate markers in order to establish the genetic composition  of parental lines and resistant progenies. if the different reported resistances are allelic, only two forms of resistance could be pyramided into a single variety.

interestingly, the region of lg <dig> associated with a <dig> is also the location of qtl for resistance to a number of rubus pathogens, cane botrytis, spur blight and rust, on the map of graham et al.  <cit> .

dwarfing
there is a discrepancy between the single gene control for dwarf proposed by jennings  <cit>  and the two gene system proposed by keep  <cit> . however, the 3: <dig> segregation observed in 'm. jewel' × 'm. orion' and the successful mapping of the character indicates that just one gene segregated in this progeny, consistent with the cross dwdw × dwdw according to the jennings model or d1d1d2d <dig> × d1d1d1d <dig> or vice versa according to the keep model. it should be noted however that the keep model is idiosyncratic as d1d1d2d <dig> and d1d1d2d <dig> classes are assumed to be dwarf whilst d1d1d2d <dig> are normal. why d1d1d2d <dig> should be dwarf is not explained.

in any case, if dwarf seedlings in the progeny from mj × mo have the genotype d1d1d2d <dig> then intercrossing two such seedlings should give a progeny segregating for  <dig> normal  to  <dig> dwarf and this could allow d <dig> to be mapped. as dw maps to lg <dig> and h  maps to lg <dig>  <cit>  they are unlinked, despite the speculation of jennings  <cit>  to the contrary. keep  <cit>  proposed the sturdy dwarf phenotype could have some interest for self-supporting breeding lines; however, because of other agronomic disadvantages such as reduced fertility and longevity this has not been pursued.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have produced a genetic linkage map from an f <dig> cross between two traditional red raspberry varieties using ssr and aflp markers which have provided good coverage of the rubus genome. we have mapped aphid resistance  and sturdy dwarf habit  for the first time, two single-gene traits that are of interest in raspberry breeding. for aphid resistance, we have identified a closely-linked codominant ssr marker that should be useful in discriminating aphid resistance genes from different sources and facilitate pyramiding.
