BACKGROUND
the insulin receptor substrate  family of proteins plays a key role in insulin signalling  <cit> . most, if not all, insulin signals are modulated through tyrosine phosphorylation of irs proteins  <cit> . irs proteins are intermediate cellular scaffold proteins, which act as an interface between tyrosine kinase receptors and effector proteins such as pi3k and mapk. the crucial role of irs proteins in insulin action has been demonstrated using knockout mouse models  <cit> . the distinct phenotypes of irs1-/- and irs2-/- mice present a fascinating physiological contrast, despite the significant structural similarities of these proteins  <cit> . irs1-/- mice are approximately 50% smaller in size compared to littermate controls, highlighting the importance of irs <dig> in somatic growth promotion  <cit> . irs1-/- mice are insulin resistant but also maintain normal fasting glucose and glucose tolerance due to compensatory β-cell hyperplasia  <cit> . in contrast, mice lacking irs <dig> develop type  <dig> diabetes, with irs2-/- male mice displaying both insulin resistance and β-cell failure at an early age  <cit> . in light of their pivotal role in insulin signalling, irs proteins have been examined as candidate genes for type  <dig> diabetes and other human metabolic disorders  <cit> .

animal and organ size is determined by hormones and growth factors that control processes such as cell number, cell size and cell death during fetal development and postnatal growth  <cit> . the important role of the insulin/igf- <dig> signalling pathway in growth and development is well established. ablation of insulin and igf- <dig> receptors results in early postnatal death  <cit> . irs <dig> does not regulate somatic growth to the same extent as irs <dig>  and irs2-/- mice were only 10% smaller in size compared to wild-type controls  <cit> . however, irs <dig> gene deletion precipitates a number of pathophysiological effects in organs that are typically affected by diabetic complications. in the retina, irs <dig> deletion in mice caused increased photoreceptor cell apoptosis, with decreased maturation and survival of photoreceptors  <cit> . irs2-/- mice also display reduced neuronal proliferation, leading to reduced brain size  <cit> . in the kidney, insulin is known to modify several functions of renal tubules  <cit> , with irs <dig> playing a major role in insulin stimulation of renal proximal tubular transport and pkb/akt phosphorylation in vitro  <cit> . since insulin-like, and other growth factor signalling is crucial in organ development  <cit> , we examined the effect of irs <dig> gene deletion on kidney function and development in mice. our data highlight a novel role for irs <dig> signalling in kidney size development and insulin signalling in renal cells.

RESULTS
irs <dig> is expressed in mouse kidney
levels of irs <dig> mrna were high in mouse kidney compared to mouse liver . irs <dig> protein was detected in wild-type and irs2+/- kidney, but not in irs2-/- kidney extracts . a modest 2-fold increase in irs <dig> mrna levels was detected in irs2-/- kidney, suggesting a mild compensatory increase in irs <dig> in the absence of irs <dig> .

deletion of irs <dig> causes decreased kidney size in mice
both kidney weight and kidney-to-body weight ratio were reduced in irs2-/- mice at 5- <dig> wk of age, in both male and female mice . kidney size was clearly smaller in irs2-/- mice compared to wild-type at various time-points . newborn irs2-/- mice displayed a reduction in kidney-to-body weight ratio at  <dig> d of age  which was maintained up to  <dig> d and beyond . the slopes of the growth curves indicated that irs2-/- mice had a higher rate of growth between  <dig> d and  <dig> d compared to wild-type or irs2+/- . however, the growth rate was similar between  <dig> d and  <dig> d in all three genotypes, suggesting that this higher rate of growth was not maintained in irs2-/- mice. supporting this observation, kidney size in older female mice  remained smaller in irs2-/- mice compared to wild-type , suggesting that the initial defect in kidney growth is not overcome during the lifetime of the irs2-/- mouse. no significant histological changes were seen in irs2-/- kidneys compared to wild-type at any age group, using a range of specific stains for markers of kidney damage . quantitation of glomeruli in h&e stained paraffin sections revealed that irs2-/- kidneys contained less glomeruli per kidney section than wild-type . however, when normalised for sectional area, a similar density of glomeruli  was present in irs2-/- kidneys compared to wild-type mice . together, these data suggest that irs <dig> deletion leads to a global reduction in mouse kidney size during development.

irs <dig> deletion causes increased pkb/akt signalling specifically in kidney
pkb/akt activation is a key regulator of glomerular podocyte and tubular epithelial cell survival  <cit> . the status of pkb/akt expression was therefore assessed in kidneys of wild-type, irs2+/- and irs2-/- kidneys. surprisingly, levels of total pkb/akt were elevated in both male and female irs2-/- kidneys at 5- <dig> wk of age compared to wild-type and irs2+/- . this  <dig> -3-fold increase in pkb/akt expression was also maintained in older mice . using isoform specific antibodies, marked upregulation of pkbβ/akt <dig> was identified in irs2-/- mouse kidney compared to controls . this increase was not observed in irs2-/- liver or brain , suggesting that upregulation of pkbβ/akt <dig> may be specific to irs2-/- mouse kidney. no change in the level of mrna for all three pkb/akt isoforms was detected in irs2-/- kidney compared to wild-type or irs2+/-, suggesting that either increased pkbβ/akt <dig> translation or post-transcriptional stability may account for the observed protein increase in kidney in the absence of irs <dig> 

to explore whether defects in growth factor signalling contribute to decreased kidney size in irs2-/- mice, the activation of pkb/akt in kidney in response to insulin was assessed. insulin stimulated pkb/akt phosphorylation in both wild-type and irs2-/- kidney . levels of basal pkb/akt thr <dig> and ser <dig> phosphorylation also appeared to be higher in irs2-/- kidney compared to wild-type . insulin injection triggered a higher degree of pkb/akt phosphorylation on thr <dig> in irs2-/- kidney compared to wild-type, whereas fold-change of ser <dig> phosphorylation was similar between the two genotypes . these data suggest that pkb/akt activation may be increased in the absence of irs <dig> in kidney.

the effect of increased pkbβ/akt <dig> expression on the phosphorylation of gsk3β, a major downstream target of pkb/akt was then assessed. phosphorylation of gsk3β on the inhibitory ser <dig> site increased in both wild-type and irs2-/- kidney in response to insulin . however, a number of additional bands were detected with both phospho- and total gsk3β antibodies in irs2-/- kidney extracts compared to wild-type, in both vehicle and insulin-stimulated mice . these data suggest that increased pkb/akt activation triggers hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of gsk3β in kidney. consistent with this hypothesis, levels of β-catenin, a protein targeted by gsk3β for degradation, were markedly elevated in irs2-/- kidney compared to controls . however, despite increased accumulation of β-catenin, no major changes in the expression of β-catenin targets c-myc, c-jun and cyclin d <dig> were evident in irs2-/- kidneys .

deletion of irs <dig> causes kidney-specific increases in yap expression and phosphorylation
the hippo-yap pathway has shown to be crucial in cellular processes that increase mammalian organ size  <cit> . yap is a transcriptional co-activator that is phosphorylated by kinase cascades such as hippo/mst <dig>  leading to cytoplasmic localisation and inhibition of transcription  <cit> . levels of total yap were almost undetectable in kidney extracts of adult wild-type mice, but were significantly elevated in irs2-/- kidney compared to controls . importantly, levels of yap phosphorylation on the inhibitory site ser <dig> were also increased in the absence of irs <dig> . previous data have suggested that pkb/akt may phosphorylate yap, inhibiting its function  <cit> . in our study, insulin treatment had little effect on yap phosphorylation in either wild-type and irs2-/- kidney . no changes in yap levels or phosphorylation were detected in other mouse tissues . these data suggest that deletion of irs <dig> causes increased expression of the transcriptional co-activator yap in kidney, which is immediately inactivated by phosphorylation, preventing potential yap-induced increases in kidney size.

discussion
irs <dig> is a fundamental element in normal insulin and igf- <dig> signalling, regulating glucose metabolism, brain growth, ovarian development and retinal photoreceptor apoptosis  <cit> . defects in insulin signalling may contribute to diabetic kidney disease  <cit> . our data identify a novel role for irs <dig> in renal development and in the regulation of pkb/akt/gsk3β and hippo/yap signalling in the kidney.

defects in organ growth and development have been reported due to irs <dig> gene deletion  <cit> , with irs <dig> playing a more dominant role in somatic growth compared to irs <dig>  <cit> . expression of irs <dig> can be detected in renal cortex at e <dig> , with minimal irs <dig> and irs <dig> detecetd at the same developmental time-point http://www.eurexpress.org. smaller kidneys were evident in irs2-/- mice as early as postnatal day  <dig> , and kidney-to-body weight ratio increased more rapidly between postnatal day  <dig> and  <dig> in irs2-/- mice compared to wild-type, suggestive of catch-up growth in these animals . however, this increased rate of growth was not sustained, and the kidney size defect did not recover as irs2-/- mice aged. interestingly, it has been reported that kidney and brain from irs1-/- mice exhibited proportionately smaller weight reductions than the decrease in body weight  <cit> , as opposed to larger kidney/organ-to-body weight ratio reduction observed in irs2-/- mice. these data emphasise the predominant role of irs <dig> rather that irs <dig> in determining the growth of organs such as kidney and brain.

despite decreased kidney size in irs2-/- mice, no major morphological changes or reduction in nephron density were detected, apart from slight compensatory glomerular hypertrophy. these results add to previous knockout studies which demonstrated that insulin/igf- <dig> signalling pathway is not essential for renal morphogenesis, but may be important for overall organ growth  <cit> .

the kidney-specific upregulation of pkbβ/akt <dig> in irs2-/- mice is interesting based on the overall similarity of pkb/akt isoforms, and previous data demonstrating a degree of redundancy within the pkb/akt family  <cit> . mice lacking rictor, a key element of the torc <dig> complex shown to phosphorylate pkb/akt on ser <dig>  <cit> , develop increased organ size, including kidney  <cit> . the higher basal level of ser <dig> phosphorylation seen in irs2-/- kidney suggests that higher torc <dig> activity may contribute to reduced kidney size in the absence of irs <dig>  experiments carried out by zheng and colleagues identified that deletion of irs <dig> attenuated insulin stimulated bicarbonate absorption in isolated renal proximal tubules  <cit> . of note, these authors detected a decrease in pkb/akt phosphorylation on ser <dig> with no apparent change in pkb/akt expression in kidney cortex of irs2-/- mice . the divergence between these observations and our data presented here may be explained by the fact that our study examined whole kidney lysates rather than isolated, cultured renal cortex slices. in contrast to zheng et al who examined ser <dig> phosphorylation alone, the increase in pkb/akt phosphorylation was mainly detected on thr <dig> in our experiments, and was supported by increased gsk3β phosphorylation on ser <dig> .

the specific increase in pkbβ/akt <dig> protein  suggests increased translation of pkbβ/akt <dig> mrna, or that posttranslational processes leading to pkbβ/akt <dig> degradation are absent in the irs2-/- kidney. this novel finding also suggests that this process is specific for the pkbβ/akt <dig> isoform. this increase in expression, together with increased pkb/akt phosphorlyation in the basal state may represent a compensatory mechanism resulting from the loss of irs <dig>  to enhance growth factor signalling in an effort to overcome defects in kidney growth during development. importantly, these data imply that, contrary to the predicted cellular effects, loss of irs <dig> somehow enhances, rather than inhibits pkb/akt activation in the kidney. the precise molecular consequences of irs <dig> deletion in kidney cells remain to be determined.

gsk3β is directly inactivated downstream of pkb/akt via phosphorylation on ser <dig>  <cit> . hyperphosphorylation of gsk3β was detected in irs2-/- kidney but not in liver or brain . the "laddering" of gsk3β bands reactive with the phospho-ser <dig> antibody, together with a decrease in the intensity of the gsk3β band at  <dig> kda  suggest that deletion of irs <dig> causes pkb/akt phosphorylation-dependent decreases in gsk3β activity. the accumulation of β-catenin  in the kidney of irs2-/- mice  suggests that increased phosphorylation of gsk3β leads to reduced gsk3β kinase activity in the kidney, facilitating β-catenin accumulation. this increase in β-catenin was not detected in other tissues; again suggesting that defects in pkb/akt/gsk3β/β-catenin pathway is kidney specific in irs2-/- mice. active β-catenin binds to the tcf/lef family of transcription factors  <cit>  and serves as a co-activator to stimulate the transcription of genes such as cyclin d <dig> and c-myc  <cit> , which drive cell proliferation. however, protein levels of these β-catenin targets were not significantly altered in irs2-/- kidney versus controls . thus, increased cellular β-catenin levels do not appear to be sufficient to increase protein targets in irs2-/- kidney. it remains to be determined if changes in β-catenin levels alter its transcriptional activity during a period of defective embryonic kidney growth during development. significantly, insulin-stimulated pkb/akt activation was not decreased in irs2-/- kidney at 5- <dig> wk , and no changes in basal pkb/akt/gsk3β signalling were detected in 5- <dig> wk irs2-/- liver, where profound insulin resistance was previously reported . we therefore hypothesise that signalling changes reported here occur as a direct result of irs <dig> deletion in kidney, and not as a result of insulin resistance. analysis of pkb/akt signalling at earlier time-points will help clarify these issues.

several studies have clearly established that hippo/mst <dig> pathway is critically involved in regulating organ growth  <cit> . in mammals, the mst1/lats/mob1/yap pathway plays a key role in restricting organ size by controlling both cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . the final component of this pathway, yap  <cit> , is a potent growth promoter, and overexpression of yap in the liver leads to organ enlargement  <cit> . yap is inhibited by the hippo pathway via phosphorylation on ser <dig>  leading to its cytoplasmic translocation and retention  <cit> . yap levels were markedly elevated in irs2-/- kidney compared to wild-type controls  even though levels of yap were higher in irs2-/- kidney, an increase in yap phosphorylation on ser <dig> was also evident, suggesting that immediate inactivation and nuclear export of yap may occur in irs2-/- kidney cells, preventing increased kidney growth. preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that levels of active mst <dig>  the upstream kinase responsible for yap phosphorylation on ser <dig>  are also elevated in irs2-/- kidney. consistent with these findings, protein levels of yap downstream targets, e-cadherin and survivin did not change significantly in irs2-/- kidney . therefore, similar to increased β-catenin, the accumulation of yap in adult kidney may represent a compensatory mechanism for reduced kidney size in irs2-/- mice. ultimately, this compensatory response is ineffective due to rapid ser <dig> phosphorylation and therefore inactivation of yap. thus, we hypothesise that reduced kidney size in irs2-/- may trigger changes in gsk3β and yap signalling that ultimately fail to overcome the growth defect in kidney.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have established that mice lacking irs <dig> display defects in kidney growth and pkb/akt/gsk3β signalling. it is clear that the integration of many signalling pathways is required to regulate normal organ development. irs <dig> gene deletion results in decreased kidney size and our observations suggest that specific signalling changes in the pkb/akt and yap pathway occur in irs2-/- kidney. future experiments will strive to identify the organ-specific growth control pathways that are relevant to kidney development in the irs2-/- mouse.
