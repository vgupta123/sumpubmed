BACKGROUND
it is well established that the frequency of milk removal from the mammary gland influences milk yield. specifically, increased milking frequency in dairy cattle results in greater milk production  <cit> , ranging from  <dig> to 15%  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that increased milking, when initiated during the early stages of lactation  can enhance yield throughout the entire lactation period  <cit> . furthermore, 4× daily milking for as short as the first  <dig> d in milk have resulted in persistent elevated milk yield  <cit> . the mechanisms contributing to this observed effect are unknown, but several factors have been suggested, including increased mammary epithelial cell number and differentiation  <cit> , increased mammary cell secretory capacity  <cit> , changes in apoptotic rate of mammary cells  <cit> , and increased exposure  <cit>  or sensitivity of the gland to prolactin  <cit> . studies using half udder designs have indicated that enhanced milk production in glands milked 4× daily versus unilateral or contralateral glands milked 2× daily in early lactation is regulated locally within the gland, rather than by peripheral factors  <cit> .

another potential mechanism by which increased milking frequency may result in persistent enhancement of milk yield is through increased nutrient and lactogenic hormone delivery to the mammary gland via enhanced angiogenesis. wall and mcfadden  <cit>  suggested that this mechanism is unlikely based on the acute decline in milk production they observed in response to a reduction from 4× to 2× daily milking, rather than a moderate decline one would expect with a change in vascularity. however, despite the initial decline in milk yield after cessation of 4× milking, the sustenance of increased milk yield into late lactation is consistent with a potential change in vascularity. clearly, further study is needed to identify changes that occur within the mammary gland in response to increased milking frequency during early lactation that may contribute to increased milk yield and the persistence of such an increase.

high-throughput gene transcript profiling technologies, such as serial analysis of gene expression  and microarray hybridization, are powerful approaches to evaluate global gene expression in tissues or cells of interest in response to experimental treatments or changes in physiological state. this information can provide insight into mechanisms contributing to observed physiological responses. for instance, the commercially available affymetrix bovine genome array has recently been applied to reproductive studies in cattle, including characterization of changes in gene expression that may be related to embryonic development  <cit> , female fertility  <cit> , and sperm development  <cit> . likewise, sage has been used in multiple immunological studies of cattle to identify genes related to parasite resistance  <cit> , antigen presentation in lymphocytes  <cit> , and response to bovine viral diarrhea virus infection  <cit> .

in the present study, sage and the affymetrix bovine genome array were used to characterize changes in expression of genes in the bovine mammary gland that may contribute to the increased milk production observed in response to an increase in milking frequency from 2× to 4× per day. both approaches were used to get a more thorough assessment of differential gene expression and to evaluate the utility of sage to detect gene expression changes in the lactating mammary gland. our results indicate that increased milking frequency alters expression of genes in the mammary gland related to increased extracellular matrix  remodeling, neovascularization, metabolism, cell proliferation and apoptosis. factors identified by this work support our hypothesis that 4× daily milking increases the proportion of proliferating endothelial cells within the mammary gland and provide a basis for future studies to investigate specific mediators of enhanced milk production induced by increased milking frequency. the use of sage for transcript profiling in lactating mammary gland was deemed feasible; however, the high abundance of milk proteins, such as casein and β-lactoglobulin, make this approach less efficient due to the number of sage tags that are sequenced representing these proteins.

methods
animals and sample collection
the experimental design and sample collection are described in detail in hale et al.  <cit> . briefly, multiparous holstein cows were milked either 2× daily  or 2× daily from d  <dig> to  <dig> of lactation then 4× daily beginning at d  <dig> of lactation until d  <dig> post partum . the milking intervals were approximately  <dig> h for control cows and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h, respectively, for imf <dig> cows. milk somatic cell count  was measured weekly from two consecutive milkings using an infrared analyzer  during the first  <dig> wks of lactation. mammary biopsies were obtained from a subset of cows at approximately d  <dig> and d  <dig> of lactation, processed and stored appropriately for subsequent analyses including rna extraction and assessment of cell proliferation and apoptosis by immunohistochemical procedures. no biopsied mammary glands exhibited clinical signs of mastitis. use of animals was approved by the beltsville agricultural research center's animal care and use committee.

to examine immediate changes in gene expression within the mammary gland in response to increased milking frequency, total rna was isolated from d  <dig> mammary biopsy samples  using the rneasy midi kit . the imf <dig> samples were selected for transcript profiling because significant changes in apoptotic percentage were observed in mammary epithelial cells of imf <dig> cows at d  <dig> relative to controls by hale et al. . although additional animals were used in the study, sample sizes were limited to those of sufficient tissue quantity for rna extraction. to remove contaminating genomic dna, on-column dnase digestion was performed using the rnase-free dnase set  according to kit instructions. rna quality was assessed using the bioanalyzer  <dig>  and concentrations were determined using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer .

sage library synthesis and analysis
total rna was pooled from equal quantities of control rna samples  and imf <dig> rna samples  for sage library synthesis. each sage library was constructed using the i-sage long kit  according to manufacturer's instructions. plasmid clones from each library were purified using the perfectprep plasmid  <dig> vac direct bind kit  and sequencing was conducted using an abi  <dig> automated dna sequencer and bigdye  chemistry . abundance of sage tags and differential expression was determined using sage <dig> version  <dig>  analysis software , with a normalization value of  <dig> for "compare" analysis. a minimum tag count of  <dig> in at least one of the two libraries was the minimum requirement for inclusion in the list of differentially expressed genes. tags exhibiting < <dig> -fold change in expression between treatment groups were also excluded from the list of differentially expressed genes. identity of sage tag sequences was determined using the ncbi sagemap database  <cit> .

microarray hybridization and data analysis
microarray data were collected at expression analysis, inc.  using the genechip bovine genome array . these arrays contain probes for approximately  <dig>  transcripts and variants, including over  <dig>  unigene clusters. the design of the array was based on content from bovine unigene build  <dig>  and genbank mrnas.

target was prepared and hybridized according to the "affymetrix technical manual." specifically, total rna  was converted to cdna using reverse transcriptase  and a modified oligo <dig> primer that contained t <dig> promoter sequences . after first strand synthesis, residual rna was degraded by addition of rnaseh, and a double-stranded cdna molecule was generated using dna polymerase i and dna ligase. the cdna was then purified and concentrated using a phenol:chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. the cdna products were incubated with t <dig> rna polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides using the genechip ivt labeling kit . the resultant crna product was purified using an rneasy column  and quantified with a spectrophotometer. the crna target  was incubated at 94°c for  <dig> min in fragmentation buffer . the fragmented crna was diluted in hybridization buffer  containing biotin-labeled oligob <dig> and eukaryotic hybridization controls . the hybridization cocktail was denatured at 99°c for  <dig> min, incubated at 45°c for  <dig> min, and then injected into a genechip cartridge. the genechip array was incubated at 42°c for at least  <dig> h in a rotating oven at  <dig> rpm. genechips were washed with a series of nonstringent  and stringent  solutions containing variable amounts of mes, tween <dig> and sspe. the microarrays were then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and the fluorescent signal was amplified by subsequently binding an anti-streptavidin antibody and streptavidin-phycoerythrin-labeled, biotinylated antibody. fluorescent images were detected in a genechip scanner  <dig> and expression data was extracted using the genechip operating system v  <dig>  .

an estimate of signal for each transcript was calculated using the position-dependent nearest-neighbor method  <cit>  with a compression adjustment, and the results were analyzed via principal components analysis . based on the pca results, one of the imf <dig> samples was identified as an outlier and removed prior to comparing the groups. raw fold-change for each transcript was calculated by taking the simple ratio of the geometric means of the signal values for each respective group. differential expression was determined using a robust implementation of permutation testing described on the expression analysis, inc. website  <cit> . in brief, a modified t-statistic  was calculated for each transcript when comparing groups, and a difference  was computed between di and the average or expected t-statistic ordered values from a reference distribution  calculated by computing all possible random permutations of our samples. a list of differentially expressed transcripts was then created by first selecting any transcript with a suitable difference associated with a small false discovery rate , and further narrowed by selecting for transcripts with an estimated absolute raw fold change ≥ <dig> . identity of transcripts was based on annotation by affymetrix, inc.  <cit>  and by comparison of the target bovine unigene sequence to the march  <dig> bovine genome sequence assembly  <cit>  using blat analysis. gene functions were determined primarily using the ncbi entrez gene database  <cit> , the milano annotation tool  <cit>  and the gene ontology database  <cit> .

validation of differential gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr
a subset of  <dig> genes  identified as differentially expressed by microarray analysis and  <dig> genes  differentially expressed as determined by sage were confirmed by absolute quantitative real-time pcr using the icycler iq real-time pcr detection system . genes were selected to represent a broad range of differential expression levels as determined by fold change. primer sequences for each gene target are presented in table  <dig>  reverse transcription reactions to validate the  <dig> microarray-identified genes were conducted using the abi high-capacity cdna archive kit  according to kit instructions using  <dig> μg of total rna in a 60-μl reaction volume. reaction conditions were 25°c for  <dig> min, followed by 37°c for  <dig> h. for the  <dig> sage-identified genes, reverse transcription was conducted using the iscript cdna synthesis kit  according to kit directions, using  <dig> ng of total rna in a 30-ul reaction volume. reaction conditions were  <dig> min at 25°c,  <dig> min at 42°c, and  <dig> min at 85°c. negative control reactions were also performed on each rna sample where reverse transcriptase was replaced with water in the reaction. subsequent pcr was performed in duplicate  using  <dig> μl of first-strand cdna,  <dig> pmol of each primer and  <dig>  ul of iq sybr green supermix  in a 25-μl reaction volume, based on manufacturer's instructions. cycling conditions consisted of 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, annealing temperature for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> sec, followed by a melting curve analysis. annealing temperatures used were  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for the  <dig> microarray-identified genes and  <dig> sage-identified genes, respectively. standards  comprised of gel-purified pcr amplicons of each gene target were analyzed in duplicate for each assay, and a blank reaction using water as template was included with each standard curve. the icycler software was used to calculate amplification efficiency of each assay and transcript abundance of each unknown sample was extrapolated from corresponding assay standard curves. transcript abundance was normalized to the quantity of input rna in the reverse transcription reaction. pearson correlation of fold-changes between the control or imf <dig> groups as determined by microarray and sage versus qpcr approaches for each gene was used to validate microarray results. because fold change could not be calculated for gchfr between the imf <dig> and control sage libraries due to the absence of tags for this gene in the control library , a value of 9-fold was assigned for correlation analysis.

immunohistochemistry
to validate whether increased milking frequency enhanced neovascularization in the mammary gland as suggested by our microarray results, mammary biopsy samples collected at d  <dig> and  <dig> of lactation from the  <dig> controls and  <dig> imf <dig> cows were evaluated for immunostaining of endothelial cells, using von willebrand factor  as a biomarker. in addition, mammary biopsies from  <dig> cows that were milked 4× daily beginning at d  <dig> of lactation  were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. biopsies were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4°c and transferred to 70% ethanol. samples were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin according to standard techniques and sectioned at  <dig> μm onto superfrost™ plus slides . slides were immunostained for simultaneous visualization of vwf and ki <dig> antigens by brightfield microscopy, using the picture™ plus double staining kit . antigen retrieval involved a 15-min incubation with trypsin  as described by robinson et al.  <cit>  and microwave antigen retrieval in citrate buffer  <cit> . endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 10-min incubation in 3% h2o <dig> in pbs and non-specific binding was blocked by incubating sections in cas block  for  <dig> min at room temperature. the primary antibody  was diluted 1: <dig> into a prediluted ki <dig> primary antibody . slides were incubated with both primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for  <dig> h at room temperature. negative controls were performed using a non-immune rabbit and mouse igg at appropriate concentrations. slides were then co-incubated with goat anti-mouse igg-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a goat anti-rabbit igg-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as the secondary antibodies for  <dig> min at room temperature. secondary antibodies were visualized by staining with  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine  for  <dig> min followed by fast red for  <dig> min. sections were counter stained with meyer's hematoxylin, washed, and mounted with prolong gold anti-fade reagent . co-localization of vwf and ki <dig> was indicative of a proliferating endothelial cell.

abundance of endothelial cells in mammary sections was estimated by analyzing captured images of  <dig> randomly selected fields from four biopsy specimens per slide for each animal using an olympus bx- <dig> microscope  fitted with an olympus dp- <dig> digital camera. images were analyzed using the image-pro plus image analysis software  through a standardized protocol previously described by elsasser et al.  <cit> . pixel counts for vwf were limited to only secretory epithelium and intralobular connective tissue  in each field. pixel counts were constrained using the pre-filter and 8-connect object options. counts were then normalized to the number of nuclei  pixels, and normalized counts averaged by animal at a given biopsy period. means were compared between treatments at each biopsy period using a t-test.

to quantify proliferating endothelial cells, tissue sections that were dually stained for vwf and ki <dig> nuclear proliferation antigen were manually quantified. figure  <dig> illustrates representative images showing immunohistochemical detection of proliferating mammary endothelial cells. tissue sections were viewed at a magnification of 400× and non-overlapping fields were evaluated without knowledge of animal or treatment identification. the number of endothelial cells and endothelial cells that were ki67-positive were recorded for mammary intralobular regions, whereas vessels in interlobular connective tissue were not evaluated. a minimum of  <dig> endothelial cells  were evaluated per cow at each of the two biopsy time points . presumed endothelial cells that were vwf-negative were not evaluated. the mean percentage of dually labeled cells was compared between treatment groups at each biopsy period using a t-test.

RESULTS
milk yield, mammary epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis
a detailed description of the effects of increased milking frequency on milk yield, mammary cell proliferation, apoptosis, and other measures is described in hale et al.  <cit> . briefly, the imf <dig> cows  produced  <dig>  kg/d more milk that the control cows  during the first  <dig> wks of lactation and  <dig>  kg/d more milk during the complete 44-wk lactation . mammary cell proliferation on d  <dig> and d  <dig> as determined by 3h-thymidine incorporation was not different  between the control and imf <dig> groups ; however, immunohistochemical localization of ki <dig> measured at d  <dig> was numerically greater in mammary epithelial cells of imf <dig> cows compared to control cows. in addition, the percentage of apoptotic mammary epithelial cells in imf <dig> cows was greater than the percentage in control cows  sampled on d  <dig> of lactation. similarly, the percentage of apoptotic stromal cells was greater than control cows on d  <dig> of lactation . milk components including fat and lactose percentage during the first  <dig> wks of lactation were also lower in imf <dig> cows compared to controls .

differential gene expression determined by sage
a total of  <dig>  tags were sequenced from the two sage libraries . table  <dig> lists the differentially expressed sage tag sequences, their putative annotations and putative functions. excluding the unique or unknown tags, all but three genes identified as differentially expressed by sage were represented on the microarray. as expected, the most abundant tags in both libraries were comprised of α-s1-casein , β-casein , β-lactoglobulin , κ-casein , α-s2-casein , α-lactalbumin  and glycam  <dig> . sixteen tag sequences were identified as up regulated in the imf <dig> library, including  <dig> tags matching unigene clusters,  <dig> tags matching no unigene clusters but sampled from other bovine sage libraries , and  <dig> tags unique to our library . four tag sequences were present in the imf <dig> library but absent in the control library. a total of  <dig> tag sequences were identified as down regulated in the imf <dig> library relative to the control library, including  <dig> matching unigene clusters, five unknowns, and one unique tag. two of the tags matching unigene clusters were unannotated genes. ten of the down-regulated tags were absent in the imf <dig> library but present in the control library.

 <dig> cows were milked twice daily from d  <dig> to  <dig> of lactation, and four times daily beginning at d  <dig> of lactation until d  <dig> post partum

 <dig> tag sequence is unique to this sage library

 <dig> tag sequence matches no unigene clusters but has been sampled from other bovine sage libraries

consistent with an increase in milk yield, approximately half of the annotated tags that were up regulated in the imf <dig> library represented genes functioning in protein biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation. one gene, gtp cyclohydrolase i feedback regulator  functions in the down regulation of endothelial cell nitric oxide synthesis and plays a role in immune response and vasoconstriction. likewise, transcripts for the immune-related protein lactotransferrin were up regulated in the imf <dig> group.

genes that were down regulated by increased milking frequency included those functioning in defense against microbial infection or immune response , remodeling of the mammary gland, regulators of angiogenesis, or as constituents of the ecm. in addition, tuberous sclerosis  <dig> , an enhancer of tgf-β signaling  <cit>  and inhibitor of cell proliferation and differentiation was down regulated in imf <dig> cows, as well as the tumor suppressor capg. multiple sage tags representing the classical major histocompatibility complex  class i antigen  gene locus were sampled, of which one tag was identified as up regulated and the other was identified as down regulated by increased milking frequency. likewise, this gene locus was represented on the microarray by multiple probes, which were both up and down regulated in the imf <dig> cows. three genes  identified as down regulated in the imf <dig> library were also identified as down regulated by microarray analysis. however, rps <dig> was identified as up regulated in the imf <dig> library by sage, but down regulated in imf <dig> cows by microarray analysis. in addition, expression of α-lactalbumin, a key regulatory enzyme for lactose synthesis was lower in imf <dig> cows than in control cows, consistent with the lower percentage of lactose measured in imf <dig> cows during this period.

differential gene expression determined by microarray
a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed by microarray analysis, including  <dig> unknown transcripts . compared to control cows,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> were down regulated in imf <dig> cows. two genes  were identified as both up and down regulated by microarray, depending on the probe analyzed.

eighteen differentially expressed genes were represented by multiple probes on the microarray. for these genes, the direction of fold change was consistent among all probes, with the exception of bla-dqb and bola . expression of multiple members of several gene families were also identified as responsive to increased milking frequency including: the cide family of cell death activators , collagens , fibrinogens , heat shock proteins , microfibril-associated proteins , ras and ras-like proteins , ribosomal proteins , s <dig> calcium binding proteins , serine proteinase inhibitors , secreted frizzled-related proteins , solute carriers , thrombospondins , tenascins , and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases .

as shown in figure  <dig>  the majority of genes influenced by milking frequency whose functions have been investigated included: genes controlling cell proliferation and growth or differentiation ; components of the ecm or functioning in cell adhesion ; genes involved in metabolism or nutrient transport ; and genes participating in immune response .

 <dig>  changes in regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation
a total of  <dig> genes were identified that regulate progression through cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, chromatin remodeling, or are known tumor suppressors or oncogenes. for instance, expression of the putative tumor suppressors banp, dab <dig>  diras <dig>  fat <dig>  hrasls <dig>  lox, pdgfrl and rassf <dig> and the putative oncogene bcas <dig> was altered by increased milking frequency. known growth factors and regulators of cell cycle progression were also differentially expressed in mammary glands of imf <dig> and control cows, such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  <dig> , connective tissue growth factor , kruppel-like factor  <dig> , fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor c precursor , and s <dig> calcium-bindingproteins a <dig> and a <dig> . likewise, factors regulating wnt signaling , and differentiation of neurons  and muscle  were altered by milking frequency.

multiple genes controlling proliferation of blood vessels were affected by increased milking frequency including down regulation of inhibitors of angiogenesis such as serpinf <dig>  thbs <dig>  timp <dig>  timp <dig> and adipoq  <cit> , and up regulation of pro-angiogenic genes ctgf, nrg <dig> and antxr <dig>  down regulation of several genes that promote angiogenesis  was also observed in imf <dig> cows.

 <dig>  changes related to ecm remodeling
expression of nearly  <dig> genes encoding ecm components or structural elements of the cytoskeleton, participating in cell adhesion, and in regulation of proteolysis was altered by milking frequency. nearly all of these genes were down-regulated in imf <dig> cows and indicated remodeling of ecm and changes in cell adhesion. for instance, only fat <dig>  a member of the cadherin family, pik3r <dig>  an inhibitor of cell adhesion, and ctgf were up regulated by increased milking frequency. genes encoding components of ecm including numerous collagens, versican, elastin, fibulin, fibronectin  <dig>  microfibrillar associated glycoproteins, thrombospondins, myocilin, tenascins, and lumican were down-regulated in mammary gland of imf <dig> cows. furthermore, known regulators of ecm deposition and remodeling  and proteolysis  were down regulated in imf <dig> cows.

 <dig>  changes in metabolism and nutrient transport
differential expression of a number of genes related to metabolism and nutrient transport to support milk secretion was observed in response to milking frequency. specifically, transporters involved in vesicular protein trafficking  and transport of nutrients such as aquaporin  <dig> , several solute carriers  and the fatty acid transporter carnitine o-octanoyltransferase  were up regulated in mammary gland of imf <dig> cows, whereas genes involved in phosphate transport  and copper transport  were down regulated in imf <dig> versus control cows. lastly, expression of multiple metabolism-related genes were altered by increased milking including the increased expression of genes controlling catabolism of udp , glycoproteins  and fatty acids , and biosynthesis of cholesterol , isoprenoids  and prostaglandins . increased milking frequency also suppressed expression of adipoq, an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, and isocitrate dehydrogenase , which functions in fatty acid synthesis.

 <dig>  changes in immune-related genes
increased milking frequency affected expression of several genes that function in immune response and inflammation. for instance, multiple genes within the mhc loci  were differentially expressed in mammary gland of imf <dig> cows compared to control cows. furthermore, genes related to innate immunity including chemokines ccl <dig> and loc <dig>  the complement pathway regulator serping <dig> and pathway member cfb, the interferon-induced genes isg <dig> and fgl <dig>  and the proinflammatory molecule fstl <dig> were down regulated. up regulated genes included those involved in acute-phase response, such as fgg and il1rap, and a regulator of complement activation, hf <dig> 

validation of differential gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr
four genes identified by sage and eleven genes selected to represent a range of differential expression among the up-  and down-regulated  genes identified by microarray were validated by real-time pcr. amplification efficiency of assays ranged from  <dig> to 107% and correlation coefficients of all standard curves were ≥ <dig> . in all cases, the direction of change was confirmed and the correlation of the estimated fold-change between the two methods was extremely high .

immunohistochemistry
consistent with microarray results, normalized pixel abundance for vwf, a biomarker for endothelial cells and vascularity, was measured in sections of d- <dig> biopsies and was numerically greater in imf <dig> cows  than in control cows  . combining results of imf <dig> cows with imf <dig> cows in the analysis further improved this trend  . however, immunostaining for vwf in mammary biopsies collected at d  <dig> of lactation was similar between imf cows and controls .

co-localization of vwf with ki <dig> in d- <dig> biopsies indicated the percentage of dually labeled cells in imf <dig> cows  was numerically greater than in controls  at  <dig>  ±  <dig> % versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively . inclusion of imf <dig> cows  with the imf <dig> data set also improved this trend . measures of d- <dig> biopsies indicated a similar and slightly stronger relationship of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for imf <dig> and control groups, respectively . finally, combining all imf animals  resulted in an even greater increase in mean percentage of vwf/ki <dig> co-localization relative to controls .

discussion
increased milking frequency of 4× daily milking versus 2× daily milking in early lactation of dairy cattle results in a persistent increase in milk yield, well beyond the period of increased milking  <cit> . changes occurring within the mammary gland that may facilitate the increased milk production include increased mammary cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . in the current study, the greatest percentage of genes affected by milking frequency, as determined by microarray, functions in these processes. although changes in gene expression related to cell proliferation in imf <dig> cows were not unidirectional , one would expect to see feedback regulation of genes controlling cell proliferation in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. furthermore, an increase  in 3h-thymidine incorporation at  <dig> d in mammary tissue of imf <dig> cows and a numerical increase in ki <dig> labeling of epithelial cells in the glands of imf <dig> cows at d  <dig> of lactation in the present study  <cit>  supports the hypothesis that changes in gene expression were occurring in the gland that promote mammary epithelial cell proliferation.

changes within the mammary gland related to endothelial cell proliferation were also indicated in response to treatment. in order to support greater milk production, increases in neovascularization and blood flow would be expected within the gland to enhance nutrient delivery to mammary secretory cells. evidence of genetic changes related to angiogenic responses included increased expression of stimulators of blood vessel development and suppression of inhibitors of angiogenesis in imf <dig> cows. because angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process, it is not surprising that down regulation of stimulators of angiogenesis were also observed with the mammary glands of imf <dig> cows. in fact, autocrine regulation of angiogenesis through production of anti-angiogenic factors by endothelial cells is a means by which the balance between growth activation and suppression is maintained  <cit> .

in addition to changes in expression of genes directly affecting blood vessel development, changes in expression of genes promoting ecm remodeling were also indicated in response to increased milking frequency. it has been shown that the ecm is critical in regulating neovascularization and endothelial cell survival  <cit>  and that proteolysis and remodeling of the ecm are necessary to allow for the invasion of new blood vessels  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that changes were occurring within the ecm in response to increased milking that promote neovascularization.

immunolocalization of vwf in mammary sections suggested greater vascularization at approximately d  <dig> in imf <dig> cows relative to control cows, consistent with our microarray data implicating changes in expression of genes that are relevant to neovascularization. to determine whether proliferation of endothelial cells was altered within the gland by milking frequency, we also examined the co-localization of the endothelial cell marker vwf and ki <dig> by immunohistsochemical analysis of mammary sections collected on d  <dig> and d  <dig> of lactation. our results, although not statistically significant, showed consistently numerically greater co-localization in imf cows, which supports our hypothesis that 4× daily milking increased the proportion of proliferating endothelial cells. experiments specifically designed to test this hypothesis using greater numbers of animals and frequent sampling times are warranted. furthermore, additional study is needed to determine whether changes in ecm remodeling and neovascularization precede or lag increases in milk yield to ascertain whether these changes serve as a primary mechanism for the enhancement of milk production, or occur as a result of the increased demand for milk synthesis. of interest, research by lacasse and prosser  <cit>  suggests that increases in mammary blood flow do not result in increases in milk production in lactating goats. even though neovascularization may not be a driving force behind increased milk production during frequent milking, the persistence of increased tissue perfusion may account for the persistence of increased milk production after conclusion of the period of frequent milking.

physiological mechanisms resulting in increased milk yield during more frequent milking may also include increases in renewal of mammary epithelial cells via apoptosis. hale et al.  <cit>  reported an increase in the percentage of apoptotic mammary cells in imf <dig> cows from this study as determined by in situ labeling of apoptotic cells using terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling . at the transcript level, changes in gene expression expected to both enhance and inhibit apoptosis were observed in response to increased milking. for instance, pro-apoptotic genes cidea and cidec and anti-apoptotic genes ifi <dig> and ptn  <cit>  were down regulated, whereas expression of pro-apoptotic genes itpr <dig>  <cit> , rad <dig>  <cit>  and cadm <dig>  <cit>  was increased. in addition, expression of msr <dig>  a protein that may be involved in removal of apoptotic cells was increased in imf <dig> cows.

many of the genes that have a role in apoptosis and were down regulated in imf <dig> cows were those that participate in ecm turnover and cell adhesion. for instance, expression of the integral membrane proteins sfrp <dig> was down regulated and interaction of this protein with ecm has been shown to prevent apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . likewise, vcan and timp <dig> were down regulated, and these proteins have been shown to be protective against apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, the effects of these ecm genes on apoptosis likely are indirect. for instance, loss of cellular contact and signaling with ecm components has been shown to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells by a process termed "vascular pruning"  <cit> . further, interaction of mammary epithelial cells with ecm has been shown to be necessary for prevention of cell death by apoptosis  <cit> . therefore, it appears that increased apoptosis observed within the mammary epithelial and stromal compartments of imf <dig> glands by hale et al.  <cit>  may be mediated in part by ecm turn over.

lastly, it is not surprising that changes were observed in the expression of genes related to immune function and inflammation in response to milking frequency. it has been demonstrated that milk scc, a measure used as a general indicator of mammary infection, increases in the first  <dig> h in response to imf  <cit> . physical stimulation of the mammary gland and milk removal may also increase the infiltration of immune cells to the gland, as it has been shown that scc increases substantially from the beginning to the end of each milking period  <cit> . thus, variation in presence of immune cells within the gland could be reflected by changes in expression of genes functioning in immunity of cows milked 4× daily versus controls. in the present study, scc was measured weekly, but was low in all treatment groups, and no differences in scc were observed in cows milked 4× daily versus controls  <cit> .

there is evidence from field studies to suggest that increased frequency of milking of dairy cattle reduces scc and may be beneficial for herd health  <cit> . in addition, increased frequency of milk removal from the gland increases the physical removal of bacterial cells from the gland. therefore, it would be expected that the incidence of mammary infection would be reduced by imf treatment and that overall expression of genes related to immune function within the mammary gland would be reduced relative to controls. in the present study, changes in gene expression in imf <dig> cows included both down regulation of genes involved in innate immunity, as well as up regulation of acute phase proteins, which appears contradictory. because gene expression was assessed at approximately d  <dig> of lactation and approximately  <dig> d after initiation of 4× daily milking, it is unlikely that changes in health status of the mammary gland due to mammary infection would be evident in such a short time period after the initiation of 4× daily milking. since the milking process itself increases infiltration of immune cells into the mammary gland, differences in gene expression related to immunity between imf <dig> and control cows were likely influenced by the specific population of cells being sampled during biopsy of the gland, and are therefore difficult to interpret.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that increased milking frequency in dairy cattle is associated with alteration of mammary cell-ecm interactions and signaling that support milk synthesis. remodeling of ecm within the gland should enhance mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, promote apoptosis and cell renewal, and promote migration and invasion of endothelial cells. in addition, increased nutrient delivery to mammary epithelial cells via neovascularization and changes in cell metabolism may enhance secretory capacity of the mammary gland during frequent milking. increased vascularization of the tissue may also contribute to the persistence of increased milk production after the period of increased milking frequency. further study is needed to confirm whether the observed changes in gene expression associated with these physiological pathways in fact drive the increases in milk yield during frequent milking, or occur in response to the increase in milk production.
