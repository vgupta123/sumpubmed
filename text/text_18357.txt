BACKGROUND
interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome  is a chronic condition characterized by frequent urination and bladder pain, which often results in reduced quality of life. clinicians experience that this disease is becoming more prevalent
 <cit> . while evidence suggests that about 90% of those affected are female, some urologists consider chronic bacterial prostatitis to be the male equivalent of ic.

the traditional definition of this illness is chronic sterile bladder inflammation of unknown etiology and it has not been possible to prove any causative pathogenic agent for this syndrome
 <cit> . currently there are four major hypotheses of pathogenesis: 1) autoimmunity, 2) deficiency of the glycosaminoglycan layer causing increased bladder wall permeability, 3) neurogenic inflammation and 4) chronic infection
 <cit> .

while several features of ic have suggested an infective etiology, numerous studies using traditional culture techniques have failed to provide consistent evidence that ic is associated with infection. it has been proposed that possible microbial agents causing this disease could be difficult to cultivate or are present in numbers too low to be confirmed in the laboratory
 <cit> . advances in molecular-based diagnostics have made it possible to overcome the limitations of culture-based detection. investigators have used pcr, cloning and 16s ribosomal dna  sequencing to search for pathogenic agents in bladder biopsies and urine specimens of ic patients
 <cit> , but with conflicting results. however, some of these studies have indicated that women with ic may have a higher prevalence of bacteria in the urine than those without ic
 <cit> .

furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated that administration of antibiotics may sometimes be correlated with decreased symptoms in patients
 <cit> . this can be due to both inhibition of bacterial growth or as a conventional anti-inflammatory effect of doxycycline. a study by zhang et al. 
 <cit>  not only demonstrates improvement in symptoms, but also a decreased level of nanobacteria after antibiotic treatment, strongly suggesting a microbial association of ic in some cases.

we recently developed approaches to assess the major microbial populations in female human urine, based on 16s rdna pcr followed by  <dig> pyrosequencing and analyses using a suite of bioinformatics tools  0
 <cit> . we have shown that healthy female  urine is a complex milieu with many different bacteria present. the normal human urine microbiota includes numerous fastidious and anaerobic microbes, which are potentially pathogenic
 <cit> . in this work we applied these techniques in a prospective study to describe the microbial community present in urine from ic patients. we also performed a comparative analysis between the ic sequence dataset and the hf dataset previously generated
 <cit>  to determine to what extent the bacterial profiles differ. our analyses indicate important differences between the two microbiota. we observe a lower complexity and variation between urine from ic individuals in relation to hf individuals.

methods
urine sampling
this study was approved by the regional committee for medical research ethics east –norway , and the samples were taken with informed consent.  <dig> female patients of age from  <dig> to 67 years  underwent thorough clinical examination including cystoscopy and fulfilled the criteria of european society for the study of interstitial cystitis 
 <cit> . all patients had an established diagnosis of ic for more than four years. midstream urine  was collected by the clean catch method with labial separation supervised by an urotherapy nurse. specimens were kept at 4°c, and within an hour processed for dna isolation. all specimens used were culture-negative, as tested by the urological clinic at the university hospital hf aker-oslo. none of the patients was receiving antibiotics at the time samples were taken, nor prior to that according to hospital records.

sample processing and dna isolation
sample processing and dna extraction was performed as previously described in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit> . briefly, urine aliquots  were pelleted by centrifugation and total dna was isolated from sediments using dneasy blood & tissue kit , preceded by incubation with powerlyse  . finally, the dna was eluted in 100 μl of ae buffer from the kit. the dna concentrations in the samples  were measured by quant-it picogreeen dsdna assay kit  and ranged from  <dig>  ng/μl to  <dig>  ng/μl.

16s rdna pcr and 454-pyrosequencing
for each ic urine sample, we amplified 16s rdna sequences using two different primer sets specific for the v1v <dig> and v <dig> hypervariable regions followed by  <dig> pyrosequencing as described in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit> . each of the primers consisted of a target specific region at their 3’ end  and an adapter sequence  at their 5’ end as needed for gs flx amplicon sequencing . equal amounts of the two different amplicons  for a single subject were pooled and sequenced using gs-flx chemistry in the same lane of a pico-titer plate divided into  <dig> lanes, except for samples p <dig>  p <dig> and, p <dig>  for which each amplicon  was sequenced in a separate lane.  <dig> pyrosequencing was performed by the norwegian sequencing centre  at the department of biology, university of oslo, norway.

sequence read preprocessing
sequence read preprocessing was done as described in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit> . in brief, a total of  <dig>  reads were produced from ic female urine samples. the initial sequence reads were split into two pools using the v1v <dig> and v <dig> primer sequences via the sfffile program from  <dig> life sciences , thus reducing the sequences to  <dig>  ic urine reads  due to the program splitting on an exact primer match. with a minimum length cutoff of  <dig> and  <dig> nt for the v1v2- and v6-regions, respectively, the sequences were processed through the pyronoise program
 <cit>  to reduce possible insertion/deletion errors at homopolymer runs. after denoising using pyronoise, one sequence per cluster is retained together with the number of total reads mapping to that cluster.

9chao <dig> is an estimator of the minimum richness and is based on the number of rare otus  within a sample.

10the shannon index combines estimates of richness  and evenness .

11inverse simpson index  is an indication of the richness a community with uniform evenness would have at the same level of diversity. it takes into account the number of otus present, as well as the abundance of each otu.

the bacterial identification technique of broad range 16s rdna pcr is highly sensitive to environmental contamination. to control for this the ic urine sample sequence sets were stripped for sequences that could stem from contamination sources. this was done by using contamination control sequences  from negative control extractions  followed by pcr and pyrosequencing, as reported in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit> . a complete linkage clustering at 1% genetic difference of each sample together with its respective control was performed using esprit . any sample sequences found in clusters where ≥ 50% of the sequences belonged to the contamination control were excluded from subsequent analyses 
 <cit> ).

sequence data generated in this study were submitted to the sequence read archive with the study accession number erp <dig>  the dataset is available at
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/erp <dig> 

taxonomical analysis
for taxonomic grouping of the sequence reads, megan v <dig> 
http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/megan/welcome.html <cit>  was used. first, the sequence reads were compared to a curated version of the ssurdp database
 <cit>  using blastn with a maximum expectation value  of 10- <dig>  to reflect the actual abundance behind every denoised sequence cluster, each entry in the blast result file was replicated as many times as the total number of reads that mapped to that query sequence 
 <cit> ). when comparing the individual datasets using megan, numbers of reads were normalized up to  <dig>  for every dataset.

metastats, statistical methods  for detecting differentially abundant taxa, was used to reveal significant differences between ic urine microbiota and hf urine microbiota . this method employs a false discovery rate to improve specificity in high-complexity environments, and in addition handles sparsely sampled features using fisher’s exact test. the metastats p - values at different taxon levels, which were assigned using megan, are listed in additional file
1: table s <dig>  a p - value ≤  <dig>  was considered significant.

comparative otu based clustering analysis of ic and hf urine
numbers of operational taxonomical units , rarefaction curves and diversity indices were calculated using mothur v <dig> .2
 <cit>  . to enable comparisons, the hf sequences generated in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit>  were reanalyzed along with the ic dataset from this study. briefly, the sequences were aligned to the silva 16s alignment as recommended by mothur
 <cit>  – sequences not aligned or aligned outside of where 95% of all of the sequences aligned were removed from the datasets. for an improved otu clustering single linkage preclustering
 <cit>  was performed, allowing two nucleotides to differ between sequences, before clustering using average linkage. the processing was done both on each separate sample and on pooled v1v <dig> and v <dig> sequences for both ic and hf samples. we also calculated the otus and shannon index for normalized numbers of sequences for each separate sample
 <cit> . a random number of reads, corresponding to the lowest number of sequences in a sample group, i.e.  <dig>  for v1v <dig> and  <dig>  for v <dig>  was picked  <dig> times from each sequence set. these new sequence sets were processed through mothur in the same fashion as the full sequence sets and the average of the resulting otus and shannon values are shown in additional file
2: table s <dig> 

the differences in shannon indices and inverse simpson indices for the two communities  were also statistically evaluated by wilcox rank sum test in r, for both the v1v <dig> and v <dig> amplicon datasets.

venn diagrams were generated for both data sets using mothur to calculate how many otus were shared between the two communities. to further explore the relationships between the two microbial communities, samples were clustered into newick-formatted trees  with distance between communities calculated with θyc coefficient as a measurement of dissimilarity between community structures
 <cit>  in mothur. in addition, weighted unifrac testing
 <cit>  was performed to determine the statistical significance of clustering within the tree. a non-metric multidimensional scaling  plot was generated in r for the distances calculated using θyc measures for each sequence dataset , knowing that θyc weighs rare and abundant otus more evenly than other metrics such as jaccard.

RESULTS
 <dig> pyrosequenced 16s rdna amplicon sequences
after preprocessing of the raw ic  <dig> reads as described in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit> , we obtained a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  16s rdna sequences for v1v <dig> and v <dig> regions, respectively, see table
 <dig>  for comparison purposes, the preprocessing information for the hf urine sequences reported in siddiqui et al. 
 <cit>  is also listed in the table. average number of reads per ic sample was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for v1v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively  see additional file
2: table s <dig>  97% of the preprocessed sequences were classified to phylum, order and family level, and 95% of the sequences were identified down to genus level.

composition of the ic urine microbiota
in total,  <dig> phyla were identified by the 16s rdna sequences when the two different amplicon libraries  were considered together . 93% of the bacterial dna sequences were assigned to firmicutes, while the other 7% were assigned to  <dig> additional phyla. actinobacteria was the second major phylum with 5% of the sequence abundance. bacteroidetes and tenericutes were represented by 1% of total bacterial sequences each, while three phyla – proteobacteria, fusobacteria and nitrospirae – were detected by less than 1% of the assigned sequences.

in comparison to hf urine 
 <cit> ), ic urine has a significantly higher proportion of firmicutes   and reduced proportions of the other  <dig> common phyla . interestingly, the phylum nitrospirae was only detected in ic urine. five additional phyla present in hf urine 
 <cit> ) were not identified in ic urine at all . the distribution of major phyla in ic urine was similar for both the v1v <dig> and v <dig> sequence dataset, although fusobacteria and nitrospirae were only identified by the v <dig> sequence dataset.

sequence reads for all phyla but one  were further classified to order level.  <dig> of the  <dig> orders identified in healthy urine 
 <cit> ) were also detected in ic urine. a significant shift in the bacterial composition was observed as a result of an increase of lactobacillales   in the ic urine microbial community relative to hf urine. 92% and 91% of the reads for v1v <dig> and v <dig> respectively, were assigned to this order. in hf urine only 53% of the reads for v1v <dig> and 55% for v <dig> were assigned to lactobacillales. the abundance of other major orders seen in hf urine is reduced in ic samples .

all sequence reads assigned to the order level were additionally assigned to family level. among the  <dig> families identified, only  <dig> were assigned to different genera. four of those families that were not further assigned  were also detected in the hf urine study. saprospiraceae, on the other hand was only found in ic urine.

at the genus level, the pooled sequences were assigned to  <dig> different genera, with  <dig> and  <dig> different genera for v1v <dig> and v <dig> analysis, respectively. lactobacillus was the most abundant genus in both datasets and comprised a total of 92% of the sequences. gardnerella and corynebacterium were the two other major genera identified with 2% sequence abundance each. prevotella and ureaplasma were each represented by 1% of the sequences assigned. the other  <dig> genera determined in ic urine constituted only 2% of the total ic urine bacterial community.

in contrast to hf urine, there was a considerable reduction in total numbers of genera identified in ic urine  . additionally, the abundance of common genera was found to differ between ic patients and healthy females. the significant increase of lactobacillus  in ic urine compared to hf urine again suggested a structural shift in the microbiota of ic patients. enterococcus, atopobium, proteus and cronobacter are  <dig> genera identified in ic urine that were not detected in our previous hf urine study, while a group of  <dig> genera were only associated with hf urine.

sequences from  <dig> of the genera identified in the ic samples were further assigned to  <dig> different species . when comparing to our previous study,  <dig> of these species are already found in asymptomatic hf urine. however, nine of these species were not identified in our previous study, nor associated with ic according to literature.

variation between individual ic urine samples
a clustering analysis using taxonomical data from both ic and hf individual urine samples is shown in figure
 <dig>  as previously demonstrated for hf urine , variation between individuals was also evident for ic urine samples and a polymicrobial state was identified for all but one of the ic urine specimens. although a clear clustering of samples from the two communities  was not apparent, we observed a narrower taxonomical range and reduced complexity in individual ic urine samples compared to the results from individual hf samples.

in all but two ic urine samples, lactobacillus accounted for more than ~95% of the sequences for both v1v <dig> and v <dig> data. lactobacillus was not only the most abundant genus, but also the most frequent genus among all ic urine specimens with its rrna sequences present in all eight samples, in contrast to urine samples from hf . sequences assigned to prevotella, peptoniphilus and anaerococcus were also frequently detected , followed by staphylococcus and finegoldia , and gardnerella, streptococcus and dialister  in ic urine. including ureaplasma,  <dig> genera were identified by reads belonging to  <dig> urine samples and another  <dig> genera were only detected in  <dig> out of the  <dig> samples.

species richness and diversity
estimation of species richness and diversity were calculated for the two combined v1v <dig> and v <dig> sequence pools , as well as for single urine samples . at the species level, defined as otus at 3% genetic difference,  <dig> species for the v1v <dig> and  <dig>  species for the v <dig> sequence datasets were estimated in the ic urine community. at a more conservative level, defined as otus at 6% dissimilarity level,  <dig> and  <dig> otus were estimated for v1v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively. these numbers for richness are considerably lower than found in hf urine . the number of otus at 3% difference for the individual samples for both ic and hf are indicated in box plots  for both v1v <dig> and v <dig> analysis. in general, fewer number of otu clusters were observed for ic individuals than that for hf individuals. ecological diversity measured by shannon and inverse simpson indices also indicate lower diversity in ic urine in comparison to what was seen in urine from hf . specifically, a significant  decrease in inverse simpson index in ic patients compared to hf was found for the v <dig> analysis. taken together, the results for both v1v <dig> and v <dig> support each other and confirm that the urine community is less diverse in ic patients than in hf individuals. however, the single ic outlier with high richness and diversity  also clustered outside the ic group in the clustering analysis done using taxonomy data  showing that there is also potential for variation within the ic community.

the ic and hf urine also showed a degree of community similarity at 3% sequence dissimilarity level - about 12% and  <dig> % of the total otus for v1v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively, were present in both groups . to further explore the relationships between the two communities, θyc distances, taking into account both community association and relative abundance, were calculated at 3% dissimilarity level for all samples. these distances for both v1v <dig> and v <dig> datasets were then visualized by nmds plots; see figure
4a and b. although an overlap between the two communities is detected, hf urine samples were more dispersed than ic samples. a pattern of less variation between samples from ic patients than for hf samples was suggested. weighted unifrac hypothesis testing for θyc distances confirmed the significance  of the differences observed in the community structure.

discussion
we have characterized the urine microbiota of ic patients using high throughput  <dig> pyrosesequencing of 16s rdna amplicons. these results were compared to hf data from our previous study 
 <cit> ). our results did not reveal any single potential pathogenic bacterium common to all ic patients. however, important differences were detected between the ic and hf microbiota.

the use of primers for both v1v <dig> and v <dig> regions yielded complementary results for ic urine in line with the previous study of hf urine 
 <cit> ), and thus maximized the detection of bacterial diversity.

knowing that urine samples are at risk of contamination by bacterial flora of the female urogential system
 <cit> , mid-stream urine sampling was performed under guidance of an experienced urotherapy nurse. suprapubic puncture was suggested as an alternative method, but the method was considered to be too invasive. interestingly, comparing results from our previous microbiome study on female mid-stream urine 
 <cit>  with recent results from suprapubic aspirate by wolfe et al. 
 <cit> , the major findings are the same; a strong indication that mid-stream urine will give comparable results in a urine microbiome analysis.

a decrease in species richness in ic urine
a decrease in overall richness and ecological diversity  of ic urine microbiota was detected in contrast to hf urine . in addition, the ß-diversity analysis  suggested that the microbiota of hf samples are more dissimilar from each other than the microbiota of ic individuals.

the taxonomical analysis indicated a shift in composition of urine microbiota of ic patients, with changes in bacterial groups spanning from genus to phyla level and a reduction in microbial complexity compared to hf. more importantly, a significant increase in lactobacillus in ic patients was revealed. lactobacillus was detected in every ic urine sample and a total sequence abundance of 92% in contrast to 57% in hf urine was observed. this shift was also clearly displayed both at the order and phylum level . in contrast, prevotella, - a genus belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes  – was present only at 1%, significantly lower than in hf urine, where it was previously reported as one of the major genera with an abundance of 19%. gardnerella, another dominant genus in female urine, was present with the same frequency in ic urine but with a general lower abundance.

a reduction in bacterial diversity and shift in the microbiota as observed in this chronic inflammatory state has also been reported for other clinical conditions such as obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease including crohn’s disease
 <cit> .

bacteria associated with ic
attempts to identify an infectious etiology for ic have not yet found any evidence for a specific pathogen. however, previous culture-dependent studies of samples from ic patients  have reported organisms such as gardnerella, lactobacillus sp., streptococcus ssp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, corynebacterium ssp., klebsiella sp., enterococcus sp., propionbacterium, prevotella, bacteroides sp., and peptostreptococcus <cit> . lactobacillus, gardnerella and streptococcus were repeatedly detected in these studies and were also seen in our study. haarala et al. 
 <cit>  using culture techniques concluded that bacterial flora of midstream urine from patients with ic clearly differs from that of healthy women, in line with our findings. a study by zhang et al. 
 <cit>  suggested nanobacteria as a possible causative agent for ic. the two latter studies also reported a reduction in bacterial levels and urinary symptoms upon antibiotic treatment of the ic patients. the primer pairs both for v1v <dig> and v <dig> amplicons used in our study would be expected to amplify 16s rdna regions of all of the organisms mentioned above. nevertheless we did not identify klebsiella, e.coli, peptostreptococcus or nanobacteria in any of our ic urine samples.

studies reporting results from culture-independent 16s rdna pcr approaches on samples  from ic patients, have yielded somewhat conflicting results both in terms of positive pcrs and the resulting bacterial profiles
 <cit> . while two of the reports
 <cit>  found no evidence of bacterial dna in biopsy and urine specimens from ic patients, dominique et al. 
 <cit>  demonstrated bacterial dna in bladder tissues in 29% of patients with ic. the  <dig> sequences retrieved showed homology to e. coli  and pseudomonas , however neither of these bacteria was found in our study. heritz et al. 
 <cit>  also reported bacterial dna in both biopsies and urines from ic patients . they concluded that there is a difference in the bacterial profile between the patients and controls, and further suggested a link between one or more bacterial species and ic. however, in their study only  <dig> bacterial clones from  <dig> different ic patients were analyzed and the bacterial sequences were related to e.coli, abiotrophia defectivus, veillonella and rothia dentocariosa. except for veillonella, these bacteria were not detected in our study. all these  <dig> previously reported studies used different primer sets  and classical cloning strategies . in contrast, our study represents the first 16s rdna amplicon high throughput sequencing approach on ic urine, increasing both the sensitivity and resolution of the investigation.

significance of lactobacillus in ic urine
lactobacillus has not only been indicated or shown in ic urine samples from females  but also demonstrated in ic urine from a male subject
 <cit> . in our study we also detected a significant increase in abundance of this genus, considering its supposedly commensal presence in human urine from healthy subjects
 <cit> .

lactobacillus is generally considered to be of low virulence, rarely causing infections in humans. it is best known for its presence in vaginal microflora, where it normally generates and maintains a physiological acidic environment, which prevents infections. because of these properties, lactobacillus has been used in probiotics, and is thought to prevent or even treat urinary tract infection 
 <cit> . however, there are increasing indications that specific lactobacillus spp are of pathogenic relevance and may be involved in urinary tract infections
 <cit> .

many female patients with symptoms suggestive of uti, but with culture-negative urines are often treated with antibacterial agents since their symptoms may be indistinguishable from those with a proven uti
 <cit> . it has been proposed that lactobacillus, resistant to widely used antibiotics, may multiply during treatment, giving the genus an advantage over antibiotic-sensitive commensals, and allowing it to invade the proximal urethra and paraurethral tissues causing inflammatory changes
 <cit> . this organism has also been related to the presence of uti symptoms in otherwise culture-negative urines
 <cit> . in a study by maskell et al. 
 <cit>  antibacterial treatment was withheld over the course of 2 years from symptomatic women with culture-negative urine. during the course of the study lactobacilli  gradually disappeared from the urine of most of the patients who also became symptom free. a similar association of lactobacillus and urinary symptoms was reported by darbro et al. 
 <cit> . over a six-month period a female patient had constant symptoms and high counts of lactobacillus spp  in the urine; she became symptom-free with culture-negative urine after treatment with lactobacillus-targeted medication. these results also suggest that a shift in the microbial community towards lactobacillus in ic urine samples may be an important etiological factor for the severe symptoms reported by the patients. since additional culture techniques such as 48 h incubation in an atmosphere containing 7% co <dig> are needed for detection of lactobacillus, this may be the reason why ic urine samples have not yet been associated with bacterial growth in routine clinical investigations. however, in our study this problem was overcome by a culture-independent approach.

CONCLUSIONS
this investigation did not reveal any obvious putative causative bacterial agents of ic. however, the greater abundance of lactobacillus in ic urine and its lower occurrence in hf urine is an important finding that requires further study to establish whether these microbial changes play a part in the development of ic. to this end, whole genome sequencing of lactobacillus from ic patients may be a possible approach. even if an increased presence of lactobacillus is merely a secondary marker, understanding its ic associated genomics could aid in diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.
