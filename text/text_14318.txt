BACKGROUND
natural killer  cells are able to kill viral infected cells directly and produce inflammatory cytokines that limit infection. nk cell activation is controlled by the integration of signals from activation and inhibitory receptors. the nk cells from normal blood donors are usually in inhibitory states, but can be activated, either directly or indirectly, through cd4+ t cells, dendritic cells , monocytes/macrophages, or nkt cells. interferons, and macrophage-derived cytokines, including il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α can contribute to nk cell activation directly in a mhc class i independent manner  <cit> .

nk cells should have anti-wnv properties. however, surprisingly few experiments have been published describing the antiviral activity of nk cells against wnv or other flaviviruses  <cit> . knowledge about nk cells in wnv infection is limited to the analysis of nk cell activity during wnv infections in humans and nk cell depleted mice. infection of mice with wnv transiently activates and then suppresses nk cell activity  <cit> . wnv infection may attenuate nk cell cytotoxicity by increasing cell surface expression of mhc class i molecules  <cit>  to overcome susceptibility to nk cell mediated lysis. splenocytes from wnv immunized mice have poor nk cell lytic activity  <cit> . mice genetically deficient in nk cells or with nk cells depleted by anti-nk cell antibody demonstrate no increased morbidity or mortality for wnv infection when compared to wild type controls  <cit> . thus, at least for wnv infection in mice, nk cells appear to be dispensable for controlling infection and disease, despite their well documented role in combating viral infection in general.

presumably nk cell knockout or nk cell depletion does not promote wnv infection of mice because nk cell functions are effectively inhibited by wnv. nk cells may be able to control wnv infection if this inhibition is alleviated or bypassed. encouraged by recent advancements in cancer treatment with nk cells  <cit> , expanded, activated nk cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in vitro were prepared, and tested for the ability to inhibit wnv in tissue culture. the in vitro expanded nk cells were demonstrated to inhibit wnv infection of vero cells efficiently. this underscores the potential importance of nk cells in controlling wnv infection.

RESULTS
co-culture with radiation killed stimulating cells in vitro significantly expanded nk cells in human pbmc
in co-cultures with  <dig> ×  <dig> lethally radiated k562-mb15-41bbl  stimulating cells in vitro,  <dig> ×  <dig> pbmc were expanded to  <dig> ×  <dig> in  <dig> weeks. cd56+  and cd3+  cells changed from  <dig> % and  <dig> % before expansion to  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively after expansion . the absolute cd56+ cell number increased from about  <dig> million to  <dig> million, or about  <dig> fold. the absolute cd3+ cell number remained the same, but the cd3+/cd56+ ratio changed from about  <dig>  before expansion to about  <dig>  after expansion, or a decrease of about  <dig> logs. since culture medium alone has been well documented to give only about a 2- to 5-fold expansion of cd56+cd3- nk cells  <cit> , a control for this was not included in this experiment. k562d <dig> stimulatory cells disintegrate and disappear over about  <dig> days in the culture. the results in this paper represent more the  <dig> expansions with fresh or frozen pbmc.

expanded nk cells are cytolytic through both natural killing and adcc
d2nk cells expanded by co-culture with k562d <dig> stimulatory cells have been reported to have enhanced cytolytic function against b-lineage cell lines  <cit> . in this study, k <dig> and vero cells were used as target cells because k <dig> is a standard target cell for nk cell cytotoxicity assay and vero cells were used for wnv infection and anti-wnv assays in our protocols. in a 4-hour cytotoxicity assay, d2nk cells expanded with k562d <dig> showed very strong cytotoxicity, compared to nk <dig> and nkl cell lines  <cit> , against uninfected k <dig> target cells at effector:target ratios ranging from 10: <dig> to 1: <dig> . as shown in figure 2b, d2nk cells were cytotoxic to both normal vero cells and wnv infected vero cells, and wnv infection made the vero cells more susceptible to d2nk killing. antibody from wnv-hyperimmune ascetic fluid enhanced d2nk cytotoxicity to wnv infected vero cells by greater than two-fold at the 10: <dig> e:t ratio tested. control ascetic fluid containing unrelated antibody  had no effect on killing , excluding the possibility of nonspecific killing by igg or other components of ascetic fluid in the adcc assay. this result represents  <dig> cytotoxicity assays performed.

expanded nk cells are activated
nk cell related surface receptors other than cd <dig> and cd <dig> were also assessed by facs. nkg2d, nkp <dig>  nkp <dig>  and nkp <dig> are nk cell activation receptors; cd158a, cd158b, nkb <dig>  and nkat <dig> are nk cell inhibitory receptors  <cit> . the results from  <dig> donors are shown in figure  <dig>  the expression rates of the activation receptors  on the nk cells expanded using k562d <dig> are much higher than on the pbmc before expansion. for example, nkg2d+/cd56+ cells increased from 30% in pbmc to more than 95% in d2nk. however, d2nk cells had little influence on expression of inhibitory receptors , with the exception of a reduction of cd158b. cd94+/cd56+, an activating or inhibitory kir  increased from 48% in pbmc to 86% in d2nk .

significant changes in the expression of cytolytic receptors during a number of co-culture experiments were observed. the inhibitory cd158b+/cd56+cells were reduced from 25% in pbmc to 20% in d2nk ; whereas the activating nkp30+/cd56+cells increased from 24% in pbmc to 64% in d2nk, and the activating nkp46+/cd56+cells increased from 58% in pbmc to 73% in d2nk . the most significant change was the activating nkp44+/cd56+ expression, from an almost undetectable  <dig> % in pbmc to 65% in d2nk after expansion. this corresponded to a more than  <dig> fold increase .

because upregulated ifn-γ production is another important characteristic of activated nk cells, the ifn-γ levels in pbmc and d2nk cell culture supernatants were measured. in  <dig> ml cultures containing  <dig> ×  <dig> cells each, d2nk cells produced  <dig> pg/ml vs.  <dig> pg/ml ifn-γ produced by pbmc in  <dig> hours, or about  <dig> fold more ifn-γ produced by d2nk cells than normal pbmc .

nk cells and nk cell culture supernatants inhibited wnv replication in vero cells
as shown in table  <dig>  d2nk cells at  <dig> million/t <dig> flask, and nk cell culture supernatants at a 1: <dig> dilution completely inhibited wnv induced cpe in vero cells until day  <dig> post-infection when cultures were terminated. nk cells at  <dig> million/t <dig> flask, and nk cell culture supernatants at 1: <dig> dilution significantly delayed the wnv induced cpe in vero cells. in control experiments, neither nk cells nor nk cell culture supernatants at the concentrations tested induced cpe in vero cells . the inhibitory effects of nk cells and nk cell culture supernatants on wnv replication in vero cells were further confirmed with taqman rt-pcr of viral rna extracted from the culture supernatants collected on day  <dig> post infection . the nk cells reduced wnv viral load in a cell number dependent manner, and supernatants reduced the wnv viral load in a dose dependent manner.

anti-ifn-γ antibody neutralized nk cell supernatant inhibition of wnv replication in vero cells
when anti-ifn antibodies were individually pre-incubated with d2nk cell culture supernatant, only anti-ifn-γ inhibited the ability of nk cell supernatants to suppress wnv infection of vero cells . in control experiments, supernatant from the irradiated k562d <dig> cells alone had no inhibitory effect on wnv infection of vero cells .

the diluted d2nk cell culture supernatant was incubated with anti-ifn-α, anti-ifn-β, or anti-ifn-γ antibody at 37°c for  <dig> hour before being applied to the wnv infected vero cells.

pretreatment with nk cell supernatants made vero cells resistant to wnv infection
pretreatment of vero cells with d2nk cell supernatant for  <dig> hours, followed by washing and wnv infection reduced the supernatant wnv rna copy numbers by ~ <dig> logs as measured by taqman rt-pcr on day  <dig> post infection. by comparison, pretreatment with control supernatants had no inhibitory effect on wnv rna copy numbers .

discussion
nk cells are activated during a wide variety of viral infections by virus-induced type i ifns. the importance of the nk cell defense against virus infections is highlighted by the susceptibility of mice depleted of nk cells to many experimental infections and by the invasive or disseminated viral disease that is associated with naturally occurring nk cell deficiencies in humans  <cit> . however, many viruses, including wnv, have developed mechanisms to evade the nk cell response. these mechanisms include expression of mhc class i homologs encoded by viruses, selective modulation of mhc class i protein expression, inhibition of activating receptor function and production of cytokine-binding proteins or cytokine-receptor antagonists encoded by viruses  <cit> . these mechanisms also include direct viral effects on nk cells, such as infection of nk cells and viral envelope protein blockage of non-class i nk cell inhibitory receptors  <cit> . mice genetically deficient in nk cells or depleted of nk cells by anti-nk cell antibody demonstrated no increased morbidity or mortality compared to controls when infected with wnv  <cit> . however, it would seem that this apparent lack of nk protection is only because wnv normally suppresses or bypasses the nk response. therefore, it is reasonable to expect that blocking the viral evasion process and reinforcing nk cell function might lead to improved control and accelerated clearance of the viral infection.

co-culture of pbmc with k562d <dig> not only expanded nk cells over a hundred fold, but also activated nk cells. all of the activating receptors tested including nkg2d, nkp <dig>  nkp <dig>  and nkp <dig> were upregulated after expansion. most noticeably, nk cells expressing the natural cytotoxicity receptor, nkp <dig>  were up regulated from only  <dig> % before to  <dig> % after expanding, which corresponds to a greater than 200-fold increase. consistent with the upregulated natural killing receptors, the d2nk cells are more potent in killing k <dig> target cells  than either the nk <dig> or nkl cell lines. the inhibitory markers in d2nk cells showed very small changes, although cd158b appeared to be modestly downregulated. further studies would be required to determine whether the small cd158a downregulation is statistically significant. the upregulation of the activation receptors combined with the possible downregulation of one of the inhibitory receptors suggest an overall bias towards an activation profile in d2nk cells. the upregulation of the ifn-γ production of d2nk cells  with no detectable il- <dig>  both before and after expansion further confirmed the activation status of the d2nk cells. we have tried to measure tgf-β production by d2nk, but have so far been unable to detect tgf-β above the high background concentration of tgf-β in the culture medium. we have not yet attempted to expand nk cells in serum-free medium.

the nk cell lines, nk <dig> and nkl, have efficacy disadvantages compared to d2nk. both cell lines have less natural killing activity than d2nk . nk <dig> has no adcc activity because it lacks fcr and nkl has only weak adcc in our assays . d2nk shows strong adcc . adcc activity has been shown to play an important role in anti-cancer therapy and in the light of data presented here may warrant assessment for function in combating wnv infection. the wnv infected vero cells are more susceptible to d2nk killings than normal vero cells by both adcc and natural killing. it should be interesting to further study the underneath mechanisms.

the inhibition of wnv replication by nk cells delivered prior or post infection observed in this study, suggests the possibility of controlling wnv infection by adoptive transfer of nk cells expanded in vitro. it remains to be determined whether the direct cytotoxicity and adcc or the endogenous production of ifn-γ afforded by these expanded nk cells provides advantages over alternative treatments for wnv such as direct administration of ifn-γ.

CONCLUSIONS
co-culture of human pbmc with irradiated k562d <dig> stimulatory cells together with medium supplemented with il- <dig> efficiently expanded and activated nk cells, as measured by ifn-γ production, direct cytotoxicity, adcc and surface expression of nk activation markers. the in vitro expanded d2nk cells and their culture supernatant inhibited wnv infection of vero cells. these results help characterize the potential role of nk cells in wnv infection and demonstrate that nk cells are capable of combating wnv infections in the right conditions.
