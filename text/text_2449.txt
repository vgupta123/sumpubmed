BACKGROUND
mountain landscapes form a matrix of mountain-top ‘sky islands’ , high-elevation ridges and intervening low-elevation habitat. this creates a discontinuous and fragmented landscape with features such as valleys and river drainages forming potential barriers to gene flow for species restricted to high elevations  <cit> . the scope of these barriers has changed over time. for example, recent warming and consequent upslope distribution shifts have driven fragmentation of previously continuous alpine populations  <cit> . in contrast, widespread cooling during the pleistocene glacial periods  is thought to have created corridors of suitable habitat between currently isolated mountain ranges  <cit> . such large-scale climatic fluctuations have left signatures in the genetic structure of high-elevation taxa worldwide .

during pleistocene climate cycles, the creation of habitat corridors and tracking of cooler climates to low elevations would have reduced the effective distance between populations and enabled migration of alpine species between previously-isolated mountains  <cit> . alternatively, glaciation might have driven population contraction to lowland refugia, driving deep lineage divergence across different mountain ranges . different patterns are evident across mountain systems that vary in their continuity, extent and ecological characteristics  of the focal species. these patterns have most frequently been explored in mountain systems of north america and europe, which extend across hundreds of kilometres. in australia, high-elevation areas are highly fragmented but distances between distinct mountain regions are much smaller – usually less than  <dig> km . alpine and sub-alpine habitats are confined to a relatively small  area of southeastern australia, with most of this area within the states of victoria and new south wales    <cit> . during the pleistocene, alpine/sub-alpine conditions would have extended to lower elevations, connecting some, if not all, of these regions  <cit> . at the same time, lack of large-scale glacial activity may have allowed persistence of populations in high-elevation areas  <cit> . in victoria , high endemism and strong divergence among arthropod populations across mountains points to a stable system in which populations have persisted on mountain summits through past climate cycles  <cit> . nevertheless, the limited geographic scope of genetic studies in the australian alps area to-date  – a consequence of the highly restricted distributions of most australian alpine taxa – means that patterns of genetic structure across the remainder of the high country remain poorly understood.figure  <dig>

several features of the victorian and kosciuszko mountain regions suggest that patterns of historic and contemporary population structure are likely to differ between them. first, while alpine and sub-alpine habitat in victoria is highly fragmented, currently separated into four main areas by low-elevation agricultural land, the kosciuszko region comprises largely contiguous alpine/sub-alpine habitat contained within reserved land. although the kosciuszko region has few isolated peaks, mt jagungal , which marks the northernmost point of the this region, is separated from the main range by approximately  <dig> km of sub-alpine plains . second, the highest areas of the kosciuszko region experienced some glaciation during pleistocene climate cycles – the only area of the australian mainland to do so  <cit> . a recent study of wind-dispersing poa grasses found no genetic structure within the kosciuszko region, with significant divergence only apparent among isolated mountains in southern victoria  <cit> . however, species with low dispersal ability are likely to show greater structure .

the most extensive areas of alpine and sub-alpine habitat in australia, lying within the kosciuszko region in new south wales and the bogong high plains in victoria, are separated by approximately  <dig> km of lowland across the murray river valley, which also marks the state border . this geographic discontinuity represents a significant divergence point for several alpine reptile and mammalian species . for example, the skink egernia guthega, an alpine endemic, shows an average  <dig> % mitochondrial  sequence divergence between a population from kosciuszko and three populations from the bogong high plains. however, no genetic structure across this valley was detected among alpine poa  <cit> . thus, with the exception of poa  <cit> , the restricted distributions of species studied to-date provides no means to assess the context of the kosciuszko-bogong high plains break within the broader alps area.

in this study, we examine the importance of broad-scale geographic discontinuities in shaping patterns of genetic structure in the australian high country. in particular, we explore the following questions:  at the relatively small spatial scale of australia’s high country, what is the extent of lineage divergence among and within regions and does the timing of divergence relate to pleistocene glacial cycles?  are differences in geographic structure and historic climate between the victorian and kosciuszko mountains regions reflected in lower historic and contemporary genetic structure in the latter?  to what extent does the gap between kosciuszko and the bogong high plains represent a primary divergence point? we investigate these questions using phylogenetic and population genetic frameworks, with markers of different temporal resolutions to capture signatures of both current range fragmentation and potential distribution shifts in the past.

the grasshopper kosciuscola tristis  was identified as an ideal species in which to explore these genetic patterns. although restricted to australia’s alpine and sub-alpine habitat, primarily above  <dig> m, it is abundant and its distribution stretches from mt baw baw in the south to mt jagungal in the north . this gives it one of the largest ranges of any mountain-endemic animal in australia and makes it an ideal model for testing broad-scale phylogeographic patterns in this system. like many alpine insects, k. tristis is flightless and, consequently, is likely to have limited dispersal abilities over the distances separating major mountain regions. two subspecies are described  <cit> , with k. tristis tristis occurring in the kosciuszko region and k. tristis restrictus on the mt buffalo plateau . rehn  <cit>  also describes victorian populations from mt hotham and the bogong high plains as morphologically intermediate between the two proposed subspecific forms. we thus predicted  genetic divergence across the murray river valley, and  that k. tristis from mt buffalo would be genetically distinct from other populations of k. tristis. some study has been made of the genetic structure of this species  <cit> , providing a basis from which to extend the research to cover a greater geographic extent.

RESULTS
phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity
in total,  <dig> individuals were sequenced, representing  <dig> unique co <dig> haplotypes and  <dig> unique its <dig> haplotypes. of these,  <dig> co <dig> and  <dig> its <dig> haplotypes were represented in the kosciuszko region, with the remainder from populations in victoria. mean co <dig> sequence divergence between haplotypes in victoria was five times that of the kosciuszko region , and nucleotide diversity was also greater in victoria .

the maximum likelihood co <dig> phylogeny indicates strong statistical support for a southern victorian clade incorporating populations from mt baw baw, mt buller and mt stirling. within this group, further geographic structure was apparent with good support for the monophyly of haplotypes from mt baw baw and from mt buller . we found no statistical support for phylogeographic structure across the remaining mountains, although mt buffalo  did cluster. mt hotham showed a particularly interesting pattern, with haplotypes falling out in several places on the phylogeny and two individuals – potentially hybrids – showing strong divergence from the other haplotypes. the its <dig> data, however, placed mt hotham with the southern victorian mountains . in contrast to the co <dig> phylogeny, its <dig> sequences showed divergence between the kosciuszko region and the bogong high plains , with populations from each region represented by one primary haplotype .figure  <dig>

there was an average  <dig> %  sequence divergence between co <dig> haplotypes from the southern victorian mountains and those from the bogong high plains and kosciuszko. this corresponds to divergence  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma  using a divergence rate of  <dig> % or  <dig> % myr− <dig> respectively. within these southern mountains, divergence of the mt baw baw clade was estimated at  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma  based on a  <dig> %  mean sequence divergence, and the mt buller clade at  <dig>  ma  with  <dig> %  sequence divergence. we were unable to give an estimated divergence time between populations from the bogong high plains and kosciuszko as there was no phylogenetic split based on co <dig> data.

microsatellite data: null alleles and diversity
due to poor amplification of some loci in victoria  we split the data into two. the first dataset consisted of all  <dig> populations sampled  with five microsatellite loci  and the second included the six populations from the kosciuszko region  and eight loci .

the two datasets contained 20% and 14% missing data, respectively. after correcting for multiple comparisons, only one pair of loci at one site showed significant linkage disequilibrium. all loci deviated from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  in at least one of the sampled sites, with locus ktr <dig> showing the highest level of deviation, departing from hwe at all sites. the other loci that deviated from hwe did so in 4– <dig> of the seven victorian populations and in 1– <dig> of the six kosciuszko populations. microchecker  <cit>  indicated the presence of null alleles at four loci: ktr <dig>  ktr <dig>  ktr <dig> and ktr <dig>  with estimated null allele frequencies for these loci between  <dig>   and  <dig>   .

the five-locus dataset of  <dig> populations harboured  <dig> alleles across the five loci , while  <dig> alleles were detected across the eight loci in the kosciuszko dataset . although observed heterozygosity was generally low , likely due to the presence of null alleles, genetic diversity measured by expected heterozygosity was high  and varied little across sites  .table  <dig>

genetic variation was measured as nucleotide diversity and haplotype number for co1; nucleotide diversity was not calculated for its <dig> as variation was very low. observed heterozygosity , expected heterozygosity  and mean allelic richness  were calculated for five microsatellite loci that amplified across all populations, as well as for eight loci typed for the kosciuszko populations.



population genetic structure
deviations from hwe and the presence of null alleles means that estimates of f-statistics are problematic and should be treated cautiously. nevertheless, we present fst values, corrected for null alleles, and f’st values as measures of divergence for comparability. the patterns of structure presented below, detected using fst, principal components analysis and bayesian clustering analyses are concordant.

there was significant pairwise differentiation between  <dig> of  <dig> site pairs in the five-locus dataset, and between  <dig> of  <dig> pairs in the kosciuszko dataset, after a correction for null alleles using the ena method , although fst values were generally low . the exceptions were falls creek-mt cope , mt buller-mt stirling , thredbo  <dig> – mt tate , thredbo 1-thredbo  <dig>  and thredbo 2-thredbo  <dig> . the greatest differentiation was observed between populations from the kosciuszko region and those from victoria .

these broad-scale patterns were supported by the discriminant analysis of principal components, which indicated clear differentiation of geographic groups . in particular, the kosciuszko region represented a robust cluster with 93% of individuals correctly assigned to the region, compared to 83% and 84% for the southern victorian and bogong high plains clusters, respectively.figure  <dig>

population structure was also assessed with the bayesian assignment method implemented in tess, which supported five clusters in the five-locus dataset  and six clusters in the kosciuszko dataset . strong regional divergence was again evident: three clusters were almost exclusively assigned to individuals from victoria , while the remaining clusters were largely exclusive to the kosciuszko region. the bogong high plains region showed equivalent admixture proportions from clusters associated with southern victoria and the kosciuszko region , in addition to a distinct local cluster representing an average 57% of individual admixture proportions. in victoria, mt buffalo and mt baw baw were characterised by very high single-cluster assignment . similarly, in the kosciuszko region, the isolated peak of mt jagungal showed high single-cluster assignment .figure  <dig>

spatial patterns of genetic divergence
we tested for isolation-by-distance  in both the microsatellite and co <dig> datasets, and examined this pattern in the victorian and kosciuszko regions alone, as well across all populations. there was significant isolation-by-distance in both the microsatellite : r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; victoria : r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; kosciuszko: r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and co <dig> , datasets. within the kosciuszko region, however, co <dig> sequence divergence showed no relationship with geographic distance .

discussion
the topographic complexity of mountain landscapes, coupled with large-scale climatic fluctuations, has shaped the evolution and population structure of high-elevation species worldwide . in the comparatively small  and geologically stable australian high country, we found genetic divergence associated with discontinuities in alpine and sub-alpine habitats. four primary genetic groups were identified across the kosciuszko region of new south wales and mountain areas of victoria, with the greatest structure evident in the latter. here we discuss population structure within kosciuszko and victoria, genetic structure across major geographic breaks and the extent to which patterns in australia parallel  those in larger mountain systems.

within-region structure
the kosciuszko alpine region contains australia’s highest mountains and the most extensive area of alpine and sub-alpine habitat. despite this, previous work in a variety of taxa  has shown low genetic structure within this region. likewise, we found no phylogeographic structure in k. tristis. an absence of isolation-by-distance suggests either very high gene flow over a long period of time or incomplete lineage sorting following relatively recent colonisation  <cit> . we suggest the latter is more likely. the slopes on and near mt kosciuszko are the only areas of mainland australia where glacial formations during the pleistocene are known to have occurred  <cit> . in addition to concurrent changes in the distribution and structure of vegetation  <cit> , k. tristis has poor cold tolerance  and may thus have retreated to refugia during glacial periods. subsequent recolonization during interglacial periods could lead to low diversity and low regional structure – a pattern which is seen among many alpine taxa in the northern hemisphere  <cit> .

in contrast to the lack of phylogenetic structure, microsatellite data suggested significant population differentiation across small spatial scales  coupled with a strong signature of isolation-by-distance. this could reflect more recent differentiation. in particular, we report a new genetic break, with unambiguous clustering of individuals from mt jagungal, which is separated from kosciuszko proper by  <dig> km of sub-alpine plains at around ~  <dig> m elevation – also the lower-elevation limit of k. tristis in the area. patterns of recent, fine-scale population differentiation  are common across high-elevation taxa – even among species with high dispersal ability . habitat features such as forest fragments within high-elevation meadows, topographic relief and water availability have been identified as putative dispersal barriers . although sub-alpine and alpine habitats are largely contiguous within the kosciuszko region, as far north as mt jagungal, grasshoppers are patchily distributed throughout the landscape . this is likely to reflect microhabitat variation which, in turn, could be driving the genetic differentiation across small geographic distances within the kosciuszko region.

victoria’s high country is highly fragmented, with disjunct mountain regions separated by  <dig> to  <dig> km. in line with our predictions that populations from this region would thus show stronger genetic structure than those from kosciuszko, divergence and diversity were both higher within victoria. despite this pattern of generally high regional divergence, however, the bogong high plains and mt buffalo showed low differentiation. mt buffalo contains several endemic flora and fauna species  <cit> , showed strong phylogeographic isolation in four other alpine invertebrates  <cit>  and emerged as one of few distinct genetic clusters in wind-dispersed alpine poa grasses  <cit> . it was therefore surprising to find no support for a distinct mt buffalo clade in our phylogenetic analyses, particularly as this would correspond to the subspecies described from morphological data  <cit> . as for populations within the kosciuszko region, however, assignment analyses based on microsatellite data suggest that this population is genetically distinct from those of the adjacent bogong high plains. mutations arise rapidly in microsatellites  <cit> , and this differentiation could suggest recent population isolation.

evolutionary history of the australian alps
rapid cooling and drying in southeastern australia during the late miocene to pliocene  is thought to have promoted the evolution of the cold-adapted sub-alpine and alpine biota, with this species assemblage persisting through subsequent climatic shifts . this corresponds to estimated dates of divergence among the four mainland kosciuscola species  <cit> . divergence time estimates for the southern victorian , and subsequently, mt baw baw and mt buller clades , are consistent with the intense climate cycling of the pleistocene  <cit> . a lack of current gene flow is indicated by an absence of widespread haplotypes and haplotype sharing only between proximate populations  <cit> .

depression of the snowline during glacial periods is thought to have resulted in continuous alpine/sub-alpine conditions from mt jagungal into southern victoria  <cit> . while this depression might have facilitated range expansion and, consequently, low differentiation across the alpine area as a whole  <cit> , previous studies on geographic subsets of australia’s high country have found high endemism among mountain suggesting relatively stable population histories and isolation among mountains  <cit> . in particular, considering both the sequence and microsatellite datasets, we identify four primary genetic groups: two southern victorian groups comprising mt baw baw and mt buller/mt stirling; a bogong high plains cluster comprising the bogong high plains proper and mt buffalo; and a kosciuszko cluster.

one of the most surprising results to emerge in this study was the inconsistent support for the  well-studied phylogeographic break between the kosciuszko and bogong high plains regions, across the murray river valley. approximately  <dig> km separates alpine/sub-alpine habitats on either side of the valley but two of five previous studies  <cit>  have not found significant genetic structure. from both sequences and microsatellite data, we suggest that there is significant divergence between k. tristis populations from mt kosciuszko and the bogong high plains. perhaps more importantly, however, our data suggest that the murray river valley  may not be the greatest point of divergence among alpine taxa .

the australian alps in a global perspective
for high-elevation taxa in north america and europe, phylogeographic patterns reflect contrasting population histories of glacial and interglacial expansion and contraction . in many respects, our phylogenetic results mirror those from mountains in the northern hemisphere – phylogeographic breaks among widespread mountain regions contrast with shallow historical divergence within ranges  <cit> . however, mountain regions in australia are of a different scale to those most often studied – peaks are separated by tens of kilometres, rather than by hundreds of kilometres, and alpine/sub-alpine habitat is confined to just  <dig> vertical metres. further, all current high-mountain regions on mainland australia are thought to have been connected by alpine/sub-alpine conditions during glacial periods. given that the processes typically invoked to explain distribution shifts and demographic change - such as ice sheet formation – are not applicable to much of the australian high country, and that distances among mountain regions are relatively small, it is remarkable that strong lineage divergence  is clearly evident. indeed, sequence divergence was akin to estimates of inter-specific divergence among alpine grasshoppers in the north american rocky mountains  <cit> , and across the mountains of europe  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite the small spatial scale and past intermittent connectivity of australian alpine and sub-alpine habitats, consistent patterns of divergence among the two molecular datasets indicate differentiation, associated with geographic breaks in alpine/sub-alpine habitat, that has persisted through glacial cycles and into the present. populations from peaks within the highly fragmented victorian high country showed much greater population structure than those from the more continuous kosciuszko region and structure patterns indicate that the former is comprised of at least three distinct genetic groups. the microsatellite data, although problematic, suggests more fine-scale and possibly more recent structure than either co <dig> or its <dig>  and genetically distinct populations corresponding to the northern- and southern-most parts of the species’ range and to the described sub-species k. tristis restrictus. the evolutionary histories of these peaks, particularly the under-studied mt jagungal, need to be assessed further. the wide alpine/sub-alpine distribution and ecological characteristics of k. tristis make it a good model for exploring associations between genetic markers and adaptive processes across the australian high country.
