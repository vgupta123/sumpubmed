BACKGROUND
giardia intestinalis  is a flagellated protozoan parasite that belongs to the diplomonad group, which includes both parasitic and free living species. during the course of evolution this organism has adapted to a parasitic life-style, which involves passing through an infectious cyst stage and subsequently into the vegetative trophozoite stage. g. intestinalis infects humans and a broad range of other mammals including wild and domestic animals, and causes diarrhea. the parasite spreads through the fecal-oral route and constitutes a serious health problem in developing countries, where it contributes to malnutrition and growth inhibition in children  <cit> . in industrialized countries, waterborne outbreaks of g. intestinalis continue to be a health concern in public water supplies and recreational waters. highly resistant g. intestinalis cysts are able to survive from weeks to months in cold water, and the infectious dose can be as low as  <dig> cysts  <cit> . many g. intestinalis infections do not give rise to symptoms and chronic carriers of g. intestinalis have been documented and these are sources of new infective cysts  <cit> . in addition to being an important mammalian pathogen g. intestinalis is an interesting model organism since it has been suggested to be a primitive, early-branching eukaryote. however, recently a number of eukaryotic features have been described in g. intestinalis  <cit> : a putative nucleolus has been identified  <cit> ; a vestigial mitochondrial organelle called the mitosome has been confirmed  <cit> ; and the prokaryote-like metabolic pathways that have been identified are most probably a result of horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . even so, g. intestinalis is unusual by having two identical and transcriptionally active nuclei, no peroxisomes as well as a lack of a recognizable stacked golgi-apparatus in vegetative cells  <cit> . the genome of g. intestinalis is small  compared to most sequenced eukaryotic genomes and was first described by morrison et al  <cit> . each nucleus of the best studied g. intestinalis isolate wb contains a diploid set of  <dig> major chromosomes that are inherited individually  <cit> . substantial karyotype variability has been reported among g. intestinalis isolates, most likely caused by the hypervariable subtelomeric regions  <cit> . compared to some other unicellular species, eg. trichomonas vaginalis, trypanosoma cruzi, and even the diplomonad spironucleus vortens, the g. intestinalis genome has not undergone a massive repeat expansion, possibly due to evolutionary constraints that act upon the genome or because a large scale proliferation of mobile elements has not occurred. the genome of g. intestinalis is compact in terms of intergenic space and non-coding regions. promoters and untranslated regions are minimal and only four introns have been identified  <cit> , which is consistent with the features of a compact genome.

g. intestinalis has previously been considered to be a single species, mainly due to similarity in morphology between different isolates. however, based on the genetic variation between strains, g. intestinalis can be considered to be a species complex  <cit> . seven assemblages  have been confirmed as distinct evolutionary lineages, by enzyme electrophoretic pattern studies and phylogenetics  <cit> . moreover, sequence analysis has been used to stratify isolates into these groups, mainly based on the genes glutamate dehydrogenase, beta-giardin, elongation factor- <dig> alpha, triose phosphate isomerase and small subunit rrna. furthermore, a growing number of studies have shown phenotypic differences regarding metabolism and biochemistry, growth rates , drug sensitivity, ph preference, infectivity, susceptibility to the g. intestinalis dsrna virus and clinical features  <cit> . however, no genetic factors guiding host specificity or adaptability have been identified so far, possibly due to the limited genetic tools available for g. intestinalis.

assemblages a and b are the only assemblages known to infect humans, c and d infect dogs, group e infects hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, water buffaloes and mufflons, f infects cats and g is restricted to rodents. one recent study analyzed the genetic variation from a large number of assemblage a and b isolates  <cit> . it has been proposed that assemblages a and b are distinct species, with the species names g. duodenalis for assemblage a and g. enterica for assemblage b  <cit> . however, the degree of genetic variation between other assemblages than a and b is largely unknown.

whole genome data is important to establish phylogenetic relationships, to identify genotype specific markers for epidemiological studies and offers a novel approach to understand the genetic diversity on the subspecies level. furthermore, comparative genomics is a powerful tool to reveal insights into the evolutionary history of microbial pathogens and can provide information as to how host specificity and virulence is determined. the genome-wide genetic variation in the g. intestinalis species complex remains largely unexplored, so far only two isolates from two assemblages have been subject to whole genome sequencing. the first g. intestinalis genome to be sequenced was the wb isolate . the wb genome was found to be  <dig>  mb in size with  <dig> annotated coding sequences, extremely low levels of allelic sequence heterozygosity  and no known identifiable virulence factors  <cit> . more than 50% of the annotated coding sequences showed no similarity to any protein sequence in public databases, but of the genes with a functional annotation many are likely to represent lateral transfers from bacteria or archaea  <cit> . we previously reported genome sequencing and analysis of the assemblage b isolate gs and comparative genomics to the wb genome revealed a well conserved core of genes, but also extensive genomic rearrangements  <cit> . the gs isolate was found to have an abundance of allelic sequence heterozygosity as detected by high throughput sequencing. moreover, a comparison of three genetically divergent g. intestinalis isolates allows improved annotation of protein coding genes and non-coding rnas.

to further understand the biological differences between human- and non-human infective isolates of g. intestinalis we here present a draft genome sequence and analysis of the assemblage e isolate p <dig>  originally isolated from a piglet in the czech republic. this is the first whole genome analysis of a field isolate of g. intestinalis with minimal cultivation in the laboratory. we therefore expect it to closely reflect a wild-type g. intestinalis isolate.

RESULTS
genome assembly and allelic sequence heterozygosity
clustering of the shotgun reads  and manual finishing of the assembly resulted in  <dig> contiguous sequences  with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and an average genome coverage of 47Ã—. the relatively large number of contigs is likely to be caused by the presence of genomic repeats rather than areas of insufficient sampling. the combined contig length was  <dig> , <dig> bp. the haploid genome size is likely to be somewhat larger, due to the collapse of certain repeat regions.

the g + c content of the overall assembly is 47%, which is identical to gs but differs slightly from wb . the lower g + c content in p <dig> and gs is most likely explained by non-perfect assembly of g + c rich repeat regions, such as vsps or high cysteine membrane proteins in the whole genome shotgun data sets. to circumvent the problem of different degree of assembly completion, we examined the g + c content of conserved syntenic genes  and found the g + c content to be 46% , 47%  and 49% . orthologs in p <dig> have the lowest average g + c content while wb have the highest.

only  <dig> positions of  <dig> , <dig> analyzed positions passed the criteria for allelic sequence heterozygosity. most heterozygous positions were located in short contigs and may therefore represent artifacts, for example chimeric contigs, rather than a real heterozygosity. none of the heterozygous positions were located in genes that have previously been used for genotyping.

the assembly contains  <dig> frame shifted genes,  <dig> of which were found to be interrupted by single base insertion or deletion errors which is consistent with the homopolymer sequencing errors related to the  <dig> technology. six genes were present in regions where the assembly is of low quality. five frame shifted genes could not be attributed to homopolymer sequencing errors or low coverage in the assembly and were designated as putative pseudogenes, these are described further below .

genome annotation and prediction
the vast majority of the p <dig> annotations were assigned using the information from the wb and gs genomes . the p <dig> draft genome sequence was found to contain  <dig> annotated protein coding sequences, of which  <dig> were conserved hypothetical genes. about 91% of the annotated genes had orthologs in wb. genes without assigned orthologs were located in genomic regions without conserved synteny compared to the previously published giardia genomes. the average protein identity between p <dig> and wb was 90%  and for the corresponding nucleotide sequences the identity was 87% . only 15% of the ortholog pairs showed a nucleotide identity higher than 90%. the average protein identity between p <dig> and gs was 81%  and the nucleotide identity 77% . the higher average protein identity confirmed earlier phylogenetic studies  <cit>  that showed assemblage e to be more closely related to assemblage a than assemblage b to a. furthermore, 82% of the p <dig> genome assembly was identified as coding. the divergence between p <dig> and wb is close to what is observed between leishmania major and l. infantum and the divergence between gs and wb is similar to that observed between theileria parva and t. annulata .

the giardia core proteome and polymorphisms
the giardia gene content can be subdivided into a core set of housekeeping genes and structural genes , unique assemblage-specific genes and a more variable part of the genome that contains members of large gene families . the core genes contain conserved positional orthologs between p <dig>  wb and gs. the ratio of non-synonymous  and synonymous  nucleotide changes was used to estimate the selective pressure on genes. in two comparisons  synonymous changes were found to be saturated and the ratio is not reliable. p <dig> and wb orthologs  were used to calculate dn/ds in order to evaluate if certain genes have a differential evolutionary rate in giardia.

the distribution of dn/ds values displayed a left skew with a peak around  <dig>  , implying that most genes are under purifying selection. some  <dig> genes were found to be perfectly conserved in pairwise comparisons between the three genomes when comparing on the amino acid level . among the genes with the highest dn/ds appeared uncharacterized genes, possibly due to a relaxation of the selective pressure or because of their importance in parasite adaptability. using a slimmed gene ontology we mapped  <dig> giardia genes to  <dig> broad categories , which represent about 20% of the core gene content. the dn/ds distributions were grouped according to biological process go category and the categories were found to be different from each other using a kruskal-wallis test. five go categories were significantly different using a mann-whitney test when compared to all other genes: protein metabolic process; nucleic acid metabolic process; primary metabolic process; translation; transport.

a orthologs refer to positional orthologs. genes truncated in contig ends are not included.

b the rate of nonsynonymous and nucleotide variation. calculated using the program yn <dig> 

c the rate of synonymous and nucleotide variation. calculated using the program yn <dig> 

publicly available serial analysis of gene expression  data was used to group giardia genes into  <dig> developmental categories and one category for constitutively expressed genes . hierarchical clustering of data from  <dig> sage libraries have been used to construct the following developmental categories: excystation; differentiation; encystation; cyst/excystation; trophozoite/encystation; cyst/excystation genes that are downregulated; constitutively expressed genes  <cit> . the distribution of dn/ds ratios was examined and the groups were found to be different from each other using a kruskal-wallis test. four categories were found to be significantly different when compared to all other groups using a mann-whitney test: constitutively expressed genes; trophozoite/encystation; cyst/excystation; differentiation. the differentiation group contain the smallest number of genes .

small insertion-deletion  events were found to be abundant between orthologs. we produced three-way alignments of orthologous genes in gs, p <dig> and wb in order to identify lineage specific adaptions. alignment gaps were interpreted as indel events along the branches of the phylogenetic tree , gs). in order to find lineage specific indels, we defined an indel event as an alignment gap in one lineage that did not occur in the other two lineages, or correspondingly that one lineage lacked an alignment gap but a gap of the same length and start position was present in the two other lineages. the requirement of the same gap length and start position was implemented since gaps of different lengths would be caused by more than one indel event. furthermore, a quality filter was implemented where  <dig> bp downstream and upstream of the genes was examined for mismatches and if more than  <dig> mismatches were identified the indel was rejected. indels located in non-coding sequences were not considered because of the risk of inaccurate alignments. some  <dig> indels were found to be specific for the p <dig> lineage . the median deletion length was  <dig> bp and the median insertion length  <dig> bp. the most common length of an indel was  <dig> bp and the longest indel was  <dig> bp. some  <dig> indels  were found for the wb lineage.

differential distribution of genes
comparisons between the three giardia isolates revealed the presence of genes specific for each isolate . in terms of specific genes, the p <dig> isolate has a few more  than gs, while the wb isolate has the smallest subset . the identified genes are not members of the large giardia gene families and most of them have no sequence similarity to known sequences and their functions are therefore unknown. one p <dig> specific gene  encodes an acetyl transferase. blast searches indicated high similarities to bacterial homologs of the gene. a phylogenetic analysis showed that this p <dig> gene clusters with bacterial sequences, mostly from a low g+c gram positive group  suggestive of a recent gene acquisition . the donor lineage cannot be determined due to poor bootstrap support values and likely frequent transfer of the gene among bacteria. nevertheless, many of the putative donor lineages  are common inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals . this is consistent with a recent uptake of the gene from intestinal bacteria.

in this comparison,  <dig> gs specific genes were identified, and several conserved bacterial domains were identified in these genes as reported previously  <cit> . p <dig> and wb share only  <dig> genes that are not present in gs . in comparison, wb and gs share only one specific protein whereas p <dig> and gs share  <dig>  thirteen of these genes are located in a  <dig> kb contig in p <dig>  homologous genes were identified in gs on several small contigs. synteny analysis of this chromosomal region in the wb genome indicates that a rearrangement has occurred when compared to p <dig>  preliminary data indicates that this region may also be absent from other giardia assemblage a isolates. one of the genes only present in p <dig> and gs  contains domains similar to a prokaryotic dna segregation protein and a second contains a possible nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain. however, the function of these proteins remains unknown. we detected the presence of  <dig> candidate pseudogenes in the giardia genomes,  <dig> that were detected in wb and  <dig> in gs . all of these are members of common gene families and all but one have positional orthologs in the gs-p <dig> and p15-wb genome comparisons, respectively. the remaining  <dig> pseudogenes were identified in p <dig>  candidate pseudogenes in wb and p <dig> were confirmed to have disrupted coding sequences by sequencing of pcr products . sage-tags were not detected for wb pseudogenes, but could be detected for some wb orthologs to the confirmed pseudogenes in p <dig> and putative pseudogenes in gs . one pseudogene in p <dig> involves a lateral transfer candidate . intact orthologs are present in the human associated g. intestinalis wb and gs stains, and only four bacterial strains from three different groups. thus, the gene has a very patchy phylogenetic distribution in the tree of life. some of the bacteria that do encode the gene are associated with mammals; collinsella aerofaciens is part of the normal gut flora in humans, and ruminooccus inhabit the rumen of cattle.

small rnas and regulation of gene expression
the prediction of transfer rnas  was performed using trnascan-se  <cit> . the wb genome contains  <dig> trna genes, two of which were predicted to be pseudogenes  <cit> . in p <dig>   <dig> trna genes were predicted and  <dig> of them contained an intron. in contrast,  <dig> trnas were identified in the gs genome and  <dig> of these contained an intron. the three genomes contain the same complement of trna genes but the copy number of each gene can be variable.

the same four introns were identified in the giardia wb and gs genomes  <cit>  and introns were found in the same positions in the p <dig> genome. regular expressions constructed from consensus sequences of all known giardia introns failed to locate additional candidates. the encystation inducible promoters from p <dig> resemble those of wb. binding sites for the transcription factor myb <dig> can be identified in the equivalent positions in the promoters of the cyst wall protein- <dig>  cyst wall protein- <dig> and myb <dig> itself. p <dig> harbors myb <dig> binding sites in the sugar synthesis genes glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase and udp-glucose 4-epimerase as in wb, a distinguishing feature that is missing in the gs isolate.

non-coding rnas are generally well conserved, with p15-wb pairs showing the greatest similarity .

variable giardia gene families
outside the core gene set, four highly variable gene families, the variant-specific surface proteins , nek kinases, protein  <dig>  and high cysteine membrane proteins  predominate. the giardia genomes analyzed so far contain approximately  <dig> each of the vsp and nek kinase genes. vsps are the main parasite antigen in giardia and these proteins have a conserved membrane spanning domain with an invariant cytoplasmic tail and a cysteine rich variable domain that is exposed to the extracellular environment. the nek kinases belong to the nima-related  clade of serine/threonine kinases. surprisingly, 76% of the nek kinases in the giardia wb genome are predicted to be catalytically inert.

we identified  <dig> complete vsp genes in the p <dig> genome assembly. however, there is also a significant number of vsp sequences that are present in small contigs in spite of the high coverage and relatively long read lengths. the average identity of vsps between p <dig> and gs is 61% Â±  <dig> which is slightly higher than for wb and gs. a search for the conserved terminal crgka motif in all the reads gave  <dig> hits. with an average sequence coverage of 47Ã— we estimated the number of vsp genes to be approximately  <dig>  which is slightly lower than the number of annotated vsp genes. the reason could be incorrectly annotated vsp genes in shorter redundant contigs or possibly local variation in sequence depth. when we corrected for this, the vsp content is still lower in p <dig> compared to both wb and gs. vsp genes are rarely located in syntenic position in the genomes. this shows the plasticity of vsp genes both from the sequence perspective and from genomic location. the vsps in p <dig> appear to be scattered throughout the genome as in wb and gs. regions where vsps and other dynamic protein families are found are characterized by significant differences in codon usage and higher g + c content. these regions are also frequently associated with breaks in synteny and rearrangements. the only regulatory motif that is uniquely associated with vsp genes in wb and p <dig> is the extended polyadenylation signal. this motif is remarkably well conserved over a stretch of  <dig> nucleotides  and is invariably located 0- <dig> bp downstream from the stop codon of vsp genes. subtle differences in the consensus sequences can be distinguished between the isolates . this sequence is also found in the small subset of vsp genes available from the gs isolate. motif searches conducted on sequences upstream of the vsp genes revealed very few conserved sequences.

phylogenetic analysis of vsp genes from p <dig> and wb was conducted using protein sequence alignment and maximum likelihood. the analysis indicated that vsp genes are distributed in two major subgroups in this tree which we designate as a and b, based on their distance in the phylogenetic tree . the b subgroup is considerably smaller than the a subgroup but both subgroups contain both p <dig> and wb sequences. certain branches of each subgroup show enrichment of either p <dig> or wb vsps, which could reflect recent vsp duplication events. it is not clear whether the enrichment of wb genes is due a possible lack of assembled sequences for p <dig> or if this actually represents lineage specific diversification.

structural variation in giardia genomes
structural variation analyzed across the three giardia genomes revealed frequent loss of genome synteny. in total,  <dig> cases of insertions, deletions and rearrangements could be detected. in most cases, the exact type of rearrangement could not be determined due to the termination of contigs in p <dig> and gs and occasionally in wb. only  <dig> synteny breaks were recorded between wb and gs in contrast to  <dig> instances in the phylogenetically more related wb and p <dig>  this discrepancy can be explained by the more fragmented gs draft assembly in which very few genes from repetitive gene families could be assembled. the deep coverage and overall quality of the p <dig> assembly increases the amount of structural variants that can be detected. we investigated the quality of our assembly by pcr verification of  <dig> structural variants . this set included predicted intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements involving all chromosomes except chromosome  <dig>  seven out of  <dig> synteny breaks yielded the expected pcr product, including potential inter-chromosomal rearrangements between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as well as  <dig> and  <dig>  intra-chromosomal events were verified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the percentage of verified synteny breaks is higher in the p <dig> assembly  than what was found experimentally in the gs draft genome   <cit> .

genes found in non-syntenic regions of the genomes were categorized according to annotation and the number of genes in each category were compared for wb and p <dig> . hypothetical proteins was the most common category  followed by vsps . protein  <dig> , hcmps, nek kinases and putative transposable elements were also found to be associated with synteny breaks in these giardia genomes. large fractions of genes belonging to these gene families have diverged significantly, indicating that these gene families evolve more rapidly than other genes. genes for gtp-binding protein and reverse transcriptase were more commonly associated with synteny breaks in p <dig> whereas kinases were found more often in wb. retro-transpososon associated sequences such as reverse transcriptases or endonucleases are found  <dig> times in  <dig> distinct non-syntenic positions in p <dig>  and wb .

indications of the highly variable genome structure in giardia have been noted previously in several reports  <cit> . subtelomeric regions containing ribosomal dna repeats are prone to rearrangements and copy number variation whereas the central region of chromosomes appear to be comparatively stable. the giardia rearrangement rate of rdna gene clusters has been estimated to be 1% per cell division in vitro  <cit> . differences in chromosome number of individual giardia nuclei have been reported for in vitro cultivated isolates. five distinct chromosomal linkage groups have been demonstrated in spite of the karyotype diversity seen in giardia. the karyotype heterogeneity could result from recombination associated with the presence of mobile elements. the wb genome contains three families of retrotransposons, two of which are located at the telomeres and could still be active  <cit> .

vsps were frequently found in non-syntenic positions in wb and p <dig>  genome rearrangements have been identified as crucial components in the generation of antigenic variation in other parasites. the mobile nature of vsps observed here is likely to be involved in generating vsp diversity through gene duplication and recombination. the large-scale architecture of giardia chromosomes seem to consist of gene rich regions displaying stable codon usage and conserved gene order interspersed by chromosomal locations with atypical codon usage . vsps and hcmp genes contribute to create such chromosomal islands with higher than average g + c content and atypical nucleotide signatures.

several smaller rearrangements were found in areas with well-conserved genes. these include insertion or deletion of individual or multiple genes, inversions and translocations .

discussion
we have previously reported a draft genome sequence and analysis of the giardia assemblage b isolate gs  <cit> . we here describe the first genome analysis of a non-human giardia isolate, that of assemblage e isolate p <dig>  we have chosen to use a high throughput strategy to sequence the genome of p <dig>  taking advantage of the low cost of  <dig> sequencing and the rapid data generation. we have examined the genetic diversity of a mostly uncharacterized assemblage of giardia, and identified intraspecific variation that can be used for population studies or genotyping in a clinical setting. comparative genome analysis of the assemblage a isolate wb and the b isolate gs previously revealed evidence of chromosomal shuffling, an abundance of allelic heterozygosity  and approximately  <dig> conserved open reading frames that were left unannotated in the first giardia genome project.

we have estimated the core gene content of giardia to be approximately 91% of the total gene content, with the remaining 9% involved in antigenic variation and functions related to host specificity. a few members of the vsp and hcmp families were found to be positionally conserved between all three genomes, but the function of these syntenic surface proteins is not known. the giardia genomes are relatively similar in terms of core gene content, but tend to differ with respect to synteny and in genes responsible for antigenicity. we have identified several small scale genomic changes, including insertions and deletions of coding and noncoding sequences. a small number of isolate specific genes were identified and in most cases these are located in nonsyntenic regions of the genome. as expected, the giardia isolates have diverged repertoires of surface proteins  primarily coded in nonsyntenic regions of the genomes. a similar genomic arrangement is present in the trypanosomes where syntenic regions are interspersed with large regions of surface molecule genes, noncoding sequences and repeats. the roles of such regions are unknown but could constitute regions of increased genomic plasticity and they could play a role in the generation of antigenic variation through recombination events. a chromosome-wide analysis of gene order have been hindered in our assembly by the lack of long range continuity, a result of the sequencing read length. future efforts to characterize the giardia spp. genomes would benefit from using paired-end libraries or other strategies to join repeated regions and to avoid the typical homopolymer errors associated with the  <dig> technology.

a very low level of allelic sequence heterozygosity was detected in the p <dig> genome, which contradicts findings in the gs genome, but is consistent with observations from the wb genome. the striking differences in ash levels could imply different biology regarding sexual reproduction, gs could be a recent mixture of two isolates, or the presence of active meiotic components in either isolate. it has been suggested that the assemblage a isolates may have a mechanism to maintain low levels of ash, and that such a mechanism could also be operating in some assemblage e isolates. however, low ash levels in p <dig> does conflict with genotyping data from assemblage e isolates where double peaked chromatograms have been observed  <cit> . low ash may be a feature of this particular assemblage e isolate but the high abundance of double peaks from other isolates could also reflect the fact that mixed infections with different assemblage e subgenotypes are more frequent in animals. further studies of additional assemblage e isolates are needed to resolve this issue. several genes identified as involved in dna repair and meiosis in giardia, were previously shown to display larger than average sequence divergence as well as insertions and deletions in the gs isolate, compared to wb  <cit> . an analogous comparison with the p <dig> isolate reveals substantial divergence in the genes rad <dig>  rad <dig> and mre <dig>  and gs specific insertions in smc <dig>  mlh <dig>  rad <dig> and deletions in rad <dig>  msh <dig>  dmc1a and smc <dig> that are specific for the ash-rich gs lineage. only one insertion in rad <dig> was specific for the wb lineage whereas none were detected in p <dig>  however, it should also be noted that genes displaying a high degree of divergence in the gs lineage are also the most diverged when comparing wb and p <dig>  future studies of these differences correlated to the level of ash in disparate isolates could reveal a mechanism for dealing with ash accumulation. these differences in gene synteny and ash between these three giardia isolates suggest that there is ubiquitous inter-genotype genetic diversity.

indels have previously been noted as a prominent feature of many giardia proteins when compared to eukaryotic homologs. small indels are an abundant feature in pairwise comparisons between all three genomes and they are dispersed over a major fraction of the genes. in contrast to single nucleotide polymorphisms , indels always alter the primary amino acid sequence, and are therefore more likely to impact protein function. we found that a number of genes involved in core processes of the cell have indels, which could possibly alter the functional specificity or efficiency of these proteins. indels have been described in other species and have been attributed to dna polymerase slippage  <cit> .

several groups encompassing metabolic genes were found to have elevated dn/ds ratios . such changes could cause substrate specificity to change in enzymes or alter metabolic pathways. it is possible that these enzymes allow variation in the amino acid sequence without affecting protein function. another possibility is that these enzymes evolve more rapidly due to adaptations to the intestinal microenvironment in the host organism. a similar differential pattern of dn/ds rate was observed for genes grouped according to developmental stage. we here observed that genes expressed in certain developmental stages have slightly different distributions of dn/ds values . the reason for this could be that certain stages need to be more tightly regulated and cannot easily accommodate variation. another possibility would be that some stages expose proteins to the external environment, which could cause selective constraints by the host immune system.

we found evidence for a highly conserved set of core genes in giardia which we propose is essentially common to all giardia intestinalis isolates. this set of genes lies in genomic regions with mostly conserved synteny. despite this, polymorphisms in terms of synonymous and nonsynonymous snps and indels are common in this set of genes, which could change the function or specificity of the expressed proteins. also, cases of disrupted synteny do occur in these regions, which indicate that chromosomal recombination takes place in giardia or in certain lineages of the species. experimental evidence for recombination between assemblages is missing, but has been reported to occur between a <dig> isolates  <cit> .

a large fraction of genes in the diplomonad genome have been proposed to have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer, due to their clustering with bacterial sequences in phylogenetic trees  <cit> . here we found a number of genes only present in certain isolates . some of these genes could be involved in shaping phenotypic differences, whereas others could be non-functional remnants from recent horizontal gene transfers, or represent recent losses in one or two of the lineages. an example of a recently acquired gene is the acetyl transferase gene with an apparent bacterial origin which was identified in p <dig>  but which is absent in wb and gs . however, it is presently unknown if the gene is expressed and what the precise function of its putative product might be. our gene content comparison  showed that gene acquisition and loss is much less frequent than in intestinal bacteria, such as escherichia coli  <cit> . nevertheless, it indicates that gene acquisition is an extant evolutionary process also in a eukaryotic parasite, which likely contributes to diversification of giardia isolates over evolutionary timescales.

the dynamics of the g. intestinalis genomes are further exemplified by a putative pseudogene found in a conserved core region of assemblage e. evolutionary analyses revealed that the gene most likely was recently acquired from bacteria, probably of the mammalian gut flora . the gene then turned into a pseudogene in p <dig>  whereas it is under purifying selection in wb and gs. the presence of this gene exclusively in the human infecting isolates is intriguing; it is tempting to speculate that it might be related to host specificity.

we could not find any clear evidence for chromosomal duplications in our genome data, but we detected the presence of a genomic region in p <dig> that harbors  <dig> genes that are absent in wb while it appears that they are present in gs. a preliminary analysis suggests that this region may be absent from other assemblage a isolates as well, and the protein products from these genes could constitute good targets for the development of assemblage discriminating antibodies for serological purposes. host specificity or phenotypic variation could also manifest at the level of expression. differential expression of genes between isolates could provide means for creating host specificity and phenotypic differences. the regulation of gene expression is likely to be mostly post-transcriptional because of the short relaxed promoters in giardia, and it is possible that short rnas could be involved. future efforts to characterize the giardia transcriptome would benefit from using high throughput sequencing to efficiently enhance the resolution and confirm the expression of proposed gene models.

the repeat content of the giardia genome is approximately 9% depending on which gene families are taken into consideration. this can be compared to the 50% repeat content of another protozoan parasite, t. cruzi  <cit> . the relatively low complexity of the giardia genome makes it ideal for rapid comparative genomics using shotgun sequencing.

repeated areas in the giardia genome contain pseudogenes, retro-transposons and low complexity repeats and they could constitute areas of increased genomic plasticity or sites where recombination occurs, which is indicated by their associations with discontinued synteny. proteins that are encoded in these regions have no positional orthologs in other genomes but tend to be classified into one of the larger gene families in giardia. in other genomes with short intergenic distances, gene order has mostly been conserved. also, the bidirectional promoters of giardia could act to prevent reshuffling by inactivating genes upon rearrangement. whether genomic rearrangements occur randomly, or in a controlled manner by a certain mechanism or genomic location, warrant further investigation. it is known that co-regulated genes act as a hindrance to genomic rearrangements. it could therefore be proposed that the lack of gene regulation at the transcriptional level allows for larger genomic rearrangements in giardia without affecting gene function. the presence of retro-transposon derived sequences in non-syntenic genomic positions in wb and p <dig> could indicate retro-transposons have contributed to shaping the giardia genomes by increasing the genomic plasticity.

the giardia genomes contain a very large fraction of hypothetical genes that code for proteins of unknown function and with limited expression or proteomic data to support their expression or function. most of these genes appear to be randomly distributed across the genome. the lack of significant hits to other protozoan genomes likely reflects the strong adaptation of the parasite to its host environment in combination with the evolutionary divergence of these organisms. as the number of sequences from diplomonads increases, due to a number of ongoing diplomonad sequencing projects, several giardia proteins will likely be assigned orthologs, but experimental efforts will be required to elucidate the function of these proteins. the generation of the gs and p <dig> draft genomes have provided information about the strong conservation of these genes which indicates that they have a functional role in giardia biology.

it is clear that the genomic data alone cannot resolve the question of host specificity and mechanisms of pathogenicity, but the genome sequence data provide an evolutionary insight into how parasite genomes have been shaped over the course of evolution. moreover, the identification of lineage specific genes and gene variants will provide candidates for future functional studies. we hope that the draft genome sequence of this assemblage e isolate will provide useful information for future studies of the differences between giardia strains and the diplomonads in general.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that there is extensive genetic variation between giardia intestinalis lineages. this includes chromosomal recombination, single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion-deletion events. the assemblages contain diverged repertoires of giardia surface proteins and other gene families, including vsps, hcmps, protein  <dig>  and nek kinases, including hundreds of distinct proteins for each of the three sequenced giardia genomes. the analysis of orthologs indicate a stable set of core genes, present in all of the examined assemblages, and only a small number of isolate specific genes have been identified. certain categories of genes were found to be under a differential evolutionary rate. however, for a complete understanding of the genomic landscape of giardia it would be useful to combine data from more than one sequencing platform to understand the chromosome-wide differences.
