BACKGROUND
cell lines combining high-production and stability are important for recombinant protein production, notably of therapeutic antibodies. these antibodies are chiefly produced in chinese hamster ovary  cells which combine several advantageous qualities, notably that these antibodies are compatible with humans and bioactive therein  <cit> . however, the development of high-producing recombinant cell lines in cho cells is laborious as well as cost-intensive. from the delivery of the recombinant dna into the host cell nucleus for chromosomal integration, to several rounds of screening and selection of high-producing clones, and until commercial manufacturing can take many months. more importantly, such high-producing cell line subclones often manifest heterogeneous expression patterns or lose expression of the recombinant protein during a long-term culture. thus, loss of productivity is a chronic problem which reflects the operation of multiple causes . nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying subclonal variations and genomic instability are still not well understood. processes known to contribute to overall recombinant protein production stability include transcription, translation, protein folding, and protein secretion. hence, a wide range of strategies encompassing practically all aspects of cell line development and cultivation in recombinant protein production in cho cells is used to mitigate this problem  <cit> .

chromatin is a complex nucleoprotein structure in which the dna is packaged in the cell nucleus. at the chromatin level, different epigenetic events operate that can affect the integration sites of the protein-expression vector into the cho genome. thus, epigenetic events may contribute to the transcriptional repression of the transgene  <cit> . the known epigenetic effectors include dna methylation, nucleosome positioning, histone variants, histone modifications, and non-coding rnas. these could function independently or combinatorially to affect recombinant mrna and ipso facto protein expression  <cit> . thus for example, a modification by dna methylation through the addition of a methyl group to the c <dig> carbon residue of cytosines in the c-g dinucleotide  in the promoter region driving the transgene can effect silencing in several ways. transcriptional repression by dna methylation may result through occlusion of transcriptional activator binding to target dna or recruitment of methyl-cpg-binding domain  proteins  <cit> . these mbd proteins recruit modifying and chromatin-remodelling complexes to methylated sites. dna methylation may also contribute to inhibition of gene expression by promoting a more compact and rigid nucleosome structure  <cit> . moreover, dna methylation in other regions such as gene bodies may also play a role, but so far the precise mechanisms in modulating transcription have yet to be defined  <cit> .

a transgene in the cho genome can also be influenced by the positioning of the nucleosome at the integration site. the nucleosome is the fundamental repeating chromatin subunit comprised of eight histones encompassed by circa 147 bp of dna in  <dig>  superhelical turns. the histone octamer itself comprises two copies each of histones h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  nucleosome positioning is key to higher-order chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation . nucleosomes modulate the accessibility of dna to regulatory proteins and transcriptional machinery to control gene activation or repression. several factors can affect nucleosome positioning. these include dna sequence preferences, dna methylation status, histone variants, and histone post-translational modifications  <cit> . replacement of nucleosomal histones with histone variants can influence nucleosome positioning, and thus gene activity  <cit> . moreover, a number of post-translational modifications  of amino-acid residues in the n-terminals of histones  can affect the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure and gene function  <cit> . these ptms such as acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation, can determine chromatin state by directly influencing structure or serve as signals to readers of histone modifications  <cit> .

a number of studies have shown that aberrant dna methylation  <cit>  and histone h <dig> hypoacetylation  <cit>  exacerbate productivity losses in monoclonal antibody-producing cho cell lines. such concerns prompted our current aim to measure the impact of epigenetic silencing mechanisms on promoting clonal heterogeneity during cell line development and protein production after long-term culture. we investigated dna methylation and used a variety of approaches to interrogate the chromatin environment around the human eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha  <dig>  promoter sequence in four recombinant cho cell lines which exhibited loss of productivity during long-term culture. we found each cell line exhibited chromatin marks highly associated with recombinant mrna expression. understanding chromatin environment in recombinant cho cell lines should help facilitate selection of stable and productive cell lines for recombinant protein production.

RESULTS
characteristic features of the pt1-cho cell lines
in this study, we investigated four pt1-cho cell lines which exhibited attenuated recombinant protein production after a long-term culture . these cell lines were developed for antibody production by transfecting cho-k <dig> cells with a plasmid-expression-vector construct  carrying cdna encoding heavy and light chains of a murine igg2a antibody. as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis, integration sites of the transgene may involve different chromosome regions and chromosomes . for instance, fish performed on short-term cultures  showed a centromeric integration site for pt1- <dig>  while a telomeric one for pt1- <dig>  fish signals for pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> were observed in one of the smaller chromosomes of cho-k <dig>  in particular, pt1- <dig> was integrated in z <dig> at chromosome band p <dig> fig.  <dig> cytogenetic characterization of pt1-cho cell lines. a fish analysis showing the different integration sites of the pt <dig> expression vector in the cho-k <dig> genome. a centromeric integration site can be seen for pt1- <dig>  and telomeric for pt1- <dig>  fish was performed on early passage  recombinant pt1-cho cell lines. preparations were counterstained with dapi . reverse dapi conversions were performed to render latent g-banding images visible. vector dnas depicted were labelled by nick translation with red emission dy-590-dutp , or green emission dy- <dig>  b chromosome number  ranged from  <dig> to 98 % as determined in  <dig> metaphases at passage p <dig> 



the modal chromosome number  determined at high passage  in these pt1-cho cell lines was found in 84–98 % in  <dig> analyzed metaphases . we also assessed additional indicators of genomic instability at two time points  such as chromatin abnormalities ; micronuclei  and nuclear bud formation ; as well as chromosome lagging and chromatin bridges at anaphase and telophase . mean mn frequency ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  %; nbuds  <dig> – <dig>  %; and premature chromatin condensation  <dig> – <dig>  % as determined in  <dig> cells per analysis. mean frequencies of mitotic aberrations ranged from  <dig> to 36 % in  <dig> ana/telophases per analysis. overall, the pt1- <dig> cell line exhibited the highest frequencies in the indicators of genomic instability used .fig.  <dig> determination of genomic instability in the pt1-cho cell lines. a examples of chromosomal and chromatin abnormalities observed after dapi-staining. shown are those seen from pt1-30; indicated by arrow:  chromatin bridges at anaphase;  a lagging chromosome at late anaphase;  a micronucleus at telophase;  a micronucleus beside a smaller one;  nuclear buds;  chromatin condensation/fragmentation. b frequencies of micronuclei, nuclear buds, chromatin condensation and ana/telophase abnormalities, showing higher frequencies for pt1- <dig> than the other three cell lines. one-way anova tests for micronucleus formation , and ana/telophase abnormalities  were found significant. cells were grown in 1-well chamber slides. the frequencies for micronucleus, nuclear bud, and chromatin condensation/fragmentation were determined from n =  <dig> cells. the frequency for abnormal mitotic stages were determined in n =  <dig> ana/telophases. data represent means and standard error of the means  of measurements of two passages .



in addition, using a pair of primers specific to the light chain cdna sequence on the pt <dig> construct, the copy numbers of integrated transgenes were determined by qpcr. pt1- <dig>  with a copy number of  <dig> determined previously by southern blot hybridization, served as a calibrator. the copy number of integrated transgenes ranged from about  <dig> – <dig> copies, with pt1- <dig> exhibiting the highest copy number . moreover, the pt1-cho cell lines differed in the degree or the loss thereof of recombinant protein expression during stability studies over  <dig> passages . pt1- <dig> was the least productive, whereas pt1- <dig> showed the most stable expression. although cultivated under selection pressure , all four cell lines exhibited loss of productivity during long-term culture. nevertheless, since two of the pt1-cho clones with transgene copy number of about  <dig> still showed productivity after  <dig> passages , we presumed that loss of copy number could not be the sole reason for the loss of productivity. in other words, if the loss of productivity was due to a loss in transgene copy number, these clones would exhibit zero copy, which in turn implies null productivity.fig.  <dig> transgene copy number and stability study in recombinant pt1-cho cell lines. a copy number of integrated transgenes was determined by quantitative pcr  using primers on the light chain cdna of pt <dig> construct at an early passage . pt1- <dig> was used as a calibrator with a known copy number of one which was previously determined by southern blot hybridization . samples were measured in triplicates. pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> revealed more than one copy of the transgene. data represent means and standard error of the means  of n =  <dig> measurements. b a stability study was initiated with a relative value of  <dig> as a starting titer value. during the study, all clones showed instability to various degrees. in the most unstable clone pt1- <dig>  a drop of productivity to  <dig>  was measured whereas pt1- <dig> showed a loss of titer to only  <dig> .



recombinant mrna expression
because the loss of recombinant protein expression in the pt1-cho cell lines could primarily reflect the loss of recombinant mrna expression, we measured the mrna expression of each cell line by qrt-pcr in various passages  throughout the study. we designed pcr primers along the sequences encoding the heavy and light chains contained in the plasmid-expression-vector construct , carried out qrt-pcr for heavy and light chains using mrna isolated from different time points and quantified recombinant mrna expression of each  . we found significant differences in recombinant mrna among the pt1-cho cell lines either on the basis of heavy chain, light chain, or percentage heavy/light chain . a difference with respect to light chain expression due to time point of measurements was also detected , but not for the heavy chain. overall, the highest expression was obtained for pt1- <dig>  then pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig>  the lowest for pt1- <dig>  and this relationship remained essentially constant, even in a total of n =  <dig> mrna expression measurements . we can deduce from this result that the poor protein productivity for pt1- <dig> was associated with the negligible recombinant mrna expression of this subclone.fig.  <dig> recombinant mrna expression in four different pt1-cho cell lines: a as measured by qrt-pcr using heavy chain  and light chain  primers; and b as the percentage of hc/lc qrt-pcr values. qrt-pcr results were obtained by absolute quantification standard curve method and given as the average of n =  <dig> independent time point measurements done at several passages . two-way anova was significant ; mann – whitney u test  for pt1- <dig> vs. pt1- <dig>  pt1- <dig>  or pt1-55) was also significant . data represent means and standard error of the means  of n =  <dig> independent measurements.



dna methylation
to determine whether dna methylation impacts long-term gene-silencing in pt1-cho cell lines, we next interrogated the human eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha  <dig>  promoter contained in the pt <dig> expression vector. using bioinformatic tools , we annotated the 1261-bp eef1a <dig> promoter and identified two cpg islands in the promoter region . we designed pcr primers to analyze by bisulfite sequencing a 231-bp fragment encompassing  <dig> cpg sites on the cpg island nearest the transcription start site  in the pt1-cho cell lines . specifically, to perform dna methylation analysis, we bisulfite-treated the total genomic dna isolated from the pt1-cho cell lines converting unmethylated cytosines into uracil, while methylated cytosines remain unchanged. during pcr amplification, uracils are read by dna polymerase as thymine. methylation state can then be determined by sequencing of the pcr product from bisulfite-modified dna in comparison with the original sequence. direct sequencing of amplified pcr fragments from genomic dna isolated at high passage  revealed low methylation in the analyzed  <dig> cpg sites of the eef1a <dig> promoter region in the four pt1-cho cell lines . cloning of the pcr fragments and sequencing of clones to enable analysis of single molecules also confirmed low methylation, i.e. highest was  <dig>  % found in pt1- <dig> .

in contrast, we obtained different results when we compared the methylation patterns in the cell lines pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> at low passage , but with reduced fcs  in the culture medium. thus, we observed higher methylation with  <dig>  % fcs than 10 % fcs , where several cpgs exhibited more than 50 % methylation level after direct bisulfite sequencing . to verify whether cpg methylation was indeed solely due to the fcs concentration rather than passage number, we investigated the eef1a <dig> promoter region in a different vector in cho cells at low  and high passage  at 10 % fcs, and under adherent culture conditions. unlike the pt <dig> expression vector in which there are three copies of the eef1a <dig> promoter, there is only one promoter copy in the vt <dig> vector . under these conditions, we observed more cpg methylation in vt2-cho cell lines at late than at early passage . altogether, these results imply plasticity of epigenetic responses owing to different culture environments.fig.  <dig> dna methylation analysis along the eef1a <dig> promoter region at low passage  but different fcs concentration 10 %   vs.  <dig>  % fcs  for cell lines pt1- <dig> vs. pt1- <dig>  methylated cpgs , unmethylated cpgs . 



single-molecule chromatin mapping
since our data discounted a major role for dna methylation in the repression of recombinant mrna in the four pt1-cho cell lines, we turned to investigating the possible contribution of the chromatin environment. we used a single-molecule footprinting strategy that reveals chromatin structure after treating nuclei with bacterial cpg-specific dna methyltransferase  and subsequent bisulfite sequencing of individual progeny dna molecules . essentially, cpgs are methylated by m.sssi unless the cpgs are blocked  by nucleosomes or dna-binding proteins. specific footprints can then be revealed contingent upon nucleosome positions and transcription factor binding sites on promoters . in this regard, nucleosome localization is defined as a region of about 147-bp inaccessible to m.sssi.fig.  <dig> single-molecule chromatin mapping with the cpg-specific dna methyltransferase m.sssi on the eef1a <dig> promoter in pt1-cho cell lines. a schematic annotation of a predicted nucleosome  with putative transcription factor binding sites , and cpgs . below panels are representative m.sssi maps and interpretation obtained in pt1- <dig>  methylated ; unmethylated ; white squares are missing or unclear values. b the analyzed nucleosomes nearest the tss and m.sssi maps showing more protected cpgs in pt1- <dig> than in pt1- <dig> 



to facilitate correlation of m.sssi chromatin maps to recombinant mrna expression in the pt1-cho lines, we first predicted nucleosome positions and putative transcription factor binding sites along the eef1a <dig> promoter using bioinformatic tools . for prediction, we used the 1261-bp eef1a <dig> promoter sequences, and analyzed the two predicted nucleosomes towards and nearest the transcription start site . for ease of scoring, these two nucleosomes were arbitrarily designated nuc  <dig>  and nuc  <dig> . we next isolated chromatin from the pt1-cho cell lines at high passage , followed by a brief treatment with m.sssi and genomic dna isolation. subsequently, we undertook bisulfite sequencing of several clones from each cell line interrogating  <dig> cpg sites within two predicted nucleosomes nearest the tss, and the same sites earlier analyzed during dna methylation analysis. control estimates of the methylation efficiency of m.sssi on the eef1a <dig> promoter obtained from ‘naked’ genomic dna of two pt1-cho cell lines yielded average levels of 98 % .

initially, we undertook m.sssi chromatin mapping with pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> whose results already implied a correlation with recombinant mrna expression, recalling that recombinant mrna expression was higher in pt1- <dig> than pt1- <dig>  indeed, the m.sssi chromatin maps showed higher nucleosome occupancy  in pt1- <dig> than in pt1- <dig> . these initial findings were confirmed after m.sssi mapping involving all the four pt1-cho cell lines which showed that nucleosome occupancy correlated well with recombinant mrna expression . the occupancy of the nucleosome nearest the tss  appeared most predictive, with the least productive lines  garnering the highest scores. taken together, these results show tighter chromatin condition for pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> accompanying reduced mrna expression. on the other hand, an open chromatin condition for pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> partnered higher expression. nonetheless, nucleosome occupancy ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % in these pt1-cho cell lines which had undergone long-term culture.

chromatin immunoprecipitation 
the encouraging results obtained with single-molecule mapping with m.sssi, prompted further investigation of the role of chromatin structure along the eef1a <dig> promoter underlying recombinant mrna expression and eventually protein productivity in the pt1-cho cell lines. we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation , which is used to map proteins such as histones, transcription factors, and other chromatin-modifying complexes associated with specific regions of the genome. briefly, chromatin is isolated, fragmented, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to the protein or modification of interest. the purified chip-enriched dna is then analyzed by quantitative-pcr, microarray technology, or sequencing . specifically, we performed chip using native chromatin  fragmented by enzymatic digestion to nucleosomal resolution , and antibodies against a canonical histone , two histone variants  and four histone modifications . chip with normal rabbit igg was used as a control. in addition, we designed qpcr primers to amplify within the nucleosome core, borders, or fragments spanning the two nucleosomes described and analyzed earlier in the m.sssi chromatin mapping. we quantified the chip dna and input dna before performing qpcr, and then normalized results using percentage input relative to the canonical histone h2a. we then correlated the different chip enrichments in chromatin isolated at high passages  to the respective recombinant mrna expression of the four pt1-cho cell lines.

that a tight chromatin conformation was associated with repression of recombinant mrna expression or vice versa was confirmed by the chip results obtained with the canonical h2a antibody . specifically, we performed chip with h2a alone in all the four pt1-cho cell lines. h2a was included as control for histone quality in all subsequent chip experiments with histone variants and histone modifications. thus, there were a total of n =  <dig> chip experiments with h2a. chip-pcr was undertaken using the four primer pairs on two predicted nucleosome positions along the human eef1a <dig> promoter region. we thus showed significant differences in h2a enrichments  among the four cell lines . differences owing to the qpcr primer pair used  were not significant. notably, we observed higher h2a enrichments for pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> than pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig>  with pt1- <dig> garnering the highest while pt1- <dig> was the lowest . altogether, h2a enrichment negatively correlated with the recombinant mrna expression, consistent with the findings previously obtained with the m.sssi chromatin mapping.fig.  <dig> chromatin marks associated with recombinant mrna expression in pt1-cho cell lines. a chip with h2a indicating higher nucleosome occupancy correlating with lower recombinant mrna expression. results are presented as percentage input calculated from ct values, and the means and sem of n =  <dig> independent experiments involving four primer pairs along two predicted nucleosome positions in the eef1a <dig> promoter region. also shown are the qpcr values obtained in the four primer pairs for igg, which served as a control for the chip experiment. statistical significance  at p <  <dig> , unpaired t test, one-tailed. b h <dig>  and h3k9ac enrichments relative to h2a. c a summary of chip enrichments for all the analyzed histone variants  and histone modifications . data represent means and standard error of the means  of n =  <dig> independent experiments and in chromatin isolated at different passages .



chip enrichments of histone variants and histone modifications are given as percentage input dna and/or further normalized relative to the histone control h2a  in which results could vary, especially regarding histone modifications . the normalization with an invariant histone  is assumed to correct for differences in chip signals caused by differences in nucleosome density  <cit> . nonetheless, on the basis of chip enrichments relative to h2a, we found significant differences among the pt1-cho cell lines with respect to the histone variants  and the histone modifications . for instance, enrichments of h <dig>  and h3k9ac  were highly significant  and correlated positively with recombinant mrna expression . no significant differences were detected of enrichments owing to the chip-qpcr primers used . overall, the cell lines with the least recombinant mrna expression  also displayed the least chip enrichments or vice versa . furthermore, pt1- <dig> obtained the highest level for h3k27me <dig> . as for the cell lines with highest expression, pt1- <dig> displayed the highest enrichment for h2a.z, and pt1- <dig> for h3k9me <dig>  among the histone variants and modifications analyzed, there was a low level of h3k4me <dig> in all the pt1-cho cell lines.

formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements  analysis
the m.sssi mapping and chip with h2a suggested a more permissive chromatin, i.e. lesser nucleosome occupancy for pt1- <dig> than the other three pt1-cho cell lines, which was associated with higher recombinant mrna expression. to determine chromatin openness for pt1- <dig>  we adopted a strategy using faire  coupled with qpcr with the same primers used in chip experiments. faire identifies nucleosome-depleted regions; i.e. regions  bound by transcription factors or other regulatory proteins  <cit> . essentially, the technique involves crosslinking of chromatin with formaldehyde followed by sonication, phenol-chloroform extraction, and dna isolation. dna fragments recovered from the aqueous phase  are then analyzed by pcr, microarrays, or next-generation sequencing. we found significant differences among the pt1-cho cell lines concerning faire enrichment , but not on specific primers used. crucially, pt1- <dig> exhibited the highest faire-enrichment levels .fig.  <dig> faire-enrichment  showing highest in pt1- <dig> as measured by qpcr. the recovered fragments in the corresponding organic phase are also shown. primers used are given in table  <dig>  data represent means and standard error of the means  of n =  <dig> independent experiments and in chromatin isolated at different passages .



chromatin signatures in pt1-cho cell lines
multiple approaches, i.e. dna methylation analysis, single-molecule chromatin mapping with m.sssi, chip with different histones and faire on the eef1a <dig> promoter contained in the expression vector integrated in the cho genome revealed that each pt1-cho cell line displayed a specific epigenetic signature or chromatin marks predictive of recombinant mrna expression . for instance, the cell line  with the lowest recombinant mrna expression had the highest nucleosome occupancy and displayed the least enrichments of histone marks particularly those associated with active transcription. on the other hand, the cell line pt1- <dig> which showed the highest recombinant mrna expression also exhibited the highest faire enrichments, and the greatest histone modifications h3k9ac and h3k9me <dig> which mark active promoter regions. furthermore, cell line pt1- <dig> with the second highest recombinant mrna transcription exhibited the highest enrichments of the histone variants h <dig>  and h2a.z, and the histone modification h3k9ac. altogether, these results suggest that chromatin structure along the eef1a <dig> promoter region is predictive of recombinant mrna expression in the analyzed pt1-cho cell lines and culture conditions, and in turn might have contributed to the eventual loss of recombinant protein expression after long-term culture.table  <dig> summary of the different epigenetic results and correlation to recombinant mrna expression in the pt1-cho cell lines

discussion
epigenetic silencing of the recombinant gene can be listed among the prime causes leading to reduced recombinant protein production. thus, we analyzed epigenetic modifications affecting chromatin structure that are associated with decreases or loss of recombinant mrna expression during cell line development for recombinant protein production. using a variety of approaches, we investigated the dna methylation pattern and chromatin landscape around the human eef1a <dig> promoter sequence contained in the expression vector  used for antibody production, and which was integrated into the cho genome. we analyzed four pt1-cho cell lines which differed in the loss-of-protein expression seen after high passage  in adherent condition supplemented with 10 % fcs in the culture medium. we found that epigenetic signatures in the pt1-cho cell lines correlated highly with recombinant mrna expression. furthermore, the lowest-producing cell line exhibited chromatin marks suggestive of tight chromatin, while the highest-producing line showed marks associated with open chromatin. our results thus demonstrate that the mapping of chromatin structures can be useful in cho cell line development and metabolic engineering.

previous studies have shown that dna promoter hypermethylation can contribute to instability among recombinant cho cell lines. for instance, cpg sites within the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter/enhancer  are frequently methylated in unstable antibody-producing cho cell lines  <cit> . we also investigated the dna methylation pattern around the human eef1a <dig> promoter, but none of the pt1-cho cell lines under the condition of 10 % fcs and high passage exhibited significant increases in cpg methylation to suggest that dna methylation alone underlay reduced production. nonetheless, our results also implied culture-context-dependent methylation of the eef1a <dig> promoter. higher methylation became evident in the same cho cell line even at low passage if the fcs concentration of the culture medium was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig>  %. furthermore, when present in another vector construct, methylation along the eef1a <dig> promoter in cho cell lines was enhanced at higher passage numbers .

the chromatin mapping with the dna methyltransferase m.sssi  provided visualization of nucleosome occupancy on single eef1a <dig> promoter molecules, which correlated well with the recombinant mrna expression, i.e. higher nucleosome occupancy meant lower mrna expression. nonetheless, there was high nucleosome occupancy, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, in the pt1-cho cell lines which had undergone long-term culture. recently, a similar approach of nucleosome mapping in yeast pho <dig> promoter with m.cvipi  in single cells revealed significant heterogeneity of nucleosome configurations within a population  <cit> . the cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlated with changes in gene expression. such underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning can contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression. thus, mapping of nucleosomes using dna methyltransferases could facilitate weeding out unstable cho cell clones early when screening for stable-expressing cell lines. nevertheless, proper analytical methods and controls must be observed when performing nucleosome mapping experiments especially in combination with next-generation technologies  <cit> .

histones form the protein core of chromatin around which dna is wrapped. various modifications to histones play a key role in epigenetic control of cellular activity  <cit> . histone modifications and crosstalk can dictate the structure of chromatin as well as its functions in transcription, replication, and dna repair. we performed chip assays on different histones  to elucidate their role in recombinant protein abatement in the pt1-cho cell lines. indeed, a critical role of acetylated histone h <dig>  in the stability of recombinant protein production has been shown previously  <cit> . the decline of recombinant antibody production during long-term culture was attributable to a 48–53 % decrease in recombinant mrna levels without significant loss of recombinant gene copies, but accompanied by an approximately 45 % decrease in h3ac. our chip results on the analyzed pt1-cho cell lines showed a strong correlation of histone enrichments with transcriptional and protein status. for instance, the level of h2a-nucleosome occupancy was found highly predictive of chromatin structure along the eef1a <dig> promoter in affecting recombinant mrna expression and productivity in the pt1-cho cell lines.

certain histone variants and histone post-translational modifications  have been considered variously as chromatin marks for transcriptional activation or repression. for example, the histone modification h3k4me <dig> is often associated with transcriptional activation  <cit> , and this ptm was not enriched in the pt1-cho cell lines analyzed after long-term cell culture. interestingly, the cell line pt1- <dig> which also showed high recombinant mrna transcription and the most stable protein expression, was marked by enrichments of positive chromatin marks: i.e. histone variants h2a.z, h <dig> , and the histone modification h3k9ac . deposition of h2a.z and h <dig>  onto nucleosomes is generally associated with active transcription  <cit> . nucleosomes containing double variants h2a.z and h <dig>  are found in ‘nucleosome-free’ regions of active promoters in human cells  <cit> . moreover, acetylation of specific lysine residues of h <dig>  in promoter regions also correlates with gene activation  <cit> .

a well-known ptm and a key determinant of complex chromatin states is the methylation of histone lysine residues. histone methylation  of lysine residues is catalyzed by set-domain containing proteins and plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, cell cycle, genome stability, and nuclear architecture . histone lysine methylation is a marker of both transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, depending on the residue methylated and the degree of methylation. for instance, methylation of h3k <dig> is associated with active chromatin, while methylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> are generally hallmarks of condensed chromatin, and thus involved in gene silencing  <cit> . but active and inactive chromatin marks can colocalize in bivalent domains associated with transcriptional repression such as in pluripotent embryonic stem  cells and restricted trophoblast stem  cells to poise differentiation genes before activation or to stably repress genes  <cit> . our chip results showed that pt1- <dig> and pt1- <dig> exhibited higher levels for h3k9me <dig> which may be explained by their integration sites within repetitive regions  in the cho genome as shown by fish. indeed, the enzymes  mediating the bulk of h3k <dig> trimethylation preferentially localize to pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres . similarly, pt1- <dig> had the highest h3k27me <dig> enrichments which may be also attributed to its centromeric integration. combined with emerging new technologies, the field of epigenetics will surely gain a prominent role in recombinant protein production. the advent of ‘omics’ coupled with next-generation technologies and the sequencing of the cho genome  <cit>  can lead to enormous progress towards insights and innovations in cho cell line development and metabolic engineering  <cit> . furthermore, a cho-specific microarray can now be used for the analysis of differential genome-wide cpg methylation after butyrate supplementation, which is known to enhance cell-specific productivities in cho cells  <cit> . at the same time, a tremendous amount of information is accumulating in the field of epigenetics, and on the mechanisms underlying chromatin structure and function  <cit> , e.g., the chromatin-based silencing mechanisms such as the polycomb system and heterochromatin formation  <cit> . furthermore, an array of approaches is available to understand epigenetic inheritance and to predict functional gene expression at the genome or single-cell level  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
after carrying out dna methylation analysis, followed by single-molecule chromatin mapping with m.sssi, chip with different histones and faire on the eef1a <dig> promoter contained in an expression vector integrated into the cho genome, we found that each pt1-cho cell line displayed a distinct epigenetic signature or chromatin marks indicative of recombinant mrna expression. altogether, these results suggest that the chromatin structure along the eef1a <dig> promoter region can be predictive of recombinant mrna expression in the pt1-cho cell lines analyzed and together with culture conditions might contribute to the eventual loss of recombinant protein expression after long-term culture. these findings provide insights on how unstable cho cell clones could be weeded out early in the generation process of stable-expressing cell clones and protein production might be better assured.
