BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors  are germline-encoded receptors that recognize microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns , either alone or in combination with co-receptors. besides regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, tlr signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, and tight regulation is crucial in order to prevent hyperinflammation  <cit> . immune signaling is regulated at multiple levels, and the release of extracellular domains of immune receptors such as cytokine receptors represents an important regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . similar negative regulation accounts for modulation of tlr function  <cit> , and soluble forms of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> have been recently described  <cit> . the release of these soluble proteins increases upon cell activation and they exert inhibitory activity on tlr signaling  <cit> . soluble forms of tlrs have been detected in pleural fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva, breast milk and plasma  <cit> .

timely knowledge of the etiology of inflammatory conditions is crucial. not only does it facilitate appropriate treatment, but also unnecessary interventions may be avoided. in light of the critical shortage of new antibiotics, reduction in antibiotic prescription is warranted.

the concept of measuring soluble pattern recognition receptors  for the diagnosis of infections has been previously proposed for the tlr4-coreceptor cd <dig>  <cit> . however, analysis of soluble tlrs have up till now only been used in the diagnostic workup of pleural effusion and intra-amniotic infections  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to gain more insight into the release of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in-vitro and to investigate the kinetics of monocytic tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression and plasma levels of their soluble counterparts during experimental endotoxemia . furthermore, we hypothesized that stlr <dig> and stlr <dig>  being soluble forms of receptors that play pivotal roles in pathogen recognition by cells of the innate immune system, are differentially released during various inflammatory diseases, with higher levels in inflammatory conditions of infectious origin. as such, we evaluated the ability of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> levels to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious inflammatory pathologies.

methods
in-vitro studies
peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated from buffy coats of healthy individuals after informed consent. briefly, pbmcs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using ficoll-paque plus  and collecting the white interphase. cells were washed twice in cold pbs and concentrations were adjusted to 5 ×  <dig> cells/ml in rpmi- <dig>  supplemented 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamicin . mononuclear cells  in a 100-μl volume were added to round-bottom 96-well plates  and incubated with either 100 μl of culture medium , or lps from e. coli o55:b <dig> , pam3cys  or heat-killed e. coli atcc  <dig> . after 24 hour incubation at 37°c, the supernatants were stored at -80°c until measurement of stlr <dig>  stlr <dig> and il- <dig> 

experimental human endotoxemia
this study was part of a larger endotoxin trial registered at the clinicaltrials.gov registry under the number nct <dig> which was approved by the local ethics committee of the radboud university medical center  <cit> . the  <dig> healthy male volunteers included in the present study provided written informed consent. briefly, subjects were prehydrated during 1 h before lps administration by infusion of  <dig>  l  <dig> % glucose/ <dig> % saline solution, followed by 150 ml/h starting at the time of lps administration until 6 h afterwards and 75 ml/h until the end of the experiment. us reference escherichia coli endotoxin  was administered as an intravenous bolus . edta anticoagulated blood was collected from an arterial line.

flow cytometry for membrane tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression
in order to determine expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  blood was collected in edta-containing vacutainers. the following directly conjugated mouse anti-human antibodies were used: tlr2: cd <dig> pe , tlr4: cd <dig> pe-cy <dig> , and cd <dig> ecd . isotype and fluorochrome matched controls from beckman coulter were used. cell buffer solution was used containing  <dig> % bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline and  <dig> % sodium azide. rabbit serum  for blocking was diluted to 20% with cell buffer solution. red blood cell lysis was performed using  <dig>  m ammonium chloride , freshly prepared. 1 ml of blood was mixed with 20 ml of nh4cl lysing solution and was left at room temperature for 10 minutes. after centrifuging for 5 minutes at 500 g the supernatant was discarded. the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of pbs and centrifuged again. after this washing step the cell pellet was resuspended in  <dig>  ml cell buffer solution.  <dig>  ml of this cell suspension was mixed with  <dig>  ml 20% rabbit serum and left at room temperature for 10 min. subsequently, cells were incubated with the appropriate antibody concentration mixture for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. after washing, samples were resuspended in  <dig>  ml cell buffer solution and analyzed on a beckman coulter fc <dig> flow cytometer . monocytes were gated in a side scatter vs. cd <dig> plot. fluorochrome matched isotype controls, non-stained samples, as well as cells incubated with only a secondary antibody, were used to set the photo multiplier detectors. the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression was analyzed within cd14+ monocytes.

biomarker study
plasma concentrations of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> were measured in healthy controls, and two groups of patients and compared to that of the most used inflammatory biomarker, c-reactive protein . edta anticoagulated blood from the various groups of patients was prospectively collected during planned laboratory blood assessment for clinical purposes, or was available from previous clinical studies, as indicated. plasma was obtained by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2000 g. the study has been carried out in the netherlands in accordance with the applicable rules concerning the review of research ethics committees and informed consent. inclusion and exclusion criteria for the inflammatory disorders are shown in table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the demographic characteristics of the healthy controls and the patients included.table  <dig>

cytokine and stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> measurement
stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> concentrations were measured by a commercial elisa kits  with a lower limit of detection of  <dig>  ng/ml and  <dig>  ng/ml, respectively. a commercial elisa  with a minimal detection level of  <dig>  pg/ml was used for the determination of interleukin - <dig> concentrations in supernatants. il- <dig>  tumor necrosis factor α, il-1ra and il- <dig> concentrations in plasma were determined using a luminex assay , with a sensitivity of 6 pg/ml, 20 pg/ml, 72 pg/ml and 6 pg/ml, respectively. crp concentrations were measured with a commercial elisa, with a lower detection limit of 5 mg/l . samples were diluted when appropriate.

statistical analysis
cytokine and stlr concentrations in the in-vitro and endotoxemia experiments are expressed as mean ± sem. for the assessment of correlations spearman correlation coefficient was calculated. the mann-whitney u-test was used for the comparison of two groups in the biomarker study. additionally, to correct for the potential influence of age and sex on the biomarker concentrations, we performed multiple linear regression analysis  with the biomarker of interest as dependent variable and age, sex and the assigned group  as independent variable. receiver operating characteristics  curve statistics were applied to calculate sensitivity and specificity. in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of biomarkers, logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the predicted probabilities, which were subsequently used for the generation of a roc curve. the method described by delong was used for comparing areas under roc curves   <cit> . all tests were two-sided, and p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. data were analyzed using graph pad prism  <dig>  and medcalc version  <dig> . <dig>  .

RESULTS

stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> release during human endotoxemia
stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> plasma concentrations displayed a distinct pattern after lps infusion . before lps administration, stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> levels were undetectable or low in all volunteers. stlr <dig>  tnfα, il- <dig> and il- <dig> concentrations increased after lps infusion and reached a peak concentration at 2 hours lps infusion; stlr <dig> and il-1ra peaked after 4 hours. the mean peak values  were 357 ± 94 ng/ml for stlr <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml for stlr <dig>  836 ± 288 pg/ml for tnfα, 926 ± 145 pg/ml for il- <dig>  90 ± 17 pg/ml for il- <dig>  and 26081 ± 2213 pg/ml for il-1ra, respectively. the auc of stlr <dig> showed no correlation with the aucs of stlr <dig> , il- <dig> , tnfα , il- <dig> , and il-1ra . however, stlr <dig> showed a strong positive correlation with tnfα , il- <dig> . stlr <dig> showed a trend towards a positive correlation with il-1ra , and a negative with il- <dig> , respectively.figure  <dig>

cell-surface expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> on monocytes varied extensively among the subjects without a clear pattern and did not correlate with stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> plasma levels .

circulating concentrations of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in various inflammatory diseases
figure  <dig> shows the circulating concentrations of crp, stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in various infectious and non-infections inflammatory diseases.  <dig> patients and  <dig> healthy volunteers were included. for determination of crp, samples of  <dig> patients and  <dig> healthy volunteers were analyzed. crp, stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> circulating concentrations were significantly higher in patients with infection compared with patients with non-infectious inflammation . after correction for age and sex, the presence of an infection was still positively associated with crp, stlr <dig> and stlr4: unstandardized coefficients  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  , respectively. age, but not sex, was also positively associated with the three biomarker concentrations. furthermore, compared with patients suffering from viral infections, patients with bacterial infections displayed higher concentrations of crp and stlr <dig>  but not stlr <dig> . multivariate analysis with correction for age and sex showed all three biomarkers to be independently associated with the presence of a bacterial infection. unstandardized coefficients for crp, stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  , respectively. neither sex, nor age proved to influence the concentrations of crp, sltr <dig> and stlr <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> are released in-vitro and in-vivo after challenge with microbial ligands such as lps. significantly elevated plasma concentrations of stlrs are present in the circulation during experimental human endotoxemia, and high circulating concentrations of stlr <dig> are found in patients with infections compared to patients with non-infectious inflammation, as well as in patients with bacterial infections compared with viral infections. however, the value of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> as additional diagnostic biomarkers is low as both new markers do not surpass crp in accuracy.

in addition to the release of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> from stimulated immune cells  <cit> , constitutive release of stlrs has been demonstrated in various biological fluids such as saliva, breast milk, and amniotic fluid  <cit> . in plasma, stlr <dig> represented by several polypeptides, has been found by others  <cit> , although the concentrations are low. to avoid both harmful or insufficient inflammatory responses, inhibition and activation of the immune system needs to be properly balanced. various negative regulators of tlrs have been described  <cit>  of which stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> constitute an important first-line negative regulatory mechanism  <cit> . stlr <dig> either interferes with cd14-mediated triggering of membrane-bound tlr <dig>  dimerizes with tlr <dig> on the cell surface, or competes with cellular tlr <dig> for microbial ligands  <cit> . the complex formed by stlr <dig> and md- <dig> probably blocks the interaction between membrane-bound tlr <dig> and its ligand  <cit> . the rapid elevation of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in plasma upon lps administrations, similar to that of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicates that this feedback mechanism is rapidly activated. consistent with our in-vitro data, the release of stlrs in to the circulation demonstrates that immune modulation mediated by tlrs is not limited to the stimulation of the corresponding receptor on the cell membrane of immune cells. since both stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> dampen inflammation by disrupting tlr-mediated pro-inflammatory responses  <cit> , it might be possible that the counter regulatory mechanisms mediated by stlrs extend to interference with endogenous tlr ligands. although the kinetics of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> concentrations parallel those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, quantitatively they appear to be differentially regulated. plasma stlr <dig> levels did not show any correlation with both il- <dig> and il-1ra and for stlr <dig>  a negative correlation with il- <dig> was found. interestingly, while in-vitro release of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> by immune cells is comparable, their in-vivo concentrations differ strongly, with much higher concentration in the circulation of stlr2: this suggests a much more rapid clearance of stlr <dig> from circulation. this may imply that these anti-inflammatory mechanisms are regulated at a different level and are potential complementary strategies to reduce inflammation.

in recent years, an important role for tlr signaling has been discovered in oncogenesis, particularly in inflammation-driven tumors  <cit> . although the relationship between cell-bound tlr <dig> and its release as a soluble form is not clear-cut, the observed higher concentrations of stlr <dig> in the  group of patients with an underlying malignancy may reflect the increased expression of tlr <dig> as seen in some forms of cancer  <cit> .

alternatively spliced tlr <dig> mrna encodes the soluble form of tlr <dig>  <cit> . as such, we did not expect a correlation between the membrane expression of tlr <dig> and circulating stlr <dig>  on the contrary, stlr <dig> results from posttranslational processing: endocytosis of cell surface receptor is followed by conversion into stlr <dig> intracellularly  <cit> . in previous monocyte stimulation experiments, membrane-bound tlr <dig> correlated negatively with supernatant stlr <dig>  <cit> . we did not observe the downregulation of cell surface tlr expression on monocytes of individuals during endotoxemia. possible explanations for this lack of correlation are that  monocytes are detected only in very low numbers at 2 hours after lps injection  <cit>  and this subpopulation may well have a different tlr expression than more active monocytes that have marginated at this time-point;  we only examined the expression of tlrs on monocytes , however, other circulating cell subsets such as neutrophils or platelets also express tlr <dig>  <cit> , all potentially contributing to the plasma concentrations of stlrs;  the soluble receptors are derived from an intracellular pool, not directly from the cell surface  <cit> ; and finally  besides being shed, membrane bound tlr is influenced by tlr trafficking between intracellular compartments and the cell membrane  <cit> .

an important aspect of this study is the possibility to use soluble tlrs as diagnostic markers. rapid and reliable differentiation of non-infectious inflammatory disorders from infections, and the classification of infections according to their microbiological etiology is essential for optimal treatment of these conditions. so far, only a small number of studies have been published on stlrs as diagnostic biomarkers. a few studies from the same group reported that intrauterine infections in pregnant women are characterized by elevated levels of stlr <dig>  stlr <dig>  stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in the amniotic fluid  <cit> , supporting the concept of stlr release during infections. we assessed the value of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> levels to discriminate between several inflammatory conditions. stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> were elevated in response to inflammatory insults and particularly stlr <dig> showed a good specificity to discriminate between an infection and a non-infectious inflammatory conditions such as gout, crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis or autoinflammatory syndromes. moreover, stlr <dig> concentrations show a high specificity for discriminating between bacterial and viral infections using high cut-off values, but sensitivity was low. we have to mention however that the overall discriminative value of stlr levels was not superior to that of crp in the relatively small group of patients assessed in this study future larger validation studies should demonstrate the overall value of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> levels for the diagnosis of infections and autoinflammatory diseases in relation to that of classic inflammatory markers. furthermore, besides stlrs, other soluble pattern recognition receptors such as the soluble mannose receptor that are shed during cell stimulation with β-glucans are also interesting candidates for new and potentially more specific diagnostic biomarkers  <cit> .

our study also has limitations. firstly, it included a relatively limited number of clinical conditions, and it is not possible to extrapolate our results to the entire panel of infectious or non-infectious inflammatory diseases. secondly, we studied groups of inflammatory conditions as a whole, rather than focusing on correlation with other clinical information or outcome.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is an important initial proof-of-principle report on the role of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> during a broad panel of human infections and autoinflammatory diseases. shedding of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> is not confined to stimulation of its corresponding cell surface receptor, but it is a broader effect upon stimulation of innate immune cells through pattern recognition receptors. we report the significant increase of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> both in experimental models of human endotoxemia, as well as in the circulation of patients with infections. this suggests an important role of soluble tlrs in the modulation of inflammation during infections and the potential to use these tests as diagnostic markers. therefore, larger validation studies in larger patient cohorts are warranted in order to be able to draw definitive conclusions regarding the diagnostic usefulness of stlr <dig> and stlr <dig> in human inflammatory diseases.
