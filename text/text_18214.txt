BACKGROUND
one of the results from genome sequencing projects, such as the human genome project, is to promote the development of structural genomics/proteomics endeavors which focus on the large-scale determination of protein structures and functions. the traditional cloning and expression approach is inadequate for such a daunting task, and high throughput  methods are clearly necessary  <cit> . an integrated robotic pipeline can streamline the complex experimental procedures and makes it possible to carry out gene cloning and protein expression for a large amount of targets in a timely and reproducible manner. some groups have developed the htp cloning method including the design of nested primers for pcr cloning  <cit> , while we have also developed an automated pipeline for recombinant protein expression, applying the gateway cloning/expression technology and a stepwise automation strategy on an integrated robotic platform  <cit> . the robotic pipeline is fully operational and has produced a large number of soluble recombinant proteins in e. coli using the open reading frame cdna library  for c. elegans and human genomes  <cit> .

however, the success rate of expressing soluble proteins is limited when the full length orf was used to express the target protein. in a number of cases, including our own results, soluble proteins could be expressed in e. coli when a smaller fragment derived from the orf was used for expression  <cit> . we have identified smaller protein fragments from spontaneous degradation and limited proteolysis, and recloned them for expression  <cit> . compared to expressing soluble proteins carrying gateway tags due to cloning artifacts, the soluble expression rate was increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % when the gateway tags were not included, and a  <dig> % rate of soluble expression was achieved when the identified fragment without both gateway tag encoded sequences was recloned . the gateway tags named here refer to the amino acid sequences tslykkagx and tqlsctkw, resulted from the recombination site attb <dig> or attb <dig>  respectively, generated by the gaetway lr reaction  <cit> . x refers to the amino acid that depends on the coding sequence. with pet15g as the expression vector, which was engineered using pet15b  to be compatible with gateway cloning  <cit> , the final n-terminal tag sequences in the originally and newly cloned genes are mgsshhhhhhssglvprgsqstslykkagx and mgsshhhhhhssglvprgsqstslykkaglvprgs respectively, in which hhhhhh is the his-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site  deprived from pet15b vector, tslykkag is the n-terminal gateway tag generated by gateway lr reaction, and the last lvprgs is the newly introduced thrombin site  that is used to eliminate the n-terminal gateway tag. no c-terminal gateway tag was present in the newly cloned genes by the introduction of a stop codon after the coding sequence. thus the clones in which gateway tags were included expressed a recombinant protein that had sequence i, i.e. gsqstslykkagx at the n-terminus and sequence ii, i.e. tqlsctkw at the c-terminus in addition to the coding sequence after the his-tag was removed by protease digestion through the thrombin site i. in the clones without the gateway tags, the recombinant protein contained only gs at the n-terminus in addition to the coding sequence. more recently,  <dig> fragments were recloned and  <dig> of them have resulted in diffracting quality crystals, which led to  <dig> structures  <cit> . these findings suggested that the sequences derived from gateway tags affect the soluble expression and a well folded fragment/domain of the target protein is best suited for expression of a soluble recombinant protein in e. coli. in fact, 90% of the structures of human proteins deposited in the protein data bank   <cit>  comprise a fragment of the gene. we therefore modified our robotic pipeline to incorporate an automatic operation that can select a proper domain/fragment from the orf for recombinant protein expression and used new cloning strategy described above.

new bioinformatics tools and cloning methods were developed and adopted to the previously established robotic pipeline, as discussed in this report. the major modifications included the automatic design of pcr primers, and improved multi-step laddered pcr, followed by previously established micro bp reaction of gateway cloning, transformation, plating of transformed e. coli cells , colony picking and entry clone plasmid dna extraction. the automated cloning module is combined with our automated protein expression module that consists of construction of expression clones in 96-well plates, protein solubility profiling by dynamic elisa, as a protein expression platform for structural genomics/proteomics. the cloning module is flexible and efficient to carry out different cloning strategies as shown here.

a number of algorithms for predicting domain boundaries have been developed previously  <cit> . most of them, however, are not publicly available or cannot be adapted to our htp pipeline. we report here a new composite scheme to locate domains with relatively accurate boundaries. programs included in the scheme are interpro/interproscan  <cit>  and domain linker finder  <cit> , blast  <cit> , signalp  <cit>  and tmhmm  <cit> . the blast alignment and signal peptide, transmembrane  region prediction were combined with the results of interpro/interproscan and domain linker finder to define the fragment for cloning. this composite method has been validated with experimental results.

RESULTS
htp cloning of  <dig> orfs
the gateway system is a suitable method for htp cloning in 96-well plates. however, when entry clones  and the expression vector pet15g are combined by the lr reaction, the recombination sequence attb <dig> may add additional unwanted  <dig> amino acids  at the n-terminus if the insert is downstream from a fusion peptide, and the attb <dig> site may add tqlsctkw at the c-terminus if no stop codon follows the coding sequence. we named sequences from attb <dig> and attb <dig> as the gateway tags. the additional amino acids derived from gateway tags may interfere with subsequent experiments, such as soluble expression of the recombinant protein, purification problems due to aggregation of the protein, and crystallization of the protein . it is therefore desirable to engineer a protease  cleavage site  after attb <dig> . a stop codon was also added right after the coding sequence in primer design to eliminate the extra amino acids at the c-terminus due to gateway cloning. after the protein is purified, all amino acids prior to pcs, i.e. mgsshhhhhhssglvprgsqstslykkaglvpr, can be removed by the protease cleavage. compared with the clones in which gateway tags were included, newly cloned and expressed recombinant proteins contained only gs at the n-terminus in addition to the coding sequence. and if no new pcs was introduced, expressed proteins would have sequence i, i.e. gsqstslykkagx at the n-terminus and sequence ii, i.e. tqlsctkw at the c-terminus in addition to the coding sequence after the his-tag was removed by protease digestion through the thrombin site i . since the pcs was included in the primer synthesis in our strategy and the long forward primer would be costly and could increase the chance of errors, we designed a pcr strategy using two forward primers and two reverse primers . this strategy has two advantages: only short primers are required, and primer f <dig>  r <dig> could be synthesized in bulk. such measures significantly reduce the cost and the error rate in 96-well operations.

a comprehensive computer program has been developed to carry out primer designs for selected genes. usually the length of the gene-specific nucleotides in the entire primer should be maintained between  <dig> to  <dig> bases according to the manufacturer's manual  <cit>  and our previous experience. the length of gene-specific oligos in this program is therefore set in this range. since pcr clones are to be carried out in 96-well plates, conditions for all wells, such as denaturation time, cycle number, are the same even though each well represents a different gene. therefore in addition to grouping coding regions with a similar length in one plate, we also chose to design primers that would result in a similar melting temperature . the best value for tm was about 60°c for our experiments, so we tried to make the tm of all oligos as close to 60°c as possible by adding or subtracting one base at a time. besides the length of oligos, the salt concentration can also affect the tm. in our program, the salt concentration was set at  <dig> mm. after the gene-specific oligo was designed with optimal tm, sequences corresponding to attb <dig> or attb <dig>  pcs and a stop codon were added. the primer design program was written in perl, which could be easily modified to accommodate changes in primer sequences.

after receiving primers for  <dig> c. elegans,  <dig> brucella, and  <dig> human orfs in 96-well plate, htp cloning , including pcr, e-gel check, bp reaction, transformation, colony picking, cell culture and mini-prep, was performed on our integrated robotic platform. from  <dig> attempted amplifications,  <dig> pcr products could be detected by e-gel . interestingly,  <dig> vectors, out of  <dig>  whose pcr products could not be detected by e-gel could still be transformed and obtained as entry clones successfully. this phenomenon has also been observed by other research groups  <cit> . including clones that were derived from pcr products not detectable by e-gel, but transformed successfully, our pcr protocol showed a success rate of  <dig> %. our follow-up results suggested that pcr determines the final success rate of the whole htp cloning process , whereas other steps, such as bp reaction, transformation, have negligible effects on the final outcome. finally  <dig> % orfs were obtained as entry clones, which were verified by pcr/e-gel check.

validation of domain identification
proteins are usually composed of multiple domains connected by linkers. removal of flexible tails or separation of fragments would yield more compact and stable protein fragments that are more suitable for expression of a soluble recombinant protein and subsequent studies including crystallization, as demonstrated by data presented below. we aimed at developing an integrated strategy, named ddbp , to predict domain boundaries and stable fragments within the full length protein coded by the orf. in this strategy, interpro/interproscan, pdb homology alignment, and domain linker finder were the core methods used for domain prediction. in addition, signal peptide prediction by signalp and tm regions prediction by tmhmm provided supplementary information for more accurate prediction.

interpro is an integrated database that consists of most of the essential databases for domain and function site available today, such as pfam  <cit> , prodom  <cit> , smart  <cit> , prints  <cit> , prosite  <cit> , tigrfam  <cit> , superfamily  <cit> , etc. interproscan, which is used together with interpro database, is a tool that combines different protein signature recognition methods into one resource. since interpro contains many different domain and function site databases, conflicted results often appear when different databases were used. moreover, interpro/interproscan analysis could only predict the core region of a domain, but not the domain boundaries. to improve the prediction accuracy, domain linker finder , which applies the neural network method to distinguish domain linker sequences from non-linker sequences, was used to confirm domain prediction results obtained by interpro/interproscan, and to define more accurately the domain boundaries.

as the first step of ddbp, prediction of the signal peptide and the tm region for each orf was carried out by signalp and tmhmm, respectively. the identified signal peptide was eliminated as an unstable region, and tm regions would be treated as domain linkers that were later integrated into the results from dlf. the second step is to perform blast analysis against the pdb database to find potential domain relevant information. finally interpro/interproscan and dlf programs were executed.

when results of interpro/interproscan and dlf were available, further analyses were performed:  if results of interpro/interproscan can be confirmed by pdb alignment results, manually integrate them and decide common domain boundary positions. for example, protein 3-h <dig>  i.e. np_ <dig> , which comprises  <dig> amino acids, has no signal peptide and tm regions according to the prediction of signalp and tmhmm. the result of interpro/interproscan showed this protein contains three possible domains/fragments: domain <dig> , domain <dig>  and domain <dig> . while pdb alignment results showed:  the region 4– <dig> of 3-h <dig> is homologous to the region 20– <dig> of a 149-amino-acid protein  with 60% identity;  the region 4– <dig> of 3-h <dig> is similar to the region 41– <dig> of a 280-amino-acid protein  with 48% identity;  the region 7– <dig> of 3-h <dig> is similar to the region 24– <dig> of a 457-amino-acid protein  with 40% identity;  the region 128– <dig> of 3-h <dig> is similar to the region 22– <dig> of a 336-amino-acid protein  with 35% identity. the results from interpro/interproscan prediction appear to be consistent with the results of pdb alignments. by combining these two results, three protein fragments were selected for 3-h6: 1– <dig>  128– <dig>  and 245– <dig> as the stable region.  if results of interpro/interproscan and pdb alignments were not consistent, but one of two results could be confirmed by dlf, the consistent results were manually combined and domain boundary positions were assigned. tm regions were integrated with the result from dlf at this stage as well. for example, 11020-h <dig>  i.e. the region 299– <dig> of np_ <dig> , a 494-amino-acid protein without tm regions and a signal peptide, was predicted to have three possible domains/fragments by interpro/interproscan  and no homologous protein structures were found by pdb alignment. dlf results showed that protein 11020-h <dig> may contain five possible domain linkers , in which dl <dig> and dl <dig> were consistent with fragment <dig>  the n-terminal end of fragment2; and dl <dig> was consistent with the n-terminal end of fragment <dig>  dl <dig> was ignored. since fragment <dig> was contained within fragment <dig>  it is possible that fragment <dig> might contain at least two domains, and fragment <dig> might be one of them. the final predicted stable domains/fragments of 11020-h <dig> were: 53– <dig>  236– <dig> and 331–494;  if results of interpro/interproscan and pdb alignments were not consistent, and no result from dlf was available or the dlf prediction didn't support any results from interpro/interproscan or pdb alignments, the n-terminus and c-terminus of the orf would be treated as domain boundaries. after completing the prediction, a final check was performed to ensure that the region between two predicted domain boundaries should be at least  <dig> amino acids. if a predicted domain contained less than  <dig> amino acids, one of the two domain boundaries with a less reliability would be omitted and the domain was joined to the next domain/fragment, except that positive pdb alignment results were available and supported that the short predicted domain was long enough to form a stable domain.

in order to validate this combination scheme, we constructed a dataset that contains the definition of  <dig> domains/fragments from our experimental results  and made a comparison between the experimental and ddbp prediction results . in the comparison, the experimentally determined domain/domain boundaries are assumed to be correct domain/domain boundaries. for a protein, whatever how many domains it contained or were predicted, if only two boundaries of one predicted domain were same with those of one correct domain, or its ranges < = + <dig> aa, this prediction would be as an accurate prediction. similarly, if  <dig> aa < ranges < = + <dig> aa, the prediction would be as a basically accurate prediction, and if range > + <dig> aa, the prediction would be as a wrong prediction. for example, protein 11011-d <dig>  has one experimental determined domain: 45– <dig>  with ddbp method, it was predicted with two possible domains: 1– <dig> or 52– <dig>  because one of predicted domains  was consistent with the correct result, i.e. ranges  < = + <dig> aa, this prediction was as a accurate prediction. protein 4-f <dig>  has one experimentally determined domain  and its predicted domains by ddbp method were 1– <dig> and 143– <dig>  by comparison, 4-f <dig> was thought as a basically accurate prediction because its ranges  < = + <dig> and > + <dig> aa. the complete comparison for all  <dig> domains were listed in table  <dig>  as showed that more than 60% of the prediction was consistent with experimental results, in which 43% was accurate  and 19% was basically accurate .

application of the ddbp method and the improved cloning strategy
we applied the ddbp method and the improved cloning strategy to see if the success rate for obtaining purified soluble recombinant proteins would be greatly improved when the predicted fragments were cloned for expressing recombinant proteins in e. coli. the test dataset includes  <dig> proteins from c. elegans orfeome version  <dig> , whose expression/purification data of orfs using the same expression vector were available from previous experiments. for these  <dig> proteins, the coding regions corresponding to the ddbp predicted fragments were subjected to htp cloning, and the expression/purification pipeline, in which  <dig> ones were shortened constructs.

previously, all full-length proteins in this dataset, with the gateway tags included at the n-terminus and the c-terminus, were treated as soluble by the 96-well expression profiling when expressed in e. coli. however, all but two proteins could not be purified from e. coli lysates prepared for expressing these proteins. most of the recombinant proteins in this dataset were either unstable or formed large aggregates as shown by gel filtration chromatography. in contrast, after employing the ddbp method and improved cloning strategy that avoids gateway encoded sequences,  <dig> proteins were expressed as soluble , and until now, at least  <dig> were successfully purified , among which four proteins had been crystallized , despite that seven proteins were insoluble . there is a 10-fold increase in terms of obtaining purified proteins from this dataset, as shows the combination of ddbp method and our cloning strategy is successful and results in a clearly improved protein expression and purification. however we do not know whether the observed improvement mainly deprives from a correct domain prediction since most proteins in our testing set only have the shortened or the full length construct and the completely comparison cannot be done.

np_ <dig> and np_ <dig> are two only proteins with shortened and full length constructs in the test dataset. notably, the shortened constructs of these two proteins are successfully expressed and purified, while their full length constructs are not soluble or cannot be purified. though this result has no statistic meaning for ddbp method, it at least affirms that the ddbp is an effective method for some kinds of protein to find proper domain/fragment from the orf for recombinant protein expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we presented an effective htp cloning pipeline and a domain/domain boundary prediction  strategy. with this pipeline, four 96-well plates of genes could be cloned into an expression vector in seven days. after integrating the domain/domain boundary prediction strategy, the success rate of purification and crystallization was shown to increase dramatically. moreover, this cloning pipeline, combined with our recombinant protein htp expression pipeline and the crystal screening platform, constitutes a complete platform for structure genomics/proteomics. in the next stage, we will improve the accuracy of bioinformatics analysis of domain and domain boundaries and automates all bioinformatics procedures.
