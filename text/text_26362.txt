BACKGROUND
for many years, the most well-studied sequences in the human genome have been those of protein-coding genes. nevertheless, most of the genome is transcribed as non-coding rna  and is never translated into protein  <cit> . it has become increasingly apparent that ncrna is crucially important for a wide array of cellular functions  <cit> .

the class of small non-coding rnas termed y rnas have a function as essential factors for the initiation of chromosomal dna replication in mammalian somatic cells  <cit> . y rnas have originally been described as the rna component of ro ribonucleoprotein particles , which contain proteins ro <dig> and la and are detected by autoimmune antibodies from patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . despite their relatively small size, y rnas are involved in several independent cellular pathways, including rna surveillance and rna quality control, in addition to dna replication . y rnas have been shown to biochemically interact and co-localize with several proteins that are essential for the initiation of dna replication, including the origin recognition complex, orc  <cit> .

the individual y rna genes are located in close proximity to each other in vertebrate genomes, including human, mouse and xenopus  <cit> . the rna polymerase iii transcribes each gene from an upstream class  <dig> promoter. there are four distinct y rnas in humans  and only two y rnas in mice  and other rodents, where they all range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides   <cit> . all y rnas form characteristic stem − loop structures, which are due to partially complementary 5′ and 3′ domains that form the lower and upper stems with a large internal loop  <cit> . the highly conserved upper stem domain of vertebrate y rnas is essential and sufficient for their dna replication initiation function, due to the presence of a functionally essential gug-cac trinucleotide motif  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism underpinning this function is currently unknown.

cells of the chinese hamster  have become an important model to study metazoan dna replication, in particular lung fibroblasts that were selected for overproduction of adenylate deaminase  <dig>  due to local gene amplification by a treatment with coformycin  <cit> . in an amplified locus containing the ampd <dig> and other genes, the orignai <dig> dna replication origin was detected by 2d gel electrophoresis and competitive pcr replicon mapping techniques  <cit> . by means of the dynamic molecular combing procedure, it was possible to map three more dna replication origins  in that polygenic region  <cit> . additionally, these dna replication origins co-localize with a + t rich regions identified as matrix attachment regions  <cit> . our laboratory has recently identified, through in silico and circular permutation analysis, that these dna replication origin sequences are situated in nucleosome-free regions and are associated with intrinsically bent dna segments  <cit> . therefore, chinese hamster cells are an excellent model system for analyzing chromosomal dna replication at a local level. however, y rnas that may play an essential role in this process have not been described in this organism to date. therefore, we have searched for homologs of human y rna genes in the genome of this rodent.

here we report the identification of four genes coding for chinese hamster y rnas . we have characterized the predicted secondary structures of chy rnas and analyzed the expression of chy rnas in chinese hamster cells. we have tested whether synthetic chy rnas can functionally substitute the human y rnas in a cell-free dna replication system. lastly, since chy <dig> rna has an evolutionarily divergent secondary structure in the upper stem from other vertebrate y rnas, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulation analysis to investigate whether this segment is expected to be stable at physiological conditions.

RESULTS
homology search and predicted secondary structures
after performing a homology search in the chinese hamster genome, we found four candidate genes that could be homologs of human y rnas. these genes received an annotation and can be accessed at genbank by codes:  chy <dig>   chy <dig>   chy <dig>  and  chy <dig> . in addition to the gene body, these chy rna genes had signatures for promoter and terminator elements for transcription by rna polymerase iii . nucleotide sequences and predicted secondary structures of y rnas are conserved within vertebrates  <cit> . the sizes of all four chy rnas are similar to their homologous hy rnas. the chy <dig>  chy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas feature all the expected structural motifs of the corresponding hy rna secondary structures, including the ro60-binding lower stem, the dna replication-promoting upper stem and a heterologous central loop . in contrast, chy <dig> rna has a shorter upper stem and a bigger loop between stems than the hy <dig> rna . at the nucleotide sequence level, the chy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas have a high degree of similarity with their human homologues, while chy <dig> and chy <dig> are less conserved .fig.  <dig> nucleotide sequences and predicted secondary structures of human and chinese hamster y rnas. comparison between hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas , hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas , hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas , and hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas . black brackets indicate locations of conserved structural elements, with their known functions described alongside. essential for dna replication, the gug-cac sequence motif is highlighted in blue and orange respectively. the divergent nucleotides between hy and chy rnas are shown in yellow




genes coding for y rnas are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, though different numbers of y rna genes exist in different species due to gene losses, duplications and rearrangements  <cit> . in different rodent lineages, y <dig> and y <dig> genes are highly conserved and expressed, whereas y <dig> and y <dig> genes are often lost, or only present in the genome as remnant ‘fossil genes’ at their conserved syntenic locations   <cit> . therefore, we investigated next whether all four chy rna genes are expressed in chinese hamster cells.

expression analysis of chy rnas
we determined the relative expression levels for each of the four chy rnas by quantitative real-time pcr. to standardize chy rna expression levels, we normalized the qpcr data to chy <dig> rna, which showed the highest relative expression level. the results are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> chy rna expression analysis

mean values and standard deviations of the chy rna expression analysis from  <dig> to  <dig> independent experiments are shown.  = relative expression levels of each chy rna, normalized to the amount of chy <dig> rna molecules



of the four genes coding for y rnas that are present in the chinese hamster genome, only chy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas are expressed to high and mutually comparative levels in the gma <dig> cell line. in contrast, chy <dig> and chy <dig> rna expression levels were detected at levels between four to five orders of magnitude below those of chy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas , indicating that they may be minimally expressed, if at all. therefore, the situation in chinese hamster cells is similar to other rodents, where y <dig> and y <dig> rnas are not detectably expressed, and the corresponding genomic sequences are considered as “fossil” genes  <cit> . this could explain the level of nucleotide divergence between the chinese hamster and the human y <dig> and y <dig> rnas. however, a sequence analysis of the promoter regions of the y <dig> rna genes of homo sapiens, c. griseus and mus musculus revealed the presence of all expected type  <dig> promoter elements recognized by rna polymerase iii, with a high level of conservation  . this preservation of functional promoter elements therefore suggests that other factors are likely regulating the expression of rodent y rnas, such as epigenetic modifications or post-transcriptional degradation.

within each species, and even across vertebrate species boundaries, individual y rnas show functional redundancy with each other as dna replication factors in vitro  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that in order to compensate for the absence of y <dig> and y <dig> rna expression, the expression of y <dig> and y <dig> rnas may be upregulated in rodents compared to human and other species expressing more than two y rnas.

dna replication in vitro
next we analyzed if chy rnas could functionally substitute for the hy rnas in a human cell-free dna replication system. in this system, a cytosolic extract from human proliferating cells initiates and supports bidirectional semiconservative dna replication in more than 60 % of template nuclei, which are prepared from late g <dig> phase human cells . this extract contains endogenous hy rnas and all essential soluble dna replication proteins. in the absence of the cytosolic extract, dna replication is observed only in approximately 5 % of the nuclei . the endogenous hy rnas can be depleted from the cytosolic extract by biochemical fractionation, yielding two protein fractions containing all essential initiation proteins . incubation of template nuclei with these two fractions alone resulted in dna replication in 20 % of the nuclei , likely due to small amounts of residual y rnas remaining from the fractionation of the cytosolic extract  <cit> . as shown before  <cit> , addition of purified exogenous hy <dig> rna increased the proportion of replicating nuclei to about 40 %, whereas addition of human ribosomal 5s rrna as a negative control did not increase the proportion of replicating nuclei in this system . next, we synthesized all four chy rnas in vitro and tested whether they could substitute for hy <dig> rna in this assay. indeed, each of the four chy rnas significantly increased the proportion of nuclei replicating their chromosomal dna over the negative control, 5s rrna , and to the same extent as hy <dig> rna  therefore, chy rnas can substitute for hy rnas to initiate and support dna replication in vitro.fig.  <dig> chinese hamster y rnas can substitute for hy rnas for the reconstitution of chromosomal dna replication. quantitative analysis of replicating g1-phase nuclei in vitro . human ej <dig> nuclei were separately incubated with buffer, unfractionated cytosol of hela cells , fractions qa and arft, and with fractions supplemented with 300 ng of the individual rnas synthesized in vitro as indicated  <cit> . the human 5s ribosomal rna was used as negative control. mean values and standard deviations of the proportions of replicating nuclei from  <dig> to  <dig> independent experiments  are shown. *p <  <dig>   when compared to negative control reaction containing 5s rrna



it is known that vertebrate y rnas can functionally substitute for human y rnas in chromosomal dna replication in a cell-free system  <cit> , and that human y rnas can replace mouse y rnas in a mouse cell-free dna replication initiation system  <cit> . our analysis reported here therefore consolidates the functional conservation of vertebrate y rnas and extends it to the chinese hamster.

although the expression analysis reveals the absence of detectable chy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas in gma <dig> chinese hamster cells , both rnas were able to initiate dna replication in vitro . this is probably because these silent chy rnas still feature functional motifs of y rnas . in a systematic mutagenesis screen, the upper stem of y rnas was shown to be essential and sufficient for chromosomal dna replication in vitro and in vivo, showing that this domain is a key determinant for y rna function  <cit> . for the nucleotide sequences and predicted secondary structures of chy rnas, the upper stem of chy <dig> rna shows the greatest divergence from the consensus. it maintains the base-paired nucleotide gug-cac consensus motif essential for dna replication, but flanking sequences are no longer predicted to form a base-paired double-stranded rna helix . to see if this domain may still assume an overall stable helix-like structure, which might be important to its observed dna replication function, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations under physiological conditions. we sought to evaluate the stability of chy <dig> rna compared to hy <dig> rna, focusing on the upper stem gug-cac base pairs.

molecular modeling and dynamics of y <dig> rnas
we generated predicted three-dimensional structures from the primary nucleotide sequences of human and chinese hamster y rnas and generated pdb files for visualization , using the rna composer server  <cit> . in the three-dimensional ribbon band representations of the two y <dig> rnas, the conserved and functionally essential gug-cac trinucleotide motifs are located in an exposed and extended region of the molecules, which could facilitate an interaction with a cellular target .fig.  <dig> ribbon model of y <dig> rnas. the illustration highlights the location of the functional motif gug-cac in the predicted 3d ribbon model structures of  hy <dig> rna and  chy <dig> rna



these 3d structures of y <dig> rnas were then used for simulations of equilibration molecular dynamics, and the analysis of their behavior was performed from the trajectory file. figure 4a shows the root mean square deviation  calculated from the c1′ carbon of each nucleotide. these results provide evidence that both hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas reached equilibrium already after 3 ns of simulation time. the molecular dynamics simulations are usually performed for a longer period of time  <cit> , however, and fig. 4a shows that 10 ns was a sufficient time to have an overall picture of the system in balance. figure 4b shows the radius of molecular gyration of the two y <dig> rnas during the simulation. the chy <dig> rna oscillates around  <dig> Å ±  <dig>  while the hy <dig> rna oscillates around  <dig>  Å ±  <dig> . this result indicates that the segments of both rna models representing the c1′ carbon of each nucleotide keep their original fold design over simulation time, indicative of stable structures for both hy <dig> and chy <dig> rnas.fig.  <dig> simulation behavior of the y <dig> rnas. the trajectory of the molecular dynamics was analyzed from c1′ of y <dig> rnas in terms of root mean square deviation  and radius of gyration . the simulation was carried out with periodic boundary conditions at 300 k temperature, 1 atm pressure, ph  <dig> , nacl  <dig>  m



the root mean square fluctuation  for each nucleotide of hy <dig> and chy <dig> rna is shown in fig.  <dig>  according to these simulations, the region of the functional gug-cac motif in the hy <dig> rna showed an increasing rmsd value reaching  <dig>  Å towards the open central loop domain . the homologous region in chy <dig> rna, despite being located in a highly flexible region between two loops, presents a constant low rmsf value of approximately  <dig>  Å , suggesting that this region appears to be a little more stable in chy <dig> than in hy <dig> rna. most of this stability is due to the watson–crick base pairing of both motifs, which tends to be more stable than the non-canonical g-u base pairing  <cit> . in addition, we observed a constant number of hydrogen bonds formed between the base pairs of gug-cac over the simulation time for both chy <dig> and hy <dig> rnas .fig.  <dig> fluctuation of c1′ atoms of each nucleotide from y <dig> rna segments. a hy <dig> rha and b chy <dig> rna. the blue squares highlight the root mean square fluctuation of the functional motif gug-cac showing that these triplets fluctuate much less than other regions of the molecule

we conclude that the predicted structural stability of this functional double-stranded region in chy <dig> rna could be relevant for the interaction of y rnas with their cellular targets  and would allow this rna to perform its function in dna replication like other vertebrate y rnas. we have recently investigated the solution structure of the corresponding domain in hy <dig> rna and obtained biophysical evidence for a dynamic structure of the conserved gug-cac motif, which is embedded in a stable a-form helix representing the entire upper stem domain  <cit> . future experiments will be required to characterize the functional interaction of this conserved domain with relevant binding proteins or chromatin structures in the vicinity of dna replication origins.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified that the chinese hamster genome contains four individual genes for chy rnas . although these genes are homologous to the four human hy rna genes, only the two chy <dig> and chy <dig> rna genes, which have the highest level of homology to the corresponding human genes, are expressed. the predicted structures of these chinese hamster rna molecules show a high level of conservation with the hy rnas, except for chy <dig>  but the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the three-dimensional structures of both chy <dig> and hy <dig> rnas should be stable under physiological conditions. functional testing of the chy rnas established that they can substitute for hy rnas to initiate the dna replication in vitro. in conclusion, the results of this work establish that the structure and function of vertebrate y rnas extends to the chinese hamster, which now allows future investigations of chy rna-dependent regulation of dna replication in the interesting case of the replication origins of the ampd <dig> amplicon.
