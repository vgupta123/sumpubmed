BACKGROUND
high levels of dietary lipids are used in commercial atlantic salmon diets to promote rapid growth and as a inexpensive source of energy. these high lipid levels may promote excess lipid deposition in the viscera and the muscle, thereby reducing the market quality of the fish. thus, tetradecylthioacetic acid 13-s−ch2-cooh) has been tested for aquaculture nutrition, initially to increase lipid catabolism and thereby reducing lipid deposition
 <cit> . however, beneficial effects on cardiac growth and disease resistance have also been addressed.

tta is a modified fatty acid  that possesses a sulfur atom in the βposition. like a normal fa, tta can be converted to co-enzyme a thioester, but further catabolism by β-oxidation does not occur. this lack of metabolism is likely to determine the biological effects of tta. biological effects of tta have been the focus of extensive research in rodents and also in humans. the most important findings from these experiments are that tta increases the mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation and possesses hypolipidemic effects. in addition, tta acts as an antioxidant in vivo and can modulate the inflammatory response . cell culture experiments demonstrated that tta can act as a ligand for all peroxisome proliferator activated receptors 
 <cit> , which are ligand-activated transcription factors. upon ligand activation ppars heterodimerizes with retinoic-x-acid receptor  and have been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, cell differentiation, development and inflammation . arguably most of the biological effects of tta are mediated through activation of ppars.

studies addressing the biological effects of tta in atlantic salmon have demonstrated that tta increases β-oxidation in the liver
 <cit>  and white muscle
 <cit> . furthermore, tta reduces the secretion of triacylglycerides from atlantic salmon hepatocytes in vitro <cit>  and has been shown to increase the expression of genes associated with fat metabolism in the liver and the heart ventricle
 <cit> . previous results also suggested that tta stimulates the transcription of pparαand β in the heart
 <cit> , thus indicating that tta affects the metabolism in atlantic salmon through activation of ppars, similar to the mechanism known from rodents. interestingly, this activation of ppars may have been related to increased survival after a natural outbreak of a heart related viral disease in atlantic salmon
 <cit> . in mammals, cardiac activation of ppars has yielded substantial attention due to the fact that ppars have been proven to be major regulators of cardiac metabolism
 <cit> . in addition, ppar agonists have been reported to exert beneficial effects by attenuating the pathogenesis of heart failure and atherosclerosis
 <cit> .

poor development of the outer muscle layer, atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction have been related to under-dimensioned hearts and reduced cardiac function in atlantic salmon aquaculture, consequently resulting in increased mortality
 <cit> . therefore, methods to improve cardiac metabolism and performance in fish are needed; something which has been sparsely studied. it appears that, similar to the mammalian heart, the oxidative cardiac metabolism in fish depends on the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose
 <cit> .

this study aims to characterize the cardiac transcriptional response of atlantic salmon to a tta supplemented diet. a feeding trial was conducted in sea, feeding a control and tta supplemented diet during the first  <dig> weeks and only control diet for the subsequent  <dig> weeks of the experiment. fish were sampled both at the end of the tta feeding period  and at the end of the experiment . our results show that administration of tta to atlantic salmon resulted in a marked change of cardiac gene expression. the expression profile suggests that tta induces cardiac fatty acid oxidation, glycolysis, tca cycle and contractility as well as cardiac growth.

RESULTS
production data
atlantic salmon that were fed with  <dig> % tta had significantly lower fat content in the muscle at the  <dig> weeks sampling point, and showed a tendency for increased mean relative heart weight . no significant effect of tta on fish weight was detected. during the experiment none of the dietary groups showed higher mortality than the control group. in the heart ventricles,  <dig>  μgtta/gtissuewas detected at the  <dig> weeks sampling point in the tta group, while  <dig>  μgtta/gtissue was detected in the control group. based on the tta measurements of a group fed a higher  tta diet from the same trial, we can assume that the tta levels in the heart ventricles at the  <dig> weeks sampling point were no different to the control group .

values within the same row with different subscripts are significantly different . mean ± sem, the statistical unit is the mean of the net pen .  <dig> fish were used to calculate the net pen mean.

microarray analysis
rna cardiac samples from six individual fish from each dietary group and sampling point were used in the microarray analysis, utilizing the atlantic salmon siq <dig> microarray
 <cit>  in a one-color setup, resulting in a total of  <dig> arrays. after normalization and filtering,  <dig> probes  were classified as present. to obtain a global overview of the general structure of the dataset we applied correspondence analysis  as an explorative technique
 <cit> . the first  <dig> components of the ca are displayed, together explaining 67% of the total inertia of the different samples . the analysis shows a clear distinction between the two sampling points at  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks. it further shows a relatively dense cluster at the  <dig> weeks point with minor separation between samples from the tta and control group. even though it was impossible to draw a straight line to separate between the tta and control samples at the  <dig> weeks sampling point, we observed a clear tendency of separation.

to identify differentially expressed  probes in the data set we used moderated t-statistics
 <cit> , comparing samples from tta to control fed atlantic salmon for each sampling point.

sampling point:  <dig> weeks, end of tta feeding
at the  <dig> weeks sampling point, five genes were found to be de between the tta and the control fed group . the genes were: ephrin-b <dig>  arf gtpase-activating protein , f-box only protein  <dig> , angiopoietin-related protein  <dig>  and sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter  <dig> . ephrin-b <dig> was the only gene found to be down-regulated in the tta fed group.

ephrin-b <dig>  in mammals has been reported to be highly expressed in the heart and serves also as a marker for angiogenesis
 <cit> . the protein git- <dig> participates in pleiotropic cellular processes like cell migration and t-cell activation; however, a function affecting the structure of the cytoskeleton
 <cit>  may be relevant in our study. cardiomyocytes rely solely on the creatine transporter sc6a <dig> for the uptake of creatine from the plasma. over-expression of the creatinfabe transporter in mice has been reported to correlate with the myocardial creatine content, but also to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy
 <cit> . angiopoietin-related protein  <dig> possesses a role in regulating angiogenesis and is also known as a target gene for ppars and acts as an important stimulator of lipid metabolism
 <cit> .

sampling point:  <dig> weeks,  <dig> weeks post tta feeding
 <dig> probes  were found to be de between the tta and the control fed group at the  <dig> weeks sampling point. in order to facilitate a functional interpretation of the vast number of de genes, we tested them for enrichment  of go terms from the category “biological process”
 <cit> , using conditional hypergeometric testing
 <cit> . to ensure that one gene was represented by a maximum of one probe
 <cit> , probes matching the same gene were collapsed prior to hypergeometric testing. this step reduced the total number of probes in the data set from  <dig> to  <dig> probes and the number of de probes from  <dig> to  <dig> probes . from these  <dig> genes, 90% showed higher gene expression in the samples from tta fed fish.

conditional hypergeometric testing revealed significant over-representation of  <dig> go terms. to simplify interpretation, significant go terms were grouped into five categories according to their function in the heart . the grouping was further supported by a strong gene overlap between the different go terms within the categories . overall, the results from the enrichment analysis suggests an increased capacity of heart ventricles from tta fed atlantic salmon to catabolize lipids and glycogen. further, an increased capacity for cardiac contractility and cardiac tissue morphogenesis is indicated.

1number of times the go term is represented in the list of de genes, only go terms having ≥  <dig> genes were considered.

2number of times the go term is represented in the filtered list of genes on the array.

heart performance
the group fed tta showed an up-regulation in the expression of genes encoding contractile proteins like myosin heavy chain  <dig> , myosin light chain , cardiac myosin binding protein , cardiac troponin , myomesin- <dig>  and actin .

moreover, the same group showed increased expression of the cardiac homeodomain factor nkx <dig>  and the iroquois-related homeobox factors  <dig> and  <dig> . nkx <dig>  and the iroquois transcription factors have been reported to control cardiac morphogenesis and growth
 <cit> . furthermore, we observed increased expression of fk <dig> binding protein 1a and 1b  and na + /k + -transporting atpase subunitα <dig> , encoding an ion-pump responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients at the plasma membrane of the cardiomyocyte. decreased amounts of this transporter were found in biopsies from humans suffering heart failure
 <cit> . fkbp1a and b are known to interact with intracellular calcium-release channels. in cardiomyocytes fkbp1b is a binding partner for the major ca <dig> + release channel ryanodine receptor  <dig> . ryr <dig> is required for the ca <dig> + -induced ca <dig> +  release from the sacroplasmatic reticulum  causing activation of the contractile proteins. binding of fkbp1b to ryr <dig> results in channel closure. mice deficient for fkbp1b showed no divergence in the normal cardiac phenotype under normal conditions but showed exercise-induced arrhythmias
 <cit> . in relation to ca <dig> +  signaling, we also found the na + /ca <dig> + exchanger slc8a <dig> to be up-regulated. we also found an increased expression of the sr ca <dig> +  atpase  <dig> , encoding an sr calcium pump that is a key component of the cardiac excitation-contraction mechanism
 <cit> .

the kv channel interacting protein  <dig>  was found to be down-regulated. the protein kcnip <dig> is an integral part of the multimeric kv <dig> channel complex, and important for modulating the k-flux across this channel by causing a shortening of the cardiac action potential
 <cit> . prolongation of the cardiac action potential on the other hand, potentially caused by decreased kcnip <dig> expression, is associated to cardiac hypertrophy
 <cit> .

in summary, the results suggest an increased cardiac hypertrophy together with increased potential for cardiac contractility, as indicated by the higher transcription of the various ion channels/pumps and contractile proteins.

fat metabolism
nearly all of the genes in this group were up-regulated . we found up-regulation of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein hadha, the mitochondrial fatty acid transporter carnitine palmitoyltransferase , lipoprotein lipase , the mitochondrial acyl-coa dehydrogenases  and of peroxisomal multi-functional enzyme type  <dig> . we also observed an up-regulation of malonyl-coa decarboxylase . malonyl-coa is a potent inhibitor of cpt <dig> and thus crucial in regulating the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for catabolism. malonyl-coa decarboxylase has been reported to function as a positive regulator of cardiac fatty acid oxidation by decreasing the levels of the cpt <dig> inhibitor malonyl-coa
 <cit> . thus, the results indicate increased fatty acid oxidation capacity in cardiac ventricles from tta fed atlantic salmon.

glycolysis
the genes of the six go terms that were grouped together contained almost entirely genes encoding enzymes or subunits participating in glycolysis. we found increased expression of hexokinase  <dig> , the phospho-fructokinases aldolase a  and 6-phosphofructokinase type c , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and the pyruvate dehydrogenases dlat and opdx. in accordance, we also observed an increased expression of mlx-interacting protein , which has been suggested to be an essential regulator of cellular glycolysis
 <cit> . all of the genes showed increased transcription, therefore clearly indicating increased glycolysis in the hearts from tta fed atlantic salmon.

tricarboxylic acid  cycle
as in the previously described categories, almost all of the genes in this category showed an increased expression. the proteins encoded by nearly all of the genes in this category are part of the tca-cycle. for a graphical representation of the genes within the tca cycle, see additional file

qrt-pcr
to validate the microarray results, six genes were analyzed by qrt-pcr between the tta and control fed group for the  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks samples, using the same rna samples that were used in the microarray experiment. the results showed a significant correlation between the logfcs obtained by qrt-pcr and those obtained by microarray .

in addition, we measured the gene expression of the three ppar subtypes α,β and γ in control and tta fed atlantic salmon in the four different tissues: heart, muscle, liver and gut  from both sampling points . analyzing the expression levels using analysis of variance  showed that only the pparαexpression in the heart was significantly increased in the tta group. the gene expression levels of pparγ in heart and muscle were too low to allow reliable quantification. since the microarray data revealed quite clearly that tta affected genes are involved in regulating the heart performance, we used qrt-pcr to measure the expression of the cardiac transcription factors gata <dig>  mef2c and osteonectin . for all three transcription factors we observed a trend of higher mean transcription in the tta group , however, only mef2c showed statistical significance.

tta has previously been reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals
 <cit> . in this study tta had no effect on mitochondrial biogenesis as measured by the ratio of mt/ndna . in the liver we found a significant interaction between dietary treatment and time for mitochondrial biogenesis.

discussion
in the present study we investigated the response of atlantic salmon to tta during the seawater phase. the results from our study show that feeding tta had profound effects on the cardiac gene expression at sampling point  <dig> weeks,  <dig> weeks after tta feeding ended. the level of tta applied in the study was, with  <dig> %, lower than previous studies that have been conducted in atlantic salmon . the mortality rates previously observed in atlantic salmon in response to high tta levels was not observed in this study.

gene set over-representation of the transcription profile at  <dig> weeks shows an increased capacity of fat catabolism, glycolysis and activity of the tca cycle as well as cardiac contractility and cardiac hypertrophy. overall, the results suggest a scenario where cardiac ventricles of tta pre-fed fish are able to generate more energy via a tca-cycle that is fueled by metabolites from fat catabolism and glycolysis. tta functions as a ligand for all three ppar subtypes
 <cit> , which have crucial functions in the transcriptional regulation of cardiac metabolism. in mice the transcriptional effects of tta in the heart have been shown to be mediated almost exclusively via pparα <cit> . gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations have shown that pparα is a crucial transcription factor in the cardiac metabolism, regulating mainly cardiac fatty acid uptake and oxidation
 <cit> . furthermore, activation of pparαhas been demonstrated to shift cardiac energy utilization away from glucose and towards fatty acid oxidation, actually mimicking the cardiac phenotype observed in diabetic hearts
 <cit> . interestingly the cardiac phenotype of pparβ differs from that of pparα, indicating that both transcription factors regulate, at least partly, different subsets of genes in the heart. pparβ loss-of-function hearts suffer from myocardial lipid accumulation and cardiomyopathy
 <cit> . gain-of-function mutations on the other hand clearly show that pparβ positively regulates cardiac glucose utilization
 <cit> , and also stimulates cardiac growth
 <cit> . thus, the significantly higher cardiac transcription of pparα and the elevated mean transcription of pparβ/ in concert with the activation of their down-stream pathways, fat catabolism and the glycolysis pathway suggest that cardiac effects of tta in atlantic salmon are mediated by both pparα and pparβ. intriguingly, over-expression of a constitutively active form of pparβin murine skeletal muscle has been reported to mimic training-based muscle adaptation
 <cit> . hence, it has been speculated, in accordance with the results from pparβ over-expression in mice
 <cit> , that pparβcauses “physiological” cardiac hypertrophy
 <cit> .

between the  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks sampling points, the hearts grew by a considerable portion in absolute and relative terms. the gene expression profile in hearts of tta fed fish at  <dig> weeks suggests that the cardiac growth of tta fed fish is shifted towards “physiological” hypertrophy, which may translate to an increased cardiac output. this notion is supported by the expression profile found for the category “cardiac performance” at  <dig> weeks, unanimously pointing to an increased cardiac contractility and also showing up-regulation of crucial cardiac transcription factors. in particular the higher transcription of the cardiac transcription factors nkx <dig>  and mef2c can be regarded as markers for cardiac hypertrophy/growth. it has been demonstrated in mice that over-expression of mef2c is sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy
 <cit> . furthermore, both mef2c and nkx <dig>  have been shown, in vitro, to be regulated by pparα in cardiomyocytes
 <cit> .

it should also be noted that although we did not find significant differences in relative heart weight in this study, in other studies we found that tta significantly increases heart size in atlantic salmon
 <cit> , and that the effect seems to be correlated to the dose of tta . thus, it is tempting to speculate that the increase in relative heart weight may be related to the cardiac transcriptional changes induced by tta. a “cardiac exercise” stimulating effect is of high relevance for salmonid aquaculture. atlantic salmon, having a circulatory system that is naturally adapted to long migration routes and high activity, show alteration in cardiac morphology and a reduced relative heart weight in captivity
 <cit> . in addition, circulatory failure has been identified as an important cause of mortality in salmon farming
 <cit> . thus, using tta may be one way to support the cardiac performance of fish in captivity.

the highest tissue concentrations of tta in atlantic salmon, as well as in mice, can be found in the heart
 <cit> . in accordance, the heart was also the tissue where the strongest transcriptional response of pparαwas detected. the main transcriptional effects were found nine weeks after the tta feeding stopped and where our data suggested that the cardiac tissue levels of tta were neglectable. however, we have no information about the course of gene expression between both sampling points, thus it might very well be that the effects of sampling at  <dig> weeks are the remains of earlier, stronger transcriptional effects. it is remarkable that a similar, delayed response in expression of lipid metabolism related genes to tta has been observed in our previous atlantic salmon studies
 <cit> , indicating a common underlying mechanism. it is possible that the delay in transcriptional response is caused by a common, yet unknown, mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, based on results from microarray analysis, this study demonstrates that tta increases cardiac fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis as well as contractility and cardiac hypertrophy in atlantic salmon. the gene expression profiles further favor a scenario of “physiological” hypertrophy in response to tta. this increased cardiac efficiency may offer significant benefits in situations with increased oxygen demand.
