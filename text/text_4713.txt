BACKGROUND
molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses are typically limited by dna sequencing costs, and this forces investigators to choose between dense taxon sampling with a small number of maximally informative loci, or genome-scale sampling across a sparse taxon sample  <cit> . balancing these choices is particularly difficult in studies focused on recently diverged taxa or ancient rapid radiations, as taxon sampling needs to be sufficiently large to define the magnitude of intraspecific variation and the phylogenetic depth of shared alleles  <cit> . similarly, broad genome sampling is necessary to offset the low level of genetic divergence among individuals of recent co-ancestry and to overcome low phylogenetic signal to noise ratios characteristic of rapid radiations  <cit> . next generation dna sequencing is poised to bring the benefits of affordable genome-scale data collection to such studies at low taxonomic levels . massively parallel sequencing  has increased per instrument sequence output several orders of magnitude relative to sanger sequencing, with a proportional reduction in per-nucleotide sequencing costs  <cit> . in principle this could allow the rapid sequencing of large numbers of entire organellar genomes  or nuclear loci, and result in greatly increased phylogenetic resolution  <cit> . to date, comparatively few plant or animal evolutionary genetic analyses have utilized mps  <cit> , due to associated costs and the technical challenge of assembling large contiguous sequences from micro-reads. these barriers have been largely eliminated through four innovations: development of strategies for targeted isolation of large genomic regions  <cit> ; harnessing the capacity of these platforms to sequence targeted regions in multiplex  <cit> ; streamlining sample preparation and improving throughput  <cit> ; and developing accurate de novo assemblers that reduce reliance upon a predefined reference sequence  <cit> .

in this paper we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of mps-based chloroplast phylogenomics for one-third of the world's pine species , a lineage with numerous unresolved relationships based on previous cpdna-based studies  <cit> . we also highlight the broad applicability of our approach to other plant taxa, and remark on the potential applications to similar mitochondrial-based studies in animals and plant dna barcoding. using multiplex mps approaches, we sequenced nearly-complete chloroplast genomes  each total length) from  <dig> species in pinus and four relatives in pinaceae. our sampling of pinus includes both subgenera  and species exemplars chosen from all  <dig> taxonomic subsections  <cit>  to evenly cover the phylogenetic diversity of the genus. taxon density is highest for a chosen subsection  as representative of a species-rich clade lacking phylogenetic resolution in previous studies  <cit> . three species are also represented by two chloroplast genomes each .

RESULTS
genomic assemblies and alignment
assemblies in subgenus strobus averaged  <dig> kb, with an estimated  <dig> % missing data ; subg. pinus assemblies averaged just less than  <dig> kb . outgroup assemblies averaged just over  <dig> kb . median coverage depth for determined positions was variable but typically high  . full alignment of all assemblies was  <dig>  bp in length, including  <dig>  bp from exons encoding  <dig> conserved protein coding genes ,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas. a high degree of co-linearity is inferred for these genomes due to the absence of major rearrangements within de novo contigs, and by the overall success of the polymerase chain reaction-based sequence isolation strategy . however, minor structural changes  could not be confirmed. no evidence of interspecific recombination was detected, consistent with the rarity of recombination in plant plastomes  <cit> .

"/" indicates accession was multiplex sequenced in two sequencing runs. median coverage is reported for determined positions  in reference-guided analysis.

the aligned matrix contained  <dig>  parsimony informative ingroup substitutions  . over one-half of parsimony informative sites  in protein coding regions resided in ycf <dig> and ycf <dig>  two large genes of uncertain function  <cit> , that accounted for 22% of all exon sequence . no other exons in the pine plastome exhibit such a disproportionate number of parsimony informative sites . these loci have an elevated nonsynonymous substitution rate  and appear to have a substantial number of indels in pinus, although it was not possible in many cases to confidently score indels in these loci due to the inherent limitations of reference-guided assembly of short reads in length variable regions. start codon position, overall length and stop codon positions were nonetheless largely preserved in these loci across the genus. in addition to substitutions in exons,  <dig> ingroup exon indels and  <dig> ingroup stop codon shifts were identified in  <dig> loci.

phylogenetic resolution in non-random and randomized data partitions
full alignment partitions yielded a higher proportion of highly supported nodes, with  <dig> to 91%  of ingroup nodes resolved with bootstrap support ≥ 95% in likelihood analysis. the four largest data partitions tested  yielded results that were topologically identical with the exception of four taxa  . in addition, support for the branching order of p. cembra, p. koraiensis and p. sibirica was low in full alignment partitions. topological differences were found to be significant according to shimodaira-hasegawa comparisons of the full alignment topology to two of the other major partitions . trends in significance were most strongly influenced by the two alternative positions of p. krempfii . with the exception of p. krempfii, areas of topological uncertainty reside in a single clade that historically has lacked internal resolution   <cit> . coalescent estimations suggest that these poorly resolved subsection strobus haplotypes diverged in rapid succession relative to the age of their shared nodes  . a putative chloroplast capture event in p. lambertiana previously documented  <cit>  was also supported with whole-plastome results. substantial resolution was achieved in analyses of ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> data partitions, however we observed several topological differences from the full alignment with high support  .

all divergence time estimates assume a chloroplast mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/year. coalescent units reported are based on either high  or low  effective population  sizes. maximum likelihood  branch lengths are shown as substitutions/site. estimated divergence times are presented in years , generations  and coalescent units for high/low ne .

of the  <dig> exon coding indels and stop codon shifts identified,  <dig> mapped unambiguously to monophyletic groups  . all of these groups had strong support in nucleotide-based phylogenetic analyses . the remainder of these events were primarily either putatively monophyletic  or showed strong evidence of homoplasy .

in parsimony analyses of variable-sized jackknife samples of our full alignment, nodal support showed a strong positive correlation with the length of the nucleotide matrix  . resolution of full alignment and exon nucleotide partitions was indistinguishable from random jackknife samples of comparable size, indicating similar phylogenetic content of these partitions and corresponding similar-sized random genomic subsamples. partitions consisting of ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> - in particular ycf <dig>  and ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> combined - showed significantly higher resolution than the genome-wide average . the concatenated partition ycf <dig> + ycf <dig>  yielded only slightly less phylogenetic resolution than all exons combined  in parsimony analysis.

comparisons to previous pinus phylogenies
previous cpdna based estimates of infrageneric relationships in pinus  <cit>  sampled the same species and/or lineages as our study, and inferred relationships using  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb of chloroplast dna. results of these studies are largely consistent with our results, although highly supported nodes  accounted for only  <dig> to 23% of the total ingroup nodes . the empirical results of these studies fell within or close to the 95% prediction intervals established from our jackknife resampling response from our full genome alignment , indicating that the loci used in prior studies  are similarly informative as a comparable sample of random nucleotides from the chloroplast genome.

meta-analysis of published infrageneric studies
from our sampling, infrageneric analyses in plants published from  <dig> to  <dig> were typically based on  <dig> aligned bp  of sequence data, evaluated  <dig>  ingroup species , and resolved  <dig> % of nodes at ≥ 95% bootstrap support . regression analysis shows that the proportion of highly resolved nodes in these studies is significantly and positively correlated with matrix length  but not the number of included taxa , although there was a negative trend in the latter . our current sample size is typical in the number of taxa sampled, but both matrix length  and the proportion of highly bootstrap-supported nodes  were substantially higher.

discussion
our results highlight that whole plastome sequencing is now a feasible and effective option for inferring phylogenies at low taxonomic levels. compared to previous chloroplast-based phylogenetic analyses in pinus, our data matrix contained approximately  <dig> times more phylogenetically informative characters resulting in an approximately two- to four-fold increase in the proportion of highly resolved nodes  . an important question arising from these comparisons is whether the difference in resolution is entirely attributable to the increase in nucleotides, or whether the genomic partitions sequenced in prior studies were less informative on average than the rest of the genome. in fact, the resolution provided by loci used in previous pinus studies is indistinguishable from or slightly greater than that of comparably sized random genomic subsamples from our full alignment. combined with the strong correlation between resolution and the size of random genomic subsample, this suggests that the increase in resolution in this study is primarily due to the increase in matrix length. this is further supported by a significant relationship between resolution and matrix length in a broad sampling of chloroplast-based infrageneric phylogenies. based on these results, we predict that whole-plastome analysis will yield similar gains in phylogenetic resolution not only in the genus pinus but for most land plant genera. on the other hand, it is apparent that even the entire chloroplast genome may be insufficient to fully resolve the most rapidly radiating lineages. in this regard, our results are reflective of previous analyses of ancient rapid radiations wherein nodal resolution does not scale proportionately to the length of sequence analyzed  <cit> . notably, the position of p. krempfii was significantly different between the four largest data partitions , even though this species does not appear to be associated with a rapid radiation . this result is not completely unexpected, as this species has previously been difficult to place phylogenetically  <cit> . an unequivocal resolution of this species will likely require the inclusion of multiple nuclear loci  <cit> .

when considering recent divergence, the disproportionately high mutation rate in ycf <dig>  demonstrated here is of importance, and mirrors findings in other plant taxa  <cit>  and recently in pinus subsection ponderosae  <cit> . these loci should be informative for phylogenetic studies in recently-diverged clades or in population-level studies in a range of plant species. discretion is advised, however, as ycf <dig>  appears to be a target of positive selection at least in pinus and may reflect adaptive episodes rather than neutral genealogies. in likelihood analyses of ycf <dig> and ycf <dig>  we observed several topological differences from the full alignment at the subsectional level, further demonstrating that caution must be taken in drawing phylogenetic conclusions from these two loci. although we were able to confidently score small structural changes  for all other exons, it was not possible to score indels for ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> due to the apparent high rate of indel formation in these loci. in all other loci examined, small structural changes only delineated clades with concurrent high support from nucleotide-based analyses , and thus are likely to be of limited use in species or population level discrimination. it is not clear whether this will also be the case in ycf <dig> and ycf <dig> 

it is reasonable to ask whether increased resolution is worth the effort of assembling whole plastomes. considering the conservative nature of bootstrap measures  <cit> , systematists often accept bootstrap values of ≥ 70% as reliable indicators of accurate topology  <cit> . simulation studies  <cit> , however, have demonstrated greatly increased accuracy  with bootstrap values ≥ 95% versus ≥ 70%, and the initial formulation of the phylogenetic bootstrap used ≥ 95% as the threshold for topological significance  <cit> . our results similarly support using a 95% bootstrap support cutoff for conclusive evidence as in both areas of topological differences, more than one clade received bootstrap support ≥ 70% by analysis of alternate data partitions. it is probable that conflicting topologies with ≥ 70% but < 95% bootstrap support accurately reflect data partitions yet may not represent the plastome phylogeny, and here the use of entire organelle genomes makes it possible to adopt more conservative criteria of nodal support. there are further biological reasons why an organellar phylogeny  may not accurately represent the organismal phylogeny; these include interspecific hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and stochastic properties of the coalescent process. nonetheless, phylogenetic reconstruction based on complete organellar sequences may facilitate the detection of such phenomena, by reducing errors and uncertainty due to insufficient sampling of dna sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
plastome sequencing is now a reasonable option for increasing resolution in phylogenetic studies at low taxonomic levels and will continue to become an increasingly simple process. as sequencers evolve to even higher capacity and multiplexing becomes routine in the near future, this will allow more extensive taxon and genomic sampling in phylogenetic studies at all taxonomic levels. it is estimated that sequencing capacity on next generation platforms will approach  <dig> gigabase pairs per sequencing run by the end of  <dig>  for perspective, this is sufficient sequence capacity to produce all  <dig> genus-level data sets used in our meta-analysis  at greater than 100× coverage depth in a single sequencing run. based on the estimates of cronn et al.  <cit> , this sequencing capacity would also allow the simultaneous sequencing of several thousands of animal mitochondria, which could greatly benefit low-level taxonomic or population-based studies in animals that currently tend to rely on relatively short sequences from many individuals  <cit> . it is also clear that these improvements could enable other pursuits that are currently hindered by limited sequencing capacity, such as identification of plants by diagnostic dna sequences . the recently agreed upon two locus chloroplast barcode for plants claims only 72% unique identification to species level <cit> . based on results herein, whole plastome sequences have the potential to be more highly discriminating and efficient plant dna barcodes; in fact, the possibility of plastome- and mitome-scale barcodes has been raised previously  <cit> . results in this area  will be impacted particularly if advances in target isolation and enrichment  <cit>  and streamlining sample preparation  <cit>  prove globally effective.
