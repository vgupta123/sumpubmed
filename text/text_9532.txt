BACKGROUND
in the brain development, neurons are assembled together via numerous synapses to build up complicated neuronal networks performing specific behaviors, such as transient or sporadic activity, synchronized bursting activity , and hyper-excitable activity. one of the most prominent behaviors in cortical networks is the synchronized bursting spikes occurring in the brain development and maturation  <cit> . the behavior is not only found in ex vivo cultured cortical networks  <cit>  but also in the brain regions of several in vivo animal models like visual cortex  <cit> , hippocampus  <cit> , and auditory neocortex  <cit> . in particular, under in vivo conditions, sba is considered highly related to a variety of crucial biophysical functions, such as attentional selection  <cit> , cognitive motor processes  <cit> , visual pattern recognition  <cit> , auditory object perception  <cit> .

although sba is an unique phenomenon in neuronal networks, characteristics of the neural networks causing sba remain unknown, in contrast to the study on the function significance of the sba  <cit> . presently, large random ex vivo cortical networks are more appropriate experimental model systems in the studies on the universal mechanisms governing the formation and conservation of neural network activities. experiments using ex vivo cultured neural networks have demonstrated that the adjustment of synaptic connections is highly correlated with the development of neuronal network behavior such as the evolution of spontaneous electrical activity  <cit> . in the matured phase of an ex vivo cultured neural network, each neuron builds up synaptic connections with 10-30% of other neurons within the neural network  <cit> . another line of evidence has indicated that the electrical activity of neurons can directly affect the outgrowth of neurites, and such reconfiguration of neuronal networks in turn causes adaptive adjustment of the neuronal electrical activity  <cit> . this behavior-dependent regulatory mechanism precisely drives and controls networks to grow, prune, and finally converge to a proper connective ratio  .

according to the above described connectivity characteristics of ex vivo cultured neural networks, two interesting questions arise: why do such a matured neural network keep its cr within a fixed range ; and what biological significance and associated implications does this fixed cr have? to answer these intriguing questions, we hypothesize that the cr is associated with the facilitation of synchronized bursting network behaviors, since synaptic connections are always found correlated with network behaviors in ex vivo experiments. spike response models  <cit>  were used to construct randomly connected artificial pulsed neural networks. the connective weights between two neurons were randomly selected, and the cr of the networks was increased progressively to mimic the process of development of cultured neural networks. the correlation between network behavior and structure was investigated using simulations. subjecting the simulations to parameter perturbations revealed that, for a network with an excitatory ratio  at 80-90% , the cr of the network always lies in a range of 10-30% when the occurrence of sba reaches its highest expectation. this value is consistent with the matured cr of ex vivo neuronal networks with the inhibitory synaptic ratio at 10-20%  <cit> . this result reveals that the networks are evolved to form such a cr for optimizing the occurrence of sba rather than randomly connected.

this study also explored the relationship between the occurrence of sba and the composition of network motifs in the neural networks  <cit> . we found that sba can be found only in the networks containing an all-positive-interaction feedback loop   <cit> . for networks containing apfls, the number of apfls also demonstrates an optimal range corresponding to the maximized occurrence of sba, close to the cr. thus, we infer that the apfl may serve a crucial network motif underlying to maximize the occurrence of sba.

for a pilot study in real neural networks, we have employed the neural network of nematode worm c. elegans  <cit> . the nervous system of c. elegans consists of  <dig> neurons and the number of neurons is almost same for different individuals. each neuron in c. elegans' nervous system has distinct properties in view of morphology, connectivity, and position, and therefore it can be labelled specifically. the neural network of c. elegans is highly clustered like regular lattices and also has small characteristic path lengths like random graphs. so, it is well represented by small-world networks  <cit> . we investigated the egg-laying circuit of c. elegans including  <dig> neurons or neuron classes to examine our major claims  <cit> . as a result, we found that the egg-laying circuit has  <dig> % cr and  <dig> % er which lie within the aforementioned evolved ranges. we also found that three two-node apfls included in this circuit contribute to inducing a much higher level of sbas in contrast to the randomly connected networks with the same number of network nodes.

RESULTS
the optimal cr at the maximal occurrence of sba
to unravel the biological significance of the cr of matured neural networks , we first investigated the relationships between cr, er, and the occurrence of sba. spike response models  can be used to simulate random ex vivo cortical networks so that their fundamental dynamical properties can be modeled  <cit> . the detailed simulation protocols for the artificial pulsed neural networks constructed by srm are introduced in the methods section. the connective weights among neurons were randomly assigned in a certain range to obtain a result that was irrelevant to the specific value of connective weights. for each cr and er,  <dig>  randomly connected pulsed neural networks were constructed to generate various network behaviors which were then further classified into four major categories with respect to the proposed criteria in the section entitled "the typical behaviors of spike neural networks".

the sba properties of networks were investigated at two different scales: small networks with  <dig> nodes and large networks with  <dig> nodes. we recorded and calculated the expectation and standard deviation of sba occurrence over the  <dig>  networks . figure  <dig> shows the relationships among cr, er, and the occurrence of sba in the 12-node networks  and the 60-node networks . the mean and standard deviation of the occurrence of sba were calculated over the  <dig>  spike neural networks in each possible combination of cr and er. the interesting profiles concerning the relationship between cr and the occurrence of sba are found when the er was equal to  <dig> , which coincides with the experimental observation in cultured neural networks  <cit> . figures  <dig> a- <dig> and b- <dig> show an optimal cr of 15% in the 12-node networks and 10% in the 60-node networks, respectively. this relation between cr and sba suggests that the direction of evolutionary selection of crs  is to maximize the possibility for synchronized bursting behavior by networks.

the optimal number of apfls causing maximal occurrence of sba
the existence of apfls was shown to be a prerequisite for inducing sba for  <dig>   <dig>  and 4-node pulsed neural networks  <cit> . srm simulations  indicated that only those networks containing apfls could produce sba. other networks containing only negative feedback loops or double-negative positive feedback loops  and those without any feedback loop, could not generate sba irrespective of synaptic efficacy. we were intrigued by these observations and further investigated the relationship between apfls and the occurrence of sba in larger-scale networks. figure  <dig> provides detailed descriptions of this relationship in both 12-node and 60-node networks. statistical tests on these relationships were carried out for all  <dig>  simulations on the same lattices, ers  × crs , shown in figure  <dig> a- <dig>  a- <dig> and figure  <dig> b- <dig>  b- <dig> 

figures  <dig> a- <dig> and a- <dig> show the correlation between two typical network behaviors, sba and hyper-excitable activity , and the total number of  <dig>   <dig>  and 4-node apfl motifs in 12-node pulsed neural networks . when the number of apfl motifs increases, the mean of sba occurrence initially increases, then reaches a peak , and finally returns to zero . however, the occurrence of hea always increased with the increase in the number of apfl motifs . if the number of apfls exceeded  <dig> in a 12-node network, the occurrence of 2-channel heas  approached the maximum, c <dig>  which corresponds to the case in which all pairs of channels are hyper-excitable. thus, the decreased the occurrence of sba can be explained by the increase of hea occurrence when apfls are sufficiently enriched in a network. a similar result was obtained in 60-node networks . the maximum 2-channel sba occurrence was  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> apfl motifs  in the 60-node networks. when the number of  <dig>   <dig>  4-node apfl motifs exceeded  <dig>  hea fully dominated, and all other behaviors including sba vanished from the 60-node networks. notably, the first points  in figures  <dig> a- <dig> and b- <dig> imply that no sba occurs when no apfl motif is present in the network. therefore, the apfls is necessary to trigger sba in a pulsed neural network.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> clearly indicate that sba occurs significantly within an optimal range of cr and apfl number. in fact, the simulations demonstrate that the number of apfl motifs increases along with the increase of er and cr in randomly generated synthetic networks . therefore, we infer that the primary factor inducing the maximal occurrence of sba may be the formation of a suitable number of apfls in neural networks.

the relationship between the number of  <dig>   <dig>  or 4-node apfls and the occurrence of sba
we also investigated the relationship between the distribution of each type of apfl and the level of sba. in the 12-node neural networks, we found that 2-node apfls are significantly enriched compared to 3-node or 4-node apfls for all levels of sba . figure  <dig> b- <dig> shows the relationship between the number of  <dig>   <dig>  or 4-node apfls and the occurrence of sba for 60-node pulsed neural networks. the number of 2-node apfls significantly exceeds the number of 3-node or 4-node apfls only when the occurrence of sba exceeds a high level . therefore, the number of 2-node apfls dominates the total number of apfls subject to a high level of sba occurrence in both small- and large-scale networks.

how is sba inhibited when each type of apfl motif is absent from the pulsed neural networks? figure  <dig> a- <dig> shows the occurrence of sba when one type or a combination of apfl motifs is not present in the 12-node networks. with the exclusion of more types of apfl motifs, both the mean and standard deviation approached zero. for example, if we take the absence of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6-node apfls into account, the occurrence of sba is only  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ±  <dig>  . thus, the loss of more types of apfl motif gradually inhibits the occurrence of sba. in 60-node networks, the observed trend slightly differs in that the exclusion of 2-node apfls completely prohibits the occurrence of sba . this fact implies that 2-node apfls may function dominantly in the inhibition of sba in large-scale networks, compared with 3-node and 4-node apfls.

a case study of the egg-laying circuit of c. elegans
we investigated the egg-laying circuit of c. elegans composed of  <dig> neurons or neuron classes for a pilot study of real neural networks  <cit> . we identified that this circuit contains three two-node apfls as indicated by the bi-directional red arrows . in addition, we found that the cr of this circuit is  <dig> % and the er of it is  <dig> %.

we carried out simulations over two network groups for  <dig>  times with different synaptic weight perturbations. one group of networks are randomly connected with any cr between  <dig> and  <dig>  and the other group of networks have the same topological structure as shown in figure  <dig>  two-sample t-test was carried out for these two groups to examine whether the real biological neural network induce higher sbas compared to the randomly connected neural networks. details are as follows: let vector x denote the sbas of  <dig>  randomly connected networks and vector y represent the sbas of the egg-laying neural network of c. elegans with the  <dig>  synaptic weight perturbations. assuming that the variances of x and y are unknown, it becomes the behrens-fisher problem  <cit> . the t-test statistic is t=x¯-ȳsx2/nx+sy2/ny ~t where sx =  <dig>  and sy =  <dig>  are the standard deviations of x and y; x¯= <dig>  and ȳ =  <dig>  are the means of x and y; nx and ny are the numbers of data of x and y. the p-value for the null hypothesis h0:x¯≥ȳ is less than  <dig>  which is much less than the significance level α =  <dig> . therefore, the null hypothesis h <dig> should be rejected and the alternative is accepted.

discussion
the present study unraveled the direction of neural network development to facilitate a relatively high level of sba. thus, the cr range of a mature cultured neural network may represent a delicate design and not the result of random selection. in addition, such biological interpretation of the optimal cr may be further applicable to in vivo situations, since the distribution of cell types in ex vivo networks is often similar to those found in vivo  <cit> . some evidence indicates that neural networks first develop toward certain connective structures and then form specific functions by adjusting their synaptic efficacies according to the external stimulus  <cit> . our simulations suggest that neurons may connect with each other at a 10-30% cr to achieve the highest possibility of sba occurrence in the early stage, and then, based on such an optimal cr range, the constructed networks further recruit and control sba by chemically adjusting their synaptic efficacies.

we showed that our main results are quite robust to variations of network scales, network topological properties, and simulation parameters. we carried out simulations  for a variety of neural networks with 10- <dig> nodes and found that the mean value of all the optimal crs is 13%  which lies within the evolutionarily selected range of cr . in addition, note that the networks used for simulations in the early part  were based on random connections and therefore various possible topological structures were already taken into account. so, we confirmed that our results hold regardless of particular connective forms. we have also investigated the possible influences by perturbation of parameters {τs, τm, Δax, τ} . for instance, the mean of all the optimal crs for 10-node networks with the parameter perturbations was  <dig> % . in this way, we could also confirm that our results, the evolutionarily selected range of cr of 10-30%, still hold against the parameter perturbations.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the underlying cause of the evolutionarily selected crs of neural networks. artificial pulsed neural network simulation has shown that an optimal cr range  maximizes the occurrence of synchronized bursting behaviors , which is consistent with previous ex vivo experimental observation, in which the crs of cultured cortical networks consistently lie in a range of 10-30% with an er of 80-90%.

employing time-series data from multi-electrode array experiments, we identified some apfl motifs in cultured cortical networks of e <dig> sprague-dawley rats  <cit> . to further unravel the crucial role of the apfl motifs, we investigated the relationship between specific network structures  and network behaviors in artificial pulsed neural networks. this study can readily be used to capture the fundamental dynamical characteristics of cultured neural networks. we found that the existence of apfl motifs is a necessary condition of sba, not only for small-scale networks but also for large-scale networks. to recruit a high level of sba, networks must have an optimal number of apfl motifs. therefore, we infer that the formation of the appropriate number of apfls is related to the maximal occurrence of sba, whereas the optimal cr is only a necessary condition to achieve the required apfls.

furthermore, we investigated the distribution of each type of apfl motif  at different sba levels. in both 12-node and 60-node networks, the 2-node apfl motif dominated among apfl motifs at high sba levels. more importantly, the contribution of each type of apfl motif to sba was demonstrated by comparing the inhibitory effect of each apfl motif against sba. for large-scale networks, the exclusion of 2-node apfls almost fully prohibits the occurrence of sba, implying that compared to other apfl motifs, 2-node apfl motifs may be crucial for neural networks to produce sba.
