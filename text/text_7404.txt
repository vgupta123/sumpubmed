BACKGROUND
pseudomonas syringae is a widespread bacterial pathogen that causes disease on a broad range of economically important plant species. the species p. syringae is sub-divided into about  <dig> pathovars, each exhibiting characteristic disease symptoms and distinct host-specificities. p. syringae pathovar tabaci  causes wild-fire disease in soybean and tobacco plants  <cit> , characterised by chlorotic halos surrounding necrotic spots on the leaves of infected plants. formation of halos is dependent on the beta-lactam tabtoxin, which causes ammonia accumulation in the host cell by inhibition of glutamine synthetase  <cit> . however, whether tabtoxin is an essential component of the disease process is unclear  <cit> .

pathogenicity of p. syringae strains is dependent on the type iii secretion system . the t3ss secretes a suite of virulence 'effector' proteins into the host cytoplasm where they subvert the eukaryotic cell physiology and disrupt host defences  <cit> . mutants lacking the t3ss do not secrete effectors, and as a consequence do not infect plants or induce disease symptoms. thus, understanding effector action is central to understanding bacterial pathogenesis. a single p. syringae strain typically encodes about  <dig> different effectors  <cit> . however, different p. syringae strains have different complements of effector genes. the emerging view is that of a core of common effectors encoded by most strains, augmented by a variable set. individual effectors appear to act redundantly with each other and are individually dispensable with a small or no loss to pathogen virulence  <cit> . effectors are also thought to play an important role in determining host range. this is most clearly true when infections are restricted by host defences. some plants have evolved specific mechanisms to recognise certain effectors; such recognition induces strong host defences which curtail infection. for example, expression of the t3ss effector hopq1- <dig> from p. syringae pathovar tomato  dc <dig> was sufficient to render pta  <dig> avirulent on nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> . the opposite situation, in which acquisition of a novel effector gene confers the ability to infect new host plants, has not been demonstrated and remains speculative. however, heterologous expression of the effector gene avrptob conferred a plasmid-cured strain of p. syringae pathovar phaseolicola  with increased virulence  <cit> . we hope that further identification and characterisation of effector repertoires of particular strains will shine new light on their roles in determining host range. finally, bacterial virulence is also likely to be influenced by other non-t3ss-dependent virulence factors such as toxins which are often co-regulated with the t3ss  <cit> .

complete genome sequences are available for strains representing three p. syringae pathovars: pto, pathovar phaseolicola  and pathovar syringae   <cit> . comparisons of these have led to the identification of core effector gene sets and to explain some of the differences in host-specificity between pathovars. however, these three sequenced strains are representatives of three distinct phylogroups within the species p. syringae, and as such are phylogenetically quite distant  <cit> . according to dna-dna hybridisation studies and ribotyping  <cit> , p. syringae can be divided into  <dig> discrete genomospecies. representative strains of psy, pph and pto fell into genomospecies one, two and three respectively  <cit> . recently, a strain of pathovar oryzae  was sequenced  <cit> . a draft genome sequence was also published for pto t <dig>  <cit> , a strain closely related to pto dc <dig> but restricted to tomato hosts, whereas pto dc <dig> is able to cause disease on arabidopsis. in the current study, we explore genetic differences at an intermediate phylogenetic resolution; that is, we compared the genome sequences of pta  <dig> to that of p. phaseolicola  1448a, which resides within the same phylogroup but possesses a distinct host range and causes different disease symptoms.

pto dc <dig> was the first plant-pathogenic pseudomonad to have its genome sequenced, helping to establish the arabidopsis-pto system as the primary model for plant-microbe interactions. however, arabidopsis is not a natural host of pto, and it is important to develop alternative systems given the genetic variability of p. syringae strains, particularly in regard to effectors. we work on the interaction between pta and the wild tobacco plant n. benthamiana, which offers certain advantages over arabidopsis. firstly, n. benthamiana is an important model for the solanaceae, which includes many important crop species. the pta-n. benthamiana interaction is a natural pathosystem. lastly, n. benthamiana is an important model plant that is more amenable to biochemistry-based approaches and facile manipulation of gene expression such as virus-induced gene silencing . thus n. benthamiana provides experimental options for understanding plant-bacterial interactions. strains of pta can cause disease on n. benthamiana, but relatively few genetic sequence data are available for this pathovar.

in this study we generated a draft complete genome sequence of pta  <dig> and used a functional screen for hrpl-dependent genes to infer its repertoire of t3ss effectors and associated hrp outer proteins , which differs significantly from that of its closest relative whose complete genome has previously been published . pta  <dig> does not encode functional homologues of hopaf <dig> or hrpz <dig>  this was surprising since hopaf <dig> was conserved in the three previously sequenced pathovars  <cit> . hrpz <dig> is conserved in most strains of p. syringae that have been investigated, albeit with differences in amino acid sequence  <cit> . however, pta strain  <dig> and several other isolates from japan, were previously shown to carry a major deletion leading to truncated hrpz protein product  <cit> . pta  <dig> encodes several novel potential t3ss effectors for which no close orthologues have been reported. we also discovered several large genomic regions in pta  <dig> that do not share detectable nucleotide sequence similarity with previously sequenced pseudomonas genomes. these regions may be horizontally acquired islands that possibly contribute to pathogenicity or epiphytic fitness of pta  <dig> 

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of the pta  <dig> genome
the illumina sequencing platform provides a cost-effective and rapid means to generate nucleotide sequence data  <cit> . although this method generates very short sequence reads, several recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to assemble these short reads into good quality draft genome sequences  <cit> .

we generated  <dig> , <dig> pairs of 36-nucleotide reads for a total of  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides. this represents approximately 145x depth of coverage assuming a genome size of six megabases. we used velvet  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to assemble the reads de novo. our resulting assembly had  <dig> supercontigs of mean length  <dig>  nucleotides, an n <dig> number of eight, and n <dig> length of  <dig>  nucleotides; that is, the eight longest supercontigs were all at least  <dig>  nucleotides long and together covered more than 50% of the predicted genome size of six megabases. the largest supercontig was  <dig>  nucleotides long. the total length of the  <dig> assembled supercontigs was  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides. the g+c content of the assembly was  <dig> %, similar to that of the previously sequenced p. syringae genomes . the sequence data from this project have been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession achu <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version, achu <dig>  the data can also be accessed from the authors' website  and as additional files submitted with this manuscript. in addition, an interactive genome browser is available from the authors' website .

percentage identities were calculated over the alignable portion of the genomes using mummer  <cit> .

we aligned the  <dig> pta supercontigs against published complete pseudomonas genome sequences using mummer  <cit> . the pta  <dig> genome was most similar to that of pph 1448a, with  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity over the alignable portions. the next most similar genome was that of pto dc <dig>  with less than 90% identity . this pattern of sequence similarity is consistent with phylogenetic studies that placed strains of pta in the same phylogroup as pph and revealed a relatively distant relationship to pto  <cit> .

comparison of the protein complement of pta  <dig> versus pph 1448a and other pseudomonads
using the fgenesb annotation pipeline , we identified  <dig>  potential protein-coding genes, of which  <dig>  were predicted to encode proteins of at least  <dig> amino acids long. of  <dig>  predicted pta  <dig> proteins,  <dig>  had no detectable homology with pph 1448a proteins . of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> had no detectable homologues in psy b728a nor pto dc <dig>  these  <dig> pta-specific sequences had a median length of  <dig> amino acids whereas the median length of the  <dig>  sequences was  <dig> amino acids. automated gene prediction is not infallible and inevitably a subset of the predictions will be incorrect. the reliability of gene predictions is poorer for short sequences than for longer ones. this slight enrichment for very short sequences among the pta-specific gene predictions might be explained by the inclusion of some open reading frames that are not functional genes among those  <dig>  however, many of the predicted proteins showed significant similarity to other proteins in the ncbi nr databases , confirming that these are likely to be genuine conserved genes.

conservation of the t3ss apparatus and t3ss-dependent effectors
the hop database  provides a catalogue of confirmed and predicted hop genes  <cit> . figure  <dig> lists the hop genes in hopdb for the three previously fully sequenced p. syringae genomes. a 'core' set of hop genes are conserved in all three previously sequenced pathovars: avre <dig>  hopaf <dig>  hopah <dig>  hopaj <dig>  hopak <dig>  hopan <dig>  hopi <dig>  hopj <dig>  hopx <dig>  hrpk <dig>  hrpw <dig> and hrpz <dig>  in addition to this core set, each genome contains additional hop genes that are found in only a subset of the sequenced strains. the pta  <dig> homologues of hop genes are listed in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> also indicates those hop genes for which a close homologue was found to be encoded in pta  <dig> 

the locations of pph 1448a homologous genes is indicated, including an indication of whether they are located on the chromosome or on the large plasmid. also indicated is whether each gene appeared in the functional screen for hrp-dependent transcription.

in sequenced strains of p. syringae, the gene cluster encoding the t3ss apparatus is flanked by collections of effector genes termed the exchangeable effector locus  and the conserved effector locus . together, these three genetic components comprise the hrp pathogenicity island  <cit> . a core set of hop genes is located in the hrp pathogenicity island  <cit> , which is highly conserved between pta  <dig> and pph 1448a , except that in pta  <dig> there is a deletion in hrpz <dig> and an insertion in the hrpv-hrcu intergenic region. the core hop genes avre <dig>  hopah <dig>  hopaj <dig>  hopak <dig>  hopan <dig>  hopi <dig>  hopj <dig>  hopx <dig> and hrpk <dig> are conserved in pta  <dig> and encode intact full-length proteins. pta  <dig> encodes a full-length hrpw <dig> protein, albeit with insertions of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides relative to the pph 1448a sequence. however, there is a large deletion in hrpz <dig> that likely renders it non-functional and hopaf <dig> is completely absent.

besides the core conserved hop genes, the pta  <dig> genome assembly contains full-length orthologues of hopr <dig>  hopas <dig>  hopae <dig> and hopv <dig>  which are also found in pph 1448a but are absent from psy b728a and/or pto dc <dig> 

the hrpz <dig> gene encodes a harpin, which is not classified as a type iii effector because it is not injected directly into host cells. harpins are characteristically acidic, heat-stable and enriched for glycine, lack cysteine residues  <cit>  and can induce defences in both host and non-host plants  <cit> . hrpz <dig> forms pores in the host membrane  <cit>  suggesting a role in translocation of effectors across the host membrane. it also shows sequence-specific protein binding activity  <cit> . hrpz <dig> can induce defences in both host and non-host plants and tobacco has been extensively used as the non-host plant species  <cit> . the inactivation of hrpz <dig> in pta  <dig> and other strains of pta  <cit>  may be an adaptive strategy and have been an important process in the stepwise progression towards compatibility, allowing pta  <dig> to avoid detection by the tobacco host plant. this is reminiscent of the "black holes" and other processes that inactivate genes whose expressed products are detrimental to a pathogenic lifestyle  <cit> . one excellent example is the inactivation of cada in genomes of shigella species as compared to the genome of their closely related but non-pathogenic escherichia coli strain  <cit> .

pta  <dig> contains highly conserved homologues of hopab <dig>  hopw, hopo1- <dig>  hopt1- <dig>  hopag <dig>  hopah <dig>  hopf <dig> and hopar <dig>  which are absent in pph 1448a. although absent from the pph 1448a genome, hopar <dig> and hopf <dig> have been identified in other strains of pph  <cit> . in pph 1302a, hopar <dig> is located on the pathogenicity island pphgi- <dig>  though its genomic location varies between strains  <cit> . pphgi- <dig> is absent from the pph 1448a genome  <cit> . the pta  <dig> genome  possesses a region of similarity to ptphgi- <dig>  but which contains a substantial number of insertions and deletions . the pta  <dig> hopar <dig> homologue  is not located in the pphgi- <dig> region; it falls on supercontig  <dig> about two kilobases upstream of a gene encoding a protein  sharing 43% amino acid identity with pto dc <dig> avrpto <dig>  in contrast to avrpto <dig> from pto dc <dig>  the avrpto <dig> homologue  from pta  <dig> is not recognised by the plant pto/prf system .

the homologues of hopag <dig>  hopah <dig> and the degenerate hopai1' are found within a region of the pta  <dig> genome that shares synteny with the chromosome of psy b728a. this region is also conserved in pto dc3000a, albeit with several deletions and insertions, suggesting that these effector genes are ancestral to the divergence of the pathovars and have been lost in pph 1448a rather than having been laterally transferred laterally between pta  <dig> and psy b728a. in pto dc <dig>  hopag <dig>  has been disrupted by an insertion sequence  element. this is consistent with a model of lineage-specific loss of certain ancestral effectors.

in pto dc <dig>  hopo1- <dig> and hopt1- <dig> are located on the large plasmid pdc3000a; homologues of these effector-encoding genes are not found in pph 1448a. the pta  <dig> genome contains a three kilobase region of homology to pdc <dig> comprising homologues of these two effector genes and a homologue of the shco <dig> chaperone-encoding gene. these three genes are situated in a large  region of the pta  <dig> genome that has only limited sequence similarity with pph 1448a. two trna genes  are located at the boundary of this region , which would be consistent with this comprising a mobile island.

in plasmid pma4326b from p. syringae pathovar maculicola , the hopw <dig> effector gene is immediately adjacent to a three-gene cassette comprising a resolvase, an integrase and exea. this cassette is also found in plasmids and chromosomes of several human-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . we found a homologue of this cassette along with a hopw <dig> homologue on supercontig  <dig> of the pta  <dig> genome assembly. stavrinides and guttman  <cit>  proposed that the boundaries of the cassette lay upstream of the resolvase and upstream of hopw <dig>  the presence of this four-gene unit in a completely different location in pta  <dig> is indeed consistent with the hypothesis that it represents a discrete mobile unit.

several hop genes are located on the large plasmid of pph 1448a. we found no homologues of these genes in pta  <dig>  suggesting that the plasmid is not present in pta  <dig>  consistent with this, only a small proportion of the plasmid was alignable to our 36-nucleotide illumina sequence reads . this reveals that a large component of the pathogen's effector arsenal is determined by its complement of plasmids. however, simple loss or gain of a plasmid does not explain all of the differences in effector complement since pta  <dig> lacks homologues of several pph 1448a chromosomally-located effector-encoding hop genes hopg <dig>  hopaf <dig>  avrb <dig>  hopf <dig> and hopat <dig> as well as the non-effector hopaj <dig>  it also lacks homologues of the pph 1448a degenerate effector gene hopab3'.

the regions of the pph 1448a large plasmid that are apparently conserved in pta  <dig> include genes encoding the conjugal transfer system, suggesting the presence of one or more plasmids in this strain. we found an open reading frame  encoding a protein with about 97% sequence identity to the repa proteins characteristically encoded on pt23a-family plasmids , suggesting that this  <dig> kilobase supercontig might represent a plasmid.

a functional screen for hrpl-regulated genes
we used a previously described functional screen  <cit>  to complement our bioinformatics-based searches for type iii effectors of pta  <dig>  our functional screen was based on two steps. the first step was employed to identify genes whose expression was regulated by the t3ss alternative sigma factor, hrpl. the second step was used to identify the subset of hrpl-regulated genes that encoded effectors. for pta  <dig>  we employed only the first step to identify candidate effector genes based on induced expression by hrpl. a library was constructed from pta  <dig> into a broad-host range vector carrying a promoter-less gfp and mobilized into pto lacking its endogenous hrpl but conditionally complemented with an arabinose-inducible hrpl. we used a fluorescence activated cell sorter  to select clones that carried hrpl-inducible promoters based on expression of gfp after growth in arabinose. clones were sequenced and sequences were assembled. clones representative of assembled supercontigs were verified again for hrpl regulation using facs. among the genes whose expression was confirmed to be hrpl-dependent were those encoding effectors hopae <dig>  hopi <dig>  hopar <dig>  the avrpto1-like gene, hopf <dig>  hopt1- <dig>  hopo1- <dig>  avre <dig>  hopx <dig>  and the degenerate hopm1' and hopai1' as well as known t3ss-associated genes hrph  and hrpw <dig>  interestingly, the screen also confirmed hrpl-dependent regulation of genes encoding a major facilitator superfamily  permease and a putative peptidase .

other differences in predicted proteomes of p. syringae strains
host range and pathogenicity are likely to be further influenced by genes other than those associated with type iii secretion. virulence determinants in p. syringae include toxins as well as epiphytic fitness; that is, the ability to acquire nutrients and survive on the leaf surface  <cit> . epiphytic fitness depends on quorum-sensing  <cit> , chemotaxis  <cit> , osmo-protection, extracellular polysaccharides, glycosylation of extracellular structures  <cit>  iron uptake  <cit>  and the ability to form biofilms. cell-wall-degrading hydrolytic enzymes play a role in virulence in at least some plant-pathogenic pseudomonads  <cit> ). secretion systems  may also contribute to both virulence and epiphytic fitness  <cit> , whilst multidrug efflux pumps may confer resistance to plant-derived antimicrobials  <cit> .

to identify differences between pta  <dig> and the previously sequenced pph 1448a, psy b728a and pto dc <dig> with respect to their repertoires of virulence factors, we performed blastp searches between the predicted proteomes. we found no significant differences in the repertoires of secretion systems between the proteomes. however, we found that pta  <dig> lacks homologues of several pph 1448a polysaccharide modifying enzymes . conversely, pta  <dig> encodes two glycosyl transferases  and a thermostable glycosylase  that do not have homologues in any of the three fully sequenced p. syringae genomes. this may imply differences in the extracellular polysaccharide profiles. in contrast to pph 1448a, pta  <dig> lacks homologues of rhsa insecticidal toxins . however, a tabtoxin biosynthesis gene cluster is found in the pta  <dig> genome and shows a high degree of conservation with the previously sequenced pta br <dig> tabtoxin biosynthesis cluster  <cit> .

pta  <dig> encodes several enzymes that do not have homologues in any of the three fully sequenced p. syringae genomes , including a predicted gluconolactonase , a predicted dienelactone hydrolase , a predicted nitroreductase , and a sulphotransferase . c1e_ <dig> shares  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity with a predicted epoxide hydrolase  from granulibacter bethesdensis cgdnih <dig>  <cit>  and has a significant match to the epoxide hydrolase n-terminal domain in the pfam database   <cit> . epoxide hydrolases are found in p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens pfo- <dig>  but not in any other pseudomonads. it is possible that this gene product has a function in detoxification of host-derived secondary metabolites.

protein-coding genes were predicted and automatically annotated using the fgenesb pipeline . only those proteins are shown for which a predicted function could be proposed.

pta protein c1e_ <dig> has a significant match to the sulphotransferase domain . examples of this protein domain have not been found in other pseudomonads except for p. fluorescens pfo- <dig>  sulphotransferase proteins include flavonyl 3-sulphotransferase, aryl sulphotransferase, alcohol sulphotransferase, estrogen sulphotransferase and phenol-sulphating phenol sulphotransferase. these enzymes are responsible for the transfer of sulphate groups to specific compounds. the sulphotransferase gene  overlaps a two kilobase pta 11528-specific genomic island that also encodes a phage tail collar-protein encoding gene  and an acetyltransferase . we speculate that this region has been horizontally acquired in the pta  <dig> lineage via a bacteriophage.

an  <dig> kilobase region of pta  <dig> supercontig  <dig> contains two open reading frames   whose respective predicted protein products show  <dig> and 55% amino acid identity to the c- and n-termini of a p. putida methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein   and little similarity to any p. syringae protein. since the n- and c-termini are divided into separate reading frames, this probably represents a degenerate pseudogene. immediately downstream of these orfs is a gene  that specifies a mcp showing greatest sequence identity  to pp_ <dig> from p. putida, whilst sharing only 65% identity to its closest homologue in p. syringae . this region also encodes another mcp  that shares only 50% amino acid identity with any previously sequenced p. syringae homologue. it remains to be tested whether these mcps play a role in pathogenesis and/or epiphytic fitness.

transcriptional regulators are not normally considered to be virulence factors. however, expression of virulence factors may be coordinated by and dependent on regulators. moreover, heterologous expression of the rscs regulator was recently shown to be sufficient to transform a fish symbiont into a squid symbiont  <cit> . pta  <dig> encodes several predicted transcriptional regulators that are not found in pto dc <dig>  psy b728a and pph 1448a. these include two predicted tetr-like proteins , two predicted xenobiotic response element proteins , a laci-like protein , a cro/ci family protein  and an iclr family protein .

pta  <dig> encodes a novel pilin  not found in previously sequenced p. syringae strains but sharing significant sequence similarity with a type iv pilin from p. aeruginosa  <cit> . pilin is the major protein component of the type iv pili, which have functions in forming micro-colonies and biofilms, host-cell adhesion, signalling, phage-attachment, dna uptake and surface motility, and have been implicated as virulence factors in animal-pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the precise function of the c1e_ <dig> pilin is unknown but it may be involved in epiphytic fitness or plant-pathogenesis or could even be involved in an interaction with an insect vector.

pta-specific genomic islands
we identified  <dig> genomic regions of at least one kilobase in length which gave no blastn matches against previously sequenced pseudomonas genomes . ten of the pta 11528-specific regions are longer than  <dig> kilobases, the longest being  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kilobases. the  <dig>  kilobase region corresponds to the tabtoxin biosynthesis gene cluster  <cit> . these regions will be good candidates for further study of the genetic basis for association of pta with the tobacco host. for example, several of the islands encode mfs transporters and other efflux proteins that might be involved in protection from plant-derived antimicrobials .

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a draft complete genome sequence for the pta  <dig> a pathogen that naturally causes disease in wild tobacco, an important model system for studying plant disease and immunity. from this sequence, combined with a functional screen, we were able to deduce the pathogen's repertoire of t3ss-associated hop proteins. this has revealed some important differences between pta and other pathovars with respect to the arsenal of t3ss effectors at their disposal for use against the host plant. we also revealed more than a hundred pta-specific genomic regions that are not conserved in any other sequenced p. syringae, providing many potential leads for the further study of the pta-tobacco disease system.
