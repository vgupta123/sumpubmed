BACKGROUND
the amphibian ovarian oocyte is blocked in first meiotic prophase until a transient rise in gonadotropin stimulates its surrounding follicle cells to release progesterone  <cit> , which binds to the first external loop of the catalytic subunit of the na//k-atpase at the oocyte surface to reinitiate the meiotic divisions  <cit> . the oocytes then complete one and one-half meiotic divisions, are released from the ovarian follicle, and become blocked at second meiotic metaphase. sperm penetration results in the completion of meiosis followed by a period of rapid mitoses characteristic of the developing blastula. rana pipiens ovaries contain a single population of mature oocytes that respond to gonadotropin, in contrast to the multiple growth stages seen in xenopus laevis when maintained under laboratory conditions  <cit> .

our previous studies with rana pipiens oocytes showed that, in vivo, gonadotropin induces phosphorylation of the yolk protein, phosvitin, and that the release of the metaphase block by fertilization and the subsequent synchronous cell divisions coincide with stepwise phosvitin dephosphorylation  <cit> . in the present study, we have analyzed changes and turnover in high energy phosphates during the meiotic divisions using 31p nmr and 32po <dig> pulse labeling techniques in vitro. rana pipiens oocytes are excellent experimental material for noninvasive nmr studies of cell division because of their large size and the ease of superfusion in an nmr tube, which maintains physiological oxygen levels. oocytes from each female undergo synchronous meiotic divisions. the prophase-arrested  oocytes maintain a sizeable pool of high energy phosphate compounds, including phosphocreatine , atp and serine-rich phosphoproteins, for at least  <dig> h during superfusion  <cit> .

little has been published about the compartmentation or turnover of high energy phosphates within oocytes or the bioenergetic changes during meiotic division. using 31p-nmr and the saturation transfer technique, we have examined the effect of the physiological meiotic inducer  on both the forward pcr → atp and the reverse atp → pcr rates of the creatine kinase reaction in rana oocytes during the first meiotic division. the 31p-nmr measurements were correlated with in vitro 32po <dig> turnover using pulse labeling techniques in oocytes  undergoing synchronous meiotic divisions.

we find that in vitro progesterone initiates an increase in phosphoryl potential and that phosphorylation of the yolk protein phosvitin is accompanied by internalization of the ouabain-sensitive na/k-atpase and plasma membrane depolarization. this indicates that a progesterone-induced shift in high energy phosphate utilization from cation pump to phosvitin phosphorylation is necessary for completing the meiotic divisions and early development.

RESULTS
intracellular environment of the prophase rana pipiens oocyte
the ultrastructure of yolk platelets from rana oocytes consists of a central main body with a crystalline lattice structure, with an enclosing membrane approximately  <dig> Å in thickness  <cit> . electron micrographs of the main body reveal hexagonal net, square net and parallel band patterns. the lipoprotein complex, vitellogen, contains 12% lipid and smaller amounts of carbohydrates and biliverdin  <cit> . fluorescence confocal microscopy, using a ph-sensitive fluorescent dye, indicates that the mature yolk platelets are acidic   <cit> . as shown previously, about 85% of the rana pipiens oocyte dry weight is recovered with the yolk platelet fraction isolated by differential centrifugation of  <dig>  m sucrose homogenates  <cit> .

31p-nmr analysis of high energy phosphate turnover
the 31p-nmr spectrum of rana pipiens follicles is shown in figure  <dig>  the outstanding feature of the 31p-nmr spectra of frog oocytes is the resonance of the yolk phosphoprotein, with additional resonances for phosphocreatine  and the α, β and γ phosphoryl groups of atp . the resonance of the intracellular inorganic phosphate is buried under the large yolk phosphoprotein signal and is totally unobservable, even in the form of a shoulder riding on the large peak. use of the convolution difference technique alone  is useful for resolving creatine phosphate, and the α, β, and γ resonances of atp, although insufficient to resolve the pi peak. techniques based on differential relaxation properties of the narrow pi resonance have been used for observing and defining the position of the intracellular pi resonance  <cit> . saturation transfer experiments were carried out by application of a low power rf pulse for a time of 3t <dig> to either the γatp or pcr resonance. control spectra were obtained by positioning the saturating pulse symmetrically on the other side of pcr or γatp, respectively .

the difference spectrum showing transfer of saturation from γatp to pcr resonance is illustrated in the upper panel  of figure  <dig>  whereas that for reverse transfer from pcr to γatp is shown in the lower panel. after saturation of the γatp resonance there was a 19% transfer of saturation to the pcr resonance. the t <dig> of pcr resonance measured in the presence of the saturation of γatp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec which, using theoretical formulation  <cit> , yielded a pseudo first order rate constant  for the pcr → atp reaction of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec- <dig>  the pcr concentration of the prophase oocyte was measured to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  giving a forward flux of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm/sec. however, when pcr was saturated, there was no detectable transfer of saturation to γatp in the difference spectrum. this may reflect compartmentation of atp in non-cytosolic compartments  <cit> .

progesterone stimulation of protein phosphorylation in rana oocytes
the upper panel of figure  <dig> compares 32po <dig> uptake from the medium by control and progesterone-treated rana ovarian follicles, expressed as moles/liter of oocyte water. extracellular inorganic po <dig> levels were maintained at  <dig> μm. uptake was essentially identical in control and progesterone-treated oocytes during the first  <dig> h, but markedly increased in progesterone-treated oocytes prior to the onset of nuclear membrane breakdown, continuing to rise even after completion of the membrane dissolution. the lower panel of figure  <dig> compares 32po <dig> incorporation into the tca precipitable components of the control and progesterone-treated oocytes shown in the upper panel. in progesterone-treated oocytes,  <dig> ± 2%  of the total 32po <dig> taken up is incorporated into total protein, phospholipid and nucleic acid components by completion of nuclear membrane breakdown, compared to  <dig> ± 1%  incorporation in control oocytes over the same time period.

since the major increase in protein phosphorylation occurred after  <dig> -  <dig> h exposure to inducing levels of progesterone , isolated follicles were preincubated in ringer's solution containing  <dig>  μm progesterone for  <dig> h, then pulse labeled with ringer's solution containing 32po <dig> and  <dig>  μm progesterone for  <dig> h. the oocytes were rinsed, homogenized at ice-bath temperatures and phosvitin isolated as described in methods. table  <dig> compares 32po <dig> uptake into purified phosvitin in control and progesterone-stimulated follicles. a  <dig> fold increase in 32po <dig> incorporation was observed in phosvitin isolated from progesterone-treated follicles. compared to the controls,  <dig>  μm progesterone produced a  <dig> ± 4%  increase in phosvitin phosphate, based on phosphate analysis  <cit> .

aisolated ovarian follicles were preincubated in ringer's solution with or without  <dig>  jau progesterone for  <dig> h at 22°c,  added, and then further incubated for  <dig> h. bmean ± sd  denuded oocytes and/or isolated ovarian follicles from  <dig> hibernating rana pipiens females.

structure of phosvitin in amphibians
phosvitin is the principal phosphoprotein in the eggs of numerous vertebrates . in xenopus laevis, a species closely related to rana pipiens, phosvitin is one of three chains in the protein complex called vitellogenin-a <dig> . the protein structure prediction server   <cit>  was used to examine the secondary structure of the serine-rich phosvitin sequence . as shown in figure  <dig>  the predicted structure was relatively complex, with  <dig> α-helixes. going from the n- to c-terminal ends, the sequence contains blocks of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> serine residues. serines are generally excluded from helix-containing regions. thus, each phosvitin molecule contains at least  <dig> serine residues as possible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation sites. based on our data, it appears that progesterone selectively stimulates phosphorylation of about one of every  <dig> serines.

discussion
the results presented here and elsewhere  <cit>  indicate that progesterone binding to the catalytic subunit of the na/k-atpase at the oocyte plasma membrane initiates a sequence of changes in high energy phosphate compounds during the first meiotic division. in rana pipiens oocytes, breakdown of the nuclear membrane occurs 8- <dig> hours after exposure to inducing levels of progesterone, followed by arrest at second meiotic metaphase at 15- <dig> hours . an 80% increase in pcr precedes nuclear membrane breakdown accompanied by a marked decrease in pseudo first order rate constant  for the pcr → atp reaction . this increase in phosphoryl potential coincides with an increased phosphorylation of the phosphate-rich yolk protein, phosvitin, beginning at the onset of nuclear membrane breakdown .

changes in atp utilization and plasma membrane surface area during the meiotic divisions
the decrease in kf shown in figure  <dig> indicates a drop in cytosolic adp concentration and an increase in the cytosolic phosphoryl potential of the oocyte prior to nuclear membrane breakdown . the decreased availability of adp, normally generated in large part by hydrolysis of atp during ion-transport by na/k-atpase, could arise from the observed internalization of the plasma membrane na/k-atpase  over the same time period  <cit> . this seems probable, based on our data showing a simultaneous  <dig> - 60% decrease in membrane capacitance , increased endocytosis  <cit> , and the disappearance of more than 95% of the high affinity ouabain binding sites in progesterone-treated denuded rana pipiens oocytes over the same time period  <cit> .

ouabain specifically binds to the α-subunit of the na/k-atpase . by  <dig> h the ouabain is recovered bound to intracellular vesicles of progesterone-treated oocytes; it does not diffuse out of the progesterone-treated denuded oocytes  <cit> . both scanning  <cit>  and transmission  electron micrographs indicate that the prophase oocyte is covered with numerous microvilli. estimates of the surface area in control oocytes reveal that the microvilli increase the oocyte surface area 10- <dig> times compared with that of a sphere of the same diameter  <cit> . scanning electron micrographs reveal that the microvilli of progesterone-treated oocytes disappear coincident with the decrease in membrane capacitance, leaving only stumps on the oocyte surface  <cit> .

phosphorylation of yolk platelet phosvitin
as seen in the 31p-nmr spectrum in figure  <dig>  phosvitin is the major phosphoprotein in the amphibian oocyte. phosvitin is a glycosylated, serine-rich peptide with reported masses of 16- <dig> kda,  <dig> kda, or  <dig> kda . a single resonance  dominates the proton-decoupled 31p-nmr spectrum of xenopus phosvitin  <cit> . comparison of the phosvitin spectra with and without proton decoupling suggests a triplet splitting pattern for the major resonance, presumably due to coupling to methylene protons.

rabinowitz and lipmann  <cit>  were the first to demonstrate reversible phosphate transfer between yolk phosphoprotein and atp. attempts were made to determine the equilibrium constant of the reaction between atp and phosphoprotein. figures varying from  <dig> to  <dig> were obtained for the forward reaction. however, their experiments indicated a non-homogenous phosphate population. the authors suggested that the "thermodynamic potential of phosphoryl  in phosvitin to be not far below that of atp". mano and lipmann  <cit>  subsequently found that only more highly phosphorylated forms of phosvitin were good acceptors of phosphate from protein kinase and atp. this suggests that a large fraction of the phosvitin serine phosphates do not turn over in situ. our data indicate  that only a small fraction of the serine phosphates in yolk phosvitin may be available for reversible phosphoryl exchange with adp/atp.

phosvitin also contains firmly bound, non-heme iron  <cit> . grant and taborsky  <cit>  suggested that at alkaline ph, autoxidation of iron converts phosvitin-bound serine phosphate to the corresponding enol phosphate, an energy-rich structure. however, subsequent studies by rosenstein and taborsky  <cit>  failed to find evidence for the production of a stable phosphoenol product and a demonstration of the stability of the c-h bond at the α-carbon of the oxidized residue further ruled it out. their finding that phosphate release occurs by p-o bond cleavage is consistent with a mechanism by which an oxidatively generated carbonium ion derivative of phosphoserine is converted into a stable product by the direct formation of the free aldehyde and a monomeric metaphosphate ion, the latter reacting with water to yield inorganic orthophosphate. rosenstein and taborsky  <cit>  proposed that yolk phosvitin would provide the developing embryo with a potential phosphorylating agent  which becomes activated by oxidation.

progesterone-induced protein phosphorylation
phosvitin phosphate turnover is minimal in control oocytes  and the 15-fold increase in 32po <dig> incorporation in progesterone-treated oocytes reflects the increased phosphate turnover in one phosphate per block of  <dig> serine phosphates in hormone stimulated oocytes, indicating that specific serine residues of highly phosphorylated species of yolk phosvitin are further phosphorylated in response to progesterone. this is consistent with the proposal by williams and sanger  <cit>  that structures containing serine-phosphoserine blocks could serve as active sites in cellular metabolism.

the failure to observe a progesterone-induced increase in 32p-labelling of phosvitin in xenopus laevis ovarian follicles by maller et al.  <cit>  may be due, in part, to dephosphorylation by endogenous ferrous/ferric ions during protein isolation. additionally, xenopus laevis ovaries contain only a small subpopulation of "banded" oocytes that are selectively released by gonadotropin  <cit> . thus, increased phosvitin phosphorylation may only occur in a small subpopulation of xenopus laevis oocytes that are exposed to progesterone. in comparison, 100% of the large rana pipiens oocytes respond to, and are released from, the follicles by gonadotropin. the xenopus phosphorylation studies should be repeated using the "banded" oocyte population.

taken in toto, our findings indicate that progesterone initiates a selective internalization of plasma membrane rich in na/k-atpase . this decrease in na/k-pump activity coincides with plasma membrane depolarization and significantly reduces the atp utilized for ion transport. increased phosphorylation of the yolk protein phosvitin coincides with membrane depolarization and occurs just prior to the breakdown of the nuclear membrane. our previous studies showed  <cit>  that intracellular ph rises from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the prophase-arrested oocyte to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   during the first  <dig> h after exposure to progesterone, consistent with utilization of h+ during atp formation via the creatine kinase reaction.

possible mechanism of progesterone-mediated increases in high energy phosphate compounds
the surface of the prophase amphibian oocyte  <cit> , as well as that of most other cells  <cit> , is studded with microscopic, flask-shaped invaginations called caveolae  that can either open for receiving and/or releasing material or close for processing and/or delivery to intracellular sites. coinciding with the internalization of ouabain bound to the α-subunit of na/k-atpase, there is a net internalization of rana oocyte plasma membrane and a disappearance of ouabain-sensitive k+-current  <cit> . dersch et al.  <cit>  report a similar progesterone-induced increase in cortical membrane trafficking in xenopus laevis oocytes. by completion of the first meiotic division the cytoplasm of the progesterone-stimulated prophase oocyte becomes isopotential with the extracellular environment  <cit> . xie and askari  <cit>  concluded from studies with cardiac cells that there are two pools of na/k-atpase with distinct but coupled functions. one is the classical pool in which the enzyme acts as an energy transducing ion pump and is localized in non-caveolar membranes. the other is the steroid -modulated, signal-transducing pool of the enzyme, which, through helix-helix interaction with membrane proteins called caveolins  <cit> , is localized within the lipid rafts associated with the caveolae . our results suggest that progesterone acts to shift α-subunits from non-caveolar plasma membrane regions to the lipid rafts associated with caveolar membranes, followed by increased endocytosis of the caveolar vesicles. this is consistent with evidence indicating that the membrane regions containing >95% of the na/k-atpase are selectively internalized over a 2- <dig> h period prior to nuclear membrane breakdown  <cit> .

the α-subunit of na/k-atpase may thus cycle between the non-caveolar regions of the plasma membrane and the caveolar membranes. our experiments indicate that decrease in the rate constant kf for the pcr → atp reaction  coincides with internalization of the na-pump. the decrease in rate constant must arise from reduced adp availability and would result in an increased cytosolic phosphoryl potential. this increased phosphoryl potential would, in turn, contribute to enhanced phosphorylation of yolk phosvitin .

cation binding to yolk platelet phosvitin
in addition to non-heme iron  <cit> , yolk phosvitin also contains ca2+, mg2+, na+ and k+  <cit> . partially relaxed 23na fourier transform nmr spectra revealed the existence of at least two major intracellular compartments of nmr-visible na+  <cit> . a large fraction of the rana oocyte na+ was nmr-invisible and could be recovered in the yolk platelets  <cit> . during the first meiotic division there is a net increase in nmr-visible na+; by completion of the second meiotic division , about 70% of the total na+ becomes nmr-visible. thus, phosvitin not only serves as a site for energy storage, but also as a storage site for iron and other ions essential for embryonic development in ponds and streams that contain little dissolved salts and minerals.

CONCLUSIONS
the pattern emerging from these and related studies indicates that progesterone binding to the n-terminal external loop of the α1-subunit of na/k-atpase initiates a cascade of events, facilitated by the internalization of na/k-atpase  <cit>  and sequential changes in plasma membrane phospholipids . as shown here, progesterone binding initiates a marked rise in phosphocreatine and phosphoryl potential within the first few hours, followed by an accumulation of the highly phosphorylated protein phosvitin by the onset of second metaphase arrest. continued binding of progesterone to the catalytic-subunit of the na-pump is essential during the first 4- <dig> h  <cit>  and leads to a net internalization of 50-60% of the total oocyte plasma membrane  <cit> , which contains more than 95% of both bound progesterone and the ouabain-sensitive na/k-atpase  <cit> . we propose that progesterone binding to the catalytic-subunit of the na/k-atpase leads to a shift of na/k-atpase to lipid rafts. these rafts contain na/k-atpase-progesterone-caveolin-lipid microdomains  <cit>  and undergo selective internalization prior to nuclear membrane breakdown. the resulting diversion of oxidative energy from cation regulation at the plasma membrane to storage as high energy phosphates in yolk phosvitin is essential for the subsequent fertilization and early cleavage.
