BACKGROUND
the lung is a complex, precisely structured organ in which the vascular network is intimately associated with epithelial-lined tubes and sacs for the prime purpose of gas exchange. in the developing lung, the specific temporal-spatial interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells are carefully orchestrated to permit the gradual establishment of an effective blood–gas barrier   <cit> . the formation of the mammalian respiratory unit is initiated during the transition between the pseudoglandular and canalicular/saccular stages and is characterized by coordinated proliferation and differentiation of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. during the saccular stage, the distal tips of the pulmonary airways dilate and primary septa form. type i  layer) and type ii pneumocytes continue differentiating from primordial bronchoalveolar cells and the interstitial mesenchyme becomes thinner  <cit> . later, as alveolarization progresses, secondary septa develop and the microvascular network matures from a double to a single capillary network  <cit> .

the essential components of the bgb were established early in evolution and are conserved among vertebrates. only mammals and birds have a complete separation of pulmonary and systemic circulations  <cit> . despite anatomical differences, the lungs of both species are functional equivalents, so the chick can serve as an effective experimental surrogate for the formation of the bgb in mammals . in contrast to later postnatal development in mammals, the pulmonary bgb in chick develops primarily in ovo prior to hatching and is characterized by a massive increase in air and blood capillaries, which develop with a progressive reduction of the lung interstitium  <cit> .fig.  <dig> lung development timeline and type iv collagen expression in the chicken and the mouse. a mouse and chicken lung development comparative timeline. b microarray analysis shows that vascular related genes, among which are col4a <dig> and col4a <dig>  show the highest significance in late chick lung development. c real-time pcr shows differential expression of col4a <dig>  and col4a <dig>  between e <dig> and e <dig> in chick lungs. col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> expression increases at e <dig> and e <dig>  and is statistically significant  when compared to e <dig>  chicken g6pdh was used as a normalizer. d–i type iv collagen protein and mrna expression in the lung. d–g col4a <dig> protein is found throughout the lung interstitium and epithelium  in the prenatal  and postnatal  lungs but mainly in the interstitium at e <dig> . at p <dig> and p <dig> murine col4a <dig> protein is found at the tips of secondary septa . h–k col4a <dig> mrna is almost undetectable by in situ hybridization at e <dig>   and is later found in a patchy distribution throughout the interstitium  with high expression at the tips of primary and secondary septa . scale bar = 100 μm and applies to d–i




type iv collagen is the major component of the bgb epithelial and endothelial basement membranes and is responsible for its strength  <cit> . the most widely distributed form of collagen iv is the isoform  <dig> a <dig> . homozygous mutations of col4a <dig> and col4a <dig>  are lethal after mid-embryogenesis  because of impaired basement membrane stability  <cit> . heterozygous mutants developed porencephaly with severe perinatal cerebral hemorrhage, along with ocular and renal abnormalities; pups were also often observed to be cyanotic with respiratory distress, dying soon after birth  <cit> . most col4a1+/Δex <dig> heterozygous mouse mutants with deletion of exon  <dig> exhibited compact lungs with little or no detectable terminal air spaces  <cit> . col4a1+/Δex <dig> mutations had been shown to cause an increase of intracellular accumulation and a decrease of extracellular collagen, and the decrease of extracellular type iv collagen might contribute to the abnormal angiogenesis observed in col4a1+/Δex <dig> mutants  <cit> . abnormalities in vascular development are also observed in col4a1–/–; col4a2–/– mutants  <cit> .

multiple paracrine signals between epithelium, endothelium and mesenchymal stroma direct alveolar development and need to be coordinated to ensure the proper formation of the bgb at birth  <cit> . the pulmonary vasculature is essential for alveoli formation, which is disrupted when angiogenesis is inhibited . equally important are the alveolar myofibroblasts, believed to direct alveolar septal formation by controlling elastin synthesis  <cit> . during alveologenesis, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha  expressing myofibroblast progenitors differentiate into alpha smooth muscle actin  alveolar myofibroblasts which are anchored onto the basement membrane . mice with defective myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation reveal phenotypes of impaired alveolar development .

defective alveolarization is observed in immature lungs from babies born prematurely or with lung hypoplasia, and in chronic lung disease . lung immaturity is the consequence of the arrest of lung development between the saccular and the alveolar stages, whose molecular mechanisms remain unclear despite their critical role for the formation of the gas exchange unit. taking advantage of the rapid avian pulmonary development, we studied gene expression trends occurring mid to late in bgb formation using microarrays with col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> among the most upregulated genes. although mutations in several basement membrane components, including col4a1+/Δex <dig>  have been reported to result in little or no detectable terminal air spaces , very little is known about the role of the basement membrane or collagens in alveologenesis. we found that col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutations caused defects in epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal alveolar patterning that result in an aberrant bgb combined with defective elastin deposition and septa formation. col4a1+/Δex <dig> conditional expression in vascular cells was sufficient to cause a disorganized bgb. finally, we determined that type iv collagen directs myofibroblast proliferation and migration, and the formation of septal-like formations in vitro. type iv collagen appears to control the epithelial, endothelial and myofibroblast components of the alveolar unit, thereby permitting adequate gas exchange.

RESULTS
microarray analysis identifies high col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> expression at the time of chick bgb formation
taking advantage of the more rapid in ovo formation of the avian bgb respiratory units , we isolated rna from gallus gallus embryonic lungs at embryonic days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in triplicate. the microarray data analysis showed  <dig> significantly differentially expressed transcripts , corresponding to  <dig> unique mouse orthologs listed by ensembl biomart. the differentially regulated genes between e <dig> and e <dig> were annotated by the mouse genome informatics  visual annotation display  tool. the most significantly enriched gene ontology  categories were angiogenesis  and extracellular matrix . vascular development was among the most prominent processes at this stage . between e <dig> and e <dig>  there were  <dig> vascular up-regulated genes,  <dig> of which had anova p <  <dig>  . interestingly, the up-regulated genes col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> were present across every significant go category identified . real time-qpcr confirmed the increase of col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> in the chick lung during gestation .

col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> are essential in the mouse for saccular and alveolar growth
we used a number of mouse genetic models to study the role of type iv collagen during lung organogenesis, including three distinct mutations from an allelic series of col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutations and a col4a <dig> conditional allele . mutations from the allelic series include a point mutation in col4a <dig> , a point mutation in col4a <dig>  and a splice site mutation in col4a <dig> that results in a deletion of exon  <dig> . in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> and tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> conditional mice, the mutation was generated by flanking exon  <dig> with loxp sites and therefore recreates the col4a1Δex <dig> mutation in a cre-dependent manner   <cit> . besides having different mutations, all of the strains are otherwise genetically identical.

in normal mouse lungs at e <dig> , e <dig> , postnatal day  <dig> and p <dig>  type iv collagen is expressed in the interstitium. col4a <dig> localization in the epithelial basement membrane at the branching tips at e <dig>  is almost undetectable , but it is found in proximal epithelium and also at the tip of secondary septa . col4a <dig> mrna expression was very week at epithelial tips and surrounding mesenchyme at e <dig>  , but later, at e <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig>  it was clearly found in the lung interstitium and at the tips of the developing septa . hematoxylin and eosin  staining of the lungs of col4a1+/Δex <dig> mutants at e <dig>  showed no clear difference in branching morphogenesis compared with wild type lungs . later, at e <dig>  , col4a1+/Δex <dig>  col4a1+/g394v and col4a2+/g646d displayed lung hypercellularity and thickened interstitia. moreover, the tips of the distal airways in lungs from mutant mice failed to form saccules and primary septa . surviving col4a1+/Δex <dig> mutants have reduced viability  <cit> ; however, those that survive to p <dig> and 1 month  have an emphysematous-like phenotype with simplified alveolarization and an overall decrease in the number of secondary septa . toluidine blue staining of lungs from col4a1+/Δex <dig> mice also showed alveolar simplification with thick septa . closer examination of col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs showed an increase of blood capillaries and cells with lipid content . both the inducible r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> and vascular endothelial restricted tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> conditional mutants also showed simplified alveoli formation at p <dig>  with r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> lungs having a phenotype similar to col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs. tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> conditional lungs have numerous blood capillaries, but accumulation of cells with lipid content in the septa is not observed . electron microscopy of col4a1+/Δex <dig> also showed increased capillaries and thick interstitium in septa . lung septa also appear to display an excess of elastin fibers .fig.  <dig> histological examination of col4a1

type iv collagen in the mouse regulates distal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation during saccular formation
to investigate whether the lung hypercellularity is the result of abnormal distal epithelial cell proliferation, we co-stained e <dig>  lungs with the proliferative ki <dig> and the lung epithelial lineage factor nk <dig> homeobox  <dig>  markers. ki <dig> at e <dig>  showed an overall increase of cell proliferation  with little or no epithelial proliferation, as indicated by nkx <dig>  and ki <dig> co-localization . next, we studied distal epithelial differentiation by staining with nkx <dig> , sry-homeobox  <dig>  and pro-surfactant protein c , and discovered a statistically significant decrease of sox9+ progenitor cells  and an increase of pspc+ type ii pneumocytes . real-time pcr of col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs confirmed decrease of mrna expression of sox <dig>  but not an increase in pspc mrna . after alveolarization, an increase in pspc+ cells was still observed . morphologically, col4a1+/Δex <dig>  col4a1+/g394v and col4a2+/g646d had a patchy distribution with clustering of sox9+, nkx <dig> + and pspc+ cells versus normal lungs . at p <dig> and p <dig>  heterozygous col4a1+/Δex <dig> and r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> mice still displayed an increase of clustered pspc+ type ii pneumocytes  that was not observed in endothelium restricted tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> mice or in normal siblings . when, we co-stained col4a1+/Δex <dig> lung sections with pspc and the type i pneumocyte marker podoplanin , we found that clusters of pspc+ cells grouped around a fragmented pdpl at e <dig> and p <dig> . later, at p <dig>  the alveolar epithelium showed disorganization . this disorganization was observed in p <dig> r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig>  but not obvious in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> .fig.  <dig> decreased epithelial progenitors and increased type ii pneumocytes in col4a1

to more clearly show abnormalities in the development of type i pneumocytes, we also stained lung sections with the hop homeobox  antibody, which is specific for the nuclei and cytoplasm of type i pneumocytes  <cit> . our data showed a decrease in the number of hopx+ cells in col4a1+/Δex <dig> at e <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig> . p <dig> tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> lungs hopx expression was similar to normal lungs  but it was reduced in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> at p <dig> . when col4a1+/Δex <dig> mice were analyzed before the saccular stage, at e <dig> , no apparent differences in cellular proliferation, epithelial and mesenchyme markers were observed .

vascular type iv collagen is necessary for normal of epithelial and endothelial association
to assess pulmonary microvasculature development in type iv collagen mutants, we stained endothelial cells for cluster of differentiation  <dig>  at e <dig> , p <dig> and p <dig>  first, we co-stained with cd <dig> and ki <dig> at e <dig> , which confirmed active endothelial proliferation in both normal and mutant lungs . at the saccular stage , normal cd <dig> staining showed an organized double layer of endothelial cells  forming a lung vascular plexus that develop into a single layer  in close proximity to the alveolar epithelial type i pneumocytes during alveolar maturation . at e <dig> , col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutants showed a tortuous vascular plexus spreading throughout the lung interstitium  which was exacerbated at p <dig>  and at the end of alveolarization . epithelial–endothelial disorganization was also observed in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig>  and in the postnatal-induced r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig>  mice, indicating that loss of endothelial-derived type iv collagen is sufficient to disrupt the endothelial–epithelial association.fig.  <dig> abnormal microvasculature and endothelial–epithelial association in col4a1

type iv collagen regulates myofibroblast proliferation and migration
we further characterized the lung mesenchyme in addition to the epithelial and endothelial compartments. the pdgfrα-expressing pulmonary myofibroblast progenitors that normally decorate the walls of terminal saccules at e <dig>  , showed an irregular patchy distribution in col4a1+/Δex <dig> , col4a1+/g394v and col4a2+/g646d  mutants. pdgfrα mrna was significantly decreased in col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs . at p <dig> and p <dig>  the decrease of pdgfrα+ cells was evident in col4a1+/Δex <dig> , but not in the conditional mice r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> and in the tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> mutants . differentiated lung myofibroblasts express specific markers related to their functional state  <cit> . during saccular formation, α-sma myofibroblasts, normally detected at the tip of primary septa , were decreased in a patchy distribution in col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutant lungs . no difference in α-sma gene expression was found in col4a <dig> mutants . at p <dig>  α-sma was not observed at the septal tips . after alveologenesis, α-sma+ alveolar myofibroblasts were only localized at the tips of alveolar ducts   <cit> . however, α-sma+ slender interstitial myofibroblasts were present in surviving col4a1+/Δex <dig> and in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> mice , but not in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> lungs .fig.  <dig> abnormal development of alveolar myofibroblast in col4a mutants. a myofibroblast progenitors positive for pdgfrα are normally scattered in the alveolar walls and at the tips of primitive septa at e <dig>  . b in col4a1

lipofibroblasts are a second type of lung interstitial fibroblast; therefore, we examined lung lipofibroblasts in mutants by staining for adipose differentiation-related protein . lipofibroblasts were found to be moderately increased at p <dig> and markedly elevated at p <dig> in the col4a1+/Δex <dig> and in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> compared to normal lungs . however, these changes were not observed in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> mutants .

to confirm that the increased lipids in mutants are due to type ii pneumocytes and lipofibroblasts, we stained for macrophage antigen . p <dig> col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs  showed a slight decrease of macrophages that was not so evident at p <dig> .

since the data above suggest a role of type iv collagen in alveolar myofibroblast proliferation and mobilization, we investigated myofibroblast proliferation by treating normal human lung fibroblast  with type iv collagen recombinant protein. α-sma+, but not α-sma–, nhlfs showed a statistically significant increase in proliferation and migration after 48 hours of treatment . these results confirm that type iv collagen is sufficient to induce both myofibroblast proliferation and migration.

abnormal expression of tropoelastin and elastin fiber deposition in type iv collagen mutants
the force necessary for lifting the alveolar crest from the primary septal wall is thought to be produced by septal fibers  <cit> , which prompted us to study tropoelastin and elastin fiber localization in type iv collagen mutants. during saccular formation, the normal distal expression of tropoelastin was reduced in col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutants and the elastin fibers were discontinuous and fragmented . real-time pcr showed a borderline significant decrease of tropoelastin in col4a <dig> mutants . at p <dig>  very little expression of tropoelastin was found at alveolar tips and elastin fibers were abnormally deposited . at the end of alveolarization , tropoelastin and elastin fibers were diffuse throughout the lung interstitium and at the tip of the secondary septa of col4a1+/Δex <dig>  and in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> . in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> mutants, tropoelastin was markedly decreased in the lung interstitium and septal tips . abnormalities in elastin fiber deposition were less severe than in the non-conditional mutants .fig.  <dig> abnormal alveolar tropoelastin and elastin fiber accumulation. a at e <dig> , tropoelastin expression in the developing septa in normal lungs is detected at the tips  and throughout the interstitium . c by contrast, in col4a1

type iv collagen directs epithelial–mesenchymal association in vitro
to investigate the role of type iv collagen in septation, we used an epithelial–mesenchymal co-culture model of alveolar morphogenesis  <cit> . this model produces peaks of mesenchymal cells covered by an epithelial lining. the central core of mesenchymal cells closely resembles the myofibroblasts seen during alveolar septal development in vivo  <cit> . when mrc- <dig> fetal mouse mesenchymal cells were co-cultured with human a <dig> epithelial cells, septal-like formations appeared after 4– <dig> days and reached their maximum after 7 days . after type iv collagen addition, cellular aggregations where larger  and showed strong staining of pdpl, α-sma+ and type iv collagen proteins .fig.  <dig> in vitro epithelial–mesenchymal aggregations after col4a treatment. a, b control and type iv collagen-treated epithelial–mesenchymal co-cultures. septum-like formations are outlined. type iv collagen treatment  results in bigger epithelial–mesenchymal aggregations. c, f localized pdpl expression is found in controls and, more highly expressed, in type iv collagen-treated co-cultures. d, g α-sma staining is dispersed throughout the co-cultures with clear accumulation of α-sma+ of the co-culture aggregations. e, h co-localization of pdpl and α-sma. i, j staining of co-culture with col4a shows increased accumulation of col4a1-stained condensed fibers



discussion
we performed gene expression profiling at four embryonic time points  in the chick lung seeking to uncover molecular regulators contributing to late lung development and taking advantage of rapid development of the bgb in the chick. this analysis revealed that col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> genes are highly upregulated during the late embryonic stages of chick lung development. these data are consistent with the peaks of expression of murine collagen iv at e <dig> and p <dig>  which correlate with saccular and alveolar development  <cit> . our study of col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutant mouse lungs revealed multiple abnormalities in pulmonary alveoli supporting the importance of type iv collagen in alveolar development. the phenotype observed in col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutants is characterized by a block between the saccular and alveolar stages reminiscent of the severe abnormalities of premature newborns and children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

in this work, we show that murine type iv collagen is necessary for alveolar patterning and cellular development during saccular and alveolar morphogenesis. after alveolarization, at p <dig>  all the analyzed mutants showed alveolar simplification with the strongest phenotype in col4a1+/Δex <dig> lungs. postnatal-induced conditional mutants in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> displayed a milder phenotype than col4a1+/Δex <dig> as a result of normal alveolar progenitor development during saccular development. the abnormal phenotype in r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> revealed an active role of type iv collagen in alveolarization that is independent of branching and saccular defects. we also show that col4a <dig> mutation carried by the tie <dig> promoter in tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> was sufficient in causing microvascular defects without the epithelial and fibroblast abnormalities observed in col4a1+/Δex <dig> and r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> 

type iv collagen is found in the basement membranes of epithelial and interstitial endothelial cells where alveolar elastin-producing myofibroblasts are anchored  <cit> . in addition, normal col4a <dig> mrna expression is elevated in the lung interstitium and at the tips of the septa in the mouse after branching morphogenesis. consequently, it is not surprising that pulmonary epithelial, vascular and myofibroblast development is affected by col4a <dig> or col4a <dig> mutations. at the completion of branching morphogenesis , we did not observe differences between col4a1+/Δex <dig> and col4a1+/+ lungs. the absence of branching may be because we analyzed heterozygous mutants in which sufficient levels of native protein may be enough to carry out branching. previous studies have also shown that defects on basement membrane components affect alveoli formation, but not branching morphogenesis  <cit> . in addition, our data using the postnatal conditional mutants suggests a role of col4a in alveologenesis independent of branching.

by the time of saccular  morphogenesis, the lungs from mutant mice had a thick interstitium and failed to develop normal saccules. we showed that mutant lungs have a decrease in the number of distal sox9+ epithelial progenitors and an increased number of type ii pneumocytes in a patchy distribution. this data suggests that type iv collagen may regulate sox <dig>  which has been previously shown to be critical for alveologenesis by controlling the transition of distal epithelium from proliferation to differentiation  <cit> . in mutants, a decrease in sox <dig> is coincident with expansion of type ii pneumocytes. defects in epithelial differentiation may also be a consequence of abnormal basement membrane, which normally undergoes alteration during lung development . starting in the saccule stage and during alveolarization the basement membrane is discontinuous under type ii pneumocytes but not under type i  <cit> . therefore, it is also possible that the mutant type iv collagen may affect basement membrane integrity, altering type ii pneumocyte differentiation. epithelial differentiation defects in mutants are also supported by the decrease in hopx cells. epithelial progenitors express both type i and ii pneumocyte markers  <cit> . hence, the increase of pspc+ cells appears to be a consequence of differentiation but not of alveolar progenitor proliferation. increased and disorganized type ii pneumocytes and decreased hopx were also observed in postnatal col4a1+/Δex <dig> and induced r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> mice, but not in vascular directed tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> conditional mutants. these findings indicate that type iv collagen controls epithelial differentiation and organization independently of vascular type iv collagen.

it has been shown that mutations in col4a <dig> can affect the integrity of the vascular basement membrane leading to an aberrant organization of capillary structures  <cit> . additionally, mice with mutations in the basement membrane component fibulin have abnormally wide lung capillaries with normal capillary organization  <cit> . our col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutant mice likewise manifested aberrant organization of the pulmonary microvasculature that was obvious 1 month after birth due to an apparent abnormal angiogenesis. pulmonary endothelial growth is known to be essential for alveolar formation not only in lung embryonic development , but also in pulmonary alveolar regeneration  <cit> . our work shows that col4a <dig> mutation in vascular endothelium is sufficient to produce abnormalities in pulmonary microvascular growth, to alter the alveolar endothelial–epithelial association, and to cause alveolar epithelial developmental deficiencies. more experiments are needed to address, conversely, whether restricted type iv collagen mutation in the epithelium will also direct abnormalities in the association of the endothelium and epithelium of the alveolar interface.

during alveologenesis the pulmonary saccules are divided through serial septation, which increases the surface area for gas exchange. important players in the process of septation are myofibroblasts anchored in the alveolar basement membrane . the expression of pdgfrα is decreased in col4a <dig> mutants and both pdgfrα+ and α-sma+ alveolar myofibroblasts are displaced in the interstitium of the embryonic col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutants. the decrease of pdgfrα+ and α-sma+ cells is also evident after birth. this suggests that type iv collagen may be necessary for the correct spatial patterning of the alveolar myofibroblasts during septal formation in part through the pdgfrα pathway. in pdgfrα–/– mice the alveolar myofibroblast spreading is compromised and most pdgfrα+ cells remain in clusters at the bronchiolar wall instead of being scattered throughout the alveolar sacs  <cit> . in contrast to myofibroblasts, col4a <dig> mutants have an increase in lipofibroblasts. recently, it has been reported that the pdgfrα+ fibroblast lineage contributes to the lipofibroblast pool in the mouse lung  <cit>  and that myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts are characterized by pdgfrαgfpbright/high and pdgfrαgfpdim/low expression during alveolarization  <cit> .

in the presence of type iv collagen mutant protein, both myofibroblast proliferation and migration were negatively affected, while in vitro addition of type iv collagen protein induced proliferation and migration in α-sma+ lung fibroblasts, confirming its important role.

alveolar myofibroblasts are the source of alveolar tropoelastin, which is an important regulator of alveologenesis when its expression levels are high  <cit> . α-sma expression in elastogenic alveolar myofibroblast cells follows type iv collagen expression, and both precede the expression of tropoelastin  <cit> . interestingly, col4a <dig> mrna is expressed in the interstitium and at the tips of alveolar septa in a pattern similar to tropoelastin. therefore, it is conceivable that type iv collagen regulates elastogenesis specifically in the α-sma+ cell population. earlier loss of type iv collagen directs loss of alveolar myofibroblasts, tropoelastin, and causes aberrant elastin fiber accumulation which may be the main cause for the dramatic failure of saccular formation. by the end of alveolarization in the mouse, at p <dig>  lungs appear to have excessive interstitial elastin fiber accumulation in col4a1+/Δex <dig> and r26-creer; col4a1+/flex <dig> mice which is likely due to ectopic elastin-producing α-sma+ myofibroblasts localized in a patchy distribution in the lung interstitium. it is also possible that the abnormal elastin fiber accumulation may be a compensatory response to failure of alveolar formation  <cit> . tie2-cre; col4a1+/flex <dig> lungs lack this patchy interstitial distribution of α-sma+ cells and interstitial elastin fiber accumulation, suggesting a direct effect of col4a <dig> on alveolar myofibroblasts that is independent of vascular type iv collagen.

there are four alpha integrins  known to bind to collagen type iv – itga <dig>  itga <dig>  itga <dig>  itga <dig>  among them, itga <dig> and itga <dig> have a higher affinity for type iv collagen than itga <dig> and itga <dig>  <cit> . itga <dig> is expressed in proximal and distal lung epithelium co-localizing with pspc , and itga <dig> is expressed in the microvasculature by co-staining with cd <dig>  itga <dig> is also expressed in non-type ii cells, suggesting a role in other developmental processes in the lung. itga <dig> has been reported to be expressed in human lung interstitial fibroblasts  <cit> , but we only observed it in the proximal epithelium . future investigation should be directed at uncovering the molecular pathways by which integrins affect type iv collagen regulation of the epithelium, vasculature and myofibroblasts during alveologenesis.

to address a direct effect of type iv collagen in septal formation we used an in vitro co-culture of mesenchymal–epithelial cells designed to resemble alveolar septal formation  <cit> . a <dig> epithelial cells share properties with immature alveolar type ii pneumocytes but not of type i pneumocytes . when a <dig> cells are co-cultured with lung fibroblasts, they express the type i pneumocyte marker pdpl, which co-localizes with α-sma+ cells in type iv collagen treated co-cultures. endogenously produced type iv collagen fibers are also increased in the cell aggregates found in treated co-cultures. these aggregates may be due to cellular reorganization in addition to epithelial–mesenchymal proliferation. herein, we demonstrated that type iv collagen signaling might indeed be important for the epithelial–mesenchymal interaction needed for septal formation.

in summary, we show that type iv collagen is essential for alveolar lung patterning and propose a model  in which type iv collagen regulates the epithelial and endothelial components important for alveologenesis , induces interstitial α-sma myofibroblasts to proliferate and migrate to the tip of the septa during early septation, and later contributes to extension and final maturation of secondary septa.fig.  <dig> schematic alveolar representation and suggested model for type iv collagen during alveologenesis. a normal alveolar septum in which type i  and ii pneumocytes  cover the alveolar surface with the blood capillaries in close association. alveolar myofibroblast progenitors localized at the base of the septum proliferate, differentiate into alveolar myofibroblast, and migrate where they synthesize elastin. lipofibroblasts are localized close to atii. b type iv collagen mutations cause abnormal septum formation. type iv collagen lungs have increased cells with lipid content , and abnormal capillary formation. alveolar myofibroblasts fail to proliferate, differentiate and migrate, causing defects in elastin deposition. c suggested model for type iv collagen, basement membrane and septal myofibroblast development. type iv collagen is a central player in myofibroblast progenitor proliferation, differentiation and mobilization to the tip of the septum



CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that type iv collagen is a key player in the process of alveolar morphogenesis and is critical for the proper formation of the bgb and the process of septation. col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> mutations in humans cause multisystem disorders in which pulmonary symptoms have not been observed. however, goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the basement membrane col4a <dig> of lungs and kidneys, manifests lung abnormalities ranging from symptoms as mild as a dry cough and minor breathlessness to those with more severe lung damage  <cit> . it is possible that mutations in col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> affecting the lung could go undetected, as they would cause major developmental abnormalities leading to early mortality.
