BACKGROUND
evolution has produced remarkably complex and diverse living organisms with different morphological phenotypes observed in shape, size, and other traits. this morphological variation is important for their survival during environmental disruption, and many biologists aim to clarify how organisms evolved their phenotypic variation throughout their long evolutionary history.

the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a leading model organism used in genetics and systems biology because it has cellular processes in common with many eukaryotic cells. after the whole genome of the laboratory yeast strain was sequenced  <cit> , most yeast genes were functionally annotated, providing insights into the relationship between genotype and phenotype. high genetic variance was found in different yeast subgroups based on analyses of yeast strains isolated from different ecological niches  <cit> . natural yeast strains also exhibited high phenotypic variation based on the analysis of yeasts cultured under various environmental conditions  <cit> . these results described the relationship between phenotype and genetic background, which provided insights into the origins of natural phenotypic variation. however, the relationship between the phenotype and genotype in natural strains remains unclear, as how an individual gene influences the phenotypic variation within the species is unknown. furthermore, most previous research was restricted to fitness  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit>  phenotypes.

yeast cell morphology reflects various cellular events, such as progression through the cell cycle, establishment of cell polarity, and regulation of cell size. recent techniques have allowed quantitative analysis of the relationships between different morphological traits and gene deletions. a study on  <dig> haploid nonessential gene deletion strains revealed that approximately half showed abnormal morphological traits compared to the parental strain  <cit> , and approximately  <dig> of these genes were thought to be phenotypic capacitors required for the maintenance of phenotypic robustness  <cit> . a recent study showed that the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%  <cit> . the natural strains exhibited their own morphological traits  <cit> . however, how the natural strains confer such phenotypic variation remains unclear. one of the ways to resolve this is to compare morphological variations in natural strains and those generated by deleting individual genes . if the variations generated by the set of individual gene deletion mutants are smaller than those of the natural variation , this suggests that the most distinct morphologies among the natural strains are due to their genetic complexity. if the variations of the set of gene deletion mutants are larger , then that deleted gene beyond the natural strains is possibly functional in the natural strains and important for the maintenance of natural yeast morphology.figure  <dig>

in this study, a high-dimensional image-processing program calmorph was used on digital microscopic images to ascertain cell shape, actin, and nuclear dna morphology. we analyzed the morphological variations with a generalized linear model , an extension of the normal linear model  <cit> , by incorporating various probability distribution models. the statistical models were set to assess the effects of a homozygous gene deletion of yeast diploid on cell morphology.

RESULTS
mosaic segregants are more variable than their pure parental strains
to evaluate the morphological diversity in yeast, we focused on two aspects: the standard deviation in each parameter and the population expansion in the orthogonal phenotypic space that was degenerated in dimension from high-dimensional morphological traits. the diverse population could be expanded in orthogonal phenotypic space.

to confirm the validity of our procedure, we compared mosaic segregants with their pure parental strains, because it is well known that genetic mosaicism results in phenotypic variance  <cit> . two pure parental strains belonging to the laboratory strain  and the wine strain  and their mosaic segregants  were compared with the  <dig> morphological traits of the published data  <cit> . we analyzed the  <dig> morphological traits, including cell shape, actin, and nuclear dna morphology, as previously described  <cit> . the morphological value of each trait was normalized using the glm . we found that parameters with a broader distribution were more frequently observed in the mosaic strains . the variance in the mosaic segregants was higher than that in the parental strains for  <dig> of  <dig> traits. we also confirmed the diversity of the mosaic segregants in a representative trait, termed the “mother axis ratio” .figure  <dig>

to ascertain the degree of global morphological variance, we performed principal components analysis , a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation. an advantage of comparing in the degenerated orthogonal space is that one can exclude bias caused by the correlation between the morphological parameters. we found that the morphological distribution of the mosaic segregants was broader than that of the parental strains in the principal component  <dig> and pc <dig> spaces . the mosaic segregants also showed a broader distribution in the spaces between any other pairs from pc <dig> to pc <dig> . thus, our analyses confirmed that the mosaic strains contained a higher morphological variance than that of the parental strains and validated our procedure.

homozygous gene deletion strains have higher morphological variance than natural strains
to compare the phenotypic variation between natural strains and gene deletion mutants, an analysis was performed of the morphological data of  <dig> typical natural yeast strains previously published  <cit>  and the most distinct  <dig> gene deletion mutants. the most distinct homozygous diploid strains were selected based on the morphological data of the haploid strains, using global mahalanobis distance, a unitless and scale-invariant measure of the distance and an abnormal distribution in the pc1 − pc <dig> phenotypic space . we confirmed the distinct morphological phenotypes of  <dig> gene deletion mutants in diploid . we found that the variance of the set of the gene deletion mutants was higher than that of the natural strains for  <dig> of  <dig> traits , while the most distinct  <dig> gene deletion mutants were more diverse in the “whole cell size”  representative trait . analysis of the global variance also revealed more distinct gene deletion strains than found in the natural strains. the morphological distribution of the gene deletion strains was  <dig> -fold broader than that of the natural strains in the first two pc spaces . diversity of the gene deletion strains was also observed in the spaces between any other pc1 − pc <dig> pairs . based on these results, we concluded that the set of the gene deletion strains had a higher morphological variance than the natural strains.figure  <dig>

identification of mutants with a higher number of morphological changes than natural strains
given that the set of the gene deletion strains were more diverse, some of the deletion mutants were expected to have an abnormal morphology not seen in the natural yeast strains. to identify the deletion mutants with significant morphological changes beyond those of the natural strains, we performed a one-sample test with a normal distribution based on the pc scores in pc1 − pc <dig>  the contribution ratio of the first four pcs reached 60% . thus, we detected the  <dig> heteroclite mutants  with the first four pcs, expecting that the gene functions disrupted in these  <dig> mutants are important in nature. we found that the number of mutants detected in each pc was not the same, with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mutants in pc <dig>  pc <dig>  and pc <dig>  respectively. no mutants were detected in pc <dig>  the mutants detected in each pc seldom overlapped. only four overlapping mutants were detected in the  <dig> heteroclite mutants . pc <dig> and pc <dig> had a higher ability to detect the heteroclite mutants; of the  <dig> mutants,  <dig>  were detected by pc <dig> or pc <dig> . these results suggested that the deletion mutants detected by pc <dig> and pc <dig> caused more diverse morphological changes than the natural strains. to know the morphological features that vary among strains, the pc loadings of pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig> were analyzed . representative parameters were then extracted by a pca with null-distributed data as described by ohnuki et al.  <cit> . the pca analyses indicated that pc <dig> contributed most to the following traits: the “average cell size of budded cells”  and “distance between nucleus and mother tip” . likewise, pc <dig> contributed to the following traits: “ratio of the cells with actin localization in bud” , “size of actin region in bud” , and “ratio of large bud” . pc <dig> contributed to the traits, “noise of long axis length in mother”  and “noise of mother cell size”  as shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  to ascertain whether sufficient deletion mutants had been analyzed, the next most distinct  <dig> gene deletion strains were sampled  and the one-sample test was repeated. no deletion strains were detected in the first four pcs, suggesting that our analysis of the morphologically variable  <dig> strains was robust.figure  <dig>

properties of the  <dig> heteroclite mutants
although the one sample test using the natural strains identified  <dig> heteroclite mutants out of  <dig> mutants, the average mahalanobis distance from the parental strains was not significantly different , suggesting that the difference between these groups was not due to the extent of morphological difference but rather to different morphological profiles. because each pc represented different cell morphological features, we looked for differences in the pcs. then we found that these  <dig> genes were distributed differently from those in the pc <dig> and pc <dig> spaces . some of the deletion mutants with larger  or smaller  cell sizes  or a higher accumulation of cells with delocalized actin patches  were defined as the heteroclite mutants, which indicated that a loss-of-function of the  <dig> corresponding genes  resulted in morphological changes in specific traits.

fitness analysis of the  <dig> heteroclite mutants
yeast mutants with an unusual morphology tend to suffer from growth defects. deletion mutants with an abnormal morphology, not present in the natural yeast strains, may be missing from the natural population due to their slow growth. we examined this possibility in the  <dig> heteroclite mutants and in the remaining  <dig> mutants. fitness was assessed for the nonessential gene deletion strains in rich media  <cit>  to compare the degree of fitness. we found that number of deletion mutants with significantly decreased fitness was similar;  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene deletion mutants conferred decreased fitness compared to the wild-type strains in the  <dig> heteroclite and  <dig> mutants, respectively. an alignment of these mutants according to their degree of fitness is shown in additional file 9: figure s7a. the distribution of the deletion mutants  indicated that the fitness of most of the  <dig> strains was distributed around a central fitness of  <dig>  whereas the heteroclite and the rest of the gene deletion mutants were distributed at a lower fitness level. no significant differences were observed between the heteroclite mutants and the other mutants . thus, many morphological mutants had decreased fitness, but this was not more common in the  <dig> heteroclite mutants.

of the  <dig> heteroclite strains,  <dig> were identified as slow-growth mutants in normal medium  <cit>  . we found that all of the remaining  <dig> heteroclite strains were assigned to at least one phenotype relating to a decrease in the stress response, such as “decrease of resistance to environmental stress,” “decrease of resistance to chemical stress,” and “decrease of resistance to ethanol stress” . this suggested that the loss-of-function mutation of these  <dig> genes was negatively selected for under these special environmental conditions.figure  <dig>

protein abundance analysis of the  <dig> heteroclite genes
ghaemmaghami et al.  <cit>  carried out genome-wide analyses of the protein levels in s. cerevisiae. this data were used to compare the abundance of the protein molecules per cell for the  <dig> selected genes with deletions resulting in a variable morphology. the protein molecules of the  <dig> nonessential genes were distributed across a wide range  as were those of the  <dig> selected genes . to investigate the differences of the abundance of the protein molecules between the  <dig> heteroclite genes and the others, a mann–whitney u-test was performed. we found that no significant differences  were detected. this suggested that the morphological abnormalities caused by the deletion of the  <dig> heteroclite genes were not dependent on protein abundance, and that protein abundance was not a common property in the heteroclite genes.

assessment of genetic interactions in the  <dig> heteroclite genes
the degree of genetic interaction correlates with the number of different gene attributes  <cit> . in this study we investigated the relationship between the morphological extent in the gene deletion mutants and the number of genetic interactions. stringent cutoff values were imposed to identify the genetic interaction in each gene . we found that >70% of the selected genes had > <dig> genetic interactions, with an average number of  <dig>  , although about 50% of the randomly selected nonessential genes contained < <dig> genetic interactions. a mann–whitney u-test showed this difference to be statistically significant . these results suggested that the high morphological diversity of the heteroclite mutants was due to the impact of the genetic interaction.figure  <dig>

gene annotations frequently observed in the  <dig> heteroclite genes
to identify the gene ontologies  that were statistically enriched in the  <dig> heteroclite genes, a multivariate analysis of variance  was applied. we found that of the  <dig> gos that were annotated to at least three of the  <dig> heteroclite genes , nine gos showed a significant correlation  with pc <dig>  pc <dig>  or pc <dig>  which differentiated the deletion mutants from the natural strains. this implied that these nine gos were selected due to the morphological phenotype of the deletion mutants.

to ascertain the representative gos, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on the similarity of annotated genes. a dendrogram was constructed based on complete linkage, which highlighted four representative gos that covered  <dig> genes . we found that the go with the lowest p-value  was “cellular response to heat” , which was annotated to nup <dig>  rpb <dig>  and swi <dig> . since this go, identified by pc <dig>  contributed mostly to the trait, “ratio of the cells with actin localization in bud,” actin localization, was most likely perturbed by the loss-of-function of genes involved in “cellular response to heat.” likewise, “polysome” , “recombinational repair” , and “protein acylation”  were identified by pc <dig>  pc <dig>  and pc <dig> . thus, essential gos and morphological phenotypes conserved in nature were proposed.figure  <dig>

discussion
the natural yeast strains analyzed were derived from different geographical and ecological origins, and displayed diverse morphological phenotypes  <cit> . they contained an average of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> deletion events, with > <dig> base pairs  per strain  <cit> . the nonessential gene deletion collection contained a single deletion in every gene, which highlighted the fact that approximately 50% of the deletion mutants had an abnormal morphology compared with their parental strains  <cit> . here, we showed a more diverse morphology for the deletion mutants than the natural yeast strains after verifying our procedure with the mosaic progeny and showing the robustness of our analysis for the strain selection. we also identified deletion mutants with morphologies not encountered in the natural yeast population. we propose that these genes are essential gene candidates in nature.

although natural strains accumulated many nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> , their morphology was less diverse than the deletion collection, suggesting a robustness of the cell morphology in the natural yeast strains. several possible explanations exist for the conserved morphology in the natural strains. first, a cellular mechanism may coordinate an increase in cell size with biosynthetic capacity and nutrient availability  <cit> . therefore, natural yeast strains likely have an upper size limit. the deviation of the long axis length in the mother cell was  <dig>  −  <dig>  and  <dig>  −  <dig>  μm in natural yeast strains and the deletion collection, respectively. these results showed that natural yeast strains were less diverse in cell size. second, the morphological parameters that directly affect growth rate may be conserved due to the advantages they confer during the competition to survive. when the ratio of unbudded cells increased, an increase in doubling time was expected  <cit> . the ratio of unbudded cells was between  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the natural yeast strains  <cit> , implying that the unbudded ratio of  <dig> % was constitutive. third, the loss of cell polarity may result in defects in shmoo formation and in the mating process  <cit> , which could constitute an evolutionary disadvantage. thus, the evolutionary conservation of morphological traits may link to the survival of the extant budding yeast in nature.

we revealed a higher morphological variation generated by single gene deletions. yeast deletion mutants with a slow-growth phenotype likely work against natural competition in nature  <cit> . we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> heteroclite deletion mutants had >10% reduction in fitness. in addition to the decreased fitness in the normal medium, the heteroclite deletion mutants were often unable to grow under certain growth conditions, such as high or low temperatures, lack of nutrients, treatment with toxic compounds, and radiation exposure. survival under severe environment conditions and response to change is essential for preservation of the species  <cit> . another possibility is the presence of lesions other than those of vegetative growth. yeast life cycles are composed of many processes involving different forms and cell shapes  <cit> . genes acting on vegetative cellular morphogenesis are sometimes essential for the progression of other yeast life cycles, including germination, mating, meiosis, sporulation, and biofilm formation, which may be confer a competitive advantage in survival. finally some yeast variants may become disadvantaged during breeding or domestication  <cit> . due to their usefulness for alcohol fermentation, saccharomyces yeast species may acquire their competitive advantage under high ethanol conditions.

some properties were common in the heteroclite genes. the heteroclite genes frequently displayed a relatively large number of genetic interactions because the deletion mutant genes conferred the most variable morphological phenotypes. we hypothesized that the genes with a high number of genetic interactions acted as a hub in the cellular network  <cit> , affecting many aspects of cell morphology. alternatively, the predominant yeast genes involved in essential cellular processes frequently interact with each other and thus influence cell morphology to a major extent. we also ascertained that the genes belonging to the heat-shock response, dna repair, translation, and protein modification were enriched in the heteroclite mutants. this led to the speculation that these gene functions are essential in nature; e.g., budding requires genes involved in the heat-shock response. the genes involved in dna repair are important because this function is required for adaptation or survival under exposure to natural radiation. since exposure to mild stress leads to an increased tolerance for other stresses  <cit> , these functions may be necessary in preparing for future threats.

CONCLUSIONS
high-dimensional morphometric features of saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined to find that the gene deletion strains had higher morphological variance than the natural strains. our multivariate analyses revealed gene deletion mutants whose morphologies were not seen in nature. the yeast genes that were practically important in nature were characterized in terms of extent of genetic interaction and specific cellular functions. although evolution has often been cited in the context of current living species or for those now extinct, this study provided a new insight into the evolution and species conservation of yeast. further study will be required to fully clarify the evolution of important yeast genes by means of competitive assays with deletion mutants and natural yeast strains.
