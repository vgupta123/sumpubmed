BACKGROUND
cellular function in a biological system normally involves participation and interaction of multiple genes. mutations that alter function of any one of these genes can potentially increase disease susceptibility. for example, the tumor suppressor gene brca <dig> suppresses cell growth and participates in transcription-coupled dna damage repair. mutations in brca <dig> increase the risk of early onset breast cancer as well as ovarian and prostate cancer . genes with functions similar to brca <dig> can be considered additional candidate genetic risk factors for breast, ovarian, prostate, or other cancers.

one common approach to identify functionally similar genes is to find genes that share significant sequence homology. however, functional similarity does not always require sequence similarity. for example, both p <dig>  <cit>  and brca <dig>  <cit>  function as tumor suppressor genes. similar to brca <dig>  mutations in p <dig> have also been found in breast cancer patients  <cit> . the two genes share no sequence homology. as a result, a sequence similarity search tool, such as blast  <cit> , is unable to reveal their functional similarity.

an alternative to sequence homology search is key word search, but this approach has two weaknesses. first, key words for gene functions are not well defined. second, key word search is a static binary operation and therefore cannot quantify the significance of the search results, which makes it difficult for a user to evaluate the outcome.

in recent years, the go consortium has made major advances in establishing structured, controlled vocabularies describing gene functions. each vocabulary is structured as a directed acyclic graph , wherein any term may have more than one parent term as well as zero, one, or more child terms. the dag structure provides a much richer description of the underlying biology than would be possible with a strictly hierarchical tree graph. go describes genes and proteins using three categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component . "molecular function  describes catalytic or binding activities, at the molecular level. individual molecular function terms include the broad concept such as 'kinase activity' and the more specific '6-phosphofructokinase activity', a subtype of kinase activity. biological process  describes biological processes accomplished by one or more ordered assemblies of functions. high-level processes such as 'cell death' can have subprocesses, such as 'apoptosis' and 'apoptotic chromosome condensation'. cellular component  describes subcellular structures and macromolecular complexes. examples of cellular components include 'nuclear inner membrane', with the synonym 'inner envelope', and the 'ubiquitin ligase complex', with several subtypes of these complexes represented." currently, the go vocabulary consists of more than  <dig>  terms .

uniprot  is a comprehensive catalogue of information on protein sequence and function created by integrating data from swiss-prot, trembl, and pir. uniprot is the central access point for extensive curated protein information, including function, classification, and cross-reference. go assignments have been applied to data sets in uniprot representing the complete human and mouse proteomes by a combination of electronic mappings and manual curation . this vocabulary has also been applied to the nonredundant proteome sets in uniprot for all other completely sequenced organisms as well as to proteins from a wide range of organisms where the genome is not yet complete.

recently, some web servers  have provided gene search engines for shared gene ontology  terms and some stand-alone software packages  also provide gene similarity search functions.

using different similarity measures and search methodologies, we have developed a search engine: gene functional similarity search tool , to identify candidate genes based on their functional similarities. we have implemented gfsst for the human and mouse proteomes in the uniprot database. for a given protein with known functions or a set of protein functions, and a given proteome, the gfsst search engine not only can find any proteins in the proteome with the same functions  but also can discover proteins with similar functions . we have defined a statistical measure: d-value  to quantify functional similarity of genes based on the go directed acyclic graph . there are three levels of definition for d-values. first, the d-value for each go term on go dag is defined as a positive value with additive and monotonic properties. the d-value for each term is the sum of the d-values of its direct children . obviously, the d-value of the child cannot be greater than the d-value of its parent . in its current implementation, the d-value at the root of go dag is assigned a value of  <dig>  and all leaf terms have the same d-value. then, the d-value for every pair of go terms is defined as the minimum d-value of their common parent terms. for identical go terms, the d-value is set to zero. the d-value for a pair of genes is defined as the mean of the d-values for their matched go term pairs. more details can be found in the methods section and in the discussion.

RESULTS
we have developed a gfsst search engine for human and mouse proteomes. input data can be a set of go terms or a protein identifier  in the human or mouse uniprot database. the search can be carried out against the human or the mouse proteome. the search engine can also be used as retrieval tool for the human and mouse uniprot databases.

search by a source protein
given a source protein, gfsst can retrieve functionally related proteins from a specific proteome. to illustrate this process, we used human brca <dig> as an example. brca1_human  in uniprot  has  <dig> go terms in the biological process category . most of those terms refer to dna repair and regulation of apoptosis. the top  <dig> hits of brca1_human searched by gfsst are listed in table  <dig>  one of which is p53_human. the two genes share one common go term go: <dig>  and  <dig> similarly matched pairs of go terms. one of the pairs is go: <dig>  and go: <dig> . their common parent with minimum d-value  <dig>  is go: <dig>  . so the d-value for the pair of go terms is  <dig> . more go terms matched for p <dig> and brca <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  there are a total of  <dig> hits with d-values <  <dig>  in the three go categories after brca1_human search by gfsst, one of which is brca2_human with d-value  <dig> .

in mouse model research, it is important to find mouse proteins that are functionally similar to a human protein. the top  <dig> matches with d-values <  <dig>  in searching the uniprot mouse proteome  with gene brca1_human in the biological process category are listed in table  <dig> 

search by go terms
gfsst provides a robust retrieval tool for gene and gene products based on their associated go terms. this is a more flexible approach than searching with a source protein. users can design their search targets by a single or a combination of go terms. given go terms, gfsst can retrieve gene products from a specific proteome. thus users can design their search by providing a set of gene functions . gfsst can find genes or gene products matched by those functions and/or by similar functions.

for example, glucose metabolism is a critical pathway in the study of diabetes. the target proteins with the glucose metabolism function  in the biological process category will thus be relevant to diabetes. gfsst delivered  <dig> exact matches for this go term in the uniprot human proteome. insulin tops the search results.

dna damage response, signal transduction by p <dig> class mediator  is a very important function in cancer research. performing gfsst search for this go term in the biological process category we find no exactly matching gene products in the uniprot human proteome. there are four protein hits, including brca1_human matched by go: <dig>  with d-value  <dig> , and p53_human and p73_human matched by go: <dig> with d-value  <dig> . it is not surprising that there are no exact matches for the term go: <dig>  because there are some more specific terms under go: <dig>  its children, that are assigned for gene products.

users can also query a set of go terms to obtain target proteins for the biological functions of interest. for example, angiogenesis inhibitors are designed to stop tumors from developing a blood supply, a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis. four go terms, go: <dig> , go: <dig> , go: <dig> , and go: <dig> , describe the biological processes involved in angiogenesis inhibition. gfsst found  <dig> proteins with d-value <  <dig>  via the above four go terms. the first  <dig> proteins are listed in table  <dig> 

discussion
gfsst is a new search engine that facilitates the selection of candidate genes and gene products for human disease, for mouse models, for biomarkers, and for drug targets. gfsst can retrieve function-specific gene products  from the uniprot database based on assigned ontology annotations rather than sequence, sequence motif, or other sequence attributes. the gfsst search quality will improve with the increasing accuracy and completeness of go dag and gene annotation by go terms. its usefulness will grow as biological studies expand our current knowledge of the proteome.

it is an important and unique feature of gfsst that users are able to retrieve genes not only from annotated genes, but also from a combination of go terms. gfsst can retrieve not only the genes with shared go terms but also the genes with very similar  go terms. in order to make gfsst useful not only for users who are familiar with go terms, more technologies may be needed such as natural language search tools.

well-defined d-values for go terms, for a pair of go terms, and for a pair of annotated genes  are the foundation of gfsst. we have not yet considered evidence codes in the calculation of d-values. for stronger evidence, a heavier weighting factor should be used. we plan to add evidence codes to our algorithm in the next version of our web server.

it is possible to assign different distributions to go terms. lord and his collaborators  <cit>  have used the frequencies of the matches to go terms by uniprot gene products as distributions. we can calculate probabilities p for go terms and pairs of go terms exactly as done in  <cit> , and then calculate the d-value for two groups of go terms with our greedy pairing algorithm. using this d-value system, we have tested gfsst for brca1_human. different but similar results are obtained. outputs obtained using the two measures for brca <dig> gene similarity search are listed in table  <dig> . our d-value distributions do not need to calculate the hit frequencies, and are not sensitive to annotation changes; they are in fact essentially annotation-independent. in other words, the d-value is a universal measure for go terms and pairs of go terms, and so can be used for any go annotated database search. the similarity measure used in  <cit>  is dependent on the probability of the specific term occurring in the annotated database, and thus is not a universal measure. this becomes a significant issue for cross-species, such as human-to-mouse, searches, and searches against sources with different annotations, since separate probabilities, p, would need to be calculated for every individual and every pair of species/database similarity searches. nonetheless, in future releases of gfsst, an option for selecting measures other than d-values will be provided for limited databases.

there are some available web servers for gene similarity search that are not entirely restricted to homology. the ucsc gene sorter  <cit>  "displays a table of genes within a selected genome that are related to one another." the gotoolbox  <cit>  "has developed methods and tools based on the gene ontology  resource allowing the identification of statistically over- or under-represented terms in a gene dataset; the clustering of functionally related genes within a set; and the retrieval of genes sharing annotations with a query gene." we tested gene sorter and gotoolbox with the source protein brca1_human. a comparison of the results from gfsst, gene sorter and gotoolbox is presented in table  <dig>  most of the gotoolbox gene products listed in column  <dig> of table  <dig> fall within the parts of the ontology dealing with apoptosis, androgen binding, and similar categories, perhaps because the algorithm will usually search for terms no more than one step up in the go dag. in contrast, the hits using gfsst  seem to cover a broader spectrum of the ontology, e.g., dna damage response, cell proliferation, centriole regulation, receptor signaling in addition to those already mentioned, due to the fact that the computation is not limited to only one step up the hierarchy. hence, gfsst provides the opportunity to find unsuspected gene products that may cooperate  to subserve larger biological, enzymatic or metabolic functions, for example shared elements of multiple signal transduction pathways. in the case of the go search directed from the ucsc browser , only those gene products which have been characterized in the available gene expression studies, albeit quite a large portion of the known genes, will be targeted; this may explain the different hits, for a perhaps narrower range of specific categories, and a few seemingly more farfetched ones.

the similarity measures based on the shared go terms are simple and useful methodologies. but they are limited to the fact that if there are no shared terms, the similarity score , , and  in  <cit> ) will be  <dig> even if two genes have very similar functions. recognizing this weakness, the authors of gotoolbox extended the shared go term from "common associated term" to "common parent terms"  <cit> . we understand this to mean the most immediate "parent terms". our d-value measurement defines a similarity score for every pair of go terms. for example, the pair go:  <dig>  and go:  <dig>  do not have the most immediate one step up parent . gotoolbox considered this pair not shared. in contrast, the d-value in gfsst is  <dig>  for this pair, which is one of the aligned pairs for brca1_human and p53_human . in table  <dig>  gfsst listed p53_human as the protein with the most significant score for the brca1_human search, but it is not at the top of the gotoolbox search results. it is very interesting that gene sorter listed tp <dig> at the top of its output, which may be explained by the fact that, in addition to shared terms, gene sorter uses popularity score in its search.

in short, different search engines have different algorithms and different features. if one wishes to find similar genes with shared go terms, gene sorter and gotoolbox are good choices. if one is interested not only in shared, but also similar go terms, gfsst is preferable. beyond that, gfsst allows users the flexibility to design their search targets.

CONCLUSIONS
an implementation of gfsst which works on the uniprot  for the human and mouse proteomes is available at gfsst web server  <cit> . gfsst provides functions not only for similar gene retrieval but also for gene search by one or more go terms. this represents a powerful new approach for selecting similar genes and gene products from proteome databases according to their functions.
