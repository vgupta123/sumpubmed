BACKGROUND
osteohistological examinations of fossil vertebrates have provided important insights into their ontogeny and physiology  <cit> . in addition to the description of bone tissue types, considerable attention has been paid to skeletochronological indicators, such as the number and relative spacing of lines of arrested growth  and other cyclical growth marks within the bone cortex  <cit> . the presence of tightly spaced growth marks within relatively avascular tissues in the outer margin of the bone cortex  has been used to infer somatic maturity in sampled individuals  <cit> . in the absence of an efs, patterns in the relative spacing of lags has been used to infer the ontogenetic stage of an individual, in some cases using a single sectioned element  <cit> . on a finer scale, the density of osteocyte lacunae  in the cortex of limb bones of tetrapods has been suggested to be related to mechanical forces and differential loadings, basal metabolic and growth rates, and element structural differences  <cit> , and osteocyte lacuna morphology itself has also been shown to be related to these properties  <cit> . recently, the densities of osteocyte lacunae have been used to predict basal metabolic rates and relative growth rates in fossil tetrapods, including dinosaurs  <cit> .

few studies to date have focused on variation in lag spacing between different limb bones of a single individual; individual variation in osteocyte lacunar morphology  <cit>  and density  <cit>  in the long bones of tetrapods suggests that element choice and sampling location may influence studies using these histological parameters to infer life history traits in fossil taxa. here, we describe bone microstructure and assess intra- and inter-skeletal variation in skeletochronological indicators  and osteocyte lacunar density  in a sample from the horseshoe canyon formation  of ornithomimid theropod skeletons, three of which were found closely associated in the same stratigraphic horizon and likely represent individuals dervied from the same population  <cit> . specifically, we use the intra-specific, multi-element osteohistological data to test two separate hypotheses: 1) that patterns of lines of arrested growth  spacing in different elements of a single individual provides a consistent signal for evaluating its relative maturity, and, 2) osteocyte lacunar densities  are generally consistent between limb elements of a single individual, and between individuals of a given taxon due to their shared physiology and loading regimes. growth marks, such as lags, are particularly well documented in theropod dinosaurs  <cit> , and this detailed case study of individual variation in a single theropod taxon may provide insights that can be extended to other theropod dinosaurs, as well as tetrapods more generally.

RESULTS
histological description
in each sampled element of the bonebed individuals , the bone matrix is consistent in being predominantly a woven-parallel complex, showing a combination of laminar, plexiform, and reticular patterns of vascularization. an external fundamental system  is absent in all elements, with all periosteal margins showing active primary bone deposition and well-vascularized tissue  <cit> . however, some differences exist in the relative distributions of vascularization and the degree of secondary remodelling in elements of each individual, and in the number of lines of arrested growth  preserved.figure  <dig> 
summary of sectioned elements of cmn  <dig>  cmn  <dig>  and cmn  <dig> 




the bone tissue of the femur of the largest individual   ranges from laminar to plexiform, with the density of radial canals varying throughout the section. secondary remodelling is minimal in most areas of the femur; however, there is a heavily remodelled section of the medial cortex that is associated with a slight external eminence of the periosteal margin where the cortex is thickened relative to the rest of the section. three lags are visible in the femur, with the innermost lag partially lost due to remodelling and cortical drift. the outermost lag appears as a double lag in some limited sections of the cortex. the tibia of cmn  <dig>  is comprised primarily of laminar bone, with some plexiform regions due to localized increases in the density of radial canals. secondary remodelling occurs in the inner cortex, although secondary osteon development is not extensive, nor is there evidence of considerable outward expansion of the medullary cavity along the endosteal margin. cortical thickness is inconsistent, with the medial side of the element being considerably thicker. three lags that completely extend around the cortex are visible in the tibia. the fibula  of this individual shows plexiform and reticular bone, with greater vascularization towards the periosteal margin. there is extensive secondary remodelling on the medial side of the cortex, including several large, well-developed, secondary osteons, and a poorly developed medullary cavity. unlike the other sectioned elements of this individual, the fibula preserves four visible lags. the third pedal phalanx  exhibits primarily laminar vascularization, with some regions appearing semi-plexiform to plexiform. there is secondary remodelling concentrated along the inner cortex, particularly along the ventral side of the phalanx. this area of the cortex is also slightly thicker than the lateral or dorsal sides. like the femur and tibia, three lags are preserved in the phalanx.figure  <dig>

cmn  <dig>  is smaller than cmn  <dig>  but approximately the same size as cmn  <dig>  the tibia of cmn  <dig> has primarily laminar to plexiform vascularization, with areas of reticular bone associated with increased density of radial canals. there is little to no secondary remodelling, nor is there evidence of erosion of the cortex via expansions of the medullary cavity. the cortex thickness is relatively consistent in the incompletely preserved section, and two lags are present. the fibula  of this individual shows primarily reticular vascularization, with more extensive secondary remodelling on the medial side of the cortex. however, secondary remodelling is less extensive than in the larger fibula of cmn  <dig>  a well-defined medullary cavity is present, and the fibula preserves three lags. metatarsal iv  has reticular and plexiform vascularization, concentrated towards the inner cortex, and laminar vascularization concentrated towards the outer cortex. much of the inner cortex is secondarily remodelled, although there are no outward expansions of the medullary cavity along the endosteal margin of the cortex. as in the tibia, but unlike the fibula, there are two lags present in the metatarsal. the pedal phalanx  exhibits primarily laminar vascularization, with two lags present in the cortex.figure  <dig>

the tibia of cmn  <dig>  has woven-parallel complex bone tissue with primarily laminar to plexiform vascularization, with little to no secondary remodelling  <cit> . the cortex thickness appears relatively consistent, and two lags that extend around the cortex are visible. like cmn  <dig>  the fourth metatarsal  is comprised of plexiform and reticular vascularization concentrated towards the inner cortex, and laminar vascularization concentrated towards the outer cortex. there is secondary remodelling concentrated in the inner cortex and through sections of the medial and lateral outer cortex as in its associated tibia, there are two lags visible in the metatarsal of cmn  <dig> figure  <dig>

the fibula of rom  <dig>  exhibits primarily plexiform vascularization with reticular vascularization in some sections towards the inner cortex, and less vascularized, more laminar tissue towards the periosteum. there is no definitive presence of an efs/ocl. secondary remodelling is relatively extensive on the medial side of the cortex. five lags are present , with inter-lag spacing increasing between the first and second lag, and decreasing considerably between the subsequent lags approaching the periosteum. as in cmn  <dig>  this specimen has double lags, most notably near the middle of the cortex in the second lag, and additionally in variable positions of the fifth lag. while most of the lags visibly extend around the cortex , the third lag is visible in the posterior cortex, but becomes indistinct as it grades into the more heavily vascularized mid cortex and more remodelled anterior cortex.figure  <dig>

variability in growth line spacing
among the three ornithomimids from the horseshoe canyon formation bonebed , there is a similarity in the pattern of lag spacing in the femur, fibula, and tibia, with all three elements showing a relative increase in spacing from the periosteal margin to the innermost lag. however, the lowermost hind limb elements  did not show the same signal within a given individual; the metatarsals and pedal phalanges show a more consistent spacing between lags, and do not exhibit a decrease between the innermost lag and endosteal margin. although the absolute distance between lags varies within individual bones, the relative pattern of lag spacing  within a single bone is consistent between different measurement transects . however, the relative proportion of cortex defined by each cycle can vary in different measurement transects.figure  <dig>

osteocyte lacunar density
osteocyte lacunar density  in the total sample of four ornithomimids from the horseshoe canyon formation ranged from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> osteocyte lacunae  per mm3; standard deviations  ranged from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> ol/mm <dig>  depending on the individual or element sampled . the individual specimens averaged  <dig> ol/mm <dig>  for cmn  <dig>   <dig> ol/mm <dig>  for cmn  <dig>   <dig> ol/mm <dig>  for cmn  <dig>  and  <dig> ol/mm <dig>  for rom 852; the global individual average old is ~ <dig> ol/mm <dig> . sampling of the medial and lateral sides of each sectioned bone of cmn  <dig> yielded  <dig> ol/mm <dig> and  <dig> ol/mm <dig> for the femur,   <dig> ol/mm <dig> and  <dig> ol/mm <dig> for the tibia,   <dig> ol/mm <dig> and  <dig> ol/mm <dig> for the fibula,  and  <dig> ol/mm <dig> and  <dig> ol/mm <dig> for the pedal phalanx . sampling of the inner, middle, and outer cortex of the fibula of rom  <dig>  yielded results of ~ <dig> ol/mm <dig> , ~ <dig> ol/mm <dig> , and ~ <dig> ol/mm <dig>  respectively.table  <dig>

discussion
comparative osteohistology
all examined ornithomimid sections are characterized by woven-parallel complex tissue, with a range of laminar to reticular vascularization , and lack evidence of an efs/ocl  <cit> . each element sectioned has at least two lags. within each bonebed individual, there is consistency in the number of lags within each element, with the exception of the fibula, which consistently has one more lag. additionally, localized double lags are present in the femur of cmn  <dig> and the fibula of rom  <dig>  which suggests differential growth and localized suspension of bone deposition  <cit> . the femur of cmn  <dig>  the fibulae of cmn  <dig>  cmn  <dig>  and rom  <dig>  as well as the fourth metatarsal of cmn  <dig>  show localized secondary remodelling across the cortex that is likely related to adductor muscle attachment  <cit> . cmn  <dig> and cmn  <dig>  the smaller individuals within the sample , show consistency in the number of lags in corresponding elements, which supports the hypothesis that this bonebed represents a mass death assemblage where the preserved individuals are part of the same cohort  <cit> . in the largest bonebed individual, all corresponding elements preserve one additional lag compared to those of the smaller individuals, suggesting that it is at least one year older  <cit> . rom  <dig>  the largest individual overall , had one more lag in the fibula than cmn  <dig>  although there is no evidence of an efs/ocl in rom  <dig>  there is a decrease in tissue vascularity in the outermost cortex that suggests a reduction in bone growth rate  <cit> . as no efs/ocl is preserved in any of the sectioned ornithomimid elements from this study, none of these individuals had yet reached skeletal maturity, and were likely still growing in body size. these specimens are of similar overall size to many other known north american ornithomimids , including tmp  <dig> . <dig>  which is reported to have an efs/ocl  <cit> . this suggests that the maximum size of north american ornithomimids is not yet fully understood, and may show a large degree of individual or taxonomic variation.

this multi-element, multiple individual sampling approach permits the first in-depth, quantitative assessment of individual variation in osteohistological traits of a theropod dinosaur species. differences in lag counts in bones from the same individual is a pattern observed in other dinosaur histology studies  <cit> , and is not unexpected due the possibility of different rates of bone growth and remodelling in different parts of the skeleton. however, in this study of hind limb elements, only the fibula differs from the other sampled elements in that it preserves one additional lag among the multiple ornithomimid individuals. this differs from other studies that have sampled a wider representation of bones within the skeleton and have shown more variation within multiple elements of single individual  <cit> . the presence of an additional lag in the fibula suggests that it may be a preferred element for skeletochronology in theropods, because it preserves the longest growth record due to a small medullary cavity and less remodelling, as suggested in previous studies  <cit> . a potential drawback of using the fibula is that its irregular shape, coupled with strong allometric growth in diaphysis shape , complicates retro-calculation-based age reconstructions and growth-curve model-fitting. femora and tibiae do not have these growth related problems thus making them more favourable elements in equation-based retro-calculation growth reconstructions  <cit> . therefore, the diaphysis of these primary weight-bearing bones may be more effective for reconstructing growth curves than fibulae, despite the fact that the fibula appears to consistently preserve more lags in theropods. therefore, we propose that a within-individual, multi-element sampling approach can act as an internal check of retro-calculation-based age estimations, and that this will be the most powerful means of reconstructing growth curves of extinct vertebrates going forward.

lag spacing
spacing between lines of arrested growth is often used to qualitatively assess the relative growth rates and maturity in isolated bones, e.g. tyrannosaurus  <cit> , alioramus  <cit> , raptorex  <cit> , and a putative alaskan ornithomimosaur  <cit> . this method assumes that a decrease in lag spacing from the inner cortex to the periosteum corresponds with an individual approaching somatic maturity. in our sample, lag spacing is variable between different elements within a single individual . the femur, tibia, and fibula do show a similar trend of decreasing distance between lags, regardless of where within the cortex the spacing is measured. however, the metatarsal and pedal phalanges do not show the same pattern as their corresponding upper limb bones. here, distances between lags in the outer cortex, which presumably represent the same periods of growth as record in the crus and femur, are more variable and do not show constant decreases in spacing towards the periosteal surface. therefore, hind limb and foot bones of a single individual would yield different assessments of relative maturity if analysed in isolation. for example, the inference that an alaskan ornithomimosaur  <cit>  was approaching somatic maturity at the time of death based on a decreasing pattern of lag spacing in a single, isolated metatarsal, is poorly substantiated.

this type of variability in lag spacing between elements of a single individual is also evident in other fossil studies . differing lag spacing signals also appear to be present within different elements of an individual adult hypacrosaurus stebingeri , although the presence of an efs/ocl makes this difficult to show definitively; the fibula shows a pronounced increase in lag spacing from the periosteal margin to the inner cortex, whereas the rib has more variable spacing between lags. in addition, alternating patterns of increase vs. decrease in lag spacing through the cortex are also present in both the tibia and fibula of the asian ornithomimid sinornithomimus dongi  <cit> , as well as in a femur of tenontosaurus  <cit> . variability in lag spacing from the inner cortex to the periosteum is consistent with recent extant experimental work that shows that different long bones of an individual grow at different rates  <cit> , and may also relate to annual variation in resource availiblity  <cit> , or functional responses to ontogenetic gait shifts  <cit> , among other factors. these problems could be further compounded if spacing is not assessed at comparable locations in the cortex, as they could lead to different interpretations of growth or ontogenetic status . this demonstrates the unreliability of simple lag spacing patterns for inferring a particular ontogenetic stage or relative maturity across a wide range of taxa or elements in somatically immature specimens where an efs/ocl is not present  <cit> .

osteocyte lacunar density
recently, stein and werner  <cit>  quantified and compared osteocyte lacunar density  in a sample of adult limb elements from a variety of extant and extinct taxa, which included mammal old data from a study by bromage et al.  <cit> . they found significant relationships between old and body mass, and body mass-specific old and relative growth rates. whereas the stein and werner study did not explicitly address how intra- and/or inter-individual variation in old may limit the interpretive power of their results, care was taken to sample from the outer cortex of each element, sample the femur when available , and to use the largest individual per taxon in regression analyses when more than one sample was taken , in order to avoid variation in old values resulting from ontogeny or sampling location. although  <dig> percent of taxa included in stein and werner  <cit>  were represented by more than one individual or sample , intra-specific, intra-individual, and intra-element variation in old was not explicitly quantified or discussed in context of their results. given the variation in lacunar morphology  between elements  <cit> , variation in old within individual human femora  <cit>  and between fore-limb elements of modern taxa  <cit> , as well as quantification issues to due sectioning plane  <cit> , intra-specific variation is potentially problematic when trying to predict aspects of organismal palaeobiology using osteocyte lacunar density.

measured ornithomimid osteocyte lacunar densities varied within individual elements, and between elements of the same individual . all old values calculated for each individual are larger than those of larger tyrannosaurid theropods sampled by stein and werner  <cit> , as predicted by the inverse relationship between old and body mass. old values  are relatively larger than similarly sized mammals, but plot between mammals and birds of similar body size  <cit>  . this result is not unexpected, given the status of ornithomimids as small- to medium-bodied theropods  <cit> . however, our analysis indicates that there is considerably more variation in old between elements of an individual than in different positions within a single element , or in the average old between different individuals . this level of variation between elements of single individuals suggests that estimating metabolic  <cit>  or genome size  <cit>  characteristics of extinct organisms may be more complex than previously considered, and old counts may be affected by individual variation and allometry of different skeletal elements, as noted in studies of extant mammals  <cit> . despite this high intra-skeletal variation, the mean olds of each specimen, calculated from the lacunar densities of multiple sampled elements in its skeleton, are very similar, despite each specimen not always being sampled from the same set of elements. given this consistency, multi-element sampling and the use of individual/species mean olds is recommended in order to capture and control for the high variation present in sampling isolated individual elements.

stein and werner  <cit>  postulated a relationship between ontogenetic stage and old, and suggested sampling of old in the outer cortex of mature animals to control for changing old throughout ontogeny. our data suggest that, when sampling element and location is kept consistent, ontogenetic variation in old appears negligible. over the ontogenetic size range investigated here , no significant differences were found in sampling sites in the inner, middle, or outer cortex. however, it should be noted that none of our sampled series represents a skeletally-mature animal, given the lack of efs/ocl, and there appeared to be a weak, albeit non-significant, positive trend towards increasing old through growth.

CONCLUSIONS
histological thin sectioning of multiple hind limb elements of three semi-articulated ornithomimid individuals, and a fibular thin section from a larger, stratigraphically contemporaneous specimen of ornithomimus edmontonicus show a consistent pattern in lag numbers. each sectioned element within an individual has the same lag number, with the exception of the fibula, which possesses one additional lag. none of the sampled individuals appear to be skeletally mature, despite being of similar size to previously published mature individuals, suggesting a greater degree of individual variation in growth within north american ornithomimids than has been previously reported. spacing of lags shows two distinct patterns, with femur/tibia/fibula lag spacing decreasing relatively consistently from the inner to outer cortex, while the metatarsal/phalanx spacing remains more variable in spacing throughout the cortex. lag spacing appears to be variable, and too easily affected by other factors of bone growth and modification, to be of repeatable use in assessing growth throughout ontogeny of individual animals or species . similarly, osteocyte lacunar density appears more highly variable when making comparisons between bones of a single individual than when comparing the average values of different individuals. this suggests that, at least within closely related groups, element choice may have a greater impact on the measured result than ontogenetic stage of the individual. localized factors relating to differential limb growth may play a larger role in the distribution and density of osteocyte lacunae than previously thought, and are potentially biasing the interpretations of analyses based on single samplings of isolated specimens.
