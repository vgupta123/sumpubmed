BACKGROUND
climate change has increased the frequency of severe heat waves and the global temperature is projected to become increasingly warmer  <cit> . heat stress in poultry negatively impacts animal production and welfare resulting in economic losses estimated to be between $125- <dig> million for the u.s. broiler poultry industry  <cit> . during a severe heat wave in iowa, over  <dig>  million layer hens died  <cit> .

to reduce core body temperature during periods of heat stress, blood flow to internal organs decreases and blood flow to the combs and other surface tissues increases in chickens  <cit> . during periods of heat stress, blood volume and oxygen carrying capacity are altered  <cit>  and dehydration, caused by increased respiration, can increase hematocrit  <cit> . energy availability, as determined by plasma glucose level, is increased in chickens exposed to heat stress  <cit> .

during high ambient temperatures, chickens reduce feed intake by as much as 17 %, which reduces growth  <cit> . however, metabolic and endocrine changes during heat stress also contribute to reduction in growth in broilers, as demonstrated by a pair-feeding study  <cit> .

a major change in blood components is caused by heat-induced increased respiration, which results in respiratory alkalosis, a disturbance in the acid base balance characterized by an increase in blood ph accompanied by a decrease in pco <dig>  respiratory alkalosis occurs in broilers during heat stress and is associated with reduced growth rate  <cit> . metabolic alkalosis is an additional measure of disturbances in acid base balance and is defined by a decrease in the fixed acid concentrations and an increase in fixed base concentrations within the extracellular fluid  <cit> .

electrolyte balance is essential for acid base balance, maintenance of cellular homeostasis, synthesis of tissue protein, electrical potential of cell membranes, enzymatic reactions, and maintaining osmotic pressure  <cit> . altering electrolyte amounts in feed partially ameliorates the negative impacts of heat stress in broiler chickens  <cit> .

the goal of the current study was to identify the physiological changes and genomic regions associated with response to heat stress in chickens as characterized by the blood chemistry components, including ph, pco <dig>  po <dig>  base excess , hco <dig>  tco <dig>  k, na, ionized ca , hematocrit , hemoglobin , so <dig>  and glucose . in a commercial egg laying population, developmental measures have been established with hopes of using measures of blood chemistry components for selection  <cit> . to date, few studies have identified quantitative trait loci  for blood components in chicken . we used a 600 k snp panel to identify qtl regions associated with levels of blood components of chickens under thermoneutral and heat stress conditions, and changes induced by heat.

RESULTS

pathway analysis
the pathway analysis of all annotated genes within significant qtl regions across all measured traits, and separately for genes in the regions of qtl co-localization, and the top  <dig> significant  canonical pathways for each group are listed in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes identified within all significant qtl regions,  <dig> genes were annotated within ipa and used for the pathway analysis. two canonical pathways of interest for all identified qtl include the ampk signalling and angiopoietin signalling pathways. of the  <dig> genes in regions of qtl co-localization,  <dig> were annotated within ipa and used for pathway analysis. a pathway of particular interest that was revealed was the cardiac hypertrophy signalling pathway.table  <dig> top  <dig> canonical pathways for qtl identified for all traits, and for co-localized qtl

p-value
all characterized genes within significant qtl regions were used as input in ingenuity pathway analysis  software. the top  <dig> significant  pathways are listed. the results are displayed for pathways identified when using all qtl regions  which resulted in  <dig>  annotated genes used for pathway analysis. the bottom section of the table displays the pathways identified when using only the co-localized qtl regions  which resulted in  <dig>  annotated genes used for pathway analysis. the pathways are the top canonical pathways identified by ipa and are listed in alphabetical order. the ratio refers to the number of genes that were identified in the current study compared to the total number of genes that are in the pathway according to ipa



candidate genes
we explored regions of qtl co-localization in detail to identify candidate genes that may give insight into the complex biological mechanisms that control blood component response to heat stress. candidate genes were identified using ensemble biomart within the 1 mb windows that were significant for  <dig> or more traits .

discussion
the aim of this study was to identify and estimate the effect of qtl, and to perform a functional analysis using positional candidate genes, for blood components  using a novel ail of chickens under heat stress and a 600 k snp panel for genotyping. the blood components measured were within the accepted range reported for chicken  <cit> . blood chemistry components are grouped into functional categories  for discussion.

population studied
previous generations of this ail were used for several qtl mapping studies and allowed the identification of many qtl including  <dig> for growth and body composition ,  <dig> for skeletal integrity  <cit> ,  <dig> for metabolic traits  <cit> ,  <dig> for response to salmonella enteritidis challenge , and  <dig> for response to heat stress  <cit> . therefore, collectively, a wide range of traits have been associated with a large number of qtl in this ail. the continued erosion of linkage disequilibrium  in this population over subsequent generations, combined with the availability of larger snp panels, creates a unique opportunity to more finely map the location of qtl that are in ld with a causal mutation.

respiratory alkalosis
phenotypic measurements
during periods of intense heat, chickens increase the depth and frequency of respiration to decrease core body temperature  <cit> . broilers that are heat stressed increase panting and display signs of respiratory alkalosis  <cit> , which is caused by an increase in the amount of co <dig> expelled from the lungs, and a consequent increase in ph within the blood, and an increase in po <dig> within the blood. we investigated blood ph, pco <dig>  and po <dig> to characterize respiratory alkalosis induced by heat stress.

occurrence of respiratory alkalosis was clearly demonstrated in the current study by a significant increase in blood ph and significant decrease in pco <dig> due to heat treatment, in agreement with previous studies. heat stress for two hours at 32 °c in broilers at 35 days of age significantly increases blood ph and decreases pco <dig>  <cit>  and, in another study using broilers, heat stressed at 32 °c for 2 weeks at 28 days of age in birds that were panting  <cit> . we found po <dig> increased in response to heat treatment, although not significantly. in a study using 35 day old broilers, blood po <dig> significantly increased after cyclical heat stress for 10 days at 35 °c  <cit> .

heritabilities
only one other published study has estimated heritabilities of blood components in chickens under thermal stress  <cit> . the current study, therefore, adds substantially to the body of information on response of birds to thermal stress by estimating heritabilities of blood component levels and changes under heat stress and thermoneutral conditions. in broiler chickens at 22 days of age reared under cold stress conditions, heritabilities for blood ph, pco <dig>  and po <dig> were estimated at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> , in agreement with the current study’s estimates for thermoneutral and heat conditions. our estimates for the changes in these blood components due to heat treatment was much lower, suggesting that the ability to select for the response to heat stress may be difficult.

gwas
to our knowledge, qtl for blood ph, pco <dig>  and po <dig> in chickens have not been previously reported. identification of qtl for blood ph on different chromosomes across measurement phases, indicates that genetic control of these traits exists and is partly dependent on the environment. co-localized qtl for pco <dig> and pco228- <dig> on gga <dig>  and for pco <dig> and pco228- <dig> on gga <dig>  suggest that the same genetic regions contribute to control of pco <dig> level independent of environmental temperature. the presence of co-localized qtl between measurement phases was not expected, based on the lack of phenotypic correlations .

metabolic alkalosis
phenotypic measurements
metabolic alkalosis occurs when there is a disturbance in the fixed acids and bases in the extracellular fluid  <cit> . imbalance of dietary na, k, or ca can result in metabolic alkalosis  <cit> , which is characterized by an increase in blood ph, hco <dig>  and base excess, and can be induced in growing layers by high levels of calcium in feed  <cit> .

base excess is considered a comprehensive measure of the metabolic components of bases, which reflects the nonrespiratory contribution to changes in acid–base disturbances  <cit> . base excess can be altered by changing the cation:anion ratio in the diet of broiler chickens and is associated with body weight and bone density  <cit> . in the current study, base excess significantly increased after heat treatment, which is consistent with the hypothesis that chickens experience metabolic alkalosis under heat stress.

hco <dig> is the most abundant buffer in the blood, is primarily regulated by the kidneys, and is a metabolic component of acid–base balance  <cit> . we observed a significant increase in hco <dig> due to heat treatment. these results contrasted with a previous study using broilers at 28 days of age in which blood hco <dig> significantly decreased in panting birds under acute heat stress  <cit> , and another study using male broilers that reported a decrease in hco <dig> after a heat stress at 32 °c for 10 h  <cit> . tco <dig> also increased in response to heat treatment. it was unexpected to observe a decrease in base excess, consistent with metabolic alkalosis, while hco <dig> and tco <dig> increased, because the traits are highly positively correlated within all treatment phases .

heritabilities
we estimated heritability of base excess between  <dig> - <dig> , of hco <dig> between  <dig> - <dig> , and of tco <dig> between  <dig> - <dig> . in broiler chickens at 22 days of age reared under cold stress conditions, blood hco <dig> and tco <dig> heritability were both estimated at  <dig>   <cit> .

gwas
we are the first to report qtl in chickens for blood base excess, hco <dig>  and tco <dig>  which are related to metabolic alkalosis. qtl for base excess are located on separate chromosomes for all measurement phases, indicating a strong genetics by environmental  temperature interaction. the phenotypic correlations for base excess between measurement phases were both very low . the qtl for base excess on gga <dig> overlap with ph measured at thermoneutrality and were highly correlated . surprisingly, qtl for hco <dig> were only identified during heat treatment and were on gga <dig> and ggaz. ten of the eleven qtl for tco <dig> measured during heat co-localized with qtl for hco <dig> and these co-localized regions were located on gga <dig>   <dig>  and z.

electrolytes
phenotypic measurements
blood k and na levels numerically increased and ica statistically increased in response to heat treatment. this is in disagreement with previous reports of decreasing levels of both k and na in response to heat stress, likely due to increased water intake which results in decreased concentrations of electrolytes within the blood  <cit> .

heritabilities
heritability of k and na blood levels in humans has been estimated to be very low,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> , in agreement with our low heritability estimates during heat and for the calculated differential. in contrast, our estimates for heritability under thermoneutral conditions for k and na were higher,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. estimated heritability was  <dig>  for ionized ca measured during heat stress, lower than the  <dig>  of mice in thermoneutral conditions  <cit> . the estimated heritability was low, for both thermoneutral  and the differential due to heat , indicating the genetic component for ionized ca is dependent upon environmental conditions at the time of measurement. the low heritabilities of these traits during heat and for the calculated differential due to heat treatment suggest it may be difficult to select for these traits.

gwas
this research is the first to describe qtl for the electrolyte-balance traits of blood k, na, and ionized ca in the chicken. in swine, qtl have been identified for these traits  <cit> . qtl for blood k were located on gga <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  qtl were identified for k across the thermoneutral and differential due to heat measurement phases, indicating genetic control of this component in this region on gga <dig> despite environmental temperature. the correlation between thermoneutral and the differential was moderate . no significant qtl for na were identified in the current study and a single qtl for ionized ca was located on gga <dig> for the measurement taken during heat.

blood volume and oxygen saturation
phenotypic measurements
changes in blood volume and oxygen carrying capacity occur in chickens during periods of heat stress  <cit> . both hematocrit and hemoglobin significantly increased due to heat treatment, which may be the result of dehydration. this result contrasts with a previous study using male broilers in which both decreased after an acute heat stress at 32 °c for 10 h  <cit> . blood so <dig> is a measure of oxyhemoglobin in relation to total hemoglobin that is able to bind oxygen  <cit> , and this significantly increased during heat treatment.

heritability
the heritability of hct was estimated as very low at  <dig>  and  <dig>  for pre-heat and the differential, respectively, while during heat was moderately heritable at  <dig> . heritability has been estimated for hematocrit at  <dig>  in domestic fowl  <cit> . the increase in heritability when measured during heat stress indicates that this trait may be useful for selection. heritability estimates of so <dig> were very low , which is in general agreement with a previously reported value of  <dig>  in cold-stressed broiler chickens at 22 days of age  <cit> .

gwas
seven qtl for haematocrit have been identified in chickens . in a broiler by layer f <dig> intercross, qtl for hematocrit were located on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> ; in a fayoumi by leghorn f <dig> intercross on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  <cit> , and in a broiler by layer cross on gga <dig>  <cit> . our current work confirmed previously identified qtl for hct <dig> on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  novel qtl for hct were on gga <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  most of the qtl identified in the current study for hb co-localized with those identified for hct, with the addition of a relatively large qtl for hb28- <dig> on gga <dig>  explaining  <dig>  % of the genetic variation. the co-localization of qtl among hct and hb is expected because they have very high positive phenotypic correlations across all measurement phases . we identified novel qtl for so <dig> on gga <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  none of which overlapped between measurement phases, indicating separate genetic control of this trait dependent upon environmental temperature. a previous study using a commercial broiler line identified one on gga <dig>  <cit> . thus, qtl for so <dig> appear to be population specific.

glucose
phenotypic measurement
glucose is the body’s primary source of energy, and blood glu significantly decreased due to heat treatment in the current study. in contrast, male broilers had a significant increase in glu after heat stress at 32 °c for 10 h  <cit> , and in broiler chicks of 5 weeks of age at 35-40 °c  <cit> . in chicken lines divergently selected for blood glucose concentration, the low glucose line was less efficient at food utilization compared to the high glucose line  <cit> , which may indicate that the decrease in glucose we see during heat stress may contribute to inefficiency in food utilization.

heritability
the current study estimated heritabilities for glucose ranging between  <dig> - <dig> . in a study using chickens divergently selected for blood glucose concentration, heritability was estimated at  <dig>   <cit> .

gwas
we identified qtl for glu <dig> and glu <dig> on gga <dig>   <dig>  and z, while qtl were mapped to gga <dig>   <dig>  and z in the f <dig> generation of the same chicken population under thermoneutral conditions  <cit> . the two studies may have detected the same qtl on chromosome z and, due to the breakdown of ld over the generations, the current study may have mapped the qtl more accurately. in an f <dig> intercross between fat and lean broilers, qtl were identified for blood glucose on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  <cit> , and for fasting plasma glucose on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . a study using an f <dig> of broilers divergently selected for growth, identified qtl for plasma glucose on gga <dig> and gga <dig>  <cit> . thus, qtl location for blood glucose level appears to be heat and/or population specific.

pathway analysis
considering all measured traits, we identified a total of  <dig> unique qtl. all annotated genes within the qtl regions were used for pathway analysis using ipa and many significantly associated canonical pathways were identified including ampk signalling and angiopoietin signalling were identified. the top  <dig> pathways are found in table  <dig>  ampk is a master metabolic regulator involved in metabolism  <cit>  and, thus, may be a pathway which warrants further investigation for involvement in production traits during heat stress. during high ambient temperatures chickens redirect blood flow to the body surface to decrease body temperature  <cit> , and the angiopoietin signalling pathway functions in blood vessel development which may help alleviate temperature stress.

the co-localized regions resulted in many significant canonical pathways and the top  <dig> pathways are found table  <dig>  of particular interest is the cardiac hypertrophy signalling pathway . qtl for hemoglobin and hematocrit represent  <dig>  regions of co-localization and there is a positive linear relationship between hematocrit and heart weight in chickens under heat stress  <cit> ; therefore, this pathway likely contributes to the response to heat stress in chickens.

candidate genes for co-localized qtl
the qtl regions that co-localized for three or more traits were further investigated for positional, functional candidate genes to give further insight into the biological mechanisms involved in the response of blood components to heat stress. the identified genes are located in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

there are  <dig> genes in the region on gga <dig> between 3–6 mb that contained qtl for glu <dig>  pco <dig>  and tco228- <dig>  with  <dig> of these  <dig> traits associated with co <dig> concentration, ca <dig>  is a likely candidate gene involved in the co <dig> response to heat stress. carbonic anhydrases catalyse the reaction of co <dig> and h2o to form hco <dig> and h+, and thus may stabilize blood acid base balance during heat stress. another strong functional candidate in this region is hsp <dig>  a member of the heat shock protein family that functions as a molecular chaperone to prevent cellular damage during heat stress  <cit> . a candidate gene in this region for glucose level is gcnt <dig>  a glucosamine acetyl transferase which is associated with glucose metabolism in humans  <cit> .

fourteen genes were identified on gga <dig> between 16–17 mb, where qtls co-localized for ph28- <dig>  hct <dig>  hb <dig>  and k <dig>  many qtl in chicken have been identified in this region including those related to growth , abdominal fat  <cit> , and the stress-associated trait of fear response  <cit> . a strong candidate gene is aldh <dig>  which functions to convert aldehydes to carboxylic acids. this gene may function to maintain blood acid base balance during heat stress. another gene in this region is igf <dig> , which has many roles and is a biomarker for growth  <cit> .

four genes were identified on gga <dig> between 3– <dig> mbs, where qtl were co-localized for hct <dig>  hb <dig>  hb28- <dig>  and glu <dig>  to our knowledge, no qtl have been reported in this region. because all traits were measured during heat treatment or as the differential, we propose these to be heat specific qtl. candidate genes tgfa  and adra1a  both regulate cell growth. it is known that metabolic changes occur during periods of heat in chickens that contribute to reduction in growth, independent upon feed intake  <cit> .

there are  <dig> genes in the 1 mb region on gga <dig> between 3– <dig> mbs, where qtl co-localized for tco <dig>  k <dig>  and ica <dig>  notably, a qtl for tibia bone mineral density identified in a commercial broiler and layer cross is located within this region  <cit> . this co-localization suggests that this locus might be involved in both blood calcium and bone density, and therefore, may be an ideal candidate for further investigation to understand the physiological response to heat stress on bone mineral density.

there are  <dig> genes in the 2 mb region on gga <dig> between 3–5 mb where qtls co-localize for ph <dig>  hb <dig>  hct <dig>  pco <dig>  and pco228- <dig>  a qtl for heart weight, relating to susceptibility of pulmonary hypertension  <cit>  co-localizes with those identified here. many of these genes are related to membrane transport of solutes and dna transcription. the solute carriers slc39a <dig>  slc25a <dig> and slc35e <dig> were identified, as well as cherp and cib <dig>  involved in calcium homeostasis. transcription-related genes include sugp <dig>  which is involved in rna splicing; rfxank, a dna-binding protein; nr2c2ap, a nuclear receptor protein; ddx <dig>  an rna helicase; ell, an rna polymerase ii elongation factor; and sin3b a transcriptional regulator.

on ggaz,  <dig> genes were identified between 5– <dig> mbs, where qtl co-localize for glu <dig>  hco <dig>  and tco <dig>  the only reported qtl near this region is for antibody response to klh antigen  <cit> . heat stress is known to reduce antibody titre in chickens  <cit> , and this locus may be involved in the complex interaction of heat and antibody titre. although, antibody levels were not measured in the current study. during periods of heat stress, dna transcription, rna translation, and cellular proliferation are altered  <cit>  and we observed several genes in this region related to these particular responses including: kiaa <dig>  involved in chromosomal integrity during mitosis; and tpgs <dig>  involved in tubulin formation.

on ggaz,  <dig> genes were identified between 69– <dig> mbs, where qtl co-localize for glu <dig>  hco <dig>  and tco <dig>  the one qtl that is near this region was identified in a previous generation of the same ail as the current study, and is for bone mineral density  <cit> . a recent study found that heat stress in broilers results in decreased bone mineral density  <cit> . in humans, low serum bicarbonate levels are associated with decreased bone mineral density  <cit> . although this relationship has yet to be elucidated in the chicken, further studies should investigate the association between blood chemistry variables and bone mineral density. the genes identified in the current study that are primarily involved in dna transcription include xpa, which is a dna repair protein, foxe <dig> which is part of the forkhead box, and snora <dig> which is small nuclear rna. additionally, micrornas gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir- <dig>  and gga-mir- <dig> were identified in this region. an additional gene of interest identified was dnaja <dig>  which is part of the heat shock family of proteins.

qtl for blood components reveal orthologous genes between chicken and swine
qtl for blood pco <dig> in the current study were located on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in swine, qtl for blood pco <dig> are on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x  <cit> . we identified a region of synteny between chicken gga <dig>  110–111 mb, and pig chromosome x, 43–44 mb , which contains a pco <dig> qtl and several orthologous genes including fundc <dig>  efhc <dig>  ndp, and maoa. another region of synteny exists between chicken chromosome  <dig>  1–4 mb, and pig chromosome  <dig>  53–65 mb , which contains several orthologous genes including, but not limited to, ube2q <dig>  dnaj, gramd <dig>  adpgk, neo <dig>  clk <dig>  scamp <dig>  csk, and mpi. this region contains the carboxylic anhydrase gene  in chicken, which is involved in calcium metabolism, but this gene maps on pig chromosome  <dig>  a chromosome on which no qtl have been reported for blood chemistry measurements. the region on gga <dig>  1–4 mb, contains qtl for glu <dig>  pco <dig>  pco228- <dig>  and tco228- <dig>  the syntenic region in swine contains co-localized qtl for pco <dig>  hco <dig>  tco <dig>  and base excess  <cit> .fig.  <dig> syntenic regions between chicken and swine. syntenic regions between chicken and pig containing qtl for blood component traits. a qtl for pco <dig> in both chicken and pig. chicken qtl on gga <dig> at 110–111 mb in chicken syntenic with pig on chromosome x, 43–44 mb. b/c gga <dig> 1–2 mb in chicken and pig chromosome  <dig> 53–60 mb d. gga <dig> 16–17 mb and swine chromosome  <dig>  63–226 mb

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study contribute to the currently sparse knowledge of levels and heritabilities of several blood components under thermoneutral and heat stress conditions in chickens. most blood components changed in response to heat treatment. mapped qtl may serve as markers for genomic selection to enhance heat tolerance in poultry and several candidate genes were identified which may give additional insight into mechanisms of physiologic response to high ambient temperatures.
