BACKGROUND
much has been debated about the evolutionary role of genetic alterations in the regulation of gene expression . in that aspect, transcription factor binding sites  have recently been studied both in humans and other animals . several genome-wide analyses have identified regions close to genes  showing patterns of diversity in accordance with a model of positive selection  <cit> . in a recent study, arbiza et al.  <cit>  found that tfbs are under weaker selection than protein-coding regions of genes although these authors could observe several instances of adaptation in tfbs. in a similar way, vernot et al.  <cit>  have found hundreds of variations that are adaptive.

although these studies have shed some light on the evolutionary forces acting on tfbs and other regulatory elements, several issues remain poorly explored or even unexplored. one of them is the role of indels  as a source of genetic variability among tfbs. most of the few populational studies in this area are biased towards single nucleotide variants   <cit> . based on that, we decided to explore this issue by using three types of data recently made public. first, whole-genome sequences of more than a thousand human individuals from the  <dig> genomes project   <cit>  were used to identify polymorphic indels. second, a genome-wide identification of tfbs for  <dig> transcription factors from the encode  project  <cit>  was used to generate a catalogue of tfbs in the human genome. finally, expression data from a sub-set of individuals from the  <dig> genome project  <cit>  was used to evaluate the impact of tfbs-affecting indels  on the expression of the corresponding gene. integration of all these data allowed us to show a high frequency of tfbs-id in the human genome. hundreds of tfbs-id showed a differential frequency in human populations and ontology analyses of these cases suggested a role of natural selection and population history in their distribution. based on that, we argue that a tfbs-id has been selected in africans by down-regulating apip  and generating a better response to salmonella infection. a comparative analysis with genomic regions, known to be under positive selection  <cit> , revealed that a significant fraction of the tfbs-id identified by us represent instances of adaptation in human populations.

RESULTS
identification of tfbs-id
fig.  <dig> shows a schematic representation of the computational pipeline used in all analyses reported here. to build a catalogue of tfbs-id, we first indexed all tfbs identified by the encode project in the human reference genome . data from the  <dig> genomes project regarding the position of indels in the reference genome was then compared to the position of tfbs and those cases in which an indel overlapped with a tfbs were selected. this strategy rendered us a total of  <dig>  tfbs affected by at least one indel. since a significant fraction of tfbs overlap at the sequence level, the non-redundant number of tfbs-id in the above set was  <dig>  . due to the presence of long indels affecting many tfbs at once, we decided to limit our analysis to those indels shorter than 200 bp, which gave us a total of  <dig>  tfbs-id and  <dig>  tfbs. although the superior limit was set to 200 bp, the final set of  <dig>  tfbs-id is strongly biased towards shorter indels. more than  <dig>  % of all indels were equal or shorter than 20 bp. next, tfbs-id close  to the transcription start site  of known human genes  were selected. in total,  <dig>  human genes had at least one tfbs affected by a polymorphic indel in the  <dig> genomes dataset. this set of  <dig>  genes had a total of  <dig>  tfbs affected by indels and  <dig>  tfbs-id. a complete list of this dataset is available at additional file 1: table s <dig>  since many reports have also used a window that flanks the tss of known genes  <cit> , we have also defined a different window of same size  now encompassing  <dig>  kb in each side of a given tss. for this window, we found that  <dig>  human genes had at least one tfbs affected by a polymorphic indel in the  <dig> genomes dataset . the complete dataset found for the 5 kb window flanking tss can be found at additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis overview. schematic representation of the strategy used here to identify and analyse tfbs affected by polymorphic indels in human populations



tfbs-id showed a biased distribution in terms of location within both 5kbp windows proximal to the tss of known genes. as seen in fig.  <dig>  their distribution tend to be closer to the tss of genes   while in the window with the tss at center the distribution of tfbs-id is symmetrical with a slight higher frequency at the upstream half of the window . when we split the tfbs-id per type of transcription factor, the same biased distribution is observed for both windows, especially for some transcription factors .fig.  <dig> relative position of tfbs-ids within the 5 kb window adjacent to tss of human genes. overall distribution of tfbs-id in both the 5 kb window upstream of tss  and the 5 kb window flanking tss 



we were also interested in knowing what types of tf were more frequently interrupted by indels. a monte carlo simulation was performed testing the enrichment of specific tf within our tfbs final sets. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> transcription factors enriched for binding sites near genes  and affected by indels compared to all tf binding sites near genes. some of the tfs shown in table  <dig> have already been identified in other analyses. yokoyama et al.  <cit> , for example, have recently shown that hominid-specific binding sites for gata <dig> and ctcf are enriched near genes related to sensory-related function and neurological pathways. ctcf binding sites have also been shown to be under positive selection in several drosophila species  <cit> . pol <dig> has also been studied in humans and chimpanzees by kasowski et al.  <cit>  who found inter-species divergence in the respective binding affinities.table  <dig> transcription factors enriched in the set of tfbs-id close to the tss of known human genes. “tf” refers to the name of the transcription factor; “number of tfbs” refers to the number of binding sites for the respective tf within the tfbs-id set; “p-value” refers to the degree of significance for the respective tf enrichment with the final tfbs set against all tfbs near genes.

evaluation of the effect of tfbs-ids in the expression of corresponding genes
it has been shown that even small changes, like snvs, in tfbs affect the affinity of the corresponding transcription factor and consequently the expression of the associated gene  <cit> . therefore, we wondered whether the presence of an indel affecting at least one tfbs would change the expression pattern of the corresponding gene. rna-seq data for  <dig> individuals  from the geuvadis initiative  <cit>  was used to compare expression and genotype data for the same individual. a statistical analysis was performed to identify those genes whose presence of a tfbs-id was associated to a change in its expression . out of the  <dig>  genes with at least one tfbs-id in the 5 kb window upstream of tss,  <dig>  were informative for this expression survey. out of these  <dig>  genes we found that  <dig>  %  had its expression affected by the presence of a tfbs-id . this is significantly higher than expected by chance . for the window flanking the tss, we found that  <dig>  genes  had its expression affected by the presence of a tfbs-id . again, this is significantly higher than what one expect by chance . it is important to emphasize that the effect of the indel in the expression of the corresponding gene is certainly underestimated by our analysis since only one cell type was evaluated regarding expression. if a given gene is not expressed in the limphoblastoid cell lineage, no differential expression could be detected. the same is true regarding the expression of a given transcription factor whose binding site was affected by the indel.

what type of change is observed in the genes associated with a tfbs-id? for the 5 kb window upstream of tss, out of the  <dig>  genes whose expression was changed,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in the individuals carrying a certain tfbs-id, a significant difference from the null expectation . we could not observe any difference between the two datasets  regarding the type of transcription factors whose binding sites were affected by indels . for the 5 kb window flanking the tss, we found  <dig> and  <dig> up and down-regulated genes, respectively . like for the 5 kb window upstream of tss, there was no enrichment of any specific transcription factor in either gene set . in both situations, the sum of up and down-regulated genes does not match the total number of differentially expressed genes because few genes are present in both lists, due to their different behaviour depending on the composition of subjects with a given genotype.

tfbs-affecting indels with high differentiation between human populations
we next wondered whether we could identify in our set of tfbs-id alleles that present a high differentiation between human populations represented in the  <dig> genomes project. these frequency differences between populations are considered signatures of geographically restricted selection and have been used previously to identify regions under positive selection  <cit> . we restricted this analysis to a set of  <dig> individuals representing the three major continental groups:  <dig> africans ,  <dig> europeans  and  <dig> asians . to identify those indels with high differentiation between populations, we calculated the minimal frequency differences  of the derived alleles between all pairs of populations and took into consideration all differences ≥ 20 % . this threshold was based in statistical analysis of the distribution of all δ reported here, in which 20 % represents about two standard deviation from the mean .

for the tfbs-id identified in the 5 kb window upstream of tss, this analysis generated a set of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tfbs-ids that have a significant δ in afr, eur and asn, respectively. when expression data is taken into consideration,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tfbs-id  seem to affect the expression of the corresponding genes in afr, asn and eur, respectively. table  <dig> reports the top  <dig> tfbs-id with highest differentiation for all three populations. a complete list is presented at additional file 5: table s <dig>  for the tfbs-id identified in the 5 kb window flanking tss, we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that have a significant δ in afr, eur and asn, respectively. a complete list for the tfbs-id identified in the 5 kb window flanking tss is presented at additional file 6: table s <dig> table  <dig> tfbs-id within the 5 kb window upstream of tss and with highest δ in afr, asn or eur.

one interesting gene found in our analysis is mc1r, known to be associated with skin pigmentation in humans  <cit> . a tfbs-id  associated to this gene has a higher allelic frequency in afr  and asn  when compared to eur . this supports the suggestion from vernot et al.  <cit>  that regulatory polymorphisms, under recent selection, have an influence in pigmentation phenotypes. another gene reported to have a tfbs-id with a differential frequency is vdac <dig>  a voltage-dependent channel essential for sperm mobility  <cit> . we found a tfbs-id  with a higher frequency in afr , as similarly reported by colonna et al.  <cit>  for a different polymorphism in the same gene.

taste perception has been crucial in human evolution especially for the detection of toxins. not surprisingly, bitter taste receptors have been show to be under positive selection in human populations  <cit> . our analysis  shows that a tfbs-id associated with tas1r <dig>  a sweet receptor, shows a high δ in asn. shi and zhang  <cit>  concluded, based in a comparison of several vertebrate species, that both bitter and sweet receptors are under positive selection. tas1r <dig> is also a component of the dimeric protein tas1r1/tas1r <dig>  which is the umami taste receptor  <cit> . the umami taste is a common feature of many foods in asia and is reasonable to speculate that this variant is being selected in asians  <cit> .

response to parasites and microbes has been constantly subject to adaptations in human evolution  <cit> . we found a tfbs-id  with a higher allelic frequency in afr . the gene associated with this tfbs-id is apip  whose protein has been shown to be an inhibitor of pyroptosis and apoptosis, both a response to salmonella infection  <cit> . based on that it is predicted that the tfbs-id would cause a decrease in apip expression. indeed, fig. 3a shows that expression of apip decreases significantly in individuals homozygous for the tfbs-id . we propose here that this tfbs-id is under positive selection in afr due to a down-regulation of apip <dig> and consequently a better response to salmonella infection. fig. 3b shows that a selective sweep analysis supports this proposal. individuals homozygous for the presence of the tfbs-id show a decreased genetic heterogeneity around the tfbs-id position .fig.  <dig> apip expression is likely adapted in afr. a tfbs-id  with a δ =  <dig>  in africans and associated with the apip gene affects gene expression as seen in a. in b, individuals homozygous for the tfbs-id  had a lower genetic heterogeneity around the indel position  when compared to individuals homozygous for absence of the indel 



to gain further insights on what types of genes are associated with tfbs-id showing a high differentiation between the three human populations, an ontology analysis was performed. fig.  <dig> shows the major go categories enriched  in the dataset of genes associated to tfbs-id for each of the three populations used in this study . two go categories were enriched in all three populations: “regulation of transcription” and “histone 3’ end mrna processing”. “urea transport” is enriched in both asn and eur. all the other categories are enriched only in one population, as seen in fig.  <dig>  overall, there are a large number of categories related to immunological response. interesting categories enriched in africans and asians are “response to protozoans” and “response to biotic stimulus”, respectively. in europeans one enriched category is “uv protection”, known to be under positive selection in this population  <cit> . for the 5 kb window flanking the tss, some of the categories seen for the 5 kb window upstream of tss are still present  although several categories clearly linked to recent selection in humans are missing.fig.  <dig> ontology analysis for genes associated to tfbs-id with δ > =  <dig>  in the respective population . color of the circle refers to the p-value of the enrichment while size of the circle refers to the numbers of genes within that go category



tfbs-id match regions known to be under positive selection in the human genome
in the last few years, several genome-wide strategies have been used to identify regions in the human genome that are under positive selection  <cit> . the recent availability of data from the  <dig> genomes project has catalysed such approach and hundreds of regions have been identified. to evaluate whether our set of tfbs-ids correspond to genetic units that are under selection, a comparison was made with one of the most complete, in terms of the number of metrics used, of such studies  <cit> .

when we compared our total set of  <dig>  tfbs-id close to the  <dig>  human genes , we found that  <dig>   matched regions under selection as defined by pybus et al.  <cit>  within a 95 % confidence interval. with a 99 % confidence interval, we found  <dig> tfbs-ids  that matched genomic regions under selection. for the 5 kb window flanking tss, we found that  <dig>   tfbs-id match regions under selection within a 95 % confidence interval. with a 99 % confidence interval we found  <dig>   tfbs-id matching regions under selection. fig.  <dig> shows the results for a gene ontology enrichment analysis  with the set of  <dig> tfbs-id  that matched genomic regions under selection. three major categories are evident: ontologies associated with immunological responses, response to radiation and haematological/cardiac processes. all these processes have been shown to be under recent positive selection in humans  <cit> . for the set of  <dig>  tfbs-id matching genomic regions under selection and within the 5 kb window flanking the tss, we found while some categories are still present, when compared to the 5 kb window upstream of tss, several differences exist . overall, the gene ontology analysis presented here  suggests that the inclusion of a region downstream of tss diluted the selection signal observed for the 5 kb window upstream of tss. this in in accordance with a recent finding from the gtex consortium about a higher frequency of eqtls located upstream of tss  <cit> .fig.  <dig> go enrichment analysis for tfbs-id matching regions known to be under selection in the human genome . color of the bars refers to the p-value of the respective enrichment. length of the bar refers to the number of genes within the respective go category



CONCLUSIONS
by integrating different types of data, we provide a comprehensive catalogue of polymorphic indels affecting tfbs in the human genome. overall, our findings support the notion that regulatory variation has been important during human evolution. some of the genes associated with these tfbs-affecting indels have been previously identified as targets of positive selection in human populations. the remaining set of genes and indels, however, represents a rich source of new information related to human evolution. we envisage that this dataset, together with the ones previously reported, will catalyse a series of new investigations on how recent human evolution has shaped gene regulatory networks.
