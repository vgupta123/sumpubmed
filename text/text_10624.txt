BACKGROUND
hyperthermophiles constitute a group of microorganisms with an optimum growth temperature of between 80°c and 100°c. proteins isolated to date are composed of the common  <dig> amino acids. furthermore, homologous proteins from hyperthermophiles and mesophiles typically show 40–85% sequence similarity and their three-dimensional structures are superposable  <cit> , suggesting that the factors underlying the extreme thermal tolerance are hidden in the delicate balance of the non-covalent interactions.

although the molecular underpinnings of protein thermostabilization have been the focus of many theoretical and experimental efforts, the properties leading to the higher denaturation temperature of proteins from hyperthermophiles are still controversial  <cit> . among the large number of factors identified as responsible for the thermostability of proteins from hyperthermophiles, electrostatic interactions have been proposed to be a universally important factor. a comparison of  <dig> structural parameters calculated from the tertiary structures of  <dig> proteins from mesophiles and  <dig> proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles indicated that increases in the numbers of charged residues and ion pairs with increasing growth temperature and other parameters show just such a trend  <cit> . a theoretical analysis of charge interactions calculated using the tanford-kirkwood model applied to the protein crystal structures also demonstrated a correlation between electrostatic interactions and thermostability  <cit> . however, estimates of the energy contribution of an ion pair to protein stability have led to conflicting conclusions, ranging from stabilizing, through insignificant, to destabilizing effects  <cit> .

estimates of the energy contributions of ion pairs and net charges to protein stability could also be achieved by changing environmental variables such as ph and salt concentration  <cit> . the stability of the pyrococcus furiosus methyl aminopeptidase decreased at low ph, where the acidic residues are protonated and favorable ionic interactions are disrupted, as well as at high salt concentration, where high ionic strength is known to destabilize ion pairs  <cit> . it was also found that nacl destabilizes sulfolobus solfataricus carboxypeptidase at ph  <dig> , but not at ph  <dig> , where the stabilizing ion pairs probably do not exist any more. these and other similar experiments were considered to support the suggestion that ion pairs are an essential factor contributing to the thermostability of proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles  <cit> .

the dna binding protein ssh10b, from the archaeon sulfolobus shibattae with an optimal growth temperature of 95°c, is a member of the sac10b family and is conserved in most thermophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeal genomes that have been sequenced to date. the protein constitutes about 4–5% of the cellular protein, binds dsdna without apparent sequence specificity, and is capable of constraining negative dna supercoils in a temperature-dependent fashion. this binding ability is weak at 25°c, but is enhanced substantially at 45°c and higher temperatures. ssh10b is a dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits. the monomer of ssh10b consists of  <dig> amino acid residues with no disulfide bonds and is highly thermostable  <cit> . the crystal structure of ssh10b revealed a mixed α/β structure comprising four β-strands and two α-helixes  <cit> . in a previous study, we found that ssh10b is resistant to urea-induced denaturation in phosphate buffer   <cit> . in the present study, we report the effects of ph and salt concentration on the urea-induced denaturation of ssh10b in monovalent ion buffer.

RESULTS
ph- and salt-dependent unfolding by urea
within the ph range  <dig> to  <dig>  the cd spectra of native ssh10b in high ionic strength phosphate buffer   <cit>  were nearly identical with just a slight difference below  <dig> nm, indicating that the protein was stable over this ph range. ssh10b was resistant to urea-induced denaturation in phosphate buffer   <cit> , but showed ph- and salt-dependent stability toward urea denaturation in the monovalent ion buffer. at 25°c, we analyzed urea-induced unfolding at five different ph values  and at eight different salt concentrations . at low nacl concentrations  the cd signal at  <dig> nm showed a two-state cooperative unfolding transition, while at high salt concentrations  ssh10b was resistant to urea-induced denaturation. figure  <dig> shows a typical profile of the ellipticity as function of urea concentration. at ph < <dig>  the protein was slightly unfolded, while at ph > <dig>  the urea-unfolded protein irreversibly aggregated . fitting the curves separately yields m values of around  <dig>  ±  <dig> kj mol-1m- <dig> . the unfolding free energies, Δg, were obtained by fitting the transition curves to equation  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  the protein stability increased with increasing ph and salt concentration. in the absence of nacl, the unfolding Δg of the protein increased from about  <dig> kj/mol at ph  <dig> to about  <dig> kj/mol at ph  <dig>  at all values of ph used, the Δg was observed to increase with increasing nacl concentration. at ph  <dig>  the unfolding Δg of the protein increased from about  <dig> kj/mol in the absence of nacl to about  <dig> kj/mol in the presence of  <dig>  m nacl; while at ph  <dig>  the increase was from about  <dig> kj/mol in the absence of nacl to about  <dig> kj/mol in the presence of  <dig>  m nacl , implying that increasing ph or nacl concentration have similar effects on the protein stability.

acid/base titration of native ssh10b monitored by potentiometry
potentiometric h+ titrations at 25°c are shown in figure  <dig>  the inset in figure  <dig> shows the original titration plot. the equivalents of naoh used in the titration were subtracted from the equivalents of naoh used in a control experiment. the control experiment consisted of a sample of degassed water using an identical titration protocol described above, but with no protein in the sample. the ssh10b concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml. the moles of h+ bound per mole of protein was calculated according to equation  <dig> from the titration volume, the normality of the titrant, and the number of moles  of protein. for convenience, the number of titrated protons at ph  <dig>  was arbitrarily set to zero. the results demonstrated that  <dig> of  <dig> structurally resolved protonated groups in ssh10b  were neutralized over the ph range 4– <dig>  since ssh10b contains  <dig> tyr and no his or cys residues, the presence of  <dig> titratable residues in the ph range 4– <dig> indicates that the pka values of the ionizable residues are different in the native and unfolded proteins  <cit> .

ph-dependent unfolding by gdnhcl in monovalent ionic buffer
at ph  <dig>  when the concentration of nacl is greater than  <dig>  m, the protein was resistant to denaturation by urea. due to the limitation of the urea solubility, determining the unfolding Δg at high salt concentration was not possible. for comparison, we also analyzed gdnhcl-induced unfolding in the ph range  <dig> to  <dig> in monovalent ion buffer. upon incubation in  <dig> m gdnhcl for  <dig> h at 25°c, ssh10b showed a significant reduction in backbone cd signal. the data were fitted to a two-state model  and the ph value, free energy changes for unfolding ), slope , and mid-point for gdnhcl denaturation  are summarized in table  <dig>  the results show that the denaturant m value increases slightly with increasing ph, from  <dig>  at ph  <dig> to  <dig>  at ph  <dig>  and then the m value decreases slightly with further increase in ph, to about  <dig> at ph  <dig>  the m value is relatively constant with changing ph, suggesting that there is no obvious population of an intermediate during unfolding  <cit> . that the m value for gdnhcl denaturation is about double that for urea denaturation is in agreement with general observation  <cit> . it is interesting to notice that the m value for gdnhcl denaturation is also buffer-dependent. the m value for gdnhcl denaturation is about  <dig> kj mol-1m- <dig> in phosphate buffer  <cit> , about  <dig>  kj mol-1m- <dig> in mops buffer  <cit> , and about  <dig> kj mol-1m- <dig> in hepes buffer .

the unfolding free energies, Δg, are shown in figure  <dig>  it is clear that the value of Δg fluctuated slightly with changes in the ph. a maximum stability of ssh10b of about  <dig> kj/mol was observed in the ph range 4– <dig> at 25°c, which is only about  <dig> kj/mol higher than that at low  ph, where the electrostatic interactions of the ion-pairs are disrupted. the observation of small changes in the thermodynamic parameters measured by gdnhcl denaturation in the ph range 1– <dig> suggests that the ionization state of the residues had little effect on the stability of the ssh10b protein.

discussion
the crystal structure of ssh10b reveals that the monomer of the protein consists of  <dig> ionizable residues , all of which are surface-exposed, except the two residues tyr <dig> and glu54; there are salt bridges involving glu36-lys <dig>  glu54-arg <dig>  asp63-lys <dig>  and glu66-arg <dig> and an ion-pair network involving lys40-glu91-arg71-glu <dig>  <cit> . the number of ionizable residues is clearly higher than the average value, which is around five ion-pairs per  <dig> residues of protein  <cit> .

at ph < <dig>   <cit> , ssh10b has net positive charges on the protein surface. the charge-charge interactions between the positive charges are repulsive and unfavorable for the folded protein. the protein should adopt a structure that will optimize the charge-charge interactions and reduce the repulsive forces. since ssh10b contains only  <dig> tyr and no his or cys residues, the presence of  <dig> titratable residues in the dimeric protein in the ph range 4– <dig> indicates that the pka values of the ionizable residues are different between the native and unfolded protein with the pka values downshifted for the alkaline residues lys and arg  <cit> . in the ph range 4– <dig>  with the increase of ph, the alkaline residues lys and arg with the downshifted pka values could be gradually neutralized, resulting in a decrease in the net positive charge and enhancement of the protein stability. this is consist with the experimental observation: in the absence of nacl and in low ionic strength buffer, the stability of ssh10b exhibited a strong ph dependence, and the unfolding Δg of the protein increased from about  <dig> kj/mol at ph  <dig> to about  <dig> kj/mol at ph  <dig>  showing that the increased number of charged residues in thermophilic ssh10b does not contribute to the increased stability of the folded protein.

it has long been understood that salt has a significant impact on the stability of proteins by altering the interactions of the aqueous solvent with the protein through preferential hydration, called the hofmeister effect, as well as by screening electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the protein surface  <cit> . since the interactions between charges of ssh10b are predominantly repulsive at ph 4– <dig>  then salt will have a stronger screening effect on these interactions and will serve to stabilize the folded protein , agreeing well with the experimental observation that the unfolding Δg increased with increasing salt concentration.

urea and gdnhcl denaturation curves are generally used to obtain an estimate of the protein free energy. the reasons for differences in the parameters obtained by urea and gdnhcl-induced denaturation have been extensively discussed  <cit> . it is well understood that gdnhcl is a salt and, therefore it is expected to ionize in aqueous solution, while urea is not. the gdn+ and cl- ions could mask the charged residues and screen electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the protein surface. if the charge-charge interactions are repulsive, the unfolding Δg obtained by urea-induced denaturation should be lower than that obtained by gdnhcl-induced denaturation; while if the interactions are attractive, the unfolding Δg obtained by urea-induced denaturation should be higher than that obtained by gdnhcl-induced denaturation. we observed that the unfolding Δg obtained by urea-induced denaturation is smaller than that obtained by gdnhcl-induced denaturation. in addition, the value obtained by gdnhcl-induced denaturation in hepes buffer  is smaller than that in phosphate buffer   <cit> , which also supports the suggestion that the increased number of charged residues in thermophilic ssh10b does not contribute to the increased stability of the folded protein.

our results indicate that the ionizable residues and ion-pairs probably do not play a major role in stability of the native ssh10b protein. what is their role? several recent studies have shown that charge-charge interactions influence the denatured state ensemble and contribute to protein stability  <cit> . when both the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions that stabilize the folded state are disrupted, the unfolded polypeptide chain rearranges to more compact conformations with favorable long-range electrostatic interactions. in general, a compact denatured ensemble results in a decrease in the change in solvent-accessible area, Δasa, between the native and the unfolded proteins. across many protein folding systems, there is a correlation between the m value and Δasa, as well as between the number of residue and Δasa  <cit> . the ssh10b dimer consists of  <dig> amino acid residues. this predicts a Δasa value of  <dig> and an m value of about  <dig> kj mol-1m- <dig> for urea denaturation, which is appreciably larger than that determined experimentally . tanford showed that the m value depends on the groups in a protein that are buried in the native state but exposed to solvent in the denatured state  <cit> . that the experimentally determined m value is smaller than the theoretically predicted value suggests a denatured protein with a compact ensemble. this is consistent with the results in previous study. it was found that the value of the heat capacity change, Δcp, of ssh10b unfolding with the value of  <dig> j t- <dig> mol residue- <dig> is significantly smaller than that of the average value for proteins from mesophiles  or the value calculated from the ssh10b structural data , suggesting a denatured protein with compact ensemble  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
these findings suggest that the increased number of charged residues and ion pairs in protein ssh10b from hyperthermophiles does not contribute to the increased stability of the folded protein, but may affect the denatured state ensemble leading to the enhanced denaturation temperature.
