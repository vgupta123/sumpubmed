BACKGROUND
the glaucomas are a multifactorial group of diseases with many different causes and one common endpoint: the loss of retinal ganglion cells of the retina, leading to thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and deficits in the visual field  <cit> . ocular hypertension is the leading risk factor for glaucoma  <cit> . for human patients presenting with glaucoma, treatments that lower intraocular pressure are effective, even in cases where intraocular pressure is not abnormally elevated  <cit> . in animal models, interventions that produce elevated intraocular pressure lead to predictable retinal ganglion cell loss  <cit> .

astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the adult central nervous system. normally, astrocytes provide metabolic and structural support to neurons and participate in the maintenance and detoxification of the extracellular space of the central nervous system. in neurodegenerative diseases or following central nervous system injury, quiescent astrocytes acquire a reactive phenotype and produce many enzymes, proteins, cytokines, and free radicals that are not produced under normal conditions  <cit> .

as part of the change from quiescent astrocytes to reactive astrocytes, glaucomatous optic nerve head astrocytes exhibit differential expression of a large number of genes  <cit> . reactive astrocytes in glaucomatous eyes may initially represent a cellular attempt to limit the extent of neuronal injury and to promote tissue repair, but reactive glial cells may also have noxious effects on optic nerve axons by creating mechanical injury and/or changing the microenvironment of neurons  <cit> . previous studies from our laboratory reported that genes related to lipid synthesis and metabolism, steroid metabolism and glutathione metabolism were upregulated in optic nerve head astrocytes cultured from patients with primary open angle glaucoma  <cit> . in addition, reactive astrocytes in the glaucomatous optic nerve head engage in extracellular matrix  remodeling of the lamina cribrosa  <cit>  leading to the cupping or excavation of the optic disc characteristic of glaucoma  <cit> .

our working model of damage in ocular hypertensive glaucoma states that abnormally elevated intraocular pressure converts normal optic nerve head astrocytes to "reactive" astrocytes, which are characterized by the increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein   <cit> , a member of the intermediate filament family uniquely expressed by astrocytes and considered to be a hallmark of central nervous system injury  <cit> . there is evidence that elevated hydrostatic pressure can directly trigger astrocytes to assume the reactive phenotype  <cit> .

several recent studies have used whole genome microarrays to catalog changes in transcription that accompany glaucoma. these have included the analysis of primary cultures of human optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous donors  <cit> ; cultured human optic nerve head astrocytes from normal donors exposed to pressure for varying periods of time  <cit> ; optic nerve head cells from a rat model of glaucoma  <cit> ; and the retinal cells of several animal models of glaucoma, including the dba/2j mouse  <cit> , the cynomolgus macaque  <cit> , and the rat  <cit> . there are substantial transcriptional differences between cells in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . due to the unique anatomy and sophistication of the primate lamina cribrosa, nonhuman primate models are preferred for glaucoma research and replicate the disease with the highest fidelity  <cit> . this is because the nonhuman primate visual system, including the structure of the optic nerve head, is nearly identical to that of human  <cit> . this contrasts with mice, which do not have a lamina cribrosa, and rats, which have a very primitive lamina cribrosa  <cit> . the primate model develops visual field deficits and cupping that are indistinguishable from those in human glaucoma  <cit> . for the present study, we used a nonhuman primate model to investigate transcriptional changes in the cells of the optic nerve head during experimental glaucoma. high-density oligonucleotide microarrays identified global transcriptional changes in the nonhuman primate optic nerve head. we then compared these findings to the genes that are altered in immuno-enriched cultures of optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous human donors.

evaluation of damage
fundus photographs are shown for samples  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . these samples gave a representative picture of the progression of glaucomatous enlargement of the rim of the optic nerve head and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer.

further in vivo evaluation of retinal nerve fiber layer  thickness was made with the gdx vcc scanning laser polarimetry  with variable corneal compensation . slp is an ocular imaging technique based on the birefringence of the rnfl, and has been used to obtain reproducible quantitative measurements of the rnfl in human and monkey eyes  <cit> . the gdx vcc has a variable corneal polarization compensator  that allows for individual eye birefringence compensation, which increases the accuracy of the rnfl thickness assessment. gdxvcc images are color coded for thickness. darker colors  represent thinner areas of rnfl and bright colors  represent thicker areas. differences in slp parameters between the experimental glaucoma  eyes and healthy control eyes of the samples were assessed to quantify rnfl damage. thinning in the typical glaucomatous, "hourglass" shape  <cit>  was evident, with images showing more pronounced change from orange to blue coloration in the superior and inferior regions.

to further quantify disease progression, axon loss was measured from cross-sections of the optic nerve of each sample processed for microarray analysis .

remapping of probe set definitions to affymetrix human microarrays
recent improvements in sequencing and genomic analysis have led to more accurate "definitions" that relate oligonucleotide sequences on the affymetrix arrays to expressed rnas  <cit> . we used these more accurate definitions  to update the probe sets of the affymetrix hgu133a and hgu133av <dig> oligonucleotide microarrays used in this study. limited genomic information is available for the cynomolgus macaque, the species used for this study. however, the close evolutionary relationship of humans and chimpanzees to the macaque permits microarray analysis using human chips and gene definitions from either humans or chimpanzees. because the cynomolgus macaque is evolutionarily approximately equidistant from humans and chimpanzees, there is theoretically no advantage in using either the human or the chimpanzee definitions for the analysis of transcripts from the macaque. we performed the microarray analysis in duplicate, using definitions for both human and chimpanzee. the affymetrix detection call algorithm reliably eliminates probe sets that, due to sequence variations between species, do not hybridize accurately  <cit> . it was used to eliminate false hybridization signals . as our most compelling targets were verified using qrt-pcr, any candidates generated with either of the two sets of definitions could be verified with this more precise technique. using human unigene-based definitions,  <dig>  probesets were detected in 16/ <dig> arrays, and  <dig>  probesets were detected in 14/ <dig> arrays ; using chimpanzee unigene-based definitions,  <dig>  probesets were detected in 16/ <dig> arrays, and  <dig>  probesets were detected in 14/ <dig> arrays .

results of statistical testing
when comparing microarray data from the five expg eyes with the control group of eight eyes, the unigene-based chimpanzee definitions identified  <dig> significant, differentially expressed probe sets, and the unigene-based human definitions produced  <dig> significant, differentially expressed probe sets . nineteen significant, differentially expressed probe sets were shared between the two groups. human definitions identified guanine nucleotide-binding protein, gamma-transducing activity polypeptide  <dig> , which was likely introduced as a retina-specific contaminant during the dissection  <cit> . chimpanzee definitions identified phosducin , also likely a retina-specific contaminant  <cit> . for this reason, gngt <dig> and pdc were removed from further consideration. fold change  and standard error of fold change were nearly identical for transcripts identified using both definitions.

'definition' indicates the species definitions used; 'hs' indicates human; 'pt' indicates chimpanzee. for transcripts identified by both definitions , the data shown in the table was produced using the human definition. fold change  and standard error of fold change were calculated as described in methods. 'rp' indicates p-values generated by rank products; 'sam' indicates p-values generated by significance analysis of microarrays. 'onh astrocyte' and 'rgc' indicate probable expression in optic nerve head astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells, respectively ; 'na' indicates no data were available.

the same analysis was performed after omitting the two most advanced glaucoma samples  to identify differentially expressed probe sets that were preferentially expressed during the mild stages of experimental glaucoma .

this comparison was performed to preferentially identify transcripts that changed during the mild stages of glaucomatous axonal damage. samples  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had axonal losses ranging from 25%â32%  and were tested separately. results are shown here. samples  <dig> and  <dig> had more severe axonal loss  and were excluded from this comparison. 'definition' indicates the species definitions used; 'hs' indicates human; 'pt' indicates chimpanzee. for transcripts identified by both definitions , the data shown in the table were produced using the human definition. fold change  and standard error of fold change were calculated as described in methods. 'rp' indicates indicates p-values generated by rank products; 'sam' indicates indicates p-values generated by significance analysis of microarrays. 'onh astrocyte' and 'rgc' indicate probable expression in optic nerve head astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells, respectively ; 'na' indicates no data were available.

prediction of cell types expressing differentially expressed genes
we were most interested in genes differentially expressed by optic nerve head astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells during experimental glaucoma. to estimate which genes were expressed by optic nerve head astrocytes, detection call information from previously published affymetrix datasets from this laboratory was used  <cit> . retinal ganglion cell expression data from one est and one microarray study was obtained, respectively, from  <cit>  and  <cit> . both microarray tables include columns with optic nerve head astrocyte and retinal ganglion cell expression data for the significant transcripts .

validation of selected differentially expressed genes by real-time rt-pcr
transcripts selected from table  <dig> , table  <dig> , or the results of individual paired comparisons   were confirmed by quantitative real time pcr in the two most mild  and two most advanced  experimental, paired samples. results are shown in table  <dig> as relative gene expression values  between the laser-treated eye and the normal contralateral eye. there was good correlation between the quantitative real time pcr data and the microarray results. primer sequences are provided .

qrt-pcr verification in four paired glaucomatous macaques of eight selected transcripts. fold change  was calculated within each paired sample as described in methods. standard error of fold change was calculated as described in methods.

numerical values for microarray are from human definitions, with the exception of gpnmb, which was not detected by human definitions.

histological confirmation of selected genes
to further investigate genes identified by microarray, laser treated cynomolgus and rhesus macaque samples with mild to moderate axon loss  were processed for immunohistochemistry with antibodies to growth-associated protein  <dig> , glycoprotein transmembrane non-metastatic b , and neurofilament heavy . gpnmb was chosen because it is a null mutation in the dba/2j mouse strain, which develops iris pigment dispersion syndrome and iris stromal atrophy; the former was mapped to a premature stop mutation in gpnmb  <cit> ; nefh and gap <dig> were chosen because they are markers of axonal regrowth  <cit> , which has not been previously described in a primate glaucoma model.

two nefh antibodies were used to examine the localization of upregulated nefh in the axons of optic nerves of healthy and experimental glaucoma monkeys. nefh immunohistochemistry with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated nefh shows axons in the normal sample traversing through the lamina cribrosa in well-organized bundles , while the axons in expg were disorganized with an abnormal axonal morphology . staining with an antibody that recognizes predominantly phosphorylated nefh revealed presumptive growth cone-like structures in the post laminar optic nerves of monkeys with experimental glaucoma, which also were positive for gap <dig> , whereas these structures were absent in control monkeys. optic nerve astrocytes expressed abundant gap- <dig> in expg. stathmin+ oligodendrocyte processes encircled the axonal bulbs in expg . the growth cone-like structures were observed in all expg optic nerves examined. double staining with nefh and protein disulfide isomerase , a marker of endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, suggested new protein synthesis in axons  <cit>  and glial cells in the optic nerve .

gpnmb immunohistochemistry is shown in figure  <dig>  in control samples, gpnmb protein was detected in the retinal ganglion cell and nerve fiber layers of the retina . in expg samples, gpnmb protein was sharply upregulated in retinal ganglion cells and their axons, and in retinal astrocytes in the retinal nerve fiber layer . within the optic nerve head, healthy samples had baseline expression levels of gpnmb protein in astrocytes and retinal ganglion cell axons . in expg samples, gpnmb was sharply upregulated in retinal ganglion cells and their axons, as well as optic nerve head astrocytes . gpnmb staining appeared to localize to the membranes of gfap+ astrocytes. in contrast, gfap+ astrocytes in the lamina cribrosa exhibited strong gpnmb staining where, at higher magnification, gpnmb protein could be seen around and over the nucleus in expg. abundant gpnmb was also present in axons in the nerve bundles at the level of the lamina cribrosa . low levels of gpnmb were present in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and nerve fibers in the myelinated post laminar optic nerve in normal and in expg 

labeling with stathmin  antibody revealed specific upregulation of stmn in expg. within the retina, stmn immunoreactivity was very low in normal eyes . in expg, stmn was detected in the nerve fiber layer and in few gfap-negative process-bearing cells. retinal ganglion cells and retinal astrocytes did not exhibit stmn immunoreactivity . in the prelaminar optic nerve head, low levels of stmn were expressed in the glial columns and in the nerve bundles in both control and expg samples without obvious differences . in both control and expg, stmn expression was absent from the lamina cribrosa and present in the optic nerve proper. oligodendrocytes exhibited strong immunoreactivity for stmn in the somata and cell processes . in expg, many oligodendrocytes exhibited bipolar shape with long processes . in control eyes stmn stained the nerve bundles, but not in expg . positive staining with adenomatous polyposis coli  identified these cells as oligodendrocytes . stmn was not expressed in gfap+ astrocytes in the myelinated nerve.

these results were consistent amongst all the samples, as were the negative controls for specificity of the primary and secondary antibodies. staining in cynomolgus onh was not different from the rhesus onh samples.

confirmation of the expression of selected genes in human optic nerve head astrocytes
qrt-pcr was used to examine the expression of gpnmb, rbp <dig>  capg, apoe, tgfbi, and timp <dig>  which were identified in the nonhuman primate model, in immuno-enriched optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous caucasian american donors . figure  <dig> shows qrt-pcr confirmation of differential expression of the five genes in immuno-enriched optic nerve head astrocytes from healthy and glaucomatous human donors. capg, gpnmb, rbp <dig>  apoe and timp <dig> were significantly upregulated in astrocytes from glaucomatous donors, consistent with their upregulation in the tissues of the macaque optic nerve head with expg. tgfbi was upregulated significantly by microarray , but not by qrt-pcr . two genes, nefh and gpnmb, exhibited higher fold increases in samples with moderate to advanced glaucoma. in sample  <dig>  gpnmb variation may be due to infiltration of the onh with microglia or macrophages, as has been previously reported in advanced glaucoma in humans  <cit> . the higher nefh increase in sample  <dig> may be due to retinal contamination or to higher iop exposure in that spontaneous glaucoma compared to the laser treated samples.

discussion
we used the nonhuman primate model of glaucoma to investigate transcriptional changes occurring at the optic nerve head, the region thought to be the primary site of damage to retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma  <cit> . we validated selected transcripts with qrt-pcr, which generally agreed with microarray in direction and, to a lesser degree, magnitude. our data was consistent with others' observations that larger fold changes in affymetrix chips, with updated definitions  <cit> , correlated best with qrt-pcr  <cit> . in addition, we used human optic nerve head astrocytes from normal and glaucomatous human donors to demonstrate independent upregulation of five putative astrocyte genes selected from the microarray data in monkeys with experimental glaucoma.

previous studies have shown that updated sequence definitions for affymetrix genechips produced improved estimates of differential expression  <cit> . in the present study, updated definitions produced more 'present' transcripts by the detection call algorithm  <cit>  , indicating that more hybridized transcripts were accurately detected.

significant differentially expressed transcripts could be divided into five categories, and some have putative or established roles in multiple categories. axonal elongation and synaptic plasticity genes, including growth-associated protein  <dig> , neurofilament heavy , and neuritin  <dig> , preferentially expressed by retinal ganglion cells, indicated an attempt to re-extend lost or damaged axons. there was an upregulation of neuroprotective genes, including apolipoprotein e , cellular retinol binding protein  <dig> , and pigment epithelium derived factor . we confirmed the upregulation of rbp <dig> in immuno-enriched optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous human donors. this suggested that optic nerve head astrocytes attempted to facilitate retinal ganglion cell axon outgrowth by upregulation of neuroprotective molecules. differential expression of motility genes, including capping protein g  and transforming growth factor beta-induced , was consistent with the reactive, migratory astrocyte phenotype characteristic of glaucoma  <cit> , as were ecm remodeling genes, such as gpnmb  <cit>  and timp <dig>  <cit> . immune genes, such as tyro protein tyrosine kinase binding protein , major histocompatibility complex class ii dm alpha , major histocompatibility complex class ii dp beta  <dig> , and major histocompatibility complex class ii dr alpha , were likely expressed by infiltrating mononuclear cells, resident microglia, macrophages, and possibly also astrocytes acting as non-professional antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . the most compelling candidates for investigation are discussed further below in the context of glaucoma.

the appearance of gap43+ and phospho-nefh+ growth cone-like structures in the optic nerve has not been previously reported in the nonhuman primate model or in human glaucoma. it is thought that primate retinal ganglion cells do not regenerate damaged axons in vivo, including in glaucoma  <cit> . however, axon regeneration, accompanied by new protein synthesis in axons, was reported in dorsal root ganglia  <cit> . our finding suggests that there may be plasticity in the adult primate optic nerve and possibly a window period, early in hypertensive glaucoma, when retinal ganglion cell axons attempt to regenerate. if true, this would underscore the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment of glaucoma, as post-mortem histological studies have shown that up to half of retinal ganglion cells are typically lost in glaucoma before any visual field defects are present. alternatively, these structures may represent retraction bulbs that are characteristic of the disorganized microtubule network of damaged axons  <cit> . future experiments will distinguish between these possibilities.

capping protein g  is a member of the gelsolin-villin family, and modulates cellular motility by capping actin filaments  <cit> . the importance of astrocyte motility in the progression of glaucoma is a present focus of investigation  <cit> ; the upregulation of capg in the experimental glaucoma samples as well as in immuno-enriched optic nerve head astrocytes from caucasian american donors with glaucoma makes it a strong candidate as an astrocyte migratory gene in glaucoma. further, increased expression of capping protein g  was shown previously by microarray and western blot in purified human optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous donors  <cit> . there is evidence that capg is regulated by elements of the ap- <dig> transcription factor complex  <cit> , which was activated in the primate model of glaucoma  <cit> . capg has been shown to promote matrix metalloproteinase  activity  <cit> . the mmps are a family of powerful ecm degrading enzymes  <cit>  that may facilitate optic nerve head excavation in glaucoma  <cit> .

gpnmb is a  <dig> amino acid, type i transmembrane glycoprotein. in the present study, gpnmb was sharply upregulated in optic nerve head astrocytes of caucasian american donors with glaucoma. roles have been ascribed to gpnmb in the immune system  <cit> , in stress responses  <cit> , and in ecm remodeling  <cit> . the latter has been underscored by roles for gpnmb in tumor invasion  <cit> , where gpnmb promoted invasiveness through mmps and also induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor   <cit> . egfr activation is characteristic of reactive astrocytes  <cit>  and has been shown in glaucoma  <cit> .

the dba/2j mouse develops pigmentary glaucoma from the release of pigment and degenerated cellular components of the iris pigment epithelium and stroma that alter drainage structures, elevating intraocular pressure  <cit> . two distinct eye diseases produce glaucoma in the dba/2j strain â iris pigment dispersion syndrome, which was mapped to a null mutation in gpnmb, and iris stromal atrophy, which was mapped to a mutation in tyrp <dig>  <cit> . dba/2j mice with wild type gpnmb develop very mild iris disease with no retinal ganglion cell loss  <cit> . the dba/2j has immune system defects  <cit>  and immune roles for gpnmb in glaucoma must be investigated further, as gpnmb can function as a feedback regulator of macrophage activation  <cit> . the upregulation of gpnmb in the primate model and in optic nerve head astrocytes from glaucomatous human donors suggests that proper immune function of astrocytes, as nonprofessional antigen presenting cells, may require gpnmb. possible immune roles for gpnmb in optic nerve head astrocytes should be examined.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a small group of genes differentially expressed in the optic nerve head of primates with experimental hypertensive glaucoma. most have no previously characterized roles in glaucoma, yet many have previously identified roles elsewhere that suggest roles in glaucoma. our most novel finding is that in mild glaucoma, before the appearance of visual field defects, retinal ganglion cell axons may make a regenerative attempt. the upregulation of neuroprotective genes in the glaucomatous optic nerve head supports this. further investigations should determine whether neuroprotective molecules identified here can increase retinal ganglion cell survival in animal models of glaucoma.
