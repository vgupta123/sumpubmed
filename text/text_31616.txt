BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions play a key role in various aspects of the functional organization of the living cell and take place in the signal transduction of any organism. therefore, understanding ppis is very important for the investigation of biological processes such as intercellular signaling pathways and modeling protein complex structures. because of its significant status, the protein-protein interaction networks have been dawning increasing attention. most of the protein-protein interaction data was collected by experimental methods like yeast two-hybrid  screens  <cit> , tandem affinity purification   <cit> , mass spectrometric protein complex identification   <cit>  and other high-throughput biological techniques for ppis detection. a number of databases such as mint  <cit> , bind  <cit>  and dip  <cit>  have been established to store protein interaction information. however, these experimental methods are time-consuming and cost a lot. what’s worse, they can only identify a small number of interactions and fail to reach low rates of both false positive and false negative results. for these reasons, an increasing number of researchers are trying to develop a computational method for predicting ppis.

much effort has been devoted to propose computational approaches for detecting ppis based on various data types, such as genomic information, protein domain and protein structure information. for example, yu et al.  <cit>  proposed a method based on secondary structures for inferring ppis, and found that helix and disordered structures account for most of interacting regions. similarly, cai et al.  <cit>  presented a svm-based model which considers protein secondary structures, and yielded good prediction accuracy of  <dig>  % when predicting ppis of yeast dataset. however, with the exponential growth of newly discovered protein sequences, there is a widening gap between the growing rate of protein sequences and that of protein structure data. for the sake of utilizing this wealth of protein sequence data, we develop effective sequence-based computational methods for predicting ppis.

the existing computational methods for ppis prediction from amino acid sequences mainly depend on the information of protein homology or interaction marks of the protein partners. because of slow evolutionary divergence, homolog may still have the same or similar structures and functions. based on this assumption, a number of methods based on the prior biological knowledge have been proposed. zhao et al.  <cit>  proposed a model based on position specific scoring matrix and auto covariance for predicting bioluminescent proteins and yield a high test accuracy of  <dig>  %. liu et al.  <cit>  presented a protein feature extraction method considering the hydropathy profile of amino acids, and found it effectual for protein representation. however, these methods won’t work when detecting homolog with low sequence similarity. in addition, due to the similarity between the protein and its homolog decreases, it would be more difficult to use sequence homology recognition methods to solve the problem of predicting ppis. earlier studies  <cit>  indicate that knowledge of the amino acid sequence alone might be sufficient to estimate the interacting propensity between two proteins. in this context, it is of great significance to develop computational methods by only using protein sequence information for predicting protein-protein interactions.

current computational systems for predicting ppis usually consist of two parts, feature extraction and machine learning model. as the first step of computational methods, feature extraction aims to mine useful information from original samples and represent them as normalized feature vectors of the same size. effective feature extraction method usually helps the prediction system improve its performance. in this work, we adopt a method based on a global description of amino acid sequence and consider the physiochemical property of proteins in the process of feature extraction. this method would first classify  <dig> kinds of amino acids into  <dig> classes  and then gets  <dig> combinations each of which contains three different classes . based on these  <dig> combinations, a given protein sequence can be transformed into  <dig> binary characteristic sequences. each characteristic sequences would be further divided into specific numbers of subsequences according to a partition method. finally, two descriptors, composition and transition, would be extracted from these subsequences to depict the global composition of every protein sequence and form the final feature vectors.

sample classification is the second step of computational models for predicting ppis. most of current computational methods are based on the traditional classifier such as support vector machine  <cit>  and neural network  <cit> . although these classifiers have strong classification ability, they need much labor and time to adjust corresponding parameters for the best performance. recently, sparse representation based classifier  is earning reputation for its powerful classification performance in the fields of signal processing, pattern recognition and computer vision. so it would be a good trial to explore it for building prediction systems for ppis. besides, src needs few parameters to adjust. in this study, we build a computational model by employing weighted sparse representation based classifier , a variant of basic src, which integrates both sparsity and locality structure data into conventional src, and further improves the classification ability of src.

in this paper, we present a computational model for predicting ppis by combining a novel global encoding representation of proteins and weighted sparse representation based classifier. we first adjusted the corresponding parameter  of global encoding method of protein sequence and transformed every protein sequence sample into a  <dig> dimensional vector. secondly, we combined every two corresponding protein feature vectors into one representing a protein pair and then used these 300-dimensional vectors as the inputs for classifier. finally, we adopted wsrc to classify the samples. we explored our proposed method to predict ppis from three different dataset: yeast, human and h. pylori. to further estimate the performance of the proposed method, we compared it with the method based on the state-of-the-art classifier, support vector machine. in addition, in order to evaluate the generational ability of our proposed method, extensive experiments are performed to predict the ppis from six other species datasets.

RESULTS
in this section, we firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed method for predicting three different datasets: yeast, human and h. pylori by using different evaluation measures including receiver operator characteristic . we then compare the classification performances between wsrc and svm by using the same feature extraction method. in addition, we also present the results of the experiments in which we used yeast ppis samples as training set to predict ppis of other species datasets. finally, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the previous existing methods.

evaluation measures
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we use the following criteria: the overall prediction accuracy , sensitivity , precision  and matthews’s correlation coefficient  were calculated. they are defined as follows:  <dig> accuracy=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn   <dig> sensitivity=tptp+fn   <dig> pe=tptp+fp   <dig> mcc=tp×tn−fp×fntp+fn×tn+fp×tp+fp×tn+fn where true positive  denotes the number of true samples which are predicted correctly; false negative  is the number of samples predicted to be non-interacting pairs incorrectly; false positive  is the number of true non-interacting pairs predicted to be ppis falsely, and true negative  is the number of true non-interacting pairs predicted correctly. furthermore, the roc curve was also calculated to evaluate the performance of proposed method. summarizing roc curve in a numerical way, the area under an roc curve  was computed.

parameter selection
for the sake of fairness, the corresponding parameters of weighted sparse representation based classifier would be set the same when explored in three different dataset—yeast, human and h. pylori. in this paper, we set σ =  <dig>  and ε =  <dig>  when using the weighted sparse representation based classifier. as the parameter l is the unique parameter of the feature extraction method, the optimization of selection of l is of great importance for the model prediction performance. to search the best value of l, several experiments were performed by exploring yeast ppis dataset in the framework of 5-fold cross validation. the results are recorded in table  <dig> table  <dig> comparison among different l parameter values on yeast dataset



it can be observed from table  <dig> that the average accuracy gains an improvement reaching  <dig>  % when l increases from  <dig> to  <dig>  the reason is that, with a larger value of parameter l, ge descriptors can obtain more effective information. however, with the increase of the parameter l, the average prediction accuracy keeps a slight falling trend from  <dig>  down to  <dig>  %. the increase of l could also increase the complexity for computation, which may decrease the accuracy. finally, we chose l =  <dig> in our experiments.

assessment of prediction ability
in order to evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed method, we explore yeast and h. pylori dataset in this section. 5-fold cross validation is also used in our experiments in order to avoid the overfitting of the prediction model and test the performance stability. specifically, one dataset was experimented for  <dig> times and we divided the whole dataset into five subsets in each time. four of the subsets would take turns to be used for training and the rest one subset was used for testing. here, we list the prediction results of the experiments in which we used the proposed model to predict ppis of yeast and h. pylori datasets .table  <dig> 5-fold cross validation result obtained in predicting yeast ppis dataset



it can be observed that when predicting the ppis of yeast dataset, the prediction accuracies are ≥ <dig>  %, the precisions are all 100 %, and the sensitivities are ≥ <dig>  %. table  <dig> shows that when predicting the ppis of h. pylori dataset, the prediction accuracies are ≥ <dig>  %, the precisions are ≥ <dig>  %, and the sensitivities are ≥ <dig>  %. further, we can see that the standard deviations of these criteria are relative low. for the experiments on the yeast dataset, the standard deviations of accuracy, precision and sensitivity are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %. when exploring the h. pylori dataset, they come to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. to better quantify the prediction performance, matthews correlation coefficient  and the auc values of the roc curves are also calculated. the averages of mcc and auc values of experiments on yeast dataset are  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively . for the experiments on h. pylori dataset, the proposed method yielded an average mcc and auc value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> roc from proposed method result for yeast ppis dataset

the promising results show that the composition and transition descriptors in global encoding feature extraction sufficiently retain useful information from the original protein sequences. considering the high accuracies and low standard deviations, the proposed method is feasible, effective and robust.

comparison with svm-based method
there are various kinds of machine learning models having been proposed for predicting protein-protein interactions and one of the most prevalent classifiers is support vector machine . in order to evaluate the selected classification model of the proposed method, we further use support vector machine classifier to deal with an additional dataset, human ppis dataset, by using the same feature extraction method. a grid search method was used to optimize two corresponding parameters of svm c and g. here, we set c =  <dig>  g =  <dig> .

table  <dig> shows the result comparison between wsrc and svm classifier on human dataset. it can be observed that wsrc yielded good results with averages of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and mcc as high as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. however, when using the svm classifier, we obtained relatively poor results with the averages of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and mcc of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. the roc curves of the experiments are also computed and shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  it can be observed that the average auc value performed by wsrc is  <dig>  % higher than that performed by svm classifier, which is  <dig>  %. in addition, it should be noticed that the standard deviations of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and mcc yield by wsrc model are as low as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, lower that those yield by svm classifier which are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively.table  <dig> 5-fold cross validation result obtained in predicting human ppis dataset

comparison with 2-mer feature extraction method
different kinds of feature descriptors have been proposed for representing protein sequences. in this section, we further compare the performance of 2-mer feature descriptor with global encoding. 2-mer is a typical feature descriptor which records the frequencies of substrings of length  <dig>  specifically, we combine 2-mer descriptor with wsrc to predict the ppis of h. pylori dataset in the frame work of 5-fold cross validation. for fair evaluation, the parameters were set to be the same as other experiments in this work .

the comparison results are listed in table  <dig>  we can see that 2-mer feature extraction yielded relatively poor results with averages of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and mcc of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. for further evaluation, the roc curves and auc values are also computed. . the average auc value yielded by adopting 2-mer feature extraction method was  <dig>  %, lower than that yielded by the proposed model.table  <dig> experimental results yielded by combing 2-mer and wsrc on h. pylori dataset

performance on independent dataset
as the proposed model yielded good performance on the ppis data of yeast, human and h. pylori, extensive computational analyses were performed in which we explored our method on six datasets of other species. in these experiments, we used all  <dig> samples of yeast ppis dataset for training and six different ppis dataset of other species were used for testing. here, parameters σ and ε were set to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , the same as prior experiments. when predicting the ppis on datasets of d. mela, e. coli, c. elegans, h. sapien, h. pylori and m. musculus, the accuracies are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively.  predicting five of these species, we obtained promising results with average accuracies of over 83 % while e. coli dataset got a relatively low accuracy which still reaches  <dig>  %. when predicting the ppis of datasets of d. mela, c. elegans and h. sapien, the accuracy even reach ≥ <dig>  %.table  <dig> prediction results on five species based on our model

comparison with other methods
various kinds of computational methods have been proposed for predicting ppis. to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method for predicting protein interactions, we compare it with the existing methods on yeast and h. pylori datasets. table  <dig> shows the results performed by six other existing methods on yeast dataset and it can be observed that none of these methods obtains better result than that performed by the proposed method, which yielded the highest average accuracy of  <dig>  %. in addition, considering the relatively low standard deviations of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity which are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, the proposed method is more stable than the other existing methods. table  <dig> shows the results performed by other five existing methods on h. pylori dataset. the accuracies yielded by other methods are between  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, all of whom are lower than  <dig>  %, the accuracy performed by the proposed method.table  <dig> performance comparison of different methods on the yeast dataset



discussion
the feature extraction of the proposed model is mainly based on the assumption that whether two proteins interact can be greatly influenced by their physicochemical characteristics such as residues’ hydrophobic property and charged property . adopting the concept of local binary patterns , global encoding uses a binary mapping strategy and global description to retain the information of physicochemical characteristics as well as the protein sequence information . two kinds of feature descriptor, composition and transition, are proposed based on this binary mapping. composition descriptor aims to retain the distribution information and transition descriptor is used for recording the neighbour influence. to appropriately combine with global encoding which refers to the concept of lbp, we use a state-of-the-art classifier in the field of face recognition, wsrc, in the second step of model design.

it is worthwhile to highlight several aspects of the proposed approach here:  based on the results of comparison experiments, we consider the selected classification method, wsrc, superior to the svm classifier with higher accuracy and better stability. there are two possible reasons for good performance of our selected classification model. one reason lies in the fact that weighted sparse representation based classifier integrates both sparsity and locality structure data into conventional src, which help improve the prediction performance dealing with the global encoding descriptor. the similarity of global encoding to lbp descriptor may explain the superiority of wsrc, and vapnik-chervonenkis dimension of wsrc which is larger than svm may lead to a fit with the global encoding descriptor. in addition, wsrc needs little manual intervention to adjust its corresponding parameters, which help us obtain good results without much effort.  interestingly, the outstanding results of table  <dig> show that yeast ppis data is possibly sufficient for predicting ppis of other species and that our proposed method is has a strong generational ability and powerful to deal with cross-species ppis prediction.  it is known that ensemble classifier usually achieves more accurate and robust performance than the methods using single classifier. however, when predicting ppis of yeast and h. pylori dataset, our proposed model even yields a better result than some of existing method which are based on ensemble classifier such as boosting and ensemble of hknn. from these comparisons, we consider the wsrc-based model combined with global encoding feature extraction method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.  global encoding retains the information of physicochemical characters and 2-mer descriptor doesn’t. therefore, global encoding is expected to be superior to 2-mer for predicting ppis and the results of comparison experiment conform to this anticipation. the results illustrate that physicochemical characters can help improve the performance for predicting ppis.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to obtain more knowledge on protein-protein interactions, developing effective computational methods for ppis prediction become increasing important. in this work, we explore a novel prediction model for ppis by combing weighted sparse representation based classifier and global encoding representation of proteins. in the process of feature extraction, two kinds of descriptors, composition and transition, are extracted from subsequences of global encoding. weighted sparse representation based classifier would be finally used to deal with sample classification. the proposed method performs well when predicting on no matter one species data or cross-species data. good results imply that our proposed method is feasible, superior and robust.
