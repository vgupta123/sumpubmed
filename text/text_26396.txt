BACKGROUND
paratuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous enteritis caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  and affects domestic and wild ruminants worldwide, causing considerable economic losses for the livestock industry  <cit> . research to improve diagnostic methods and prophylactic measures has been performed for many years, but still many questions remain unanswered. one reason is the extended clinically non-apparent initial phase of the infection and the still insufficient knowledge about the interactions between the host organism and the pathogen during this time period.

despite large numbers of naturally map infected animals, elucidation of host-pathogen interactions in the early phase of the disease is only possible using the defined conditions and variables of experimental animal models. this is due to a diagnostic gap that allows in vivo identification of infected animals only after sero-conversion or after the onset of faecal shedding, which become detectable late in the course of the disease with large inter-individual variation  <cit> . experimental animal infection models allow the investigation of relevant numbers of animals with defined infection status and under identical conditions during the clinically non-apparent phase of disease.

experimental infections have been performed in diverse domestic species, and furthermore, in small laboratory animals  <cit> . study conditions were not standardized among the experiments making comparisons difficult. generally, age at infection, dose and frequency of inoculation, and duration of the experiment are decisive for disease development  <cit> . international guidelines for standardization of animal models for paratuberculosis have been proposed only recently  <cit> . while cattle, sheep and deer have been used extensively studies in goats are rare and only small numbers of animals were included  <cit> . since marked individual variations of host immune response and lesions were observed even in the same experiment, the conclusions vary widely.

performing experimental infections in goats has several advantages in comparison to cattle and sheep. goats are susceptible to the three main groups of map, type i, ii and iii  <cit> . they are considered the least naturally map resistant species due to a rather fast disease progress  <cit> . this allows a shorter duration of experiments. in a study using angora goats, specific ifn-γ responses were observed already one month after challenge with map positive gut mucosa and sero-conversion as early as four months post infection . clinical signs occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> mpi  <cit> . in addition, the feeding and housing requirements of goats are easier to fulfil compared to cattle.

the aim of the present study was to establish a well characterized experimental animal model for the clinically non-apparent phase of paratuberculosis in goats as a basis for future studies of the early pathogenesis of map infection.

RESULTS
clinical signs
severe clinical signs of paratuberculosis were observed in three of the map-inoculated animals . one animal each of group v <dig> and v <dig> developed non-treatable diarrhea at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, respectively, and had to be necropsied, while the third goat of group v <dig> was cachectic at  <dig> wpi. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> wpi,  <dig> other goats of group v <dig> died or had to be euthanized because of neurologic signs. post mortem examination revealed cerebrocortical necrosis.

shedding of map
map was detected repeatedly in the faeces of most of the animals during the inoculation period . shedding stopped at  <dig> wpi in  <dig> of the  <dig> early inoculated goats and in eight of the  <dig> late inoculated goats and re-emerged about  <dig> wpi in all animals except one goat of group v <dig>  a large inter-individual variability of shedding in terms of intensity  and time course was observed independent from inoculation time and dose. essentially, three different shedding patterns occurred: animals that stopped shedding before  <dig> wpi , animals that shed map intermittently until necropsy  and animals that shed map continuously during the entire course of the experiment . animals which had to be necropsied before the end of the observation period were not defined .table  <dig>

antibody response
the specific antibody response against map started at  <dig> wpi in the map-inoculated animals. the proportion of antibody positive animals as well as antibody levels increased until 22– <dig> wpi. s/p% varied largely between individuals with no significant differences between inoculation groups in general . no seroconversion was observed in three map-inoculated goats from different groups  and in all control animals.figure  <dig>

ifn-γ response
a specific ifn-γ response of the map-inoculated animals against jppd was first detected at 10– <dig> wpi. ifn-γ release of the pbmc reached peak values at 22– <dig> wpi and decreased afterwards. at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, the ifn-γ response of group v <dig>  exceeded that of the other inoculated groups. because of the large variation of the response within the groups, statistically significant differences between inoculation groups occurred only incidentally. in the control groups no jppd-specific ifn-γ release was induced .

il- <dig> response
a marked release of il- <dig> was induced by in vitro stimulation of pbmc from map-inoculated and control animals with jppd at 6– <dig> wpi  or 6– <dig> wpi . time course and magnitude of the response differed between early and late inoculated groups including the respective controls with peak responses at  <dig> wpi in group k <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> and at  <dig> wpi in groups k <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig>  the control groups tended to have a lower il- <dig> response than the two age matched map-inoculated groups. this was more pronounced in the younger animals . at later sampling dates the il- <dig> response of all groups decreased considerably .figure  <dig>

on the individual animal level, no marked differences in the bob of intestinal lymph nodes, ogalt and intestinal mucosa could be detected in animals with bob category iii, while variability was higher in category ii animals. culturally negative and the two categories of culturally positive animals were distributed over all inoculation groups.

gross pathology
macroscopic lesions were most frequently  seen in mesenteric and ileocolic lymph nodes and ogalt, especially jpps. affected lymph nodes were enlarged and had areas of necrosis and calcification varying from 1 mm to extensive throughout the entire lymph node . jpps had reduced thickness and were indented in most of the goats , in a few goats they were thickened and firm . the surface was occasionally ulcerated. chronic villous serositis was regularly seen at the serosal aspect of altered jpps . lesions were inconsistently seen in the ipp, icvpp and pcpp. both intestinal lymph nodes as well as ogalt were altered in most goats. intestinal wall outside ogalt was affected less frequently . multiple small  foci of thickened intestinal mucosa were seen in the small intestine of seven, thickening of segments in three and of the entire length in another three goats. the latter was associated with corrugated intestinal mucosa. thickened and nodular lymphatics were frequent in the altered segments of intestine. intestinal lesions were restricted to the small intestine and were seen only in goats which had also lesions in jpps and intestinal lymph nodes. all goats from the control groups and one goat of groups v <dig> and v <dig> each were without paratuberculous lesions. a few helminths were seen in a few goats of all groups.figure  <dig>

histopathology and immunohistochemistry for map
histopathology confirmed the macroscopic lesions in intestinal lymph nodes . granulomas with extensive central necrosis and calcification surrounded by a variable amount of granulomatous infiltrate, fibrocytes and lymphocytes predominated . small amounts of mycobacterial material  were regularly seen by ihc in the necrotic centers . multibacillary lesions were seen in four of the early inoculated goats . multifocal granulomatous infiltrates of epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells  were seen in subcapsular sinuses, along trabeculae and adjacent to granulomas in  <dig> goats additionally to granulomas and in  <dig> goats as only lesions. single mycobacteria were detected occasionally in these infiltrates.

to allow better comparison with immunologic and bacterial culture data, lesions in intestinal lymph nodes were scored as no lesions , mild lesions  or severe lesions . animals with category iii lesions predominated. goats with mild lesions were particularly frequent in v <dig>  one goat of v <dig> and three of v <dig> had no lesions in intestinal lymph nodes .

macroscopic lesions in jpps were confirmed in all affected goats by histology. in the majority of goats , the architecture of the organized lymphoid tissue was markedly altered with few and small lymphoid follicles and severe and sometimes complete loss of interfollicular lymphoid tissue . lesions were characterized by small focal to multifocal groups of epitheloid cells and few mgcs and extensive infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells . the mucosal surface was irregular with occasional ulcers. a mild to severe chronic fibro-proliferative serositis was seen regularly. lesions were paucibacillary in one goat, multibacillary in one goat and without mycobacteria by ihc in  <dig> goats . in three goats, small granulomatous infiltrates without changes of the tissue architecture were seen in addition . two goats from the early inoculated groups had more extensive infiltrates of epitheloid cells and mgcs admixed with lymphocytes predominantly in the interfollicular areas . mycobacteria were not detected in type a and b lesions by ihc. multifocal, moderate to severe infiltrates of predominantly epitheloid cells  occurred in one goat of group v <dig> and one goat of group v <dig> . numerous mycobacteria were present in the epitheloid cells of these lesions . comparable lesions were detected in other sites with ogalt, e.g. ipp, icvpp, pcpp and in the rectum, but less frequently.figure  <dig>

lesions in the intestine outside ogalt were characterized by multifocal infiltrates of epitheloid cells and few mgcs. mgcs predominated in small and focal lesions which were often missed by the macroscopic examination. mycobacteria were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> goats with intestinal lesions.

lesions in ogalt and small intestine were also classified as lesions category i to iii. besides the extent of lesions and number of mycobacteria detected by ihc, the number of ogalt  and intestinal sites  collected for histology with lesions was included. a mix of goats with all lesions categories were seen in all groups. goats with lesions category ii in ogalt and without lesions  in small intestine were more frequent in group v <dig> 

association between lesion category and bob category
a clear association between lesion and bob category was noted in ogalt and small intestinal tissue . no to mild lesions predominated in those tissues where no bacterial growth had been detected. tissues with bacterial organ burden were characterized by mild to severe lesions, the strongest association between severe lesions and high bob was noted in the ogalt. in contrast, no association between lesion and bob category could be established in the intestinal lymph nodes. severe lesions predominated in lnn with low and even without bob .table  <dig>

discussion
a well characterized experimental model for the clinically non-apparent phase of paratuberculosis was established which fulfils the following requirements for the experimental design  <cit> :  defined host,  standardized infection,  standardized stage of disease,  appropriate controls.

goats of the breed thüringer wald ziege were selected as host species. this is an independent native german breed of dairy goats which has been maintained without cross-breeding since  <dig>  <cit> . all kids came from one pedigree herd with no history of clinical paratuberculosis. freedom from disease had been verified by the negative outcome of faecal culture of all adult goats prior to purchase of the kids and was confirmed by lack of lesions as well as negative results of faecal and tissue culture of all control animals.

for standardization of the infection special attention was paid to the strain selection and preparation of the inoculum. the isolate used for inoculation  is a type ii  strain of map genetically highly similar to k <dig> . it was isolated from the icv-ln of a dairy cow with paratuberculosis  <cit> . the inoculum was prepared from a bacterial stock which had been established after a few passages of the isolate. aliquots of this stock are available for further experiments. the map dose was standardized as recommended  <cit>  by adjusting the bacterial wet mass used for preparation of the inoculum.

four different inoculation regimens were compared in order to optimize the model to be representative for the clinically non-apparent phase of the disease. three animals of the group inoculated with the high dose at early age developed neurological signs which could not be attributed to map infection. an association between cerebrocortical necrosis and paratuberculosis has not been reported in the literature.

in addition to clinical signs, the course of the disease was monitored in vivo by four parameters , which have also been used by other investigators , thus allowing comparison between studies. the blood parameters in particular were seen as surrogates of host-pathogen interactions in clinically healthy animals.

the experiment was terminated about one year after inoculation independent of the appearance of clinical signs. at that time, the proportion of animals that developed clinical signs characteristic of paratuberculosis was rather low and independent from group allocation. tissue lesions and level of tissue colonization with map were quantified as measure for the manifestation and dissemination of the infection. the results confirmed that the majority of the inoculated goats were in the clinically non-apparent phase of paratuberculosis. the results of the in vivo parameters indicate that even the animal without signs of infection at necropsy  had undergone transient infection.

appropriate numbers of age-matched control animals of the same origin were included in the study and examined in the same manner as the inoculated goats. the animals were kept in a separate room of the same animal facility as the inoculated groups to assure similar environmental, feeding and housing conditions. they were neither exposed to nor infected by map as proven by the results of the examinations conducted in vivo and after necropsy. this confirms that the applied sanitary and management measures were sufficient to prevent unwanted carry-over of map.

onset and time course of faecal shedding, antibody response, and antigen-specific ifn-γ response was similar to one  <cit>  and completely different from another study in goats  <cit> , further supporting the need for standardization of the model. in both studies the total inoculation doses were considerably higher than in the present one, and the goats were challenged with a map strain of caprine origin whereas our goats received an isolate of bovine origin. differences in virulence or host adaptation of the map strains used for inoculation have to be taken into account. however, direct comparison of the virulence of bovine and caprine map isolates for goats has not been performed yet. higher responsiveness and/or a quicker onset of the host response to c-strains of map in comparison to s-strains has been demonstrated in sheep, goats, cattle  <cit>  and deer  <cit> . another explanation might be a different susceptibility of different goat breeds to map although scientific evidence is lacking  <cit> .

in the present experiment, ifn-γ response and antibody response started almost at the same time. this matches with findings in naturally infected goats where the onset of the ifn-γ response usually preceded the humoral response, but positive antibody titers could sometimes be seen simultaneously with, or even prior to the ifn-γ response  <cit> . the paradigm of a th <dig> over th <dig> dominancy in the early stages of map infection, that has been postulated for many years, is challenged by these data, which are further confirmed by the results of experimental map infections of sheep  <cit> . considerable variation of the individual host responses was seen in the further course of the experiment which is in agreement with findings in naturally infected goats  <cit>  as well as experimentally infected sheep  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> .

transient elevation of antigen-induced il- <dig> release by pbmc was observed in map-inoculated and control goats up to  <dig> wpi depending on the age at inoculation, with significantly higher levels in map-inoculated animals compared to age–matched controls  in the early inoculated groups . similar findings were reported from calves after experimental oral inoculation of mucosal scrapings from a cow with clinical paratuberculosis  <cit> . it can be speculated that a transient anti-inflammatory response is induced in very young goats shortly after map infection which is subsequently down-regulated by a strong ifn-γ response indicative of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. in a leprosy model, ifn-γ differentially modulated il- <dig> and il- <dig> production resulting in up-regulation of il- <dig> and down-regulation of il- <dig> release in response to mycobacterium leprae stimulation  <cit> .

morphological investigation and cultivation of map from tissues collected at necropsy one year after inoculation were used to confirm the infection. lesions and/or map were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> goats inoculated indicating a very high infection rate. this has been reported in several other studies in goats and confirms the good reproducibility of map-infection using this model  <cit> . lesions induced by the experimental infection were comparable to those in natural infection  <cit> . there were minor differences:  naturally infected goats had a higher frequency of diffuse lesions in the small intestine indicating a more advanced stage of infection in the goats sampled at slaughter  <cit> .  jpp and icvpp were most consistently affected in the present and other experimental studies  <cit> , whereas lesions predominated in ipp, terminal ileum and icvpp in naturally infected goats and also some experimental studies  <cit> . lesions were seen in intestinal lymph nodes in similar frequency as in ogalt, whereas other studies report a predominance of lesions in intestinal lymph nodes  <cit> . these differences might be related to the sampling procedures.  the number of intestinal lymph nodes with caseous and calcified granulomas was markedly higher compared to naturally infected goats  <cit> . it remains unresolved whether virulence of the map strain, stage of infection or susceptibility of the breed have contributed to this. caseous and calcified granulomas are characteristic of map infection in goats and not common in other ruminant species. they may allow comparative studies for other mycobacterial infections even beyond the scope of paratuberculosis.

isolation of map from tissues was not possible in four of the inoculated goats, confirming findings in other experimental studies  <cit> . obviously, the organism was cleared to a large extent or changed to a viable-but-non-culturable state after manifestation of infection, since all four goats shed map until at least  <dig> wpi, all mounted a specific ifn-γ response, and tissue lesions were found in three of them. culture results were assessed semi-quantitatively, an approach utilized only in a few other published studies in goats and sheep  <cit> . this allowed allocation of the animals to bob categories as a prerequisite for additional comparative analyses. in agreement with another experimental study  <cit>  viable map was most often recovered from lymph nodes and to a lesser extent from intestinal mucosa and ogalt. in contrast, no difference in the proportion of positive lymph nodes and intestinal samples was obvious in naturally infected adult goats  <cit> . this seems to be due to the more advanced stage of the disease in these animals in comparison to the experimental studies. viable map was also recovered from extra-intestinal sites, pointing to dissemination of the organisms already in the clinically non-apparent phase of the disease and confirming findings in experimentally  <cit>  and naturally infected goats  <cit> .

two different doses of map and two different age periods for inoculation were compared in order to identify the optimal infection regimen. there was considerable inter-individual variation in faecal shedding, the in vivo-host responses, bob and lesions at necropsy, but no significant differences between the treatment groups except for an earlier onset of the ifn-γ response and a reduced il- <dig> response in the animals that received high map doses starting at 42 days after birth . this is not unexpected, since the modifications of the inoculation dose and the age at inoculation were only minimal in the present experiment in comparison to other studies performed in sheep and deer  <cit> .

the readout parameters, lesion scores and bob, used at the end of the experiment were closely matching in the intestinal tract, but markedly different in the intestinal ln. differences between lesion scores and bob were more frequent in goats with milder lesions where ogalt and intestinal mucosa were not uniformly affected. in the intestinal ln, histological classification did not allow conclusions about bob. in particular, low bob was associated with no, mild and severe lesions. these differences are not unexpected, since the lesions reflect tissue damage caused by map and the reaction of the host to map, and cultural results the ability of map to survive, replicate and spread. it can be speculated that map is more efficiently cleared from intestinal ln than from mucosa or ogalt because of tissue-specific control mechanisms. the granulomas that predominated in the intestinal ln may either allow the host to control the mycobacterial infection or map to persist  <cit> .

overall lesion and bob categories showed agreement in the majority of goats. only in three goats, map was not cultivated, but caseous and calcifying granulomas were present in intestinal lymph nodes and in three goats, lesions were considered severe, but bob was low. two factors might have contributed to these discrepancies:  the massive host immune response – seen as severe lesions - may have reduced the amount of viable map in the tissue and  organization and removal of lesions after the clearance of the pathogen take an extended period of time. lesions and bob categories will allow subgrouping of animals for retrospective analyses of in vivo data.

CONCLUSIONS
a well characterized experimental animal model of paratuberculosis was established in goats. the lack of clinical signs and the finding of paucibacillary lesions in the majority of goats indicate that this experimental model targets as intended the clinically non-apparent phase of infection. monitoring of host-pathogen interaction in vivo and post mortem findings confirmed inter-individual differences in the progress of disease and will allow subgrouping for comparative investigations. this animal model provides the basis for future studies of pathogenesis and early diagnosis of map infection.
