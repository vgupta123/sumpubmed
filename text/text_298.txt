BACKGROUND
the complement system is a large protein network in plasma that forms the primary host defense barrier against microbial infections  <cit> . complement can rapidly label bacterial cells for phagocytosis and generate chemoattractants to recruit immune cells to the site of infection  <cit> . furthermore, complement directly kills bacteria via a pore-forming membrane attack complex  <cit> . although complement is crucial for local clearance of bacteria at the site of infection, complement activation products  can cause an overwhelming inflammatory response during systemic infections  <cit> . furthermore, there is a large list of inflammatory disorders in which erroneous activation of complement on the body’s own cells causes aberrant inflammatory reactions and pathology  <cit> .

complement proteins circulate in the blood as inactive precursors, but are immediately activated upon contact with target cells. recognition of target cells occurs via different large molecules  that bind to microbial surface structures and trigger a step-wise activation process in which protein binding and cleavage events occur in a well-defined order  <cit> . all initiation pathways converge in the formation of short-lived c <dig> convertase enzymes on the target surface. these c <dig> convertases cleave the major complement protein c <dig> into the large, reactive c3b molecule that can covalently attach to target surfaces to label them for rapid opsonization and phagocytosis  <cit> . in the alternative pathway , the c <dig> convertase consists of two protein subunits: the non-catalytic protein c3b in complex with protease bb    <cit> . structural studies suggested that the c3b unit of the c <dig> convertase forms a dimer with its substrate c <dig>  <cit> . since bb is bound to a flexible domain in c3b it can swing towards the substrate and cleave the scissile bond in c <dig>  the cleavage results in the release of c3a and, due to large structural rearrangements, the reactive thioester of newly formed c3b becomes exposed and provokes covalent attachment of c3b to any hydroxyl or amine group on the target surface  <cit> . during the massive labelling of surfaces with c3b, association of one or more c3b molecules to the existing c <dig> convertase changes the substrate specificity of the enzyme that will then cleave c <dig>  <cit> . the exact molecular mechanism for this ‘convertase switch’ is poorly understood. previous studies have indicated that c3b molecules can adopt a surface-specific conformation  <cit> , but the exact difference between c3b molecules in solution versus a surface remains unknown. for instance the exact stoichiometry and molecular arrangement of c3b molecules on the surface remains unclear. detailed molecular analyses are largely complicated by the covalent linkage of c3b molecules to the target surface and the requirement of c <dig> convertases to generate high c3b densities  <cit> . in this study we present a novel, purified functional assay model for c <dig> convertases in which we mimic the natural orientation and density of c3b molecules on bead surfaces. using functional c <dig> conversion analyses, we provide molecular insights into the surface-specific conformation of c3b molecules. furthermore, molecular studies highlight two important interfaces for the recognition of substrate c <dig> by surface-bound convertase enzymes. these increased molecular insights into c <dig> convertase enzymes are essential to understand the molecular basis for deregulated and excessive convertase activity in human disease and will be critical for future design of therapeutic interventions against the undesired activation of complement during systemic infections and acute inflammatory processes.fig.  <dig> a novel bead-based assay model for purified alternative pathway  c <dig> convertases. a proposed model for assembly of c <dig> convertases in the ap. surface-bound c <dig> convertase  cleaves multiple c <dig> molecules into c3b that covalently binds to target surfaces via the reactive thioester . association of deposited c3b molecules with the existing c <dig> convertase gives rise to multimeric complexes  that, together with bb, can convert c <dig>  the precise arrangement of surface-specific c <dig> convertases is currently unknown. in the novel c <dig> convertase assay model described in this study, c3b molecules are site-specifically biotinylated via the thioester and loaded on bacteria-sized streptavidin beads  to mimic their natural density and orientation on target surfaces. b loading of streptavidin beads with biotinylated c3b was analyzed by flow cytometry or immunoblotting . c c <dig> convertase activity of c3b-coated beads that were incubated with factor b , factor d   and c <dig>  conversion of c <dig> was determined by measuring release of c5a in the supernatant using a calcium mobilization assay with u937-c5ar cells. values represent absolute c5a flux . d c <dig> convertase activity of c3b molecules on beads versus c3b molecules in solution. the amount of c3b molecules in solution was adjusted to the levels of c3b loaded onto the beads  and both were incubated with fb, fd and c <dig>  b–d data of three independent experiments, presented as means ± standard deviation . immunoblot is a representative of three independent experiments



RESULTS
a novel assay model to analyze purified ap c <dig> convertases
in order to mimic physiological surface-bound c3b, we labelled purified c3b with biotin via the thioester by activating plasma-purified c <dig> into c3b in the presence of a biotinylation agent that reacts with the cysteine residue of the c3b thioester  . these biotinylated c3b molecules were subsequently loaded onto small magnetic streptavidin beads that have a diameter of  <dig>  μm  and a theoretical binding capacity of around  <dig>  c3b molecules per particle . we first established that c3b-biotin molecules could bind to streptavidin beads in a dose-dependent manner . to assay c <dig> convertase activity, c3b-loaded beads were incubated with purified factor b , factor d  and c <dig> after which c <dig> conversion was quantified by analyzing c5a release into the supernatant using a calcium mobilization assay with c5a receptor  transfected cells  <cit> . we observed effective conversion of c <dig> in the presence of fb and fd, which are both needed to form protease fragment bb, which was dependent on the concentration of c3b on the beads. as a control, we showed that c3b beads incubated with c <dig> alone, c5 + fb, or c5 + fd, did not convert c <dig> . next, we compared c <dig> convertase activity of surface-bound convertases  with monomeric c <dig> convertases in fluid-phase  that are known for their low-level and inefficient conversion of c <dig>  <cit> . at equal amounts of c3b, c <dig> conversion was over 100-fold more efficient on the beads than in solution  . these data strongly suggest that surface-bound c3b molecules can adopt a unique conformation or arrangement to cleave c <dig> that does not exist in fluid-phase. importantly, this reconstituted model is the first system that mimics this critical orientation and density of c3b molecules on a surface using highly purified components and non-covalent surface attachment and is therefore ideal to assess c <dig> convertase biology.

c <dig> binds to c3b-coated beads
according to the literature, an increased density of c3b molecules on serum-opsonized particles creates high-affinity binding sites for c <dig>  <cit> . to analyze whether c <dig> could stably bind to c3b-coated beads, we loaded streptavidin beads with different concentrations of biotinylated c3b and analyzed the binding of c <dig> by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. to prevent proteolytic cleavage of c <dig> by bb, we performed these binding studies in the absence of fb and fd. c <dig> could specifically bind to c3b on the beads, while no binding was observed on empty beads . flow cytometry studies indicated that the binding of c <dig> to surface-bound c3b increases at higher concentrations of c3b on beads . using size-exclusion chromatography, we found that this interaction was exclusive for surface-bound c3b since c <dig> did not detectably bind biotinylated c3b in solution . these binding studies show that attachment of c3b molecules to a surface alters the binding affinity of c <dig> for c3b.fig.  <dig> c <dig> binds to c3b-coated beads. c3b-coated streptavidin beads were incubated with c <dig> . binding of c <dig> to c3b beads was determined by a western blotting or b flow cytometry. a is a representative gel of three independent experiments; b shows data of three independent experiments, presented as means ± standard deviation 



attachment of c3b with the thioester toward the surface is critical for c <dig> convertase activity
previous studies have suggested that the deposition of c3b molecules by the c <dig> convertase is important for generation of efficient c <dig> convertases. it was proposed that covalent c3b multimers, generated when a newly formed c3b molecule reacts with an existing c <dig> convertase via the thioester, might be important for c <dig> convertase activity  <cit> . in order to investigate this, we generated ‘self-amplified’ c3b beads on which the majority of c3b molecules are deposited via c <dig> convertases. to this end we first coated beads with low concentrations of c3b-biotin and subsequently performed repeating incubations of the beads with fb, fd and c <dig> . after five rounds of self-amplification, we obtained beads of which 70–90 % of c3b molecules were deposited by a c <dig> convertase . using western blotting, we confirmed generation of covalently attached c3b multimers   <cit> . next, we compared the c <dig> conversion by ‘self-amplified c3b’ with ‘biotinylated c3b’ beads that contained equal amounts of c3b, either loaded via the biotin-streptavidin interaction or by c <dig> conversion. we found no difference in c <dig> conversion efficiency between beads loaded with self-amplified c3b versus biotinylated c3b . also when self-amplification was performed in human serum, we found no difference in c <dig> conversion efficiency between serum-derived c3b and biotinylated c3b . next, we analyzed whether the orientation of c3b molecules with the thioester orientated toward the surface is important for surface-dependent c <dig> conversion. therefore we compared the c <dig> conversion rates of ‘biotinylated c3b’ beads with ‘randomly coupled c3b’ beads . for random attachment of c3b to a bead, we used tosyl-activated beads  that randomly bind molecules via primary amino or sulfhydryl groups. for a valid comparison with ‘biotinylated c3b’ beads we here used tosyl streptavidin beads to bind biotinylated c3b. c3b quantification was performed using flow cytometry . both beads were analyzed for their capacity to cleave c <dig>  interestingly, the beads on which c3b was bound in a random orientation completely lacked c <dig> convertase activity , indicating that the orientation of c3b molecules with the thioester group toward the surface is indeed essential for c <dig> convertase functioning. altogether these data show that c3b molecules need to bind to the surface in their natural orientation and, in contrast to what was previously postulated, we show that covalent attachment of c3b molecules on top of each other is not required.fig.  <dig> attachment of c3b with the thioester toward the surface is critical for c <dig> convertase activity. a left, streptavidin beads with site-specifically biotinylated c3b molecules. right, self-amplified c3b beads were generated by coating streptavidin beads with a low concentration of c3b-biotin after which fb, fd and c <dig> were added for five repeating incubations to allow natural deposition of c3b and formation of covalently associated c3b multimers . b c <dig> convertase activity on self-amplified and biotinylated c3b beads. beads  were incubated with fb, fd and c <dig> and c5a release was determined by calcium mobilization. c random c3b beads were generated by coupling c3b-biotin onto tosyl-activated beads. d c <dig> convertase activity on random and biotinylated c3b beads.  data of three independent experiments, presented as means ± standard deviation 



high surface density of c3b is critical for c <dig> convertase activity
next, we wondered whether the unique surface-specific conformation of c3b molecules could be explained by the fact that a surface allows c3b molecules to come together at a high density. such a high density may allow for certain intermolecular interactions between c3b molecules that do not occur at a lower density. so far, it has not been possible to functionally compare c3b molecules at different surface densities. using the streptavidin bead model described here, we could now generate beads with different c3b densities in a well-controlled manner. similar to the c3b dose–response experiment in fig. 1b, we incubated  <dig> ×  <dig> beads with  <dig>  μg or  <dig>  μg of c3b-biotin. this results in loading of beads with c3b at concentrations below saturation . then, we lowered c3b densities by increasing the number of beads  while keeping the amounts of c3b per sample constant . flow cytometric quantification indicated that we successfully reduced the c3b levels per bead in a step-wise manner . using immunoblotting we showed that the total c3b levels in the sample  was equal . then we compared the c <dig> convertase activity on these beads and found that c <dig> conversion rates significantly decrease with lower c3b densities . plotting the c5a levels against the absolute numbers of c3b molecules per μm <dig>  suggests the requirement of a critical surface density of c3b to trigger effective c <dig> conversion. in our model, this critical density is reached at concentrations of  <dig>  c3b molecules per μm <dig> . altogether these studies suggest that the density of c3b molecules on a surface is a critical determinant for generating effective c <dig> convertases.fig.  <dig> high surface density of c3b is critical for c <dig> convertase activity. a preparation of beads with different densities of c3b. b mixing a fixed amount of c3b molecules with increasing numbers of streptavidin beads results in lower c3b densities per bead  while total levels of c3b per sample are equal . c c <dig> convertase activity on streptavidin beads with different c3b densities. d c <dig> convertase activity plotted against the absolute number of c3b molecules per μm <dig> . b–d data of three independent experiments, presented as means ± standard deviation . immunoblot graphs are representative of three independent experiments. measures of statistical significance were determined by one-way anova for the different amounts of beads versus  <dig> ×  <dig> beads and displayed as: ns; *p < <dig> ; **p < <dig> ; ***p < <dig> ; and ****p < <dig> 



inhibitors reveal two important interaction sites for c <dig> with surface-bound c3b
although the molecular organization of ap c <dig> convertases is largely unknown, the three-dimensional structure of the alternative pathway c <dig> convertase  in complex with the staphylococcal complement inhibitor  has been determined  <cit> . this structure suggested that the c3b unit of the c <dig> convertase forms a head-to-head dimer with its substrate c <dig> and subsequently allows bb, bound to a flexible domain in c3b, to swing towards the c <dig> substrate and cleave the scissile bond   <cit> . due to the high structural similarity between c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , a similar substrate-convertase model was proposed for c <dig> convertases  <cit> . also, the crystal structure of the c3b homologue cobra venom factor  bound to c <dig> indicated that the interface between cvf and c <dig> is highly similar to the c3b-c <dig> interface in the c <dig> convertase structure   <cit> . to study this hypothesis, we first generated a hypothetical model of c3bbb-c <dig>  by overlaying the structures of c3bbb  <cit>  with cvf-c <dig>   <cit> . then, we performed inhibitor analyses in our functional c <dig> convertase model to investigate the physiological relevance of this proposed c5-c3b interaction. to this end we used eculizumab , a humanized antibody against c <dig>  <cit> , that binds to an epitope within the mg <dig> domain  <cit>  and would cause steric hindrance of c <dig> binding to c3b in the proposed model . indeed, we observe that eculizumab potently interferes with c <dig> conversion, both by surface-bound c3b on beads and soluble cvfbb . then, we studied the bacterial protein ssl <dig> that potently binds c <dig> and prevents c <dig> conversion on biological surfaces   <cit> . the ssl7-c5-cvf structure revealed that ssl <dig> binds c <dig> in a region that would not sterically hinder formation of the proposed c3b-c <dig> interface . interestingly, we observed that ssl <dig> inhibited c <dig> conversion by c3b-coated beads while a mutant of ssl <dig> defective of c <dig> binding  could not . in concordance with the finding that ssl <dig> can still bind to cvf-c <dig>  we found that ssl <dig> could not block c <dig> conversion by cvfbb . combining the results for eculizumab and ssl <dig> indicates that the interaction sites of both inhibitors are important for the interaction of c <dig> with surface-bound c3b. to further confirm, we analyzed whether eculizumab and ssl <dig> could block the binding of c <dig> to surface-bound c3b. indeed, we found that both inhibitors could prevent binding of c <dig> to c3b beads . also, when we analyzed binding of c <dig> to serum-opsonized bacteria  we observed that both inhibitors disturb binding of c <dig> to c3b . altogether these findings indicate that the interaction of c <dig> with surface-bound c3b occurs at multiple interfaces, including the proposed c <dig> interaction site similar to the reported cvf-c <dig> interface  and the ssl7-binding site in c <dig> .fig.  <dig> inhibitors reveal two important interaction sites for c <dig> with surface-bound c3b. a left, schematic representation of the proposed interaction between substrate c <dig> and the alternative pathway  c <dig> convertase . right, binding of c <dig> to cvfbb . cvf is a potent c3b homologue that lacks the thioester domain and forms stable c <dig> convertases in solution. b structural model of the previously proposed ap c <dig> convertase. the c3/c <dig> convertase  is shown in ribbon representation, with c3b in gray and bb in orange, respectively. c <dig>  is shown as a molecular surface, with residue involved in eculizumab  and ssl <dig>  binding colored on the surface. the left and right representations represent the same complex rotated 180° about the vertical axis. c c <dig> conversion on c3b-coated beads in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml c <dig> inhibitors  as determined by calcium mobilization of u937-c5ar cells. d c <dig> conversion by soluble cvfbb in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml c <dig> inhibitors. e c <dig> binding to c3b-coated beads  in absence or presence of 20 μg/ml c <dig> inhibitors, determined by flow cytometry. f c <dig> binding to pre-opsonized bacteria in absence or presence of 20 μg/ml c <dig> inhibitors . c–f data of three independent experiments, presented as means ± standard deviation . measures of statistical significance were determined by one-way anova for the various inhibitors versus buffer control alone and displayed as: ns; *p < <dig> ; **p < <dig> ; ***p < <dig> ; and ****p < <dig> 



discussion
a long-standing question in complement biology is how a convertase enzyme can switch between its two substrates, c <dig> and c <dig>  while the molecular mechanisms underlying c <dig> conversion are well understood, research on the c <dig> convertases has been hampered by their ‘surface-specific’ configuration. although most convertase research has been performed in highly complex protein environments like human plasma, studies performed in semi-purified conditions have significantly improved our understanding of c <dig> convertases  <cit> . there it was shown that c <dig> convertases are specifically formed on target surfaces after a c <dig> convertase enzyme deposits one or more c3b molecules. both the conversion efficiency and c <dig> binding affinity increased when high densities of c3b were present on a biological surface  <cit> . however, since c <dig> convertase-dependent c3b deposition was the only method to generate such high densities on a surface, it remained unclear how c3b molecules were arranged and oriented within the c <dig> convertase. using the highly purified assay system developed in this study, we here provide detailed insights into the surface-specific molecular arrangement of c <dig> convertases.

different theories have been proposed for why c3b molecules on a surface are more effective in forming a c <dig> convertase. for instance, it was suggested that unique covalent c3b multimers are formed when a newly formed c3b molecule reacts with the c3b molecule of the pre-existing convertase via its released thioester  <cit> . in our system, we found no evidence for the role of such covalent c3b multimers in c <dig> conversion. our findings strongly indicate that surfaces enable the site-specific attachment and high density of c3b molecules that are critical for formation of c <dig> convertases in the alternative pathway. on our streptavidin beads, we find that c3b concentrations of  <dig>  molecules/μm <dig> and higher are needed for effective c <dig> convertase activity . likely, c3b molecules need to come close to each other to allow c <dig> binding. to get an idea of the intermolecular distance of c3b molecules on a surface we attempted to model c3b surface density at a molecular level. based on the known dimensions of a c3b molecule    <cit> , we placed different numbers of c3b molecules in a hypothetical  <dig> × 150 nm area representing a portion of the bead surface. the crystallographic structure of c3b was oriented such that the long axis was perpendicular to the surface and the thioester  was in contact with the surface . for the analyzed c3b densities , the number of molecules per  <dig> × 150 nm surface area was calculated, and intermolecular distance was calculated assuming a uniform distribution of molecules. the c3b molecules were then placed such that the center-to-center distance was equal to the calculated intermolecular distance . based on this model, it seems obvious that a concentration of  <dig>  molecules/μm <dig> is too low to allow c3b molecules to make direct contact, or to ‘sandwich’ a c <dig> molecule . such a ‘sandwich’ model, in which a c <dig> molecule is captured in between two c3b molecules, seems more likely at a density of  <dig>  molecules/μm <dig>  however, since c <dig> conversion rates clearly increase at higher densities , the c3b molecules might actually need to make direct contact  . in comparison, a density of  <dig>  c3b molecules/μm <dig> is equivalent to a concentration of 1 mm c3b molecules in fluid-phase , assuming that c3b molecules stand up straight due to thioester surface attachment). such a concentration is unlikely to be reached in vivo since normal plasma levels of c <dig> are 5 μm. thus, complement activation on surfaces facilitates high local concentrations of c3b unattainable in fluid-phase. likely, this explains why others and we have failed to demonstrate binding between c3b and c <dig> in solution. next to high surface density, it is still possible that a single c3b molecule adopts a different conformation in solution than when it is fixed to a surface. the ted of c3b is connected to the body of the c3b molecule via its cub domain  <cit> . recent studies indicated that the ted region is very flexible and gives the c3b molecule conformational variability that might potentially be altered when ted is fixed to a surface . while we observe that the orientation of c3b molecules  is critical for c <dig> convertase formation, our studies cannot exclude that the conformation of single c3b molecules attached to a surface is different from their conformation in solution. however, as our studies indicate that orientation of the c3b molecules on the surface is important for c <dig> convertase formation, the random distribution of c3b molecules in solution likely disfavors critical c3b-c3b or c3b-c <dig> interactions. a critical note should be placed on these models, since the distribution of c3b molecules on our beads is probably less uniform than depicted. since we make use of beads that are loaded with streptavidin molecules that, in principle, have four biotin binding sites, the c3b molecules on our beads might actually be closer together. also, it still remains to be determined how these numbers compare to c3b molecules on a natural biological surface where the thioester is anchored to surface-bound structures   <cit>  that would allow more flexibility and enhance intermolecular contacts. furthermore, under physiological conditions, the c <dig> convertase enzymes drive the deposition of c3b molecules close to the surface and it has been proposed that nascent c3b molecules deposit on the surface within a 600 Å radius around the c <dig> convertase, creating hotspots with c3b molecules at a high density  <cit> . probably, the densities that we create on streptavidin beads are very close to the c3b densities created by c <dig> convertases.fig.  <dig> molecular model for c3b density. a the crystallographic structure of c3b . b model for c3b density on a  <dig> × 150 nm area representing a portion of the bead surface. for each c3b density, the number of molecules per  <dig> × 150 nm surface area was calculated, and intermolecular distance was calculated assuming a uniform distribution of molecules. c3b molecules were then placed such that the center-to-center distance was equal to the calculated intermolecular distance. c3b is oriented such that the long axis is perpendicular to the surface and the thioester  was in contact with the surface



at least  <dig> different diseases can be traced to unwanted complement activation and there is an urgent medical need for improved treatments  <cit> . for many of these, the c <dig> convertase is considered an ideal target for complement therapy; blocking this protease would prevent formation of the major inflammatory trigger c5a but leave phagocytosis of bacteria intact  <cit> . also, since these protease complexes are exclusively formed on target cells, targeting the c <dig> convertase would allow a much more specific and localized treatment than inhibition of c <dig> in solution. since eculizumab, the first complement drug now used in the clinic, does not specifically block c <dig> activation on target cells, its inhibitory effects on solution phase c <dig> may predispose patients to serious meningococcal infections  <cit> . detailed molecular understanding and highly purified assay systems, like we describe in this study, will aid in the development of more specific therapeutic inhibitors targeting the c <dig> convertase. furthermore, our newly developed system also opens up new avenues of molecular research to understand how convertase can be regulated. there are a number of suggested c <dig> convertase regulatory proteins, evolved in humans  and bacteria  <cit> , for which the mode of action is unclear due to the lack of specific convertase models. we here characterize the mode of action of two potent c <dig> inhibitors, eculizumab and ssl <dig>  despite being effective c <dig> conversion blockers in plasma, it was never clear how these molecules function since they bind c <dig> at an interface that is distinct from the scissile bond  <cit> . now we show for the first time that both inhibitors prevent binding of c <dig> to surface-bound convertases. since the epitopes of eculizumab and ssl <dig> are on complete distant parts of the c <dig> molecule , these data strongly suggest that c <dig> has two distant sites involved in the interaction with multiple c3b molecules immobilized on surfaces. interestingly, the inhibitory analyses also show that c <dig> convertases on c3b beads are distinct from fluid-phase cvf convertases, but similar to naturally occurring c3b-dependent c <dig> convertases on bacterial surface.

CONCLUSIONS
 we establish a novel model system that allows functional and biochemical characterization of surface-specific c <dig> convertase enzymes.

 we demonstrate that high surface densities of c3b molecules are essential for the formation of c <dig> convertase complexes.

 we highlight important interfaces for the recognition of substrate c <dig> to surface-bound convertases.

 the developed model system opens up new areas of biomolecular research to understand hitherto unexplained mechanisms of convertase regulation.

 the provided insights and our newly developed model system allows new approaches of pharmaceutical research aimed at developing inhibitors of c <dig> convertases, which are important therapeutic targets in many inflammatory diseases.
