BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila is the major cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of legionellosis , with sero-group  <dig> being the predominant serotype   <cit> , among the  <dig> species and  <dig> sero-groups included in the genus legionella <cit> . outbreaks of l. pneumophila occur throughout the world impacting public health as well as various industrial, tourist, and social activities  <cit> . patients with immuno-compromised status are particularly susceptible to this atypical pneumonia  <cit> . this pathogen is present in both natural  <cit>  and man-made  <cit>  water environments like cooling towers, evaporative condensers, humidifiers, potable water systems, decorative fountains and wastewater systems . human infection can occur by inhalation of contaminated aerosols  <cit> . colonization at human-made water systems has been associated with biofilms yielding only some free bacterial cells  <cit> . moreover, rapid fluctuations of the concentration of l. pneumophila at risk facilities have been reported  <cit> , as well as persistence of l. pneumophila in drinking water biofilms mostly in a viable but non-culturable state   <cit> , which has also been confirmed even after treatments with chlorine used to disinfect cooling towers  <cit> . in fact, l. pneumophila becomes non-culturable in biofilms in doses of  <dig> mg/l of monochloramine, making culture detection of this pathogen ineffective  <cit> . the effectiveness of treatments on legionella pneumophila  has been mainly evaluated based simply on cultivability and that could not be a real indicative of the absence of intact viable cells  <cit> .

official methods for legionella detection are based on the growth of the microorganism in selective media  <cit> . at least  <dig> to  <dig> days are required for obtaining results due to the slow growth rate of the bacterium. culture detection also shows low sensitivity, loss of viability of bacteria after collection, difficulty in isolating legionella in samples contaminated with other microbial and the inability to detect vbnc bacteria  <cit> . therefore, the development of a rapid and specific detection method for l. pneumophila monitoring and in real time would be crucial for the efficient prevention of legionellosis. polymerase chain reaction  methods have been described as useful tools for l. pneumophila detection  <cit> . pcr reportedly provides high specificity, sensitivity, and speed, low detection limits and the possibility to quantify the concentration of the microorganisms in the samples using real-time pcr. however, it requires sophisticated and expensive equipment, appropriate installations and trained personnel  <cit> . pcr inhibiting compounds present in environmental samples may cause false negatives. inhibition control is strongly recommended in those cases. samples having inhibition must be diluted and retested. false positives can be caused by the inability of pcr to differentiate between cells and free dna  <cit> . finally, the cell number assigned to a certain amount of target genes varies by one order of magnitude depending on the growth phase and bacteria species, limiting the capability of pcr test for accurate bacterial quantification  <cit> . immuno-detection has provided the basis for the development of powerful analytical tools for a wide range of targets. during the last years, the number of publications in this field has increased significantly  <cit> . traditionally, the most common method applied to microorganism detection has been the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . the main drawback of elisa is the high detection limit generated; which is often between  <dig> and  <dig> cfu/ml  <cit> . this limit may be improved to  <dig> and  <dig> cells/ml using more sensitive detection methods  <cit> . the immobilization of antibodies onto the surface of magnetic beads to obtain immunomagnetic beads  has promoted the development of immunomagnetic separation . thereby, ims provides a simple but powerful method for specific capture, recovery and concentration of the desired microorganism from heterogeneous bacterial suspension  <cit> .

a test based on ims by anti-l. pneumophila immuno-modified magnetic beads , coupled to enzyme-linked colorimetric detection has been proposed for the rapid detection of l. pneumophila cells in water samples  <cit> . in this study, intensive comparison of this immunomagnetic method  with the culture method is presented.

RESULTS
comparative trial with natural samples
the imm test was applicable to detection of l. pneumophila in water samples. a total of  <dig> water samples, comprising both naturally contaminated and artificially contaminated samples were examined for the presence of l. pneumophila using the reference culture method  and the imm test in parallel. the parameters for this comparison study were calculated from the results summarized in table  <dig> as it is described in the methods section. sensitivity and specificity were estimated as  <dig> %  and 88% , respectively for the imm. this means that a proportion of actual positives and negatives are correctly assigned by the imm test. false positives and false negatives were estimated as, respectively,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . some “false” positives could be related to problems in the culture method, as stated in the background that presents some limitations under different circumstances  <cit> . in fact, the pcr analysis of some of the samples initially considered false positives confirmed later the existence of dna from l. pneumophila in those samples , suggesting a failure of the culture method. from the point of view of the imm as a screening test with culture confirmation, presumptive test negative results can be added to the true negatives. in this case sensitivity and specificity were estimated as, respectively,  <dig> %  and 100%  for the imm. false positives and false negatives were estimated as, respectively, 0%  and  <dig> % . the low false negative ratio suggests that the imm is very reliable.

a presumptive imm results.

b confirmed imm results.

efficiency of the imm as screening assay without confirmation was estimated as  <dig> % . the imm with confirming culture method had an efficiency of  <dig> %. this means that results obtained with the imm test exhibited a high agreement with the reference culture method.

detection limit
the detection limit of the imm test was determined by testing water samples spiked with different l. pneumophila  concentrations at  <dig> different levels . the detection limit was defined as the lowest number of cultivable l. pneumophila organisms  that can be detected with a probability of 50%. on the basis of this criterion, the detection limit of imm for l. pneumophila was determined as  <dig> cfu per volume examined for the studied matrices. here the volume examined is the filtered volume of the original water sample.

collaborative trial
table  <dig> shows the results of the eleven accepted laboratories that have evaluated the imm test. the concentrations estimated by the color chart of the imm test were highly coincident with the reported culture results for each one of the three groups of samples prepared with certified reference material  containing l. pneumophila. for the two pills used as negative control, not having l. pneumophila, this bacterium was not detected by any of the two methods  in any of the participating laboratories. coincidence between both methods was of  <dig> %. comparison gave good results, with clear coincidence with the standard culture method but a higher rate of analysis.

discussion
this study confirms the suitability of the imm test for the detection of l. pneumophila in water samples. the final protocol comprised sample pre-concentration by filtration and resuspension, magnetic capture using immunoactivated beads, and colorimetric enzyme-linked immunodetection in just  <dig> h of analysis, while the standard protocol requires 7– <dig> days. sensitivity , specificity , false positives , false negatives , and efficiency  were determined. the lod <dig> was only  <dig> cfu of l. pneumophila in the volume examined for the selected matrices, which is significantly below the values reported for other conventional methods such as elisa. this occurs even though some of the samples  presented viscosity and dirtiness that made handling difficult.

CONCLUSIONS
in view of these results, the imm test could be a valuable tool for the rapid, simple and robust detection of free l. pneumophila at risk installations, in a weekly and even daily basis, contributing to minimize the risk of outbreaks by this pathogen. at theses environments, presence of l. pneumophila or a high percentage of positive points, have been identified as factors contributing to explain case onset  <cit> . the reported combination of magnetic capture and enzyme-immunoassay provides a user-friendly and extremely easy to use assay format, which is a valuable low-cost tool for the implementation of in situ surveillance, development of water safety plans, or fast screening of water samples. in combination with other established techniques, such culture and pcr, addressed to isolation and identification of l. pneumophila, imm could be useful for an integral surveillance. from the results presented in this study, legipid imm test is a very promising tool to fight against legionellosis and similar configurations could be used to detect other dangerous pathogens.
