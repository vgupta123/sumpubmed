BACKGROUND
among the  <dig> known aphid species worldwide, approximately one hundred have exploited the agricultural environment, and their ability to rapidly colonize crops makes aphids serious pests  <cit> . once an aphid settles on crops, it simultaneously feeds and reproduces. an aphid pushes its stylets through layers of plant tissue to reach the phloem. the path from the epidermis to the phloem is intercellular, and an aphid salivates while moving along this path, developing a protective sheath against plant defense. when its stylets are tightly inserted in the phloem, an aphid begins removing photoassimilates by continuous fluid ingestion that causes direct damage to the plant. on crops, aphid reproduction is mainly parthenogenetic with telescoping generations what leads to multiple generations on a crop in a single season. aphid proliferation on plants can cause stunting, severe leaf curling and plant death. moreover, short probing punctures in cells along the path to the phloem allow the acquisition/transmission of non-persistent viruses  <cit> . when the stylets reach the phloem, the acquisition/transmission of persistent viruses can occur  <cit> .

the management of aphids infesting crops is clearly challenging. pesticide sprays are predominantly used to combat aphids. since the 1980s, many species have developed resistance to insecticides, particularly two cosmopolitan and polyphagous aphids, myzus persicae  and aphis gossypii   <cit> . screening germplasms for plant resistance led to the discovery of accessions in several crop species that displayed resistance to various aphid species. however, the sources of plant resistance to aphids are limited and rare  <cit> , and the relatively high number of resistant accessions discovered in certain species should not mask the fact that resistance to aphid typically arises from a small number of genes with only a few resistance alleles. in practice, plant genes that confer resistance to aphids have been primarily introduced into cultivated varieties of cereals, fruit trees and vegetables, and some resistant varieties have been deployed on a large scale  <cit> . evidence from biotypes  indicates that some aphid species can adapt to plant resistance genes. the gene ag <dig>  which confers resistance to amphorophora agathonica, was extensively used in raspberry for fifty years before a resistance-breaking biotype appeared  <cit> . resistance to nasonovia ribisnigri is conferred by the nr gene in lettuce, and breakdown of this resistance occurred 10 years after the gene’s wide deployment  <cit> . the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia overcame the resistance gene dn <dig> less than 10 years after the gene had been released in wheat cultivars  <cit> . adapted biotypes of schizaphis graminum, were observed prior to the deployment of some resistances in wheat  <cit> . our objective was to investigate aphid adaptation to plant resistance in a system in which plant resistance and aphid diversity have been well characterized: cucumis melo and a. gossypii.

cucumis melo, originating from asia  <cit> , is one of the main species within the cucurbitaceae family. c. melo is found throughout the world, exhibiting considerable genetic diversity in cultivated and wild genotypes  <cit> . melon crops are only colonized by a. gossypii, a cosmopolitan aphid. to date, fewer than twenty multilocus genotypes , as revealed by  <dig> ssr markers, have been observed developing colonies on melon plants . resistant melon accessions have been largely described since the 1970s; they originated from east and far east asia, europe, africa, america  <cit> . early open-field studies revealed that melon resistance to the us southeastern biotype of aphids was ineffective against the southwestern biotype  <cit>  and vice versa.  <cit> . in the same manner, low resistance levels to a. gossypii from spain were observed in laboratory biotests in melon accessions that exhibited a high level of resistance to french a. gossypii  <cit> . therefore adapted clones of a. gossypii were already observed, prior to the deployment of resistance in melon crops in some regions. recently, thomas et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a. gossypii biotypes can be related to mlgs. clones sharing the same mlg exhibit a similar acceptance on a set of melon accessions . nevertheless, the fitness of the clones sharing the same mlg exhibited some variation. a. gossypii is an efficient vector of viruses transmitted in a non-persistent manner such as cucumber mosaic virus , zucchini yellow mosaic virus , watermelon mosaic virus  and papaya ringspot virus  and an efficient vector of the cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus  transmitted in a persistent manner.

in  <dig>  a melon cultivar in the french catalog, margot, was declared resistant to aphids for the first time. this resistance has been characterized using two a. gossypii clones, nm <dig> and c <dig>  it is controlled by a major gene, vat, and several quantitative trait loci that have been localized in the melon genome  <cit> . the vat gene encodes a coiled-coil -nucleotide-binding site -leucine-rich repeat  protein  <cit> . the resistance genes belonging to this family are widely assumed to be involved in the specific recognition of pathogen and pest effectors and the activation of plant defense responses  <cit> . recently, the efficacy of this resistance was jeopardized in southeastern france and was overcome in the lesser antilles .

altogether, this raises two questions:  how broad is the resistance conferred by the vat gene in the face of a. gossypii diversity?  are broader forms of resistance available other than vat-mediated resistance among genetically diverse melon? using a set of aphid clones, we revealed a limited spectrum of vat resistance, and we identified melon accessions exhibiting larger spectra controlled by at least another locus linked to the vat gene.

moreover, melon plants harboring the resistance vat gene are susceptible to viruses when inoculated mechanically or using other aphid species as vectors  <cit> , but these vat plants become resistant to non-persistent viruses when inoculated by the nm <dig> and c <dig> a. gossypii biotypes  <cit> . in other words, when transmitting non-persistent viruses, nm <dig> and c <dig> biotypes trigger resistance to these viruses  <cit> . thus, two additional questions are raised:  do all aphid biotypes, regardless of their ability to circumvent vat-mediated resistance, trigger resistance to viruses?  are viruses able to adapt to vat-mediated resistance? we showed that clone ability to colonize vat-plants was not a predictor of a lack of ability to trigger the resistance to virus. we also showed that viruses were not able to adapt to vat-mediated resistance.

RESULTS
patterns of resistance observed in a vat-transgenic line and  <dig> melon accessions with nine a. gossypii clones 
we observed  <dig> plant-aphid-virus interactions,  <dig> melon lines interacting with  <dig> aphid clones and two transgenic lines interacting with either  <dig> or  <dig> clones. these interactions were characterized for three traits, ‘plant response to cmv’ triggered by aphids, ‘acceptance’ and ‘colonization’ by aphids. the biotests were conducted from  <dig> to  <dig>  margot and védrantais were included in all tests and used as references to standardize the results obtained over years.

scoring of the two reference lines védrantais and margot
the percentage of plants exhibiting cmv symptoms after inoculation by an aphid clone was a quantitative trait . then védrantais and margot/ aphid clone interactions were scored s  or r . védrantais was susceptible to cmv inoculated by all clones with the exception of c <dig>  and margot was resistant to cmv inoculated by all clones with the exception of c <dig> fig.  <dig> scoring for three traits of  <dig> references lines x  <dig> aphid clones combinations. a percentage of melon plants with cmv symptoms after inoculation by nine clones of a. gossypii. group: significant difference  based on pairwise comparison by χ <dig> statistics with bonferroni correction . score: score for each combination. b acceptance = number of aphids on the plant 72 h after infestation by  <dig> aphids. group: significant difference  after a non-parametric test  with bonferroni correction. score: score for each combination. c. ability to colonize observed 7 days after infestation by  <dig> aphids. group: significant difference  after a non-parametric test  with bonferroni correction. score: score for each combination



‘acceptance’ was estimated as the number of adult aphids remaining on a plantlet three days after infestation by  <dig> adults and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the reference lines . this trait was quantitative and ‘acceptance’ scores were determined as follows. because the lowest ‘acceptance’ was observed for nm <dig> on margot, a score of  <dig> was given for this interaction. a score of + <dig>  i.e.  <dig>  was given to the interaction exhibiting the closest significantly different ‘acceptance’ from the nm1/margot interaction, i.e. the cucu3/margot interaction. a score of  <dig> was given to the next interaction exhibiting the closest significantly different ‘acceptance’ from the cucu3/margot interaction, i.e. cucu3/védrantais, and so on. intermediate scores were given when the differences were not significant. ‘acceptance’ scores ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

‘colonization’ was calculated from the number of nymphs and adults on a plantlet 7 days after infestation. this trait also was quantitative ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . a score of  <dig> was given for the lowest ‘colonization’ observed . the next result observed  that was significant and largely greater than the first result was given a score of + <dig>  i.e.  <dig>  the same procedure outlined for ‘acceptance’ was followed . ‘colonization’ scores ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

these scores were used as references when analyzing the following interactions.

vat resistance spectrum defined on a vat transgenic line
the vat resistance spectrum to  <dig> clones of a. gossypii was established using the vat transgenic line tr <dig> based on the three parameters described above. scores for the three parameters were given to each combination  in comparison to the scores given for each combination ‘reference line/ aphid clone’.

the tr <dig> line was resistant to cmv when inoculated by c <dig>  gwd <dig> and nm <dig> clones proving that the gene was efficient where it was inserted in védrantais . tr <dig> was susceptible to cmv when inoculated by c <dig>  cuc <dig> and gwd clones. to confirm that susceptibility to cmv in tr <dig> was not due to an insertion effect, cmv was inoculated by nm <dig> and gwd to another transgenic line, tr <dig>  in accordance with results obtained on tr <dig>  tr <dig> was resistant to cmv when inoculated by nm <dig> and susceptible to cmv when inoculated by gwd.table  <dig> scores for cmv for  <dig> melon/aphid interactions

resistance to aphid and resistance to virus triggered by aphids in natural melon diversity
the spectrum of resistance across natural melon diversity was established using  <dig> melon accessions infested with nine a. gossypii clones. scores for the three parameters were given to each combination  in comparison to the scores given for each combination ‘reference line/aphid clones’.

we revealed eight patterns of resistance to cmv triggered by aphids across the natural melon diversity . all melon accessions were resistant to cmv when inoculated by c <dig>  even védrantais, which is typically considered a susceptible control. to check if c <dig> was an efficient vector of cmv we observed a set of cucurbits inoculated by cmv using c <dig>  several melon lines, zucchini squash and cucumber exhibited symptoms  proving that c <dig> was able to transmit cmv. other aphid clones were able to inoculate cmv to védrantais, proving their vectoring capacity. sixty percent of the interactions  exhibited a resistant plant response. surprisingly, pi  <dig>  the accession used to isolate the vat gene, did not exhibit the same pattern of resistance to cmv as the transgenic line tr <dig>  in the same way, none lines amplifying the marker developed from the vat gene  did exhibit the same pattern of resistance to cmv as tr <dig>  pi  <dig> was the only accession resistant to cmv when inoculated by all the clones tested.

‘acceptance’ and ‘colonization’ were scored from − <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively but no accession was poorly accepted and poorly colonized by all aphid clones: i.e. no accession exhibited a large resistance spectrum to aphids . as a matter of fact, several clones heavily colonized the accessions amplifying the vat gene  and then were adapted to the vat-resistance. the least colonized accession was am <dig>  exhibiting a median score of  <dig>  whereas margot and pi  <dig> exhibited a median colonization score of  <dig>  all other accessions and the tr <dig> line exhibited higher median colonization scores.

of the  <dig> melon accession /aphid clone interactions we studied,  <dig> cases of resistance to cmv triggered by aphids were observed. out of them,  <dig> cases exhibited low acceptance  and only  <dig> exhibited low colonization . for the clone c <dig>  the high colonization of all accessions was discordant with the resistance to cmv triggered by this clone in all accessions. therefore the resistance to virus triggered by aphids was decoupled from the resistance to aphid: low ‘acceptance’ was a poor predictor of resistance to virus triggered by aphids  and low ‘colonization’ was not a predictor of resistance to virus triggered by aphids and vice-versa .fig.  <dig> relationship between resistance to a. gossypii and resistance to virus triggered by a. gossypii. distribution of  <dig> interactions  according to aphid a acceptance and b colonization, and interactions exhibiting either a resistant or susceptible phenotype after cmv inoculation by aphids



virus ability to adapt to resistance triggered by aphid
it is possible that viruses can overcome vat-mediated resistance, by escaping the defense mechanisms induced by an a. gossypii effector, and develop systemic infections after serial transmission events on vat plants. to test this hypothesis, sequential virus transmissions from infected vat-carrying margot plants to healthy margot plants were established using the nm <dig> or c <dig> aphid clones with three viruses, cmv, zymv and wmv. no virus evolved in response to resistance triggered by nm <dig> or c <dig> .fig.  <dig> experimental evolution of wmv, zymv and cmv on vat plants. number of vat plants exhibiting symptoms/number of tested plants after virus inoculation by the nm <dig> and c <dig> a. gossypii clones. for the primary inoculations, aphids acquired viruses from susceptible infected plants. for the following inoculations, aphids acquired viruses from previously infected vat plants. 



when for the first time viruses were inoculated by nm <dig> into margot, no wmv infected plants were obtained from the  <dig> plants tested, one zymv infected plant was obtained from the  <dig> plants tested, and one cmv infected plant was obtained among  <dig> plants. after back-inoculation from margot to margot from the two infected plants, the percentage of plants infected did not increase regardless of the virus tested .

more infected plants were obtained by the c <dig> clone than after inoculation by the nm <dig> clone, thus allowing for easier back-inoculations. again, we did not observe an increase of the percentage of infected plants, even after the fourth back-inoculation .

discussion
among all of the known plant genes that confer resistance to aphids  <cit> , the vat gene is unique in that it also confers resistance to viruses when inoculated by aphids  <cit> . this resistance is restricted to the a. gossypii species  <cit> , but its efficacy against the large diversity of a. gossypii remains unknown. in addition, allelic variation at the vat locus inducing phenotypical variation has been only hypothetical until now. given that resistance to virus triggered by aphids was demonstrated to be qualitative, this trait can be used to describe biotypes of a. gossypii species. accordingly to smith   <cit> , biotypes are revealed on a set of cultivars, each possessing a different resistance gene or gene combination that react differentially to a given biotype. based on the plant response of  <dig> melon accessions to cmv inoculation by  <dig> aphid clones, i.e.  <dig> interactions, we recognized six aphid biotypes. the first biotype is represented by c <dig> and triggered resistance to cmv in  <dig> accessions. the second biotype consists of c <dig> and cuc <dig>  and triggered resistance to cmv in  <dig> accessions. the third biotype, which consists of cucu <dig> and putatively gwd, triggered resistance in the same set of accessions as the previous biotype, as well as anso  <dig>  the fourth and fifth biotypes are represented by gwd <dig> and nm <dig>  respectively, and triggered resistance to cmv in  <dig> accessions . the sixth biotype is represented by c <dig> and triggered resistance to cmv in  <dig> accessions.

are the different patterns of resistance to cmv controlled by the same locus, namely the vat locus?
we revealed an unexpected partial pattern of resistance of the vat gene. the vat gene, isolated from the pi  <dig> accession, was characterized using one clone, nm1-lab  <cit> . a recent study at the agrosystem level suggested that the vat gene confers resistance to a large number of a. gossypii clones  <cit> . regarding pi  <dig>  eight out of the nine clones assessed triggered the resistance to cmv when used as vectors, suggesting again that a large number of a. gossypii clones triggers resistance to cmv in vat plants. to confirm this result, we studied this trait in a vat transgenic line. among five clones triggering high levels of resistance to cmv in pi  <dig>  only three triggered a high level of resistance to cmv in the transgenic line. these data indicate that at least an additional locus is involved in resistance to cmv triggered by aphid in pi  <dig> 

on this basis, we proposed to rename the vat locus vat- <dig>  the vat- <dig> allele from pi  <dig> is amplified by the specific marker z <dig> and confers resistance to cmv upon inoculation by c <dig>  gwd <dig>  nm <dig>  and putatively by c <dig>  we proposed to name vat- <dig> the additional locus present in pi  <dig>  this allele confers at least resistance to cmv upon inoculation by gwd. vat- <dig> is likely tightly linked to vat- <dig> in pi  <dig> because it cosegregated with vat-1during the breeding program for constructing margot when aphid resistance was introgressed and selected at each generation using the nm <dig> clone. in addition, this locus remained evident in a quasi-isogenic line,  obtained after fifteen back-crosses and selection for resistance using the nm <dig> clone. this quasi-isogenic line, resistant to cmv inoculated by nm <dig> and gwd shares  <dig>  % of its genome with the susceptible recurrent parent, and therefore the  <dig>  % remaining contained vat- <dig> and vat- <dig>  védrantais, which served as the susceptible control, was surprisingly resistant to cmv inoculated by c <dig>  and because védrantais contains neither vat- <dig> nor vat- <dig> alleles detected in pi  <dig>  other locus or allele is  likely involved in resistance to cmv when inoculated by c <dig>  in the same way, smith perfect, canton and hsd <dig> shared susceptibility to cmv when inoculated by nm <dig>  therefore do not carry the vat- <dig> allele detected in pi  <dig>  and resistance to cmv when inoculated by c <dig>  a resistance elicited neither by vat- <dig> nor by vat- <dig> detected in pi  <dig> 

a 1-mb region that contains vat- <dig> exhibits the highest concentration of presence/absence gene variation polymorphisms found in the melon genome  <cit> , and this type of polymorphism is often related to phenotypic diversity in resistance to pathogens. this region also exhibits the highest density of resistance genes in the melon genome  <cit> . twenty-three genes of the nbs-lrr family have been identified in this 1-mb region  <cit> , that potentially corresponds to less than 20 cm, and these genes are candidates for vat- <dig>  an homolog of vat- <dig> in  <dig> shared  <dig>  % identity at the dna level and  <dig>  % at the protein level with vat- <dig> from pi  <dig>  <cit> . the numerous duplications in the region have made accurate sequencing difficult, therefore comprehensive crossing between molecular and phenotypic data is required to fully understand the genetic control of resistance to aphid and resistance to virus triggered by aphids. the use of transgenic lines will clearly help to decipher the role of each locus in this cluster.

what have we learned from the pleiotropic resistance mediated by the vat gene?
recently, plant/aphid interactions have been included in the general framework of the plant immune system developed for plant/pathogen interactions  <cit> . given that the vat- <dig> gene encodes an nbs-lrr protein that is similar to numerous resistance genes to pathogens, resistance is likely initiated by the specific recognition of aphid effector proteins  <cit> . recognition activates signaling cascades; the only nbs-lrr gene-controlled cascade identified among plant resistance to aphids is the salicylic acid signaling pathway activated by macrosiphum euphorbiae in mi-1-tomato plants  <cit> . this pathway also elicits resistance to virus  <cit> . in vat-melon, the cascade elicits plant defenses against aphids and viruses. physiological responses at a. gossypii feeding sites include very early deposits of callose and lignin in the cell walls, an increased peroxidase activity, phenol synthesis and a micro-oxidative burst  <cit> . these physiological responses constitute a microscopic hypersensitive response in the leaf tissues of vat plants infested by a. gossypii. some mirnas that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level have been shown to be up-regulated during the early stages of aphid infestation in vat-resistant plants and down-regulated in susceptible plants  <cit> .

some phenotypes observed in the vat transgenic line are consistent with the framework described above. resistance is initiated by the specific recognition of an aphid effector that activates signaling cascades that elicit plant defenses against aphids and viruses . phenotypes observed with the nm <dig> and c <dig> clones matched this scheme: both clones trigger resistance to cmv and were unable to fully colonize the vat transgenic line. considering resistance to virus triggered by aphids and low acceptance,  <dig> interactions among  <dig> studied in the natural diversity also matches this scheme. when there was no recognition of the aphid effector, plant defenses against aphids and viruses were not elicited . the phenotypes observed with the c <dig> and gwd clones matched this scheme given that these clones did not mediate resistance to cmv and fully colonized the vat transgenic line. considering resistance to virus triggered by aphids and low acceptance,  <dig> interactions among  <dig> studied in the natural diversity also matches this scheme. no aphid effector specifically recognized by an nbs-lrr resistance protein has been described to date; however, dozens of avirulence genes have been identified in plant pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. these avirulence genes seem to be subject to high-speed diversifying selection  <cit> , and this phenomenon might also be true for avirulence genes in aphids.fig.  <dig> model for a. gossypii/vat-melon plant interaction: the  <dig> cases observed, a resistance to aphids and viruses, b susceptibility to aphids and resistance to viruses, c susceptibility to aphids and viruses, d resistance to aphids and susceptibility to viruses, which was not observed



a third group of phenotypes in the vat-transgenic line did not fit the framework. the gwd <dig> clone triggered resistance to cmv, therefore the specific recognition of the gwd <dig> effector that activates the signaling cascades that elicit plant defenses must have occurred, but gwd <dig> colonized the vat transgenic line. we hypothesized that the decoupling of resistance to aphid from resistance to virus was due to aphid adaptation, thus allowing aphids to colonize plants even when plant defenses were elicited . the clone cuc <dig> partially fits this scheme. this clone fully colonized the transgenic line but appeared to occasionally mediate resistance to cmv . cuc <dig> might produce a low quantity of its avirulence effector, and the cells  receiving the virus particles without the effector allowed the virus to spread systemically. however, plants with all cells receiving both virus particles and the effector did not permit viral multiplication.

in the natural diversity, the phenotype ‘resistance to virus triggered by aphids’/‘susceptibility to aphids’ was frequent. of the  <dig> cases of resistance to cmv triggered by aphid clones, we observed  <dig> cases with acceptance scores ≥ <dig> and still more cases,  <dig>  with colonization scores ≥ <dig>  the c <dig>  cuc <dig>  and c <dig> clones colonized all melon accessions in which they triggered resistance to cmv. the cuc <dig> and gwd <dig> clones colonized all melon accessions but one in which they triggered resistance to cmv. ‘colonization’ that results from acceptance, daily fecundity, pre-reproductive period and clone mortality exhibits quantitative variation among clones sharing the same mlg and is hypothesized to be controlled by several aphid genes  <cit> . adaptation to plant resistance could result from polymorphisms and/or regulation of these genes. comparative analyses of aphids feeding on vat and non-vat plants has revealed that mirnas are differentially regulated during resistant and susceptible interactions  <cit> . the abundance of piwi-interacting rna-like sequences  in aphids feeding on vat plants raises questions about their involvement in aphid responses to vat-mediated resistance. in the russian wheat aphid , differences in the dna methylation level of four genes that presumably encode proteins and enzymes in aphid salivary glands, in addition to high levels of polymorphisms, were noted between two clones exhibiting different virulences on host plants  <cit> .

are viruses able to adapt to vat resistance triggered by aphids?
a fourth putative scheme might occur , i.e. virus adaptation to defenses triggered by a. gossypii probing on vat plants. the expected phenotype is ‘susceptibility to virus when inoculated by an aphid clone incapable of colonizing vat plants’. this double phenotype was never observed in the transgenic line, suggesting viral adaptation did not occur. nevertheless, this double phenotype was observed twice in natural melons; both instances involved anso  <dig> and the clones c <dig> and cuc <dig>  does this mean that both clones triggered resistance in anso but that the cmv-i17f isolate had adapted to this resistance? this is an unlikely explanation given that anso  <dig> was highly resistant to cmv when resistance was triggered by nm <dig>  c <dig>  gwd <dig>  gwd, or cucu <dig>  resistance to colonization of anso  <dig> by c <dig> and cuc <dig> was most likely conferred by gene other than the vat gene; this other gene exclusively acts against aphids, similar to all other resistance genes described in crops. the inability of viruses to adapt to defenses triggered by the puncturing of vat plants by a. gossypii was confirmed by experimental evolution biotests wherein cmv, as well as zymv, failed to evolve when facing plant defenses triggered by aphid probing. therefore, regarding the virus, vat-mediated resistance to viruses appeared durable in contrast to several nbs-lrr resistance to virus, such as tm- <dig> or sw- <dig>  the practical use of these genes is limited because the resistance conferred by the genes can be overcome by naturally occurring strains  <cit> . while common nbs-lrr resistances to virus are triggered by an avr viral protein  <cit> , the absence of viral involvement in the recognition of the vat protein was clearly established by the fact that vat plants are systemically infected when viruses are mechanically transmitted or transmitted by m. persicae  <cit> . this phenomenon could ensure vat durability against non-persistently transmitted virus. to overcome vat-mediated resistance, viruses should evolve toward faster cell-to-cell movements after a. gossypii inoculative puncturing, to escape the resistance mechanisms induced by an a. gossypii effector. such evolution has not been observed in our experimental evolution biotests.

CONCLUSIONS
the resistance to viruses that is conferred on melon by a. gossypii puncturing appears durable, and this resistance is controlled by at least two loci, vat- <dig> and vat- <dig>  tightly linked. different alleles likely mediate resistance to virus upon inoculation by specific aphid clones. unfortunately, because numerous aphid species transmit viruses to melon crops, vat resistance does not always significantly reduce viral epidemics in melon fields  <cit> .

resistance to a. gossypii in melon plants appeared very strong for only one clone, nm <dig>  and partial or null for other clones. building complex resistance to aphids required a better understanding of the genetic control using an aphid biotype-base strategy.

considering ‘acceptance’ and ‘resistance to virus elicited by aphids’, 97 % of interactions in natural diversity fit with three schemes we proposed. these schemes suggested that aphid clones were adapted to plant resistance because their avirulence factors did not trigger resistance or because they could colonize the plants even if they elicited the defenses. if the latter is a general mechanism of plant resistance/aphid interactions, it would make the identification of avirulence factors challenging, given that adapted and non adapted clones could share a same avirulence effector interacting  with the protein encoded by the resistance gene.
