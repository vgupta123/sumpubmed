BACKGROUND
food-borne enteric viruses, particularly human noroviruses , rotaviruses  and hepatitis a virus , constitute a serious public health concern, since they are responsible for the vast majority of cases of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and infectious hepatitis, which may occasionally be fatal  <cit> . these viruses are able to replicate in the human gastro-intestinal tract and are dispersed by shedding in high concentrations into the stools. the stability of these viruses with regard to several physical conditions such as ph and temperature, and their resistance to different treatment systems, contribute significantly to their persistence in the environment  <cit> . transmission of these viruses occurs by the faecal-oral route, primarily through direct person-to-person contact, but they are also efficiently transmitted by ingestion of contaminated drinking water or contaminated foods such as raw shellfish, fresh fruits and vegetables  <cit> .

to ensure the safety of these products, the development of sensitive, reliable techniques for the detection of enteric viruses in food and water samples is helpful. the cell culture system is the gold standard to examine the infectivity of the isolated viruses. currently, detection of the main enteric viruses on the basis of their infectivity is complicated by the absence of a reliable cell culture method and the low contamination levels of food samples. thus, molecular methods have been developed for the rapid detection of viral contamination of foods  <cit> . in  <dig>  the european committee for standardisation  asked a technical advisory group  to develop standard methods  for the detection of norovirus and hav in foodstuffs. standard methods have recently been elaborated for a range of risk foods including bottled water, soft fruits and vegetables. the cen/iso/ts  <dig> standard was published in the first half of  <dig> and within a year these proposed protocols will be validated and then published as iso or cen standard methods  <cit> . all these methods are based on a final detection of the viral genome using real-time reverse transcriptase pcr , used for its sensitivity, specificity, speed and ability to deliver quantitative data. however, this approach detects the viral nucleic acids of both infectious and non-infectious viruses.

therefore, it is important to develop and evaluate simple and efficient tools which make it possible to overcome the limitations of the traditional cell culture and pcr assays  <cit> . an approach based on an enzymatic treatment with rnase combined with a proteinase k treatment was found to be successful in some cases in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious viruses  <cit> . for bacteria, a relatively recent approach is the treatment of samples with the dna-intercalating dyes ethidium monoazide  or propidium monoazide   <cit> . ema and pma are closely related dna intercalating dyes with a photo-inducible azide group that covalently cross-link to dna through visible-light photoactivation. pma has the advantage of being more selective than ema for dead cells as it is more membrane-impermeant  <cit> . recently, promising pma / ema treatments have also been tested for distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious rna viruses  <cit> . a study concluded that pma-rt-pcr assays that include pretreatment of enteroviruses and noroviruses with pma prior to rt-pcr enable rapid differentiation between infectious and non-infectious enteric viruses when the virus particles are inactivated by heating at 72°c or 37°c or by using hypochlorite. however, unlike poliovirus, pma treatment did not affect detection of heat-inactivated norwalk virus by quantitative rt-pcr  <cit> . another study found that ema did not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious avian influenza virus particles  <cit> . sánchez et al.  <cit>  showed that pma treatment previous to rt-qpcr detection is a promising alternative for assessing hav infectivity.

the usefulness of ema or pma for distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious rv and hav was investigated. both viruses were chosen for their cultivability and their differences in genomic organization. rv, the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, are non-enveloped viruses that possess a genome with  <dig> segments of double-stranded rna contained in a triple-layered protein capsid and belong to the reoviridae. hepatitis a virus  infection is the leading worldwide cause of acute viral hepatitis. hav is a positive single-stranded non-enveloped rna virus classified in the hepatovirus genus of the picornaviridae family.

the purpose of this study was to develop a method based on pre-treatment-rt-qpcr assays in order to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious viruses  following thermal inactivation. to this end, the binding of ema and pma to rv and hav rna was investigated. then, a pre-treatment based on “pma or ema +/− surfactant rt-qpcr” was optimized for each virus. finally, this method was applied to establish viral thermal inactivation kinetics through three rt-qpcr assays.

RESULTS
standard curves of rt-qpcr assays on viral rna
linear regression analyses were performed by plotting the cycle threshold  values against the logarithm of the pfu of hav or tcid <dig>  of rv  with rt-qpcr assays a, b and c corresponding to the rna target. the mean parameters of the standard curves were as follows: standard curves respectively obtained with hav assays a, b and c showed efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and regression coefficients of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ; standard curves respectively obtained with rv assays a, b and c showed efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and regression coefficients of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  with wa; standard curves respectively obtained with rv assays a, b and c showed efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and regression coefficients of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  with sa <dig> 

evaluation of dyes-rt-qpcr assays on viral rna
the first experiments studied the efficiency of pma and ema treatments to bind the viral rna in order to avoid its detection  using rt-qpcr assays a and the potential inhibitory effects of the dyes on rt-qpcr amplification . viral rna was treated with dye concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 200 μm without photoactivation and then subjected to rt-qpcr to determine if residual dyes can be inhibitors for rt-qpcr . in the lowest pma concentration , an inhibitory effect on rt-qpcr detection was only found for rv rna  . with 20 μm of pma, an inhibitory effect on rt-qpcr was also found for hav rna . pma concentrations ranging from 50 μm to 200 μm were able to totally inhibit the rt-qpcr amplification of viral rna. inhibitory effects of ema were found from 20 μm on rv  , and from 50 μm on hav . higher concentrations of ema totally inhibited rt-qpcr assays on hav and rv  viral rna. inversely, no inhibitory effect of any of the ema concentrations tested was observed with rv  rna. the efficacy of the purification of excess dye in treated rna samples using the qiaquick pcr purification kit was tested to avoid inhibitory effects on rt-qpcr amplification . purification by qia-quick showed effective recovery with a decrease in viral titer ≤ −  <dig>  log <dig> with rna samples not treated with monoazide. the purification step was found to be effective in removing residual dye, except for rv  rna samples which were treated with pma ranging from  <dig> to 200 μm.

quantification by rt-qpcr assays a of  <dig> copies of the genome of viral rna after monoazide treatment without photoactivation , after monoazide treatment without photoactivation followed by qia-quick purification , after monoazide treatment with photoactivation followed by qia-quick purification . mean values ± sd .

lastly, optimal pma / ema concentrations were determined on viral rna samples after dye treatment including photoactivation and purification steps. the effects of dye  were determined by measuring the decrease in rna quantification by rt-qpcr . pma at 50 μm enabled the highest reduction of the rt-qpcr signal for hav rna  and pma at  <dig> and 200 μm respectively enabled the highest reductions of the rt-qpcr signal for rv   and rv  . ema was still found to be less efficient than pma treatment for all the viral rna tested. these data showed that pma and ema are able to bind to viral rna upon photoactivation making the rna unavailable for amplification by rt-qpcr, although excess dye concentrations can inhibit rt-qpcr assays. the effectiveness of pma and ema treatments depends on the type of dye, the concentration of the dye and the viral rna type, although pma was found to be the most effective dye for the three viral rna tested.

optimization of pretreatment combining dyes and surfactants before rt-qpcr assays for the selective detection of infectious viruses
determination of optimal pma / ema concentrations
table  <dig> shows the results of experiments conducted with viruses ) to optimize a specific procedure based on dye treatment for selective detection of the viral rna from infectious viruses using rt-qpcr assays a.

quantification by rt-qpcr assays a after monoazide treatment of 105tcid <dig> of rv ,  <dig> tcid <dig> of rv  and 6×  <dig> pfu of hav, infectious or inactivated at 80°c for 10 minutes. mean values ± sd .

as the first step in exploring the potential of pma and ema to detect infectious viruses, hav, rv  and rv  viruses were either inactivated thermally or not, and were subjected to dye concentrations ranged from  <dig> to 100 μm, photoactivation, rna extraction and quantification by rt-qpcr . the presence of pma or ema had no effect on detection of the rna extracted from infectious hav regardless of the concentration tested. similarly, quantification of rna extracted from pma-treated infectious rv was not strongly affected by decreases ranging from -  <dig>  log <dig> to -  <dig>  log <dig> for wa and from -  <dig>  log <dig> to -  <dig>  log <dig> for sa <dig>  depending on the pma concentrations tested. however, quantification of rna extracted from infectious rv was more strongly affected by ema treatment, with a decrease between -  <dig>  log <dig> and -  <dig>  log <dig> for wa and between -  <dig>  log <dig> and -  <dig>  log <dig> for sa <dig>  depending on the ema concentrations tested.

when thermally inactivated viruses were assayed with pma rt-qpcr, maximum decreases were found for hav  and for rv   with pma concentrations ranging from 50 μm to 100 μm, and for rv   with pma concentrations of 75 μm and 100 μm. when inactivated viruses were assayed with ema rt-qpcr, maximum decreases were found for hav  with ema at 20 μm, for rv   with ema at 20 μm, and for rv   with ema at 50 μm.

the data obtained with all the negative controls were as expected. treatment by pma / ema without photoactivation or with a single exposure of the viruses to light before rna extraction did not significantly affect the rt-qpcr detection of extracted rna .

the most effective dye concentration for each virus was experimentally chosen by taking into account the effect of the dye concentrations on the inactivated and infectious viruses. in cases where similar data were observed with different dye concentrations, the lowest dye concentration was preferred. thus, 20 μm of ema for all viruses, 50 μm of pma for hav and rv  and 75 μm of pma for rv  were selected as optimal concentrations.

evaluation of pre-treatments combining dye and surfactant
as a second step, triton x- <dig>  tween  <dig> and igepal ca- <dig>  three widely used nonionic surfactants, were tested for their efficacy in improving the effects of pma / ema treatment on viral particles .

quantification by rt-qpcr assays a after monoazide treatment combined with surfactants  of  <dig> tcid <dig> of rv ,  <dig> tcid <dig> of rv  and 6×  <dig> pfu of hav, infectious or inactivated at 80°c for 10 minutes, and titration by cell culture of 6×  <dig> pfu of infectious hav treated with surfactants. mean values ± sd .

beforehand, we attempted to evaluate surfactant toxicity towards the infectivity of hav and rotavirus strains, which would preclude their use as a discriminatory treatment. one set of hav viral samples receiving surfactants was compared to untreated hav viral samples by titration with cell culture. none of the surfactant treatments significantly reduced the initial hav titer , which argues in favor of the use of a dye-surfactant pre-treatment. it was not possible to measure the toxicity of surfactants to rv strains  because all surfactant doses affected the ma <dig> cells in culture .

the previously selected optimal dye concentration for each virus  and 75 μm of pma for rv ) were tested in association with three concentrations of three surfactants.

when inactivated hav was assayed, tween  <dig> only very slightly increased the efficacy of pma   and did not increase the efficacy of ema  pretreatments. the pretreatments of inactivated hav associating pma  with igepal ca- <dig> or triton × <dig> improved the processing regardless of the concentration of surfactant tested. indeed, the logarithmic reductions of rna detected by rt-qpcr were included between -  <dig>  log <dig> and -  <dig>  log <dig> which was higher than the reduction of  <dig>  log <dig> obtained with pma treatment at 50 μm. similarly, the processing of inactivated hav associating ema  with igepal ca- <dig> or triton × <dig>  regardless of the concentration of surfactant tested, enhanced the efficacy of the processing. indeed, the logarithmic reductions of rna detected by rt-qpcr were included between -  <dig>  log <dig> and -  <dig>  log <dig> which was higher than the reduction of  <dig>  log <dig> obtained with ema treatment at 20 μm. finally, the treatment of hav by the most promising igepal ca- <dig>  without monoazide or photoactivation before rna extraction did not affect rt-qpcr detection of extracted rna, which argues in favor of the use of a dye-surfactant pre-treatment .

when inactivated rv  was assayed, the efficacy of the processing with pma  was always slightly higher without surfactant. when inactivated rv  was assayed with ema and surfactants, the highest improvement was found with tween  <dig>  leading to an increase of reduction of rna detected by rt-qpcr of − <dig>  log <dig> compared with treatment with ema at 20 μm. however, the pre-treatment based on ema also seemed to affect rna detection from infectious rv   more than the pre-treatment based on pma . when inactivated rv  was assayed, none of the tested surfactants increased the efficacy of the dye pretreatments.

by taking into account all these data, we selected pre-treatments with ema  and igepal ca- <dig>  for hav, with ema  for rv  and pma  for rv  for their high efficiencies. since different incubation times  did not change the selected pre-treatment efficiencies , an incubation time of 2 h was selected for the following studies.

kinetic thermal viral inactivation curves and impact of rt-qpcr assays
the heat sensitivity of hav and rv  at four temperatures  was analyzed by kinetic evaluation of the loss of infectivity in cell culture compared with the loss of genomic titer in rt-qpcr assays with or without pre-treatment. stable secondary structures may facilitate the covalent binding of pma / ema to viral rna rendering the rna undetectable by rt-qpcr. moreover, amplicon length may influence the effectiveness of these assays. three rt-qpcr assays were assayed for each viral target to explore the impact of the amplified genomic region on the success of the pre-treatment-rt-qpcr assays in detecting the infectious viruses. the log <dig> reduction detection limits of the cell culture technique were − <dig> log <dig> pfu of hav, - <dig>  log <dig> tcid <dig> of rv  and − <dig>  log <dig> tcid <dig> of rv . for describing all the inactivation curves, the log-linear + tail model was found to be the most appropriate. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the values of the parameters of equation  that characterized the fate of the hav and rv strain levels respectively according to the four different temperatures, and to the three methods of quantification of the virus titer, i.e. rt-qpcr and pre-treatment rt-qpcr depending on the three different rt-qpcr assays used and the infectious titer.

for hav, the values of si, <dig> were not different from zero, which means that the ema igepal ca- <dig> treatment did not affect virus quantification with regard to the rt-qpcr method. at 37°c, the level of hav remained constant regardless of the method used. for other temperatures, kmax, which is the inactivation rate, increased with temperature. using a bigelow-type model, relating d-value to temperature, this increase corresponds to z-values ranging from 17°c to 22°c for ema-igepal ca- <dig> -rt-qpcr and infectious titration methods and of 44°c for the rt-qpcr method, regardless of the rt-qpcr assay. confidence intervals of si,res indicate that the fraction of virus that can survive thermal treatment differs depending on the titration method used and the temperature. with ema-igepal ca- <dig> - rt-qpcr and rt-qpcr assay c, the s <dig> res value is approximately − <dig>  log <dig>  which means that  <dig> virus out of  <dig> is quantifiable after 20 min of treatment regardless of the temperature. with ema-igepal ca- <dig> - rt-qpcr and rt-qpcr assay a or b, between  <dig> virus out  <dig> and  <dig> virus out of  <dig> is still quantifiable after treatment at 68°c and 80°c . for rt-qpcr, s <dig> res are much higher than s <dig> res, but the difference between rt-qpcr assays a and b and rt-qpcr assay c was also observed for rt-qpcr. for the infectious titration method, s <dig> res is around − <dig>  log <dig>  close to the values obtained with ema-igepal ca- <dig> - rt-qpcr associated with rt-qpcr assays a and b.

for rv strains, the values of s <dig>  were lower than zero, which means that the ema / pma treatment affected virus quantification with regard to the rt-qpcr method. indeed, the reduction of the concentration of infectious virus due to the monoazide pre-treatment was about of − <dig>  log <dig> by using rt-qpcr assay a and is ranged from − <dig>  log <dig> to − <dig>  log <dig> by using rt-qpcr assays b and c. these reduction levels were the same for both rv strains. at 37°c, the level of rv strains remained constant regardless of the method used. at 68°c, 72°c, and 80°c, the genomic titer of the rv strains was found to be constant by using the rt-qpcr method regardless of the rt-qpcr assay tested. the si,res confidence intervals indicate that the fraction of virus that can survive thermal treatment differs depending on the titration method used.

for the wa rv strain, with ema-rt-qpcr and rt-qpcr assay a, the s <dig> res value was approximately − <dig>  log <dig> which means  <dig> virus out of  <dig> was quantifiable after 20 min of treatment regardless of the temperature. with ema-rt-qpcr and rt-qpcr assays b or c, between  <dig> virus out of  <dig> and  <dig> virus out of  <dig>  was still quantifiable after treatment at 68°c, 72°c or 80°c . the s <dig> res values obtained with the infectious titration method were similar to the s <dig> res values of rt-qpcr assays b and c.

for the sa <dig> rv strain, with pma-rt-qpcr and rt-qpcr assay a, s <dig> res value is approximately − <dig>  log <dig>  with rt-qpcr assays b and c, s <dig> res ranged from − <dig>  log <dig> and − <dig>  log <dig>  the value of s <dig> res with these rt-qpcr assays decreased significantly when the temperature of treatment increases. s <dig> res values cannot be estimated as inactivation after 1 minute of treatment for 68°c, 72°c or 80°c was higher than the loq.

for sa <dig>  the kmax value increased with the temperature. using a bigelow-type model, this increase corresponds to z-values ranging from 15°c to 19°c according to the rt-qpcr assays for the pma-rt-qpcr method and of 28°c for the infectious titration method. for the wa strain and ema-rt-qpcr, the large confidence interval observed for kmax did not make it possible to detect a temperature effect. very fast inactivation of wa strain, ) only allows to argue that kmax values were higher than  <dig> 

in conclusion, assays conducted to examine the efficiency of pre-treatment rt-qpcr in minimizing detection signals from thermally-inactivated viruses were dependent on virus species, on the temperature of inactivation and on the rt-qpcr assays.


discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS

foodborne viruses have emerged as a major cause of outbreaks worldwide. among the factors that affect virus survival, temperature has a great influence on virus stability in food as in any other matrix. therefore, food industries widely apply temperature as a virus-inactivating factor. natural or added constituents of food and the virus species may influence the rate of virus inactivation by temperature but higher temperatures provided more pronounced virus decay  <cit> . the primary model that was found to effectively describe thermal virus inactivation in our study, , was similar to the one chosen to describe thermal inactivation of hav in raspberries  <cit> . the infectivity of enteric viruses requires the functional integrity of two major components, the capsid and the genome  <cit> . while quantitative rt-pcr is a specific and sensitive tool for determining the quantities of viral genomes in the environment and food samples, it does not discriminate between infectious viruses and non-infectious viruses that do not pose a threat to health. moreover, the virus genome was shown to be more resistant than the infectious virus. so, methods which provide information about the infectivity are particularly useful for the detection of enteric viruses and would be an advantage in a public health perspective  <cit> .

recently, ethidium monoazide  and propidium monoazide , which are intercalating dyes, have been used combined with pcr or real-time pcr for the selective detection of viable microorganisms. in this study, monoazides were tested in association with surfactants in order to develop a technique for determining the residual infectivity of thermally inactivated enteric viruses. these assays are based on the penetration of monoazide, potentially facilitated by the action of surfactants, through damaged or compromised capsids and its covalent binding to viral rna, which makes the genome unavailable for amplification by rt-qpcr.

in this study, it was hypothesized that the pma / ema would be able to enter non-infectious rv / hav viruses and easily bind to the dsrna of rv and to the highly structured 5’-non coding region  of hav ssrna targeted by the rt-qpcr assays  <cit> . the pre-treatment rt-qpcr assays with the shortest amplification fragments for rv  and hav  did not produce data similar to those obtained by measuring the decrease in the number of infectious particles following heat treatment. by using both longer amplification fragments  targeting two different regions of rv dsrna, data obtained with pretreatment rt-qpcr were very similar suggesting that the targeted region had not influenced the success of the pretreatment rt-qpcr for dsrna. similarly, both longer amplification regions for hav ssrna  provided data suggesting that the stable secondary structures may facilitate covalent binding of monoazide to hav ssrna. thus, the stable secondary structures may facilitate covalent binding of monoazide to viral rna, rendering the rna undetectable by rt-qpcr. besides the targeted genome region, this study also showed the influence of the rt-qpcr assays in terms of length of amplicons for three viruses. other studies have shown the influence of amplification length on the degree of pcr suppression by monoazide treatment in dead cells  <cit> .

the hav capsid is composed of the structural proteins vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig>  and possibly vp <dig>  encoded in the p <dig> region of the genome  <cit> . cell culture-derived rotavirus preparations contain a mixture of double-layered particles  and triple-layered particles . the innermost layer of the rotavirus particle is made up of the core protein vp <dig>  the middle layer is composed entirely of vp <dig>  and the outermost layer of rv is composed of two proteins, vp <dig> and vp <dig>  <cit> . vp <dig> forms spikes that extend outwards from the surface of the virus and which have been linked to a variety of functions, including initial attachment of the virus to the cell membrane and penetration into the cell by the virion  <cit> . indeed, the capsids structures may explain the differences of efficacy of thermal inactivation and of the penetration of monoazide. the presence of monoazide did not affect the measurement of hav, but it slightly affected the measurement of both rotavirus strains. this effect appeared to be variable  depending on the rt-qpcr assays and therefore not always an impediment to the use of monoazide pre-treatment for rv. nevertheless, this monoazide effect seems to be dependent on the virus type and should be evaluated to develop this approach with other viruses.

there is still very little development of monoazide rt-qpcr methods for determining the infectiosity of enteric viruses. among the few studies reported in the literature, sánchez et al.  <cit>  found that pma treatment at 50 μm was significantly more effective than rnase treatment for differentiating infectious and thermally-inactivated hav , with hav titers reduced by more than  <dig>  log <dig>  the ema – igepal ca- <dig> - rt-qpcr assay developed in this study was significantly more effective for differentiating infectious and thermally-inactivated hav with hav titers reduced by more than  <dig> log <dig> and  <dig>  log <dig> respectively with the rt-qpcr assays a and b after 5 min at 80°c. z values observed in the present study when infectious titration or pretreatment-rt-qpcr methods were used are consistent with those observed in the meta-analysis of inactivation of enteric viruses in food and water carried out by bertrand et al.  <cit> . nevertheless, when high inactivation temperatures were applied, clearer discriminations between infectious and non-infectious viruses were consistently observed with pre-treatment-rt-qpcr assays. thus, the procedures reported in the present study provide limits that are comparable to those determined by others  <cit> . as the pre-enzymatic treatment-pcr approach, monoazide rt-qpcr depend mainly on capsid integrity as the criterion for infectivity, and this could be one of the drawbacks of this technique since virus inactivation may take place by other means than particle disruption  <cit> .

optimization of ema or pma concentration and the choice of the rt-qpcr assay, as well as the addition of a complementary treatment to enhance the penetration of monoazide into the slightly-damaged capsid may lead to more effective monoazide treatment. this study showed that surfactants may be useful to improve monoazide-rt-qpcr assays for hav but not for rv.

in conclusion, the lack of information about infectious risk makes it necessary to evaluate new means of preventing a positive rt-qpcr signal in the absence of infectious virus. the pre-treatment of enteric viruses with monoazide alone or in conjunction with other capsid-disrupting aids prior to rt-qpcr may be optimized to obtain rapid differentiation between infectious and non-infectious viruses. this approach can potentially be used with all non-culturable and difficult to culture viruses but must be estimated with regard to the specific conditions of inactivation. currently, it seems relevant to develop this approach for the identification of infectious viruses in food and environmental samples. however the potential multiple sources of inactivation, such as uvs, storing conditions, temperature, etc., could lead to changes in capsid protein conformation without compromising capsid integrity  <cit> . this is why it may be necessary to adapt and evaluate the dye treatment according to the inactivation type. moreover, the efficacy of pre-treatment rt-qpcr assays could be affected by the types of samples  and should be characterized in order to be developed further. therefore, this new approach could be very useful for evaluating the susceptibility of non-culturable enteric viruses  to specific inactivation / disinfection techniques or food processing strategies and could be an alternative to studies using culturable surrogate viruses that differ in structure, function and comportment.
