BACKGROUND
the mutation responsible for the callipyge trait is located within an imprinted gene cluster on the distal end of ovine chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the callipyge phenotype is associated with an altered carcass composition including a 30–40% increase in muscle mass, a 6–7% decrease in carcass fat, decreased organ weights, and a more compact skeleton, all without a net affect on animal growth  <cit> . there is a pronounced hypertrophy of muscles in the loin and pelvic limbs and a lesser degree of hypertrophy in muscles of the thoracic limbs  <cit> . the callipyge phenotype is inherited in a non-mendelian mode termed polar overdominance  <cit>  in which only animals that inherit a normal allele  from the dam and the mutant callipyge allele from the sire  exhibit the callipyge phenotype. maternal heterozygotes  and callipyge allele homozygotes  have muscling and carcass compositions that are similar to normal sheep .

a physical contig spanning the region containing the callipyge mutation was constructed using overlapping ovine bacterial artificial chromosomes  <cit>  and  <dig> kb of sequence was obtained from the contig  <cit> . comparisons of the ovine sequence to the human genome sequence and to expressed sequence databases indicated the presence of at least six transcribed genes with allele-specific expression  <cit>  . the gene order along the contig was found to be delta-like  <dig> , dlk associated transcript , gene-trap locus  <dig> , paternal expressed gene  <dig>  and maternal expressed gene  <dig> . the same conserved gene order was also found as an imprinted domain on human chromosome  <dig> and mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the dlk <dig> locus  encodes a transmembrane protein that contains epidermal-growth factor repeats  <cit> . cleavage of the extracellular domain of dlk <dig> produces the circulating protein fetal antigen- <dig>  <cit> . dat is a short non-coding rna that has been proposed to be a cleavage product of extended dlk <dig> transcripts  <cit> . both dlk1and dat are expressed from the paternal allele  <cit> . gtl <dig>  and meg <dig> genes express non-coding rna from the maternal allele  <cit> . the peg <dig> gene contains an intronless open reading frame of  <dig> amino acids in sheep  <cit> . the human and mouse orthologues known as retrotransposon-like  <dig>  encode  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. rna transcripts were detected from the opposite strand of the same gene, referred to as peg11as   <cit> . in the mouse, two maternally expressed micrornas have been identified with perfect complementarity to mouse rtl <dig>  <cit> .

the causative mutation for callipyge is a single base transition of a  to g  in the intergenic region located between dlk <dig> and gtl <dig>  <cit>  . this mutation has been shown to be 100% concordant with all animals of the +mat/clpgpat genotype based on haplotype analysis  <cit> . analysis of sheep from  <dig> different breeds as well as  <dig> mammalian species revealed a highly conserved  <dig> base sequence that includes the single nucleotide polymorphism  <cit> . the g polymorphism is unique to direct descendents of the first known callipyge animal, a ram named "solid gold". this animal was mosaic for the mutation  <cit> , providing strong evidence that this single nucleotide polymorphism is the causative mutation. initial results indicate that the mutation alters the expression of several of the genes within the imprinted cluster  <cit>  when they are inherited in cis without altering their parent-of-origin-specific expression  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed the expression of five genes within the callipyge cluster in the muscles of lambs of all four genotypes. quantitative analysis of gene expression using a series of orthogonal contrasts showed that dlk <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig> exhibited a polar overdominant pattern of gene expression. the expression of peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts in the muscles of paternal heterozygous callipyge lambs  was different from the other three genotypes. a sense/antisense interaction of peg <dig> and peg11as, such as an rna interference mechanism, would be consistent with a trans interaction between reciprocally imprinted genes that has been previously proposed as a mechanism for polar overdominance  <cit> .

RESULTS
northern blot analysis
muscle samples were collected from 12- and 8-week-old lambs, when muscle hypertrophy is well established in animals with the callipyge phenotype. total rna was extracted from three muscles that undergo hypertrophy including longissimus dorsi , semimembranosus, and gluteus medius , and one muscle that does not undergo hypertrophy, the supraspinatus, . strand specific probes were used to analyze peg <dig> and peg11as expression. hybridization of longissimus dorsi, semimembranosus and gluteus medius northern blots with a peg <dig> probe indicated expression of a  <dig>  kb peg <dig> transcript in paternal heterozygotes  that was not readily detectable in the other three genotypes . two smaller peg11as transcripts of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were detected in the two genotypes with maternally inherited callipyge alleles  by a probe from the complementary strand. peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts were not detected in the supraspinatus. the expression of dlk <dig> was detectable at various levels in each of the four muscles and all four genotypes, although dlk <dig> appeared to be up-regulated in the loin and pelvic limb muscles of +mat/clpgpat and clpgmat/clpgpat animals . gtl <dig> transcripts of around  <dig>  kb were evident in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes. a distinct  <dig>  kb gtl <dig> transcript was consistently detected in the +mat/clpgpat genotype and no gtl <dig> transcripts were detected in the +/+ genotype. a  <dig>  kb meg <dig> transcript was expressed to a lesser degree than gtl <dig> in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes and was also detectable in the +mat/clpgpat genotype. the expression pattern of meg <dig> was the least consistent in the northern blot analysis of individuals of the four genotypes.

peg11/peg11as
ribonuclease protection assays were performed using five riboprobes to map the peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts to the contig sequence . the results for riboprobe p confirm the expression of peg <dig> transcripts in the gluteus medius of +mat/clpgpat animals and showed a very low level of peg <dig> in the gluteus medius of clpgmat/clpgpat animals. peg11as transcripts were readily detectable in animals of the +/+, clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat genotypes but were slightly above background levels in the +mat/clpgpat animals . two other peg <dig> probes from the open reading frame  and from the 3'utr  showed equivalent results to riboprobe p in the gluteus medius . the same expression pattern was seen for peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts in the supraspinatus, but signal from the protected riboprobes was just above background level.

two probes from upstream of the peg <dig> coding sequence  did not detect any peg <dig> transcripts, indicating that transcription of the  <dig>  kb peg <dig> was initiated within  <dig> bp of the start codon of the open reading frame. riboprobe f detected peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of all four genotypes, with the lowest expression in the paternal heterozygous  animals. the peg11as riboprobe g shows three protected fragments, suggesting variable splice junctions or transcription termination sites for peg11as transcripts.

quantitative analysis of the effect of genotype on gene expression
gene expression was measured in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of  <dig> week-old animals  using quantitative pcr. the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not significantly different across the four genotypes in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus , indicating that equivalent amounts of rna were used for cdna synthesis and quantitative pcr. the effect of the callipyge mutation on genotype-specific expression of dlk <dig> and peg <dig> in gluteus medius was the same  although the magnitude of the response was greater for peg <dig> than dlk <dig> . the paternal heterozygous  animals had the highest transcript abundance , followed by clpgmat/clpgpat animals, which had significantly greater transcript abundance  than clpgmat/+pat or +/+ animals. the mrna abundance of dlk <dig> in the gluteus medius was 6-fold and  <dig> -fold greater in +mat/clpgpat lambs and clpgmat/clpgpat lambs respectively, relative to normal lambs . peg <dig> mrna abundance in the gluteus medius was 200-fold and 13-fold greater in +mat/clpgpat lambs and clpgmat/clpgpat lambs respectively, relative to normal lambs .

the effect of the callipyge mutation on dlk <dig> and peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus was different . no differences in dlk <dig> transcript abundance in the supraspinatus were found among the four genotypes . although not statistically analyzed, the level of dlk <dig> expression was similar between the gluteus medius and supraspinatus . peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus had a different genotype-specific pattern than in the gluteus medius. peg <dig> expression was elevated 150-fold in +mat/clpgpat animals  but was not significantly changed in the other three genotypes . the transcript abundance of peg <dig> in supraspinatus was generally much lower than in gluteus medius of the same genotype. peg <dig> expression in the supraspinatus was 12-fold lower than in the gluteus medius of paternal heterozygous animals .

maternal inheritance of the callipyge allele significantly altered the expression of meg <dig> but not peg11as in the gluteus medius . transcript abundance of meg <dig> in gluteus medius was 6-fold greater  in the clpgmat/+pat and clpgmat/clpgpat animals relative to the +mat/clpgpat and +/+ animals . expression of meg <dig> in the supraspinatus was also affected by the callipyge mutation but to a lesser degree . the homozygous callipyge animals had significantly higher meg <dig> transcript abundance than paternal heterozygotes, but those two genotypes were not significantly different from maternal heterozygotes and homozygous wild type lambs.

orthogonal contrasts were used to analyze different models of gene action for the genes that had a significant effect for genotype . the polar overdominance contrast was significant for transcript abundances of dlk <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig> in gluteus medius and for peg <dig> and meg <dig> in the supraspinatus. the additive contrasts were also significant for dlk <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig> in gluteus medius but were only significant for peg <dig> in supraspinatus. the maternal dominance contrast was significant for dlk <dig> and peg <dig> gluteus medius.

discussion
our results show a clear pattern of increased expression for genes within the imprinted callipyge cluster in muscles that become hypertrophied, whereas expression of these genes was either reduced or absent in a muscle that does not become hypertrophied. the increased gene expression occurred when the mutation was inherited in cis and was dependent on each gene's imprinting status, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that the mutation has disrupted a long range control element  <cit> . two paternally expressed genes, dlk <dig> and peg <dig>  had significantly increased transcript abundance when a callipyge allele was inherited from the sire. one maternally expressed gene, meg <dig>  showed significantly increased transcript abundance when the callipyge allele was inherited from the dam. the changes in gene expression were sustained until  <dig> weeks of age, when the differences in growth and body composition between callipyge and normal lamb are established and are subsequently maintained  <cit> .

northern blot analysis suggests that expression of gtl <dig> and peg11as was increased by maternal inheritance of the callipyge allele. quantitative analysis was not done for gtl <dig> in this study due to the expression of numerous alternatively spliced transcripts that have been reported for mice and sheep  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb gtl <dig> mrna seen in this study consisted of a heterogeneous population of alternatively spliced mrnas. similarly, two peg11as transcripts were detected over a  <dig>  kb area extending from beyond the 5' end of the peg <dig> transcript to the 3'utr. the  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb peg11as transcripts detected by northern blot analysis using probe p would not be protected by probes c or g unless the peg11as transcripts undergo intron splicing or there are other transcripts that were not detected in the northern blots. therefore, the effect of the callipyge mutation on gtl <dig> and peg11as will require a more extensive analysis to fully elucidate their expression patterns in the four genotypes and determine their role in the callipyge model.

due to their paternal allele-specific expression, the dlk <dig> and peg <dig> genes are both candidates for an effector gene that is responsible for the skeletal muscle hypertrophy exhibited by paternal heterozygous  animals. in this study, both genes showed a polar overdominant expression pattern in that paternal heterozygotes had significantly higher levels of gene expression than the other three genotypes. the major differences between dlk <dig> and peg <dig> were the magnitude and the muscle specificity of the up-regulation. dlk <dig> was readily detectable in all muscles and genotypes by northern blot, but the up-regulation in paternal heterozygous animals was restricted to muscles of the loin and pelvic limb. the quantitative results showed a 6-fold increase in dlk <dig> transcript abundance in the gluteus medius and no change of dlk <dig> abundance in the supraspinatus. this pattern of gene expression is consistent with studies on individual muscle growth that show significant muscle hypertrophy in the gluteus medius but not in the supraspinatus  <cit> . dlk <dig> transcripts were significantly increased  in the gluteus medius of clpgmat/clpgpat animals, which do not exhibit muscle hypertrophy. the lack of a phenotype in clpgmat/clpgpat animals could be due to a threshold effect that requires more than a  <dig> -fold increase in dlk <dig> transcript abundance to change muscle growth.

the expression of peg <dig> was very low in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus of normal sheep and was induced in both muscles of callipyge lambs. northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay and quantitative pcr results all show that the expression of peg <dig> and peg11as transcripts was much lower in the supraspinatus than the other muscles. the high level of expression of peg <dig> in the gluteus medius relative to the supraspinatus of callipyge lambs indicates that peg <dig> could also be the gene responsible for muscle hypertrophy if there is a threshold level required to change muscle growth. the peg <dig> gene has a long intronless open reading frame but it is not known if a protein is produced or what function it may have.

the overdominant nature of the callipyge phenotype through the lack of muscle hypertrophy in animals with the clpgmat/clpgpat genotype is one of the more intriguing aspects of the trait and has led to a hypothesis of trans effects by other reciprocally imprinted genes in the callipyge region  <cit> . if the peg <dig> gene has a direct role in muscle hypertrophy, either alone or in concert with dlk <dig>  then peg11as may have a role in a trans effect on peg <dig> expression. in +mat/clpgpat animals, peg <dig> transcripts were 14-fold and 4-fold more abundant than peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius and supraspinatus respectively. peg11as transcripts were more abundant than peg <dig> transcripts in the other three genotypes for both muscles. therefore, the relative abundance of peg <dig> transcripts to peg11as transcripts was unique in paternal heterozygous animals. micrornas are a central component of rna interference mechanisms. in the mouse, two antisense microrna have been identified for the orthologous rtl <dig> locus  <cit> . rna interference mechanisms have been shown both to repress transcription by inducing heterochromatin formation  <cit>  and to cause post-transcriptional silencing through nuclear retention or targeted degradation  <cit> . micrornas may be produced from post-transcriptional processing of peg11as rna and be involved in normal regulation of the locus and in generating overdominance  <cit> . expression of peg11as may normally cause repression of the paternal peg <dig> locus since very little peg <dig> mrna was detectable in the muscles of normal animals. in the animals with a paternally inherited callipyge allele, , the normal repression of the peg <dig> locus has been disrupted by the mutation in a putative long range control element  <cit> . peg <dig> transcripts only accumulate in significant excess of peg11as in the paternal heterozygous animals, whereas in the clpgmat/clpgpat animals the peg11as transcripts remain in excess and may prevent the accumulation of the threshold level of peg <dig> mrna required to produce a muscle hypertrophy phenotype. although the expression of peg11as was not affected by genotype in quantitative pcr, the northern blots and transcript mapping indicate there are multiple transcripts that are likely to undergo different intron splicing. further analysis of peg11as expression will be necessary to determine its role in the peg <dig> locus regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the effect of the callipyge mutation has been to increase transcript abundance of four genes, dlk <dig>  gtl <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig>  within the imprinted cluster in skeletal muscles that become hypertrophied. the increase in transcript abundance was consistent with each gene's parental allele-specific expression. the dlk <dig> and peg <dig> genes were both expressed at their highest levels in paternal heterozygous animals and exhibited polar overdominant gene expression patterns. therefore, both genes are candidates for causing muscle hypertrophy. dlk <dig> expression was only elevated in muscles that undergo hypertrophy, so its muscle-specific increase was consistent with the callipyge phenotype. peg <dig> was 12-fold more abundant in hypertrophied muscle than non-hypertrophied muscle and only paternal heterozygous animals had peg <dig> transcript levels in excess of peg11as transcript levels. the unique relationship of peg <dig> and peg11as in paternal heterozygous animals suggests that an rna interference mechanism may have a role in regulating the peg <dig> locus and polar overdominance in callipyge sheep.
