BACKGROUND
the sec6/ <dig> complex, or 'exocyst', is an octomeric protein complex thought to comprise the proteins sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  exo <dig> and exo <dig>  this complex has been most extensively studied in yeast, where it is required for membrane trafficking and secretion  <cit> . in multicellular organisms, sec proteins are expressed at particularly high levels in the nervous system  <cit> . the functional role of sec proteins in neurons, however, including whether they always function as a canonical octomeric complex, remains unclear.

we identified sec <dig> mutants in an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutations causing defects in development of glutamatergic drosophila neuromuscular junctions   <cit> . sec <dig> is a core member of the sec 6/ <dig> complex. alone or as a member of that complex, sec <dig> has been suggested to play a role in several aspects of neural development and function, including:  neurite outgrowth  <cit> ,  calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion  <cit> ,  trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors  <cit>  and  regulation of neuronal microtubule assembly  <cit> .

a mouse sec <dig> knockout has been created, but dies early in embryonic development  <cit> , precluding significant functional or developmental analyses. in contrast, the drosophila sec <dig> knockouts described here survive through embryogenesis, and hypomorphs survive throughout larval development into pupation. this provides the first opportunity to describe a sec <dig> mutant phenotype at any synapse. the drosophila nmj is a particularly good model synapse for this purpose, since it is glutamatergic and accessible to powerful microscopic and electrophysiological techniques throughout development. here, we provide the first description of sec <dig> mutant synaptic phenotypes. we focused our analysis on  growth of presynaptic terminals,  basal neurotransmission,  ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking and  microtubule density, since sec <dig> has specifically been implicated in each of these processes.

we found that sec <dig> mutant nmjs show no obvious defect in growth of presynaptic arborizations or neurotransmitter secretion, but do show mild defects in glutamate receptor trafficking and relatively dramatic alterations in synaptic microtubule density. we hypothesize that sec8's most important role in vivo is spatially-restricted inhibition of microtubule stability, and that disruption of microtubule regulation may underlie most, if not all, sec <dig> mutant phenotypes.

RESULTS
identification and generation of sec <dig> mutants
we identified the transposon insertion mutant p{supor-p}cg2095kg <dig> in simultaneous unbiased forward screens for drosophila mutants with alterations in nmj presynaptic growth and glutamate receptor cluster formation  <cit> . we selected this mutant for further study on the basis of a dramatic semi-penetrant presynaptic overgrowth phenotype and reproducible loss of glutamate receptor immunoreactivity . the kg <dig> p-element insertion was mapped by the berkeley drosophila genome project using inverse pcr to the first exon of predicted gene cg <dig>  <cit> . we confirmed the kg <dig> p-element insertion site in cg <dig> by site-specific pcr primers.

we cloned and sequenced full-length cg <dig> cdna from the wild-type drosophila strain oregon r . a blast search using this oregon r cg <dig> amino acid sequence showed 33% identity to rat and human sec <dig> . conversely, blast searches using mammalian sec <dig> against the translated drosophila genome showed close matches only to cg <dig>  thus, cg <dig> represents the sole drosophila sec <dig> homolog. hereafter, we refer to cg <dig> as sec <dig> 

because the p{supor-p}cg2095kg <dig> p element insertion mutant represents a mutation in the drosophila sec <dig> gene, we refer to this allele as 'sec8p1'. we verified that the p-element insertion was responsible for the sec8p <dig> phenotype  by complementation analysis and remobilization of the p-element  <cit>  to create precise excisions . these revertants are phenotypically indistinguishable from other control  animals. furthermore, sec8p <dig> mutants retain their phenotype in trans to a deficiency, dftpl <dig>  that completely eliminates the cg <dig> gene. these results show that the sec8p <dig> phenotype is specifically due to the p-element insertion in sec <dig> 

many transposon insertion mutants, including the sec8p <dig> mutants, represent hypomorphic alleles. therefore, we generated deletions of the sec <dig> gene via imprecise excision of the kg <dig> p-element in sec8p <dig>  using standard methods  <cit> . among the excision mutants isolated was a cg2095-specific deletion that we refer to as 'sec8Δ1'. to confirm that sec8Δ <dig> only disrupts the sec <dig> gene and provide an accurate molecular description of this mutation, we sequenced the sec <dig> genomic region in sec8Δ <dig> mutants. sequencing showed that the sec8Δ <dig> deletion begins before the atg,  <dig> bp into the first 5' exon, and ends  <dig> bp prior to the 3' end of the last exon. neighboring genes are completely intact. sec8Δ <dig> therefore represents a zygotic null. sec8Δ <dig> homozygous mutants hatch at the same time as controls , but do not undergo their first molt and die as first instar larvae . the molecular nature of the sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> mutations is summarized in fig. 1b.

homozygous sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> mutants both hatched at approximately normal time  and appeared grossly normal by light microscopy . there was no obvious difference in mutant animal size, behavior or viability immediately after hatching. however, homozygous sec8Δ <dig> mutants did not undergo their first molt and did not live past first instar larval stage . homozygous sec8p <dig> mutants appeared to molt and pupate normally, and therefore lived through larval development, but did not eclose and therefore died as pupae. in view of the viability and the fact that sec <dig> is almost completely deleted in sec8Δ <dig> mutants, we conclude that sec8p <dig> represents a hypomorphic allele, while sec8Δ <dig> represents a zygotic null allele.

drosophila sec <dig> is abundant in embryonic and larval neuromuscular junctions 
the drosophila embryonic/larval neuromuscular junction  is a well-established model glutamatergic synapse that can be used to examine the effects of sec <dig> loss on synaptic development and function. to test whether sec <dig> is expressed at the nmj, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against sec <dig> using a synthetic peptide composed of sec <dig> amino acids 440– <dig>  and affinity purified these antibodies using the original peptide epitope. immunoreactivity of this antibody was widely distributed throughout many tissues and was particularly enriched in synapses, including the nmj . because the pre and postsynaptic membranes are separated by only approximately  <dig> nm  <cit> , it is impossible to distinguish definitively by light microscopy whether sec <dig> immunoreactivity directly at the nmj is pre or postsynaptic. nevertheless, several indications suggest that sec <dig> is both pre and postsynaptic. first, there is clearly sec <dig> immunoreactivity throughout the muscle cell outside the area delimited by presynaptic hrp staining; therefore, sec <dig> must be expressed in the postsynaptic muscle cell. postsynaptic localization of sec <dig> is also suggested by the fact that sec <dig> immunoreactivity overlaps immunoreactivity for the postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit gluriia. three-dimensional reconstructions and rotations  show sec <dig> immunoreactivity extending above the interior face of the muscle, consistent with presynaptic localization. we did not observe any sec <dig> immunoreactivity in segmental nerve axons, suggesting that presynaptic sec <dig>  if present, must be localized specifically at the terminals, but there is little or no immunoreactivity in the centers of presynaptic boutons. thus, presynaptic sec <dig> must be localized specifically near the terminal membrane. we obtained essentially identical results using a recently described and independently generated antibody  <cit>  .

sec <dig> antibody immunoreactivity in the embryonic/first instar  neuromusculature was dramatically reduced in homozygous sec8p <dig> mutants, and was almost undetectable in sec8Δ <dig> mutants . on immunoblots using whole-animal extracts, our sec <dig> antibody recognized a single  <dig> kda band . the intensity of this band was reduced, on average, to approximately one-half normal in both sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> l <dig> mutants . this suggests that despite the deletion of the sec <dig> gene in sec8Δ <dig> mutants, and almost complete elimination of sec <dig> in the nmj of homozygous mutants, there is substantial maternal contribution of sec <dig> in other tissues, as previously shown for other sec proteins  <cit> .

we conclude from our immunohistochemical results that sec <dig> is probably expressed both pre and postsynaptically at the drosophila nmj, and that sec <dig> mutant nmjs have almost no remaining sec <dig> but substantial maternal sec <dig> persists in other parts of the sec8Δ <dig> mutant animals.

sec <dig> mutants show increased nmj growth during larval development
sec proteins have been implicated in the membrane addition required for neurite outgrowth  <cit> . formation of drosophila larval nmjs involves extensive neurite outgrowth and presynaptic arborization. examination of motor nerve terminals in the ventral body wall neuromusculature of drosophila sec <dig> mutants therefore provides an excellent opportunity to test whether sec <dig> plays a role in nerve terminal growth in vivo. approximately halfway through drosophila embryonic development , motor neuron growth cones exit the cns and travel along the developing segmental nerve toward their body wall muscle targets. approximately  <dig> h ael, development of ventral nmjs begins when motor neuron growth cone filopodia contact the target muscles. over the next several hours, filopodia-ringed growth cones in contact with appropriate targets collapse to form nascent presynaptic processes of indistinct shape, termed 'prevaricosities'. by 17– <dig> h ael, parts of the prevaricosities begin to constrict and/or swell such that presynaptic terminals  are formed  <cit> . these presynaptic boutons are functional very early; electrophysiological analysis shows that nmj transmission occurs within minutes of contact between motor nerve axons and muscles  <cit> . at the time of hatching , presynaptic boutons are still relatively indistinct, morphologically, but nonetheless are clearly highly functional since neuromuscular transmission is required for hatching and subsequent crawling of the newly hatched first instar  larva. during larval development , the presynaptic arborization grows dramatically in order to accommodate rapidly growing larval muscles. this growth involves additions in nmj length, branches and bouton number . boutons also become more distinct during nmj development, such that the third instar nmj typically appears as 'beads on a string'  <cit> .

to examine motor nerve terminal morphology, we used fluorescently-conjugated anti-hrp antibodies , and confocal microscopy . in sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> mutants, nmj morphology appeared normal in first instar  larvae . l <dig> mutant motor nerve insertion sites appeared normal, presynaptic swelling size was appropriate for the animal age, and the arborizations were similar in number and shape to those from age-matched control animals. the number of boutons and branches in mutant l <dig> ventral longitudinal muscle 6/ <dig> nmjs were statistically unchanged compared to control animals . however, in sec8p <dig> third instar larvae , muscle 6/ <dig> nmjs showed consistent and qualitatively obvious changes in morphology and terminal number . with less penetrance, sec8p <dig> mutant third instar larvae showed dramatically abnormal neurite growth  that was never observed in control nmjs. the average number of presynaptic boutons and branches was significantly increased in sec8p <dig> mutant larvae compared to controls . homozygous sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> l <dig> mutants did not show any obvious defects in body wall muscle shape or size. muscle insertions were correct and muscles did not detach abnormally during manual dissection or subsequent treatment. we conclude from these results that loss of sec <dig> does not significantly impair growth of motor nerve terminals or presynaptic arborization. instead, surprisingly, loss of sec <dig> triggered an increase of nmj size during larval development.

sec <dig> mutants show robust neurotransmission but a slight decrease in the number of postsynaptic glutamate receptors
sec <dig> has been suggested to play a role in calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion  <cit> . to determine whether transmission in sec <dig> mutants is functionally abnormal, we used voltage clamp synaptic electrophysiology on nmjs. first we examined sec8Δ <dig> mutants, since sec <dig> was almost completely eliminated from the nmj in these animals . whole-cell patch clamp recordings from homozygous sec8Δ <dig> mutants showed that sec8Δ <dig> mutant nmjs were capable of robust endogenous synaptic transmission . this result is consistent with the fact that newly hatched sec8Δ <dig> mutant larvae appeared to crawl and feed efficiently. the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents  was normal in sec8Δ <dig> mutants . these data suggest no major disruption of presynaptic function after loss of sec <dig>  however, sejc amplitude in sec8Δ <dig> mutant first instar nmjs was mildly but significantly reduced . reduced sejc amplitude suggests loss or mislocalization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

to test glutamate receptor function directly, we pressure ejected  <dig> mm glutamate on to patch-clamped  postsynaptic muscle. pressure ejection of glutamate provides a means of measuring postsynaptic receptor function independent of presynaptic glutamate release. drosophila nmj receptors have low affinity for glutamate compared to mammalian glutamate receptors  <cit> ;  <dig> mm is barely saturating. currents triggered by pressure ejection of glutamate were significantly reduced in sec8Δ <dig> mutants compared to controls . this reduction in glutamate-gated current amplitude could be due to a decrease in the number of functional postsynaptic glutamate receptors, or a change in the biophysical properties of individual receptors. in embryonic/l <dig> drosophila, these two possibilities can be distinguished by measuring the single channel current size of synaptic receptors directly. the input resistance of embryonic/l <dig> drosophila muscle cells, coupled with the large conductance of insect muscle glutamate receptors, allows whole-cell patch clamp mode discrimination of delayed single channel closing on the falling phase of some sejcs  <cit> . the amplitude of these delayed synaptic receptor closings was not significantly different between sec8Δ <dig> mutants and controls , suggesting that the decrease in glutamate-gated current size measured in sec <dig> mutants is due to a loss of functional postsynaptic receptors, rather than a change in receptor properties. these latter experiments could not be repeated in sec8p <dig> mutant third instar larvae because synaptic receptors are not accessible for rapid agonist application because presynaptic terminals tend to be embedded deep within a subsynaptic reticulum, ssr. decreased muscle input resistance in l <dig> animals also makes it impossible to discriminate single channel current amplitudes. however, two-electrode voltage clamp recordings revealed that, as in sec8Δ <dig> mutant l <dig> animals, sejc amplitude was significantly reduced in sec8p <dig> mutant third instar larvae , consistent with loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in both mutant alleles throughout larval development.

to confirm the electrophysiological results and determine whether loss of receptors in sec <dig> mutants might be due to loss of a specific receptor subtype, we performed immunocytochemical experiments on the same synapses examined electrophysiologically . drosophila nmjs contain two spatially, pharmacologically and biophysically distinct subtypes of postsynaptic glutamate receptor  <cit> , referred to as 'a-type' and 'b-type' receptors. a and b-type receptors appear to be molecularly identical heterotetramers that differ by one subunit: a-type receptors contain the subunit gluriia, but not gluriib, and b-type receptors contain the subunit gluriib, but not gluriia. both receptor subtypes also contain the subunits gluriic , gluriid and gluriie  <cit> .

we visualized a-type glutamate receptors using an antibody against the receptor subunit gluriia. we visualized b-type receptors using an antibody against the receptor subunit gluriib. we also used an antibody against the subunit gluriic, which is shared by both glutamate receptor subtypes. at drosophila embryonic/l <dig> nmjs, glutamate receptor subunit immunoreactivity is visible as small puncta clustered under and around presynaptic terminals  <cit> . figure 5a shows embryonic nmjs double-stained using anti-hrp antibodies to visualize presynaptic nerve terminals  and anti-gluriia antibodies to visualize a-type postsynaptic glutamate receptors . in sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> mutant first instar larvae, the cluster size of both a- and b-type glutamate receptors was significantly reduced . glutamate receptor cluster sizes were also significantly reduced in sec8p <dig> mutant third instar larvae . revertant third instar larvae showed no change in glutamate receptor cluster size .

we also quantified the immunoreactivity of the presynaptic proteins cysteine string protein  and synaptotagmin , as well as the maguk protein discs-large , which is primarily localized postsynaptically. these antigens do not form distinct immunoreactive clusters. therefore, we quantified csp, syt and dlg immunoreactivity by measuring average fluorescence intensity in the nmj minus average non-nmj muscle background intensity over an identical area of neighboring muscle membrane, normalized to control genotype mutant / control). this approach avoids use of fluorescence intensity from a different wavelength as a control, which would be inappropriate because fluorescence of different fluorophores and detection of different emission spectra can vary independently from that of the 'target' fluorophore. immunoreactivity for csp, dlg, and syt was normal in both sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> . since csp and syt are critical for normal synaptic transmission  <cit> , and dlg is required for proper localization of gluriib  <cit> , normal immunoreactivity for csp, syt and dlg is consistent with relatively normal neurotransmission and gluriib clustering that we observed.

taken together, our electrophysiological and immunocytochemical results suggest that sec <dig> mutant nmjs are capable of relatively normal neurotransmission, except for a slight loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

the loss of glutamate receptors in sec <dig> mutant nmjs is due to mislocalization of glutamate receptor protein
although the loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors that we observed in sec <dig> mutants was slight, we felt this phenotype deserved further investigation since sec <dig> has been implicated in glutamate receptor trafficking, but sec8-dependent trafficking of non-nmda receptors has not been demonstrated  <cit> . drosophila nmj glutamate receptors are most similar in amino acid sequence to mammalian non-nmda kainate receptors  <cit> . the drosophila genome also encodes nmda receptor subunits, which are expressed in the cns but not in muscle  <cit> .

to determine whether the loss of postsynaptic receptors might be due to changes in receptor subunit expression, we measured glutamate receptor subunit mrna levels using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. in embryonic/l <dig> sec <dig> mutants, the relative levels of gluriia, gluriib and gluriic mrna were not reduced compared to controls , n = 7; sec8p <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; sec8Δ <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; gluriib: control =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n = 8; sec8p <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; sec8Δ <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; gluriic: control =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n = 8; sec8p <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; sec8Δ <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  a.u., n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ).

to determine whether the loss of postsynaptic receptors involved decreased glutamate receptor protein production or increased degradation, we measured total gluriia and gluriib subunit protein using immunoblots. gluriia and gluriib are thought to be expressed only in body wall muscle  <cit> . immunoblot analysis suggested a reduction in neither total gluriia nor total gluriib protein in sec <dig> mutants . this result suggests that, in sec <dig> mutants, glutamate receptor protein may be dispersed throughout the cell instead of appropriately localized in the postsynaptic membrane, where it would have been detectable immunocytochemically and electrophysiologically. these results, in combination with our electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry, are consistent with a minor role for sec <dig> in non-nmda glutamate receptor trafficking.

drosophila sec <dig> inhibits microtubule formation in vivo
previous work has demonstrated that exocyst proteins associate biochemically with microtubule proteins  <cit> , and that this association destabilizes microtubules  <cit> . to test whether sec <dig> regulates microtubules at the drosophila nmj, we examined pre and postsynaptic nmj microtubules using an antibody against acetylated tubulin, which preferentially recognizes polymerized tubulin. microtubules are abundant in presynaptic motor axon terminals and throughout postsynaptic muscle cells . both pre- and postsynaptically, microtubules are intimately associated with the nmj . within the drosophila presynaptic motor terminal, microtubules form distinct loops that appear to be critical for presynaptic arborization and regulation of bouton growth  <cit> . postsynaptic muscle microtubules also regulate nmj growth and development  <cit> . in l <dig> animals overexpressing sec <dig> cdna in muscles, microtubule immunoreactivity was noticeably decreased , but this decrease was not statistically significant  =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ).

in contrast, microtubule immunofluorescence at nmjs was approximately doubled in sec8p <dig> and sec8Δ <dig> l <dig> mutant larvae . very little sec <dig> is localized extrasynaptically in wildtype animals. therefore, a change in synaptic microtubule immunofluorescence , but not in extrasynaptic microtubule immunofluorescence , is most consistent with synapse-specific regulation of microtubules by sec <dig>  extrasynaptic microtubule immunofluorescence was not significantly increased in either sec8p <dig> or sec8Δ <dig> l <dig> mutant larvae . we conclude from these data that sec <dig> inhibits microtubules in vivo, as predicted by previous biochemical data showing inhibition of microtubule formation by sec proteins  <cit> .

overexpression of tubulin phenocopies the loss of glutamate receptors seen in sec <dig> mutants
our data suggest that drosophila sec <dig> plays a role in glutamate receptor localization and microtubule regulation. these two phenotypes could represent separate functions for sec <dig>  or could be due to the same root cause. mammalian glutamate receptors are trafficked to the synapse via the microtubule network  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to surmise that the defects in postsynaptic glutamate receptor localization measured in sec <dig> mutants might be due to misregulation of microtubules. to address this, we mimicked the increase in microtubules observed in sec <dig> mutants by overexpressing alpha tubulin. overexpression of an alpha tubulin transgene in postsynaptic muscles using the gal4-uas system doubles microtubule density , presumably due to a shift in the dynamic equilibrium between disassembled and assembled tubulin subunits. this shift toward an increase in microtubules caused a significant decrease in the size and number of postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters, similar to that observed in sec <dig> mutants . these results suggest that the loss of postsynaptic glutamate receptors observed in sec <dig> mutants may be secondary to disruption of microtubule networks.

discussion
ours is the first detailed examination of any multicellular sec <dig> mutant. sec proteins are thought to play a role in almost every cell type, but are particularly highly enriched in the brain. therefore, most interest in sec protein function is within the context of neuronal development and function. sec <dig>  alone or as part of the exocyst complex, has been implicated in several aspects of neural development and function including:  neurite outgrowth  <cit> ,  calcium-dependent neurotransmitter secretion  <cit> ,  trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors  <cit>  and  regulation of neuronal microtubule assembly  <cit> . we explored each of these areas of potential function in drosophila sec <dig> mutants.

surprisingly, we did not see any evidence that sec <dig> is required for neurite extension or nerve terminal growth, at least in motor neurons. instead, sec <dig> mutant nmj motor arborizations were morphologically normal at time of hatching, but then developed more branches and more boutons during larval development, compared to controls. this suggests that sec <dig> suppresses neurite growth. the sec <dig> mutant nmj overgrowth phenotype is unlikely to be an artifact for several reasons:  although our immunoblots showed that 50% of total late embryonic/l <dig> sec <dig> was left after deletion of the gene, sec <dig> in the nmj at the start of larval development was already almost undetectable.  regardless of whether the amount of sec <dig> is reduced to 50% or 0% , there was no detectable impairment of presynaptic terminal growth. instead, nmj growth was enhanced in the sec <dig> mutants.  the nmj growth enhancement occurred entirely during larval development – when maternal sec <dig> was fading to its lowest levels. this sec <dig> mutant nmj overgrowth phenotype is dramatically different from the phenotype observed in sec <dig> mutants  <cit> . drosophila sec <dig> mutants showed a slight increase in nmj growth during l <dig> development , but then progressive deterioration in the ability to form new motor nerve terminals through later larval development  <cit> . this suggests, along with other evidence , that metazoan sec proteins may not always function together as part of a canonical octomeric complex.

because sec proteins are required for membrane secretion in yeast, neuronal sec proteins have long been implicated in neurotransmission, which relies on synaptic vesicle membrane insertion and cycling. however, we did not see any evidence that sec <dig> is critical for neurotransmitter secretion, consistent with recently published descriptions of drosophila sec <dig> and sec <dig> mutants  <cit> , and sec <dig> rnai expression in the fly nmj  <cit> . our result is unlikely to be an artifact of incomplete removal of sec <dig> from the synapse, because even though sec <dig> zygotic null mutants showed substantial maternal contribution of sec <dig> protein , immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy showed that sec <dig> was almost completely absent from mutant early larval nmjs. thus, we were able to examine synaptic function following severe genetic reductions in synaptic sec <dig>  no mutant evidence to date suggests a role for sec proteins in neurotransmission. our data add sec <dig> to the list of tested sec proteins, and strengthen this conclusion.

mammalian sec <dig> has been shown to interact with nmda-type glutamate receptors and the pdz-domain protein sap <dig>  <cit> . this interaction appears critical for delivery of nmda receptors to synaptic membrane in cultured cells  <cit> . sec <dig> also interacts with psd- <dig> and sap- <dig>  <cit> , which are two proteins thought to be important for delivery of non-nmda  glutamate receptors to postsynaptic membranes. thus, sec <dig> has been implicated in trafficking of all types of glutamate receptors. we observed mislocalization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors in drosophila sec <dig> mutants, consistent with a role for sec <dig> in glutamate receptor trafficking. however, the mechanism by which drosophila sec <dig> regulates glutamate receptor trafficking may not be the same as the mechanism proposed for mammalian neurons. as mentioned above, mammalian glutamate receptor trafficking by sec <dig> is thought to occur via interactions with the pdz-domain proteins sap <dig>  psd- <dig> or sap- <dig>  dlg is the sole drosophila member of the mammalian psd-95/sap97/sap <dig> protein family  <cit> . in drosophila dlg mutants, only b-type receptor trafficking/localization is disrupted; trafficking and localization of a-type receptors appear normal  <cit> . but in the sec <dig> mutants described here, trafficking of both a- and b-type receptors was affected. therefore, our evidence suggests that loss of sec <dig> does not selectively disrupt a dlg-dependent glutamate receptor trafficking pathway, which would be expected to lead to loss of only b-type receptors.

exocyst proteins, including sec <dig>  have recently been shown to associate with microtubules in vitro and in cultured cells, and overexpression of sec proteins inhibits microtubule polymerization  <cit> . overexpression of drosophila sec <dig> cdna in vivo also caused a noticeable but statistically insignificant reduction in microtubule immunoreactivity, and sec <dig> loss of function mutants showed dramatically increased microtubule immunoreactivity in nmjs. these results suggest that sec <dig>  probably in conjunction with other sec proteins, locally inhibits synaptic microtubule network assembly and/or stability.

the misregulation of microtubules in sec <dig> mutants could be responsible for the glutamate receptor mislocalization we observed, since glutamate receptors, like other transmembrane proteins, are thought to be transported to synapses via microtubule networks  <cit> . consistent with the idea that the receptor trafficking defects are secondary to microtubule misregulation, postsynaptic overexpression of tubulin increased muscle microtubule density and phenocopied the loss of synaptic glutamate receptors measured in sec8Δ  <dig> mutants. misregulation of microtubules in sec8mutants might also explain the presynaptic growth defects that we observed in sec <dig> mutants. presynaptic growth in the drosophila nmj is known to be dependent on microtubule stability in both pre and postsynaptic cells  <cit> . misregulation of microtubules by either pre or postsynaptic sec <dig> might therefore be expected to trigger defects in presynaptic growth.

regulation of microtubules by sec <dig> might also explain why expression of a sec <dig> transgene in sec <dig> mutant neurons  fails to rescue the synaptic overgrowth , and why overexpression of a sec <dig> transgene in sec <dig> mutant muscle  fails to reverse sec <dig> mutant receptor trafficking phenotypes . traditionally, these results might be taken as genetic evidence that our phenotypes may be due to 'background' mutations. but nervous-system-specific expression sec <dig>  rescues the mutant viability, sec8p <dig> mutants retain their phenotype in trans to a deficiency tpl10) that removes the sec <dig> gene region, and precise excision of the p-element in sec8p <dig> mutants completely reverses all synaptic phenotypes . these results all argue that:  the sec <dig> mutant flies die owing to problems in the nervous system but not the nmj defects, and  all nmj phenotypes are indeed due to specific disruption of sec <dig> 

the failure of transgenic rescue is also consistent with the fact that overexpression of sec <dig>  phenocopies sec <dig> mutants. for example, presynaptic overexpression of sec <dig> causes nmj overgrowth . interestingly, postsynaptic overexpression of sec <dig> also causes nmj overgrowth . this latter result is consistent with the idea that sec <dig> regulates microtubules and the knowledge that microtubule stability – on both the pre and postsynaptic sides of the nmj- is a critical regulator of presynaptic terminal growth and arborization  <cit> .

considered together, our results suggest that a primary role for sec <dig> at synapses may be spatially-restricted regulation of microtubule networks. but we cannot conclude that this is a primary function for other sec proteins. a growing body of evidence suggests that metazoan exocyst proteins may not always function as a canonical hetero-octomeric complex; functionally distinct subcomplexes appear to exist in different cell types or even within the same cell  <cit> . there are, for example, important differences between the sec <dig> mutant phenotypes described here and the phenotypes previously described for drosophila sec <dig> mutants with regard to nmj formation  <cit> . similarly, drosophila expressing sec <dig> rnai in the neuromusculature showed no nmj changes, and sec <dig> was not detected in the nmj  <cit> . more recently, a study of drosophila sec <dig> mutants found more differences between sec mutant phenotypes and argued explicitly for independent sec protein roles  <cit> . thus, several lines of evidence, including expression patterns and phenotypes, suggest that sec proteins function independently in at least some tissues and/or at different times. nevertheless, all drosophila sec mutants show at least partial defects in membrane trafficking, membrane protein distribution and/or cell polarization – processes that rely, at least to some extent, on microtubules. thus, microtubule regulation may be a common thread tying together sec protein function in vivo. one might imagine that different subsets of differentially-regulated sec proteins transiently associate in specific cellular compartments to prune the dynamic microtubule network. this pruning and shaping might ensure that membrane packages are delivered past, or are dropped off at, appropriate places. we think that it is important for future work on sec proteins to consider this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
sec <dig> is abundant in the drosophila nmj. sec <dig> is required in vivo for regulation of synaptic microtubule formation, and  regulation of synaptic growth and glutamate receptor trafficking. we did not find any evidence that sec <dig> is required for basal neurotransmission.
