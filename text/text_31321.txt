BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is an autochthonous ocean-dwelling microbial species comprising bacterial strains that are widely disseminated in marine environments throughout the world. some of these strains cause severe diarrhea when present in seafood  <cit> . new isolates of v. parahaemolyticus that are able to cause diarrhea in humans by ingestion of seafood periodically emerge through their continuous evolution in the ocean. this process occurs via mutations and horizontal gene transfer. the epidemiology of the diarrhea outbreaks caused by different v. parahaemolyticus serotypes changed abruptly after  <dig>  when the emergence of a particular clonal strain  increased the number of diarrhea outbreaks in southeast asia initially, and subsequently worldwide  <cit> . it is likely that this strain acquired pathogenicity islands  <cit>  and secretion system  <cit>  genes by lateral transfer, thereby increasing its pathogenicity. arrival of this strain  in a region of southern chile where most of this country’s seafood is harvested caused one of the world’s largest outbreaks of seafood-related diarrhea  <cit> . the food poisoning outbreaks peaked in  <dig> with about  <dig>  clinical cases, and then gradually decreased to fewer than  <dig> cases in  <dig> to  <dig> . it is though that after its arrival, the pandemic strain growth was favored by both a minor rise in surface seawater temperature and warming of the mussels in the intertidal region due to frequent sunny days. later, a selective effect of bacteriophages with different tropism could have caused its decline  <cit> .

humans become infected when the bacteria occasionally reach the human gastrointestinal tract, mainly via consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. during the chilean epidemic, the pandemic strain consisted of a highly clonal population  <cit> , which reproduced extensively in the chilean shore lines, and shared its habitat with many other related species. it was calculated that mussels on the shores from which these isolates were obtained contained up to  <dig> different v. parahaemolyticus genotypes  <cit> .

here, we investigated the degree of genomic diversification that occurred in this homogeneous population of bacteria during a short independent divergence time among the isolates. previous studies performed by comparison of different dna sequences such as housekeeping genes and multiple tandem repeats, and more recently whole genome sequencing, have shown a small degree of genetic diversity between isolates obtained throughout the world  <cit> . in terms of studying bacterial evolution in a natural habitat, the pandemic v. parahaemolyticus population appears to be particularly appropriate. as achtman and wagner  <cit>  wrote in their review “bacterial pathogens with low synonymous sequence diversity , so-called genetically monomorphic organisms, are promising models to reveal evolutionary mechanisms, and could even be more informative than microbes with greater sequence diversity, in which millions of years of evolutionary history might have blurred genomic signals of phylogenetic history through recombination or eliminated them through genomic reduction”.

in this work, we obtained eight independent chilean isolates of v. parahaemolyticus from mussels or clinical samples and compared their genomes. we show that the predominant evolutionary forces acting on the isolates differ and are probably dependent on the ecological situation and the life circumstances of each bacterium. many of the changes detected would have been difficult to detect in a more heterogeneous bacterial population with longer independent evolution times among its members. thus, the v. parahaemolyticus pandemic population constitutes an appropriate model to study evolutionary mechanisms, despite its low synonymous sequence diversity resulting from its short evolutionary history.

RESULTS
the genomes of eight chilean v. parahaemolyticus isolates and of isolate vpkx, a subculture of the rimd  <dig>  <cit>  strain from south east asia maintained in our laboratory since its arrival from the research institute of medical disease in japan in  <dig>  all corresponding to the pandemic strain group, were sequenced using both a single-end and a mate paired-ends with  <dig> kb span libraries. table  <dig> shows the properties of these isolates and those of vpkx and rimd  <dig> whose genome has been previously sequenced. the chilean isolates were chosen because some represented early isolates from the initial outbreak in  <dig>  and the others those obtained at the peak of the outbreak, between 2004–2007; two corresponded to isolates obtained from shellfish . two of the isolates were also chosen because they contained plasmids. isolate pma <dig>  contains three plasmids previously observed after agarose gel electrophoresis of a plasmid extract  and isolate pmc <dig>  harbors the temperate linear plasmid bacteriophage vp <dig>   <cit> . the sequencing depth coverage was between 25x to 49x for single-end reads and 5x for mate paired-end reads, except for pma <dig> , which was not sequenced using mate paired-end library .table  <dig>

single nucleotide variants 
high quality snvs between the shared genome portion of each isolate were calculated as recently described for v. cholerae  <cit>  by mapping the trimmed reads against the rimd  <dig> genome  <cit>  and considering only snvs with depth coverage higher than  <dig>  times the average depth of coverage for each strain , and a minimum variant frequency of 75%. deletions and insertions were not considered. positions showing snvs between the sequence of each isolate and rimd  <dig> genome were identified, extracted and converted in a concatenated sequence. the resulting concatenated sequence of each isolate was compared with the sequences obtained from all the isolates. this comparison allows determining the snvs among the panel of isolates compared. the total number of polymorphic sites  observed among isolates was  <dig> with  <dig> different differences in base composition. figure  <dig> is an unrooted cladogram showing the relations of the v. parahaemolyticus pandemic isolates from chile and also those of southeast asia, rimd  <dig> and vpkx. the number of snvs among the isolates varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . analysis of the distribution of snvs along the genome showed that they had a poisson distribution as expected for independent mutations that randomly occur in a genome . no snv clusters were observed, as it was by chen et al.  <cit>  in an <dig>  a pandemic isolate that apparently changed serotype by genetic recombination with a closely related v. parahaemolyticus strain  <cit> . twenty-nine snvs were observed between the reported sequence of rimd  <dig> and the sequence obtained for vpkx. however, this was not surprising because we had previously observed differences in the number of serial repeats in some multiple tandem repeat loci between vpkx and the reported sequence of rimd  <dig>  <cit> . such differences were probably generated  during the growth of the bacteria that occurred in the sealed stab agar, which was initially kept at room temperature and was renovated every six months for at least five years. after this time the strain was kept frozen.figure  <dig>

genome size
the genome size of each isolate was estimated as being the length of the genome covered after alignment of the isolate reads against the complete genomic sequence of rimd  <dig>  plus the sum of the length of the contigs formed by reads that did not align to the rimd  <dig> genome. to define these contigs, unaligned reads  were recovered and assembled. the sum of the length of these contigs was then added to the length of the rimd  <dig> genome that was covered to estimate the size of each isolate’s genome. only contigs larger than 316 bp that were not similar to the plasmid vectors used for the library preparation  and had a coverage depth greater than  <dig>  which corresponds to approximately ¼ of the average coverage for the whole genome, were considered. these contigs were also subsequently expanded by further assembly using cap <dig>  table  <dig> shows the estimated genome length of the different chilean isolate and vpkx calculated as the length of the rimd genome plus the length of the contigs formed by reads that did not align with this genome. the length of the rimd genome covered by the reads of all the isolates would correspond to the core genome of the group. the genome size differences relate to the presence or absence of dna regions in some of the isolates but some isolates pair having the same genome size may have gained or lost different dna regions. the amount of dna gained or lost between pairs  was calculated as the sum of the length of the regions present in one isolate but absent in the other and is shown in table  <dig>  under the diagonal. it is not possible to determine if these regions correspond to either newly acquired dna or inherited dna lost by the ancestral bacterium. the length of the largest segment in the rimd genome not covered by reads amounted to  <dig>  bp and corresponded to isolate pmc <dig>  however, we do not imply that this corresponds to dna lost because the rimd  <dig> strain may not be an ancestral bacterium in the chilean isolates.table  <dig>

the nature of the genomic regions that were gained or lost was determined using different procedures. calculation of their gc content  showed large differences with that of rimd  <dig>  which have an average gc content of  <dig> %. annotation using the basic local alignment search tool  against the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant nucleotide database, showed similarity with regions annotated in related species but no pathogenic or secretion related regions were identified. regions not covered by the reads were annotated for the respective regions from the whole genome description of rimd  <dig>  <cit> . these final regions correspond only to segments longer than five neighbor bases with zero coverage after aligning the reads against the reference genome using two different procedures: tmap/samtools and clc workbench. no isolates, including vpkx, had coverage of two regions of  <dig> and 119 bp each in the reference genome of rimd  <dig>  because we compared only chilean isolates these two segments were not considered further. the presence or absence and the properties of the genomic regions in the chilean isolates is shown in table  <dig>  no virulence factors were evident when annotating the contigs absent in rimd  <dig>  three regions were inserted . their insertional nature and position was determined by detection of sequences homologous to the reference genomes at the ends of the scaffolds and reads containing part of the sequence of the insert, together with part of the reference genome sequence. one of the inserts corresponds to an insertion sequence  of  <dig>  nucleotides present in every chilean isolate, except atc <dig>  which has also been reported in three other pandemic v. parahaemolyticus isolates obtained from bangladesh, peru and india  <cit> . this is is flanked by 18 bp direct repeats that are identical to the attachment site  described in the defective but excisable lambdoid prophage cp- <dig>  <cit> , and is inserted in tandem with another is located next to a tmrna in the south east asian reference isolate genome  <cit> . part of the is shows high similarity with a phage integrase and a mobile element protein found in v. parahaemolyticus ucm-v <dig>  <cit> , a strain isolated from a spanish sediment sample that is closely related to rimd  <dig>  a second insert exclusive to pma <dig>  consists of a  <dig>  bp element flanked by a 4 bp repeat , which contains segments annotated as a phage integrase and a putative transposase in v parahaemolyticus ucm-v <dig>  <cit> . the whole region is highly similar to regions found in v parahaemolyticus ucm-v <dig>  v. anguillarum  <dig>  <cit>  and v. cholerae mj <dig>  <cit>  genomes. a third putative is found in three of our isolates but potentially inserted into only two isolates at different positions, consists of a isolate-specific region of variable size , containing  <dig> to  <dig> tandem repeats.table  <dig>

the bulk of the gained dna, however, is plasmid located. two isolates contain the previously described linear plasmid prophage vp <dig>   <cit> , with no detectable high quality snvs between them. one of these isolates  contains besides vp <dig>  two other large plasmids previously observed by gel electrophoresis of a plasmid extract . one of these plasmids  is very similar to plasmid p <dig>  which was found in a vibrio spp. and is similar to enterobacteria phage p <dig>  <cit> . the other plasmid  is highly similar to a plasmid  recently described in the environmental strain of v. parahaemolyticus, ucm-v <dig>  finally, there is a 361 bp contig containing a segment highly similar to pvdj, a gene involved in pyoverdin synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa pa <dig> isolated from a patient. pyoverdin competes directly with transferrin for iron and it is an essential element for in vivo iron gathering and virulence expression in p. aeruginosa. this contig also contains segments identical to those in the rimd  <dig> chromosome but it was not possible to identify it as an insert.

discussion
our results show that the v. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain population, usually called a clonal strain, constitutes an appropriate model to study the types and mechanisms of genome differentiation, a process responsible of the emergence of new pathogens. when comparing the genomes of these so-called genetically monomorphic organisms, we could distinguish differentiation by mutation producing snvs and differentiation by genome content. the latter differences may be caused by dna loss or gain. dna gain occurs by hgt, a process well-established as a major driver of genetic innovation  <cit> . that hgt seems to be the major force shaping the virulence of vibrio spp. was concluded by chen et al.  <cit>  after comparing the genomes of different vibrio spp., including three pandemic strains. by detailing here the number of snvs among common regions of the genome and the amount of dna gained or lost in the different isolates we found that both can largely differ between isolates . we show that while snvs among the chilean isolates varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  gained or lost dna ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp. these results show that in pairwise comparisons  the changes in number of bases by hgt  may be as high as about  <dig>  times the number of snvs  . a study on the evolutionary dynamics of vibrio cholerae o <dig> following its introduction to haiti  <cit> , showed that intrinsic mutational processes accounted for virtually all the observed genetic polymorphism in the  <dig> genomes that were analyzed, with no demonstrable contribution from hgt. this situation is very similar to that observed with isolate atc <dig>  which did not contain dna that was not present in any of the other chilean isolates. although the timespan of v. cholerae isolates is much shorter , the apparent larger contribution of hgt to the genome differentiation of the chilean v. parahaemolyticus isolates can be simply explained by the different ecological scenarios in which these different bacteria lived during the evolutionary time period that was studied. in the haitian epidemics, propagation occurred mainly via contamination by fecal material containing v. cholerae, which reproduced in the human intestinal tract with little opportunity to meet other bacteria sufficiently related to effectively act as dna donors, as would have occurred if significant growth had taken place in seawater environment. v. parahaemolyticus is not transmitted by fecal contamination and the isolates compared in this study reproduced in the littoral zone instead. some, like pma <dig>  and pmc <dig> , might have reproduced in a habitat experiencing close contact with a large and diverse population of other v. parahaemolyticus subgroups and vibrio spp., while others, like atc <dig>  might have reproduced in a habitat free of vibrio spp. sufficiently related to effectively act as dna donors. when the pandemic strain grows in shellfish it shares this habitat with more than  <dig> different v. parahaemolyticus genotypes  <cit> . however, in contrast to what was observed in the haitian epidemics, it is known that when v. cholera reproduces in open aquatic habitats hgt plays a large role in genome diversification  <cit> . our results suggest that the predominant mechanism of genome diversification depends on the ecological scenario in which an isolate lived during the evolutionary period studied.

nasser et al.  <cit>  delineated the nature and timing of molecular events that contributed to other global human epidemic caused by an epidemic group with low synonymous sequence diversity, like pandemic v parahaemolyticus. they compared  <dig>  genome sequences of group a streptococcus differing strain-to-strain on average by only  <dig> snps, excluding the horizontally acquired polymorphisms in a 36-kb region. some of the difficulties to expect a similar successfully detailed description of the evolutionary pathway of pandemic v. parahaemolyticus to increased virulence by analysis of a larger number of isolates is that, differently to group a streptococcus v. parahaemolyticus contains several natural hosts beside humans that there are not detailed analysis of their phenotypic properties related to pathogenicity.

the extraordinary number of snvs in atc <dig> might be the result of inherent properties of this strain, however, the possibility that the high number of snvs in this isolate was simply due to a larger number of divisions because it benefited of a nutrient rich scenario is a simpler explanation. when dealing with short evolutionary times as in this case, the assumption accepted for long evolutionary periods that the replication rate between individuals is the same, is less likely and hence differences in the number of snvs may correspond to differences in growth rate. if hgt depends on the number of divisions undergone by a bacterium, then a certain level of constancy might be expected between the amount of exclusive dna  and the number of snvs present; however, to the contrary, this ratio was highly variable and fluctuated from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

the length of the rimd  <dig> genome covered by the reads of all the isolates would correspond to the core genome of the group. this was calculated as  <dig> , <dig> by subtracting those regions not covered by read from at least one isolate  to the size of rimd  <dig> genome. the sum of the length of the different dna sequences not shared by all the isolates included in this study plus that of the core genome would correspond to the length of the pangenome of the group. this was estimated as  <dig> , <dig> by adding to core genome those regions present in only some isolates . extra dna was found on plasmids, temperate phages or inserted into the bacterial chromosomes. the  <dig>  bp insertion found in every isolate examined except one has been described by chen et al.  <cit>  in the three pandemic strains they sequenced. because no differences were found in the sequence and insertion site of the  <dig>  bp is among the pandemic isolates, its presence seems to be the result of a single event occurring early on the evolution of the pandemic strain. presence of the 160/384 bp inserts in several isolates is a finding that is difficult to interpret. these inserts are similar to a segment described as being next to a transposase in plasmid p87f- <dig> from a new β-lactamase oxa- <dig> carbapenem resistance strain of enterobacter hormaechei isolated in brazil  <cit> . here, the large dna gain resulted from the presence of plasmid and temperate prophages. their stability and effect on the recipient bacterium, especially its pathogenic character, is now a matter of speculation and further research. the extent of dna loss was small compared with dna gain and was mainly caused by complete or partial excision of the prophages. excision of f <dig> has been described previously  <cit> . the f <dig> region is important because it contains orf <dig>  a region used extensively for differentiating pathogenic pandemic strains  <cit> . consistent with recent concepts in bacterial genomics, the difference in genome content described above is an example of how rapidly pan-genomes can be created thereby diversifying an original clonal population in a short period of years.

CONCLUSIONS
populations of v. parahaemolyticus comprising pandemic strains are an appropriate model for studying the various types of genome differentiation and the mechanisms causing it despite the short evolutionary time frames involved. our results show that while snvs among the chilean isolates varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  gained or lost dna varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> . pairwise the number of bases changed by hgt  may be from  <dig> to  <dig>  higher than the number of snvs, approximately. since these isolates are genetically very similar, the different extent of snvs and dna gained or lost between isolates can be best explained by the life circumstances of each isolate.
