BACKGROUND
developments in molecular biology and statistical methodologies have made it possible for the dissection of genetic variation and the localization of economically important quantitative trait loci  in farm animals  <cit> . many qtl associated with economically important traits in cattle have been reported and deposited in the animalqtldb . however, not all of the genetic variation in these traits has been captured because of inadequate sample size and the low density of markers historically used in qtl mapping studies. consequently, confidence intervals obtained for most reported qtl are too large ) to allow the identification of appropriate positional candidate gene for the majority of qtl. recent availability of high-density snp assays that span the genome at high resolution such as the bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit>  now enables the identification of novel qtl and improvement of the resolution of the location of previously mapped qtl.

genome-wide association studies  sometimes identify loci that are not responsible for variation  because  <cit> : 1) stochastic noise can generate false associations in a small sample, and 2) patterns of correlation among loci and factors responsible for trait variation can create indirect associations between markers and traits where no causal relationship exists . the former can be managed by increasing sample size and the latter problem can be solved by validating identified qtl in an independent, but demographically similar population. if the same marker is highly associated across different traits and different populations, then it is very likely to be in strong linkage disequilibrium  with the causal variant.

we performed gwas using 50 k genotypes scored in  <dig>  animals from  <dig> us beef cattle breeds with observations for twelve economically relevant traits . this large data set enabled us to perform an extensive comparative genome-wide association study in cattle , which had as its goal the identification of regions of the genome that account for at least 1% of genetic variation in these traits, and evaluation of genetic architecture of these traits among breeds. this analysis enabled discovery of several important across-breed and breed-specific large-effect pleiotropic or closely linked qtl.table  <dig>

1birth weight: live weight at birth. calving ease direct: the ability of a calf to be born unassisted because of its size and length of gestation. calving ease maternal: the genetic ability of a dam for unassisted calving of her newborn because of her own pelvic size, her ability to relax the pelvis and the ability of her uterus to limit feral growth to a manageable size. carcass weight: weight recorded just before the carcass enters the chilling room during the processing of finished cattle. fat thickness: the amount of fat opposite the ribeye muscle at the cut surface between the 12th and 13th ribs. marbling: the amount and distribution of intramuscular fat on the cut surface of the ribeye muscle between the 12th and 13th ribs. mature weight: live body weight at maturity. ribeye muscle area: area measurement on the cut surface of the ribeye muscle between the 12th and 13th ribs. weaning weight direct: the pre-weaning growth ability of a calf. weaning weight maternal: the milking and mothering ability of a dam for pre-weaning growth of a calf. yearling weight: live weight at yearling. yield grade: the estimated amount of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts from the high-value parts of the carcass-the round, loin, rib, and chunk.



gene enrichment analysis provided valuable information as to the biological functions of gene subsets and dominant pathways imposed in the trait of interest  <cit> . in addition to broad-spectrum gwas, we used gene ontology  tools to allocate biological roles and common pathways involved in the function of candidate genes within the identified pleiotropic qtl.

RESULTS
detected qtl and sample size
a total of  <dig> qtl  were identified across twelve traits recorded in ten breeds . some of the identified qtl were associated with more than one trait  or segregating in more than one breed , which leave  <dig> qtl to be unique . in general, more qtl were identified in the populations  with bigger sample sizes , which simply reflects the increasing statistical power in gwas by increasing sample size  <cit> . however, less qtl were identified in angus and limousin populations than expected by their sample sizes , which could be due to different selection programs practiced in these breeds or due to the biased samples. long-term directional selection changes the frequencies of causative variants toward fixation, which decreases the genetic variations and consequently the power of gwas. this could be the case for these populations especially angus that experienced long-term selection. also, if the samples are not well distributed across the whole population and only a selected group of animals  are sampled then the power of gwas would decrease due to lower genetic variation available in the selected samples . this could be also a possibility with the samples collected in angus and limousin populations. spencer et al.  showed that the patterns of ld and the frequencies of causative variants  also play important roles in the statistical power of gwas  <cit> .table  <dig>

the qtl network. the genomic locations  and the trait associated with each identified qtl. the traits are birth weight , calving ease direct , calving ease maternal , carcass weight , marbling , mature weight , ribeye muscle area , weaning weight direct , weaning weight maternal , yield grade  and yearling weight .



details concerning support and magnitude of effect for each qtl associated with birth weight, calving ease direct, calving ease maternal, carcass weight, marbling, mature weight, ribeye muscle area, weaning weight direct, weaning weight maternal, yield grade and yearling weight in all ten cattle breeds are in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the identity of the most strongly associated snp  within the bayesian gwas model within the 1-mb window most strongly associated with the qtl), its genomic position, its b allele  frequency and the impact of that allele on the trait  are also reported for each qtl in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in this study, a similar 1-mb qtl associated with more than one trait considered as a pleiotropic qtl. however, it could be actually two different closely linked qtl. further analyses using multi-variate models are needed to dissect pleiotropic qtl from closely linked qtl. however, when the b allele at lead-snp is consistent for direction of affect across different breeds, which was the case for most identified lead-snps within identified qtl, then it is more likely to be pleiotropy because with linkage the b allele could detect the qtl1 + \qtl2+ haplotype  in one breed and the a allele could detect it in another. additionally, most of the identified lead-snps are located in master regulator genes, which is further evidence for pleiotropy.

four pleiotropic qtl segregate in several phylogenetically distinct us cattle breeds
among all identified qtl, four pleiotropic qtl were detected in two or more breeds . these pleiotropic qtl were identified on bta <dig> at 37–42 mb , on bta <dig> at 93 mb, on bta <dig> at  <dig> – 26 mb  and on bta <dig> at 4 mb . in general, the qtl on bta <dig> had a larger impact than any of the other qtl and was associated with a greater number of traits in the greatest number of breeds . this qtl is associated with body weights , calving ease direct and weaning weight maternal, in all breeds except angus. it explained more than 10% of additive genetic variance of birth weight in hereford, limousin, red angus and simmental; of calving ease direct in hereford; of carcass weight in red angus and simmental; of mature weight in hereford; of weaning weight direct in limousin and red angus; and of yearling weight in hereford, limousin and red angus. the largest effect found for this qtl was for calving ease in hereford where it explained 32% of additive genetic variance. the 1-mb qtl region on bta <dig> most strongly associated with the traits varied from  <dig> to 39 mb and was not unique across breeds or traits. further, there were six different lead-snps at 38 mb and four different lead-snps at 39 mb detected for different traits and breeds. however, the more frequently model-selected snps in this region were rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb, rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb and rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb . many studies have pointed to the presence of qtl on bta <dig> for body weights, growth and carcass traits , calving ease direct  <cit> , milk traits , reproductive traits  and feed efficiency traits  <cit>  in cattle. three interesting genes located in this region have been suggested as positional candidate genes: 1) lap <dig> , located at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb, which is an aminopeptidase which catalyzes the removal of n-terminal amino acids and is involved in protein maturation and degradation  <cit> ; 2) ncapg , located at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb, which has a catalytic function in the mammalian condensin i complex and is important during mitotic cell division  <cit> ; 3) lcorl , located at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb, which is associated with stature in human and cattle  <cit> . a nonsynonymous substitution in ncapg, ncapg c.1326 t > g that leads to the amino acid change p.ile442met in the ncapg protein has been suggested as the candidate causative variant associated with prenatal  <cit>  and postnatal growth traits  <cit>  in cattle. however, bongiorni et al.  has suggested that lap <dig> is the more probable gene to affect calving ease direct in piedmontese cattle  <cit> . whether the p.ile442met variant is responsible for the pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> detected in this study or if different mutation in ncapg or other genes are involved is currently unknown.table  <dig>

1a total of  <dig> qtl were identified which  <dig> of them were associated with more than trait or segregating in more than one breed leaving  <dig> unique qtl.

the qtl on bta <dig> at 93 mb is pleiotropic and associated with birth weight, calving ease direct and maternal in angus and hereford; carcass weight in angus and simmental; mature weight in hereford; ribeye muscle area in angus, gelbvieh, hereford, red angus and simmental; weaning weight direct and yearling weight in angus, hereford and simmental. this is the most important pleiotropic qtl in angus and is the largest-effect qtl associated with ribeye muscle area in several breeds. this qtl explained more than 16% of additive genetic variance in ribeye muscle area in gelbvieh . associations of this qtl with composition of fatty acids in beef has also been reported  <cit> . only one lead-snp  was detected for this qtl in all associated traits in angus, brangus, hereford and simmental animals. that snp, located at  <dig>  mb, was also lead-snp for a weaning weight direct qtl in red angus . the effect of the b allele at this lead-snp was in the same direction  for the associated traits across different breeds, indicating that linkage phase between this lead-snp and the causal mutation is conserved across breeds  suggesting that the snp is very close to the causal mutation. there is a very good candidate gene located close to this lead-snp. arrdc <dig> , located at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb, is a member of the arrestin superfamily that regulates obesity in mice and human males  <cit> . arrestins are signaling proteins that control metabolism usually through desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptors which are present on the surface of almost every type of mammalian cell. these receptors are stimulated physiologically by the neurotransmitter, norepinephrine and the adrenal medullary hormone, epinephrine  <cit> . it has been shown that oral administration of some beta-adrenergic agonists increases muscle and decreases fat accretion in cattle, pigs, poultry, and sheep  <cit> . consequently, if the casual mutation associated with body weights and carcass traits can be established as influencing arrdc <dig> expression or activity, it could be considered a natural beta-adrenergic agonist in cattle. the physiological roles of arrdc <dig> in cattle are unknown.

the qtl on bta <dig> at  <dig> – 26 mb is segregating in brangus, gelbvieh and simmental. this qtl was associated with five body weights  and calving ease in gelbvieh and simmental and explained  <dig> – 2% of additive genetic variance in carcass, weaning and yearling weights in brangus. no unique lead-snp was detected for this pleiotropic qtl in either the  <dig> or 25 mb windows. three different lead-snps at 24 mb and four different lead-snps at 25 mb  were detected in gelbvieh and simmental. this qtl region harbors plag <dig>  which has been shown to be associated with stature in a holstein × jersey f <dig> cross  <cit> ; carcass weight in japanese black cattle  <cit> ; and early life body weight, peripubertal weight and growth in new zealand holstein–friesian cattle  <cit> . utsunomiya et al.  reported a qtl on bta <dig> in the vicinity of plag <dig> associated with variation in birth weight in nellore cattle suggesting that plag <dig> may also be responsible for variation in body weights in bos indicus cattle  <cit> . our results suggest that mutations in plag <dig> may also be important in brangus, gelbvieh and simmental cattle. whether the same mutation is associated with body weights in brangus, gelbvieh and simmental or if different mutation in plag <dig> or nearby genes cause this variation is unclear.

the pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at 4 mb was segregating in several breeds including angus, shorthorn, hereford, red angus and simmental. this qtl was associated with most body weights and with calving ease direct in these breeds. the telomeric adjacent 1-mb window  also explained  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance of carcass weight in shorthorn and yield grade in simmental, respectively . this qtl explained more than 5% of additive genetic variance for birth, mature and yearling weights; weaning weight direct; calving ease and more than 18% of additive genetic variance of mature weight in hereford . several lead-snps spanning the region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb were identified. the lead-snp rs <dig>  located at  <dig>  mb, was the most frequent model-selected snp within this region across the different traits and breeds. the effect of the b allele at this snp was in the same direction for the associated traits across the different breeds, indicating that this snp is in the same linkage phase with the casual mutation across breeds. this lead-snp is a downstream gene variant  of ergic <dig> . ergic <dig> is a cycling membrane protein contributing to the membrane traffic and selective transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum, the intermediate compartment, and the golgi apparatus, which plays important roles in the organization and function of the early secretory pathway  <cit> . it is unlikely that protein sorting is the sole function of the ergic family, but other functions are less clear  <cit> . the window defining the pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> contains another interesting candidate gene, sh3pxd2b  located at  <dig>  -  <dig>  mb. the sh3pxd2b protein is essential for normal postnatal growth and development  <cit> . in two independent mouse models, the absence of sh3pxd2b was found to profoundly impair normal development causing runted growth, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing impairment, glaucoma and the virtual absence of white adipose tissue  <cit> . in human, sh3pxd2b deficiency is responsible for the development of frank-ter haar syndrome, an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by skeletal, cardiovascular, and eye abnormalities  <cit> . it has been also shown that sh3pxd2b plays an important role in cellular attachment and cell spreading  <cit> .

none of these four pleiotropic qtl was associated with marbling in any breed or with any trait in charolais. besides these four pleiotropic qtl, several qtl were identified that were associated with more than one trait, but segregating in different breeds .

breed-specific pleiotropic qtl
besides the four pleiotropic qtl that were found to segregate in more than one breed, several breed-specific pleiotropic qtl  were identified . a pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at 6 mb associated with birth weight, calving ease direct, marbling, rib eye area, weaning weight direct, weaning weight maternal, and yield grade was identified in limousin. this qtl explained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in these traits, respectively . the telomeric adjacent 1-mb window  also explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in calving ease direct in limousin . two lead-snps  in close proximity, separated by less than  <dig>  mb , were detected. this qtl window harbors myostatin  a major gene responsible for double-muscled phenotype in cattle  <cit> . this phenotype occurs at high frequency in some breeds of cattle such as belgian blue and piedmontese  <cit> . there are numerous mutations in this gene including non-synonymous, missense, premature stop codons and frame-shift variants that are associated with different levels of change in muscle morphology  <cit> . a specific mstn mutation identified as f94l, has been shown to be associated with increased muscle growth and beef traits in limousin  <cit> .

a pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at  <dig> – 50 mb associated with birth weight, calving ease direct, marbling and ribeye muscle area was identified in brangus. cumulatively , this qtl explained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in these traits, respectively . this qtl also associated with ribeye muscle area in angus . however, there was no overlap between identities of lead-snps in angus and brangus. this qtl window harbors some very good candidate genes. the lead-snp rs <dig>  detected for birth weight in brangus , is located in an intron of hmga <dig> . the hmga proteins are architectural transcription factors that regulate transcription of a variety of genes and direct cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . hmga <dig> variants are associated with human height  <cit> , body size in dogs  <cit>  and horses  <cit> , and meat quality and carcass traits in pigs  <cit> . hmga <dig> knockout mice had 40% of the mean body weight of controls  <cit> . the other lead-snp, rs <dig>  which was detected for calving ease direct in brangus , is located in an intron of msrb <dig> . lee et al.  have shown that methylation of msrb <dig> is associated in humans with changes in gestational age at birth  <cit> . mutations in msrb <dig> are also associated with hereditary deafness and primary tooth development during infancy in human  <cit> . the lead-snp for ribeye muscle area in brangus  is located in an intron of lemd <dig> , which is responsible for bone density disorders  <cit> . loss of function mutations in lemd <dig> result in increased bone density, namely osteopoikilosis in human  <cit> . although many qtl associated with body weights, meat and milk traits have been reported in this region  <cit> , no associations between traits and variants in hmga <dig>  msrb <dig> and lemd <dig> have been reported in cattle.

a pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at 106 mb in hereford explained  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in birth weight, mature weight, weaning weight direct and yearling weight, respectively . lead-snp rs <dig> located on bta <dig> at  <dig>  mb was associated with birth weight, weaning weight direct and yearling weight while rs <dig> located  <dig>  mb telomeric of rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb was associated with mature weight in hereford. lead-snp rs <dig> is located in an intron of the fructose- <dig> -bisphosphotase tigar . tigar, which also known as the chromosome  <dig> open reading frame or c12orf <dig> in human, is a recently identified fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase that contributes to regulation of glucose metabolism  <cit> . knockdown of tigar increased glycolysis with elevated fructose- <dig> -biphosphate levels and reduced myocyte apoptosis whereas overexpression of tigar reduced glucose utilization and increased myocyte apoptosis in mice  <cit> . there is a missense variant  within this gene, which causes a v94a substitution. that variant could be one of the potential candidate quantitative trait nucleotides for the body weight associations in hereford.

another breed-specific pleiotropic qtl was identified in hereford on bta <dig> at 38–39 mb and was associated with mature weight and ribeye muscle area explaining  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in each of these traits, respectively. there was no overlap in the identity of lead-snps within this qtl window. a pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> was reported in the range  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb associated with carcass weight, mature height and ribeye muscle area in angus  <cit> .

two breed-specific pleiotropic qtl associated with carcass, weaning and yearling weights were identified in maine-anjou, one on bta <dig> at 61 mb and the other on bta <dig> at 30 mb. the bta <dig> qtl explained less than 2% of additive genetic variance in these three traits, while the bta <dig> qtl explained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance . lead-snp rs <dig> located on bta <dig> at  <dig>  mb was detected for weaning weight direct and yearling weight in maine-anjou. this lead-snp is located just  <dig>  mb telomeric of sept <dig> , a member of the septin gene family. the septins are conserved gtp-binding proteins that form filaments during cell divisions or cytokinesis  <cit> . the septins are also important in embryonic and nervous system development in animals  <cit> . there are several reported qtl in this region that are associated with body weights in angus cattle  <cit> , carcass traits in japanese black cattle  <cit>  and social behaviors in charolais and holstein  <cit> . therefore, sept <dig> may be a good candidate gene for the qtl associated with body weights in maine-anjou.

lead-snp rs <dig> located on bta <dig> at  <dig>  mb was also detected for carcass weight, weaning weight direct and yearling weight in maine-anjou. this lead-snp is located in kirrel <dig> , which is essential for the formation of synapses for cell-cell communication  <cit> . variants in kirrel <dig> are associated with intellectual disability in human  <cit> . many qtl associated with carcass, production, reproduction and behavior traits have been reported in different cattle breeds in this region  <cit> .

trait-specific qtl
only one trait-specific qtl  was identified and it was on bta <dig> at 2 mb . it was associated with weaning weight maternal in charolais, hereford and simmental and explained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in these breeds, respectively . the lead-snp rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb was detected for weaning weight maternal in charolais and simmental while rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb was found in hereford. the adjacent telomeric 1-mb window to this qtl window  explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in weaning weight maternal in angus and gelbvieh . the milk production ability of a cow in terms of total energy available to the calf  is a key factor affecting weaning weight in beef cattle. many qtl associated with milk production traits  have been reported in this region  <cit> . mcclure et al.  also reported a qtl on bta <dig> at 1– <dig>  mb associated with weaning weight maternal in angus cattle  <cit> . mrap <dig> , which is located in this qtl window encodes a melanocortin receptor-interacting protein that regulates trafficking and function of all members of the melanocortin receptor family in the adrenal gland  <cit> . associations among polymorphisms in different melanocortin receptor family members and milk production traits in cattle and sheep have now been established  <cit> . loss of function of mrap <dig> is associated with mammalian obesity  <cit> .

trait-breed specific qtl
several trait-breed specific qtl  were identified . most of these qtl explained less than 2% of additive genetic variance of their corresponding trait in their respective breed. however, some of them explained a larger percentage of genetic variance. for example, a trait-breed specific qtl on bta <dig> associated with birth weight explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in brangus . the lead-snp rs <dig> on bta <dig> at  <dig>  mb is an intronic variant within ccser <dig>  ccser <dig> deficiency creates a cell division defect in human  <cit> . experimental knockdown of ccser <dig> expression caused cytokinesis defects, multipolar mitosis and multinuclearity  <cit> . a trait-breed specific qtl associated with calving ease maternal  was identified in angus on bta <dig> at 73 mb . the lead-snp, rs <dig> located on bta <dig> at  <dig>  mb, is an intronic variant within prkch protein kinase c. laramée et al.   <cit>  showed that parathyroid-related peptide and parathyroid hormone, which have important roles in maternal-fetal calcium homeostasis, operate through activation of protein kinase c.

five trait-breed specific qtl associated with marbling were identified in gelbvieh on bta <dig> at 11 mb and 43 mb; on bta <dig> at 72 mb; on bta <dig> at 46 mb; and on bta <dig> at 39 mb . these cumulatively explained about 30% of additive genetic variance in marbling in gelbvieh and the largest-effect qtl on bta <dig> explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance . there are few reported qtl in these regions associated with marbling in cattle. mcclure et al.  reported a similar qtl on bta <dig> at 11 mb associated with marbling score in angus cattle  <cit> . casas et al.  reported overlapping qtl associated with fat thickness, ribeye muscle area and tenderness score on bta <dig>  <cit> .

two adjacent trait-breed specific qtl on bta <dig> at  <dig> and 113 mb cumulatively explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in ribeye muscle area in shorthorn . another qtl on bta <dig> at 34 mb explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance of ribeye muscle area in shorthorn . a trait-breed specific qtl located on bta <dig> at 42 mb explaining  <dig> % of additive genetic variance of yield grade was identified in red angus . no qtl associated with yield grade have previously been reported in this region. we should point out that the reported trait-breed specific qtl are not validated qtl as they were identified only in one population and associated only with one trait. independent populations are needed to validate these qtl.

genetic architecture of traits
figure  <dig> shows the proportions of additive genetic variance explained by each of the across-breed and breed-specific pleiotropic qtl; and all other identified qtl. the four across-breeds pleiotropic qtl  and the breed-specific pleiotropic qtl explained most of the detected additive genetic variances of body weights  and calving ease direct in ten cattle breeds. the pleiotropic qtl explained a significant percentage of additive genetic variances of these traits cumulatively . if the causal mutations of these pleiotropic qtl were found by further genotyping and statistical analyses, then knowledge of such mutations would create new opportunities for cattle breeders to select their animals with appropriate body weights for harvest or maternal purposes based on the few number of genes.figure  <dig> 
proportions of additive genetic variance explained by detected qtl. the proportions of additive genetic variance explained by detected qtl  for each trait in  <dig> us cattle breeds. the traits are birth weight , calving ease direct , calving ease maternal , carcass weight , marbling , mature weight , ribeye muscle area , weaning weight direct , weaning weight maternal , yield grade  and yearling weight . the breeds are shown as aan , brg , bsh , cha , gvh , her , lim , ran , rdp  and sim .



different genetic architectures were observed for meat quality  and maternal  traits. the detected qtl for these traits explained a lower percentage of genetic variances than those detected for body weights. this may reflect the fact that more selection pressure is on meat quality traits than growth traits in beef cattle, which may change the frequency of favorable allele toward fixation, which decreases the genetic variance explained by a given qtl. moderate body weights are more desirable for many producers because of increased calving problems and higher maintenance feed costs for animals with high body weights. the more likely reason could be the lack of power to detect qtl for meat quality traits due to less accurate data for carcass than growth traits. the accuracy of deregressed estimated breeding values , used as response variables to estimate snp effects, are generally lower for carcass traits versus growth traits due to lower number of observations and indirect measurement. for example, the average of reliability of debv for carcass weight, marbling and ribeye area in angus was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , while it was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for birth, weaning and yearling weights, respectively.

most of the detected additive genetic variances for meat quality traits were explained by trait or trait-breed specific qtl and the pleiotropic qtl had less impact on these traits except for the pleotropic qtl on bta  <dig> for ribeye muscle area and the limousin-specific pleiotropic qtl on bta  <dig>  the qtl associated with ribeye muscle area had little overlap across the ten breeds. the pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at 93 mb was the only qtl associated with ribeye muscle area segregating in more than one breed . the pleiotropic qtl on bta <dig> at 6 mb explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance in ribeye muscle area in limousin  while a second qtl on bta <dig> at 38 mb explained  <dig> % of additive genetic variance. only ten large-effect qtl were identified for yield grade in the five breeds recorded for the trait. the qtl on bta <dig> at 6 mb in limousin  was the largest-effect qtl explaining  <dig> % of additive genetic variance . five of these qtl were identified in red angus, three in simmental and one in gelbvieh and none overlapped . there was also no overlap in marbling qtl across different breeds, which could be partly due to lack of power to detect all qtl associated with marbling in different breeds. obviously not all qtl are discovered and those that are detected are different partly due to chance in different breeds. the qtl associated with weaning weight and calving ease maternal also had little overlap across the ten different breeds. the qtl on bta <dig> at 2 mb was the only qtl associated with weaning weight maternal segregating in more than one breed . the detected qtl explained less than 50% of additive genetic variances of the traits across all ten breeds . this shows that a large number of loci of small effect are necessary to capture the remaining genetic variation as has been shown previously  <cit> . here, we should acknowledge that the reported percentage of additive genetic variance explained for the identified qtl could be biased upward  due to influence of the prior used in the bayesian regression model  <cit> .

one might expect to find largely the same variants segregating in phylogenetically similar breeds due to their limited number of generations since divergence . however, we did not find overwhelming evidence that this was the case since, for example, the first of the across-breed pleiotropic qtl was found to segregate in all breeds except angus, yet angus is closely related to other british breeds, namely red angus, hereford and shorthorn breeds. this result cannot be explained by small sample size since the angus sample was the second largest studied. however, inadequate sample size may explain why qtl were not detected in charolais, maine-anjou and shorthorn. we suspect that resolution as to the concordance of causal mutations across breeds will not be resolved until multiple individuals from each of these breeds are sequenced to identify the extent of sharing of variation among breeds. additional genotyping for variants discovered by sequencing and additional statistical analyses will be required to resolve identities of casual mutations. elucidation of even a few of these mutations will create new opportunities for selection of animals with appropriate harvest body weights and meat quality specifications as well as for creation of maternal lines which could decrease dystocia and increase growth rate of calves in the us cattle population.

genes involved in ossification and in adipose tissue development are over-represented in the pleiotropic qtl
four across-breed pleiotropic qtl , limousin-specific pleiotropic qtl on bta  <dig> and hereford-specific pleiotropic qtl on bta  <dig> were associated with the greater number of traits . genes within these pleiotropic qtl along with the genes within brangus-specific pleiotropic qtl  were interrogated for go  category and kegg  pathway enrichment using the web-based tool g:profiler   <cit>  go analysis of the genes within these pleiotropic qtl showed significant enrichment for functional categories related to tissue development especially ossification and adipose tissue development . interestingly, all of the  <dig> pleiotropic qtl had genes involved in tissue development, where four of them include genes involved in the ossification process and  <dig> others involved our candidate genes  in adipose tissue development . the go categories related to the cellular responses to the chemical stimulus, and the regulations of cation  transporter activities were also significantly over-represented in the pleiotropic qtl . the pathway enrichment revealed that  <dig> genes  from  <dig> pleiotropic qtl  are significantly associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathway . the mapk cascade is a highly conserved module that controls many cellular events from complex programs, such as embryogenesis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell death, to short-term changes required for homeostasis and acute hormonal responses  <cit> .table  <dig>

some of the significant go categories are not convincing to have pleiotropic roles  or some of the genes listed in the significant go categories have a wider role than just that significant category . also, some of the significant go categories do not include any candidate genes identified from association study in the pleiotropic qtl . this could be partly due to the go analysis approach that we used in this study. here, all genes within a 1-mb were simply considered as significant genes. this assumption limits the analysis to find biological meaning.

CONCLUSIONS
although many quantitative trait loci  associated with economically important traits in beef cattle have been identified, not all of the genetic variation in these traits has been captured because of inadequate sample size and insufficient density of markers historically used in qtl mapping studies. here, we took advantage of a high-density snp assay that spans the genome at moderate resolution in conjunction with large sample size  for the identification of novel qtl and improvement of the resolution of the location of previously mapped qtl. we found a total of  <dig> unique large-effect qtl , where four qtl have pleiotropic effects  and segregate in more than one breed. we also found pleiotropic qtl that segregate in single breeds. go analysis revealed that genes involved in ossification and in adipose tissue development were over-represented in the identified pleiotropic qtl. also, go analysis showed that our identified pleiotropic qtl harbor genes that involved in the mapk signaling pathway. our results will improve understanding of the biology of growth and body composition in cattle.
