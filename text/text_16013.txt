BACKGROUND
squamosa promoter binding proteins  constitute a transcription factor  family exclusively found in green plants. arabidopsis thaliana  homologs have been related to developmental and adaptive programmes, such as plastochron determination  <cit> , leaf morphogenesis  <cit> , vegetative phase transition  <cit> , flowering  <cit> , anther and gynoecium development  or innate immunity  <cit>  and copper deficiency response  <cit> .

despite evolutionary divergence between the different family members, the tertiary structure of all sbp proteins encompasses the founding sbp-domain. it consists of a  <dig> amino acid signature including a functional bipartite nuclear localisation signal  and a series of  <dig> conserved cysteine and histidine residues organized in two unconventional zinc fingers  . structural and functional studies suggested that zf <dig> would maintain the sbp folding, while zf <dig> would confer selectivity for the dna sequence to bind  <cit> . therefore, the sbp domain facilitates nuclear translocation and confers the capability to bind dna-motifs harbouring a gtac core sequence  <cit> .

the sbp genes appear in moderately sized-families. the arabidopsis genome encodes  <dig> different sbp-like  proteins grouped in  <dig> classes according to size, sequence similarity and structure and expression patterns of the respective genes. based on these criteria, the denoted large spls  conform a class representing the most complex and constitutively expressed genes. the other class is constituted by the small spls, whose expression is refined by the well-conserved and related micrornas mir156/ <dig>  with spl <dig> as a notable exception  <cit> .

in recent years, the chlamydomonas reinhardtii copper response regulator crr <dig> and its closest arabidopsis homolog spl <dig> attracted attention because of their deeply conserved function as central orchestrators of cu homeostasis  <cit> . cu is an essential micronutrient for virtually all eukaryotes since its redox properties are optimal for essential catalytic functions in protein complexes. indeed, plant cells rely on cu-proteins to deal with oxidative stress, energy production, lignification, or pollen tube guidance  <cit> . furthermore, cu has also been reported to play a structural role in the ethylene and salicylic acid receptors, as well as in the molybdenum cofactor . however, an excess of free cu ions will damage cellular components, e.g. lipids, proteins or nucleic acids, due to the generation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . to cope with this dual nature of cu, cells possess a fine-tuned homeostatic network aimed at maintaining cu levels within a proper range. although the general features of this network are conserved among all eukaryotes, main evolutionary divergences concern the regulatory mechanisms. during cu starvation in arabidopsis, spl <dig> directly binds to gtac motif-containing cu response elements  located in the promoter regions of cu responsive genes  <cit> . in a first response, a cu-uptake system based on the cu-metalloreductases fro4/ <dig> and the plasma membrane-related cu transport proteins copt1/2/ <dig> is promoted  <cit> . secondly, spl <dig> reprograms cellular gene expression for a more efficient cu usage and distribution within the plant, thereby prioritizing delivery to essential enzymes. in this way, levels of particular micrornas, denoted cu-mirnas and including mir <dig> and mir <dig>  are raised to translationally repress production of non-essential cu-requiring proteins, such as the cytosolic cu/zn superoxide dismutase , chloroplastic csd <dig>  plantacyanin or the laccases. suppression of csd <dig> and the promotion of fsd <dig> represent a coordinated substitution of the chloroplastic superoxide dismutases that facilitates a preferential delivery of cu to plastocyanin   <cit> .

however, the mechanism underlying spl <dig> activation is not fully understood, especially with regard of cu sensing and protein regulation. spl <dig> is a constitutively expressed gene detected in all plant tissues regardless of cu availability. consequently, a post-translational regulation for this tf has been proposed  <cit> . within this context, we recently reported the physical interaction between spl <dig> and a kin17-domain encoding protein  to stimulate spl <dig> targets during cu starvation  <cit> . moreover, the in vitro sbp-dna binding could be prevented by cu ions probably replacing complexed zn ions and thereby changing the conformation of spl7-like proteins  <cit> . here, we present a functional characterisation of conserved domains in the spl <dig> protein as to come to a better understanding of how its activity may be regulated in response to cellular cu status in arabidopsis. our subcellular and biochemical approaches revealed that the presence of a tmd recruits spl <dig> to the microsomal fraction, likely at the er membrane and suggests a proteolytic cleavage prior to its nuclear translocation. interestingly, our data indicate that cu deficiency implicates er stress and could constitute a driving force to activate spl <dig>  moreover, a spl <dig> dimerization domain could act in a mechanism to prevent the protein from entering the nucleus.

RESULTS
a conserved transmembrane domain is sufficient to anchor spl7-like proteins to the plasma membrane
in order to identify conserved protein signatures possibly participating in spl <dig> function, we carried out a comprehensive multiple alignment among spl <dig> and orthologs from different species including di- and monocots, a gymnosperm, a bryophyte and green algae. initially, we paid attention to a  <dig> amino acid hydrophobic region located in the carboxy-terminal region, and found it to be conserved in all higher plant spl <dig> homologs . the tmhmm prediction service  retrieved this region as a putative tmd. therefore, to investigate whether this domain is capable of tethering spl <dig> to cellular membranes, we fused the tmd c-terminal to the green fluorescent protein   and transiently expressed it in tobacco leaves. in order to discriminate the plasma membrane, samples were incubated with the lipophilic styryl dye fm4- <dig> under cold conditions. as shown in figure 1b, confocal imaging revealed a gfp signal outlining the transformed cells and perfectly overlapping with the fm4- <dig> signal.figure  <dig>

to further confirm our data, we also performed a biochemical fractionation using total extracts from transfected tobacco leaves. enriched microsomal , cytosolic  and nuclear  fractions were analysed by western blot using antibodies against gfp and selected organelle markers. in this case, the gfp::tmd clearly associated with the microsomal fraction . altogether these observations point to the predicted tmd domain as able and sufficient to anchor proteins to the plasma membrane.figure  <dig>

spl <dig> exhibits a dual subcellular localisation and likely requires proteolytic cleavage to become translocated to the nucleus
the above-stated results concerning the presence of a tmd seem to oppose the function of a conserved bipartite nls within the sbp domain and the rather constitutive nuclear localization reported in our previous observations, as well as for several other sbp-domain proteins  <cit> . therefore, we addressed the question whether spl <dig> could display a dual subcellular distribution. for this purpose, we generated camv 35s promoter-driven transgenes consisting of the entire spl <dig> coding region and fused in frame either 5′ or 3′ to gfp to allow the constitutive expression of either n-terminal or c-terminal tagged spl <dig> protein . since we failed to reliably detect gfp fluorescent signals in arabidopsis plants stably transformed with these constructs, we decided to use agro-infiltration of tobacco leaves as a heterologous system to assess the subcellular localization of the encoded protein products. strikingly, while gfp::spl <dig> distributed homogeneously within the nucleoplasma excluding the nucleolus, the c-terminal tagged version located around the nucleus and to filamentous structures in cytoplasmic strands . as the latter pattern suggested possible association with the er, we co-infiltrated the spl7::gfp-encoding construct with an er marker fused to the mcherry fluorescent protein . this revealed a high degree of co-localization of both fluorescent signals, most intensely around the nucleus . moreover, we also subjected total extracts from 35s::gfp::spl <dig> and 35s::spl7::gfp transformed leaves to a biochemical fractionation, as described above. indeed, gfp::spl <dig> protein was detected in the nuclear enriched fraction, whereas spl7::gfp primarily associated with the microsomal fraction , thereby corroborating the microscopic observations. consequently, these data strongly suggest spl <dig> to distribute between the nucleus and the endomembrane system.

interestingly, although estimating that gfp would contribute ~ <dig> kda and spl7 ~  <dig> kda, the observed apparent molecular weight of both gfp-tagged spl <dig> versions seemed more consistent with ~ <dig> kda . since membrane-anchored proteins must be somehow released prior to their translocation to the nucleus and exert their function, we investigated if these observed bands could correspond to cleaved spl <dig> products. to this end, total protein extracts from transformed tobacco leaves expressing either gfp::spl <dig> or spl7::gfp were also analysed by western blot. a pattern including two specific bands was obtained regardless of the position of the tag . we considered that the upper band  could correspond to the full-sized spl <dig> while the presence of the second lower band  in both cases might be explained if spl <dig> would have been cleaved in the middle . this processing would thus render a derived polypeptide fitting the observed size .

these results are consistent with an arranged pattern where the n-terminal half of spl <dig> translocates to the nucleus following proteolytic cleavage, whereas the c-terminal half would remain attached to some endomembrane, such as the er.

cu deficiency generates endoplasmic reticulum stress, a metabolic perturbation that promotes spl <dig> target activity
because spl <dig> transcript levels remain relatively constant irrespective of cu availability, post-translational mechanisms have been proposed to regulate this tf  <cit> . assuming that spl <dig> could be initially attached to the er membrane, we wondered whether perturbations affecting the functionality of this organelle would trigger spl <dig> processing and activation. in this context, it is well known that adverse environmental conditions result in miss-folding of er-resident proteins  <cit> . to counteract this so-called er stress, a defined unfolded protein response  is generated through the activation of genes coding for folding-assisting proteins  <cit> . curiously, genes categorized as upr markers appeared relatively down-regulated in a transcriptomic assay in shoots from plants hydroponically cultured on cu sufficient media  <cit> . thus, we decided to investigate whether varying cu supply may influence er stress. thereto, transcript levels of reported upr markers were determined in seedlings grown on ½ ms media supplemented with either the cu-specific chelator bcs 50 μm , cuso <dig> 1 μm  or 10 μm . interestingly, our selected markers, including the tf bzip <dig> , the disulfide isomerase-like protein , the luminal binding proteins bip <dig>   and calreticulin  were all slightly induced  following cu deficient conditions . our results thus uncovered that cu deficiency to some degree seems to result in er stress.figure  <dig>

to further investigate the likely connection between er stress and spl <dig> activation, we monitored the behaviour of spl <dig> target genes in seedlings treated with upr-inducing drugs. thereto, 5-day-old wild type seedlings grown on low but cu sufficient medium  were incubated for 3 h on liquid ½ ms with tunicamycin  <cit> , an inhibitor of n-linked protein glycosylation, or dithiothreitol , disrupting disulphide bond formation. the presence of er stress in our experimental conditions was confirmed by raised bip <dig>  and crt <dig> transcript levels in comparison to controls . moreover, the transcript abundance of the analysed spl <dig> targets was generally increased, with dtt producing a more prominent effect . indeed, seedlings exposed to dtt raised transcript levels of fsd <dig>  copt <dig> and mir398c ca.  <dig> -fold in comparison to untreated controls, while copt <dig> showed the strongest induction  . in addition, since this response could not be observed in the spl7- <dig> mutant line, we concluded that the stimulation of the cu-response during er stress is spl7-dependent. altogether, our results suggest that cu deficiency induces er stress, which could be used as a signal to promote the activation of spl <dig> figure  <dig>

spl <dig> is able to homodimerize in vivo
protein-protein interactions could also constitute a post-translational mechanism to refine spl <dig> function. therefore, we conducted a yeast-two-hybrid  screening aimed at identifying putative spl7-interacting proteins. besides kin <dig>  on which we recently reported  <cit> ,  <dig> different preys corresponding to spl <dig> itself were fished when using an spl <dig> fragment as bait, strongly suggesting spl <dig> homodimerization . interestingly, all preys encompassed an evolutionary well-conserved ca.  <dig> aa signature marked by the so-called irpgc domain . to further confirm the spl7-spl <dig> interaction, the entire spl <dig> coding sequence was amino-terminally fused to the influenza hemagglutinin  epitope tag  and co-expressed with gfp::spl <dig> in tobacco leaves. subsequent western blot analysis uncovered that gfp::spl <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ha::spl <dig> in a ha pull-down assay . remarkably, because the co-immunoprecipitated peptides corresponded in size to the putative spl7-processed version , we concluded that the dimerization likely constitutes a post-cleavage event. moreover, the spl <dig> homodimerization was also ascertained by bimolecular fluorescence complementation . for this purpose, in-phase translational fusions between the entire spl <dig> coding sequence and the two split-yellow fluorescent protein  halves in amino-terminal position  were generated and co-expressed in tobacco leaves. whereas expression of the individual constructs with the complementary empty vector did not generate any specific yfp-derived fluorescence, concomitant expression resulted in a yfp signal mainly located at the nuclei in widefield epifluorescence microscopy . however, confocal microscopy enabled a more accurate observation of the reconstituted yfp fluorescence signal and revealed a pattern mirroring the endomembrane system, as previously observed for spl7::gfp, and largely excluded from the nucleus . on the contrary, a yfp signal could not be reconstituted when using carboxy-terminal fusions . taken these data together, we conclude that spl <dig> dimerization takes place outside the nucleus, probably at or in the vicinity of the er after being processed. we may envisage that this dimerization constitutes a regulatory mechanism to restrict spl <dig> from entering the nucleus, i.e. as a negative feedback mechanism.figure  <dig>

.  for a pull-down assay by means of an antibody against ha , total protein was extracted from tobacco leaves transiently expressing full-size spl <dig> tagged either with gfp or ha epitopes . input and bound fractions were assayed by western blot using an anti-gfp antibody to assess gfp::spl <dig> co-immunoprecipitation. membranes were reprobed with an anti-ha-hrp  antibody to check for ha::spl <dig> pull-down. sizes of molecular-weight markers run on the same gels are indicated at the left according to manufacturer’s indications for precasted gels. note that the apparant molecular weights may differ in comparison to those shown in figure  <dig> due to the use of a different separation matrix for electrophoresis.  for bimolecular fluorescent complementation  analysis the split-yfp tags were n-terminal fused to the full-size spl <dig> protein  and co-expressed in tobacco leaves. restoration of the yfp fluorescence signal could be observed with widefield epifluorescence microscopy using a yfp band-pass filter. co-expression of the individual constructs with their complementary empty vectors  did not result in reconstitution of yfp fluorescence.  a representative confocal microscopic image of the reconstituted yfp fluorescence illustrating its predominant extranuclear localization is shown together with chlorophyll autofluorescence and merged images. scale bars, 25 μm.



arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing the spl7-sbp domain exhibit constitutive activation of spl <dig> targets
in addition to the above-mentioned post-translational processing and protein-protein interactions, i.e. proteolytic cleavage and dimerization, spl <dig> function may also be altered following conformational changes. indeed, cu ions have been reported to preclude both chlamydomonas crr1-sbp and spl7-sbp dna-binding capability in vitro  <cit> . consequently, the replacement of zn ions by cu at the zfs results in a conformational change that could constitute an additional regulatory mechanism to inactivate spl <dig>  to further validate this postulate in vivo, stably transformed lines constitutively expressing a gfp-tagged spl <dig> protein truncated immediately behind the sbp domain were generated in the spl7- <dig> background . importantly, gfp::sbp/spl7- <dig> lines were not only able to complement the spl <dig> mutant phenotypes under cu limitation with respect to root growth, size or silique production , but a gfp signal also became microscopically detectable in planta . gfp::sbp fluorescent signal could be detected at high levels within nuclei of both roots and shoots of 5-day-old seedlings grown on media differing in cu availability . these observations indicate that cu availability does not markedly affect stability of the spl7-sbp domain.figure  <dig>

then, to learn if cu actually impedes functionality of the sbp domain, transcript levels of selected spl7-targets were monitored by qpcr in 7-day-old wild-type and gfp::sbp/spl7- <dig> seedlings grown on a gradient of cu concentrations. to this end, the standard ½ ms  was supplemented with cuso <dig> to achieve cu sufficiency  or cu excess . as shown in figure  <dig>  copt <dig>  pre-mir398c and cch transcript levels in wild type already reached their minimum in the presence of 1 μm cu, i.e. a drastic reduction of ca. 20-fold, 10-fold and 4-fold, respectively, compared to cu deficient conditions. in contrast, a similar comparison between the gfp::sbp/spl7- <dig> lines showed a more moderate reduction of ca. 5-fold for cch and less than 2-fold for copt <dig> and mir398c and remained significantly higher in comparison to wild type . moreover, these elevated levels in the transgenic seedlings remained largely constant along the gradient, even under physiologically incompatible cu conditions .figure  <dig>

all together, our data indicate that neither the stability of the sbp domain nor its function is severely affected by cu ions in planta. based on these results, we suggest that protein domains outside the sbp-domain of spl <dig> are likely to have a more profound effect on spl <dig> activity in response to cu availability.

discussion
green plants, from single-celled algae to angiosperms, rely on an evolutionary well-conserved sbp-box tf to orchestrate their adaptive response to cu deprived periods. as potential tfs, all spl7-like proteins contain a functional bipartite nls overlapping zf <dig> within the sbp-domain  <cit> . however, our cellular and biochemical approaches confirmed the anchoring of spl <dig> to the microsomal fraction, most likely to the er-membrane, through a c-terminal tmd . consequently, a not yet identified molecular mechanism must facilitate the observed dual localization of spl <dig> in cells.figure  <dig> 
a working model for the regulation of spl <dig> function. cu supply depends on extracellular input and mobilization from intracellular stores via selective cu-transport proteins, copt. acquired cu is complexed by a set of metallochaperones, like cch and atx <dig>  and delivered to specific targets. as main orchestrator of the cu starvation response, spl <dig> may be among these targets in order to become or remain repressed in the presence of sufficient cu. this may be achieved through a direct interaction with delivered cu resulting in an inability of spl <dig> to bind to cure motifs in the promoter regions of its targets genes . in addition or alternatively, proteolytic processing of er membrane-tethered spl <dig> may be repressed in the presence of cu . as a consequence, activation of spl <dig> in response to cu-deficiency may thus result from a relief of these repression mechanisms. furthermore, er stress caused by a failure to fulfil the demand for cu of proteins involved in the secretory pathway, may actively promote the release of the membrane-bound spl <dig> . finally, a precocious dimerization to modulate the cu deficiency response as the amount of released spl <dig> continues to raise may prevent spl <dig> from entering the nucleus either due to nls masking or exceeding the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore .



in this sense, er-membrane tethered tfs  might provide an illustrative example to infer the spl <dig> mechanism since they exhibit a similar behaviour. this class of tfs display an initial latent form when attached to membranes and require some sort of processing to be released and eventually translocated to the nucleus  <cit> . er-mttfs nuclear-localised versions are generated as a result of two main strategies, namely mrna processing and proteolytic cleavage. although alternative mrna splicing has been reported to produce a non-anchored version of the bzip <dig> er stress transducer  <cit> , this mechanism would not be expected for spl <dig> because its known or predicted splicing variants  do not disrupt the tmd domain. more often, specific proteolytic activities, such as the regulated intramembrane proteolysis  and the rhomboid proteases, produce a cleavage at the vicinity of the tmd  <cit> . however, because the apparent molecular weights of both spl <dig> nuclear and er-attached fragments correspond approximately to half of that of the predicted full-size protein, a proteolytic cleavage in the middle is suggested as the strategy to release and activate spl <dig> . thus, regulated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent processing  and the so-called receptor-activated proteolysis  would be more conceivable for this case  <cit> . nevertheless, we envisage a relative rapid-acting mechanism as the presence of the full-sized gfp::spl <dig> was barely detectable in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and remained even undetectable following biochemical fractionation. consequently, it would be particularly interesting to identify the responsible protease and the cleavage site in spl <dig>  as it will shed more light on the precise mechanism activating spl <dig> and contribute to relate its function to additional biological responses.

the initial location of a likely dormant spl <dig> at the er provides a new perspective on the regulation of cu homeostasis and requires a re-evaluation of the role of the so-called secretory pathway in cu sensing. as represented in figure  <dig>  cu+ imported by the selective cu-transport proteins ctr/copt is bound and further distributed by cu-specific soluble factors or metallochaperones . among them, atx1-like metallochaperones interact with the pb-atpase ccc <dig> in saccharomyces cereviseae, or ran1/hma <dig> in plants, in order to supply cu-proteins en route  <cit> . whereas ccc <dig> resides in the golgi apparatus of yeast, the exact subcellular localization of arabidopsis ran <dig> has not yet been determined. however, since the er-located ethylene receptors  are largely dependent on cu supply by ran <dig>  an er location has been proposed . thus, unlike storage organelles as chloroplasts, mitochondria or vacuoles, the er could act as a more reliable indicator of the steady-state cu availability in the cell.

notably, several studies have recently reported a central role of the er in sensing/transducing cellular stresses  <cit> . in an attempt to identify er perturbations that activate spl <dig>  our initial data suggest an impact in the er protein-folding capacity during cu starvation and how er stress treatments slightly induced selected spl7-targets in mild cu-sufficient seedlings. whether the initial tethering of spl <dig> to the er-membrane could be a cellular strategy to sense cu limitation through the stress it imposes to the er needs to be further investigated. within this context, it is also worth mentioning that the growth inhibitory effect of fumonisin b <dig>  was found attenuated in the fbr <dig> mutant, representing the spl7-related spl <dig> tf  <cit> . the apoptotic effect of the mycotoxin fb <dig> is related to a reduction in the cellular ceramide levels, a likely signal for er-stress . given the conservation of the putative tmd among the large spls including spl <dig>  it would also be interesting to address if the strategy proposed for spl <dig> could be extended to this class of tfs.

on the other hand, given that the spl <dig> orthologs in single-celled algae lack a tmd, this domain could represent an innovation in the evolution of land plants  <cit> . the positive selection of the tmd may be related to the multicellular and more complex nature of land plants, where many different cell types likely differ in their requirements for cu and their demand probably even changes with growth and development. thus, anchoring spl7-like proteins to membranes could play a role in fine-tuning their activities in a more cell-autonomous context. however, although further comparative studies between crr <dig> and spl7-like proteins are required to provide a more thorough answer, the existence of additional regulatory levels for these tfs in higher plants seems likely.

based on our data, we also propose spl <dig> homodimerization as another checkpoint in the regulation of spl <dig> activity. indeed, independent in vivo approaches indicated that the spl <dig> n-terminal half is prone to self-dimerization. accordingly, only spl <dig> protein fragments encompassing at least the conserved signature rxsxklx4px3px2lx7lx7ex3rxgcx3t denoted the irpgc domain , were isolated in a y2h screen using spl <dig> as bait. consequently, this signature could be considered to represent a dimerization domain. homodimer formation involving this domain in the n-terminal half of spl <dig> would also explain our observations on co-immunoprecipitated n-terminal spl <dig> fragments, most likely generated through post-translational processing as discussed above. similarly, only split yfp fragments fused as n-terminal tags to spl <dig> were successful in bifc assays. furthermore, the reconstituted yfp fluorophore signal for n-terminal fusions illuminated the nuclear surroundings and cytoplasmic filaments, in an er-like distribution. however, these results seem to contradict observations on gfp-tagged spl7-like proteins clearly located in the nucleus when overexpressed in heterologous systems . therefore, it is tempting to speculate that spl <dig> preferentially enters the nucleus as a monomer. exclusion of the dimer may be the result of the large size of the protein complex formed or of masking the nls . in addition, rapid degradation or instability of spl <dig> dimers cannot be ruled out as gfp::spl <dig> was not easily detectable outside the nucleus neither in fluorescence microscopy nor in biochemical approaches. hence dimerization, likely promoted by increasing amounts of released spl <dig> protein, may be part of a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate the homeostatic cu deficiency response and eventually avoid spurious effects. interestingly, given the conservation of the irpgc signature not only in spl <dig> orthologous proteins but also in closely related large spls in arabidopsis  <cit> , homodimerization, or even heterodimerization, may represent a more general regulatory feature of this type of sbp-domain tfs.

the participation of additional spl7-interacting proteins in the spl <dig> post-translational regulation mechanism cannot be excluded . indeed, kin <dig> associates with spl <dig> in order to stimulate spl7-targets and counteract the oxidative stress under cu deprivation  <cit> . nevertheless, we are not aware of mutants for other genes with a similar or even close impact on the global response to cu deficiency as spl <dig> mutants have. therefore we assume that the likely spl7-interactome consists of largely functionally redundant components that probably contribute more to refine spl <dig> function, rather than to its activation.

importantly, spl <dig> is expected to undergo a high turnover because different tagged full-sized spl7-like proteins could not be clearly detected in stable transgenics, despite their functionality  and reasonable transgene transcript levels . we also did not succeed to trace spl <dig> in planta by observing different tissues at different time-points or using different tags, growth conditions or protein degradation inhibitors . however, we demonstrated that expression of an n-terminal gfp-tagged spl <dig> fragment including the sbp-domain but lacking the downstream irpgc domain could be detected and resulted in a constitutive spl <dig> function-related response irrespective of the cu availability. a similar behaviour has been reported for other er-attached proteins. a constitutive ethylene triple response is achieved by expressing putative c-terminal ein2-cleaved fragments  <cit> . similarly, the anac017- <dig> mutant, rendering a truncated version of anac <dig> without the tmd, induces its target alternative oxidase <dig> , even in non-h2o2-treated plants  <cit> . remarkably, the constitutive transcriptional activity of spl <dig> targets in spl7-sbp transgenic lines, even during non-physiological cu excess, seem to contradict previous data showing that cu ions negatively interfere the dna-binding capacity of the spl <dig> sbp-domain in vitro  <cit> . one should take into account that cu ions cannot move freely within cells due to the efficient cu-chelating capacity of cells  <cit> . moreover, a direct interaction between spl <dig> and free cu ions seems unlikely because cu is mostly stored in organelles like the chloroplasts and mitochondria, whereas spl <dig> distributes between endomembranes and nucleus. nevertheless, a slight decrease in spl7-targets could be even noticed in the spl7-sbp plants during the transition from cu deficiency to sufficiency. we, therefore, propose that the effect of cu ions on the functionality of spl <dig> is mediated by some interacting factor, such as specific metallochaperones . the respective interacting spl <dig> domain is then most likely c-terminal of the sbp-domain. an overlap with the irpgc domain, as the main conserved signature within this region, cannot be excluded. whether the dimerization through this domain constitutes a possible regulatory mechanism promoting spl <dig> turnover needs to be further addressed.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of the spl <dig> tf in orchestrating cu homeostasis in plants. additionally, the mechanism of action we have reported here for spl <dig> may possibly be extrapolated to other large sbp-domain proteins because a conservation of particular structural features is suggested on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities.
