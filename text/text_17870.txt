BACKGROUND
under anaerobic conditions escherichia coli synthesizes three membrane-associated -hydrogenases , although its genome has the capacity to encode four of these enzymes  <cit> . hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> are respiratory hydrogenases with their active sites facing the periplasm and the structural subunits of these are encoded within the hya and hyb operons  <cit> , respectively. the physiological role of both enzymes is to couple hydrogen oxidation to the reduction of the quinone pool in the inner membrane, and they can be readily isolated and characterised in an active form  <cit> . hyd- <dig> is an oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase while hyd- <dig> is a ‘standard’ oxygen-sensitive enzyme  <cit>  and it has been proposed that hyd- <dig> functions at more positive redox potentials, which are found at the aerobic-anaerobic interface  <cit> .

hyd- <dig> is encoded by the hyc operon  <cit>  and forms a key component of the formate hydrogenlyase  complex, which is predicted to be associated with the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and catalyses hydrogen and carbon dioxide production from formate. expression of fhl is maximal under fermentative conditions in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors and is absolutely dependent on formate  <cit> . hyd- <dig> is considered a labile hydrogenase that has so far proven recalcitrant to isolation in an active form  <cit> . the labile molybdenum- and selenium-dependent formate dehydrogenase-h  is also associated with the fhl complex  <cit> . fdh-h represents one of the three formate dehydrogenase enzymes in e. coli   <cit> . fdh-o and fdh-n are membrane-bound and periplasmically-oriented respiratory enzymes that couple formate oxidation to quinone reduction and thus contribute directly to energy conservation.

several methods have been described for visualizing the redox activity of hydrogenases. most commonly, low-potential artificial redox-active viologen dyes such as methyl viologen  and benzyl viologen  have been used  <cit> . all three e. coli hydrogenases can couple h <dig> oxidation to bv reduction in vitro and when extracts from fermentatively-grown cells are assayed hyd- <dig> can contribute over 90% to the total activity  <cit> . while hyd-1- and hyd-2-catalysed bv reduction can be readily visualised and the enzymes distinguished by use of an in-gel assay  <cit> , hyd- <dig> activity has so far proved recalcitrant to zymographic identification and this had been thought to be due to the instability of the large fhl complex . moreover, the large respiratory fdh-n and fdh-o enzyme complexes also contribute some background staining due to their inherent h2:bv oxidoreductase activities, thus making any assessment of a hyd- <dig> associated activity potentially problematic  <cit> . alternative hydrogenase assays have been developed for other biological systems. for example, the oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases from ralstonia eutropha h <dig> can be visualized with phenazine methosulfate /nitroblue tetrazolium   <cit>  or pms/triphenyl tetrazolium chloride   <cit>  combinations of redox dyes. methylene blue has also been used extensively in hydrogenase research  <cit> . however, the use of alternative redox-active electron acceptors has not really been extensively explored for the hydrogenases of e. coli.

the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the differential activities of the e. coli hydrogenases with a view to making it possible to distinguish all enzymes synthesized under anaerobic growth conditions. we describe here conditions that allow the unequivocal visualization of all three, membrane-associated, anaerobically inducible hydrogenase enzyme complexes.

RESULTS
identification of hyd- <dig> activity through an in-gel assay
hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> are readily visualized after gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions in a high-ph buffering system  <cit> . through the use of defined hydrogenase structural gene mutants it is possible to identify which hydrogenase enzyme is responsible for which activity band and this is exemplified in figure  <dig>  hyd- <dig> migrates as a single, fast-migrating activity band and introduction of a mutation in the hyab gene, encoding the large subunit, abolished activity . hyd- <dig>  on the other hand, migrates as two more slowly-migrating activity bands and these are no longer detectable in hybc deletion mutant . through the analysis of defined mutants lacking all  <dig> hydrogenases, it has been shown recently that the respiratory fdh-n and fdh-o enzymes also exhibit a h2:bv oxidoreductase activity, thus potentially defining a new class of hydrogenase  <cit> . the weak hydrogenase activity due to fdh-n and fdh-o is clearly visible in a crude extract derived from strain hdk <dig>  which lacks functional hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> enzymes . no other h2:bv oxidoreductase enzyme activity is discernible under the conditions used in the experiment shown in figure  <dig> 

the conditions under which activity-staining is normally carried out involve long incubation times and a gas atmosphere of ≥ 95% nitrogen/≤ 5% hydrogen  <cit> . because the hyd- <dig> enzyme component of the fhl complex normally catalyzes proton reduction rather than hydrogen oxidation in vivo and the spectrophotometric assay of this enzyme typically involves using saturating hydrogen concentrations, and consequently a very low redox potential in the assay, we decided to perform an in-gel activity stain under a 100% hydrogen gas atmosphere. surprisingly, after exposure for only  <dig> minutes  a prominent and highly active, high molecular weight complex showing h2:bv oxidoreductase activity appeared when the native gel was incubated in the presence of a 100% hydrogen atmosphere . although active hyd- <dig> could also be detected, no activity bands corresponding to either hyd- <dig> or the fdh-n/o enzymes were observed under these conditions. the activity of this high-molecular weight complex was shown to be dependent on the presence of the hyc genes, as it was absent in extracts of strains cp <dig> , ftd <dig>  and ftd <dig>  . these data suggest strongly that the high molecular weight hydrogenase activity band corresponds minimally to the hyd- <dig> component of the fhl complex, and perhaps even to the intact fhl complex. as mentioned above, it is well documented that hyd- <dig> catalyzes hydrogen oxidation in vitro and can contribute ~ 90% of total hydrogen oxidation activity measured in crude extracts derived from fermentatively-grown cells  <cit> .

fdh-h is required to stabilize hyd- <dig> but is not essential for activity
because the fhl complex comprises not only hyd- <dig> but also fdh-h, it was necessary to determine whether the fdh-h component was required for the visualization of the hyd- <dig> activity. analysis of extracts derived from strains devoid either of the respiratory formate dehydrogenases, fdh-o and fdh-n, , or the biosynthetic accessory protein fdhe involved in their assembly   <cit> , clearly showed that the hyd- <dig> activity band had similar intensity to that in the wild-type . however, when the fdhf gene encoding fdh-h was deleted either alone , or in combination with fdhe , the intensity of the hyd- <dig> activity band was significantly reduced . a similar result was observed when a crude extract derived from the selc mutant fm <dig>  which cannot synthesize selenoproteins  <cit> , was analysed. if membrane-associated, it would be expected that fdh-h migrates together with hyd- <dig> as part of a large fhl complex. in-gel formate-dependent bv reduction was therefore tested with the same samples of crude extracts. following 16 h incubation with formate and bv/ttc under a n <dig> atmosphere two bands showing formate:bv oxidoreductase activity were observed, which migrated slightly more slowly that the hyd- <dig> activity and with a much sharper banding pattern . however, as these activity bands were clearly visible in an fdhf deletion strain , they could not be attributable to fdh-h . rather, the fact that they were absent in extracts derived from fm <dig> , mutants cpd <dig> and cpd <dig>  both devoid of fdhe, and mutant cpd <dig> unable to synthesize the fdh-n and fdh-o enzymes, this indicates that these activities were due to the respiratory formate dehydrogenases . taken together, these findings indicate that fdh-h does not appear to co-migrate with hyd- <dig> in an enzymically active form. despite the fact that the fdh-h component of the fhl complex does not appear to be associated with the hyd- <dig> enzyme complex after electrophoretic separation in the gel system used and is not absolutely essential for visualization of hyd- <dig> activity, it nevertheless appears to be required to stabilize the active complex.

the large hyd- <dig> protein complex is active in a neutral ph gel-system and is membrane-associated
the total hydrogen-oxidizing activity measureable in crude extracts of fermentatively grown e. coli cells is stable over a broad range of ph but above ph  <dig> the activity is rapidly lost  <cit> . to determine whether hyd- <dig> activity is detectable also after electrophoresis in a neutral ph buffer system, crude extracts of the strains cp <dig> , cpd <dig>  and cpd <dig>  were analysed in a tris-barbitone ph  <dig> buffer system  <cit> . the activity of hyd- <dig> could be clearly observed as a single, large, slowly-migrating complex . once again, while the fdh-h component was not absolutely essential for activity to be observed, hyd- <dig> activity was significantly reduced in a mutant unable to synthesize the enzyme. it was noted that in the neutral ph buffer system the intensity of the hyd- <dig> activity bands was much higher after exposure to hydrogen for 10 min than at high ph where it was not detectable in this time-frame . this is probably due to the fact that hyd- <dig> is slowly inactivated by exposure to high ph buffer  <cit> . hyd- <dig> activity, in contrast, showed the opposite effect of being more active at high ph and less active in the neutral ph gel-system.

the fhl complex is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and the active site of each enzyme component  faces the cytoplasm  <cit> . to determine whether the hyd- <dig> activity identified in this study was membrane-associated the crude extracts derived from anaerobically grown wild-type , cp <dig>  and cpd <dig>  were separated into soluble and membrane fractions and an aliquot of each was separated in the high-ph gel-system and stained for hyd- <dig> activity in an atmosphere of 100% hydrogen . the results clearly demonstrate that hyd- <dig> activity, along with that attributable to hyd- <dig>  was membrane-associated.

high hydrogen partial pressure facilitates detection of hyd- <dig> activity after native-page
no hyd- <dig> enzyme activity is detectable after non-denaturing page if the hydrogen concentration in the gaseous phase approximates 5%  or below . to provide an estimate of the minimal h <dig> concentration in the gas headspace required to visualize hyd- <dig> activity, we separated extracts derived from cp <dig>  and cpd <dig>  in native-page and incubated these with different concentrations of h <dig> in the headspace . the results clearly show that from a concentration of 25% h <dig> in the gas phase  hyd- <dig> activity was detectable. the intensity of the hyd- <dig> activity also remained comparatively constant at the different high hydrogen concentrations . in contrast, the intensity of the hyd- <dig> activity bands decreased with increasing hydrogen gas concentration, suggesting an inverse correlation between hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activities exists at high hydrogen gas concentration when bv is used as electron acceptor. we determined the redox potential  of the bv/ttc assay buffer with 5% hydrogen in the headspace to be -264 mv and with 100% in the headspace to be -322 mv .

a the concentrations of bv and ttc were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

b the concentrations of pms and nbt were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively.

c measured at 25 °c and 1 atm. pressure. 0% hydrogen indicates measurements were made in air. note that all measurements were made twice.

hyd- <dig> catalyzes the hydrogen-dependent reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium
through the analysis of extracts derived from anaerobically grown e. coli strains specifically unable to synthesize hyd- <dig> , hyd- <dig> , hyd- <dig> , hyd-1/hyd- <dig>  or all three -hydrogenases , it was shown that only strains able to synthesize hyd- <dig> were capable of reducing nitroblue tetrazolium  in a hydrogen-dependent manner . notably, intensely stained activity bands of hyd- <dig> were observed after only 5 min incubation with 5% h <dig> in the gas phase. the redox potential of the assay buffer in the presence of 5% headspace hydrogen was determined to be – 38 mv , decreasing to – 98 mv with 100% hydrogen in the headspace. hyd- <dig> was unable to reduce nbt even after an incubation period of 3 h, as only hyd- <dig> was visualized for the wild-type mc <dig> . incubation for 16 h did not alter this pattern of staining . equally, hyd- <dig> was also incapable of transferring electrons to nbt . similarly, deletion of the genes coding for the putative hyd- <dig> enzyme  <cit>  in strain ftd <dig> also did not result in a different pattern from strain ftd <dig>  which suggests that hyd- <dig> is not active under the conditions tested.

to analyse the specificity of the apparent hyd-1-dependent nbt stain, the strain fm <dig>  was employed and a crude extract derived from this strain displayed a hyd- <dig> activity band of similar intensity to that in mc <dig> but the extract lacked the slower migrating activity band confirming that this was due to fdh-n and fdh-o , as previously reported  <cit> . a selc mutant is incapable of incorporating selenocysteine into proteins and so lacks all formate dehydrogenase activity  <cit> . moreover, strains cpd <dig> and cpd <dig>  both carrying a deletion in fdhe, and strain cpd <dig>  which carries deletions in the genes encoding the large subunit of fdh-n and fdh-o  also lacked the fdh-n and fdh-o activity bands, as anticipated. taken together, the fast-migrating, h2-dependent nbt-reducing activity band shown here is not linked to formate dehydrogenase activity and is hyd- <dig> 

as a final control, we replaced the electron donor h <dig> with formate, the usual substrate of the formate dehydrogenases. the only activity detectable after native-page and staining was that due to fdh-n and fdh-o  and this activity was absent in extracts of strain fm <dig> .

reduction of nbt by hyd- <dig> variants with amino acid exchanges in the supernumerary cysteines near the proximal  cluster
of the three hydrogenases synthesized in anaerobically growing e. coli cells only hyd- <dig> can reduce nbt in a hydrogen-dependent manner. one of the major differences between hyd- <dig> and the other enzymes is its oxygen tolerance  <cit> . the current proposed reason for the high oxygen tolerance exhibited by hyd- <dig> is the unusual proximal -cluster, along with two additional cysteinyl residues in the immediate environment around the cluster  <cit> . indeed, recent site-specific mutagenesis experiments have identified cys- <dig> as being particularly important for conferring oxygen-tolerance to the enzyme, because when substituted by glycine it generates an active hyd- <dig> variant that is oxygen-sensitive  <cit> . in order to test whether the supernumerary cysteinyl residues  are important for the ability of hyd- <dig> to reduce nbt, we examined the h2-dependent nbt-reduction activity of extracts derived from strains encoding the hyaa small-subunit variants c19g and c120g variants of hyd- <dig>  <cit> . all hyd- <dig> variants present in crude extracts from anaerobically grown cells retained the ability to reduce both nbt and bv/ttc in the presence of hydrogen, indicating that the substitution of neither cys- <dig> nor cys- <dig> affects electron-transfer to the artificial electron acceptors .

the core catalytic dimer of hyd- <dig> reacts with nbt
recent studies have shown that the small subunit of the e. coli hydrogenases must form a complex with the large subunit for electron transfer from hydrogen to bv to occur  <cit> . although not yet unequivocally demonstrated, it is conceivable that the artificial electron acceptors bv and nbt receive electrons directly from one of the -clusters in the hyaa small subunit of hyd- <dig>  the hyaa small subunit of the core catalytic hyaab dimer of hyd- <dig>  when correctly assembled in the membrane, conducts electrons through a -cluster relay between the active site within the large subunit and a proximal b-type heme located within a membrane-integral cytochrome b subunit . this is different for hyd- <dig>  because there is no hyac equivalent and instead the small subunit hybo interacts with an additional  cluster-containing subunit, hyba, and the hybb integral membrane protein  <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that nbt receives electrons from the cytochrome b subunit hyac and not from hyaa. to test this a hexa-histidine affinity tagged variant of hyd- <dig>  <cit>  was isolated from the membrane fraction of anaerobically grown fth <dig>  since the hyac subunit is only loosely bound to hyd- <dig> in detergent, this allows the isolation of the active, core heterodimer comprising hyab and hyaa. the authenticity of the purified his-tagged hyd- <dig> enzyme was verified by western blot detection using anti-hyd- <dig> antibodies  and the quality of the purified enzyme was analysed by coomassie brilliant blue staining . native electrophoresis followed by activity staining with hydrogen and nbt revealed that the core heterodimer retained both nbt-  and bv/ttc-reducing  activities after native-page. therefore, it can be concluded that membrane-anchoring subunit hyac is not required for electron-transfer to nbt.

discussion
tetrazolium-based redox dyes are useful tools in zymographic detection of oxidoreductase enzyme activity in non-denaturing page because upon irreversible reduction they generate coloured, insoluble formazan complexes, which are advantageous in cumulative staining procedures. triphenyl tetrazolium has been used for a considerable time as a means of distinguishing the hydrogenase enzymes in e. coli cell extracts  <cit> . measuring hyd- <dig> activity in the presence of the h2-oxidizing enzymes was problematic in the past and visualizing it had not been successfully accomplished until the current study was conducted. however, optimization of the in-gel assay conditions, together with the judicious use of defined mutants has allowed us for the first time to visualize hyd- <dig> activity unequivocally after native-page. the complexes exhibiting hyd- <dig> activity migrate in native-page at high molecular masses, similar to the trimer of trimers of the fdh-n and fdh-o with a mass of 500-550 kda  <cit> . this suggests that the stoichiometry of the individual components in the fhl complex might be greater than unity. nothing is currently known about the stoichiometry of the fhl complex components or the architecture of the hyce/hycg large and small subunit within the complex, and this will form the subject of future studies.

the findings of the current study suggest that while the fdh-h component of the fhl complex is required for maximal activity of the complex, in its absence activity of the hyd- <dig> can still be detected and its migration position in the gel system is very similar in extracts of the wild-type and the fdhf mutant. this suggests perhaps that the fdh-h component is separated from the rest of the complex during electrophoresis. the lability of the fdh-h activity has been noted previously  <cit> .

one possible reason why the hyd- <dig> activity was previously overlooked after in-gel staining is the considerable overlap in the staining pattern of fdh-n/o, hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  alternatively, reliable detection of hyd- <dig> activity appears to require hydrogen concentrations of minimally 5% in the gas phase and many of our previous studies used lower concentrations  <cit> . using high concentrations of hydrogen in the staining procedure has the advantage that hyd- <dig> activity is detectable after a few minutes’ exposure, while hyd- <dig> is not detectable under these conditions, possibly due to the low abundance of the enzyme in extracts of e. coli coupled with the brief exposure to hydrogen. hyd- <dig>  like hyd- <dig>  is a more abundant enzyme and this possibly explains the rapid visualization of both these enzymes after only 10 min exposure to high hydrogen concentrations.

the fact that the fhl complex is active in h <dig> oxidation contrasts the physiological direction of the reaction in the e. coli cell. this, therefore, might be an explanation for the comparatively high h <dig> concentrations required to drive the reaction in the direction of hydrogen oxidation. the similar redox potentials of formate and hydrogen do, however, indicate that this reaction should be freely reversible, possibly pointing to a role of a progenitor of the fhl complex in co <dig> fixation  <cit> .

another possible explanation for the effect of hydrogen concentration on hyd- <dig> activity is that high hydrogen concentrations drive the redox potential of a solution to more negative eh values  <cit> . for example a 100% hydrogen atmosphere will result in a eh = -420 mv in anaerobic cultures, while a 5% hydrogen concentration in the headspace equates to a redox potential of around -370 mv and a dissolved hydrogen concentration in cultures of maximally 40 μm at 25°c  <cit> .

our recent studies have shown that the -cluster-containing small subunit of the hydrogenase must be associated with the large subunit in order for hydrogen-dependent bv reduction to occur  <cit> . it is possible that bv receives electrons from a  cluster. if this is the case, then hydrogen-dependent bv reduction by a component of hyd- <dig> also possibly occurs via a  cluster; however, due to the considerable number of  cluster-containing subunits in the complex  future studies will be required to elucidate whether bv can interact with one or several sites in the complex.

the use of the electron acceptor nbt enabled a clear distinction between hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig> activities. previous experiments have shown that pms/nbt staining is sometimes non-specific due to interaction with protein-bound sulfhydryl groups and even bsa was shown to be capable of staining gels incubated with pms/nbt  <cit> . we could clearly show in this study, however, that, of the hydrogenases in e. coli, only hyd- <dig> was capable of the specific, hydrogen-dependent reduction of pms/nbt. notably, both respiratory fdhs also showed a strong nbt-reducing activity, which correlates well with previous findings for these enzymes  <cit> .

hyd- <dig> is similar to the oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases of r. eutropha and it is equipped with two supernumerary cysteinyl residues, which coordinate the proximal -cluster  <cit> . pms-mediated staining has been previously used for the oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases from r. eutropha <cit> , which led to the suggestion that particular structural features of oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases accounted for the differences in dye-reducing activity of the oxygen-tolerant and sensitive enzymes. the supernumerary cys- <dig> of the small subunit, when exchanged for a glycine was shown to convert hyd- <dig> from an oxygen-tolerant to an oxygen-sensitive enzyme  <cit> . this amino acid exchange did not affect nbt reduction in our assay system, thus indicating that the oxygen-tolerance is not the sole reason for the ability of hyd- <dig> to reduce nbt. this finding is also in agreement with the recent observation that the exchange of the supernumerary cysteines does not affect the catalytic bias of hyd- <dig> to function in hydrogen-oxidation  <cit> . the structural and electronic properties of hyd- <dig>  <cit>  probably govern its ability to transfer electrons from hydrogen to comparatively high-potential redox dyes such as nbt . the similar redox potential of nbt in our assay buffer with and without pms , indicates that hyd- <dig> should reduce nbt directly, which is indeed what we have observed .

neither hyd- <dig> nor hyd- <dig> can reduce nbt and this is presumably because they function optimally at very low redox potentials, although potential steric effects restricting interaction of the enzymes with the dye cannot be totally excluded at this stage. hyd- <dig> is a classical hydrogen-oxidizing enzyme that functions optimally at redox potentials lower than - <dig> to -150 mv  <cit> . the combined inclusion of bv  and ttc , along with 5% hydrogen in the headspace, of the assay was sufficient to maintain a low redox potential to detect hyd- <dig> readily. this also explains why long incubation times are required for visualization of hyd- <dig> activity with the bv/ttc assay. increasing the hydrogen concentration in the assay to 100% drives the redox potential below -320 mv and explains why the hyd- <dig> activity was readily detectable at hydrogen concentrations above 25% .

in stark contrast to hyd- <dig> and hyd- <dig>  hyd- <dig> shows a high activity at redox potentials above -100 mv  <cit> . in the assay system used in this study, the presence of nbt in the buffer system resulted in a redox potential of -65 mv in the presence 5% hydrogen and -92 mv when the hydrogen concentration was 100%, both of which are optimal for hyd- <dig> activity and well above that where the hyd- <dig> is enzymically active  <cit> . placed in a cellular context, this agrees perfectly with the roles of hyd- <dig> in coupling hydrogen oxidation to fumarate reduction, of hyd- <dig> in scavenging hydrogen during microaerobiosis and of hyd- <dig> in functioning at very low redox potentials in proton reduction  <cit> . this allows the bacterium to conduct its hydrogen metabolism over a very broad range of redox potentials.

CONCLUSIONS
using increased partial pressure of dihydrogen in combination with the artificial electron acceptor combination benzyl viologen/triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, we defined conditions allowing the identification of an active hyd- <dig> enzyme complex after non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. moreover, by substituting bv/ttc with nitroblue tetrazolium as an electron acceptor we could demonstrate that only the oxygen-tolerant hyd- <dig> enzyme could catalyse hydrogen-dependent dye reduction, suggesting that this facile assay could be used to identify oxygen-tolerant hydrogenases in other microorganisms. however, the ability of hyd- <dig> to reduce nbt was not dependent on the oxygen-tolerance of the enzyme because an oxygen-sensitive hyd- <dig> variant in which the supernumerary cys- <dig> was substituted by gly retained the ability to reduce the redox dye.
