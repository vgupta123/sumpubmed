BACKGROUND
coral reefs are fascinating ecosystems, characterized by high levels of biodiversity and ecological complexity, high primary productivity and have significant aesthetic and commercial value, particularly in relation to fisheries, tourism and the aquarium industry. in recent decades coral reefs have been dramatically impacted by large-scale disturbances  <cit> . natural disturbances are a routine part of coral reef community dynamics, but they have increased in frequency and severity during the last three decades  <cit> . in addition to providing multiple sources of anthropogenic disturbance that directly kill coral colonies  <cit> , human activities have likely contributed to the increase in natural disturbances via global warming.

of the broad range of natural and anthropogenic perturbations that affect coral reefs, coral bleaching is recognised as a major disturbance that has the potential to significantly alter the biological and ecological processes that maintain reef communities  <cit> . this phenomenon can occur from the colony scale to the geographical scale where it leads to "mass" coral bleaching with occasional high mortality rates. for example, in  <dig> a global mass coral bleaching event led to the death of 16% of the worlds corals  <cit> .

physiologically, this phenomenon is due to the breakdown of the phototrophic mutualistic symbiosis between scleractinian corals and dinoflagellate endosymbionts , commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. this symbiosis breakdown can be the consequence of a large variety of environmental stressors  <cit> , but one of the most important for mass coral bleaching is abnormal high sea surface temperatures which can act synergistically with high solar irradiance  <cit> . at the cellular level, coral bleaching refers to a substantial or partial loss of the endosymbiotic algae from the coral tissues, and/or the loss or reduction of photosynthetic pigment concentrations within zooxanthellae  <cit> .

at the molecular level, the first step of temperature or light induced coral bleaching is the photoinhibition mechanism experienced by the zooxanthellae  <cit> . this often results in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species  by transport chain electrons  <cit> . ros are highly cytotoxic and some of them can easily cross biological membranes leading to severe oxidative stress in both host and symbiotic cells. this oxidative stress can result in the activation of cell necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> , which represent two of the six identified ways of endosymbiotic loss during bleaching  <cit> . the four other ways of symbiont disappearance are: i) in situ digestion of zooxanthellae by the coral host  <cit> , ii) expulsion by exocytosis or iii) by pinching off  <cit> , and iv) host cell detachment  <cit> .

the increase in the incidence and magnitude of coral bleaching episodes in recent decades  <cit>  and the present context of global warming  <cit>  strengthens the interest in this research field. studies on early molecular mechanisms triggering and leading to these different ways of symbiotic loss are necessary to better understand the phenomenon and can provide early molecular markers to monitor coral health. in this context, several comparative molecular studies were undertaken. they compared healthy, semi-bleached and bleached corals or symbiotic versus aposymbiotic anemones. these studies revealed different genes involved in the response to the stress as well as genes putatively involved in bleaching mechanism or symbiosis breakdown/onset  <cit> . some of the genes identified in these different studies are promising candidates to explain bleaching processes but studies on their expression and function are now necessary to validate their putative role. for example, a recent study of desalvo et al.  evidenced a putative calcium homeostasis disruption that could trigger different cellular processes leading to cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. concerning symbiosis regulation, sym  <dig>  a fasciclin domain containing protein, was shown to be differentially expressed between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones, could be involved in host/symbiont interaction and symbiosis breakdown under cadmium exposure  <cit> .

in the present study, the experiment was specifically designed to identify genes regulated in the early stages of the thermal stress process leading to bleaching. to achieve this aim, we developed a comparative transcriptomic approach  comparing stressed corals before bleaching symptoms appears versus controls. because our aim was also to develop functional markers that could be used to monitor coral health, we choose pocillopora damicornis as a model species due to its widespread distribution in the indo-pacific region  <cit>  and its high sensitivity during mass bleaching events  <cit> . our ssh approach led to the identification of two genes displaying an important down-regulation just before bleaching. characterization of their precursors and immunolocalization experiments revealed their putative function and permitted the emergence of new hypotheses on coral bleaching mechanisms. in addition, these two genes constitute promising biomarkers for coral health monitoring.

RESULTS
bleaching monitoring
zooxanthellae density and statistical tests  showed that bleaching occurred in the stressed set of corals at 32째c,  <dig> days after the beginning of the protocol and was complete by the 18th day. in the control set, no bleaching or paling was observed throughout the experiment. after  <dig> days at 32째c, bleaching induced a large increase in the standard deviation  of zooxanthellae density in comparison to the other points of the kinetic, suggesting that symbiosis in some corals was starting to break. bleaching was well-established  <dig> days after the beginning of the protocol with a  <dig> % reduction in zooxanthellae density.

in order to select genes regulated early during bleaching, we performed the ssh with samples taken at day  <dig> and  <dig>  this choice was also driven by an experimental constraint whereby stressed and control samples must have similar zooxanthellae densities to avoid false positive transcripts due to a differential representation of zooxanthellae between the two conditions.

est sequencing, general characteristics of the big and brg libraries, gene validation and selection
two ssh experiments were performed resulting in the construction of four cdna libraries. the first ssh experiment was the result of the subtractive hybridization between the 31째c  and control sets, and the second experiment between the 32째c  and control sets. one hundred clones from each library were sequenced. to simplify the analysis, putative induced clones and putative repressed clones of the ssh libraries were respectively pooled in two new libraries called "bleaching induced genes"  and "bleaching repressed genes" . after sequencing,  <dig> and  <dig> high quality cdna sequences were obtained from the big and the brg libraries, respectively. big library ests coalesced into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, suggesting that the overall redundancy of the library was about  <dig> % . the brg library coalesced into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons for an overall redundancy of  <dig> % . in order to minimize redundancy in the est database, sequences displaying 100% identity were submitted as a single sequence. ests aligning in the same contig but displaying differences in their nucleotidic sequence were submitted individually to the database. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ests were submitted to the dbest section of the ncbi/genbank database for the big and brg libraries respectively . ests were subjected to blastn and blastx searches. sequence similarities were considered to be significant when the expected value  was less than 10- <dig>  gene encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis, oxidative detoxification, intracellular signalling pathway, metabolism, cytoskeleton structure, conserved protein domains, calcium homeostasis, cell/cell or cell/ligand interactions, protein degradation, chaperone protein and protein synthesis were selected for further analysis . among the tested clusters , only clusters  <dig> and  <dig> showed a drastic regulation. they display  <dig> and  <dig>  fold transcript decreases under stress, respectively.

clusters  <dig> and  <dig> belong to the functional class of cell/cell or cell/ligand interaction and their putative functions make them promising candidates as key factors of symbiosis breakdown/maintenance. consequently, we decided to focus the remainder of the present study on these genes.

cluster  <dig> and  <dig> orf characterization and protein structure
race-pcr experiments were performed to obtain the complete orf of the two selected genes. the cdna corresponding to cluster  <dig> displayed significant similarities  with a predicted protein of nematostella vectensis. the precursor displays a cysteine array  shared by snake toxins and some proteins involved in cell adhesion . this gene was named pdcyst-rich, for pocillopora damicornis cystein-rich. the second gene  displayed significant similarities  for the millectin protein, isolated from acropora millepora  <cit> . domain analysis using the interproscan software showed that this protein contained a dc-sign domain characteristic for lectins of the c-type. consequently, this gene was named pdc-lectin.

cdna corresponding to pdcyst-rich  displays an orf of  <dig> base pairs corresponding to a precursor of  <dig> amino acids . the analysis of the primary structure by psortii prediction software reveals that it has a secretory protein-like structure with a  <dig> peptide signal sequence. between the residue  <dig> and  <dig> of the precursor a domain similar to the upar/ly6/cd59/snake toxin family was identified using the interproscan software. the size range of this domain is comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> aa  <cit> . this type of domain is present in a large variety of proteins involved in different functions, including t-lymphocyte activation , fibrinogen formation , inhibition of the complement mediating lysis  and snake venom  <cit> . the principal structural features of this domain are the presence of   <dig> to  <dig> cysteine residues involved in di-sulphide bond formation, and  a typical motif "ccxxdxcn" at the c-terminal end of the domain  <cit> . as the proteins sharing the upar/ly6/cd59/snake toxin domain are classically n-glycosylated and gpi anchored, the n-glycosylation and gpi anchored status of the pdcyst-rich protein were investigated using netglyc and psort <dig> software  <cit> . the n-glycosilation site was predicted on the 75th residue of the precursor and a gpi anchored signal was found at the c-terminal end of the protein .

cdna corresponding to pdc-lectin  displayed an orf of  <dig> base pairs corresponding to a precursor of  <dig> amino acids . the analysis of the primary structure by psortii prediction software revealed that it has a secretory protein-like structure with a  <dig> aa peptide signal sequence. the following  <dig> aa corresponded to a c-type lectin-like domain  shared by a large group of extracellular metazoan proteins  <cit> . this domain is involved in recognition and binding of carbohydrates in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit> . the alignment of pdc-lectin with the most similar ctld , showed the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues . these residues are involved in the three dimensional structure by di-sulphide bond formation. c <dig>  and c <dig>  link 棺 <dig> and 慣 <dig> , and c <dig>  and c <dig>  link 棺 <dig> and 棺 <dig>   <cit> . the "wigl" motif present between the residues  <dig> and  <dig> is involved in the formation of all tree hydrophobic cores and contributes to structure stabilisation  <cit> . the presence of all conserved motif and key residues underlines the hypothesis that pdc-lectin ctld is functional  <cit> . the highly conserved motifs "epn" and "wnd" in the ctld  argue in favour of the specificity for mannose binding in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit> . in addition, the modweb server  <cit>  was used to perform the homology modelling of pdc-lectin. it provides a molecular model based on the crystal structure of the human dc-signr carbohydrate recognition domain   <cit>  and presented a model-score of  <dig>  . the molecular model  revealed that all residues involved in the binding of mannose in a ca2+-dependent manner  are located in similar structures . moreover, the four conserved cysteines and the "wigl" motif known to be involved in the maintenance of the ctld fold have a conserved position in the 3d structure . the differences  which can be observed between the template and the molecular model are located in regions of the molecule that are not considered as essential for function .

expression rates of pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich in comparison to classical indicators of bleaching
q-rt-pcr were performed on rna extracted from coral nubbins sampled at 28째c , 31째c  and 32째c  of the kinetic to follow the transcript variations corresponding to pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich during the stress protocol . transcript amounts were expressed as a relative ratio to the control values obtained at 28째c . for both genes, although zooxanthellae densities were stable until day  <dig> , transcript decreases were observed after  <dig> days . indeed,  <dig> and  <dig>  fold decreases were measured on the 12th day  of the protocol for pdcyst-rich and pdc-lectin genes. at 32째c , the zooxanthellae decrease was non-significant and the levels of pdcyst-rich and pdc-lectin transcripts remained low .

in conclusion, these two genes were drastically down regulated at least six days before the first usual symptoms of bleaching .

genes corresponding to pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich are expressed by coral cells
in order to determine the organism  expressing each candidate gene we developed cross pcr experiments performed on dna extracted from the holobiont  and from pure cultured symbiodinium spp. . these pcr were performed with oligonucleotides specifically amplifying both genes of interest and symbiodinium spp. specific primers  identified in a previous study  <cit>  and known to amplify small ribosomal subunit rna. whereas primers specific to genes encoding pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich proteins only amplified dna extracted from holobionts , ss5z and ss3z primers amplified all dna tested . this last result demonstrated that pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich protein corresponding genes are specific for corals and confirmed similarity results obtained after database comparisons .

immunolocalization of pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich proteins
in order to further examine the location of pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich proteins within coral tissues, antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides designed from pdc-lectin and pdcyst-rich primary structures. initially, the specificity of the antibodies was tested by western blot experiments on holobiont extracts which revealed a single band in both cases .

in order to help the reader interpret immunolabeling observations, a schematic representation of the anatomy and histology of p. damicornis is provided in figure  <dig>  p. damicornis is a colonial coral characterized by the presence of numerous polyps, linked together by a common tissue usually referred to as the coenosarc . in the polyps, the tentacles are only composed of oral tissue  whereas the coenosarc is composed of oral and the aboral tissues . each of these tissues is composed of an ectoderm separated from the endoderm by an acellular layer of mesoglea . the oral endoderm faces the coelenteron  and contains intracellular symbionts commonly called zooxanthellae. the aboral ectoderm faces the skeleton, is composed of calicoblastic cells and is referred to as the calicoblastic ectoderm or calicodermis.

immunolabeling with anti-pdc-lectin and anti-pdcyst-rich protein antibodies is shown in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> . distinct tissues were immunolabeled: anti-pdc-lectin antibodies labeled the oral endoderm containing intracellular zooxanthellae  whereas anti-pdcyst-rich antibody labeled the aboral ectoderm . when tissues were observed at higher magnification, the immunolabeling with anti- pdc-lectin antibodies showed a peripheral pattern adjacent to or in the cellular membrane of the endoderm in contact with the coelenteron . immunolabeling appeared clearly associated with the membranes  and to granular structures located next to the membranes . additionally, in some cases the labeling was observed at the interface between free zooxanthellae and endodermal host coral cells .

anti-pdcyst-rich antibodies labeled the calicoblastic ectoderm  which faced the skeleton in calcified samples. at higher magnifications, it appeared that the immunolabeling of calicoblastic cells was granular and intracellular .

the specificity of the immunolabeling was checked by pre-adsorption of anti-pdc-lectin and anti-pdcyst-rich protein igg with the corresponding synthetic peptides used for immunizations. after this treatment, sections of tissues were no longer labeled  demonstrating the specificity of the immunolabeling.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to identify molecular actors involved in the breakdown of the phototrophic mutualistic symbiosis between a scleractinian coral  and its dinoflagellate endosymbiont  during thermal stress. in contrast to some previous studies, thermal stress conditions used in the present work corresponded to natural conditions in terms of amplitude and rapidity of temperature increase. after ssh and validation steps, two genes belonging to the functional classes of cell/cell or cell/ligand interaction present an important down-regulation. their down-regulation and putative function make them very promising candidates as key indicators of symbiosis breakdown/onset. consequently, we decided to focus the remainder of the present study on these genes.

the first gene, pdcyst-rich, displayed significant similarities with a predicted protein of nematostella vectensis. their complete orf characterization revealed that its precursor displays a putative signal of secretion and all key features shared by the upar/ly6/cd59/snake toxin family. as this domain is common to proteins involved in a large variety of functions, structural elements are not sufficient to provide hypotheses about the function of pdcyst-rich. pcr experiments revealed that the corresponding gene is expressed in coral cells and complementary immunolocalization experiments showed that the protein displays a granular location in the calicoblastic ectoderm in contact with the skeleton. as pdcyst-rich proteins are synthesized and stored in granules of this skeletogenic tissue, we investigated the suspected role of proteins of the upar/ly6/cd59/snake toxin family in mineralization process. two proteins were interesting in this context: robo- <dig>  <cit>  and hep <dig>  <cit> . the function of these proteins remains elusive but their involvement in mineralization process of bones and eggs was hypothesized  <cit> . all these data taken together and in particular the granular location of pdcyst-rich proteins in calicoblastic cells, suggests that pdcyst-rich proteins could also play a role in the mineralization process. as it was shown that stress has an immediate effect triggering growth and calcification arrest in scleractinian corals  <cit> , the strong decrease of the transcript corresponding to pdcyst-rich protein could reflect the trade-off mechanism occurring during stress and leading to the arrest of the mineralization process. a recent transcriptomic study analyzing differential gene expression during thermal stress in m. faveolata also provides evidence of transcript decreases of genes involved in calcification  <cit> .

the second gene identified in the present study was named pdc-lectin. it contains a putative signal peptide and a c-type lectin-like domain shared by a large group of extracellular metazoan proteins with diverse functions  <cit> . this domain is involved in recognition and binding of carbohydrates in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit> . alignments and diverse structural analyses revealed that pdc-lectin is functional and shares the mannose binding specificity characteristics of the human dc-sign crd. the presence of the highly conserved motif "epn" and "wnd" in the ctld of pdc-lectin argues in favour of the specificity for mannose binding in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit>  and the molecular model obtained using the modweb server reveals that all residues involved in this binding specificity are located in similar predicted structures by comparison with the human dc-signr crd. moreover, the differences observed between the template  and the pdc-lectin molecular model are located in regions of the molecule that are not considered as essential for function. in addition, pdc-lectin displays high similarities  for lectins recently characterized from acropora millepora  <cit> . these lectins, named millectin, were isolated by mannose affinity chromatography and were shown to bind to bacterial pathogens as well as coral symbionts, dinoflagellates of the genus symbiodinium. all these elements taken together strengthen the hypothesis that pdc-lectin is functional and shares the mannose binding specificity of the human dc-sign crd.

recent work has highlighted the key role played by lectin/glycan interactions in symbiosis onset  <cit> . the virginia weis group provided evidence for a recognition mechanism involving lectin/glycan at the onset of symbiosis between aposymbiotic larvae of the coral fungia scutaria and their endosymbiotic zooxanthellae  <cit> . they showed that algal cell surface glycan ligands, such as 慣-mannose/慣-glucose and 慣-galactose play a role in recognition during initial contact at the onset of symbiosis  <cit> . a second study described the role of another lectin, called mermaid- <dig>  <cit> . this protein displayed the same structural features as pdc-lectin sharing the same dc-sign domain. mermaid- <dig> mediates symbiotic bacteria acquisition by the marine nematode laxus oneistus. in this thiotrophic symbiosis, a monolayer of symbiotic sulphur-oxidizing bacteria covers the cuticle of the nematode. the authors showed that this secreted ca2+-dependent mannose-specific lectin is capable of inducing symbiont aggregation and acquisition  <cit> .

the different structural and bibliographic elements described here argue in favour of a putative role for pdc-lectin in recognition and binding between the host and the symbionts. the putative signal of secretion, the structural similarities with these different proteins sharing the dc-sign domain and its mannose binding specificity suggest that pdc-lectin could interact with zooxanthellae mannose ligands to mediate symbiont acquisition as it was described for the f. scutaria/symbiodinium model  <cit> . in order to strengthen this hypothesis we performed expression analysis experiments. we confirmed the expression of pdc-lectin in coral cells but the most interesting finding was obtained using immunolocalization experiments where we found evidence of pdc-lectin immunoreactivity in coral cells belonging to endodermal tissue. this labeled tissue is in contact with free zooxanthellae that are transitorily present in the coelenteron . we observed a peripheral immunostaining pattern adjacent to or in the cellular membrane in contact with the coelenteron. in addition, some free zooxanthellae were observed in contact with endodermal cells and interestingly, as shown in figure 6c and 6g, the labeling appears at the interface between zooxanthellae and host coral cells. these data strongly suggest a putative role of pdc-lectin in zooxanthellae interaction and acquisition.

finally, our hypothesis is strengthened by the diminution of the pdc-lectin transcript level during stress and during symbiosis breakdown. pdc-lectin transcript concentration decreases just before bleaching occurs and remains low during bleaching process. this means that this gene could be regulated just before symbiosis breakdown. consequently, and in agreement with the previous data obtained, we propose that bleaching is due in part to a decrease in zooxanthellae acquisition and/or sequestration.

CONCLUSIONS
this novel hypothetical mechanism could appear in conjunction with different cellular events reviewed in a recent paper  <cit> . in this review, the author examined the cellular events leading to the collapse of symbiosis during heat and light stress. briefly, ros is shown to play a central role in both injuries to the partners and to inter-partner communication of a stress response. this review also presented evidence that bleaching is a host innate immune response against symbionts. finally, the different ways of elimination or removal of the symbiont tissues are described through a variety of mechanisms including exocytosis, host cell detachment and host cell apoptosis. our work reveals another interesting hypothesis with the inhibition of zooxanthellae acquisition processes. during heat stress zooxanthellae could be considered as toxic due to the over-production of ros and therefore eliminated by host immune responses.

future work focusing on pdc-lectin function has to be conducted to verify our hypothesis. we could study the mechanisms of zooxanthellae acquisition during the resilience process following experimental bleaching. recombinant pdc-lectin and antibodies directed against recombinant pdc-lectin could be used to facilitate or inhibit the acquisition process of cultured and labeled zooxanthellae during resilience. this functional validation is necessary to be sure of having an early marker of thermal bleaching.

this marker could be used by coral reef managers to  distinguish between different stresses on corals, and  precisely and accurately predict bleaching events in conjunction with temperature anomalies indices such as "degree heating weeks" or "hotspot" developed by the noaa. this will help managers in the implementation of policy responses and compensatory measures. in addition, these functional biomarkers of thermal stress may be used to evaluate the health of coral transplants kept in public aquaria, in coral farms and for coral nubbins transplanted during restoration projects as these entities are key factors in coral reef conservation in a sustainable development and global warming context.
