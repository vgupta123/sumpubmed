BACKGROUND
the genus yersinia includes three human pathogens, y. pestis, the etiological agent of plague via intradermal fleabites or inhalation, and y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica, which cause self-limiting enteric disease by the oral route. in spite of the differences in route of infection and severity of disease, the three species share similar pathogenic mechanisms, primarily the ~ <dig> kb virulence plasmid  that encodes for the type iii secretion system   <cit> . upon contact with host cells and a shift to host temperature of 37°c, yersinia induces t3ss expression to translocate yersinia outer proteins  into the host cytosol to modulate the host immune response and promote pathogen survival  <cit> .

all three yersinia species target the lymphoid system during infection and replicate in lymphatic tissue as aggregates of extracellular bacteria  <cit> . yersinia strains that lack pcd1/pyv do not replicate extracellularly and have been shown to be contained within granulomas that are eventually eliminated  <cit> . yersinia are unusual amongst other gram-negative bacteria that express the t3ss, in that they do not actively induce phagocytosis for entry and intracellular growth in the host  <cit> . instead, yersinia inject several yops, including yoph, e, and t, to disrupt the host actin cytoskeleton and resist uptake via phagocytosis by neutrophils. although pathogenic yersinia have been reported to multiply within macrophages early in the infection process  <cit> , y. pestis exponential growth occurs primarily in the extracellular phase, causing acute septicemia with blood counts as high as  <dig> cfu/ml  <cit> . thus, in order to establish successful infection, yersinia is dependent on targeting multiple host signaling pathways to evade host immune defense and induce host cell death. for example, yopp/j functions as a deubiquitinating protease and acetyltransferase to inhibit both the host nf-κb and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling pathways, leading to a block in cytokine secretion and apoptosis of host macrophages  <cit> . although discovery of yop effector targets have begun to clarify mechanisms of yersinia virulence, it is likely the case that additional host targets remain to be defined. identification of host cell factors that are targeted by yersinia during infection would provide valuable molecular insights in understanding yersinia pathogenesis, and ultimately, in designing effective host-targeted therapies and antimicrobial agents.

in order to systematically identify novel host targets required for yersinia infection, we performed an rnai screen using a short hairpin rna  kinome library. the development of rnai approaches has greatly enabled the examination of the roles of individual human genes by specific gene silencing  <cit> . both small and large-scale rnai screens have been applied to the discovery of host targets in response to infection by intracellular pathogens, including s. typhimurium <cit> , m. tuberculosis <cit> , and l. monocytogenes <cit> , and the hiv  <cit> , hcv  <cit> , and influenza  <cit>  viruses. our shrna screen is based on the recovery of nf-κb activation following y. enterocolitica infection of hek- <dig> cells. nf-κb controls expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response, including tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and mip1β, and thus plays a critical role in the clearance of the bacteria by the immune response. we identified  <dig> host genes that are targeted by y. enterocolitica to inhibit nf-κb-regulated gene expression and validated their role in host cells infected with y. pestis, in addition to y. enterocolitica. we also describe a novel c-kit-egr <dig> host signaling pathway that is targeted by yersinia during the infection process. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first major rnai effort to screen for host targets in response to a predominantly extracellular pathogen.

RESULTS
rnai screen to identify host cell factors that are required for yersinia-mediated inhibition of nf-κb-driven gene expression
we conducted a functional genomic screen using  <dig> shrna hairpins targeting  <dig> human kinase and kinase-related genes to identify host factors that inhibit nf-κb-mediated gene expression by pathogenic yersinia. the screen was performed using the highly-virulent y. enterocolitica wa strain, which has been shown to impair nf-κb activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production more efficiently than virulent y. pestis strains and induces a strong apoptotic effect on host cells  <cit> . to maximize assay sensitivity and noise reduction for the screen, we stimulated the hek <dig> cell line with the inflammatory mediator tnf-α, resulting in ~70-fold induction of nf-κb reporter gene activity, an excellent signal-to-noise ratio for a high throughput screen  . we calculated the z-factor  to be ~ <dig>  upon infection of hek <dig> at moi  <dig> for  <dig> hrs, followed by  <dig> h of tnf-α stimulation. z’ is a statistical evaluation of hts performance and reflects the robustness and reliability of the assay. z’ ≥  <dig>  is equivalent to ≥  <dig> standard deviations between the positive and negative controls and represents excellent assay parameters   <cit> . we designed our screen  to select for shrnas that increased nf-κb-driven luciferase activity ≥40% compared to the mean of all assay reads in y. enterocolitica-infected, tnf-α stimulated cells for each plate.  additionally, we applied a standard z-score method to identify shrnas that produced a statistically-significant recovery  of luciferase activity .

we identified  <dig> kinase genes, that when silenced, led to recovery of nf-κb-mediated luciferase activity in response to y. enterocolitica infection . the screen identified genes that function in different cellular processes, including signal transduction , cytoskeleton dynamics , and regulation of ion channel activity . in addition to the kinase shrna library, we screened a collection of  <dig> shrna constructs that targeted  <dig> genes annotated for chaperone activity to determine whether the heat shock, protein folding, and stress response machinery is required for successful yersinia infection. we found that silencing of hsph <dig>  caused recovery of nf-κb regulated gene expression in response to y. enterocolitica infection .

validation of candidate ‘hits’ from rnai screen
we selected  <dig> genes, sgk <dig>  wnk <dig>  c-kit, gne <dig>  hsph <dig>  pak <dig>  map3k <dig>  nik/map3k <dig>  and abl, representative of different cellular pathways, for further validation studies. we performed a secondary rnai screen using a pool of sirna duplexes that targeted four different sequences per gene. introduction of the sirna duplexes into re-luc2p-hek <dig> cells resulted in ≥ 70% reduction in cognate gene mrna levels  and reiterated the ≥40% recovery of tnf-α-induced nf-κb gene expression in response to y. enterocolitica, as previously seen in the original shrna screen . silencing of all nine genes increased the ratio of nf-κb-driven luciferase activity between infected and uninfected cells , when compared to hek <dig> cells expressing a control  sirna . similarly, sirna silencing increased the ratio  of nf-κb expression between y. pestis ind195-infected and uninfected cells compared to the control sample , suggesting that many of the host genes identified from the screen are also targeted by y. pestis during onset of plague .

to determine whether sirna treatment itself significantly dampened nf-κb-regulated gene expression, we examined luciferase activity in cells treated with sirnas against relb, a member of the nf-κb family. in the absence of infection, luciferase activity was decreased ~2-fold in cells treated with sirnas against relb, compared to the other sirna-treated cells.  infection with the virulent y. pestis ind <dig> strain produced no further change in luciferase expression , indicating that a basal level of luciferase activity had been reached in cells depleted of relb. our data suggest that sirna treatment alone did not significantly manipulate nf-κb activity.

use of small molecule inhibitors to validate kinase function in yersinia-mediated inhibition of nf-κb activation and cytokine production
we selected three kinases, c-kit, ckii, and sgk <dig>  to further validate their functions in yersinia-mediated nf-κb inhibition using small molecule inhibitors . none of the tested kinase inhibitors induced activation of nf-κb-regulated gene expression in uninfected controls or affected yersinia growth in host media . the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit, also known as stem cell growth factor receptor cd <dig>  is expressed predominantly in progenitor hematopoietic cells and mast cells. upon stem cell factor  ligand binding, c-kit triggers multiple signaling cascades, including pi3k/akt, ras/erk, and jnk, which are essential for regulating proliferation, survival and cell differentiation  <cit> . incubation of y. enterocolitica- or y. pestis-infected re-luc2p-hek <dig> cells with osi- <dig>  a highly-specific c-kit inhibitor, led to rescue of tnf-α-induced nf-κb activation, compared to no drug controls.  treatment of the monocytic cell line thp- <dig> or primary normal human dendritic cells  with osi- <dig> induced a similar protective effect against yersinia-mediated suppression of tnf-α secretion, as measured by elisa, indicating that c-kit is required for yersinia-induced repression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release .

we also tested the effect of the small molecule tbb, an inhibitor of the ckii serine kinase, which functions in cell stress response, cell cycle and cell growth regulation by activation of ikk. ckii also regulates expression of hsph <dig>  another stress response gene identified in our shrna screen  <cit> . similar to osi <dig>  pretreatment of re-luc2p-hek <dig>  thp- <dig>  and nhdc cells with tbb resulted in higher levels of nf-κb-regulated gene expression and tnf-α release compared to a no drug control, in response to both y. enterocolitica and y. pestis infection .

the small molecule cki- <dig> was used to validate the role of sgk <dig>  on nf-κb-regulated gene expression in response to yersinia infection. sgk <dig> is a serine/threonine kinase that functions in cellular stress response and regulates activity of the epithelial sodium channel enac  <cit> , a function shared with wnk <dig>  another kinase identified from the shrna screen. incubation of re-luc2p-hek <dig> cells with cki- <dig> resulted in increased nf-κb-mediated luciferase activity upon exposure of y. enterocolitica and y. pestis-infected cells to tnf-α . however, cki- <dig> did not lead to increased tnf-α release in yersinia-infected thp- <dig> cells . this finding is consistent with the tissue-specific expression profile of sgk <dig> in epithelial cells such as hek <dig>  but not in monocyte-like thp- <dig> cells  <cit> .

finally, we also tested the effect of h- <dig>  a small molecule inhibitor of akt, a downstream mediator of the pi3k pathway that plays an essential role in cell survival, migration and adhesion. although akt itself was not classified as a hit in the shrna screen, we did identify pik3r <dig>  a regulatory subunit of pi3k, which acts directly upstream of akt. furthermore, akt was previously identified as essential for intracellular growth of another t3ss pathogen, s. typhimurium <cit> . pre-treatment of re-luc2p-hek <dig> cells with h- <dig> had no effect on nf-κb-regulated luciferase activity in response to either y. enterocolitica or y. pestis infection . however, h- <dig> induced a significant increase of tnf-α production in thp <dig> cells and nhdc infected with either y. enterocolitica or y. pestis, compared to untreated cells.  these cell-type specific effects of sgk <dig> and pi3k/akt likely reflect the different host cell tropism, from epithelial to macrophage cells, exhibited by yersinia.

pathogenic yersinia exploit host pathways regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit to suppress inflammatory cytokine release
we next assessed the effect of c-kit signaling on the expression profile of  <dig> human inflammatory genes in y. pestis-infected thp- <dig> cells. we observed >3-fold upregulation of several chemokines, including il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and cell adhesion gene vcam <dig> in y. pestis-infected thp- <dig> cells compared to uninfected cells . in contrast, expression of the early growth response  <dig> transcription factor  was downregulated >70% in cells infected with y. pestis. egr <dig> has been previously found to regulate transcription of several chemokines  and cytokines , and to confer responsiveness to il- <dig> and tnf signaling  <cit> . abrogation of c-kit signaling by osi- <dig> recovered egr- <dig> levels and resulted in a further increase in il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  il-1α, and tnf expression, in thp- <dig> cells infected with y. pestis compared to untreated cells .

to further explore whether c-kit function can regulate egr <dig> and downstream inflammatory gene expression, we examined the effect of osi- <dig> treatment on egr <dig>  vcam <dig>  ccl <dig>  and il- <dig> gene expression in y. pestis-infected thp- <dig> cells using qpcr . inhibition of c-kit kinase activity by osi- <dig>  restored egr <dig> transcription >2-fold in y. pestis-infected thp- <dig> cells compared to infected cells with functional c-kit . similarly, osi- <dig> treatment induced vcam <dig>  ccl <dig>  and il- <dig> transcription upon bacterial infection , suggesting that c-kit function is required for the inhibition of key cytokines and adhesion molecules by pathogenic yersinia. notably, treatment of thp- <dig> cells with osi- <dig> alone did not significantly change egr <dig> transcript levels , indicating that pharmacological inhibition of c-kit did not initiate a non-specific immune response mediated by egr <dig> in the absence of bacterial infection. collectively, these findings suggest that there is a link between c-kit function and suppression of the host immune response by pathogenic yersinia and that transcriptional inhibition of egr <dig> by yersinia is dependent on c-kit function.

we next studied the role of yersinia t3ss in suppression of the host immune response via c-kit signaling. the expression profiles of egr <dig>  il- <dig>  and ccl <dig> were compared in thp- <dig> cells infected with pathogenic y. enterocolitica wa and its non-pathogenic counterpart, y. enterocolitica wa- <dig> , cured of the pyv virulence plasmid . inhibition of c-kit with osi <dig> fully restored egr <dig> levels in cells infected with virulent y. enterocolitica and significantly recovered transcription of il- <dig> and ccl <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-infection . in contrast, we did not observe any significant effect by the c-kit inhibitor osi <dig> on egr <dig>  il- <dig>  and ccl <dig> transcription in thp- <dig> cells exposed to pyv- y. enterocolitica. inhibition of jnk <dig>  acting downstream of c-kit signaling, with the small molecule bi-78d <dig>  <cit>  did not exhibit any protective effect on gene transcription  at either time point of bacterial infection, compared to drug-free cells . since accumulation of yopj/p in host cells upon yersinia infection has been previously linked to cell death via activation of apoptotic pathways, we assessed cell viability at various mois. we registered no decrease in cell viability in drug-free cells or cells treated with the jnk <dig> inhibitor, even after  <dig> h post-infection of thp- <dig> cells with virulent y.entorocolitica at moi  <dig> of the assay.  taken together, these findings indicate that c-kit function is exploited by yersinia t3ss to suppress production of key transcription factors and cytokines involved in the regulation of the host immune response.

we also show that ~95% depletion of c-kit transcript levels by sirna treatment  rescued egr <dig>  vcam <dig>  ccl <dig>  and il- <dig> gene expression in response to y. enterocolitica wa infection in thp- <dig> cells, compared to infected control cells treated with non-targeting sirna  . similarly, expression levels of the nf-κb transcription factors, nf-κb1/p <dig> and rela/p <dig>  were recovered in c-kit-silenced cells in response to y. enterocolitica wa infection. in the absence of infection, silencing of c-kit expression by sirna did not induce any significant change in the expression levels of egr <dig> or the tested cytokines and transcription factors .

to further investigate the interplay between c-kit signaling and pathogenic yersinia, we measured rela levels in purified nuclei isolated from untreated or y. enterocolitica-infected thp- <dig> cells . in response to inflammatory stimuli, rela is normally released from its cytoplasmic inhibitor, iκbα, and transported to the nucleus to modulate gene expression  <cit> . based on flow cytometric analysis, rela protein levels were shown to increase by ~2-fold in the nuclei of thp- <dig> cells infected with y. enterocolitica wa, compared to uninfected cells.  interestingly, pre-treatment of thp- <dig> cells with osi- <dig> led to a higher 4-fold increase of nuclear rela levels, suggesting that yersinia targets the c-kit signaling pathway to suppress post-transcriptional activation of rela. collectively, our data demonstrate that virulent yersinia inhibits both transcription and post-transcriptional regulation of key inflammatory proteins via the c-kit signaling pathway.

c-kit phosphorylation is induced upon yersinia infection independently of t3ss
we next investigated c-kit phosphorylation to assess kinase activation in response to yersinia infection. the binding of natural ligand scf to c-kit has been shown to induce receptor dimerization, rapid auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, and subsequent recruitment of signaling proteins to activate multiple downstream pathways  <cit> . we examined c-kit phosphorylation in thp <dig> cells using western blots, in response to infection with both y. enterocolitica virulent  and attenuated  strains  c-kit exhibited maximal phosphorylation at ~45 min post-infection in both y. enterocolitica strains , compared to scf-induced phosphorylation, which peaked at  <dig> min , demonstrating that yersinia lps or other surface molecule can trigger c-kit signaling, albeit at a delayed rate. this delayed phosphorylation response to pathogen exposure may stem from the time needed for bacterial chemotaxis and adhesion to host cells prior to activation of host signaling pathways.

differential c-kit expression at the cell surface in human dendritic cells
to determine whether there is a link between c-kit expression levels and host immune response, we investigated the effect of pathogenic yersinia infection on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human dendritic cells expressing naturally varying levels of c-kit. we obtained populations of mature nhdc from seven independent human donors and compared the expression levels of c-kit using flow cytometry with fluorescently-labeled c-kit antibody. two out of seven donors  expressed ~2-fold higher c-kit levels  compared to the remaining  <dig> donors . the nhdcs from d <dig> and d <dig> also exhibited greater relative inhibition of tnf-α release upon infection with y. pestis, compared to the other donor nhdcs , demonstrating that increased c-kit expression is associated with increased suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release during yersinia infection. these findings are consistent with the increased production of tnf-α during osi- <dig> treatment of yersinia-infected thp- <dig> and nhdc cells , and suggest that c-kit may be a potential host biomarker for susceptibility to yersinia–mediated suppression of innate immune response.

discussion
we have performed a rnai screen to identify host genes targeted by a primarily extracellular pathogen, yersinia. most of the identified genes, including c-kit, sgk, and ckii, have not been previously linked to pathogen infection, and thus reveal novel mechanisms of virulence and host immunity in response to yersinia infection. although the rnai screen was based on y. enterocolitica infection, the majority of validated hits were also required for nf-κb inhibition by y. pestis. given the genomic conservation between y. enterocolitica and y. pestis, the overlapping gene hits are likely to function in host signaling pathways impacted by common yersinia pathogenesis mechanisms, such as the t3ss.

we had originally attempted to optimize a rnai screen based on y. pestis infection, but were unable to establish a reliable infection assay for high-throughput analysis of host response. interestingly, the t3ss of y. pestis has been found to be less efficient in cell culture compared to that of y. enterocolitica <cit> . a key mediator of yersinia pathogenesis is the yopp/j effector, , which induces apoptosis in the host. although yopp and yopj share ~97% sequence identity, yopp exhibits a greater capacity for accumulation in the host cells, which correlates with enhanced cytotoxicity  <cit> . we speculate that the relatively weaker pathogenic effect of yopj may have been the basis of difficulty in developing a robust rnai screen using y. pestis.

in this study, we describe a c-kit-egr <dig> signaling pathway that is targeted by yersinia during infection. although c-kit and egr <dig> have not been previously positioned experimentally in the same pathway to the best of our knowledge, c-kit and egr <dig> functions can be linked based on convergence of multiple overlapping pathways . activation of c-kit has been shown to stimulate the jnk, mek/erk, and pi3k/akt signaling pathways, which can feed into egr <dig>  <cit>  and other transcription factors to regulate cell growth, differentiation and inflammatory responses  <cit> . in turn, egr <dig> regulates expression of chemokines  and cytokines  and was found to act synergistically with nf-κb to stimulate il- <dig> transcription  <cit> .

our results support a model in which c-kit signaling is targeted by yersinia t3ss to suppress pro-inflammatory responses. some kinases activated downstream of c-kit, such as mek and pi3k, have been shown to be inhibited by the yersinia effectors yopj and yoph, respectively  <cit> . yopj has also been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of mkk4/sek <dig> and attenuates jnk signaling and subsequent egr <dig> activation  <cit>  . our findings suggest that downregulation of a receptor kinase function that leads to nf-κb activation can ameliorate the inhibitory effect of yersinia t3ss. since we observed that the inhibition of another signaling protein akt <dig> also resulted in higher production of tnf-α by yersinia-infected macrophage cells , we hypothesized that upon bacterial infection, multiple signal transduction pathways are triggered by various host extracellular and intracellular receptors of pathogen associated molecular patterns . however, not all signaling pathways are inactivated by yersinia during infection, and inhibition of c-kit may lead to redirection to alternative signaling pathways, such as the lps-activated cd <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling to p <dig> and jnk, to recover nf-kb-driven gene expression  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by our observations that pharmacological inactivation of jnk <dig> using the inhibitor bi-78d <dig> did not recover pro-inflammatory gene expression in thp- <dig> cells infected with pathogenic yersinia , while akt <dig> and c-kit inhibition resulted in increased tnf-α production in infected thp- <dig> and nhdc . thus, redistribution of signaling pathways can still lead to mitigation of nf-κb-regulated immune response during the course of yersinia infection.

the exact mechanism of yersinia activation of c-kit remains unclear. the natural ligand of c-kit, scf, has been shown to activate c-kit phosphorylation within  <dig> min of treatment  <cit> . in response to y. enterocolitica, c-kit exhibited maximal phosphorylation at ~45 min post-infection in thp- <dig> cells by western blot , demonstrating that yersinia infection is capable of stimulating c-kit activation, albeit via a delayed response compared to scf. since, we observed this delayed phosphorylation in both virulent and attenuated y. enterocolitica, it may be the case that lps or other bacterial cell surface molecule can mediate host receptor phosphorylation and/or signaling, rather than solely the t3ss. we have also shown that inhibition of c-kit signaling by the small molecule osi- <dig> induced an altered inflammatory gene expression pattern in response to pathogenic yersinia that resembled infection by a non-virulent strain , further supporting functional links between c-kit activity and yersinia virulence. it may be the case that yop effectors either directly or indirectly modulate c-kit function following injection into the host. in preliminary studies, we have found a strong binding interaction between c-kit and the t3ss chaperone syce . another possibility is that yersinia interacts with lipid rafts containing c-kit in the plasma membranes of host cells during the infection process  <cit> . activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by bacterial lps has been reported previously. for example, egfr transactivation by lps was induced by p <dig> and matrix metalloproteases upon tlr4-lps interaction and was essential for cox- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . increased phosphorylation of egfr was observed 5–60 min of treatment with purified lps.

in the search for host factors whose functions are required by pathogenic yersinia to suppress the host innate immune response, we identified additional genes that belong to common functional networks. for example, the sgk and wnk families directly regulate each other to control osmotic stress and cellular ion balance. during yersinia infection, the needle-like t3ss injects effector proteins into the host, increasing membrane permeability and introducing osmotic stress to the host  <cit> . osmotic stress caused by ion imbalance can activate sgk1/wnk <dig> function and modulate downstream mapk-erk signaling pathways  <cit> , thus potentially providing yersinia with another signaling pathway to manipulate gene expression. wnk <dig> is a substrate of sgk <dig> during insulin activation of pi3k  <cit>  and can activate sgk <dig> during enac regulation  <cit> . wnk <dig> also participates in an epidermal growth factor receptor -erk pathway that includes two signaling molecules, map3k <dig> and mek1/ <dig>  which were also identified as hits from our rnai screen . a direct protein-protein interaction between wnk <dig> and map3k <dig> has been previously demonstrated  <cit> . map3k <dig> regulates erk signaling through mek1/ <dig> and is required for nf-κb activation  <cit> . the yersinia effector yopj has been reported to catalyze the acetylation of target kinases to inhibit mek and nf-κb signaling  <cit> . similar to c-kit inactivation, downregulation of wnk <dig> and map3k <dig> may shunt the activation of transcription factors that regulate inflammatory cytokine release to an alternative signaling pathway.

several of the rnai screen hits that impact signal transduction can be directly linked to regulation of nf-κb signaling. for example, the catalytic α subunit of ckii was found to phosphorylate ikkα with high specificity and to stabilize targeting of iκb for proteosomal degradation in response to such cell stressors as uv radiation and tnf-α  <cit> . nik/map3k <dig> regulates the alternative nf-κb signaling pathway  <cit> . pik3r <dig>  a regulatory subunit of pi3k, functions in akt activation, which leads to phosphorylation of p <dig> or activation of ikkα through multiple signaling pathways  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our studies have identified multiple host kinases, that when downregulated, mitigated yersinia-mediated suppression of the host primary immune response. in particular, c-kit is of great interest as a potential biomarker for susceptibility to yersinia infection, given our preliminary data showing that primary dendritic cells that express higher c-kit levels produced less tnf-α in response to y. pestis infection. furthermore, some of the identified genes and signaling pathways have been found to be essential for infection by other bacterial species. for example, the pi3k pathway is required for successful infection in yersinia , listeria and salmonella <cit> . thus, the rnai screen hits may represent candidate targets for development of host-derived therapeutics that inhibit not only yersinia infection, but also potentially a wide range of bacterial pathogens that employ common virulence mechanisms.
