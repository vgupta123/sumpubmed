BACKGROUND
repetitive dna sequences constitute a substantial proportion of eukaryotic genomes. for example, in mammals they account for nearly half of the genome, and in some plants they constitute up to 90% of the genome  <cit> . most of these repeated dnas are, or were originated from, transposable elements  through transposing and duplicating events. on the basis of mechanisms of their transposition, tes can be divided into two classes: retrotransposons, which proliferate via reverse transcription, and dna transposons, which move strictly through dna intermediates. frequently, genomes harbour few active tes; instead, genomes contains multiple repetitive elements representing remnants  derived from tes  <cit> . although repetitive dna elements have been often considered as "selfish" or "parasitic" dnas, the now growing evidence is that these elements are involved in shaping genomes and are playing important role in epigenetic regulation of genome expression  <cit> .

protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania are causative agents of a complex of diseases known as leishmaniasis. the burden associated with these diseases remains important:  <dig> – <dig> million new cases per year and  <dig> million people at risk in  <dig> countries  <cit> . apart from its impact in human health, leishmania parasites and related trypanosomes  are being extensively studied because of peculiar molecular and cellular characteristics. the genome of leishmania major was sequenced  <cit> , and more recently the genome sequences for two other leishmania species  have been also deciphered  <cit> . the comparison of these sequences reveals marked conservation of the genome architecture within the leishmania genus, showing similar gene content and a remarkable degree of synteny  <cit> . the organization of protein-coding genes into long, strand-specific, polycistronic clusters is a conspicuous feature of the leishmania species, also observed in the t. brucei and t. cruzi genomes  <cit> . this peculiar gene organization seems to be related to the lack of transcriptional control by rna polymerase ii promoters; rather, transcription initiation appears to begin in a low fidelity manner transcribing long polycistronic precursor transcripts  <cit> . despite having diverged  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago, the genomes of l. major, t. brucei and t. cruzi are highly synthenic. for example,  <dig> and 75% of the genes in t. brucei and l. major remain in the same gene order  <cit> . in spite of this conservation in chromosome organization, the genomes of these trypanosomes differ in the content of repeated sequences. unlike leishmania, the genomes of t. brucei and t. cruzi are riddled with interspersed elements  <cit> .

the leishmania genome is relatively poor in repeated sequences. the first repetitive dna sequence characterized in leishmania corresponded to the telomeric repeats  <cit> . afterwards, multiple tandem repeats of a 60-bp sequence, named lmet <dig>  were found on at least six chromosomes of parasites of the l. donovani complex, being absent from other leishmania species  <cit> . piarroux et al  <cit>  characterized a low copy, repetitive dna sequence from l. infantum that was located exclusively at a large chromosome; this sequence was detected in many other leishmania species. a repeated sequence with features of minisatellite dna was characterized in the l. infantum genome; this element, called listir <dig>  is 81-bp long and g+c rich and it was found interspersed at the subtelomeric regions of four chromosomes  <cit> . a 348-bp long element, designated lir <dig>  was found tandemly repeated within the non-transcribed spacers of the rdna locus of l. infantum  <cit> . conserved repeats, named lctas, have been characterized to be adjacent to telomeres in l. braziliensis, l. major, l. mexicana and l. lainsoni  <cit> . also, several subtelomeric repetitive sequences have been characterized, showing to be responsible for size differences among the three l. major homologues for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . similar repeats have been found as tandemly arranged clusters at subtelomeric regions in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of l. infantum. interestingly, these repeats are transcribed by rna polymerase ii into noncoding rnas in a developmentally regulated manner  <cit> . non-ltr retrotransposons are abundant in the genome of t. brucei and t. cruzi; by contrast, retroelements are absent from the l. major genome, where only remnants of degenerated ingi/l1tc-related elements  are detectable . evolutionary analyses indicate that the trypanosomatid ancestor contained active transposable elements that have been retained in the genus trypanosoma, but were lost in the l. major evolutionary line  <cit> . recently, in an outstanding work, bringaud et al  <cit>  have found that the l. major contains two classes of short interspersed repeated sequences, sider <dig>  and sider <dig> , which displays hallmarks of trypanosomatid retroposons. members of the sider <dig> family show high sequence similarity with a conserved 450–550-bp element, located in the 3'utr of several leishmania amastigote-specific transcripts, that is implicated in stage-specific translational control  <cit> . sider <dig> elements, also located predominantly within 3'utrs, have a demonstrated role in mrna degradation  <cit> . thus, it was postulated that leishmania have recycled the retroposon remnants to regulatory sequences to globally modulate the expression of a number of genes  <cit> .

in the course of studying repetitive dna in the l. infantum genome, we identified and characterized a family of repeated sequences, which are interspersed along the different chromosomes. these sequence elements are present in different leishmania species and, here, we show a detailed analysis of these elements in the l. infantum chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and in the l. braziliensis and l. major chromosome  <dig>  during the preparation of this manuscript, the existence of this class of sequences in the l. major genome was reported  <cit> , and, consequently, we adopted the proposed name  for the elements identified in this work.

RESULTS
identification of a new family of repeated sequences in l. infantum
as an approach to isolate and identify repetitive sequences in the l. infantum genome, we hybridized genomic dna macroarrays of l. infantum  with labelled total genomic dna of this parasite. a clone, named pgli5-g8g, was selected for further analysis on the basis of its strong hybridization signal. sequence analysis showed that the 2280-bp long insert locate on l. infantum chromosome  <dig> . however, the most striking observation, derived from the blast analysis, was that sequences, homologous to the 5'-end region of this clone, were also present in many additional locations in all the  <dig> l. infantum chromosomal contigs. a thoughtful search along the l. infantum chromosome  <dig> , using iterative rounds of blast searches, led us to the identification up to  <dig> sequence elements. we named these elements as lisider2s, following the nomenclature coined by bringraud and coworkers in a recent publication describing the existence of this class of sequences in the l. major genome; sider stands for short interspersed degenerated retroposon  <cit> . the different lisider2s found in chromosome  <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  these elements have two salient features: a size around  <dig> bp and a high g+c content . based on the l. infantum database , we have calculated that the g+c content for the l. infantum chromosome  <dig> is  <dig> , very similar to the g+c content for the whole l. infantum genome  <cit> . all lisider <dig> elements have g+c content higher than the mean value for the entire genome, and some of them exceed 70%. a physical location of the lisider <dig> elements on l. infantum chromosome  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  these elements were found in both plus and minus strands of the chromosome and they showed a quite even distribution along the chromosome. however, it is noticeable that most of the elements have the same orientation as the polycistronic transcription units in which they are located.

phylogenetic analyses , based on the clustalw alignment of the different lisider2s , allowed us to group these elements into subfamilies. a subfamily was defined as a group of lisider2s sharing sequence identity ≥ 85%. thus, the  <dig> lisider2s can be grouped into  <dig> subfamilies , remaining  <dig> orphan elements . remarkably, members of a given subfamily show a relationship of proximity, i.e. they are grouped close in the chromosome without intercalating non-familiar lisider2s . for example, elements of the subfamily a, composed of eight members, are located at the left hand of l. infantum chromosome  <dig> and no at other chromosomal regions.

another structural feature of lisider <dig> elements, evidenced during the bioinformatics identification of the elements, was their composite nature. thus, the elements from different subfamilies share only sequence blocks of variable size that are present in different combinations in each lisider <dig>  an example illustrating this observation is shown in figure 3a. nevertheless, a conserved consensus sequence for the lisider2s can be derived from the alignment of the  <dig> elements present in chromosome  <dig> , suggesting a common origin for all elements. as suggested by bringaud et al.  <cit> , sider <dig> elements could be vestigial retroposons, derived from non-ltr retrotransposons of the ingi/l1tc clade that remains active in the genomes of t. brucei and t. cruzi  <cit> . this hypothesis is based mainly upon the existence at the 5'-extremity of some lmjsider <dig> elements of the "79-bp signature", which constitutes the hallmark of trypanosomatid non-ltr retrotransposons and related elements  <cit> . using the two "79-bp signatures" found in the l. major sider <dig> elements  for blastn searches, we found  <dig> matches in the l. infantum chromosome  <dig> sequence. interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> matches were coincident with the location of lisider <dig> elements, indicating that this is not a fortuitous association. thus,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> sider <dig> elements, present in l. infantum chromosome  <dig>  have a distinguishable "79-bp signature" that invariantly is located at, or close to, the 5'end of the element. for most of the lisider <dig>  the "79-bp signature" was found to be more similar to the lmsider2b sequence than to the lmsider2a one . a comparison of the consensus "79-bp signature" present in the lisider2s with that existing in other trypanosomatid elements is shown in figure 3c. for some lmjsider <dig> elements , the presence of putative target site duplication  was noticed by bringaud and co-workers  <cit> . however, after inspection of sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the different lisider2s in chromosome  <dig>  we did not find clear tsd sequences, even though when members of a subfamily were separately analyzed. also, the presence of short adenosine-rich stretches was described at the 3'-end of some of the lmjsider <dig> elements. in the characterized lisider <dig>  adenosine runs were found to be present in about 28% of the elements, either at the 3'-end or in close proximity to it.

in order to know whether or not this peculiar organization of lisider <dig> elements is shared by the elements located in other l. infantum chromosomes, we carried out a systematic search of lisider2s along the chromosome  <dig>  we chose this chromosome, because we realized that sequences similar to lisider2s had been previously described in the homologue chromosome in l. major  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> elements were identified in the l. infantum chromosome  <dig>  similarly, these lisider2s were found to have g+c-rich sequences, to have a size around 500-bp, and can be grouped in subfamilies according to sequence homology . in chromosome  <dig>  we found that members of subfamilies q and r are intercalated ; however, it should be noted that these subfamilies are closely related each other in sequence . another relevant finding was that two lisider2s, which constitute subfamily s , have an uncommon size , being the sider2-homologue region located at the 3'-end half of these elements. as occurred with lisider2s of chromosome  <dig>  most of lisider2s in chromosome  <dig> are in the same orientation as the transcriptional units . furthermore,  <dig> out of the  <dig>  lisider2- <dig> have a distinctive "79-bp signature" .

athe elements are named with the chromosome number  and the position in the chromosome, according to the contig linj20_20070420_v <dig> sequence; d and r denote that the element is located in the plus or minus dna strand, respectively.

bthe presence of significant blastn matches with the "79-bp signature" lmsider2a  or lmsider2b  is indicated.

*truncated element.

as deduced from blast analyses , the rest of l. infantum chromosomes must be also populated by lisider <dig> elements showing similar features as those described in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  taking into account both the chromosomal size and the number of sider2s found in l. infantum chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  we estimated that the l. infantum haploid content of sider2s would be around  <dig> copies. this estimation is in agreement with the determination of  <dig> copies of lmjsider <dig> in the l. major genome  <cit> .

sequences homologous to lisider2s are also present in the genome of other leishmania species
since the complete sequence of the l. major is known  <cit> , we carried out the same bioinformatics analysis on the l. major database using as query sequences the different lisider <dig> elements found in the l. infantum chromosome  <dig> . in all cases, the best scores were observed with sequences located in the l. major chromosome  <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes molecular features of the sider2s found in the l. major chromosome  <dig>  remarkably, it was observed an extremely high conservation, both in sequence and genomic location, of the sider2s found in the l. major and l. infantum chromosomes  <dig>  to avoid confusion, following the genetic nomenclature directions for kinetoplastids  <cit> , we named the l. major elements as lmjsider <dig>  in an independent study, bringaud et al  <cit>  identified  <dig> sider2s elements in the l. major chromosome. except for small variations in the coordinates, there was a total correspondence between the  <dig> elements identified by us  and those identified by bringaud and colleagues. our analysis failed to find the lmjsider <dig> starting at position  <dig>  <cit> .

recently, the completion of the l. braziliensis genome sequence has been announced  <cit> , and we considered of interest to search for the existence of these elements in this species. first analyses indicated that sider <dig> sequences indeed exist in the l. braziliensis genome, but the distribution of the elements in the chromosome  <dig> was not conserved regarding the conspicuous conservation of sider <dig> elements that exists between l. infantum and l. major chromosome  <dig>  thus, blast searches using the lisider <dig> sequences from chromosome  <dig> showed that best scores were not with sequences from l. braziliensis chromosome  <dig>  rather, bestfits for each lisider2- <dig> sequence were found with sequences distributed among the different l. braziliensis chromosomes, indicating that sider2s are not chromosome specific for all leishmania species. however, the intrachromosomal organization of these elements in the l. braziliensis genome showed features similar to that found in the other two leishmania species. thus, most of the  <dig> lbsider <dig> elements, which were identified in the l. braziliensis chromosome  <dig>  can be grouped, according to sequence homology, in subfamilies , whose members also show a relationship of proximity .

athe elements are named with the chromosome number  and the position according the contig lbrm <dig>  sequence; d and r denote that the element is located on the plus or minus strand, respectively.

in addition to the analysis of leishmania genome databases, we performed searches looking for sider <dig> homologue elements in general databases . a large number of entries were retrieved; however, all entries contained leishmania sequences and homologous sequences were not found in other organisms, with an intriguing exception. thus, we found a significant homology between lisider-32-121058d and the embl entry with accession number am <dig>  which corresponds to a lutzomyia longipalpis est clone nsfm-162h <dig>  remarkably, this sandfly species acts as leishmania transmission vector. on the other hand, blast searches in the t. cruzi and t. brucei genome databases  yielded not results, indicating that these elements are specific for the leishmania genus. among the retrieved entries from the embl and genbank databases, there are sequences derived from l. amazonensis , l. braziliensis , l. donovani , l. hoogstraali , l. infantum , l. major , l. mexicana , and l. tarentolae . remarkably, there exist many entries corresponding to l. chagasi cdnas  that have significant blast scores with sider <dig> sequences.

the bioinformatics analysis indicated that sider <dig> elements are widespread among the different leishmania species. in order to obtain experimental evidence, southern blots containing sali-digested genomic dna from l. infantum, l. major, l. tropica, l. mexicana and l. braziliensis were probed with two different lisider2s, lisider2-32-121058r and lisider2-20-575257d . complex hybridization patterns were obtained with each one of the probes, confirming the repeated nature of the sider <dig> elements. the hybridizations patterns are also in agreement with a scattered distribution of these elements in the leishmania genome. although, differences were observed in the signal intensity of particular bands among the different leishmania species, the global hybridization signal was found very similar, suggesting that a similar number of sider2s elements must be present in the different species tested.

discussion
in a recent work, bringaud and co-workers  <cit>  identified two related families of small elements by a bioinformatics analysis of the l. major genome sequence using as bait the "79-bp signature" common to trypanosomatid retroposons  <cit> . these families, named lmsider <dig> and lmsider <dig>  contain  <dig> and  <dig> copies per haploid genome, respectively. these authors raised a compelling hypothesis: these elements are extinct retroposons that have been recycled to accomplish regulatory functions for gene expression in leishmania. here, we describe the existence of this class of elements in the genome of l. infantum and other leishmania species. the starting point of our work was the isolation from a macroarray of a clone showing strong hybridization signal when l. infantum total dna was used as probe. sequencing of this clone indicated that it contains a genomic fragment of chromosome  <dig>  but the bioinformatics analyses showed also that this clone would contain a repeated sequence because significant homology with different sequences located on the different l. infantum chromosomes was observed. after a thoughtful analysis, we identified a total of  <dig> elements in the l. infantum chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> elements in the chromosome  <dig>  sequence comparisons analysis between the repeated elements identified in this work with those described by bringaud and co-workers in l. major, suggest that the elements described here belong to the sider <dig> family  <cit> .

sider <dig> elements show outstanding features regarding genomic organization : i) the elements are abundant and distributed along the different chromosomes in all leishmania species; ii) the elements constitutes subfamilies related in sequence and genomic vicinity; iii) the l. major and l. infantum sider2s are highly conserved both in sequence and chromosomal location. this degree of conservation in chromosomal location is not maintained between the l. major/l. infantum and l. braziliensis sider2s . it should be kept in mind that l. braziliensis is the most genetically and biologically divergent of the three species analyzed for this study  <cit> . a remarkable difference, which may be related with the variations in genomic distribution of sider <dig> elements among the leishmania species, is that l. braziliensis possesses potentially active retrotransposons that are absent in the other two leishmania species  <cit> .

accumulating data from different organisms do indicate that mobile elements and non-coding repetitive sequences are important elements in a genome and may be playing functional roles that vary from control of gene expression to chromosomal organization  <cit> . in this regard, the sequence features and genomic organization of sider <dig> elements are suggestive of relevant functional roles, but what kind of function can they be playing? the search for these elements within coding regions in l. infantum predicted genes indicates that no sider <dig> sequences are in coding region. the sole exception to this rule is the l. infantum database entry linj10_v <dig> , which contains sequence homology to sider2s. however, this entry is considered as pseudogene, since its sequence contains several in-frame stop codons. remarkably, this putative pseudogene shows high sequence conservation with genes containing uninterrupted orf in other kinetoplatids: lmjf <dig>  , lbrm10_v <dig>  , tc <dig> . <dig>  and tb <dig> . <dig> . in spite of this particular finding, as overall conclusion, it must be stated that sider <dig> elements are rare in coding sequences.

on the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that sider <dig> elements are frequently found in untranslated regions  of genes, mainly 3'utrs. using both bioinformatics and experimental approaches, bringaud et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that sider <dig> elements are present in 3-utrs of many different genes. furthermore, these authors showed experimental evidence that sider <dig> sequences are promoting downregulation of mrna steady state levels. in addition, our database analyses showed that several l. chagasi cdnas have sider <dig> sequences, reinforcing the idea that these elements are frequently found in utrs of mrnas, playing putative regulatory role in gene expression.

extrachromosomal dna amplifications are commonly observed in different leishmania species either after drug pressure or even in natural isolates  <cit> . when parasites are subjected to selective stresses, appropriate genomic dna regions, containing flanking repeats, are amplified as extrachromosomal structures. according to the beverley's model for explaining dna amplification phenomena, the leishmania genome should contain amplification-prone cassettes  <cit> . thus, the genomic organization of sider <dig> elements in the leishmania chromosomes  could be related with the amplification mechanism. interestingly, another prediction of the model is the existence of two types of cassettes, those flanked by direct repeats and those flanked by inverted repeats. sider <dig> elements are found in both direct and inverted orientations, which further suggest their possible implication in leishmania dna amplification. in order to find additional cues supporting this idea, we looked for sider <dig> sequences in characterized dna amplification structures of leishmania. remarkably, sider <dig> related sequences were found in several genbank and embl entries corresponding to leishmania dna amplification structures. for example, three repeated sequences  were identified in close proximity to the recombination points of extrachromosomal linear dna amplicons m <dig> and m <dig> of l. major  <cit> . schematic drawings for m <dig> and m <dig> amplicons, and for the genomic region of the source chromosome are depicted in figure 6a. both amplicons have an inverted repeat structure, and the inversion occurred between repeats rs <dig> and rs <dig> for m <dig>  and between rs <dig> and rs <dig> for m <dig>  the three repeated sequences are 374-bp in size and show a high level of sequence identity   <cit> . these repeated sequences have a remarkable homology with lisider <dig> sequences , suggesting that they are members of an lmjsider <dig> subfamily. in other example, the repeated sequences, postulated to be involved in the formation of a linear amplicon in l. tarentolae  <cit> , also share significant sequence homology with lisider <dig> elements. these data suggest that indeed sider <dig> elements could be involved in the generation of some leishmania extrachromosomal amplification.

our search on genbank and embl databases showed the existence of sider <dig> elements in other relevant leishmania genomic regions. for example, homology to sider <dig> sequences is found in a 44-kb genomic region, which was involved in mitotic stability of extrachromoses in l. donovani  <cit> . to date, the dna elements participating in the chromosomal replication and segregation processes are largely unknown in leishmania and other trypanosomatids. the difficulty to uncover the centromeres in trypanosomatids could be pointing to the existence of holocentric chromosomes that are characterized by the presence of a diffuse or nonlocalized centromere during mitosis  <cit> . in this scenario, sider <dig> elements should be considered as candidates for centromeric sequences. this hypothesis is based on two features of sider <dig> elements: they are distributed regularly along the chromosomes  and they have g+c-rich sequences. richness in g+c-sequences is observed in centromeres and pericentromic regions of many organisms  <cit> . also, it is noticeable the existence, within the sider <dig> sequences, of g-rich tracts that are known for their propensity to form g-quadruplex dna structures  <cit> .

finally, the presence of the "79-bp signature" in a large proportion of the sider <dig> elements may be suggestive of a transcriptional role for this class of repeats. in a previous report, we have demonstrated that the "79-bp signature" , derived from t. cruzi l1tc non-ltr retrotransposon has a rna-pol ii-dependent promoter that strongly activates gene transcription  <cit> . in this context, it may be postulated that sider2s bearing the "79-bp signature" could be acting as rna-pol ii recruiting points to enhance the transcriptional active at some chromosomal regions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe several features of a family of novel repeated elements  that are interspersed along the different chromosomes and present in all leishmania species. we show an in-depth analysis of these elements in the l. infantum chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and in the l. major and l. braziliensis chromosomes  <dig>  apart from their proved role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in leishmania, our analyses suggest that sider <dig> elements could be involved in dna amplification phenomena and, perhaps, they can represent centromeric sequences of holocentric chromosomes. in summary, sider <dig> elements constitute a relevant piece of the leishmania genome organization, and this work provides a framework for investigating the functions of these sequences.
