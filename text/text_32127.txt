BACKGROUND
papillomaviruses  are a group of small, non-encapsulated epitheliotropic dna viruses. pvs infect basal keratinocytes and cause benign proliferative lesions, termed papillomas, on the surface of cutaneous and mucosal tissues  <cit> . a subset of pvs are associated with the development of epithelial malignancies, such as cervical carcinomas, oral squamous cell carcinomas  and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas  in humans  <cit> . the genomes of pvs are circular and double-stranded and contain up to  <dig> viral genes that are classified as early  or late  based on their temporal pattern of expression. early genes encode regulatory proteins that function in viral replication , viral shedding , or transformation   <cit> , whereas late genes  encode viral capsid proteins   <cit> . pvs are strictly species-specific and have been identified in a wide variety of vertebrates, including mammals, birds and recently reptiles  <cit> . genome sequencing of several pvs and nucleotide sequence comparisons led to the development of a pv classification scheme based on l <dig> sequence identity and helped elucidate the evolutionary relationships among pvs isolated from a variety of species  <cit> .

due to their known association with human neoplasias, human papillomaviruses  have been extensively studied, thereby increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral oncogenesis and revealing additional factors that contribute to the development of malignancies. the finding that immune-deficient  or immune-suppressed  individuals harbor higher numbers of high-risk pvs underscores the importance of immune function in the reactivation of latent infection and possibly in hpv induced oncogenesis  <cit> .

feline-specific pvs belong to the lambda-papillomavirus genus and consist of mucosal and cutaneous types  <cit> . in the domestic cat , pv infection has been associated with a number of skin lesions such as squamous cell carcinoma, bowenoid in-situ carcinoma, viral plaques and sarcoids  <cit> . pv associated disease is of particular interest in wild endangered felids, where these viruses have been isolated from oral papillomatous lesions in the florida panther , bobcat , asian lion , snow leopard  and the clouded leopard   <cit> . sequencing and nucleotide comparisons of the lrpv <dig>  pcpv <dig>  plppv <dig> and uupv <dig> genomes provided insight into their genomic organization, their evolutionary relationships and the mechanism of pv-host co-speciation  <cit> . sequence comparisons of uupv <dig> genes to those of pvs in the alpha and beta genera revealed that uupv <dig> is more similar to beta-pvs  which are associated with latent infections that become reactivated under immunosuppression, than to high-risk alpha pvs , which are associated with malignancies  <cit> .

until recently, diagnosis of pv infection in snow leopards and other wild felids has depended upon observation and histopathology of papillomatous lesions. oral papillomas in snow leopards are commonly seen under the tongue and appear as small, pale nodules . very little is known about snow leopard immune responses to pv infection, and relatively few molecular tools are available to facilitate their study. interpretation of serological tests for papillomavirus antibodies can be problematic. as with hpv infections, positive antibody tests in snow leopards probably indicate exposure but not necessarily current infection; pv antibodies may be present for several months after the virus has been cleared. false negative results are also possible because seroconversion to the major coat protein, l <dig>  may be delayed for as much as  <dig> months after initiation of persistent infections, or may not occur at all  <cit> . epithelial infections with pvs are rarely accompanied by inflammation, the viruses are non-lytic, viral capsid proteins are differentially expressed in keratinocytes and at very low levels in less mature cells, and the basal lamina of the epithelium remains intact, effectively allowing pvs to replicate without stimulating innate or adaptive immune responses  <cit> . additionally, pvs can evade immune responses by establishing latent persistent infections, integrating into the host cell genome, or initiating a multitude of other defense mechanisms  <cit> .

for endangered captive species such as the snow leopard, immune function is an important trait. in order to better understand how individual variation in snow leopard immune function relates to papillomavirus infection, appropriate molecular tools must be developed to study uupv <dig> infection and its impact on the health and survival of endangered felids. in the current study, we report the development of a pcr-based assay that detects the e <dig> and e <dig> viral oncogenes in the saliva of snow leopards. this assay can be utilized as a novel molecular tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying infection and the development and progression of pv induced disease in this endangered species.

RESULTS
design of a pcr strategy to amplify papillomavirus dna
we used the published genome sequence of uupv <dig>   <cit>  to design pcr primers that amplify viral dna . the e <dig> and e <dig> genes present ideal targets for viral dna detection for a number of reasons. first, e <dig> and e <dig> are the key genes involved in the interaction of papillomavirus with host cell cycle pathways and are also the target of pcr-based assays that detect hpv- <dig> dna in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma   <cit> , suggesting that e <dig> and e <dig> can be successfully amplified from clinical samples. additionally, even in cases when pv integrates into the host genome and a number of viral genes are lost, e <dig> and e <dig> may be the only genes that remain intact  <cit> . therefore, a pcr strategy focusing on e <dig> and e <dig> maximizes the probability of identifying viral dna in a variety of snow leopard specimens corresponding to different stages of disease progression. we designed two sets of primers that amplify the full-length e <dig> and e <dig> genes as two separate pcr products . the two primer pairs are positioned such that the e <dig> and e <dig> pcr products overlap by  <dig> nucleotides, which allows us to confirm dna sequence information from two independent pcr products as an additional internal control. the e <dig> primers anneal at genomic positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , and amplify a 694-bp fragment encompassing the entire e <dig> coding region , and the first  <dig> bp of the e <dig> gene . the e <dig> primers anneal at genomic positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  and produce a 472-bp fragment, that contains the last  <dig> bp of the e <dig> gene and the entire e <dig> coding region.

pcr amplification of viral dna from snow leopard saliva
because papillomatous lesions occur within the snow leopard oral cavity  <cit> , we wanted to determine whether saliva represents an appropriate biological specimen for the detection of papillomavirus dna in asymptomatic animals. additionally, since saliva collection can be performed in a non-invasive manner, behavioral modification techniques can be used to train animals to calmly accept an oral swab without the need for chemical restraint. in this fashion, we were able to obtain saliva samples from snow leopards in their enclosure, thus minimizing anxiety to the animals and without introducing them into stress-provoking situations . this is particularly important for captive species that are not routinely subjected to chemical restraint, and are only anesthetized for scheduled physical exams every year or every two or three years. in these cases, saliva represents a more easily and frequently accessible biological specimen than blood.

a positive result in a pcr-based assay would indicate presence of the virus in the oral cavity of the animal, as opposed to a serological test which can indicate exposure, but not necessarily current infection. we obtained matched saliva and blood samples from three snow leopards that did not have oral papillomatous lesions: two adult females that were approximately  <dig> years old , and a 7-week old female cub . we used the e <dig> and e <dig> primer pairs in amplification reactions using dna purified from the paired blood and saliva samples . we obtained amplification products of the expected size for both e <dig>  and e <dig>  using saliva from the two adult snow leopards  but not from the cub . additionally, we were unable to detect viral dna for e <dig> and e <dig> in dna purified from the matched blood samples of the two adult snow leopards . this was not due to the absence of dna in any of the saliva or blood samples, since we successfully amplified a 503-bp product corresponding to the coding region of the snow leopard transferrin receptor  as a positive control . additional saliva samples obtained from two snow leopards at another facility were negative for e <dig> and e <dig> dna .

validation of the e <dig> and e <dig> pcr products by restriction digest and dna sequencing
since restriction digests provide a fast and cost-effective method to rapidly screen pcr products, we developed a restriction endonuclease digestion assay of the amplification products to confirm that they correspond to the e <dig> and e <dig> viral genes. the restriction enzyme taqi cleaves the e <dig> pcr product twice, producing three fragments of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp . the e <dig> pcr product contains three rsai restriction sites, yielding two large fragments  and two smaller fragments . digestion of the e <dig> pcr products obtained from the saliva of the two older snow leopards  produced a doublet corresponding to the  <dig> and 279-bp fragments and a single 127-bp fragment . similarly, incubation of the e <dig> amplification products from these animals with rsai yielded two fragments of the expected size .

as an independent measure to confirm their identity, we gel purified the e <dig> and e <dig> pcr products from the two animals and subjected them to bi-directional dna sequencing. the sequencing results were assembled into contigs and aligned to the consensus genome sequence of uupv <dig> . the multiple sequence alignment in figure  <dig> shows that the sequence of the e <dig> and e <dig> amplification products obtained from saliva is 100% identical to the published uupv <dig> genome sequence for e <dig> and e <dig> 

these two validation methods independently confirm the identity of the e <dig> and e <dig> amplicons. although amplicon sequencing is preferable, it is can be more expensive, time-consuming and requires significant amounts of purified pcr products, which might not always be feasible. in such cases, restriction digests provide an accurate, simple and cost-effective method to rapidly screen even large numbers of samples. the choice of two distinct validation methods in our assay provides flexibility and makes it amenable to perform in a variety of laboratory settings.

discussion
we developed a molecular assay that detects papillomavirus dna in snow leopard saliva. our method is similar to pcr-based molecular assays designed to detect different types of human papillomavirus  in a variety of clinical samples  <cit> . specifically, presence of hpv- <dig> in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  biopsies is determined by amplification of the e <dig> and e <dig> genes  <cit> . similarly, e <dig> amplification is used to detect the presence of high-risk hpv subtypes in human cutaneous neoplasms and in cervical smears  <cit> . in some cases of pv integration into host genetic material, e <dig> and e <dig> may be the only genes that remain intact  <cit> , thus making them ideal choices for pcr-based detection of viral dna.

the detection of uupv <dig> dna in the saliva of two older snow leopards parallels results from hpv studies that have demonstrated that hpv dna can be amplified from oral rinses and saliva samples from hnscc patients and hiv positive individuals  <cit> . because pvs are epitheliotropic, detection of pv dna in blood samples from infected snow leopards is unlikely  <cit> ; therefore, the absence of viral dna in blood is consistent with an expected pv replication pattern in mucosal cells with no concurrent viremia.

the utilization of a pcr-based method to detect viral dna in saliva presents a number of advantages. first, saliva collection is a non-invasive sampling method, thereby circumventing the requirement for anesthesia prior to obtaining a blood sample in captive wild felids. this is particularly important for captive species that are not routinely subjected to chemical restraint, and may only be anesthetized for scheduled physical exams. in these cases, saliva represents a more easily and frequently accessible biological specimen than blood. an additional advantage of testing saliva is that behavioral modification techniques can be used to train snow leopards and other felids to calmly accept an oral swab for dna collection without chemical restraint. in fact, we were able to collect saliva samples from snow leopards in their enclosure, with minimal disturbance to the animal. subsequently, animals testing positive for viral dna can then be scheduled for a more thorough oral examination under sedation. the use of saliva also allows for detection of the virus in the anatomical site where papillomatous lesions develop during later stages of disease progression. additionally, saliva is extremely stable, and more easily preserved than serum samples, thereby facilitating collection and shipping of samples from different sites. in testing for hpv, it has been demonstrated that pcr-based methods have increased sensitivity as compared to serotesting  <cit> , and can accommodate even lower quality samples, such as archival samples and paraffin-embedded specimens  <cit> . in contrast to seropositivity which can indicate a present and ongoing infection or a past infection that has been cleared, a positive pcr test indicates a current infection in the oral cavity of the animal. therefore, pcr-based testing of snow leopard saliva can complement serotesting and help provide a more accurate picture of an animal's disease status.

pcr-based detection of papillomavirus e <dig> and e <dig> dna in the saliva of snow leopards may have utility in diagnosing infection in animals that have no obvious oral papillomatous lesions, confirming infection in cats with oral papillomas, and detecting infection in animals that have not yet seroconverted. due to its non-invasiveness and ease of implementation, pcr-based testing of saliva can be incorporated into the routine and regular screening of captive snow leopards, which would greatly facilitate the collection of epidemiological data on uupv <dig> infections. additionally, since papillomatous lesions have been reported to progress to scc in snow leopards  <cit> , our assay can also be used to determine whether viral dna is present in biopsy samples of sccs to explore the relationship between uupv <dig> infection and neoplasia and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of pv induced disease.

the finding that uupv <dig> dna is present in the saliva of two adult snow leopards that have no current or documented lesions is intriguing. the most likely explanation for our finding is supported by the advanced age of these animals and the fact that saliva was collected following euthanasia due to progressive illness. papillomaviruses can establish latent or low-level inapparent infections, remaining undetected for long periods of time  <cit> , and these cats may have been experiencing reactivation of a previously controlled pv infection. it is also possible, although unlikely, that these animals had recently become infected, and pv induced disease was not manifested at the time of death.

one of the goals of conservation biology is to maintain genetically diverse captive populations of endangered species. in relatively small populations, like the 150- <dig> captive snow leopards in north america, it is critical to develop functional assays for assessing individual differences in health and fitness. one such difference is an animal's susceptibility to pv infection and to the development of pv associated disease. in the current study, we demonstrate that viral dna is present in the saliva of clinically normal animals. therefore, our assay can be used to classify clinically normal snow leopards into pv-positive and pv-negative populations, which, along with clinical data, can be studied to identify both genetic and environmental factors underlying susceptibility to viral infection and to the development and progression of disease. similar studies in humans have identified specific variants in immune genes as well as in genes that interact with viral proteins and demonstrated that these variants are associated with an individual's risk for viral persistence and with the subsequent development of disease  <cit> .

the conservation of endangered captive species requires maintaining the genetic diversity of the population. when captive populations suffer from inbreeding depression, fitness decreases and mortality rates may increase along with decreased reproductive success and impaired immune function  <cit> . genetic studies in small populations of endangered species are challenging because standard approaches like large-scale genetic association studies are not possible. instead, genetic approaches must focus on individuals and place the emphasis on developing effective means of characterizing phenotypes which can be used to study phenotypic variation across the captive population. in the case of the snow leopard, the well-documented infection of animals with papillomavirus  <cit>  offers an opportunity to develop robust phenotyping methods for assessing immune function within the captive population. unfortunately, relatively little is known about snow leopard susceptibility and resistance to papillomavirus infection and disease progression. in order to better understand the potential phenotypic variation underlying susceptibility and resistance to viral infection, it is critical that molecular tools be developed that can allow investigators to begin characterizing how phenotypes associated with papilomavirus infection and disease progression vary across closely and distantly related individuals. the pcr assay we describe is a first step in this direction. this assay can be used to  monitor the exposure of individual snow leopards to papillomavirus,  accurately identify which snow leopards are positive and which are negative for papillomavirus,  characterize the relationship between papillomavirus exposure and the development of oral papillomatous lesions,  investigate the relationship between exposure and infection when uninfected snow leopards are housed with infected snow leopards and,  determine the timeline underlying subclinical infection and presentation of clinical signs. as more snow leopards participate in these studies, distributions describing these traits for the entire captive population can be produced. subsequently, individuals exhibiting phenotypes at the tails of the distributions can be identified and further studies aimed at characterizing the genetic basis of snow leopard immunity in captivity can be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a novel pcr strategy to detect papillomavirus in the snow leopard. using this assay, we successfully amplified the e <dig> and e <dig> viral oncogenes in dna purified from saliva of two snow leopards. dna sequencing verified that the amplified fragments indeed represent the e <dig> and e <dig> genes of uupv <dig>  in addition, we demonstrated that viral dna cannot be detected in paired blood samples from these animals, which is consistent with the mechanism of papillomavirus infection and viral lifecycle in the host. taken together with the non-invasiveness, and ease of collection relative to blood, our results further underscore the utility of saliva as a suitable clinical specimen for the detection of papillomavirus in snow leopards. our findings allow for the development of a molecular tool to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of pv induced disease in this endangered species.
