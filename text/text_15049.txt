BACKGROUND
delivery of compounds to the brain and retina has been an immense challenge in the development of therapeutic drugs and imaging agents  <cit> . although there are several active internalization mechanisms that can shuttle necessary nutrients into the brain and retina, internalization of molecules is restricted by the blood-brain barrier  and blood-retinal barrier , respectively, which maintain homeostasis of these organs  <cit> . an important constituent of the bbb and brb is the physical barrier formed by tight junctions between endothelial cells to seal the vascular lumen. the penetration of hydrophilic solutes via the intercellular cleft is severely restricted by the tight junction barrier and only lipophilic compounds with low molecular weight can passively diffuse into the brain and retina by a transcellular route  <cit> . however, most lipophilic molecules that diffuse into the brain and retina are eliminated by active efflux transporters such as p-glycoprotein , multidrug resistance proteins , and breast cancer resistance protein   <cit> . since these efflux transporters have broad substrate spectrums, most endogenous and exogenous lipophilic molecules are unable to reach the brain. indeed, over 98% of small molecules intended for therapeutic use in the central nervous system never reach the market because of their inherent inability to cross the bbb  <cit> .

simple and reliable in vivo assays are important to identify compounds that can permeate the bbb and brb. a number of techniques are available for in vivo measurement of brain uptake, including methods based on equilibrium studies between the blood and brain, and methods based on kinetic parameters  <cit> . the equilibrium distribution of a compound between the blood and brain is defined as the ratio of the concentration in the brain and blood   <cit> . this parameter depends upon passive diffusion characteristics, transporters at the bbb, metabolism, and differences between the relative drug binding affinity of plasma proteins and brain tissues. although logbb measurements provide important information about brain permeability, they usually require several animals per time-point and are therefore costly and labor intensive  <cit> . positron emission tomography has been shown to be a noninvasive, quantitative approach for evaluating kinetic parameters of the uptake of compounds by the brain through the capture of multi-dimensional images in real time  <cit> . however, the preparation and stability of tracers are matters of concern  <cit> . therefore, if in vivo assays for the assessment of the permeability of the bbb and brb to a compound can be performed in a high-throughput manner, identification of compounds that can easily cross these barriers will be accelerated. furthermore, the large amount of data obtained from a high-throughput assay can be used for in silico analysis, which has been extensively developed and can greatly contribute to designing and predicting compounds able to cross the bbb and brb.

recent developments in combinatorial chemistry have enabled the construction of a diversity-oriented fluorescence chemical library  <cit> . it has been shown that subtle structural modifications in a compound can alter brain permeability  <cit> . in this study, we prepared six structurally related fluorescent indoline derivatives  as a minimum set of diverse fluorescent compounds and evaluated their ability to cross the bbb and brb in live zebrafish larvae. the bbb and brb of zebrafish are structurally and functionally similar to those of mammals  <cit> . furthermore, zebrafish have been used successfully to find fluorescent compounds that permeate the brb  <cit> . thus, we used different transparent zebrafish lines to assess the permeability of the bbb and brb to these fluorescent ids in vivo. we subsequently focused on the substrate specificity of mrps to identify the structural factors influencing the permeability of the bbb and brb.

RESULTS
permeability of the bbb to fluorescent ids in live zebrafish larvae
the structures and fluorescent properties of ids used in this study are shown in table  <dig>  three ids  of different molecular sizes were prepared from 1-ethylindoline. the compounds shared a common rhodanine ring with an acetic acid group. in addition, we prepared related ids with a propanoic acid group instead of an acetic acid group .

mw, molecular weight; clogp, calculated octanol/water partition coefficient; ex, maximum fluorescence excitation; em, maximum fluorescence emission; fi, fluorescence intensity.

to examine bbb permeability, we stained zebrafish larvae at 7- <dig> days post fertilization  by immersion in medium containing either one of the six ids or fluorescein . we focused on the fluorescence signal at the optic tectum , which is a multilaminated structure with a dense neuropil in which tectal cell dendrites receive synapses from many neurons  <cit>  . other than in the cerebral blood vessels , no obvious fluorescence was observed in the ot in zebrafish stained with zmb <dig>  zmc <dig> or zmj <dig>  each of which possesses a rhodanine ring with an acetic acid group . while the overall fluorescence signal was extremely low in zebrafish stained with zmb <dig> , weak fluorescence was observed in the cbv of zebrafish stained with zmc <dig> , and strong fluorescence was observed in those stained with zmj <dig> . the fluorescence signal in the cbv of zebrafish stained with zmj <dig> was much higher than that of zmc <dig>  in contrast to the staining with the ids containing a rhodanine ring with an acetic acid group, fluorescence signals were observed in both the ot and cbv in zebrafish stained with zmc <dig>  zmb <dig> and zmb <dig>  all of which contained a rhodanine ring with a propanoic acid group . the intensity of the fluorescence signal in the cbv and ot from weakest to strongest was obtained with zmc808 < zmb740 < zmb <dig>  this order is consistent with that of the fluorescence intensity  of these dyes , suggesting that the intensity of the fluorescence signal in vivo reflects the fi of each dye. another possibility is that zmb <dig> and zmc <dig> might be the derivatives most and least absorbed by zebrafish, respectively. neither the ot nor the cbv were stained with fluorescein .

permeability of the brb to fluorescent ids in live zebrafish larvae
since the brb and bbb basically share the same barrier system, it is reasonable to assume that compounds that can permeate the bbb can also permeate the brb. to examine this possibility, we performed in vivo imaging of zebrafish retinas stained with the six fluorescent ids with a rhodanine ring with an acetic acid group or a propanoic acid group . we focused on the fluorescence signal in the hyaloid blood vessels  and the multiple layers of the retina . in the hbv, a strong fluorescence signal was detected in zmj018-stained retinas , a weak signal in zmc213-stained retinas , and no signal in zmb996-stained retinas . no obvious fluorescence signal was observed in the multiple retinal layers in zebrafish stained with zmb <dig> , zmc <dig> , or zmj <dig> .

fluorescence signals were observed in both the hbv and the multiple retinal layers in zebrafish exposed to fluorescent ids with a rhodanine ring with a propanoic acid group . in zebrafish retina stained with zmb <dig>  and zmb <dig> , fluorescence signals were observed in the inner and outer plexiform layers  and the photoreceptor cell layer , whereas fluorescence in the ganglion cell layer , inner nuclear layer , and outer nuclear layer  appeared reticulated. the ipl and opl are synaptic layers that contain neuronal projections from the inl and gcl, and from the onl and inl, respectively. the strong fluorescence signals observed in the ipl and opl  of zebrafish stained with zmb <dig> were consistent with strong fluorescence in the ot where there is an accumulation of synapses . the fluorescence signal was weak in zebrafish stained with zmc <dig> , which is also consistent with the weak zmc808-mediated fluorescence signal in the ot . these results suggest that the permeability of the brb to fluorescent ids is similar to that of the bbb.

validation of bbb permeability to zmb <dig> and zmbj <dig> administered by intracardiac injection
administration of compounds by immersion might be problematic because the method is likely to be limited to fish and amphibian models. also, it is not clear whether compounds first enter the blood and then translocate across the bbb and brb to the brain and retina, respectively. to circumvent these problems, we performed intracardiac injection of zmb <dig> or zmj <dig> into zebrafish larvae and assessed the permeability of the bbb to these ids. as shown in figure  <dig>  fluorescence signal in the ot was clearly present in zebrafish injected with zmb <dig>  but not with zmj <dig>  the ratio of fi measured in the ot and the cbv of zebrafish injected with zmb <dig> increased from  <dig> to  <dig> min after injection and was significantly higher than that in zebrafish injected with zmj <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> min . these results suggest that the permeability of the bbb to ids is consistent regardless of either method of exposure.

assessment of the structural factors influencing the substrate specificity of mrps
efflux of compounds from the brain endothelium is initiated at the luminal membrane where atp-binding cassette  transporters, including mrps, bcrp, and pgp, are the major efflux transporters. mrps and bcrp largely mediate the efflux of anionic compounds, whereas pgp mediates mainly the efflux of lipophilic neutral and cationic compounds. according to previous work, mrps are expressed in various zebrafish organs, including the brain and eyes  <cit> . because the ids examined in this study are organic anionic compounds, we examined the effect of the inhibition of mrps on the permeability of the bbb and brb to zmj <dig>  to inhibit mrps, we used mk <dig>  a selective inhibitor of mrps that inhibits the activity of mrps expressed in zebrafish fibroblast-like cells  <cit> . fluorescence signal in the cbv and hbv was observed after staining with zmj <dig> alone . in addition to the cbv and hbv, fluorescence signal was also detected in the ot and multiple layers of the retina in zebrafish stained with zmj <dig> in the presence of mk <dig> . the fi in the ot of zebrafish treated with both zmj <dig> and mk <dig> was significantly higher than in those treated with zmj <dig> alone . the fi in the hbv was similar regardless of mk <dig> treatment . the ratio of fi in the ot and the hbv in zebrafish treated with both zmj <dig> and mk <dig> was also significantly higher than in those treated with zmj <dig> alone . these results suggest that zmj <dig> is recognized as a substrate and eliminated from the bbb and brb by mrps.

discussion
zebrafish as a useful in vivo model for the assessment of bbb and brb permeability to fluorescent compounds
the zebrafish has been shown to be a useful animal model for studying mechanisms of human disease  <cit> , drug discovery for the treatment of human diseases  <cit> , and chemical toxicity  <cit> . zebrafish have also been used to research in vivo fluorescent imaging agents for the visualization of specific tissues  <cit> . accumulating evidence showing similarities between the zebrafish and human bbb and brb indicates that the zebrafish is a useful research model for studying the development, maintenance, and function of the bbb and brb in vertebrates  <cit> . jeong and collaborators  <cit>  injected fitc-dextran  and rhodamine-dextran  into zebrafish as extraneous markers. xie and colleagues  <cit>  generated a transgenic zebrafish line that expressed a vitamin d binding protein fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein  in blood plasma as an endogenous tracer. these groups analyzed the leakage of these fluorescent macromolecules from blood vessels and showed that the zebrafish bbb and brb, which are regulated by tight junction proteins, develop by  <dig> dpf  <cit> .

while similarities exists between the zebrafish and mammalian bbb and brb  <cit> , the contribution of efflux transporters to the function of the zebrafish bbb and brb is not yet clear. genes encoding zebrafish homologues of mrps , mdr , and bcrp  have been identified in the zebrafish genome  <cit> . it has also been shown that abcc <dig> mrna is moderately expressed in the brain and eyes of zebrafish  <cit> . the present study revealed that treating zebrafish with mk <dig>  a selective inhibitor of mrps including abcc <dig>  <cit> , significantly increased the fi of zmj <dig> staining in both the brain and retina without changing the fi in the cbv and hbv. these results suggest that zmj <dig> is recognized as a substrate and eliminated from the bbb and brb by mrps. thus, efflux transporters in the bbb and brb may function in zebrafish in a similar manner to those of higher vertebrates. furthermore, the permeability of a fluorescent id administered by simple immersion was comparable to that administered by intracardiac injection, supporting the validity of administration of fluorescent compounds to zebrafish by simple immersion for the assessment of bbb and brb permeability. used together with a diversity-oriented fluorescence chemical library  <cit> , the combination of these zebrafish-based assays could generate a large amount of information regarding the relationships between the chemical structure and permeability of the bbb and brb. such relationships are critical to the development of clinical drugs and imaging agents targeting brain and retina  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that zebrafish are an excellent model for the analysis of the permeability of the bbb and brb to fluorescent compounds, and that this permeability is mediated through efflux transporters.

fluorescent ids as useful compounds for the assessment of bbb and brb permeability
fluorescent compounds have been used for assay systems focusing on the interactions of efflux transporters of the bbb in rodent models  <cit> . fluorescein, a substrate of mrps, has been used to assess the function of mrps and the effects of inhibitors of mrps by measuring fluorescence intensity in rat brain via micro dialysis  <cit> . it has also been shown that rhodamine  <dig>  a substrate of pgp, can be used to assess the activity of pgp in mouse brain by imaging techniques  <cit> . these findings suggest that fluorescent substrates of efflux transporters are useful for examining the function of transporters in the bbb and brb in combination with inhibitors of these transporters. if these fluorescent compounds have multiple sites for structural modification that might change their affinity to bind to the transporters, one can reveal important structural features that regulate the permeability of the bbb and brb. in this study, we took advantage of the indoline scaffold whose structure can be flexibly modified, and prepared six ids by combining three indoline scaffolds of different sizes and rhodanine derivatives with either acetic acid or propanoic acid. indoline and rhodanine alone are not fluorescent but the rhodanine ring attached to the indoline scaffold exhibits fluorescence with relatively large stokes shift  <cit> .

we performed in vivo fluorescence imaging of these ids to analyze the permeability across the bbb and brb in zebrafish. these ids were absorbed into the zebrafish from the medium, whereas fluorescein was not. it has been shown that zebrafish can absorb chemicals efficiently from medium into the body when the logp  exceeds  <dig>  <cit> . this may be the reason why hydrophilic fluorescein was not absorbed by the zebrafish. in contrast, the calculated logp  of the ids ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  the fluorescence signal of the ids in the cbv of living zebrafish corresponded well with their clogp, suggesting that the quantities of these ids absorbed in zebrafish may be correlated with their clogp. although the lipophilicityof compounds is also an important determinant of their ability to cross the bbb and brb by passive diffusion  <cit> , the lipophilicity of the compounds tested in this study did not correspond with their clogp. for example, although a strong fluorescence signal was observed in the cbv and hbv of zebrafish stained with zmj <dig>  there was no obvious fluorescence signal in the ot and the multiple layers of retina. in contrast, both the ot and the multiple layers of retina were clearly visualized in zebrafish stained with zmb <dig> whose clogp is very similar to that of zmj <dig>  these results suggest that the movement of zmj <dig> and zmb <dig> across the bbb and brb may be regulated by mechanisms other than passive diffusion.

pharmacological intervention using a selective inhibitor of mrps  suggested that mrps pump zmj <dig> across the bbb and brb from the brain and retina, respectively, to the blood in zebrafish. comparison of the chemical structure of zmj <dig> and zmb <dig> suggests that the number of methylene moieties in the terminal carboxylic acid group attached to the rhodanine ring may be critical for recognition by mrps. in general, the acidity of carboxylic acid moieties becomes higher as the alkyl substituent becomes shorter. thus, the acidity of zmj <dig> may be higher than that of zmb <dig> because zmj <dig> contains a shorter methylene moiety. therefore, the recognition of zmj <dig> by mrps may be greater than that of zmb <dig> because mrps mainly recognize anionic compounds as substrates. alternatively, the affinity of mrps for zmb <dig> may be less than for zmj <dig> if the dissociation rate of the proton from the terminal carboxylic acid is low. our preliminary study revealed that fluorescence signals in the cbv, hbv, and ot were similar between zebrafish treated only with zmb <dig>  and zebrafish treated with zmb <dig> and mk <dig>  suggesting that mrps may have a low affinity for zmb <dig>  further studies are required to confirm the interaction between mrps and these ids.

in summary, it is possible to synthesize a diversity-oriented library of fluorescent ids because the substructures can be flexibly modified. these fluorescent ids can be applied to the zebrafish-based assay because they have a good balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity and can be absorbed into zebrafish from the medium. thus, the permeability of the bbb and brb to a large number of fluorescent ids can be assessed using this zebrafish-based assay.

CONCLUSIONS
we were able to demonstrate that in vivo assessment of the permeability of fluorescent ids across the bbb and brb could be simply and reliably performed using zebrafish. the substructures of ids can be modified flexibly and, thus, the ability of a large number of ids to cross the bbb and brb can be assessed using this zebrafish-based assay. the large amount of data acquired from the assay might be useful for in silico analysis to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the interactions between chemical structures and the efflux transporters of the bbb and brb. a better understanding of the interactions between chemical structures and these efflux transporters will hopefully in turn lead to the efficient design of compounds targeting the brain and retina.
