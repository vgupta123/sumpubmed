BACKGROUND
cell-based microarray technology was first described by ziauddin and sabatini in  <dig>  <cit>  for use in performing high throughput over-expression studies. the technique entails printing the full-length orf of genes inserted into an expression vector onto a glass microscope slide to form a microarray. the array is treated with transfection reagent and cells are grown over the top of the array until confluent. cells growing in the vicinity of the spots of packaged genes undergo transfection and the encoded protein is over-expressed. arrays can then be examined for alterations in cellular function, as manifested in localised changes to the cells' biochemistry or morphology. if the expression vector contains a 'tag', the sub-cellular localisation of the protein can also be analysed  <cit> . due to the techniques' potential for high throughput analyses and economy of reagents, cell-based microarrays for studies have now been adopted by a number of groups for a variety of applications. cell-based microarray over-expression studies have been used to discover new members of signalling pathways  <cit> , to identify new g-protein coupled receptor  targets  <cit>  and to screen single-chain antibody fragments  <cit> . comprehensive reviews on cell-based microarrays are available elsewhere  <cit> .

whilst in principle cell-based microarrays provide a powerful platform for performing high throughput transfection screens, to date no studies have reported the use of large-scale arrays and analyses have tended to focus on the over-expression of a relatively small number of genes. one factor that has limited the use of the technology to date has been the availability of suitable clone sets that contain tagged full-length orf's in mammalian expression vectors, as described in the original paper  <cit> . such clone collections are beginning to become available from commercial sources, but for most their use is prohibited by their expense and restrictions on their use. in a previous study  <cit> , we explored the use of gfp tagged genes in gateway expression vectors in the fabrication of cell-based arrays. whilst this work demonstrated the utility of using tagged clones in visualising the sub-cellular localisation of the transfected protein, it also highlighted certain limitations with this approach. for example, apart from the considerable expense and time involved in sub-cloning genes into the gateway cloning system, there is the possibility of introducing errors into the orf during the initial pcr of the cdna insert. we also demonstrated that tagging a gene can cause the protein to mis-localise and therefore disrupt the function of the native protein.

in the current study, we have therefore elected to use untagged human cdna clones from the mammalian gene collection   <cit>  for the construction of a cell-based microarray capable of screening a large number of genes. there is currently a non-redundant set of over  <dig>  sequence verified, full-length orf human clones in the mgc collection. we have constructed a reverse transfection array containing plasmid dna from  <dig>  of these clones, with each clone printed in quadruplicate. a gfp vector  was also printed to act as a transfection control and to provide a positional address for the untagged mgc clones.

apoptosis is a mechanism for regulating cell survival by which unwanted or damaged cells are induced to undergo a controlled cell death. during development, apoptosis is used to remove surplus cells and remodel tissues. after birth, apoptosis plays additional roles in tissue homeostasis, immune selection and in deleting cells that have become infected, irreparably damaged, or transformed  <cit> . the apoptotic cascade may be triggered through two major pathways. extracellular signals such as the tumour necrosis factor  family of proteins can activate the receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway. alternatively, stress signals such as dna damage or withdrawal of survival signals may trigger the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. regardless of the mechanism of activation, cells undergoing apoptosis show characteristic features, which include chromatin aggregation, nuclear/cytoplasmic condensation and partitioning of the cytoplasm and nucleus into membrane bound-vesicles , which contain ribosomes, morphologically intact mitochondria and nuclear material  <cit> .

numerous studies have focused on the identification of proteins and pathways that control apoptosis. apart from the specific interest in understanding how and which proteins regulate the balance between cell survival and cell death, there is considerable interest in regulating or harnessing their activity to modulate disease processes. in the current study, we have employed cell-based microarray technology to screen for genes that are pro-apoptotic when over-expressed. we have then characterised the activity of a number of the genes identified by following the transcriptional response of cell cultures undergoing increased levels of apoptosis due to their over-expression.

in summary, this study has employed a novel approach to the construction of large-scale cell-based microarrays which has been used to screen for proteins that induce apoptosis when over-expressed. using these arrays we have been able to identify a number of proteins that induce apoptosis, some of which are novel in this respect. through these studies we have been able to identify common apoptotic pathways on which the different pro-apoptotic proteins appear to be acting.

RESULTS
microarrays were constructed using plasmid dna from  <dig>  human mgc clones in the pcmv-sport <dig> vector. all plasmids were printed in quadruplicate within grids  except gfp, which was printed in columns to demarcate the grids and to act as a control for transfection. seven genes in the gateway pcdna-dest <dig> c-terminal gfp fusion vector for which we have previously characterised sub-cellular localisations  <cit>  were also included as transfection controls. the arrays were incubated with hek293t cells for approximately  <dig> hours, after which time clear grids of the transfection control pegfp-c <dig> could be observed . four separate arrays on two separate occasions were subjected to the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dutp nick end label  assay, which allows the detection of free 3'-oh termini present in the fragmented dna of apoptotic cells . replication of assays was found to be crucial for stringent screening as the ability to obtain a result for an individual gene was often compromised by imperfections in the cell monolayer, either as a result of differences in cell growth or post-culture treatment of the slides. a protein was scored as positive for apoptosis if one tunel-positive cell was observed by eye over one or more of the four replicate spots. this was a deliberately low threshold for a positive readout. the small number of cells over each spot , and the fact that apoptotic cells could be cleared in the late stages of apoptosis meant that the signal for even a strong pro-apoptotic gene was potentially weak.  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes  represented on the array were scored positive in two of the four replicate assays and were therefore considered to be potentially pro-apoptotic.

the  <dig> genes were then scrutinised further by examining their activity when transfected in 6-well plates. the results from the 6-well experiment indicated that out of the  <dig> positives from the array,  <dig>  showed no higher rates of cell death in cultures following transfection than the controls, with  <dig>  being true positives. the function, go descriptions and localisations were obtained for the  <dig> pro-apoptotic proteins identified by this study . some of these are known to be involved in apoptotic pathways, while others are uncharacterised in this respect .

gene ontology  categorisation lists  <dig> genes on the array under the apoptosis category. only one of these genes  was observed in the final list of ten positive genes. assuming that all  <dig> of the go categorised genes are capable of inducing apoptosis when over-expressed, the false negative rate of the array based assay can be estimated as 91%. from these numbers the sensitivity could be estimated as 60%, with an assay specificity measured by the positive predictive value of  <dig> % .

to determine the dynamics of apoptosis induction brought about by the over-expression of the  <dig> pro-apoptotic proteins, all were analysed in plate-based assays, using both the tunel and cleaved-casp <dig> assays at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours following transfection. a mock transfection and a well-characterised inducer of apoptosis, staurosporine  were assayed in parallel at each time point, as negative and positive controls respectively. higher levels of apoptosis were observed in cell cultures over-expressing each of the  <dig> proteins and the positive  control relative to the negative control, with levels of apoptosis rising at later time points .

three of the  <dig> proteins, aco <dig>  stk <dig> and xbp <dig> were chosen for further characterisation, by expression profiling of cell cultures over-expressing the genes. following transfection,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hour time points were chosen from the time-course study in order to cover early, mid and late gene transcriptional events associated with apoptosis progression (). rna samples were labelled and hybridised to the affymetrix hg-u <dig> genechip and the data was normalised using both the genechip operating system  and robust multivariate analysis . all raw and normalised data has been submitted to arrayexpress  <cit>  . the data was of high quality with the chips showing little variation in the quality control parameters recorded in the gcos report file. box plots also showed data distributions to be relatively similar across all chips . non-supervised clustering of the data using the conditions tree function within genespring  suggested that there was little or no treatment or time-specific clustering of the data . aco <dig>  stk <dig> and xbp <dig> appeared to be constitutively expressed within the cells as assessed by the gcos software, with these genes being reported as being present  in all the samples at all the time points . xbp <dig> appeared to have the highest constitutive expression i.e. gave the greatest signal, followed by aco <dig>  then stk <dig>  the signal intensities for all three transcripts  increased up to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively, within cells where the genes were over-expressed compared with the average expression level in cell cultures in which the genes had not been transfected. mock transfected and sts treated cells showed no rise in any of the three gene transcripts above constitutive levels. despite apparent differences in the baseline level of expression of the three gene transcripts, all genes showed similar expression levels  following transfection . these three genes exhibited the most significant fold changes in their expression following transfection relative to any of the genes represented on the affymetrix array.

data normalised using the rma method, was then used to prepare a list of differentially expressed genes. anova analysis was used to compare replicate data from each of the four test conditions  at each time point with the appropriate negative  control data. overall,  <dig>  gene transcripts were observed to be significantly differentially expressed in at least one of the  <dig> pair-wise comparisons. to refine the list of differentially expressed transcripts and minimise the false discovery rate, only transcripts that showed a fold change greater than  <dig>  and appeared in three or more of the  <dig> individual pair-wise comparisons were analysed further. this 'differentials list'  contained  <dig> transcripts. based on this list, venn diagrams were prepared from the individual comparisons such that the overlap in genes either differentially under or over-expressed across time-points could be assessed . overall, there was considerable overlap in the genes found to be differentially expressed across time-points, but there also appeared to be many that were specific to individual time points. of all the transcripts found to be differentially expressed following transfection, an average of  <dig> % across all time points and transfections were observed to decrease in expression. however, the overall number of gene transcripts that increased and decreased in expression was similar following treatment with sts. there were more transcripts in the xbp <dig> differentials lists than with other treatments and there were no obvious time point-specific trends in the number of gene transcripts increasing or decreasing in expression across the conditions. supervised clustering of the  <dig> transcripts present in three or more of the individual comparisons was used to assess the behaviour of these genes across the four experimental conditions. this revealed a surprising uniformity in the behaviour of genes across different time points and treatments . whilst individual genes showed some variation across the data set, genes that were up or down regulated in one comparison tended to show the same behaviour across all comparisons, although this change didn't always reach the level of statistical significance.

in an effort to associate the genes found to be differentially expressed in this experiment with apoptosis, we utilised the university of michigan list of apoptosis regulators  <cit> . this resource was used as it listed a large number of genes that according to the literature are potentially involved in apoptotic pathways. of the  <dig>  apoptosis regulators listed on this site,  <dig> were present in the differentials list generated by this experiment. this 'apoptosis differentials list' was therefore a list of differentially expressed genes that have been previously associated with apoptosis . the apoptosis differentials list contained genes that belonged to the same family and there were also genes that had known interaction partners .

in an effort to piece this information together, proteins within the apoptosis differentials list were marked red if they are thought to be pro-apoptotic and green if they appeared to increase the likelihood of cell survival based on the literature . if genes could be categorised in this way, we endeavoured to place them on a simplified kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  apoptosis pathway to give an indication of their likely site of activity within the apoptotic pathway.

discussion
the aim of this study was to adopt a functional genomics approach to screen for human genes that induce apoptosis when over-expressed. in order to do this, our strategy required the construction of a microarray of a large number of human genes in mammalian expression vectors. in a previous study, gfp-tagged genes in gateway expression vectors were used to examine the sub-cellular localisation of proteins over-expressed by reverse transfection  <cit> . in common with other studies, we found that gene-tagging can disrupt the normal sub-cellular localisation and therefore presumably the function of the protein. in addition, sub-cloning of the gene inserts has the potential to introduce errors in the orf during vector construction and inserting large numbers of genes into gateway constructs is both costly and time consuming. therefore, for the present study we decided to adopt a new approach to the construction of a high-content microarray of human genes by direct use of the readily available full-length mgc clones  <cit> . this strategy was possible as many of the mgc clones were already in the pcmv-sport <dig> vector, which contains a cmv promoter to drive expression of the orf in mammalian cells. plasmid preparations were attempted for  <dig>  mgc clones but we found that many did not yield enough/any product, despite repeated attempts. however, more than  <dig> μg plasmid dna was recovered from  <dig>  clones. in order to maximise the likelihood of observing the effects of over-expression on the cells covering arrays without compromising the array content, each of the  <dig>  purified mgc clones was printed in quadruplicate onto a glass slide to form the array. after inclusion of control features, the array possessed  <dig>  features in total. as such, this represents the largest over-expression cell-based reverse transfection microarray published to date.

following growth of hek293t cells over the array, the tunel assay was used to detect genes which had induced cell death when over-expressed. the assay was repeated on four separate arrays. when proteins only positive in two or more of the four assays were taken into account,  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes  appeared to be potentially inducing cell death. for verification, these  <dig> genes were then transfected in 6-well plates. the results from the 6-well plate assay indicated that out of the  <dig> positives from the array,  <dig>  were true positives . this would indicate that the arrays gave a fairly high false positive rate. calculation of the false negative rate presents more of a challenge. however, in an attempt to evaluate this we determined the number of genes on the array that have been linked with apoptosis by gene ontology  categorisation. eleven genes on the array were listed under the apoptosis category, but only one of these genes  was observed in the final list of  <dig> positive genes. assuming that all of these genes are capable of inducing apoptosis when over-expressed, the false negative rate of the array based assay was estimated as 91%. whether all  <dig> genes are truly capable of inducing apoptosis if over-expressed and whether they would do so in all cell types is uncertain. the high false positive and estimated false negative rates of this assay are attributable to a number of factors. in order to maintain the positional address of the positive signals relative to the marker gene  transfections during manual inspection of the arrays, it was necessary to view the array at a relatively low magnification . at this resolution the relatively weak signal produced by tunel assay may have been overlooked or background signal attributed incorrectly. employing automated high resolution scanning and image analysis tools would not only make scoring of cell-based arrays a lot easier, but would also improve the accuracy of scoring. the necessity for spot recognition software and the storage and analysis of the images present a considerable challenge. these issues are currently being explored and a microscope-based screening platform is being developed with automated sample preparation, image acquisition and data analysis  <cit> . improved tools for automated image analysis of cell-based arrays are also being developed elsewhere  <cit> .

of the  <dig> proteins found by this study to induce apoptosis when over-expressed a number have been linked previously with apoptosis, others have not. stk <dig> is known to be involved in fas-mediated apoptosis and is cleaved/activated by casp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it is possible to hypothesise mechanisms of action of four of the other proteins identified. xbp <dig> binds to the x-box of the hla-dr-alpha promoter   <cit>  and responds to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er  <cit> . it is possible that this change may trigger apoptosis, although this has not been demonstrated previously. there is other evidence that xbp <dig> may be linked to apoptosis. in an expression profiling study of murine mammary epithelial cells expressing conditionally active stat <dig> , xbp <dig> was highly up-regulated following stat <dig> activation  <cit> . cstb maintains appropriate equilibrium between free cysteine proteases and their complexes  <cit> . cathepsins can be inhibited by cstb and therefore this could prevent degradation of peptides and proteins, which in turn could possibly act as a pro-apoptotic stimulus. aco <dig> represses ferritin and increases tfr translation  <cit> , and its over-expression is therefore likely to cause a build up of free-iron within the cell. previous studies have shown that increased levels of intracellular free-iron can induce apoptosis  <cit> . exoc <dig> is a component of the exocyst complex involved in the docking of exocystic vesicles with fusion sites on the plasma membrane  <cit>  and potentially excessive removal of internal cell contents may cause apoptosis to occur. mllt <dig> and ccbp <dig> are both found in tumours, but no other information is available to allow speculation on a possible mode of action for their induction of apoptosis. the same is true of the relatively uncharacterised genes c22orf <dig>  mgc <dig> and loc <dig> 

from even the limited number of 'pro-apoptotic' genes identified by this study, it would appear that they could be further classified into two categories; those that are 'true' apoptotic modulators, the proteins they encode being directly involved with the cell's apoptotic/survival machinery; and those that act indirectly, their over-expression leading to cytotoxic changes within the cell which then triggers a pro-apoptotic response. it is inevitable that screens such as this will expose genes in both categories and further work is necessary to determine their exact mode of action. whilst 'true' apoptotic modulators might be considered more interesting in the pursuit of improved understanding of the apoptotic cascade, genes that give rise to apoptosis by indirect mechanisms may still have interest as novel therapeutic agents, for example in cancer gene therapy.

in an attempt to ascertain the timing and strength of apoptosis, a time course transfection study using hek293t cells was undertaken on all  <dig> genes, a positive control sts and a mock transfected negative control at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours following transfection. staurosporine  was used as the positive control as it is an apoptotic effector classically linked to caspase activation  <cit> . as the tunel assay has been shown to potentially detect necrotic death in addition to apoptotic death  <cit> , a cleaved casp <dig> assay was performed on the cultures in addition to the tunel assay. sts and all  <dig> genes identified by the reverse transfection screen led to cultures in 6-well plates exhibiting between 40–70% tunel and cleaved casp <dig> positive cells after  <dig> hours compared with only 3–4% in the mock transfection cultures.

apoptosis has been studied extensively and core pathways and events are generally well established. the regulation of apoptotic cell death is a complex interplay between proteins that promote cell survival and those that promote cell death. it is widely thought that the processes that control the balance between the life and death of a cell are regulated exclusively at the post-transcriptional level. as a result few observations have been made of the transcriptome during this process, although those that have  <cit>  suggested that this would be a useful approach to further characterise the action of these genes.

stk <dig>  aco <dig> and xbp <dig> were selected over the other seven genes for expression profiling studies  as the proteins they encode had either been shown in previous studies to induce or be connected to apoptosis  or a clear apoptotic hypothesis could be postulated . for the expression profiling study, samples were taken at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours following transfection to observe the early, mid and late transcriptional events associated with apoptosis. aco <dig>  stk <dig> and xbp <dig> were all found to be constitutively expressed within the cells but at different levels. it was interesting to note that despite differences in constitutive expression, all genes appeared to reach a similar level of up-regulation following transfection and that the changes in expression observed for these transcripts were the largest of all the transcripts represented on the expression profiling array.

it was envisaged that expression profiling experiments might reveal a transcriptional response in these cultures that would provide clues as to the mechanism by which the over-expression of these genes induces apoptosis. overall, analysis of the microarray expression data indicated that the changes observed at all time points and across all conditions were relatively subtle. there was no strong tendency for the data to cluster according to treatment or time-point . the lists of differentially expressed transcripts of genes prepared by comparing each time point with its respective mock transfection control, showed many genes to be significantly changing their expression, but on the whole these changes were relatively small i.e. the majority of changes were less than 2-fold in magnitude. for each transfection experiment, many more transcripts were down-regulated in expression than up-regulated during apoptosis progression. a similar observation was also reported in a previous study of the transcriptional events associated with apoptosis following removal of cell survival factors from cultures of huvec cells  <cit> . however, with sts treatment the number of gene transcripts that were significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in expression overall was similar. what this indicates with respect to the fundamental mode of action for sts in apoptosis induction as opposed to the gene over-expression is uncertain. the number of transcripts identified as significantly changing with each treatment and at each time point varied considerably. in order to compare the condition or time-specific changes in transcript expression between the genes, a gene tree was plotted of the  <dig> transcripts that had changed in expression more than  <dig> -fold and that were present in  <dig> or more of the  <dig> pair-wise treatment comparisons . there was a surprising degree of uniformity in behaviour of these genes across all conditions and time points. genes that were up- or down-regulated in one comparison tended to show the same behaviour across all comparisons, although this change did not always reach the level of statistical significance. indeed, we were unable to find any convincing condition-specific changes in transcriptome activity that might give clues as to the mechanism by which functionally distinct genes induce apoptosis when over-expressed. whether this is because the events leading to the initiation of a pro-apoptotic response occurred post-transcriptionally or that the changes are too subtle to be recognised is unclear. rather, these findings strongly indicate that the majority of the changes we observed were associated with a universal pattern of gene regulation during apoptosis, regardless of the initiating trigger.

in order to further explore the apoptotic signatures in this data, the university of michigan list of apoptosis regulators  <cit>  was used to identify other potentially interesting apoptosis-associated genes in the list of differentials.  <dig> genes were shared between this list and the list of genes found here to be differentially expressed. many gene family members and known interactors that have been previously associated with either the pro-apoptotic or cell survival machinery were present within this new list of  <dig> apoptosis-associated genes. . a literature search was performed on the  <dig> genes in the list to ascertain their function. some apoptosis associated genes e.g. nr4a <dig>  egr <dig> slit <dig>  casp <dig>  adm, smad <dig>  jun and timp <dig> significantly changed in their expression in every transfection/treatment compared to the negative control; others were only observed to change under certain conditions. in order to provide a simplified view of this data, these genes were mapped onto a modified version of the kegg apoptosis pathway if they were present in at least three of the four experimental conditions. their action in either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of apoptosis and their directional change in expression is indicated . overall, this approach supported the hypothesis that the transfected genes and sts were ultimately acting through similar pathways to induce cell death. in each case, numerous genes were observed to change which were associated with the mapk8/casp <dig> pathway and in addition there were clear indications of suppression of the cell survival pathways. whilst the kegg pathway was helpful in visualising the apoptotic pathways, many of the genes on the university of michigan list of apoptosis regulators  <cit>  had to be added onto the pathway. in addition, there are most likely other genes in the lists of differentials that will be influencing the progression of apoptosis, but have not yet been recognised as being involved with the regulation of cell death.

overall, the expression profiling studies have provided valuable insights into the transcription changes associated with apoptosis, as the transcriptional changes associated with programmed cell death have not been studied extensively. this current study supports the notion that there are discrete changes in the mrna abundance of certain genes during apoptosis  <cit> . as many of these transcripts encode proteins that are known regulators of cell survival and death, it would seem likely that transcriptional regulation of these mediators contributes to a cell's final decision to undergo a programmed cell death.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the design and use of the first truly large-scale cell-based microarray for studies using the approach described first by ziauddin and sabatini  <cit> . it has demonstrated the potential as well as the current limitations of this technology to screen large numbers of genes for those that induce a functional change in cellular physiology when over-expressed. we have identified  <dig> genes by this methodology that can induce apoptosis when transfected into hek <dig> cells, some of which have been previously associated with apoptosis and others which have not. in order to examine the functional activity of these genes, a time course expression profiling experiment was set up to follow the transcriptional changes associated with apoptosis induction for three of the genes. this revealed that apoptosis induction is associated with discrete changes in a cell's transcriptome and that many of these changes seem identical regardless of mechanism by which apoptosis has been induced. furthermore, many of the genes observed to change in their expression level during cell death have previously been associated with apoptosis and in this study strongly indicate the activation of the mapk8/casp <dig> and bcl <dig> pathways.
