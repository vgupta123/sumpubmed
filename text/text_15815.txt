BACKGROUND
bacteria commonly known as rhizobia are capable of establishing symbioses with several leguminous species, forming specific structures, the root nodules, where the process of biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen takes place, bringing important contributions to agriculture and to the environment  <cit> . legume nodulation requires a cascade of molecular signals exchanged between the host plant and the rhizobium. this molecular dialogue begins with the exudation of flavonoids from the legume, which are recognized by the bacterium. when induced by these plant molecules, rhizobia synthesize lipochitooligosaccharides , also known as nod factors, responsible for launching the nodulation process  <cit> . it is noteworthy that an increasing number of reports show that nod factors may play roles beyond the nodulation process, including stimulation of photosynthesis, improvements in plant growth and grain yield and changes in immune responses in both legumes and non-legumes  <cit> .

we consider nodd as the most intriguing regulatory nodulation gene; it belongs to the lysr family of transcriptor regulators, and it is constitutively expressed and responsible for the transcription of other nodulation genes in the presence of suitable plant inducers, usually flavonoids, thus initiating the nodulation process  <cit> . furthermore, many other symbiosis-related phenotypes, such as polysaccharide production, phytohormone synthesis, motility, quorum-sensing and the activation of the type-iii secretion system are directly or indirectly regulated by means of inducing flavonoids via nodd in rhizobia  <cit> . studies of genomes of rhizobia indicate that, depending on the rhizobial species, there are one to five copies of nodd. in the species that possess only one copy of this gene, such as rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, a mutation usually results in loss of nodulation, whereas, in the presence of multiple copies, as in sinorhizobium  meliloti, rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli and bradyrhizobium japonicum, an intricate interaction between the nodd genes seems to occur and the nodulation is not completely suppressed  <cit> .

rhizobiun tropici strain ciat  <dig> is an effective microsymbiont of common bean  in the tropical acid soils of south america. notable properties of this strain are its high tolerance of environmental stresses and its broad legume host-range  <cit> . another intriguing feature of ciat  <dig> is its capacity for producing a large variety of nod factors  <cit> . interestingly, this bacterium is able to produce these key symbiotic molecules under abiotic stresses, such as acid and saline conditions, in the absence of plant-molecular signals  <cit> . in a pioneering study, five distinct nodd-hybridizing dna regions were identified in ciat  <dig>  <cit> , later confirmed as five nodd genes in the sequenced genome of the strain  <cit> . the nodd <dig> gene preceding the nodabc operon seems to play the major role in nodulation  <cit> , but a more precise study of the regulatory functions of nodd <dig> in r. tropici is lacking. in addition, the role of nodd <dig>  present in some rhizobial species, is unclear. it has been reported to be a repressor of the nodabc operon, leading to a negative effect on nod-factor production in sinorhizobium  fredii strain ngr  <dig>  <cit> . a suppressive role has also been observed in b. japonicum  <cit>  and a negative regulation by nodd <dig> products was reported in bradyrhizobium   <cit> .

here we report a study in which phenotypes, nod factors and gene expression of mutants of nodulation genes nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> of strain ciat  <dig> were compared with those of the wild type strain, to help to elucidate the roles of these regulatory genes.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of wild type and mutant strains
as defined in the genome of r. tropici strain ciat  <dig>  <cit> , nodd <dig> precedes the nodabc operon, while nodd <dig>  corresponding to nodd <dig> described by van rhijn et al.  <cit> , is adjacent to the noda <dig> and hsnt genes . r. tropici ciat  <dig> nodd <dig> mutant was obtained in a previous work by insertion of a kmr cassette into a unique xhoi restriction site located on the gene  <cit> . as described in the material and methods section, the nodd <dig> mutant was obtained after deletion of a  <dig>  kb psti fragment of the gene and the insertion in its place of the Ω interposon .

growth rate was not affected by mutation in nodd <dig> or nodd <dig> genes of r. tropici ciat  <dig> . however, it is known that some bacterial properties may be regulated via nodd proteins, such as eps  production, lps  profiles, swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation and iaa  synthesis, among others . we evaluated some these properties in the wild type and mutant strains in the presence or absence of two nod-gene inducing molecules, apigenin  and salt . results showed statistical differences only in swarming motility  and in the production of iaa .figure  <dig>

swarming motility is caused by rotation of single or multiple flagellae along wetted surfaces  <cit>  and, in certain rhizobia, is altered in the presence of legume root exudates that are rich in flavonoids  <cit> . our experiments showed that, under control conditions, both nodd mutants showed more swarming motility than did the wild type strain. interestingly, these differences were even stronger when the medium was augmented with apigenin for the nodd <dig> mutant and with nacl for the nodd <dig> mutant . therefore, the results suggest a constitutive suppression of swarming by nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> proteins.

iaa is an essential plant hormone that promotes growth, including lateral-root proliferation. previous work has demonstrated that synthesis of this molecule is regulated by nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> in s. fredii strain ngr <dig>  <cit> . in ciat  <dig>  our experiments showed an increase in the production of iaa in the presence of apigenin and nacl , suggesting that both inducing molecules promote the synthesis of this phytohormone. this finding is supported by the presence of a nod-box upstream of the iaa operon in the genome of ciat  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, nodd <dig> seems to be the main regulator in the presence of apigenin, since, in this mutant, the production of iaa was significantly lower than in the presence of nacl. the production of iaa in the nodd <dig> mutant was strongly reduced when the medium was supplemented with nacl , suggesting that this regulator may be mainly implied in the activation of the iaa operon in the presence of salt. altogether, the results indicate a predominant role of nodd <dig> in activation of the iaa gene by apigenin and a predominant role of nodd <dig> when the inducing molecule is nacl.

the nodulation phenotype in common bean was first evaluated in pouches bags, where it was possible to observe that a mutation in nodd <dig> caused a significant decrease in nodule number of common bean; to a lesser extent, a decrease was also observed with a mutation in nodd <dig> . in both leucaena  and siratro , no nodules were observed when plants were inoculated with the nodd <dig> mutant, but apparently no differences were observed when plants of both species were inoculated with the nodd <dig> mutant in comparison with plants inoculated with the wild type strain .

nodulation of the type and mutants was confirmed by growing plants in larger pots, in leonard jars containing sterile substrate. in common bean, a mutation in nodd <dig> did not suppress nodulation, but caused a reduction of 82% in nodule number . the absence of nodulation in both leucaena and siratro when inoculated with the nodd <dig> mutant was confirmed. vis-à-vis the nodd <dig> mutant, nodulation of common bean was reduced by 55%, and no statistical differences in relation to the wild type strain were observed in the nodulation of either leucaena or siratro. however, shoot dry weight of the leucaena plants inoculated with the nodd <dig> mutant was lower than with the wild type  .table  <dig>

in rhizobial species with more than one copy of the regulatory nodd gene, nodd <dig> preceding the nodabc operon has been recognized as the main gene regulating nodulation e.g.  <cit> . however, reports show that the role of each nodd copy, their responses to flavonoids, and the nodulation phenotypes vary on a case-by-case basis with the rhizobium strain and the host-plant species/cultivar. an intricate pattern of responses in nodulation leads to the assumption that s. meliloti utilizes the three copies of nodd to optimize the interaction with each of its legume hosts  <cit> . a mutation in nodd <dig> of s. meliloti delays but does not eliminate nodulation of both alfalfa  and sweet clover , and only a triple mutation of nodd1-nodd2-nodd <dig> results in absence of nodules  <cit> . contrarily, in the promiscuous strain s. fredii ngr  <dig>  capable of nodulating more than  <dig> plant species, a mutation in nodd <dig> abolishes nodulation in several temperate and tropical species  <cit> . in addition, in b. japonicum nodd <dig> is sufficient for nodulation of the putative main host plant, soybean , but the additional genes nodvw are required for the nodulation of mung bean , cowpea  and siratro  <cit> . in our study, a mutation in nodd <dig> decreased, but did not suppress, nodulation of common bean; however, nodd <dig> proved to be essential for the nodulation both of leucaena and of siratro .

still considering nodulation phenotype, in s. meliloti the nodd <dig> gene did not have any apparent effect on nodulation of either alfalfa or sweet clover  <cit> . similarly, no detectable effects were observed by inoculating siratro and cowpea with a nodd <dig> mutant of bradyrhizobium  sp. strain nc <dig>  <cit> . contrarily, in our study, a significant decrease in nodulation of common bean was detected with the mutation in nodd <dig>  but no effects were observed in leucaena and siratro .

nod factor patterns
rhizobium tropici strain ciat  <dig> is known as an interesting strain in relation to its production of a large variety of nod factors, not only when induced by flavonoids  <cit> , but also under high-salinity conditions in the absence of flavonoids  <cit> .

a list of all nod factors detected in the wild type strain in comparison to the nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants is shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  unexpectedly, nod factors were found in the b− medium  <cit> , even in the absence of inducer molecules. in this condition, around ten nod factors were synthesized, with no significant differences among wild type ciat  <dig>  nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants . when induced by  <dig>  μm apigenin, the synthesis of a variety of nod factors was confirmed in all strains, such that numerically,  <dig> nod factors were detected in the wild type ciat  <dig> and  <dig> in the nodd <dig> mutant; a slight reduction was observed with the nodd <dig> mutant, but, even then,  <dig> nod factors were observed . this number is higher than in other wild type rhizobial species, e.g.the four nod factors identified in b. japonicum strain usda  <dig>  <cit> . up to  <dig> nod factors were found in ciat  <dig> under saline conditions , and in the nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants the numbers were lower, of  <dig> and  <dig> nod factors, respectively. these results indicate that nacl has a stronger nod-induction capacity than apigenin does, and that it is affected by nodd <dig> but not nodd <dig>  however, one might also consider that it deserves further studies to investigate the possibility that nod factors are more stable in a 300 mm nacl supplemented medium.table  <dig>

the production of a large number of nod factors in all conditions tested might be related to broad host promiscuity and abiotic-stress tolerance of r. tropici  <cit> . the promiscuous s. fredii strain ngr  <dig> also produces a larger number of nod factors   <cit> , and the composition of nod factors produced by this strain varies with the activity of host-specific nodulation genes  <cit> . furthermore, one interesting feature observed in our study was that the nod factors with structure iii , iv , iv , v  and v  were present in the wild type and in the nodd <dig> mutant, but not in the nodd <dig> mutant; therefore, this structure might be implicated in host-specific nodulation, and could explain why the mutant in the nodd <dig> gene is unable to induce nodules on leucaena or siratro. it is also worth mentioning that folch-mallol et al.  <cit>  described that in ciat  <dig> the sulfation of the lcos, mediated by the nodhpq genes are important for nodulation efficiency on l. leucocephala. a mutant in the nodh gene induced about half of nodules than those induced by the wild type strain  <cit> . interestingly, one of the five lcos not synthesized by the ciat  <dig> nodd <dig> mutant is sulphated   and may be important for nodulation on leucaena. however, because the nodd <dig> mutant is unable to nodulate leucaena, other lcos not secreted by this mutant must be important to explain its symbiotic phenotype.

in r. tropici, the amount and diversity of nod factors produced are directly influenced by the conditions of bacterial growth. our results are consistent with the report that ciat  <dig> produces of a high number of nod factors in the presence of nod-gene-inducing molecules  <cit> , which provides a better understanding of the control of nod-factor biosynthesis, and which, in r. tropici, does not follow the classical pathway mediated by flavonoids.

gene expression
in various strains of rhizobia, the nodd <dig> gene is the chief regulator of nod-factor biosynthesis and symbiotic phenotype e.g.  <cit> . contrarily, nodd <dig> has been proposed as a repressor of nod-gene expression  <cit> , affecting the bacterial nod-factor profile. we performed gene expression studies with the wild type and nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants, to improve our understanding of the roles of these two genes .figure  <dig>

we evaluated the relative expression of the nodc gene , which controls the elongation of the oligosaccharide chain of nod factors and is transcribed with the activation of nod genes. the relative expression of nodc was lower for both mutants in comparison to the wild type strain, both in the apigenin and in the salt treatments .

significant expressions of the nodd <dig> gene was observed in the wt strain both with salt and apigenin, while for the nodd <dig> mutant it was statistically significant only when induced with apigenin, and higher than in the wt .

in relation to the expression of nodd <dig>  ciat  <dig> wt strain significantly expressed the gene both with salt and apigenin. contrarily, no statistically significant expression was observed for the nodd <dig> mutant in none of the conditions evaluated . however, we must consider that the expression levels of nodd <dig> were all very low, and numerically even higher for the nodd <dig> mutant in the presence of apigenin, therefore no strong conclusion can be taken from this assay at this moment .

all together, these results indicate that the nodd <dig> is a positive regulator gene, while nodd <dig> may positively or negatively regulate the expression of the nodd <dig> gene. supporting these results is evidence of the involvement of nodd <dig> in the regulation of the expression of nodd <dig> by binding to nod box-like sequences located upstream of its coding region  <cit> .

proposal of a regulatory model for nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> genes of r. tropici
a graphic summary of the main features of the wild type ciat  <dig> and nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> mutants is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  in our study a major role of nodd <dig> in r. tropici ciat  <dig> was confirmed. in the presence of the nod-gene-inducer apigenin, nodd <dig> greatly increased the expression of nodc , decreasing to 15-fold when the gene was mutated. similar responses, but lower in magnitude, were observed under saline conditions . although confirming a major role of nodd <dig>  the results also indicate that other nodd genes are involved in the activation of nodc, in the presence both of flavonoids and of salts.

still in relation to nodd <dig>  a mutation abolished nodulation in leucaena and siratro, but not in common bean. as nodd <dig> gene is the chief regulator of nod-factor biosynthesis and thus nodulation of the host plant e.g.  <cit> , our results suggest that common bean might not be the main host of r. tropici, although it has been largely isolated from this host legume in acid soils of south america  <cit> . indeed, doubts about common bean as the main host of r. tropici have been raised, giving support to the hypothesis that the species might be an original symbiont of another indigenous legume, further “adapting” to common bean  <cit> . r. tropici has been isolated from common bean and other indigenous legumes in europe, africa, australia, and north america  <cit> , and results of some studies suggest the following as original host candidates for r. tropici: gliricidia spp., from which the strain has been isolated in mexico  <cit>  and brazil  <cit> ; acaciella angustissima in mexico  <cit> ; and mimosa spp. in brazil  <cit> .

understanding the relation between nod factors and host specificity has been a goal of several studies, but without full success. in our research, we found that nod factors of the following structures, iii , iv , iv ,v  and v   might be related—to a greater or lesser extent—to the nodulation of the original host plant, as they are absent in the nodd <dig> mutant. we have also confirmed the great variety of nod factors produced by r. tropici, as reported before  <cit> , even in the absence of nod-gene inducers  <cit>  . we propose a new, constitutive mechanism of nod-factor synthesis that is highly enhanced when environmental conditions are stressful, such as strongly acidic ph or salinity. some transcriptional regulators may be activated in these conditions and they could be responsible for the regulation of nod-gene expression via nodd regulators.

in various rhizobial strains, nodd <dig> has been described as a repressor of the expression of nod genes e.g.  <cit> . for example, in b. japonicum, induction of nodc by flavonoids is virtually suppressed by elevated levels of nodd <dig>  <cit> , and in s. fredii extra plasmid copies of nodd <dig> reduced the level of nodd <dig> transcripts to below the limits of detection  <cit> . however, there is still no evidence that the suppression by nodd <dig> is mediated by nodd <dig>  in our study, we found that nodd <dig> activated nodc at similar levels as those observed for nodd <dig> with both apigenin and salt. however, a slight repression of nodd <dig> by nodd <dig> was observed in the presence of apigenin . accordingly, we hypothesize that nodd <dig> is usually an activator of nod-gene transcription, although, in the presence of some flavonoids it may slightly repress nodd <dig>  nevertheless, if this repression is biologically significant, it remains to be determined, as no differences in nodulation were observed for leucaena or siratro in the absence of nodd <dig>  whereas nodulation was decreased in common bean.

our model contends that full nodulation of common bean by r. tropici requires both nodd <dig> and nodd <dig>  while, in other plant species that might represent the original host, nodd <dig> plays the major role. nodd <dig> is not a strong repressor as described in other rhizobial species, and, in general, plays a role as an activator of nod-gene transcription, but, in specific conditions, it may slightly repress nodd <dig>  the nodd regulation in r. tropici ciat  <dig> resembles the pattern observed in s. meliloti—need for three copies of nodd to optimize the interaction with each of its legume hosts  <cit> . the biological significance of producing an abundance of nod factors is not completely understood yet, but we hypothesize that represents an evolutionary strategy to avoid abiotic stresses by nodulating a range of legume species. reports show that nod genes may also control other functions that contribute to nodulation, as described for nodd <dig> in the exopolysaccharide synthesis of s. fredii  <cit> , and chaperones and other genes by nodd <dig> in s. meliloti  <cit> , inter alia. our results demonstrate extra roles for nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> of r. tropici in swarming motility and iaa synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our model proposes that full nodulation of common bean by r. tropici requires both nodd <dig> and nodd <dig>  while in other plant species that might represent the original host nodd <dig> plays the major role. contrarily to other rhizobial species, nodd <dig> of r. tropici is usually not a strong repressor of nod-gene transcription. r. tropici synthesizes a variety of nod factors that might be related to the ability of nodulating a variety of legume species, representing an evolutionary strategy of the symbiosis under abiotic stressful conditions. nodd <dig> and nodd <dig> of r. tropici also play roles in swarming motility and iaa synthesis.
