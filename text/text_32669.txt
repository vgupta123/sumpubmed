BACKGROUND
fusarium ear blight  disease, also known as fusarium head scab disease, is a globally significant threat to the floral tissues of small grain cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize, caused by several species of ascomycete fungi of the genus fusarium. the main causal agents of feb in the uk are fusarium graminearum and f. culmorum . the disease can cause huge crop losses in epidemic years due to reduction in grain yield or grain quality and via the contamination of the grain with mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol  which make grain unsafe for human and animal consumption . no commercially available wheat cultivars are fully resistant to feb and the basis of resistance is complex and major quantitative trait loci  based .

both f. graminearum and f. culmorum infect the floral and silique tissue of arabidopsis thaliana under experimental conditions, thereby providing a tractable model for the study of host pathogen interactions during feb disease . a role for a number of arabidopsis genes in resistance/susceptibility to fusarium has been identified using this pathosystem . in addition, transgenic and chemical approaches have been used to alter arabidopsis leaf and floral susceptibility to feb causing fusarium species . these findings have the potential to improve defence against feb in cereal crops using conventional and transgenic approaches, and also enhance our understanding of defence responses in plant reproductive tissues.

the arabidopsis downy mildew resistant  mutants were isolated from a gain of function screen for resistance to the oomycete pathogen hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, following ethyl methanesulfonate  mutagenesis of plants of the susceptible genotype ler- <dig> harbouring the enhanced disease susceptibility mutation eds1- <dig> . the eds1- <dig> mutation in ler- <dig> has previously been shown not to alter the interaction outcome between f. culmorum and arabidopsis floral or silique tissue . of the five dmr mutant alleles identified, three  showed constitutive expression of the salicylic acid mediated defence related gene pr- <dig>  the remaining mutants, dmr <dig> and dmr <dig>  were mapped and identified as encoding mutations in the arabidopsis homoserine kinase, and a putative 2-oxoglurarate oxygenase, respectively . dmr <dig> is associated with salicylic acid mediated defence signalling but is required for h. arabidopsidis susceptibility. mutation of dmr <dig> results in accumulation of homoserine in non-inoculated plants, and exogenous application of l-homoserine co-incident with h. arabidopsidis inoculation confers resistance in wild type plants. however, the precise role of l-homoserine in resistance is not known.

we used the fusarium – arabidopsis floral pathosystem  to assess the effects of the dmr mutations on fusarium susceptibility in arabidopsis floral, silique and rosette leaf tissue. mutants dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr <dig> and dmr <dig>  were initially investigated; dmr <dig> and dmr <dig> have pleiotropic dwarf phenotypes which affect floral morphology and were therefore unsuitable for inclusion in this study. here we present the novel finding that reduced function of the arabidopsis homoserine kinase dmr <dig> confers resistance to f. graminearum and f. culmorum in siliques and/or reduces colonisation of rosette leaf tissues, with varying levels of resistance conferred by different dmr <dig> mutant alleles. the siliques of dmr <dig> plants accumulate homoserine but are not depleted in amino acids such as threonine and methionine which are downstream products of homoserine kinase activity. we also find that mutation of dmr <dig> results in delayed leaf senescence which may relate to the observed reduced leaf colonisation phenotype. exogenous application of l-homoserine reduces floral and silique disease severity in both eds1- <dig> and dmr <dig> plants, but does not inhibit in vitro fusarium growth.

RESULTS
a selection of the arabidopsis downy mildew resistant mutants have altered susceptibility to fusarium culmorum silique infection and rosette leaf colonisation
the arabidopsis mutants dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr <dig> and dmr <dig>  which were generated in the ler- <dig> eds1- <dig> background, were screened for altered susceptibility to f. culmorum infection compared to eds1- <dig>  wild type ler- <dig> was also included in the assay. following spray inoculation with f. culmorum spores, the plants were scored for floral and silique disease levels, along with rosette leaf infection and number of uninfected green siliques, after  <dig>   <dig> and 14 days . there was no statistically significant difference in floral fad  score  between the genotypes tested  at any of the time points assessed, with disease progressing at an equivalent rate in all genotypes . at the time of inoculation, this tissue had been unopened green buds.figure  <dig>

by contrast, there was a significant effect of genotype on silique fad score . the siliques assessed had been open flowers at the time of inoculation. the disease progression in the ler- <dig> and ler- <dig> eds1- <dig> plants was identical . the mutant allele dmr1- <dig> had significantly reduced silique disease levels at all time points compared to eds1- <dig> . this finding was confirmed in multiple independent experiments. genotypes dmr <dig> and dmr <dig> had reduced silique disease symptoms at  <dig> and 11 days post inoculation  in the displayed experiment but these findings were not consistent across experiments. the dmr1- <dig> plants had significantly higher numbers of uninfected green siliques than eds1- <dig> at all time points, whilst for dmr <dig> significantly more green siliques were observed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi but not at  <dig> dpi .

while healthy rosette leaf tissue is not susceptible to fusarium infection under our experimental conditions, colonisation by the fungus occurs during leaf senescence. colonisation of rosette leaves was formally assessed following the observation that dmr <dig> leaves support less fungal growth. the number of colonised rosette leaves following the initial spray inoculation was found to be significantly affected by genotype . both dmr <dig> alleles had significantly fewer colonised rosette leaves than eds1- <dig> at all time points . interestingly, ler- <dig> had significantly more colonised rosette leaves per plant than eds1- <dig>  indicating that the eds <dig> mutation may have an effect on f. culmorum leaf susceptibility that was not identified in the previous study which focused on floral infection .

mutation of dmr <dig> reduces susceptibility to f. graminearum
feb disease is caused by several cereal infecting fusaria species. therefore, the susceptibility to f. graminearum infection was compared between the dmr <dig> mutant alleles dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig>  and the parental genotype eds1- <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi . results were similar to those obtained for f. culmorum: no difference was observed in floral susceptibility . rosette leaf colonisation was affected by genotype  with both dmr <dig> alleles having fewer diseased rosette leaves than eds1- <dig> . silique fad scores and uninfected silique numbers also differed between genotypes . silique fad scores were lower in dmr1- <dig> than eds1- <dig> at all time points, with uninfected green siliques higher in dmr1- <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . in these f. graminearum inoculated experiments, full infected and very necrotic siliques were visible in the eds1- <dig> plants from  <dig> dpi onwards, whereas this extreme silique phenotype was rarely observed from  <dig> dpi onwards for either the dmr1- <dig> or the dmr1- <dig> plants. overall these results indicate that both leaf and silique resistance conferred by mutation of dmr <dig> is conserved across at least two cereal infecting fusarium species.figure  <dig>

multiple dmr <dig> alleles have increased resistance to f. culmorum
in order to verify that the silique resistance phenotype observed in dmr1- <dig> is a result of mutation of dmr <dig> and not caused by a second ems induced mutation, three additional alleles of dmr <dig>  were tested for altered resistance to f. culmorum . the dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> mutants all had lower silique disease levels than eds1- <dig>  , whilst no differences in floral susceptibility were observed between the various dmr <dig> genotypes and eds1- <dig>  this again indicates that the open flowers and very immature siliques at the time of inoculation of the dmr <dig> mutant plants were more resistant to f. culmorum infection than the green unopened buds. fungal growth on rosette leaves was also different between genotypes  with fewer rosette leaves per plant infected in genotypes dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> compared to eds1- <dig> . collectively, these results confirm that increased silique and leaf resistance occurs in multiple dmr <dig> alleles and is therefore likely a result of disruption of dmr <dig> function.figure  <dig>

plants harbouring the mutant alleles dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> were also assessed for altered susceptibility to f. culmorum using a second inoculation method, namely the spore droplet, single silique point inoculation assay. this assay involves initially removing 1 mm of tissue from the tip of each immature silique and then placing the 1μl spore droplet onto the cut surface. no clear differences were seen in the distance of visible disease progression through the silique and pedicel between genotypes .

homoserine accumulates in the siliques of dmr <dig> mutant plants
resistance of dmr <dig> leaves to h. arabidopsidis infection was previously linked to elevated homoserine levels in 10 day old seedlings . we analysed the amino acid composition of the siliques of three dmr <dig> mutant alleles compared to eds1- <dig> in order to identify whether homoserine also accumulates in dmr <dig> siliques . homoserine was not detectable in eds1- <dig> siliques, but was abundant in dmr <dig> siliques . homoserine levels were comparable between all three mutant alleles, but were higher on average in dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> siliques, which are resistant to f. culmorum, compared to dmr1- <dig> siliques, which have wild type resistance levels. as previously observed in seedling tissue by van damme and colleagues, mutation of homoserine kinase does not reduce levels of downstream amino acids . threonine levels were elevated in dmr1- <dig> siliques, while methionine was more abundant in dmr1- <dig> siliques. interestingly, these changed levels observed in siliques correlate well with the levels of these amino acids in young seedlings. glycine  was more abundant in all dmr <dig> siliques than in eds1- <dig>  an unidentified amino acid that is not a homoserine conjugate was also detected in dmr <dig> samples but absent from eds1- <dig> figure  <dig>

exogenous homoserine application reduces f. culmorum infection in arabidopsis buds and siliques
exogenous application of l-homoserine, but not d-homoserine, was previously shown to increase resistance in arabidopsis and tomato to the obligate biotrophs hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and oidium neolycopersici, respectively, but homoserine did not inhibit spore germination or in vitro growth of oomycete pathogens . we therefore investigated whether application of either enantiomer of homoserine affected growth of fusarium in vitro, or had the ability to mimic the dmr <dig> resistance phenotype in planta. we also investigated the effect of in planta threonine treatment on fusarium growth, since threonine is elevated in some dmr <dig> alleles and was previously shown to reduce h. arabidopsidis growth .

no strong inhibitory effect of either homoserine isoform on in vitro growth was found for f. culmorum or f. graminearum, following 48 h incubation in synthetic nutrient poor media supplemented with l- or d-homoserine at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 80 mm .

to assess the in planta effects of amino acid treatment on f. culmorum growth, plants were sprayed with either 10 mm l- or d- homoserine , l-threonine  or water, concurrent with spray inoculation with f. culmorum at early flowering. amino acid/water treatments were repeated daily for  <dig> dpi. significant differences in f. culmorum infection between treatments were found for unopened buds , open flowers , siliques  and rosette leaves . at  <dig> dpi, lhs treated buds showed little or no infection, and infection of opened flowers was also reduced, compared to dhs and water treated control plants . silique infection levels were slightly elevated in all amino acid treated plants compared to water controls in these experiments . threonine treatment increased f. culmorum colonisation in both open flowers and rosette leaves .figure  <dig>

plants treated with threonine also exhibited leaf chlorosis and lesion formation in the absence of f. culmorum infection, indicating that threonine spray treatment at and above 10 mm may induce a cell death response. this result was consistent in both eds1- <dig> and wild type ler- <dig> plants .

we also analysed the effect of d- and l-homoserine on f. culmorum infection of eds1- <dig> siliques following single silique wound point inoculations . siliques were droplet inoculated with water, dhs or lhs for 5 days following f. culmorum inoculation. there was a significant difference in f. culmorum infection development between treatments . dhs treatment resulted in a modest reduction in f. culmorum growth along inoculated siliques compared to water treatment, while lhs treatment resulted in significantly less fusarium growth than either water or dhs treatment, with most plants showing no externally visible infection. however, f. culmorum hyphae were present on and between seeds within some lhs treated siliques with externally uninfected pericarps .figure  <dig>

mutation of dmr <dig> affects plant growth and senescence
during the growth of the experimental plants, dmr1- <dig> plants appeared to be slightly smaller in size than eds1- <dig> plants. therefore, the rosette diameter and leaf number were measured and compared between 5-week old plants of genotypes dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig> and eds1- <dig>  the quantification of growth confirmed that the dmr1- <dig> plants have approximately ~25% smaller rosettes on average than eds1- <dig> , but that leaf number is similar between genotypes . this supports the recent findings by huibers et al.  <cit>  that some arabidopsis dmr <dig> mutants have reduced fresh weight compared to eds1- <dig>  leaf senescence between genotypes was also assessed by counting the number of visibly senescent leaves per plant at  <dig>   <dig>  and 14 days after flowering , and found to be delayed in both dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> compared to eds1- <dig> .

silique number were compared between genotypes at  <dig>   <dig> and 14 days post flowering  to ensure that the increased number of uninfected siliques observed in dmr1- <dig> was not due to more siliques being produced in this genotype. no difference was found between genotypes at any of the time points assessed . there was no evidence of increased silique number in the other dmr <dig> alleles investigated in this study, although this was not formally assessed.

exogenous application of l-homoserine only partially and inconsistently affected fusarium colonisation of wheat ears
the effect of exogenous homoserine application on fusarium infection in wheat spikes was assessed by treating f. graminearum infected wheat spikelets with l-homoserine, d-homoserine or sterile water daily for  <dig> dpi. fewer mean bleached spikelets and bent awns and higher grain number and weight were observed in l-homoserine treated plants compared to the other treatments in both experimental replicas. however, only the reduced number of bleached spikelets was statistically significant, and only in the first experimental replicate  .

discussion
in order to identify additional host genes controlling the outcome of the fusarium–arabidopsis interaction, as well as highlight components of defence signalling which are conserved in response to different pathogen types, we screened a number of downy mildew resistant mutants for altered susceptibility to the fungal pathogens f. culmorum and f. graminearum, which infect floral tissue in cereals and arabidopsis. we identified that multiple loss of function mutant alleles of the arabidopsis homoserine kinase gene dmr <dig> have increased resistance to fusarium culmorum: siliques of dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> were found to be more resistant to infection and leaves of dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig>  dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig>  supported reduced leaf colonisation. these phenotypes were also observed following f. graminearum infection of dmr1- <dig> and dmr1- <dig> 

these results indicate that there is potentially a common mechanism of susceptibility occurring in response to infection by both the downy mildew oomycete pathogen h. arabidopsidis, which is a leaf adapted obligate biotroph, and fungal hemi-biotrophic fusarium species which are floral adapted. mutation of atdmr <dig> and its tomato ortholog sldmr <dig> has also recently been shown to increase resistance to the obligate biotrophic fungal mildew oidium neolycopersici in an allele dependent manner, but has not been found to alter resistance to any other pathogens assessed, including the facultative biotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae . as with susceptibility to oidium neolycopersici , resistance to fusarium in dmr <dig> is allele dependent; while the dmr1- <dig> allele supports less rosette leaf colonisation and has delayed senescence it does not confer resistance in siliques, despite homoserine accumulating within this tissue. one hypothesis is that homoserine accumulation caused by the dmr <dig> mutation is not responsible for increased fusarium silique resistance, and that dmr <dig> has an additional function contributing to silique susceptibility which is not abolished in the dmr1- <dig> allele. meanwhile the delayed leaf senescence and associated reduction in fungal colonisation in this and the other alleles is due to reduced homoserine kinase function, and is therefore conserved between alleles. however, this does not account for the reduction in disease afforded by exogenous application of homoserine. an alternative hypothesis is that the dmr1- <dig> mutant harbours a second mutation as a result of the original ems mutagenesis which mitigates the silique resistance phenotype, either by blocking the activity of the elevated homoserine or independently elevating silique susceptibility via another pathway. the latter would potentially be less likely to affect saprophytic colonisation of senesced leaf tissue. further investigation is required to test these hypotheses.

mutation of dmr <dig> was not found to alter susceptibility to infection of unopened buds and young flowers, despite affecting both leaf and silique infection. analysis of arabidopsis dmr <dig> expression using genevestigator  shows that dmr <dig> is expressed at lower levels in some floral tissues than it is in vegetative tissue, namely in the stamens, anthers, stigma and sepals . since homoserine kinase activity has been shown to be driven by homoserine accumulation , it may be that these tissues do not produce high levels of homoserine and are therefore unaffected by decreased dmr <dig> activity. susceptibility of sepal and male reproductive tissue during early floral development pre-fertilisation may result in loss of the flower, whereas infection of these tissues post-pollination would have little effect on the siliques of resistant dmr <dig> plants, as this tissue is shed during silique development.

since dmr <dig> induced resistance to h. arabidopsidis is proposed to be mediated by homoserine accumulation and can be mimicked by exogenous l-homoserine application in wild type plants, we investigated the effects of homoserine application on fusarium growth in vitro and in planta. treatment of eds1- <dig> plants with l-homoserine  following spray inoculation with f. culmorum resulted in significantly decreased bud and flower colonisation by the fungus. this contrasts with the phenotype of dmr <dig> mutants, which have increased silique and leaf, but not floral, resistance. as previously discussed, the genevestigator analysis suggested that some floral organs may have lower hsk expression than other plant tissues . this may result in longer persistence of the applied homoserine in buds than in siliques and other tissues, resulting in reduced fungal growth compared to other tissues. this was corroborated by the finding that exogenous l-homoserine application onto resistant dmr1- <dig> siliques, which accumulate homoserine, further enhanced resistance to f. culmorum . we did find that more direct application of both the fungus and the lhs onto the tips of wounded siliques resulted in decreased fungal growth along the silique compared to water and dhs treated controls, indicating that homoserine treatment enhances resistance in wild type siliques under these infection conditions. however, in these experiments we also observed less f. culmorum infection following treatment with d-homoserine than with water, suggesting that the d-enantiomer of homoserine can also reduce fusarium growth in certain situations. this finding contrasts with the results obtained following spray inoculation, where both amino acid forms increase silique disease. the biological reason for this is unclear. formally, it is possible that daily application of distilled water to the silique tip might enhance the growth of fusarium, which requires high humidity for infection, whereas the various osmotic properties of the amino acid solutions do not. alternatively the d-homoserine may be eliciting a response from the wounded silique tip which then affects fungal growth. this demonstrates the importance of using the biologically inactive enantiomer as a control.

exogenous application of homoserine onto the spikelets of f. graminearum infected wheat cultivar apogee did not consistently reduce infection. the number of bleached spikelets was significantly lower in lhs treated plants  at 10 days post inoculation in one experimental replica, but there was no significant difference in the degree of awn bending, grain number or grain weight. therefore the effect of l-homoserine on fusarium infection and disease development was less pronounced on wheat floral tissue compared to arabidopsis. this interspecies difference is likely due to the rapid metabolism of the applied homoserine by the functional wheat homoserine kinase, preventing homoserine accumulation and activity. future research should therefore focus on disruption of wheat homoserine kinase function.

this study also presents the novel finding that exogenous application of threonine induces host cell death in arabidopsis leaves and increases f. culmorum colonisation. this raises further questions about the effects of amino acid metabolism on plant defence against different pathogen species and lifestyles. van damme and colleagues did not find an effect of exogenous threonine application on h. arabidopsidis susceptibility when amino acids were applied by vacuum infiltration. however, stuttmann et al.  <cit>  found that spray application of 1-5 mm threonine resulted in decreased h. arabidopsidis sporulation in ler- <dig> eds1- <dig> plants. these contrasting outcomes are interesting. h. arabidopsidis is a classic obligate biotroph and would therefore be sensitive to any host induced cell death which would limit this pathogen’s access to living tissue. by contrast fusarium has been shown to have a switching in planta lifestyle with host cell death an integral feature of the later disease formation process . cereal infecting fusaria are also able to colonise saprophytically dead plant tissue. threonine mediated chlorosis may therefore facilitate fusarium colonisation while preventing growth of obligate biotrophic pathogens.

related to this is the finding that mutation of dmr <dig> results in delayed senescence. analysis of dmr <dig> expression during plant development using genevestigator  shows that expression is fairly static throughout plant development but increases during senescence . this suggests that dmr <dig> function could have a role in programmed cell death and senescence. the delayed dmr <dig> dependent cell death in the dmr <dig> mutants may restrict fusarium disease progression and prevent its successful exploitation of host cell death . for pathogens such as fusarium with a combined hemi-biotrophic and saprophytic life style strategy, delayed cell death could prevent full tissue exploitation and the gaining of additional nutrition from the cellular debris. this is supported by the finding that dmr <dig> leaves display delayed senescence accompanied by a decrease in fusarium colonisation. however, the delayed cell death may not be the underlying cause of the enhanced resistance. for example, the manner in which delayed cell death might help protect plants against obligate biotrophic pathogens such as h. arabidopsidis is not clear. it is formally possible that the normal amino acid ratios found in healthy arabidopsis tissue are modified in the dmr <dig> mutants and this alters the efficiency of nutrient acquisition via the haustoria interfaces in obligate biotrophic interactions as well as altering the switching lifestyle of hemibiotrophic pathogens. in this regard, the identification of the novel accumulating amino acid in the three dmr mutants, but not eds1- <dig>  remains a priority.

huibers et al.  <cit>  found a correlation between reduced arabidopsis plant fresh weight in different dmr <dig> mutant alleles and the level of resistance conferred to o. neolycopersici. the authors concluded that it might be difficult to obtain dmr <dig> alleles in crop species which conferred enhanced resistance to this pathogen in the absence of a fitness cost. while the dmr1- <dig> mutant allele did not confer a significant growth penalty, likewise it did not confer resistance to o. neolycopersici. however, in the current study, dmr1- <dig> conferred resistance to f. culmorum in both the leaf and silique tissue of arabidopsis, although the leaf phenotype was not as strong as in other alleles. investigation into the effects of homoserine kinase disruption in feb-susceptible cereal crops is therefore warranted. this may be achieved both through stable transgenesis and the use of an inducible promoter to drive an rnai construct. alternatively, the use of transient virus induced gene silencing  of cereal homoserine kinases could be deployed.

in this study and that of van damme et al.  <cit>  it was found that dmr <dig> plants have wild type or elevated levels of the amino acids methionine, threonine and isoleucine, in both foliar and silique tissue . these amino acids are understood to be synthesised directly via the activity of homoserine kinase. the abundance of these three amino acids in plants with severely reduced homoserine kinase function therefore challenges the current understanding of amino acid biosynthetic pathways. it may be the case that these amino acids are being synthesised via alternative, currently unidentified pathway in the dmr <dig> mutants, which are independent of homoserine kinase. alternatively, mutated homoserine kinase may retain some residual function: homoserine is synthesised via the activity of arabidopsis aspartate kinases, which are negatively regulated by accumulation of s-adenosylmethionine , synthesised from methionine . reduced methionine biosynthesis may therefore result in increased aspartate kinase activity, shunting more homoserine into the pathway. some of the accumulating homoserine might then be phosphorylated by the mutated homoserine kinase, restoring equilibrium in the pathway. however, no changes were observed in aspartate levels between wild type and dmr <dig> mutant plants. experiments to compare aspartate kinase expression and activity between genotypes would be informative.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified that a series of mutations in the arabidopsis homoserine kinase gene dmr <dig> confers resistance in silique tissue to the primary causal agents of cereal feb disease, a source of crop yield losses and grain contamination. siliques of the dmr <dig> mutants accumulate homoserine, and exogenous application of l-homoserine confers resistance to the floral and silique tissues of both mutant dmr <dig> and wild type dmr <dig> plants. these finding offer the possibility of developing a novel source of resistance to an economically important floral crop disease for which few other resistance mechanisms exist. further work will use virus induced gene silencing of the wheat dmr <dig> ortholog to explore the potential of homoserine in fusarium resistance in wheat. however, the mechanism by which homoserine accumulation in plant tissue mediates resistance is still not fully understood, and may be key to fully exploiting dmr <dig> based resistance which has the potential for use in multiple crop species.
