BACKGROUND
while the existence of genetic compensation is widely accepted, the mechanism is largely unknown but important  <cit> . the proposed algorithm  was motivated by inferring transcriptional compensation  networks of sgs <dig>  and its synthetic sick or lethal  partners  <cit> . however, ssem can also be applied to infer other types of networks, such as transcriptional regulatory networks. following a gene's loss, the expression level of its compensatory gene increases , this phenomenon is called tc . paralogs or redundant genes are called digenic ssl gene pairs if the combination of two mutants, neither by itself lethal, causes the organism to die or malfunction  <cit> . ssl effects underlie many complex human diseases, such as type ii diabetes, schizophrenia, alzheimer's disease, and others  <cit> . since genetic networks derived from model organisms, such as yeast, are likely to be conserved in humans the prediction of tc and td may shed light on pathways that cause complex human diseases. with the abundant information produced by microarray technology, various approaches have been proposed to infer genetic networks or transcriptional regulatory networks. most of them may be classified into three classes, namely, graph models, discrete variable models and continuous variable models. due to space limits, we refer to  <cit>   for a thorough review of the models.

graph models  depict genetic interactions through directed graphs or digraphs instead of characterizing the interactions quantitatively. some graph models simply reveal structural information, others annotate the directions and signs of the regulations among genes. because of their simplicity, graph models usually require much less data than models in the other two categories. but they are inherently static and may not capture the dynamics of genetic regulations and the simultaneous regulation of a given gene by multiple genes. discrete variable models discretize gene expressions into a few states. the dynamics of gene expressions may be perceived as transitions of finite states. typical discrete variable models proposed are boolean networks, probabilistic boolean networks and discrete bayesian networks . continuous variable models characterize the expression of a gene or its change by a linear or non-linear continuous function of the expression of other genes. the genetic interactions are frequently modeled by a first-order or a second-order differential  equation. continuous variable models consist of two major types: continuous bayesian networks  <cit>  and deterministic differential systems  <cit> .

although each class of models has been shown to be informative for understanding genetic interactions, most of the models, except some bayesian networks, have the estimation bias problem due to model mis-specification. the model mis-specification arises from the fact that microarrays measure the mrna expressions only, while genetic interactions may be influenced by enzymes or proteins, for instance transcriptional factors. furthermore, most genetic networks reconstructed in previous studies considered only a subset of the whole genome. consequently, those genes that were left out may be regarded as latent factors influencing the genes of interest. thus, ignoring latent factors in the models may cause bias when inferring the genetic interactions. although a bayesian network can also incorporate latent factors  <cit> , the amount of data required may prevent it from being used.

to account for the latent factors effect using a reasonable amount of microarray data, a stepwise structural equation modeling algorithm  is proposed in this article. ssem is based on structural equation modeling   <cit> , which unifies factor analysis and path analysis. assuming linear relations among the observed and latent variables, the basic idea of sem is to minimize the discrepancy between the fitted covariance matrix and the sample covariance matrix. zhou et al.  <cit>  used shortest path analysis to identify transitive genes between two given genes in the same biological pathway. xie and bentler  <cit>  showed that the latent factors can be identified and their relations may be estimated reasonably by sem. note that without identifying the latent factors reasonably, the causal relations among genes can not be estimated correctly.

in this article, we extend the model in  <cit>  to simultaneously infer both latent factor-gene and gene-gene interactions. both  <cit>  and ssem extend the methodology of sem in the sense that the latent factors are formed from data and not chosen a priori from domain knowledge as commonly practiced in the social sciences. ssem learns genetic interactions by both exploratory factor analysis  and sem with various model selection criteria  in a stepwise fashion. the incorporation of msc helps ssem circumvent the overfitting problem. the performance of ssem with six different msc is evaluated using two sets of simulated networks to determine which msc works best. the software ssem automatically runs through all of the steps of ssem, and outputs predicted gene interactions. finally, ssem is applied to infer tc and td interactions for  small groups of genes that are synthetic sick or lethal  to sgs <dig>  and  sgs <dig> or rad <dig> with their ssl partners from  <dig> genes involved in yeast dna synthesis and repair that are of interest. both predictions are verified by an extensive quantitative rt-polymerase chain reaction experiment ; see additional file  <dig> for details.

RESULTS
the msc suitable for predicting genetic networks remains unknown, while an adequate msc can prevent the algorithm from overfitting. thus we have carried out an extensive simulation to evaluate eight criteria used in commercial sem software, such as mplus version  <dig>  <cit> . the results of the top six msc χ2/df, χ2-df, mean square error , akaike information criterion , bayesian information criterion , and adjbic are reported in additional file  <dig>  ssem with bic outperforms all of the others. since the network topology, latent factors ), gene-gene interactions , and latent factor-gene regulations  are well defined for the simulated data, exact quantitative performance can be computed.

results of ssem with various msc using simulated data
time course data from 6-gene and 10-gene regulatory networks with two latent factors are generated. the simulation consists of various sample sizes and noise levels. let xi, yi and εi denote the expression level of latent factor i, gene i and noise variable i, respectively. the linear dynamic factor model  to generate the 6-gene network is as follows:

  y1= <dig> x1+ <dig> y1+ <dig> y2+ε1y2= <dig> x1+ <dig> y2+ <dig> y3+ε2y3= <dig> x1+ <dig> y3+ <dig> y4+ <dig> y5+ε3y4= <dig> x2+ <dig> y5+ε4y5= <dig> x2+ <dig> y5+ε5y6= <dig> x2+ <dig> y4+ <dig> y6+ε <dig> 

where x <dig> ~ n, x <dig> ~ n, yi ~ u, and εi ~ n , i =  <dig> ..., <dig>  note that σi <dig> is determined by the variance of yi and a pre-specified noise level. the noise level is quantified by a contrast-to-noise ratio , defined as the ratio of the signal standard deviation to the noise standard deviation. cnr =  <dig>  or  <dig>  corresponds to high or medium noise levels, respectively. for the 10-gene network, we refer to equation  of simulation.pdf of the supplementary data.

note that both the 6- and 10-gene networks are sparse, which roughly follow the sparse property of cis-regulatory networks  <cit> . for each network, time course data are simulated under various conditions; sample sizes  and noise levels, where t is the number of time points and tmin = 2n +  <dig>  without incorporating any biological knowledge, for a fully connected n-gene network , t = 2n+ <dig> is the minimum number of time points required  for proper estimation of Σ^ in , and hence for all parameters in the model. however, the latest version of ssem can be iterated from a non-fully connected network, and hence the restriction t = 2n+ <dig> no longer exists. table  <dig> summarizes the performance of ssem with aic and bic for the 6-gene network under various settings of . the averages of the true positive rate , true negative rate , and false positive rate  for the top  <dig>  networks, in terms of msc value, in  <dig> experiments are reported. tpr  is the percentage of correctly predicted links from the total existing links  in the simulated network. likewise, tnr  is the percentage of correctly predicted non-existing links  out of the total non-existing links in the simulated network. clearly, ssem with bic outperforms ssem with aic, and the results from the 10-gene network also confirm this.

we further compared ssem with bic to vbem  <cit>  using the 6- and 10-gene networks in simulation.pdf. the results are in table  <dig>  and ssem with bic outperforms vbem in terms of tprs for both networks; details are provided in simulation.pdf.

results on real time course microarray data
in this section, ssem is first applied to infer tc/td interactions for small groups of genes ssl to sgs <dig>  for example csm <dig>  mus <dig>  sis <dig>  swe1and top <dig> in  <cit> . next, ssem infers tc/td interactions from sgs <dig> or rad <dig> ssl gene pairs, formed from  <dig> genes involved in yeast dna synthesis and repair. sgs <dig> encodes a recq dna helicase, of which the homologues in human cells include the wrn, blm and recq <dig> genes. mutation of the sgs <dig> gene results in premature aging in yeast mother cells as well as genome instability. further, these genes and their processes are highly conserved in eukaryotic cells, and mutations in these genes may lead to cancer-predisposition syndromes and symptoms resembling premature aging  <cit> . on the other hand, rad <dig> encodes a structure-specific  endonuclease which has a human homolog, fen1; rad <dig> has a distinct role in processing okazaki fragments during dna synthesis in the s phase. deletion of rad <dig> in cells also causes hypersensitivities to various dna damaging agents  <cit> . rad <dig> was shown to be necessary for maintaining genome stability by restricting dna recombination between short repeated sequences and processing long-patch base excision repair  <cit> .

cdna microarray data from the alpha, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> experiments in  <cit>  were applied to the four algorithms to infer the gene network of interest. the elu data set was not included because it was synchronized differently from alpha, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig>  the experiment and control groups were mrnas extracted from synchronized and non-synchronized yeast cultures, respectively. the synchronization was conducted by treating yeast cultures with alpha factor arrest and arrests of a temperature-sensitive mutant cdc <dig> and mutant cdc <dig>  a full description and complete data sets are available at  <cit> . the red  and green  fluorescence intensities were measured from the mrna abundance in the experiment group and control group, respectively. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> time points in the alpha, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> data sets with no replicates; we first aggregated these three datasets to increase the number of time points to  <dig>  this aggregation was applied in  <cit> , and it resulted in some meaningful gene networks.

log ratios of the six genes' expression levels were fitted to ssem with bic, vbem  <cit> , mapem  <cit>  and lds  <cit>  algorithms. the results were checked against qrt-pcr results . excluding latent factor-gene interactions, the modified true positive rate  of the top model selected by ssem with bic equals 7/ <dig>  while the mtprs of vbem, mapem and lds equal 2/ <dig> , 6/ <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. fitting five genes' expression to a multivariate ar model resulted in 0/ <dig> mtpr; see additional file  <dig> for details. this shows how latent factors improve the estimation of gene interactions w^ and thus mediate proper extraction of biological knowledge. we also ran ssem when the sample size was small  for the 6-gene network, and the mtpr of the top model predicted by ssem equaled 7/ <dig>  for this application, ssem took about  <dig> minutes on pcs with pentium iv  <dig>  ghz and  <dig>  gb ram.

next, ssem was applied to infer tc/td interactions among the  <dig> genes that are ssl to sgs <dig> or rad <dig>  our collaborator has conducted extensive qrt-pcr experiments  to verify that among these predictions, ssem successfully uncovered several tc/td interactions of sgs <dig> with genes involved in dna replication , dna repair , checkpoint arrest  and chromosome segregation . these genetic interactions are consistent with the following experimental results from published literature. sgs <dig> and srs <dig> are known redundant pathways in replication  <cit> ; for instance, srs <dig> and sgs1-top <dig> suppress crossovers during double strand break repair in yeast. further, defects in rad <dig> and other homologous recombination genes suppressed synthetic lethality/sickness of the double mutant sgs1Δ srs2Δ. slx1-slx <dig> was found to be a second structure specific endonuclease functionally redundant with sgs1-top <dig> in  <cit> . the sgs1/top3/rmi <dig> and mus81/mms <dig> complexes are involved in both double-strand break repair and homologous recombination  <cit> . this indicates that sgs1/top3/rmi <dig> and mus81/mms <dig> are alternative pathways to resolve recombination intermediates.  <cit>  identified that sgs <dig> participated in a rad52-dependent recombination pathway.  <cit>  found that rad <dig> and sgs <dig> interacted genetically and possibly physically. cells lacking sgs <dig> frequently arrest as large-budded cells with a single nucleus in the mother cell, or "stuck" between mother and daughter cells, which resulted in missegregation during mitosis  <cit> , whereas csm <dig> is required for dna replication checkpoint and accurate chromosome segregation. similarly, ssem was applied to predict the interactions of the fifteen ssl pairs of rad <dig>  and among them hpr <dig>  sgs <dig>  mus <dig>  esc <dig>  hst <dig>  hst <dig> and csm <dig> had tc interactions with rad <dig>  whereas rad <dig>  hpr <dig>  sis <dig>  sod <dig>  hpc <dig>  lys <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig> had td interactions with rad <dig>  for the second application, ssem took about  <dig> to  <dig> hours on pcs with pentium iv  <dig>  ghz and  <dig> gb ram.

the results involving sgs <dig> reinforce the possibility of applying genetic interactions to predict pathways of protein complexes  <cit> . the predictions of rad <dig> are intriguing to biologists since biological experiments to screen all possible interactions have been prohibitive thus far. note that ssem can also be applied to infer tc interactions of  <dig> ssl gene pairs in  <cit>  or other large networks with a similar structure, for instance the other six groups of ssl pairs involving arc <dig>  arp <dig>  bbc <dig>  bim <dig>  bni <dig> and nbp <dig>  the large network of  <dig> ssl pairs can be broken down to subgroups that center on sgs <dig>  rad <dig>  the above six genes, and other hub genes. then each subgroup can be inferred individually, similarly to the group involving sgs <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the novelties and merits of ssem are as follows. first, ssem expands the scope of application of most algorithms in the area of gene networks. specifically, ssem is shown to predict several tc/td interactions of sgs <dig> accurately, verified by qrt-pcr experiments, and these interactions coincide with existing pathways. further, ssem predicts a few novel tc/td interactions involving rad <dig>  and these predictions can be verified by biological experiments. importantly, ssem can be further applied to predict genetic interactions of other large networks with a similar structure, while biological experiments to screen all possible interactions may be prohibitive. second, ssem extends the approach in  <cit>  such that it can infer both latent factor-gene and gene-gene interactions simultaneously. third, ssem incorporates an msc in a stepwise fashion to circumvent the overfitting problem. although ssem was shown to infer genetic networks using time course data with no replicates, it can also be applied to short time course data with replicates by modifying the terms involved in replicates and the sample size. as technology advances, we anticipate more data sets with replicates to become available and a greater demand for algorithms like ssem to infer gene networks.

using ssem with the model in equation  has been shown to outperform fitting a multivariate autoregressive model straightforwardly. this demonstrates the important role of latent factors and the efficiency of ssem. further, ssem outperforms three bayesian network algorithms that impose linear models on latent factors, while ssem does not assume any structure on latent factors. however, ssem shares one drawback with continuous bayesian networks. both approaches assume that the vector of log ratios of gene expression y follows a multivariate normal distribution. this assumption may limit its application, although log ratios of gene expression do follow a normal distribution in most cases.

although ssem may serve as an exploratory tool for genetic interactions, the model in  is an approximation to the true model, and bic is a large-sample result. further improvements for future research include finding a novel msc for ssem when the sample size is small, and developing a nonlinear model with latent factors or a lag-k and k >  <dig> in time to model genetic interactions. the goal of ssem is to model small to medium networks with precise prediction instead of modeling large or genome-wide networks with inaccurate prediction. some results on incorporating various types of data, e.g. motif information, and chip-chip data besides microarray data, to predict transcriptional modules have been explored in the literature  <cit> . however, integrating various types of data for reliable prediction of complex genetic networks remains a challenging topic, and we leave this for future research.
