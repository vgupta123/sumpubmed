BACKGROUND
phosphorus is an essential component of all cells. in bacteria, phosphorus is typically assimilated as inorganic orthophosphate  via the reactions of the energy and carbon metabolism, thus, the phosphorus metabolism is closely intertwined with the energy and the central carbon metabolism. an optimal energy and carbon metabolism is possible only with sufficient phosphorus supply. as precursor metabolites for the biosynthesis of amino acids are derived from central carbon metabolism, the interplay of phosphorus and carbon metabolism is of particular interest in amino acid producing corynebacterium glutamicum strains.

pi is taken up into the cell by specific transport systems. when pi becomes scarce, many bacteria induce the synthesis of proteins to use limiting concentrations of pi more efficiently and to make alternative sources of phosphorus accessible. the regulation of the pi starvation response of escherichia coli  <cit>  and bacillus subtilis  <cit>  has been studied in detail. in e. coli, the two component regulatory system phor-phob is responsible for the induction of the pi starvation genes. under pi starvation conditions, the histidine kinase phor phosphorylates the response regulator phob and phosphorylated phob induces the transcription of at least  <dig> genes, the so-called phob regulon. among these genes are the phobr operon encoding two component regulatory system, the pstscab-phou operon encoding an abc transporter for high-affinity pi uptake and an regulatory protein, and the ugpbaecq operon encoding an sn-glycerol 3-phosphate abc uptake system and glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase. the phob regulon in e. coli also comprises  <dig> genes important for uptake and degradation of phosphonates, e.g. the phncdefghijklmnop operon. in b. subtilis, the pi starvation response is dependent on the two component system phop-phor for activation of pho regulon, spo0a for termination of the pi starvation response and subsequent initiation of sporulation, resde for the full induction of the pho regulon genes and the regulator abrb. in addition, pi starvation in b. subtilis leads to the induction of genes of the general stress response, mediated by σb and σm . under pi starvation conditions, b. subtilis replaces teichoic acids in the cell-wall with the non-phosphate containing teichuronic acids due to repression of the teichoic acid biosynthesis operons tagab and tagdef and derepression of the teichuronic acid biosynthesis operon tuaabcdefgh  <cit> .

c. glutamicum was isolated in  <dig> as an l-glutamate excreting bacterium  <cit>  and is used for the large scale biotechnological production of l-glutamate and l-lysine  <cit> . this bacterium has been engineered for the production of other amino acids such as l-serine  <cit> , l-isoleucine  <cit> , l-valine  <cit>  or l-proline  <cit> . it has been also successfully engineered to produce derivatives or precursors of amino acids such as  <dig> -diaminobutane  <cit>   <dig> -diaminopentane  <cit> , 2-ketoisovalerate  <cit>  and 2-ketoisocaproate  <cit> .

in c. glutamicum, phosphorus constitutes  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % of the cell dry weight  <cit> . under pi sufficient conditions, c. glutamicum accumulates cytoplasmic and granular polyphosphate . polyphosphate is synthesized by class ii polyphosphate kinases  <cit> . for utilization, it is hydrolysed by exopolyphosphatases  <cit>  and replaces atp in the reactions of nad kinase ppnk  <cit>  and glucokinase ppgk  <cit> . although intracellular polyphosphate was shown to serve as reservoir of phosphorus  <cit> , expression of a number of genes involved in phosphorus metabolism is induced within 1 h after a shift from pi sufficient to pi limiting conditions  <cit> . as determined by global gene expression analysis using whole-genome c. glutamicum dna microarrays  <cit> , the pi starvation stimulon comprises among others pstscab encoding an abc transporter for high affinity pi uptake, ugpabce encoding an sn-glycerol 3-phosphate abc uptake system, usha encoding a secreted enzyme with udp sugar hydrolase and 5’nucleotidase activity  <cit> , and the phors operon encoding for the two component system involved in the pi starvation response of c. glutamicum  <cit> . purified phosphorylated phor was shown to bind to the promoters of pi starvation-inducible genes at sites containing a loosely conserved 8-bp direct repeat  <cit> . transcriptome analyses of c. glutamicum wt and the deletion mutant Δphors revealed that the known pi starvation-inducible genes were not induced within 1 h after a shift from pi excess to pi limitation, with the exception of the pstscab operon, which was still partially induced in the deletion mutant  <cit> . this indicated that at least one additional regulator besides phor is involved in pi-dependent regulation of the pstscab operon in c. glutamicum. glxr, a global camp-dependent transcriptional regulator , was shown to bind to the psts promoter −133 bps to −117 bps upstream of the transcriptional start site and activates the pstscab operon under phosphate limiting conditions in a carbon source dependent manner  <cit> . when glxr was overexpressed, growth was enhanced under phosphate limiting conditions on glucose as carbon source, but not on acetate  <cit> . moreover, a metabolome analysis of c. glutamicum grown on acetate or glucose revealed a link between pi limitation and accumulation of glycogen and maltose  <cit> . however, mutation of glxr binding site in the psts promoter sequence did not abolish the expression of the reporter gene. this indicated the existence of other factor involved in regulation of psts operon under pi starvation conditions. the aim of this study was to characterize adaptation of c. glutamicum to pi starvation in the absence of phos-phor and to identify additional regulator of pstscab.

RESULTS
growth of c. glutamicum wt and Δphors on different phosphorus sources and under pi limiting conditions
to characterize the long-term response of c. glutamicum to pi limitation and growth on alternative phosphorus sources, comparative growth experiments were performed with c. glutamicum wt and with the deletion mutant Δphors, which lacks the two-component regulatory system phors   <cit> . c. glutamicum wt and Δphors were pre-cultured for 24 h in cgxii glucose medium without pi in order to exhaust the intercellular phosphorus storages  <cit>  and inoculated into cgxii glucose medium with either a limiting pi concentration of  <dig>  mm or with 1 mm of the alternative phosphorus sources of adenosine 5’-monophosphate , l-α-glycerophosphate or udp-glucose.table  <dig> strains and plasmids used in this study

c. glutamicum Δphors could utilize the alternative phosphorus sources l-α-glycerophosphate, 5’amp and udp-glucose, however, it showed longer lag phases, lower growth rates and lower biomass yields than c. glutamicum wt . as growth of c. glutamicum on 5'-amp and udp-glucose requires the pi starvation inducible gene usha, which encodes a secreted enzyme with udp-glucose hydrolase and 5'-nucleotidase activity  <cit> , udp-glucose hydrolase activity of supernatants of these cultures were measured. while udp-glucose hydrolase activity could not be detected under pi sufficient conditions , supernatants of c. glutamicum wt and Δphors grown with l-α-glycerophosphate, 5’amp and udp-glucose as sole phosphorus sources showed udp-glucose hydrolase activity . taken together, phors is not essential for growth with these organophosphates and other regulators apparently allow c. glutamicum to induce usha and possibly other genes necessary for the pi starvation response in the absence of phors.

deletion analysis of the psts promoter
to identify cis-regulatory sequences of the psts promoter for the phor-dependent and phor-independent control, a deletion analysis of the psts promoter region was performed using different oligonucleotides . the psts promoter fragment  and the promoter fragments either lacking the 5' region  or the 3' region  were fused to the promoter-less chloramphenicol acetyl transferase  gene . the resulting plasmids pet2-rf <dig>  pet2-r0f <dig>  pet2-r1f <dig>  pet2-r2f <dig>  pet2-r0f <dig>  pet2-r0f <dig> and pet2-r0f <dig> were transferred into c. glutamicum wt and Δphors. expression of these fusions was assayed before and 90 min after a shift from pi rich to pi lacking medium. the fusion with fragment r3f <dig> was not expressed as it lacked the previously determined transcriptional start site and the − <dig> and − <dig> binding regions of the rna polymerase   <cit> . all other fusions were expressed and showed pi starvation-inducible expression both in c. glutamicum wt and Δphors .table  <dig> oligonucleotides used in this study

expression of the reporter gene fused to the full-length psts promoter in c. glutamicum wt  was about threefold higher than in c. glutamicum Δphors , while expression of the other fusions did not differ much between wt and Δphors . this indicated that fragment r0f <dig> lacked a cis regulatory sequence required for activation by phors under pi starvation conditions and it is consistent with the finding of a phors binding site in this region  <cit> . also the fusions in pet2-r1f <dig> and pet2-r2f <dig>  which lack the previously determined glxr binding site, were expressed in c. glutamicum wt as well as in Δphors upon pi starvation.

pi starvation induction of the pstscab operon is stronger and faster than that of other pi starvation inducible genes of c. glutamicum  <cit>  and its induction is partially retained in the absence of phors  <cit> . therefore, the time dependent expression from pet2-rf <dig> and pet2-r0f <dig> was analyzed in c. glutamicum wt and Δphors under pi starvation. after a shift from pi-sufficient to pi-limiting conditions, expression of the psts promoter fusion in pet2-rf <dig> was induced in c. glutamicum wt and Δphors before 60 min . however, pi starvation induction of the psts promoter in the phors mutant followed slower kinetics and reached a two to three fold lower level than in c. glutamicum wt. on the other hand, induction was very similar between the full-length psts promoter  in the phors mutant and the psts promoter lacking phor binding site  in the wild type. thus, expression control of the psts promoter by phors in vivo required the cognate phor binding site, which is present in the full-length promoter fragment , but absent from the  <dig> nucleotides shorter fragment . furthermore, the fragment r0f <dig> apparently contains all cis regulatory sequences required for pi starvation induction independent of phors. moreover, the fusions lacking the phor and the glxr binding sites  were still induced under pi starvation conditions. thus, besides phors, which is required for maximal pi starvation induction of pstscab, and glxr,  aditional unknown regulator are involved in control of pstscab expression during adaptation of c. glutamicum to pi limitation.

identification of ramb as a protein binding to the psts promoter
in order to identify  regulatory protein binding to the psts promoter region, we coupled the biotinylated psts promoter fragment r0f <dig> to dynabeads® streptavidin for dna affinity purification experiments. dna affinity chromatography was performed with crude extracts from c. glutamicum wt  and deletion mutant Δphors in cgxii minimal medium with  <dig> %  glucose . in these experiments, a number of proteins bound to the promoter dna fragment. by tryptic finger print analysis using maldi-tof mass spectrometry, some of these proteins could be identified. among proteins binding the promoter dna in a sequence-independent manner  the transcriptional regulator ramb was identified . the regulator of acetate metabolism ramb is known to repress transcription of the pta-ack operon, the acea and aceb genes encoding enzymes for acetate activation and of the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . therefore, the dna affinity chromatography experiments were repeated using crude extracts of c. glutamicum wt cultivated on acetate minimal medium under pi starvation conditions. as a result, glxr and ramb were found to bind to the full-length psts promoter dna . binding of ramb to the psts promoter dna suggested its involvement in direct control of the pstscab operon.fig.  <dig> sds-page images of dna affinity chromatography experiment and purified ramb protein.  proteins eluted from a dna affinity chromatography experiment using the psts promoter. for the dna affinity chromatography experiment, the psts promoter fragment r0f <dig> was used as a probe and incubated with cell extracts of c. glutamicum Δphors grown under pi sufficient conditions in minimal medium with  <dig> %  glucose . 1: dna-polymerase i, 2: acetyl/propionyl-coa carboxylase subunit, 3: acetyl/propionyl-coa carboxylase subunit, 4: dna gyrase, 5: dna-directed rna polymerase β-subunit, 6: dna-directed rna polymerase β’-subunit. left lane: protein standard seeblue ii prestained standard   purified his-tagged ramb. his-tagged ramb was over produced in e. coli, purified and separated on a  <dig> %  sds-polyacrylamide gel. gel was stained with coomassie blue. left lane: protein standard seeblue ii prestained standard , right lane: purified his-tagged ramb obtained after imidazol elution from a nickel-chelate affinity column



purified ramb binds to two binding motifs in the psts promoter in vitro
ramb binding sites  are present upstream of many genes encoding enzymes of the central carbon metabolism that belong to the acetate stimulon  <cit> . however, a ramb binding site within the psts promoter region has not yet been reported. inspection of the psts promoter dna suggested the occurrence of two partially conserved ramb binding sites, motif a and motif b: agaa-tttgccga  and the reverse complement of acgactt-aaaaa .

in order to test whether ramb directly binds to the psts promoter dna, band shift assays with purified ramb were performed. ramb containing a c-terminal his-tag was overproduced in e. coli bl <dig>  and purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography . gel shift assays showed that ramb bound with a high affinity to the full-length psts promoter, but not to the negative control fragment cg <dig> . gel shift assays with the different fragments of the psts promoter lacking the 5' region  showed binding of ramb to respective dna fragments except for the fragment r3f <dig>  which lacked both of the predicted ramb binding sites . ramb bound weaker to the fragment r2f <dig>  which contains one of the predicted binding site , than to other fragments which contain both of the predicted binding sites . similarly, the affinity of ramb to fragment rf <dig>  which contains only one of the predicted ramb binding site , was weaker than that to the full-length psts promoter fragment  . these results suggested the presence of two ramb binding sites in the full-length psts promoter fragment.fig.  <dig> binding of ramb to various psts promoter fragments.  gel shift assay with ramb and the fragment of the psts promoter lacking 5' region. ramb protein  was incubated with the full-length psts promoter  or the different fragments of the psts promoter lacking 5' region  and applied for native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a 185 bp promoter fragment of cg <dig> served as a negative control.  gel shift assay with ramb and the fragment of the psts promoter lacking 3' region. ramb protein  was incubated with the psts promoter  or fragment of the psts promoter lacking 3' region  and applied for native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a 122 bp promoter fragment of dtxr served as a negative control



a mutational analysis was performed to determine whether both of the partially conserved ramb binding motifs are required for interaction of ramb with the psts promoter. mutations of ramb binding motif a , ramb binding motif b , or of both ramb binding motifs  were introduced into the psts promoter fragment rcfc, which contained both putative binding sites within a 124 bp region . ramb did not bind to the fragment rmfm containing both mutated binding sites. ramb interacted stronger with non-mutated fragment rcfc than with the fragments rcfm and rmfc, each only containing one intact binding site . thus, both binding sites contribute to binding of ramb to the psts promoter in vitro.fig.  <dig> binding of ramb to various psts promoter fragments. ramb protein  was incubated with the full-length psts promoter fragment  or the partial length psts promoter fragments  and applied for native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a 267 bp fragment of r3f <dig>  which lacked both of ramb binding sites, served as a negative control



role of ramb sites for regulation of the psts promoter in vivo
in order to determine the role of ramb for pi starvation induction of the psts promoter in vivo, expression of psts promoter fusion to the promoter-less cat reporter gene was analyzed in c. glutamicum wt on different carbon sources after a shift from pi-sufficient to pi starvation conditions. these medium shift experiments were performed with minimal medium containing either  <dig> %  glucose or  <dig> %  potassium acetate as sole carbon source. expression of the psts promoter fusion r0f <dig> after a shift from pi-sufficient to pi starvation conditions was higher on glucose than on acetate . pi starvation induced expression of the fusion with the shorter rcfc promoter fragment, which lacks the phor and glxr binding sites, and induction was six fold higher onglucose than on acetate . when mutations were introduced in only one of ramb binding sites , expression was reduced both on glucose and acetate. the rmfm fusion carrying mutations in both ramb binding sites showed almost no activity after medium shift on both carbon source .table  <dig> expression of various psts promoter fragment cat fusions in c. glutamicum wt

in addition, expression of the psts promoter fusion r0f <dig> was assayed in the deletion mutant Δramb growing in  <dig> %  glucose as a carbon source before and after pi starvation induction. before pi starvation, expression of the psts promoter fusion was low, both in wt and in Δramb , while pi starvation induction was higher in wt as compared to Δramb . taken together, ramb as well as both ramb binding sites are important for pi starvation induction of the psts promoter in c. glutamicum in vivo.

comparison of pi starvation inducible gene expression on glucose and acetate minimal medium
as pi starvation induction of the psts promoter differed with respect to the carbon source, dna microarray analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profile on minimal medium containing either glucose or acetate during the pi starvation response. c. glutamicum cells growing exponentially on glucose or acetate minimal medium with 13 mm pi were shifted to minimal medium containing either glucose or acetate but lacking pi. rna was prepared 90 min after the medium shift. as expected for acetate dependent regulation in c. glutamicum  <cit> , the dna microarray analysis revealed two to  <dig> fold higher mrna levels for genes belonging to the acetate stimulon on acetate than on glucose: pta encoding phosphotransacetylase, acea and aceb encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, pck encoding gluconeogenetic pep carboxykinase, acn encoding aconiatase and glta encoding citrate synthase . expression of ramb was about four fold higher on glucose than on acetate due to autoregulation by ramb and control by rama  <cit> . expression of genes of the pstscab operon was higher on glucose than on acetate in response to pi starvation, which is consistent with the psts promoter fusion experiments in this study . in addition, expression of other genes belonging to the pi starvation stimulon reached higher levels on glucose than on acetate: usha encoding 5’-nucleotidase, psib encoding a putative alkaline phosphatase, phoh <dig> encoding a putative atpase, cg <dig> encoding a phnb-like protein, pctc of the pctabcd operon encoding an abc transport system and ugpa and ugpe of the ugpeabc operon encoding an glycerol-3-phosphate uptake system . unlike other genes of the pi starvation stimulon, expression of phos and phor encoding phosphate sensor kinase and its response regulator was lower on glucose than on acetate during pi starvation .table  <dig> genes differentially expressed in either glucose or acetate minimal medium cultures of c. glutamicum wt after a shift from pi-sufficient to pi-limiting conditions

discussion
here we have shown that ramb is involved in expression control of the pstscab operon during the pi starvation response of c. glutamicum. the two component regulatory system phor-phos is neither essential for pi starvation induction of pstscab nor for growth on media with the organophosphates glycerol-3-phosphate, 5’-amp and udp-glucose as sole phosphorus source. however, phor-phos ensures rapid and maximal pi starvation induction of pstscab. the regulator of acetate metabolism ramb was shown to bind to two binding sites in the psts promoter fragment in vitro and both of two binding sites were shown to influence the activity of the psts promoter fragment in vivo by reporter gene assay. pi starvation induction of the psts promoter fragment reached  <dig> fold higher levels on glucose minimal medium than on acetate minimal medium. microarray experiments showed that pi starvation induction of ramb and the pi starvation stimulon including pstscab reached higher rna levels with glucose as carbon source than with acetate as carbon source. these findings support and extend a regulatory link between phosphorus and carbon metabolism in c. glutamicum  <cit> .

the regulator of acetate metabolism ramb represses transcription of the pta-ack operon and the acea and aceb genes, which encode enzymes for acetate activation and for the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter regions of these genes allowed identifying conserved 13-bp motifs as ramb binding sites  <cit> . a bioinformatics analysis of the genome sequence revealed that variants of the cis-regulatory motif for ramb binding were identified upstream of acea, aceb, pta-ack and also occur in the promoter regions of  <dig> other genes,  <dig> of which were differentially expressed in acetate- and glucose-grown c. glutamicum cells. these genes code for enzymes of e.g. glucose uptake, glycolysis, glucoeneogenesis, anaplerosis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit> . while this bioinformatic analysis searched for variants of the ramb binding site  with maximal mismatches of two nucleotides  <cit> , the newly identified ramb binding sites in the pstscab promoter were not recognized previously as they contain  <dig>  and  <dig> mismatches ), respectively. mutational analysis of the ramb binding sites in the psts promoter fragment showed that ramb binds to both of the newly identified ramb binding sites in vitro and that both binding sites are relevant for regulation of the psts promoter under pi limiting condition in vivo. thus, ramb appears to activate pstscab expression under pi limiting conditions. while ramb mostly represses its target genes, ramb was shown to activate acee encoding the e1p subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  <cit> .

glxr also links regulation of carbon and phosphorus metabolism in c. glutamicum. glxr is known to regulate more than  <dig> genes and is one of the global hubs within the c. glutamicum gene-regulatory network  <cit> . glxr was shown to bind to the psts promoter in a camp-dependent manner in vitro  <cit>  and the interaction of glxr with psts promoter dna was higher on glucose than on acetate as carbon source in c. glutamicum  <cit> . in this study, expression of the reporter gene fusion with the full length psts promoter  was higher under pi starvation conditions than expression of the fusion lacking the phor binding site  and even higher than expression of the fusion lacking both the phor and glxr binding sites  . thus, the three transcriptional regulators phor, glxr and ramb synergistically activate expression of the psts operon under pi starvation conditions.

glxr, rama and ramb also regulate transcription of their genes, e.g. glxr activates rama and represses ramb  <cit> , rama activates ramb  <cit>  and glxr, rama and ramb show negative autoregulation . moreover, a number of target genes of ramb and rama are also regulated by glxr, e,g, adha and ald encoding alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit>  as well as glta encoding citrate synthase  <cit>  are repressed by both glxr and ramb, but activated by rama, rpf <dig> encoding resuscitation promoting factor  <dig> is activated by rama and glxr, but repressed by ramb  <cit> . negative autoregulation of ramb, carbon source-dependent activation of ramb by rama  <cit>  and camp-dependent activation of ramb by glxr fine-tune regulation of carbon metabolism and also serve to integrate regulation of carbon and phosphorus metabolism in c. glutamicum.

regulation of pstscab in c. glutamicum is complex, involves at least three transcriptional regulators: phor  <cit> , glxr  <cit>  and ramb  and differs from regulation of the psts promoter in m. tuberculosis, e. coli and b. subtilis. notably, in the related actinomycete mycobacterium tuberculosis transcription of the pst operon is not induced upon pi starvation. since m. tuberculosis can replicate in the phagosomes of macrophages, an acidic and pi poor environment, constitutive expression of pst may be a consequence of this intracellular life style  <cit> . in e. coli, the psts promoter is regulated by integration host factor  and phob  <cit> , whereas this promoter is regulated in b. subtilis by phop  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in c. glutamicum, ramb is involved in expression control of the pstscab operon and two binding sites are relevant for activation by ramb in vitro. these finding support the notion that phosphorus and carbon metabolism in c. glutamicum are regulated in dependence of each other. transcriptional regulation of pstscab is complex involving activation by the phosphate-responsive two-component regulatory system phosr and the regulators of carbon metabolism glxr and ramb.
