BACKGROUND
during meiosis, homologous recombination is initiated by spo11-catalyzed machinery at dna double strand breaks. in many species, recombination events are clustered in localized regions of a few kb long, called recombination hotspots. understanding the regulatory mechanisms of recombination hotspots can shed light on birth defect diseases, molecular evolution, genome instability, etc.  <cit> . therefore, it is desirable to understand how the locations and intensities of recombination hotspots are regulated.

for the regulatory mechanisms of recombination hotspots, striking progress has been made recently, thanks to the high-throughput genomic technology and bioinformatics techniques. myers et al. used the ldhat software to estimate the fine-scale genome-wide recombination hotspots from hapmap phase ii snp data  <cit> . from the hotspots, a list of motifs has been discovered, in which the two most prominent motifs are the 7-mer cctccct and the 9-mer ccccacccc. interestingly, when located inside the1a/b repeats, the motifs have much stronger association with proximal hotspots than outside the repeats. the 7-mer motif was later extended to a degenerate 13-mer motif ccnccntnnccnc  <cit> . moreover, the 13-mer motif contains the sequence pattern of 3-periodicity, indicating a zinc finger binding array. then, three groups reported the discovery of prdm <dig> protein as a trans-acting regulator of the locations and intensities of meiotic recombination hotspots in human and mouse  <cit> . strikingly, prdm <dig> protein binds to the aforementioned 13-mer motif. the discovery of prdm <dig> protein and its binding motifs was a major breakthrough in the understanding of the regulation of meiotic recombination hotspots. however, it has been observed that prdm <dig> is not indispensable for recombination hotspots; for example, in prdm <dig> knockout mouse germ line, meiotic recombination hotspots are still observed  <cit> . overall, prdm <dig> can explain about 18% of the variations in human recombination hotspots  <cit>  and the 13-mer motif occurs in about 40% of human hotspots  <cit> . therefore, additional trans and cis-regulatory elements for meiotic recombination hotspots remain to be discovered. some recent efforts have been made toward this goal  <cit> . moreover, follow-up investigation of the functions of prdm <dig>  e.g. its detailed mechanism to mediate the location and intensity of meiotic recombination, is also under intense research  <cit> .

the discovery of dna sequence motifs that stimulate meiotic recombination is crucial to the uncovering of the regulatory mechanisms of recombination hotspots. several approaches have been developed for this purpose. the first approach is based on yeast mutagenesis. after genetically mapping the locations of meiotic recombination hotspots, steiner et al. carried out base-pair substitution screening on the genome of fission yeast to scan for dna sequences responsible for the activities of hotspots  <cit> . they identified  <dig> dna motifs stimulating recombination hotspots, and showed evidence for the existence of more motifs. the second approach is the computational search for short dna sequences that are significantly enriched in hotspots against cold spots  <cit> . its success in identifying the 13-mer binding motif of the prdm <dig> protein shows the power of bioinformatics methods for the study of genetic recombination  <cit> . however, this approach has several caveats. first, the statistical associations based on counting of co-localization of hotspot and motif may not correspond to biological causal relations. second, due to the limited power of computational detection of hotspots based on ld patterns, and the difficulty of finding degenerate motifs genome-wide, false negative remains a serious issue. the discovery of the 13-mer motif was based on two exact shorter motifs  with two bases in between, which required close manual inspections  <cit> .

it is desirable and challenging to design bioinformatics algorithms to automatically detect degenerate motifs for recombination hotspots in large-scale. to this end, additional information is needed to increase the statistical power of motif detection. one type of such information is the association between sequence polymorphisms with the variation in recombination rates of a hotspot. evidence of such association has been demonstrated by sperm typing. for instance, individuals with different alleles at the fg <dig> snp located within the dna <dig> hotspot have 20-fold difference in recombination rate of the dna <dig> hotspot  <cit> . a similar case was reported for the nid <dig> hotspot  <cit> . myers et al. noted that the two snps associated with the dna <dig> and nid <dig> hotspots discovered by sperm typing are located within the motifs  after the motifs had been identified; however, information of sequence polymorphism did not contribute to the discovery of motifs. in extending the 7-mer motif to the degenerate 13-mer motif  <cit> , myers et al. did compare the original and disrupt forms of motifs due to mutations, however they only compared motif occurrences in different hotspots in the human reference genome, rather than polymorphisms of the same motif occurrence and variations of intensities at the same hotspot  among different individuals. therefore, in the above computational approach, genetic variation information encoded in the dna sequence polymorphisms has not been fully used for motif discovery.

recently we have designed an algorithm called ldsplit to detect dna sequence polymorphisms associated with individual meiotic recombination hotspots, and thereby discover cis-regulatory elements of these hotspots  <cit> . given a sample of haplotypes  flanking a hotspot h, ldsplit first splits the haplotypes into two subsets according to alleles of a candidate snp a . then, ldsplit compares the population recombination rate of the hotspot h between the two subsets calculated by ldhat algorithm  <cit> . the rationale is that, if the snp a is located in a cis-regulatory element  of the hotspot h, then one allele of snp a represents a mutation that disrupts the motif. as a result, the subset of haplotypes with that disruptive allele should have lower intensity of hotspot h than the other allele. this is the case for the sperm typing examples of dna <dig> hotspot and nid <dig> hotspot. this method is based on the assumption that population genetics methods  for estimation of recombination rate by inferring historical crossovers from ld patterns should be able to capture the extant difference of hotspot intensities between the two alleles, which has been supported by some evidence  <cit> . extensive tests on simulated and real data demonstrated the effectiveness of ldsplit to capture cis-regulatory genomic loci associated with recombination hotspots  <cit> . however, the software implementation of ldsplit needs an accessible user interface to be shared with research community, and it needs further validation with real data.

in this paper we report a significant upgrading to the implementation of ldsplit algorithm, and also demonstrate that ldsplit can help discover dna sequence motifs stimulating recombination by narrowing down to cis-regulatory genomic regions. first, we have implemented a user-friendly graphic interface  for the ldsplit algorithm. compared with the previous implementation using perl, this version is implemented in java, which is more efficient and platform independent, running under windows, linux and mac os. it provides computational unsophisticated users from life sciences a convenient access to the software. more importantly, the integrative scientific visualization of genetic data  shows informative details about the genomic context of hotspots, which greatly facilitate explorative analysis of genetic factors of recombination hotspots. far more than being incremental, this upgrading significantly enhances the usefulness and impact of ldsplit algorithm for the biomedical research. second, to demonstrate the effectiveness of ldsplit, we carry out a focused analysis of snps falling inside the well known 7-mer motif cctccct, which is the core of the binding motif of prdm <dig>  running ldsplit on hapmap  snps flanking the 7-mer motif, we observe that the original form of the 7-mer motif tends to have higher ld-based recombination rates than the disrupt form . this is evidence that, in spite of biased gene conversion, ldsplit is able to capture the allele-specific intensities of hotspots. third, to validate ldsplit by demonstrating its ability to uncover the 7-mer motif, we picked haplotype windows of about  <dig> snps each flanking a hotspot containing an occurrence of the 7-mer motif cctccct, and then ran ldsplit on each snp window. from the output of ldsplit, snps with the most significant p-values are extended to short dna sequences, which were fed into the motif-finding algorithm of meme  <cit> . we found that the top two motifs found by meme from the top snps given by ldsplit match closely the 7-mer motif. in contrast, when running on dna sequences flanking snps randomly chosen from the windows , none of the output motifs is similar to the 7-mer motif. this test on the well known 7-mer motif shows that ldsplit can narrow down to target cis-regulatory elements for meiotic recombination, which significantly increases the power of motif-finding algorithms like meme  <cit> . moreover, we carried out simulation studies by inserting two artificially generated motifs near snps simulated to be associated with hotspots. ldsplit is able to guide meme to identify both motifs as top hits. therefore, ldsplit can be used to discover novel dna sequence motifs, including hotspots of human and mouse that have not been covered by prdm <dig> and many species whose cis-regulatory motifs for recombination hotspots are yet unknown.

implementation
the rationale of ldsplit is that, if a snp is associated with a recombination hotspot, then between two alleles of the snp the strengths of the hotspot are likely to be different. it is based on the assumption that historical recombination rate estimated by ld-based computational methods can approximate the extant recombination rate accurately. based on this rationale, the ldsplit algorithm is designed as follows . for each candidate snp, ldsplit first divides the population of chromosomes into two subpopulations by snp alleles . then it calls the rhomap program  in the ldhat package  to estimate the recombination rates for each subpopulation, and calculates the normalized difference  of hotspot strengths between the snp alleles as /, where ρ <dig> and ρ <dig> denote the strengths of the hotspot in two different subpopulations. the p-value of the hotspot-snp association is estimated by comparing the observed Δρ with the null distribution of random Δρ simulated by permutation tests .

the implementation of ldsplit consists of two stages. first, ldhat is called to calculate the recombination profiles for subpopulations split by snp alleles and pseudo-population in permutation tests. second, the p-values of hotspot-snp associations are estimated and the recombination profiles of sub-populations are displayed. in the rest of this section, we will describe the two stages of ldsplit in detail. the source code and user manual of ldsplit are available for free download on its website .

stage 1: calculating recombination profiles

we apply ldhat to calculate recombination profiles for a window consisting of sequences of snps . there are three types of recombination profiles:  the profile of the whole input population of haplotypes;  profiles of sub-populations of haplotypes each corresponding to an allele of a candidate snp ;  profiles of pseudo-populations from a random split of the input population. meanwhile, the input snp data in this stage consist of two text files, namely the sites file  and the locs file . both types of files can be extracted from hapmap snp database by cutting a window of haplotypes. ldsplit provides a friendly user interface to cut a window from hapmap data and generate the sites and locs files. in addition, the user can set the parameters involved in this stage . as ldhat is computationally costly, this stage of ldsplit usually takes a long time on a regular personal computer . hence it is better to batch this computation. the output of this stage can be exported to hard disk as a java serialization file, which can be loaded back into ldsplit for analysis in the next stage.

stage 2: deriving hotspot-snp associations

using the data output in the first stage, ldsplit visualizes the recombination profiles of the whole and sub-populations of chromosomes for exploratory analysis. to estimate hotspot-snp associations, users first choose the boundaries of a hotspot using two sliders. for the chosen hotspot, ldsplit calculates the p-value of its association with every proximal snp with minor allele frequency  no less than a threshold  in the window. for every candidate snp, users can browse the recombination profiles of its two alleles . the physical positions of snps are shown as yellow dots below the recombination profiles, and user can click buttons  to navigate among candidate snps  and inspect their allele-specific recombination profiles. moreover, the histogram of random Δρ values from the permutations tests and the observed Δρ value for a snp chosen by users will be displayed in a window on the top-right panel, illustrating how p-values are calculated. a table on the bottom-right panel displays the p-values and positions of all candidate snps, and user can save it to a text file for further analysis . to identify dna sequence motifs associated with recombination hotspots, one can search for dna sequence patterns conserved in proximal regions of the identified snps using some motif-finding program such as meme  <cit> .


the software of ldsplit was implemented in java, with a user-friendly graphical interface . for detailed instructions of using ldsplit, please see its user manual included in the package of ldsplit.

simulation
to demonstrate that ldsplit can help narrow down to hotspot associated motifs, we simulated recombination hotspots and flanking snps using simupop , a forward-time population genetics simulation framework  <cit> . in each test, a simupop based python script was run to simulate the evolution of a population of around  <dig>  individuals during many generations  using a forward-time model. each individual had a pair of homologous haplotypes spanning 200 kb of dna. each haplotype was represented as a list of snps with alleles  <dig> and  <dig> 

a simulated hotspot was located at the central point of haplotypes, and a causal snp, whose alleles resulted in different probabilities of crossover at the recombination hotspot, was inserted at the position of 100 kb. in each generation, we randomly selected pairs of individuals as parents. assuming one crossover event in a chromosome of 200 mb per meiosis, in 200 kb the background probability of a crossover would be  <dig> . when the hot allele of the causal snp is present, the probability of a crossover would be increased to  <dig> . in addition, the crossover position was chosen with the probability under normal distribution with mean at position 100 kb where the center of hotspot is located. at the end of simulation, a simulated population was exported, from which we randomly collected  <dig> subsets, each consisting of  <dig> individuals  as benchmark snp data. the snps were extended with randomly generated dna sequences, and artificial motifs were inserted spanning the causal snps. the snp and dna sequence data would then be fed into ldsplit and meme to test if they are able to identify the motifs.

RESULTS
as a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of ldsplit software for the discovery of cis-regulatory motifs of meiotic recombination hotspots, we will analyze the 7-mer motif of cctccct, which has been established as the core binding motif of prdm <dig>  first, running ldsplit, we confirm that, when the 7-mer motif containing a snp is disrupted by one allele of the snp, its proximal hotspot would have lower intensity estimated from ld patterns. second, we show that ldsplit can guide the discovery of the 7-mer motif by narrowing down to genomic regions proximal to motifs. third, we also discuss the effects of biased gene conversion implicated in this study. then, ldsplit is further validated through simulation studies. at the end, we outline directions for future work.

disrupting effect of snps inside motifs
as introduced in the background section of this paper, the dna binding of prdm <dig> protein regulates the locations and intensities of many recombination hotspots of human and mouse. particularly, the 7-mer dna sequence motif cctccct is at the core of the 13-mer binding motif of prdm <dig> in the human genome  <cit> . thus, this 7-mer motif has the function of stimulating human recombination hotspots, which will be confirmed by ldsplit in this section.

first, we search in the human genome for all occurrences of the 7-mer motif that each contains a snp . we have not observed any case that one occurrence of the 7-mer motif contains more than one snps. in our previous study  <cit>  we focused on the chromosome  <dig> of asian  population from hapmap phase  <dig>  and obtained successful results. instead of repeating our past results, we chose snps in the european population instead and excluded chromosome  <dig> from the hapmap phase  <dig> data. in this way, we collected  <dig> occurrences of the 7-mer motif each containing a snp. second, from the  <dig> snps we selected those snps with maf  at least 30% in the european population, so that ldsplit will not give biased prediction due to small numbers of haplotypes of the minor allele. after this filtering,  <dig> snps inside the 7-mer motif were left, which are proximal to  <dig> recombination hotspots additional file  <dig>  details of the  <dig> snps and their flanking motif occurrences can be find in additional file  <dig> "70_snp_motif_info.xlsx". then, we extended each of the  <dig> selected snps to a flanking window of  <dig> snps , and ran ldsplit on haplotypes of the 101-snp window. from the results of ldsplit on this window, we identified the hotspot h that is located nearest to the candidate snp a . in the following analysis, we will compare the recombination rates of hotspot h between two alleles of the snp a, where one allele preserves the original form of the 7-mer motif, and the other allele disrupts the motif.

based on the estimated recombination rates from ldsplit, we can divide the above  <dig> snps into two categories: one is the positive set in which the snp allele preserving the original form of the 7-mer motif corresponds to a higher estimated recombination rate than the other allele; and the rest snps are in the negative set, i.e. the disrupting allele has the higher recombination rate. as shown in figure  <dig>  the positive set contains  <dig> snps while the negative set contains  <dig> snps. the fact that the positive set is bigger than the negative set indicates that the disruptions to the 7-mer motif by snps indeed correspond to weakened intensities of recombination hotspots, and therefore ld-based analysis provides evidence consistent with the known functional role of the 7-mer motif in stimulating meiotic recombination hotspots. furthermore, snps in the positive set are more enriched  with significant associations  with proximal hotspots than the negative set .therefore, ldsplit supports the association between the 7-mer motif and proximal hotspots.

to further investigate the disrupting effect of snps inside the 7-mer motif on the intensities of proximal hotspots using ld patterns, we compared recombination profiles between two snp alleles as follows. for each of the  <dig> snps, we cut a window of haplotypes flanking the snp as input to ldsplit, which will calculate the two recombination profiles from the subsets of haplotypes corresponding to two alleles of the snp. one allele preserves the original form of the 7-mer motif of cctccct, while the other allele disrupts the motif. then, we aligned the  <dig> pairs of recombination profiles at the centers of the  <dig> proximal hotspots, and calculated the average recombination profiles of the two categories . as shown in figure  <dig>  the disrupting allele indeed has a lower average intensity than the original allele, thereby confirming that the 7-mer motif stimulates meiotic recombination hotspots. in  <cit> , myers and colleagues also plotted a comparison of recombination profiles between two motif forms, but their comparison was between different motif forms and different hotspots along the reference human genome. in contrast, we compared the recombination profiles between two alleles of the same snp and the same hotspot.

motif finding guided by ldsplit
in the previous section, we have shown that ldsplit confirms the 7-mer motif as a cis-regulator element for meiotic recombination hotspots. however, our goal is to use ldsplit to select snps whose positions can guide the discovery of dna sequence motifs. figure  <dig> shows that some snps inside the 7-mer motif may not have significant ldsplit p-values, whereas some snps outside the motif can have significant p-values. in this section, we will demonstrate that, despite false positives and false negatives, ldsplit is able to provide signals that are sufficient for the detection of the 7-mer motif, by narrowing down to the target genomic regions.

from each of the aforementioned  <dig> snps inside the 7-mer motif, we extended to a window of  <dig> snps . then we ran ldsplit on the haplotypes of the snp window to get p-values of snps in the window. from the  <dig> windows, totally  <dig> snps were collected, each of which had a significant ldsplit p-value . given reference dna sequences  and snp physical locations in the reference genome, each of the  <dig> candidate snps was extended to a window of  <dig> dna bases , by cutting the reference sequences flanking the candidate snps. then, we ran the meme program  <cit>   on the  <dig> dna sequences, setting appropriate parameters for meme e.g. ‘one motif occurrence per sequence’ , minimum sites  <dig> and motif length between  <dig> to  <dig>  etc. . for comparison, we also randomly selected snps , and extended them into 101-base dna sequences as input for meme, which was run with the same parameters. to get stable results of comparison, we carried out such random tests for three groups additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> contains dna sequences flanking the snps found by ldsplit to be significantly associated with hotspots, and dna sequences flanking randomly selected snps.

in figure  <dig>  motifs found by meme from the above dna sequences are ranked by their significance scores . the motifs on the left ) are from snps with significant associations with proximal hotspots as selected by ldsplit, and are called positive motifs. from this list, we can see that the top motif in figure  <dig> matches the known 7-mer motif cctccct very closely. the second significant motif in figure  <dig> also closely matches the 7-mer motif, except for an insertion of base g after the third position. by contrast, figure  <dig> shows a group of top random motifs from one of the three groups of snps randomly selected without the guide of ldsplit. clearly, none of the random motifs matches the 7-mer motif closely. therefore, using the 7-mer motif as a benchmark case study, we have shown that ldsplit can narrow down to target genomic regions, as a guide for motif-finding algorithms like meme to discover cis-regulatory dna motifs stimulating meiotic recombination hotspots.

in our method, the input to meme consists of short dna sequences  flanking snps of significant association with hotspots, as detected by ldsplit. by contrast, most existing methods for finding motifs of recombination hotspots use dna sequences under whole hotspots  as input  <cit> . in the following, we compare the two types of methods and show that, by focusing on short dna sequences around snps, ldsplit can improve accuracy of motif finding. we first selected two groups of hotspots from the same genome-wide list of hotspots as previously used . the first group consists of  <dig> hotspots that are the same as we used ldsplit and meme to detect cctccct, the core 7-mer motif of prdm <dig>  the other group of  <dig> hotspots was selected randomly, which may or may not contain the 7-mer motif. the locations and lengths of the hotspots are listed in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> in supplementary materials. then, for each of the two groups, the dna sequences under the hotspots were cut and fed into meme, using the same parameters as we did for ldsplit based motif finding . for each of the two groups, the top  <dig> motifs ranked by significance  were recorded . on the list of motifs from the first group of hotspots , the second motif contains the 6-mer “cctccc” as sub-motif, but none of the other motifs is similar with the 7-mer motif. likewise, from the second group of hotspots, only the third motif and fifth motif contain “cctccc” as sub-motif . therefore, for the 7-mer core motif of prdm <dig>  the accuracy of motif finding using the whole sequences under hotspots is not as good as the motif finding guided by snps selected by ldsplit. one reason could be that dna sequences of whole hotspots are much longer than those around snps, and hence contain various enriched patterns besides the true motifs, which tend to weaken the true signals. nevertheless, the other enriched motifs might also have regulatory functions for recombination hotspots, and need further study.

in the above, we have demonstrated the usefulness of ldsplit for the detection of recombination associated motifs, using the 7-mer core motif of prdm <dig> as an example. several recent papers suggest that prdm <dig> may be responsible for more recombination hotspots in mammalian genomes than previously appreciated  <cit> . however, finding and analysis of dna motifs responsible for meiotic recombination hotspots are still challenging in many situations. even for species in which prdm <dig> is known to determine recombination hotspots, the specific dna motifs may not be clear, due to various reasons such as rapid evolution and extensive diversity of prdm <dig> zinc finger arrays, variation of genetic and epigenetic contexts flanking the binding sites of prdm <dig>  in  <cit> , for example, although a consensus motif was found to be present in at least 73% of mouse hotspots, the consensus motif is not the same as the putative prdm <dig> binding site generated by zifibi database  <cit>  from zinc fingers in the prdm <dig> protein. moreover, for human and mouse, some transcription factor binding sites in addition to the prdm <dig> motif may also regulate recombination hotspots  <cit> . for other species, prdm <dig> is either known to be not functional for hotspots  or a protein with similar functions as prdm <dig> has not been found. sequence based detection of dna motifs would still be important for these species. therefore, for species with or without prdm <dig> determining initiation of recombination hotspots, ldsplit will be useful for understanding dna motifs associated with meiotic recombination. in addition to guiding motif finding, ldsplit can also facilitate detailed visualization and analysis of individual hotspots with specific functions, e.g. immunology related hotspots in the major histocompatibility complex  region.

finding simulated motifs
to evaluate the performance of ldsplit, we conducted a simulation study using a python program based on simupop  <cit> , which we developed earlier  <cit>  to simulate the evolutionary process of a recombination hotspot. a causal snp is inserted as a critical component of the simulation. in each event of meiosis in the simulated evolution, the probability of crossover is determined by the allele of the causal snp . running on simulated snp data, ldsplit detected association of a hotspot with snps with maf ≥  <dig>   and calculated their p-values, in the same way as it does to real hapmap snp data. table  <dig> lists values of key parameters in our simulation experiment. we simulated five populations, and from each population we randomly sampled  <dig> subsets, each consisting of  <dig> individuals . the performance of ldsplit on the  <dig> datasets was consistent with our previous simulation tests  <cit>  .

next, we tested whether the screening of snps by ldsplit can help find causal sequence motifs in the simulated data. from the  <dig> simulated datasets above, we collected totally  <dig> candidate snps with significant ldsplit p-values , each of which was extended to a window of  <dig> dna bases . among the  <dig> dna sequences, we inserted two randomly generated causal motifs “actatcgatctag” and “atgatgtaatggt” in locations where they span the causal snps, thereby modelling the causal effect of the motifs in stimulating meiotic recombination. in case the causal snp is not included in the  <dig> snps due to false negative of ldsplit, the motif is not inserted. then we ran meme on the  <dig> dna sequences to identify motifs, with the same setting of parameters of meme as for finding the 7-mer motif of cctccct. as shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the motifs candidates were ranked by statistical significance, and the top motif candidates found by meme match the causal motifs “actatcgatctag” and “atgatgtaatggt” very closely. this simulation demonstrates that ldsplit is able to screen for genomic loci that are more likely to contain hotspot associated dna sequence motifs.

effect of biased gene conversion
while the idea of ldsplit appears simple, there are subtle caveats because a meiotic recombination hotspot tends to kill itself through biased gene conversion   <cit> . hellenthal et al. <cit>  suggested that, due to bgc, it is likely that an extant hot allele may experience no more crossovers than the cold allele in the history of a population, and therefore it is difficult to detect the allele-specific effect of dna sequence polymorphisms on the intensity of a recombination hotspot from ld patterns. this conclusion was drawn from a mathematical model to estimate the probability that a chromosome with the hot  allele of a snp experienced a crossover in the previous generation, taking into account of bgc. however, their mathematical model also predicted that, when the probability of crossover of a hot allele is say  <dig> times higher than the cold allele, the number of crossover events in the sub-population of the hot allele is about  <dig>  times that of the cold allele in the transmission from the previous generation. this is the case for the dna <dig> hotspot and fg <dig> snp, as reported by sperm typing  <cit> . hence, the mathematical model of hellenthal et al. offers an explanation for the success of ldsplit in predicting the association between the dna <dig> hotspot and fg <dig> snp  <cit> . although the general conclusion in  <cit>  highlighted the difficulty of association studies for recombination hotspots using ld patterns, it does not rule out the effectiveness of ld-based methods like ldsplit, especially for those snps with a big difference in hotspot penetrance between two alleles. indeed, ldsplit has been verified on both real and simulated data, with promising performances. in addition to correctly associate the dna <dig> hotspot with the fg <dig> snp, it identified an 11-mer motif whose complement closely matches the 13-mer binding motif of prdm <dig>  <cit> .

in this paper, we confirmed once gain the prediction of the mathematical model of hellenthal et al. <cit> . as figure  <dig> shows, for  <dig> out of  <dig> snps inside the 7-mer motif cctccct, the disrupting allele, which is supposed to be cold, has higher intensities in proximal hotspots than the “hot” allele that preserves the original motif form. this is probably due to the effect of bgc. meanwhile, the fact that in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases the hot allele still has higher ld-based recombination rate  suggests that the 7-mer motif has a strong stimulating penetrance on proximal recombination hotspots. whereas we did not give any theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of ldsplit in spite of bgc in our previous work  <cit> , here we have made the connection between experimental results and mathematical theory of population genetics. our new experiments and analysis suggest that ldsplit may be more likely to be effective when there is a big difference in hotspot penetrance between two alleles of an associated snp .

future work
since our presentation of ldsplit software in a recent conference  <cit> , several researchers have inquired, downloaded and used ldsplit, showing their interests in this software tool. for broader applications and impacts on the biological research, we plan to further improve ldsplit and continue bioinformatics analysis of recombination hotspots as follows. first, as ldsplit is based on the computation intensive algorithm of ldhat, it is still time consuming for large data sets. thus, we will speed up ldsplit by parallel computing, algorithm optimization, and pre-computing of results on large-scale data . recently we have obtained significant speedup for ldhat algorithm by optimization and parallel computing  <cit> . second, as the biased gene conversion  plays a key role in the success of ldsplit, we will investigate the relation between recombination hotspots and bgc .

one implication of the discovery of prdm <dig> is that epigenetic factors  play important roles in the regulation of recombination hotspots. several recent studies have pointed to this connection  <cit> . recently we have made an effort to integrate genetic and epigenetic factors for regulating meiotic recombination into one predictive model, with promising results  <cit> . an important future work is to incorporate epigenetic factors into the detection of cis-regulatory dna motifs.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we presented ldsplit, an open source software tool for predicting cis-regulatory motifs of meiotic recombination hotspots through snp analysis. with its graphical user interface which allows convenient interactive and integrative analysis of hotspots and associated dna sequences, ldsplit will be a useful tool for many researchers working in areas including  dna recombination, genomic evolution, disease gene mapping, and genome instability. in this paper, we demonstrated the usefulness and accuracy of ldsplit by testing on the 7-mer dna motif of cctccct which is bound to by prdm <dig> and a well-known cis-regulator of recombination hotspots. we showed that snp alleles disrupting the 7-mer motif have lower hotspot intensities estimated by ldsplit. moreover, ldsplit is able to guide the discovery of the 7-mer motif and simulated motifs by the meme software. such a bioinformatics approach is promising for the discovery of cis- and trans-regulators, to uncover the molecular machinery regulating recombination hotspots and genome stability.
