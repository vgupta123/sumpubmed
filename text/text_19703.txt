BACKGROUND
type <dig> diabetes is an immunologically encountered autoimmune disease characterized by specific destruction of beta cells of islets of langerhans residing in pancreas  <cit> . this specific response to beta cells is caused due to immune response against self molecules that behave as non-self . gad  which is involved in synthesis of gamma-amino butyric acid or gaba, a neurotransmitter inhibitor  <cit> , is considered to be one of the strongest candidate auto antigens involved in triggering beta-cell-specific autoimmunity  <cit> . majority of recent type  <dig> diabetes patients and pre-diabetic subjects have anti-gad antibodies in their sera, as do non-obese diabetic  mice, one of the best animal models for human type i diabetes. immunization of young nod mice with gad results in prevention or delay of the disease as a result of tolerizing auto reactive t cells  <cit> . on the other hand over-expression of gad <dig> transgene in animal tissues can exacerbate the disease instead of tolerizing the animal  <cit> . gad usually occurs in two major isoforms; gad <dig> and gad <dig>  encoded by two non-allelic genes located on different chromosomes  <cit>  and are differentially regulated in various mammalian species. in beta cells of human and rat gad <dig> is predominant, while in mouse though both the forms occur gad <dig> predominates over gad <dig>  <cit> . although the expression level of gad <dig> is extremely low in mouse β-islets, it is one of the major islet auto antigens  <cit> . despite studies on the role of gad <dig> in diabetes induction using various in-vitro and in-vivo models of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes  <cit> , the initial islet-specific factor and the molecular mechanisms triggering the aberrant expression of gad <dig> is still not very clear. the smaller form of the gad auto-antigen namely gad <dig>  is a major target of humoral autoimmunity in type- <dig> diabetes. recent data suggest that gad <dig> expression in beta cells varies according to the functional state and the kind of stress  <cit> . high glucose and glutamine have been shown to be putative positive regulators of gad <dig> expression  <cit> , while cytokines like il- <dig> beta have been shown to act as negative regulators  <cit> . gad is an enzyme found in high concentration in the pancreas and brain where it catalyzes the conversion of glutamic acid to gamma-amino butyric acid . gaba is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important in the pancreas as a messenger between neurons and pancreatic cells  <cit> . specific experiments in animal models have shown that gad expression is necessary for the autoimmune destruction of cells. one study in particular, performed on nod mice , incorporated an antisense gad transgene into a subset of mice and found that iddm development was significantly reduced  <cit> .

streptozotocin , derived from a fermentation broth of streptomyces achromogenes, has been widely used to study the beta cell destruction both in-vitro and in-vivo models  <cit> . the drug streptozotocin  is a glucose analogue  that is rapidly transported into the β-cells via the glucose transporter, glut <dig>  <cit>  and is known to be metabolized readily upon entry into the cell. the exact mechanism of stz’s toxicity is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that its primary effect on beta cells is dna damage by alkylation, unscheduled dna synthesis, dna adducts, chromosomal aberrations and dna strand breaks induced by free radical generation  <cit> .

the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> can cause cell cycle arrest upon dna damage induced activation  <cit> . in doing so, it facilitates the repair of damaged dna or eliminates irreversibly damaged or abnormally growing cells to prevent potential transformation. mdm <dig> helps to maintain steady state levels of p <dig> under normal condition through ubiquitination pathway  <cit> . stz has also been shown to induce p <dig> protein in min <dig> cells  <cit>  but the exact mechanism is largely unknown. one study also reported p <dig> antibodies circulating in patients suffering from type- <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

gene regulation is one of the most complex processes involving cross talk between a variety of proteins, nuclear matrix, dna and many other dna binding factors. the function of nuclear matrix is to provide a solid platform for efficient transcription. a number of matrix associated dna region binding proteins  are known to be involved in regulation of transcription. smar <dig> is one such marbp which was earlier shown to be involved in the regulation of cyclin d <dig> and ck <dig> expression  <cit> . smar <dig> specifically binds to putative mar  of the transcriptional enhancer  at the t-cell receptor-β locus  <cit> . this protein is known to cause cell cycle arrest and activates p <dig> through its serine  <dig> phosphorylation as well as through disruption of its interaction with mdm <dig>  <cit> . it is a potent tumor suppressor protein and significantly downregulated in higher grades of breast cancer  <cit> .

the present study delineates a novel mechanism of regulation of gad <dig> expression by two tumor suppressor proteins, smar <dig> and p <dig>  we show that both the proteins can individually and synergistically upregulate gad <dig> expression. we demonstrate that smar <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter in vitro and in-vivo to upregulate its mrna expression. our results show that stz treatment leads to upregulation of smar <dig> and p <dig> expression. on the other hand mdm <dig> expression is downregulated leading to increased stability of p <dig>  the stabilized p <dig> in turn binds to smar <dig> leading to an increased expression of gad <dig>  we also show a temporal increase of smar <dig> and p <dig> proteins on gad <dig> promoter upon stz treatment. further studies using mouse β-islets confirmed our findings regarding the synergy between p <dig> and smar <dig> in gad <dig> expression. taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of regulation of major auto antigen gad <dig> by smar <dig> and p <dig> 

RESULTS
smar <dig> binds to multiple dna sequences in genome
smar <dig> is documented to be a transcriptional activator/repressor in a context dependent manner, based on its dna binding abilities. in vivo, smar <dig> binds to the promoters of cyclin d <dig> and 5' utr of cytokeratin  <dig>  <cit> . to gain a better understanding of the transcription regulatory activities of smar <dig>  we wanted to delineate various genomic dna sequences bound by smar <dig>  therefore, we resorted to a novel pull down assay. briefly, mouse genomic dna was sheared to obtain small fragments of approximately 500 bp. these fragments were incubated with glutathione bead bound gst-smar <dig> recombinant protein and the bound dna fragments were subsequently sequenced. glutathione beads as well as bead bound gst were the controls used to negate non- specific binders. the resulting fragments were sequenced and then aligned using meme software and a  <dig> mer consensus was derived . further manual alignments of the derived sequences lead to identification of a hexamer  consensus smar <dig> binding sequences where first four nucleotides are conserved while fifth one can be either pyrimidine or purine and the last nucleotide is either of the purines . further, we were able to validate our method by identification of some of the already known promoters bound by smar <dig>  including cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , bax  <cit> , 5' utr of cytokeratin  <dig>  <cit> . one of the unique promoters found to be bound by smar <dig> was gad <dig> while the other isoform of gad i.e. gad <dig> promoter did not show any binding. in order to confirm that smar <dig> indeed binds to the gad <dig> promoter, we performed cnbr pull down assay. the consensus sequence from gad <dig> promoter and the general consensus oligonucleotide were individually coupled to cnbr beads and rin 5f cell lysate was passed through the column. the protein samples were eluted from the cnbr columns and processed for western blotting using smar <dig> specific antibody. our result showed that smar <dig> bound with equal propensity to both gad <dig> promoter sequence and the general consensus oligo . in-vitro pull down assays followed by pcr amplification showed that gst-p <dig>  350– <dig> aa  and the full-length smar <dig> were able to precipitate gad <dig> promoter . the protein binding domain of smar <dig> i.e. gst-smar <dig> , gst bound beads and glutathione beads alone did not show any amplification  showing the specificity of the interaction. all these samples were further analyzed for gad <dig> promoter binding. while we detected gad <dig> promoter bound to gst-p <dig>  neither the full length nor the dna binding domain of smar <dig> showed any binding to gad <dig> promoter . it is well known that p <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter  <cit> . from the above mentioned results, it is clear that smar <dig> specifically binds to the consensus sequence in gad <dig> promoter.

gad <dig> has a tata less promoter and various other factors are known to regulate it. therefore we analyzed gad <dig> promoter for other transcription factor binding sites in silico. a careful analysis of the sequence showed that smar <dig> binds 870 bp upstream of transcription start site. we found a strong p <dig> consensus element  and a p <dig> binding site  juxtaposed to smar <dig> binding sites. a detailed map of various binding sites is shown in additional file  <dig> 

smar <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter and upregulates its expression
we further verified the binding of smar <dig> to gad <dig> promoter using mobility shift assays. a 120 bp probe from gad <dig> promoter which harbors the potential mar and smar <dig> consensus binding site was radiolabelled and used for the assays. emsa using radiolabelled gad <dig> promoter probe showed a smar1-dna complex formation  and a cold competitor reduced this complex formation  showing the specificity of binding. gad <dig> and actin  promoter specific probes did not show any complex formation with smar <dig> recombinant protein. also, competition with cyclin d <dig> promoter oligo, greatly reduced the complex formation on gad <dig> oligo and reflected the specificity of the complex formation . similarly, super-shift assays with smar <dig> specific antibody on using rin cell lysate helped document smar <dig> complex formation on gad <dig> promoter oligo . the use of cold competitor in this experiment significantly reduced the specific complex formation .

after confirming that smar <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter, we proceeded to check the in vivo effect of smar <dig> binding on the promoter. it is known that gad <dig> is the predominant form in rat while in mouse both the forms are expressed. rat insuloma cell line rin 5f cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by gad <dig> promoter, and expression plasmids/sirnas of smar <dig> and p <dig>  the results show that gad <dig> promoter drives the expression of reporter gene upon over-expression of smar <dig> or p <dig> witnessed by an increase of ~  <dig> and ~  <dig>  folds respectively . on the other hand, knock-down of either of these proteins leads to a decreased luciferase activity driven by gad <dig> promoter. over-expression of smar <dig> and p <dig> together lead to the highest luciferase counts  indicating their additive effect on gad <dig> promoter. on the other hand the knockdown of both lead to negligible promoter activity. knock-down of p <dig> and over expression of smar <dig> partially rescued  the luciferase activity. these results indicate that although smar <dig> or p <dig> individually can up-regulate gad <dig> promoter activity, their synergistic activity is required for maximal promoter activity that in turn reflects the transcriptional activation. on the other hand, either one of them is indispensible for activation of gad <dig> promoter. it has been reported that phosphorylation of smar <dig> at serine  <dig> residue reduces its dna binding activity . transfection of s370a mutant-smar <dig> led to a reduced gad <dig> promoter activity compared to the wild-type smar <dig>  this was not overcome by ectopic expression of p <dig> . this result clearly indicates that direct binding of smar <dig> is essential for gad <dig> promoter activation and that the effect of smar <dig> is not through stabilization/activation of p <dig>  in order to verify our results we performed western blot analysis to confirm over expression as well as sirna mediated knockdown of smar <dig> and p <dig>  figure 2f shows the expression levels of smar <dig>  as well as p <dig>  in rin5f cells.

smar <dig> leads to upregulation of gad <dig> expression
next we verified the expression of gad <dig> upon over expression of smar <dig>  rt-pcr results showed that upon smar <dig> over expression, gad <dig> and p <dig> mrna levels are elevated in a dose dependent manner . densitometric analysis of the rt-pcr showed that upon transfection of 2 μg of smar <dig>  gad <dig> mrna levels were  <dig> folds higher compared to the control cells, while p <dig> mrna levels were increased by  <dig> folds . similarly, western blot analysis of the same showed increased gad <dig> protein levels in a dose dependent over-expression of smar <dig>  earlier it has been reported that smar <dig> leads to phosphorylation of p <dig> at serine  <dig> and subsequent stabilization  <cit> . we also observed increased serine  <dig> phosphorylation as well as total p <dig> levels . actin was used as loading control. also, our results showed that over expression of either of smar <dig> or p <dig> lead to elevated gad <dig> protein levels while their knockdown decreased gad <dig> expression . we then transfected different truncations of smar <dig> pertaining to dna binding  and protein interacting domain  of smar <dig> along with the full length smar <dig>  our results showed that full length as well as dna binding domain of smar <dig> lead to increased expression of gad <dig> . thus, our results show that dna binding activity of smar <dig> is necessary for upregulation of gad <dig> expression, while the protein interacting domain which has been shown to phosphorylate and activate p <dig> is not sufficient to drive p <dig> dependent expression of gad <dig> 

stz induced dna damage leads to upregulation of gad <dig>  smar <dig> and p53
it is known that gad <dig> and p <dig> expression increases upon stz treatment  <cit> , which prompted us to verify the effect of stz on smar <dig>  as reported earlier, smar <dig> is a dna damage responsive protein and is upregulated upon dna damage induced by h2o <dig>  γ-irradiation, camptothecin and doxorubicin. our results here show that stz treatment to rin cells led to elevated mrna levels of smar <dig>  p <dig> and gad <dig> in a dose dependent manner . western blotting of the same showed that smar <dig>  p <dig> and gad <dig> protein levels were elevated upon 4 mm stz treatment. interestingly serine  <dig> as well as ser  <dig> phosphorylation of p <dig> also increases, indicating that prolonged stz treatment leads to apoptosis through serine  <dig> phosphorylation of p <dig> . facs analysis of the cells also showed increased number of apoptotic cells upon stz treatment . therefore, we examined the kinetics of smar <dig> and p <dig> binding to gad <dig> promoter upon stz treatment. rin cells were treated with stz for indicated time points and processed for chip analysis. our results show that there is increased binding of smar <dig> as well as p <dig> on gad <dig> promoter in a time dependent manner upon stz treatment . histones on gad <dig> promoter were hyper-acetylated in response to stz treatment showing chromatin activation. the increase in recruitment of p <dig> to gad <dig> promoter indicates chromatin activation that is reflected in increased gad <dig> expression. on the other hand hdac <dig> as well as me3h4k <dig> showed time dependent loss of binding to gad <dig> promoter . hdac <dig> recruitment causes local deacetylation of the chromatin thus leading to repressed state. tri methylation of histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> residue is also indicative of the compact/repressed state of chromatin. all these results indicate that upon stz treatment, smar <dig> and p <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter and recruit p <dig> which then leads to activation of gad <dig> promoter. upstream promoter region of gad <dig> and actin promoter served as negative controls .

effect of stz treatment on mouse β-islets
after verifying that smar <dig> leads to increased expression of gad <dig> upon stz induced dna damage, we wanted to verify our results in-vivo. mouse β-islets were isolated using collagen as detailed in materials and methods section and were cultured for 6 hrs prior to treatment. the islets were then treated with high  and low  dose of glucose, p <dig> activity inhibitor pifithrin-α pft and stz  for 24 hrs followed by confocal as well as rt-pcr analysis. confocal results showed that stz treatment leads to increased expression of smar <dig>  p <dig> as well as gad <dig> . phosphorylation of smar <dig> at serine  <dig> residue is also increased upon stz treatment . this post-translationally modified form of smar <dig> is known to have higher affinity for dna  <cit> . on the other hand the islets treated with pft along with stz did not show much change in gad <dig> expression indicating that p <dig> is required for its higher expression.

rt-pcr in the islets showed that treatment with high glucose or stz lead to increased expression of smar <dig>  gad <dig> and p <dig>  while mdm <dig> mrna levels are reduced . actin was used as loading control. on the other hand, islets treated with both p <dig> inhibitor pft and stz showed only a marginal increase in gad <dig> expression indicating that although smar <dig> alone can up-regulate the gad <dig> expression, the combinatorial effect of smar <dig> and p <dig> is needed for sustained levels of gad <dig> . the densitometric analysis of rt-pcr shows that upon stz treatment, p <dig>  smar <dig> and gad <dig> mrna levels increase by ~ <dig> ; ~ <dig>  & ~ <dig>  folds respectively . this increased gad <dig> is secreted in the circulation and is considered as the first injury marker for β-islet injury  <cit> .

discussion
transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression through their dna binding properties. in order to understand the different functions of a transcription factor, elucidation of its target genes is of utmost importance. as discussed earlier, smar <dig> is a transcription factor and is involved in various cellular pathways through regulation of target gene expression like cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , ck <dig>  <cit>  and bax  <cit> . in order to further delineate various promoters bound by smar <dig>  we employed a novel in vitro binding assay using recombinant gst-smar <dig> protein. our protocol involved in vitro binding of recombinant protein with sonicated mouse genomic dna fragments. the high salt buffer maintains a stringent condition for protein-dna interaction. subsequent cloning and sequencing of pulled dna fragments lead to validation of known smar <dig> target promoters as well as elucidation of many new promoter fragments, gad <dig> being one of them. the interesting aspect of this interaction was that smar <dig> was specifically binding to only gad <dig> and not to the promoter of other isoform gad <dig>  since gad <dig> is a crucial protein in the induction of diabetes, we investigated the mechanism of its regulation by smar <dig>  the major phenotype in type- <dig> diabetes is apoptosis, resulting in a progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells through autoimmune attack. on the other hand it has been shown that over-expression of gad <dig> transgene in animal tissues can exacerbate the disease instead of tolerizing the animal though the exact mechanism remains unclear  <cit> . another study using fetal mouse tissue, showed upregulation of gad in pancreatic islet cells. this upregulation was shown to be caused by an impairment of mitochondrial complex i as a result of iddm. impairment of mitochondria resulted in an accumulation of glutamate that directly induced the upregulation of gad in the cells  <cit> . it is speculated that gad expression on pancreatic beta cells may be involved in the modulation of beta cell specific autoimmune response and/or modulation of the functional state of beta cell  <cit> . much of the accumulated data from type- <dig> animal models has come from the discovery of a novel diabetogenic compound streptozotocin . the influence of stz on the modulation of gad expression has been shown earlier on gad <dig> in min cells and also the ins cells treated with stz show increased release of gaba in the culture medium that indirectly measures the rate of gad expression  <cit> . several key transcriptional factors like nfκb and p <dig> have been shown to regulate the expression of gad. although it has been shown that stz can regulate gad <dig> but its effect on gad <dig> expression has not been precisely evaluated  <cit> .

in the present study we for the first time show that smar <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter but not gad <dig>  using a novel in-vitro pull down assay we derived a consensus dna binding site for smar <dig>  bioinformatics analysis of various known smar <dig> binding sequences revealed that there is significant similarity between dna sequences where smar <dig> binds. for example, cyclin d <dig> and gad <dig> share the identical hexamer sequence in their promoter where smar <dig> binds. cnbr pull down assay followed by western blotting  confirmed that smar <dig> binds to the consensus as well as gad <dig> promoter. binding of smar <dig> to gad <dig> promoter was further verified using emsa. our results suggest that smar <dig> and p <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter and synergistically regulate its expression. transient transfections of smar <dig> or p <dig> followed by rt-pcr as well as luciferase assays showed that smar <dig> as well as p <dig> individually can up-regulate gad <dig> expression. on the other hand whenever transfected together, the gad <dig> expression increased many fold, indicating that both smar <dig> and p <dig> act cumulatively leading to an increased expression of gad <dig>  our results indicate that dna binding domain binds to gad <dig> promoter while protein interacting domain might recruit various other transcription factors leading to upregulation of gad <dig> promoter.

in our model also we have investigated the possible role of stz in modulation of gad <dig> expression through co-ordinated interaction of p <dig> and smar <dig>  we first examined the effect of stz on the expression of gad <dig>  p <dig> and smar <dig> in rat beta cell line, rinm5f. we found that stz significantly enhanced the expression of p <dig>  smar <dig> and gad <dig> molecules both at mrna and protein level. this increased expression was observed in a time and dose dependent manner stz treatment also led to increased phosphorylation of p <dig> at serine  <dig> as well as serine  <dig>  serine  <dig> phosphorylation of p <dig> indicates the activation of p <dig> while phosphorylation at serine  <dig> phosphorylation generally leads to apoptosis. facs analysis also showed increased amount of apoptosis 36 h post stz treatment. collectively, our results showed that stz treatment leads to upregulation of gad <dig> expression ultimately leading to apoptosis. we further wanted to see the kinetics of binding of smar <dig> and p <dig> to gad <dig> promoter upon stz treatment. chip analysis showed that there is a time dependent increase in association of smar <dig> and p <dig> on gad <dig> promoter. markers for chromatin activation ach3k <dig> also showed increased amplification. the increase in recruitment of p <dig> to gad <dig> promoter indicates chromatin activation that is reflected in increased gad <dig> expression. on the other hand hdac <dig> as well as me3h4k <dig> showed time dependent loss of binding to gad <dig> promoter. all these results indicate that upon stz treatment, smar <dig> and p <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter and recruits p <dig> which leads to activation of gad <dig> promoter. we further verified our results using mouse β-islets. our results showed that stz mediated upregulation of gad <dig> expression is dependent on conflated action of p <dig> and smar <dig> 

interestingly, the analysis of promoter sequences of gad <dig> across species from human, mouse, rat and found that smar <dig> bound sequence is rather conserved amongst these species. further alignment of mouse gad <dig> promoter sequences with guinea pig, monkey, bos taraus and chimpanzee genomes showed that there is a great degree of conservation amongst all these species. the detailed alignment study is described in additional file  <dig> 

thus our study for the first time shows the involvement of a mar binding protein smar <dig> in regulation of gad <dig> expression. p <dig> is already known to bind to and regulate expression of gad <dig> isoform of gad. in the present study we show that p <dig> also regulates expression of gad <dig>  upon stz treatment smar <dig> and p <dig> leads to upregulation of gad <dig> expression which may be secreted in the blood. this circulating gad <dig> is considered as an early marker for β-cell injury  <cit> . taken together, our results show that gad <dig> acts as one of the major injury marker as well as immuno-modulator. thus regulation of gad <dig> expression in β-islets by smar <dig> and p <dig> presents another facet of their involvement in dna damage response.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study delineates yet another facet of regulation of gad <dig> expression by two tumor suppressor proteins smar <dig> and p <dig> synergistically. the study describes a novel pull down assay as a method to build library of dna fragments bound to a protein in-vitro. by employing various techniques like chip, south western assays to study kinetics of dna-protein interactions, we show that smar <dig> and p <dig> binds to gad <dig> promoter in close vicinity to each other and upregulate gad <dig> expression in a time and dose dependent manner upon stz treatment. induction of stress to β-islets by streptozotocin causing activates p <dig> and smar <dig> which inturn bind to gad <dig> promoter and upregulating its expression. this increased production of gad <dig> protein may be secreted in blood and detected as injury/stress marker to β-islets during onset of diabetes.
