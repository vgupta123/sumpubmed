BACKGROUND
cotton seed fibers are single-celled trichomes that initiate from the ovule epidermal cells on or about the day of anthesis   <cit> . approximately 25% of the ovule epidermal cells differentiate into fiber cells during the initiation stage of cotton fiber development and subsequently undergo a period of rapid elongation known as the elongation stage  <cit> . the rate of fiber elongation peaks at approximately  <dig> to  <dig> days post-anthesis  and nears cessation around  <dig> dpa  <cit> . during peak elongation fiber cells can increase in length at rates of  <dig> mm / day or more depending on environmental factors and genotypes  <cit> . beginning at 12– <dig> dpa and overlapping with the elongation phase is the secondary cell wall  biosynthesis stage. during this stage cellulose is synthesized and deposited between the primary cell wall and the plasmalemma  <cit> . the period of overlap between the elongation stage and the initial stage of scw biosynthesis is referred as the transition period. elongation and scw biosynthesis continue until the fibers reach full length   <cit> , after which the cotton bolls open and the fibers desiccate under exposure to the environment. the environmental and genetic factors that influence the timing of these processes have been shown to also influence the development of desirable fiber traits such as lint yield and fiber quality  <cit> .

several naturally occurred cotton mutations affecting a range of fiber phenotypes have been genetically and functionally characterized in cotton. examples include the completely glabrous seeds  observed in md <dig>  <cit> , the fuzzless/lintless  mutant of xz- <dig>  <cit> , and lines with seeds containing only lint and no fuzz, such as the naked seed lines n <dig> and n <dig> <cit> . mutant lines exhibiting very short seed fibers include the ligon lintless- <dig> and − <dig> lines   <cit> . recently, cai et al.  <cit>  analyzed a man-made mutant lix that showed similar phenotype to li <dig>  the understanding that initiation, elongation, and secondary cell wall synthesis are distinct developmental processes often leads to the utilization of the applicable mutant to study the specific process of interest. for example, fl mutant seeds lacking any fiber emergence have served as models for studying initiation processes where enrichment of the homeodomain–leucine zipper transcription factor  and ghmyb <dig> were identified as important for initiation  <cit> . likewise, n <dig>  with its lack of fuzz fiber and sparsely-distributed lint fibers has been used to characterize fiber elongation processes  <cit> .

in a near-isogenic state with the cotton line texas marker- <dig> , both the li <dig> and li <dig> mutants have seed fibers that are extremely short  compared to wild type  fibers that are typically greater than  <dig> mm in length  <cit> . as a monogenic dominant trait, the short-fiber phenotypes of li <dig> and li <dig> are identical in either a homozygous dominant or heterozygous state. unlike the li <dig> mutant which appears healthy and morphologically identical to the homozygous recessive wild-type plants with the exception of shorter seed fibers, the li <dig> mutant exhibits pleiotropy in the form of severely stunted and deformed plants in both the homozygous dominant and heterozygous state  <cit> .

since the seed fibers of li <dig> and li <dig> fibers are shortened lint and fuzz fibers, these cotton mutants represent excellent candidates to study the molecular mechanisms of fiber elongation. previously, our laboratory conducted extensive analysis of the li <dig> mutant using microarray technology, molecular mapping and metabolomic analysis  <cit> . we developed microsatellite markers associated with the li <dig> genetic locus, and identified transcripts or genes and metabolites that were affected by the li <dig> mutation. in order to gain more comprehensive knowledge about cotton fiber development, and especially fiber elongation, we included the li <dig> mutant as a subject of our investigation.

the li <dig> mutant has been used as a model to study both primary and secondary cell wall processes  <cit> . however, previous microarray experiments with the li <dig> mutant conducted during either very early elongation or later scw stage failed to identify significant numbers of differentially expressed transcripts. for example, the microarray experiments conducted by bolten et al. <cit>  using  <dig> dpa fibers only identified ~ <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, notable among them susy, expansins, and myb transcription factors. however, apparent phenotypic differences in the li <dig> as early as  <dig> dpa  <cit>  indicating that altered gene expression may exist at or before this stage. noting this, a microarray experiment conducted by liu et al.  <cit>  analyzed the li <dig> mutant at the initiation and elongation stages of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa. their findings concurred with several earlier studies on the relevance of auxin, gibberellins, brassinosteroid and ethylene-related pathways in fiber development. elongation stage  fibers from li <dig> demonstrated a significant alteration in transcript profiles, with  <dig>  target sequences showing altered expression in the mutant. despite this, a crucial gap remains in our understanding of how the li <dig> mutation affects the transcript profile at the transition period . this paper is the first attempt to analyze gene expression patterns in the li <dig> mutant using microarray technology at these critical developmental stages. here we provide a more complete picture of the molecular events directly controlling fiber elongation. further, it will better define the mutation in terms of its effects on primary cell wall elongation and early secondary cell wall synthesis.

prior research has determined that the li <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> using both ssr  <cit>  and rflp markers  <cit> . karaca et al.  <cit>  identified the ssr marker mp <dig> that was  <dig>  cm away from the li <dig> locus. rong et al.  <cit>  provided the highest resolution to date, determining li <dig> was flanked by rflp markers gate4ca <dig> and coau1j <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm away, respectively, based on  <dig> f <dig> progeny derived from an interspecific cross of g. barbadense pima s-7 × li <dig> mutant.

in order to conduct a comprehensive study of the li <dig> mutant, we first created near-isogenic lines  in dp <dig> genetic background by implementing an extensive backcross scheme. the use of dp <dig>  a modern variety, exhibits stronger growth characteristics than tm- <dig> in many climates and permits for additional analysis with the previously characterized ligon lintless- <dig> , which is also in the dp <dig> background  <cit> . using the two nils as parents, we made a very large f <dig> population comprising  <dig>  progeny which was used to identify molecular markers closely associated with the li <dig> locus. to understand the molecular events that control fiber elongation and identify regulatory elements involved in this process, we obtained transcript profiles at  <dig> dpa ,  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa  using affymetrix microarrays, and analyzed morphological characteristics of fibers from the li <dig> nils at different developmental stages. the objectives of this research were to determine the location of the li <dig> locus on the chromosome, and identify genes that were differentially expressed during the development of wt and mutant li <dig> fibers. this information will, in turn, be useful to identify the li <dig> gene, and help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this gene on fiber elongation.

methods
plant materials for microarray and quantitative pcr  experiments
two near-isogenic lines of li <dig> upland cottons  that were homozygous dominant  and homozygous recessive  for the li <dig> locus were developed in a backcross program at stoneville, ms in field and greenhouse environments . texas marker- <dig>  cotton plants containing the li <dig> gene were crossed with the upland cotton variety dp <dig>  f <dig> progeny were backcrossed for five generations  by single seed decent  to dp <dig> which served as the recurrent parent in each backcross. at the end of bc <dig> cycle, plants with li <dig> phenotype were self-pollinated. the dp <dig> recurrent parent was a pure inbred line that was self-pollinated for nine generations via ssd . progenies in each backcross were selected based on the phenotype for the li <dig> short-fiber mutation.

for the microarray and qpcr experiments, a total of  <dig> homozygous  li <dig> mutant and  <dig> wt  plants were planted in a field at the southern regional research center, new orleans, la in the summers of  <dig> and  <dig>  the soil type in new orleans was aquent dredged over alluvium in an elevated location to provide adequate drainage. flowers were tagged and sample collections were made before 10: <dig> am and immediately placed on ice. all samples collected within each developmental stage were tagged and collected on the same day. fruits were randomly grouped into  <dig> individual replicates with 5– <dig> fruits per replicate. fruits were then dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°c until further processing.

mapping population
a wt dp <dig>  was used as the female in a cross with its near-isogenic mutant line . two thousand five hundred fifty-three f <dig> plants derived from approximately  <dig> f <dig> plants were planted along with their parents in a field in stoneville, ms in  <dig>  the li <dig> trait of each f <dig> progeny plant was evaluated after boll maturation and opening . standard conventional field practices were applied during the growing season. the soil type in stoneville, ms was bosket very fine sandy loam.

fiber length and cellulose content measurements
fiber length was measured using the method described by schubert et al.  <cit> . two replicate samples with  <dig> ovules each were measured. for mass determination, air-dried fibers were gently removed from all ovules of each sample, and weighted on an analytical balance. cellulose content from each fiber sample was measured using the method described by updegraff  <cit>  with minor modification. dried fiber samples were cut into small pieces. ten mg of the blended fibers were placed in  <dig> ml reacti-vials™ . non-cellulosic materials in fibers were hydrolyzed with acetic-nitric reagent. the remaining cellulose was hydrolyzed with sulfuric acid and measured by a colorimetric assay with anthrone using avicel ph- <dig>  as a cellulose standard. the average cellulose content for each fiber sample was obtained from two biological and three technical replications.

imaging analysis of fiber cross-sections
fibers from  <dig> and  <dig> dpa were manually separated from the seed. after bundling the fibers together, a new razor blade was used to cut  <dig>  –  <dig> mm of fiber from the end to be sectioned. this ensured a majority of fibers were cross-sectioned near the middle of the fiber. the fiber samples were embedded, thin-section cut, and photographed using the method previously described  <cit> . the images were taken using a nikon cambridge quantimet  <dig> microscope at 200× magnification with a hitachi kp-dso camera.

rna isolation from cotton fibers
rna was isolated as previously described  <cit> . briefly, material was obtained from developing ovules using a glass bead shearing technique  <cit> . to separate the fibers from the ovules the samples were shaken vigorously enough to break fibers without damaging the ovules. isolation of rna was conducted using the sigma spectrum™ plant total rna kit  with on-column dnasei digestion according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna quantity was determined by using a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . a rna integrity number  was determined for each sample using an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> and the rna  <dig> nano kit chip . only samples with rin values of  <dig>  or higher were used for further analysis.

microarray hybridizations and data analysis
the minimum information about microarray experiments  guidelines were followed for all microarray experiments conducted in this study  <cit> . the microarray chips used for this study were the commercially available affymetrix genechip® cotton genome microarray , comprising  <dig>  probe sets representing  <dig>  cotton transcripts from a variety of est databases. labeling of the rna was conducted using the affymetrix genechip® 3′ ivt express kit and hybridizations were conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocols. hybridizations were conducted on  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa samples with two biological replicates from each developmental stage. data normalization and the determination of statistically relevant deviations in expression patterns were performed as described  <cit> . to assist in analysis of biological processes represented in the data, gene-ontology enrichment analysis  was performed using the agrigo singular enrichment analysis tool  <cit> . the statistical test method used was the fisher’s exact test . annotation of the probe sets was accomplished with blast2go  <cit> , and analysis of the cellulose synthase probes was conducted by translating all  <dig> reading frames of the probe sets and subjecting them to blastp analysis.

to investigate the activity of known cell elongation and cell wall-related genes, the microarray probe sets were compared with published lists of genes  <cit> . each probe set reference sequence was aligned to the g. raimondii reference genome  <cit>  with blastn and the best hit with e value of 1×10- <dig> or smaller was used to establish an annotation. the g. raimondii gene annotations specify an arabidopsis homolog for each gene, which was used to classify the functions of each affymetrix probe set. seventy-four probe sets were classified as elongation genes based on an earlier report  <cit> . to classify probe sets as primary or secondary cell wall genes, co-expression with arabidopsis microarray data with known primary or secondary cell wall cellulose synthase genes  <cit>  was obtained from attedii  <cit> . this strategy produced lists of  <dig> primary cell wall and  <dig> secondary cell wall gene probe sets.

reverse transcription and quantitative pcr
the cdna reactions were performed using the iscript™ cdna synthesis kit  per the manufacturer’s instructions. the reaction without reverse transcriptase served as negative control for testing genomic dna contamination of the rna samples. this reaction was then used as template in a qpcr reaction to verify that no amplification occurred. after cdna synthesis, the qpcr reaction was conducted using itaq™ sybr® green supermix  in a bio-rad cfx <dig> real time pcr detection system. pcr conditions and the protocols for determining primer efficiencies were as previously described  <cit> . ubiquitin-conjugated protein   was used as the endogenous reference gene. primer sequences are listed in additional file  <dig> 

ssr marker analysis and genetic mapping
young leaves were collected from each individual f <dig> plant and parents, and stored at −80°c. total dna was extracted from frozen leaves according to fang et al.  <cit> . the li <dig> gene was previously determined to reside on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . to rapidly identify molecular markers closely linked to the li <dig> locus, all simple sequence repeat  markers that were mapped on both chr. <dig> and its homeologous chr.  <dig> based on the high density consensus genetic map  <cit>  were selected for analysis. rflp markers reported by rong et al.  <cit>  were not screened due to unavailability of probes, and technical difficulties for rflp marker analysis. the ssr markers mapped on chr.  <dig> and its homeologous chr. <dig> were also included because of a known translocation between chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig>  <cit> . all together, a total of  <dig> ssr markers mapped in these four chromosomes were screened for polymorphism between dna bulks. for the wt bulk, dna of  <dig> f <dig> plants with wt phenotype were pooled at equal ratio and diluted to 50ng/μl. the mutant type bulk consisted of dna from  <dig> f <dig> plants with short seed fiber. four dna bulks were made, two for each type. the polymorphic markers were then analyzed using  <dig> f <dig> progeny to identify markers closely associated with the li <dig> locus. only ssr markers that revealed less than  <dig> recombination events were analyzed among the total  <dig>  f <dig> progeny plants.the pcr amplification conditions and marker data acquisition were according to fang et al.  <cit> . all ssr primer sequences can be obtained from cotton marker database . segregation data for the li <dig> trait and ssr markers were mapped using program joinmap <dig>   <cit>  with logarithm of odds score = <dig> 

functional analysis of the li <dig> region
to obtain sequences in the region determined to contain the li <dig> mutant gene, the identified ssr marker sequences were aligned to the diploid g. raimondii d <dig> genome  <cit> . we also blasted other ssr marker sequences from the li <dig> interval of chr.  <dig> based on the high density consensus map  <cit> . this permitted comparison of the gene annotations for this interval with the annotations provided by affymetrix to identify candidate genes. qpcr on select genes was conducted as described above.

sequencing introns to develop additional polymorphic markers
to identify additional polymorphisms that could facilitate finer mapping of the li <dig> locus, we sequenced introns from the annotated genes in the  <dig> mb interval between the markers tmb <dig> and dpl <dig> according to the reference g. raimondii genome sequences. our rational to sequence introns was that introns tend to have higher sequence variations than exons. we designed primers that flanked  <dig> introns but were anchored in protein coding sequences. three genes that resided in this interval and showed differential expression between wt and mutant were included. amplicons were generated from total genomic dnas of the parental lines and two f <dig> individuals  and were sanger sequenced.

RESULTS
fiber structure analysis
early literature indicated that the li <dig> mutant in a tm- <dig> genetic background demonstrated a reduced rate of crystalline cellulose deposition during primary cell wall synthesis and an increased rate during scw synthesis, resulting in a “thickened” appearance of the cell wall in the mutant  <cit> . however, it remains unclear if this effect is due primarily to the mutation causing inhibition of fiber elongation processes or due to the mutation affecting scw synthesis processes such as cellulose deposition, or both. to better characterize phenotypic changes in the mutant during late elongation and secondary cell wall deposition, changes in fiber length, mass, density, and cellulose content over developmental times were measured. grown in standard field conditions in new orleans, la, the homozygous li <dig> mutant demonstrated a characteristic short fiber phenotype and other previously characterized pleiotropic characteristics . heterozygous individuals derived from dp <dig> x li1li <dig> crosses demonstrated a dosage effect resulting in an intermediate plant size . measurements of fiber physical properties indicated that li <dig> mutants had a dramatic difference in both length and fiber dry weight  at the developmental stages measured  as compared to the wt. elongation ceased or remained static in the li <dig> mutant by  <dig> dpa, however fiber dry weight continued to increase during scw synthesis and through to maturity, likely due to the continued deposition of cellulose. calculating fiber density further illustrated the continued increase in biomass observed over the developmental stages and a much higher density in comparison to the wt. however, the overall cellulose content per unit mass was similar between wt and the li <dig> mutant in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> dpa and mature fibers. image analysis indicated the li <dig> mutant fibers at  <dig> dpa, , were in general “thicker” than wt fibers , which corroborated our observations on the increasing mass of the fibers. combined, these results suggested that while thickening of the secondary cell wall occurred through developmental stages, it was not due to a relative increase in overall cellulose content or rate of production per fiber cell in the li <dig> mutant. rather, due to early cessation of fiber elongation, the stunted fiber did not distribute the cellulose along its longitudinal axis, thus resulting in a thickened appearance, and an increased mass per unit length.

microarray analysis
all three developmental time points analyzed demonstrated alterations in gene expression in the li <dig> mutant. at  <dig> dpa the effects of the mutation were relatively limited, showing only a total of  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated . of importance,  <dig> of these probe sets were unique to  <dig> dpa and were not differentially expressed at  <dig> or  <dig> dpa . at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed, respectively. to analyze which developmental processes were affected in the li <dig> mutant, target sequences previously identified as elongation, primary cell wall synthesis, or secondary cell wall synthesis were tabulated in each of the experimental categories. figure 2b illustrates that more than a quarter of primary cell wall genes were down-regulated in the li <dig> mutant at  <dig> dpa, as were a third of secondary cell wall biosynthesis genes at  <dig> dpa. very few cell wall-related probe sets were up or down-regulated at  <dig> dpa . this analysis revealed that while the li <dig> mutation affected transcriptional activity at all stages of development, a major effect was the inhibition of primary cell wall-related factors in addition to a limited effect on secondary cell wall-related processes.

gene ontology enrichment analysis   <cit>  of differentially expressed genes at  <dig> dpa indicated that no significant enrichment pertaining to a biological or molecular processes occurred at this stage in the li <dig>  goea analysis indicated that a large number of genes involved in known biological processes were detectable at  <dig> dpa, and many of these categories are known to be elongation-related processes, eg, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase  <cit> , beta-galactosidase  <cit> , shaggy-related kinase   <cit> , and auxin response genes  <cit>  . importantly, there was essentially no enrichment of probes specific for any biological or molecular processes that showed altered regulation at  <dig> dpa only.

*e-value in parenthesis.

a significant number of processes that were common to  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa, but not to  <dig> dpa showed altered expression in the mutant . goea analysis of this category of genes indicated a large decrease in probe sets categorized in nucleosome assembly  and lipid transport . there was an increase in mitochondrial electron transport , which includes nadh-dehydrogenase genes and nadh-plastoquinon oxidoreductase subunits, both members of complex i of the electron transport chain, known to be high producers of reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

fiber development-related genes show altered expression patterns in the li <dig> fibers . a large number of auxin, ethylene, and gibberellins responsive transcription factors were differentially expressed, as were cytoskeleton components such as tubulin and profilin. five probe sets identifying 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase genes, responsible for ethylene biosynthesis, were differentially expressed. ghi. <dig> , identified as ghaco <dig>  demonstrated significant up-regulation in the mutant, as did an uncharacterized aco homologue . however, ghaco <dig>  and another uncharacterized aco homologue  were down-regulated in the mutant, suggesting divergent roles in fiber elongation processes. another key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase   <cit> , was down-regulated in the mutant at  <dig> dpa. ghi. <dig> shares 100% homology with acc synthase  <dig> and  <dig>  .

twelve probe sets representing an unknown number of ap2/erf  domain-containing transcription factors were significantly differentially expressed, with the majority demonstrating down-regulation  . eight probe sets measuring levels of the pathogenesis-related  <dig>  proteins, a family of defense and stress-related genes regulated by jasmonic acid, ethylene and other effectors  <cit>  exhibited expression patterns  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher in the li <dig> mutant. sucrose synthase  <dig>  was highly up-regulated  at  <dig> dpa in the li <dig> mutant, then not differentially expressed at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa.

transcription analysis of cellulose synthase activity
cellulose synthases and cell wall re-arranging proteins have been a subject of interest as they relate to fiber elongation. more specifically, defining the role of specific cellulose syntheses in so far as their specificity for either primary or secondary cell wall processes is relevant to understanding elongation. previous research has speculated, and some data has suggested, that altered cellulose deposition determined the li <dig> phenotype  <cit> . in light of this, it was of value to further analyze cellulose synthase expression levels in the li <dig> mutant. probe sets annotated as cellulose synthase  genes or cellulose synthase-like  were identified by blast2go annotation, affymetrix-provided annotation terms, and by blastx analysis of the microarray probe sets. quantitative pcr analysis was conducted on selected ces genes. of the  <dig> probe sets annotated as ces or csl, only  <dig> probe set, ghiaffx. <dig> demonstrated reproducible > <dig> fold altered gene expression in the li <dig> mutant at the developmental stages analyzed . probe set ghiaffx. <dig> sequence was derived from one of  <dig> est’s homologous to sequence accession . in the wt the target sequence expression levels were relatively high at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa, then decreased at  <dig> dpa indicating potential function as a primary cell wall-related ces . importantly, the li <dig> mutant showed decreased expression levels relative to wt at the elongation stages analyzed. ghiaffx. <dig>  was identified as ghcesa <dig> , which shares 86% protein sequence identity with a. thaliana cesa <dig> , which is known to be important in primary cell wall synthesis  <cit> . other sequences analyzed; ghi. <dig> , ghi. <dig> , ghi. <dig> , ghi. <dig>  and ghi. <dig>   did not demonstrate altered expression in the li <dig> mutant .

corroboration of microarray data
sequences targeted by the microarray were selected for quantitative pcr analysis to corroborate the results obtained in the microarray . the selected sequences included genes that were up-regulated, down-regulated, and demonstrated no change in the li <dig> mutant. the  <dig> samples analyzed  by qpcr demonstrated results consistent with the microarray analysis. the probe sets targeting cellulose synthase-like protein e6-like demonstrated little alteration in gene expression in the li <dig> mutant according to the microarray data, and similar results were obtained with qpcr analysis. one of the eight probe sets targeting pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> family  exhibited a dramatic increase in expression, showing  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold increase in  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa, respectively. expansin a <dig>  a cell wall structural protein, was down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in microarray and qpcr, as were most expansins . expansin-like b <dig> was the only expansin up-regulated at  <dig> dpa, however the qpcr data for this gene was not entirely consistent with microarray data for  <dig> dpa. beta-galactosidase, which hydrolyses β-glycosidic bonds and is thought to be important for primary cell wall rearrangement, was down-regulated as measured by qpcr and microarray in all stages of development in the mutant. tubulina <dig> was expressed at extremely high levels  although differential regulation between wt and the li <dig> mutant was not significant.

*bold and underlined indicates significant at the bonferroni-corrected  <dig>  probability level for microarray data and at the  <dig>  probability as determined by a two-tailed t-test for qpcr data.

mapping the li <dig> locus region with ssr markers
of the  <dig>  f <dig> progeny,  <dig>  showed the li <dig> mutant phenotype, and  <dig> were wt. this segregation deviated significantly from a single dominant-gene model  presumably due to the failure of many homozygous mutants  to germinate or survive as suggested by rong et al.  <cit>  and liu et al.  <cit> . of the  <dig> ssr markers screened,  <dig>  were polymorphic between two dna bulks. of them,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were previously mapped on chr. <dig>  chr. <dig>  chr. <dig> and chr. <dig>  respectively based on the high density consensus map  <cit> . analysis of these  <dig> markers among  <dig> f <dig> progeny indentified only  <dig> markers that were associated with the li <dig> locus, and mapped on chr. <dig>  these  <dig> markers were further evaluated in the whole  <dig> f <dig> progeny plants. a map was constructed around the li <dig> region . the marker tmb <dig> was  <dig>  cm away from the li <dig> locus.

a total of  <dig> kb sequences from the introns of  <dig> genes residing in the  <dig> mb interval between markers tmb <dig> and dpl <dig> were compared between the wt and li <dig> mutant. however, we were unable to identify additional sequence polymorphisms to facilitate finer genetic mapping of the li <dig> locus.

functional analysis of the li <dig> region
based on the mapping results, genes within the 17-mb region between the best hits of the flanking ssr markers tmb <dig> and dpl <dig> in the g. raimondii reference genome were further analyzed. eighty probe sets from the microarray corresponded to genes that were in this interval, of which  <dig> showed altered expression in the li <dig> mutant . three of these genes were further evaluated by qpcr analysis to establish a link between the mapping and expression data. ghi. <dig> .s1_s_at, graaffx. <dig> .s1_s_at, ghiaffx. <dig> .s1_s_at have homology with glycosyl hydrolase family protein  <dig> , xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  <dig> , and attcp <dig> , respectively. the expression profile of the glycosyl hydrolase  <dig> showed altered expression in the mutant at  <dig> dpa by both microarray and qpcr . xyloglucan endotransglucosylase was up-regulated at early and mid elongation stages , and according to the microarray data remained slightly elevated at  <dig> dpa. the transcription factor tcp- <dig> was up-regulated at the late elongation stage of  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa.

discussion
a previous microarray experiment examining  <dig> and  <dig> dpa fibers from the li <dig> mutant found little evidence of global or significant alterations in gene expression patterns  <cit> . conversely, microarray data of  <dig> dpa fibers and proteomic analysis of  <dig> dpa from li <dig> fibers demonstrated significant perturbation of expression profiles in the mutant, indicating that processes related to primary cell wall elongation are affected in the li <dig> mutant  <cit> . in addition, earlier studies of the li <dig> mutant focusing on secondary cell wall synthesis failed to report findings of upstream processes being significantly affected  <cit> . thus this analysis on late elongation and early scw stages would complement and extend these earlier findings aimed to better characterize the effects of the mutation at both primary and secondary cell wall synthesis, and provide data for the fiber development during the transition period. the morphological and molecular data presented here supports the model that the li <dig> mutation is an upstream factor primarily targeting elongation processes. several ontological categories of genes and individual genes that have previously been identified as having a role in fiber elongation were identified, as were new targets for investigation.

previous proteomic analysis of li <dig> at  <dig> dpa  <cit>  identified a limited number of proteins that could be corroborated by our microarray data. a comprehensive analysis revealed that both data sets include the down regulation of cytoskelatal tubulin proteins and metabolism-related proteins . the stress response proteins nucleoredoxin and germin-like proteins, a flavanone-3-hydroxylase and translation factor  <dig> were increased in both data sets. however, the remainder of proteins identified as showing altered regulation were not corroborated by our data. a detail list is shown in the additional file  <dig>  this could be due to the difference in genetic background, or due to the technical limitations of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. analysis of more recent affymetrix microarray data obtained at  <dig> dpa  <cit>  is limited by the fact that the authors did not provide probe set information, thus preventing a more rigorous or comprehensive analysis from being conducted. however, they also identified several actin and tubulin genes that were down-regulated in the mutant. at  <dig> dpa there was an increase in xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, fascilin-like arabinogalactan protein, and the ethylene synthesis-related 1-aminocyclopropane −1-carboxylate oxidase  which our data indicated remained true at  <dig> dpa. as expected several differences also exist. analysis of  <dig> dpa fibers showed decrease expression levels of auxin-iaa-related genes and the ethylene responsive ap2/erf family genes, which then became up-regulated in the mutant at  <dig> dpa. conversely, another gene involved in ethylene production, ghaco <dig>  was up-regulated at  <dig> dpa but down-regulated in the mutant at  <dig> dpa. genes that were down-regulated in li <dig> at  <dig> dpa, but were at wt levels in  <dig> dpa were enriched in plasma membrane associated proteins , such as filament-like plant protein  <dig>  myosin heavy chain, and perk1-like protein kinase.

the use of the li <dig> mutant as a model system for both elongation and secondary cell wall synthesis was based on earlier studies utilizing li <dig> in a tm- <dig> genetic background that measured the ratio of fiber weight to length and showed an increase in fiber mass throughout development, implicating continued or increased cellulose deposition  <cit> . despite its very short fibers, the authors claimed the dry mass of the li <dig> fiber was approximately 83% of its nil. a second study using the same genetic line that measured  glucose deposition in the secondary cell wall indicated a 5-fold higher rate of cellulose deposition per mm of fiber in the li <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, much of our data using li <dig> in a dp <dig> genetic background suggested that molecular events involved in cellulose deposition and secondary cell wall synthesis were not affected to the degree that primary cell wall processes were. measurements indicated that the dry mass of the fiber was approximately 20% of its nil and that the actual cellulose content per unit mass remained unchanged . further, qpcr of cellulose synthase genes showed that secondary cell wall genes remained largely unaffected. these results support the model that thickening of the cell wall is due to inhibited elongation processes, but not due to increased cellulose production. the “increased rate” of glucose incorporation observed by kohel et al.  <cit>  was based on measurements of cellulose production per unit length instead of per unit mass. however, since elongation ceases in the li <dig> mutant but its cellulose production continues at wt levels, we speculate that li <dig> fibers expand outwardly, thus resulting in an increased cellulose production per unit length. it is worthy to mention that the use of a different nil in our study as compared with previous studies may also account for differences in fiber measurements.

the ontological categories of the  <dig> unique probes differentially expressed at  <dig> dpa included xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase activity  . xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase  enzymes are proposed to disrupt xyloglucan-cellulose crosslinks, thus permitting cell wall rearrangement and fiber elongation  <cit> . six probe sets identified as xth showed differential regulation in the li <dig> mutant. one probe set  was down-regulated at  <dig> dpa and significantly up-regulated  at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa . this gene  remains uncharacterized in gossypium, however its homeologous gene in a. thaliana tch4/xth <dig>  demonstrated very similar results in a study conducted on petiole elongation that indicated xth <dig> is under different genetic regulation than other characterized xth’s  <cit> . of the remaining xths identified in our microarray data, three probe sets exhibited decreased expression at  <dig> dpa and one slightly increased. while it is clearly plausible that a decreased expression of xths could lead to the inhibition of elongation, the role of xths that increased in the li <dig> mutant warrants further investigation. other ontological categories affected in the mutant included “responses to hormone synthesis”   and “hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing o-glycosyl compounds” , which contain  <dig> probe sets likely correlated with hormonal activation to signal entry into the primary to secondary cell wall transition stage  <cit> . the role of iaa, auxin response genes, and hormonal regulatory enzymes such as glucosyltranferases in fiber development processes has been widely documented  <cit> . it is of interest to note here that the only category identifying this set of related genes was the list of probes that were up or down-regulated only at  <dig> dpa. probe sets that were also enriched or decreased in  <dig> dpa mutant tissues  were not enriched in these ontological categories, implying that altered hormonal regulation in the mutant was occurring primarily before and at  <dig> dpa. analysis of hormone contents by chen et al.  <cit>  identified altered levels of abscisic acid, dihydrozeatin, and others in the li <dig> mutant, but only analyzed up to  <dig> dpa. microarray data on  <dig> dpa fibers reported altered expression of several hormone related peptides in the li <dig> mutant, such as auxin-related genes, gibberellins, brassinosteroid, abscisic acid and jasmonic acid-related genes  <cit> . these data suggest, when taken together with molecular and morphological data, that the early cessation of elongation in li <dig>  is in part due to the culmination of altered hormonal factors that occurs during early to mid elongation.

consistent with what has been reported at earlier developmental stages, multiple genes related to ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene response were differentially expressed in the li <dig> fibers  <cit> . a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase , hybridized by probe set ghi.5451and demonstrated a 2-fold down-regulation at  <dig> dpa . previous studies have correlated increased acs activity with cotton fiber elongation  <cit> . 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidases  1– <dig> are also involved in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . aco <dig>  showed a significant up-regulation at all stages analyzed, and aco <dig>  exhibited down-regulation at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa. aco <dig> and aco <dig>  did not show altered expression in the li <dig> mutant. consistent with our data, previous studies have implicated aco <dig> as having peak expression at the late elongation stage near  <dig> dpa. aco <dig> and  <dig> have demonstrated different expression patterns with peak expression in early secondary cell wall synthesis stage  <cit> , implying that they may be involved in later developmental stages. the fact that aco <dig> was related to elongation in previous studies and showed altered regulation in our microarray  further supports li <dig> being a key elongation-related mutation.

pathogenesis-related protein  <dig> family of proteins  exhibited a significant alteration in their expression patterns in the li <dig> mutant, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> fold difference between li <dig> and wt. this family of proteins consists of a large and functionally diverse group of proteins, ranging in function from antimicrobial/antiviral activity, hormone/ligand binding, secondary metabolism, and abiotic stress response . further implying a role in growth and development, individual pr <dig> proteins have been found to be regulated by multiple phytohormone-related cis-regulatory sequences including ethylene response elements  <cit>  and brassinosteroids  <cit> . however it remains unclear if the stress response seen in the li <dig> is related to previously mentioned ros levels or a response to altered hormone expression.

the cellulose synthase activity reported here is of particular interest. previous reports have speculated that an increase in secondary cell wall cellulose synthase activity may account for the thickened cell wall of the li <dig> <cit> , however, our data failed to confirm this. rather, another ghces, probed by ghi. <dig>  demonstrated altered expression at the elongation stage of development and showed an expression pattern consistent with elongation-related activity in the wt. translation of the probe target’s consensus sequence and tair blast search showed the ghi. <dig> target sequence shared highest homology, although not identity with atcesa <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> . atcesa <dig> is only expressed during embryogenesis, however the remaining atcesa <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig> are members of a primary cell wall associated cellulose synthase complex   <cit> . substantial evidence exists that these closely related genes are cell elongation related. atces <dig> null mutations showed a severe dwarf phenotype in a. thaliana, and functional studies have demonstrated that atcesa <dig> and − <dig> were partially functionally redundant during elongation  <cit> . a. thaliana mutants at the procust <dig> locus, which encodes cesa <dig>  exhibited cell elongation effects in a pleiotropic manner  <cit> . cesa <dig> promoter-gus fusion experiments have demonstrated that its expression occurs throughout the hypocotyl and root, peaking in the cell elongation zone of the expanding root  <cit> .

the li <dig> genetic locus was previously identified as residing on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . our results confirmed this chromosomal assignment. based on the high density consensus genetic map constructed by blenda et al.  <cit> , it could be seen that the li <dig> locus might be close to the centromeric region as original indicated by rong et al.  <cit> . it is worthy of mention that the genetic distances observed in our experiment were larger than those reported by rong et al.  <cit> . this greater recombination observed in our research might be due to our much larger  population size and different population structure . there is a large gap  between the li <dig> locus and marker dpl <dig> . we have screened all the ssr markers mapped in this interval based on the high density consensus map  <cit>  and a newly published map  <cit> , and could not further close the gap. additionally, we were unable to identify sequence polymorphisms among the  <dig> gene introns that were located in the region harboring the li <dig> locus even though some of these genes demonstrated differential expression between wt and mutant. this also indicates that altered gene expression may not be necessary due to gene sequence change. this result may also imply that the genomic region harboring li <dig> locus is highly monomorphic. recently, cai et al.  <cit>  reported a similar phenomenon when mapping the lix locus. one of their flanking markers, nau <dig>  was  <dig>  cm away from the lix locus.

the mapping data coupled with the recently released g. raimondii sequences provided the opportunity for additional analysis of sequences in the vicinity of the li <dig> locus. probe sets from the microarray with high homology to a glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  a xyloglucan endotrans-glucosylase hydrolase  <dig>  and attcp- <dig> are near the li <dig> locus, demonstrated differential expression in the li <dig> mutant and have apparent associations with elongation processes. in addition to the already discussed xth enzymes, glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  a family of related mannosidases, affect cell wall phenotypes when mutated in a. thaliana <cit> . interference with attcp- <dig> in planta in a. thaliana by fusion with a repressor domain resulted in severe developmental phenotypes characterized by reduced cellular elongation  <cit> . additionally, a transcription factor identified in gossypium barbadense with a highly homologous tcp domain, gbtcp, produced a short fiber phenotype when silenced by rnai  <cit> .

determining which, if any of these is the li <dig> mutation is currently under investigation. next-generation sequencing of transcripts by rna-seq is currently under way in our laboratory, and may reveal snps or splice variants responsible for either altered regulation of an elongation-specific gene, or a mutation resulting in a nonfunctional protein. identification of these variations will facilitate developing closer markers, and help to eventual cloning of the li <dig> gene.

the identification of the gene responsible for the li <dig> phenotype would provide an invaluable tool in the quest to understand fiber elongation processes. in the meantime, the data generated here, in combination with published data from other developmental time points, has the potential to provide a sound basis for the examination of key hormonal, structural, and other pathways involved in cotton fiber elongation.

CONCLUSIONS
measurements of fiber characteristics and microarray analysis of the li <dig> mutant and its wt were conducted at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa with the goal of enhancing our understanding of cotton fiber elongation. both methodologies supported the notion that the early cessation of elongation in li <dig> was due to disruption of primary cell wall elongation-related processes. further, we identified and discussed several elongation-related genes that exhibited altered expression profiles in the li <dig> mutant, including a putative primary cell-wall related cellulose synthase. we conducted ssr marker analysis on a large population, and using the g. raimondii reference sequence identified elongation-related genes near the li <dig> locus with altered expression levels. the data here will contribute to developing a comprehensive understanding of cotton fiber elongation.
