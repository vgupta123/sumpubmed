BACKGROUND
with the launching of large consortium projects like encode or fantom, the research community has become highly aware of an underestimated complexity of the eukaryotic genome and transcriptome. the “one gene - one rna - one protein” paradigm has been abandoned by realizing that coding and non-coding rna is exerting multiple functions in regulating cellular systems  <cit> . new technologies were utilized on sequencing the transcriptome to identify new classes of rnas, for example chimeric rna molecules containing exons from two directly adjacent genes of the same transcriptional orientation, termed read-through rnas. they supposedly arise through mechanisms not a priori requiring genomic rearrangements  <cit> . in fact, read-throughs favorably occur at minimal intergenic distance between the parent genes   <cit> . several years ago came the first reports of systematic large-scale computational analyses of read-through rnas which were termed “transcription-mediated gene fusion”, “tandem chimerism” and “conjoined genes”  <cit> . the authors of these studies used deposited data from est data bases and confirmed their predictions only in normal human tissues and a few cell lines. one can find only two recent comprehensive read-through studies in tumors, one on breast cancer  <cit>  and one on prostate cancer  <cit> . two additional studies in cancer report on fusion transcripts/chimeric rnas of which the vast majority is suspected of being read-throughs, although this is not clearly documented  <cit> . in other rna-seq papers, read-throughs are mentioned as a side note or in the supplement as they were not the focus of interest  <cit> . the only comprehensive study on renal cancer employing rna-seq has explicitly excluded read-throughs from the list of rna fusions  <cit> . rna read-through formation seems to be evolutionary conserved. a study in arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated evidence, that depletion of rna binding proteins causes impairement of transcription termination, thereby enhancing the expression of rna read-throughs which in parallel influence the expression levels of their parent genes  <cit> . little is known about the biological or disease-associated function of read-through rnas in humans. some read-throughs might encode functional chimeric proteins as exemplified in the case of twe-pril  <cit>  or ly75-cd <dig>  <cit> . slc45a3-elk <dig> as the prototype read-through in prostate cancer is not just a biomarker  <cit>  but has been shown to induce prostate cancer proliferation in-vitro in a recent study by zhang et al.  <cit> . the same group also demonstrated that slc45a3-elk <dig> is generated by cis-splicing and that its formation is mechanistically intertwined with androgen signaling. in summary, chimeric read-through transcripts may have implications in carcinogenesis.

here, we explore rna read-throughs by sequencing the transcriptome of human renal cell carcinoma , a malignancy where nothing major is known on read-through expression yet, and elaborate on the potential functions of two examples relevant to renal carcinogenesis.

RESULTS
numerous read-through rna chimeras are expressed in rcc
the rna-seq analysis by fusionseq called  <dig> read-throughs across the sample set representing about half  of all rna chimera calls . most of them had low  resper  values which is interpretable as humble expression levels of most read-throughs. resper not only is a confidence score for the candidate call by the software, it also gives an estimate about the expression level of the chimeric transcript. due to limited availability of rcc tissue we selected an arbitrary number of top- ) and bottom- ) candidates and confirmed  <dig> of  <dig>  top- and  <dig> of  <dig>  bottom-candidates with conventional reverse transcription -pcr . based on this finding, we assume that candidates with resper between  <dig>  and  <dig> also have a true positive rate around 79-85%. sanger sequencing of the pcr products enabled us to determine the read-throughs’ junction sequence and exon composition around this region . most read-through events  generated two to five different isoforms. for nine read-throughs existed only a single transcript. the most obvious splicing pattern  is the exclusion of terminal exons from the upstream parent gene and initial exons from the downstream parent gene, using known exon-intron boundaries. other isoforms  used new gt—ag splice sites in introns or exons to lengthen or shorten an exon or to introduce a new exon from intergenic sequence. a third group of isoforms  retained intergenic sequence, in some instances suggesting that the 3′ parent contributes an extended 3′utr to the 5′ parent gene. knowing the read-throughs’ exon compositions enabled us to build putative coding sequences. only in 12% of the isoforms the exon junction was in-frame which might fuse both parent open reading frames  forming an intact fusion orf . most often, exon junctions were outside of the 5′ parent’s orf  or caused frameshifts and premature stop codons in the 5′ genes . about 20% of the isoforms were originating from read-throughs between known genes and non-coding rnas, merely annotated with data bank accession numbers, and therefore termed “non-classical”. the functional consequence in such instances is unclear. one read-through was a known antisense transcript  <cit> .figure  <dig> a panel of read-throughs is expressed in rcc.  the fraction of different classes of rna chimeras called by fusionseq from the rnaseq data in seven frozen rcc samples. the clinical characteristics of the samples are given elsewhere  <cit> . ccrcc, clear cell rcc; chrrcc, chromophobe rcc; trcc, xp <dig> translocation rcc.   <dig> read-throughs which were chosen for further validation by reverse transcription -pcr. plotted are the individual resper scores per sample and the mean resper with range if the read-through was found in more than  <dig> sample.  quantitative evaluation of  <dig> read-throughs by taqman assays in frozen tissue of rcc and matched adjacent normal kidney, plotted as tukey boxplots. no read-through has significant differential expression between tumor and normal tissue as calculated by student’s t-test with correction for multiple testing by bonferroni method. the blue outlier dot in tmed6-cog <dig> is the trcc whose detailed analysis is featured elsewhere  <cit> .

read-throughs are sorted in three types: classical, if the parent genes’ structure and orf are well defined; non-classical, if at least one parent gene is incompletely defined non-coding rna or pseudogene or the read-through being an antisense transcript; extended 3′utr, if the 3′ parent likely represents a longer 3′utr sequence to complement the 5′ parent with. the number of isoforms per read-through is given in the third column, together with the names of klk4-krsp <dig> and bc039389-gatm isoforms specifically featured in this publication . the exon junction is given between 5′ parent and 3′ parent gene according to their ncbi entries and hg <dig> assembly, as exemplified with wrb-sh3bgr: wrb exon  <dig>  is spliced to sh3bgr exon  <dig> . a second isoform with same exon junction exists where sh3bgr exons  <dig> and  <dig> are spliced out . some exons were shortened at previously unknown positions  before they were connected to the other parent gene. some exons were spliced to lose a short part of the sequence inside the exon . some isoforms retained the entire or partial intergenic sequence  between the parent genes or spliced elements of it . an exon junction with intronic sequence is indicated as “i” ). the second to last column shows the coding consequence of the exon junction further described in table  <dig>  the last column “taqman” indicates the isoforms that were targeted in the expression screening depicted in figure 1c. *tmed6-cog <dig> has been identified as part of this study but evaluated in detail elsewhere  <cit> .

in this data set, fusion seq called many read-throughs only in one or two samples . however, their expression was mostly not restricted to just one sample as shown in subsequent quantitative measurement of read-through expression in a larger sample set. we selected  <dig> read-throughs  for differential expression analysis by taqman qpcr and found that  <dig> were expressed in all rcc samples , one chromophobe rcc , four papillary rccs ,  <dig> clear cell rccs ) and at levels that were equal to their matched benign kidney tissues . however, two read-throughs presented with exceptional expression pattern.

read-throughs bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> are overexpressed in rcc
the first read-through which caught our interest was bc039389-gatm  occurring between the non-coding rna bc <dig> with unknown function and gatm  . alternative splicing of gatm exons  <dig> or  <dig> produces the two bc039389-gatm isoforms v <dig> and v <dig>  bgv <dig> was expressed in all rcc samples and the levels were significantly elevated compared to the matched normal kidney tissues . a direct comparison in  <dig> samples revealed that the levels of the minor bc039389-gatm variant  were one log lower in most cancer tissues and not detectable in most normal tissues .figure  <dig> description of read-through bc039389-gatm.  dna: genomic structure of bc <dig> and gatm on the dna  strand. rna: two isoforms are expressed from the genomic locus both utilizing the same alternative atg in gatm exon  <dig> for putative protein translation. taqman assay positions and the positions targeted by sirnas are indicated.  differential expression of bc039389-gatm isoform  <dig>  in tumor vs. normal kidney tissue .  comparison of bgv <dig> and bgv <dig> expression in  <dig> frozen tumor/normal sample pairs using taqman assays.



the second interesting read-through was klk4-krsp <dig>  involving klk <dig>  a member of the serine protease family of tissue kallikreins and its pseudogene krsp <dig> . after the initial confirmation of kk in the index case , we screened a larger cohort and found klk4-krsp <dig> isoform  <dig>  expression restricted to  <dig> of  <dig>  rccs . we also checked kkv <dig> expression in matching normal kidney of the  <dig> cases and found that only ten had detectable levels of kkv <dig>  furthermore, our screen revealed that expression of the minor variant kkv <dig> was restricted to only rccs with highest kkv <dig> expression ) . since kkv <dig> was even weaker expressed than kkv <dig>  and kkv <dig> and kkv <dig> were detected later as byproducts in a cloning effort to generate kk orfs, the focus was set on screening expression of kkv <dig> and kkv <dig> only.figure  <dig> description of read-through klk4-krsp <dig>   dna: genomic structure of klk <dig> and krsp <dig> on the dna  strand. rna: at least five isoforms are expressed from the genomic locus. a pink line represents the splice site in klk <dig> exon  <dig> which leads to a frameshift and subsequent stop codon in the rna and the use of an alternative  atg start codon in putative kkv <dig> and kkv <dig> proteins. green and brown lines indicate the splice sites in klk <dig> exon  <dig>  utilized in kkv <dig> and kkv <dig>  respectively. taqman assay positions and the positions targeted by sirnas are indicated.  expression levels of klk4-krsp <dig> isoform  <dig>  in  <dig> frozen tumor/normal sample pairs using taqman assay.  kkv <dig> expression in tumor/normal tissue pairs was screend for  <dig> kkv1-positive samples.



we designed several taqman assays targeting the read-throughs’ parent genes to measure the expression profile of exons excluded  or included  in the read-through transcripts . tumors expressing bgv <dig> had significantly elevated total  and wild-type  levels of the 5′ parent bc <dig> compared to matched normal kindey . despite elevated bgv <dig>  total levels of the 3′ parent gatm were significantly reduced. gatm wild-type transcript was not differentially expressed. similarly, tumors expressing kkv <dig> also had significantly elevated total and wild-type levels of the 5′ parent klk <dig>  when compared to their matched normal tissues . similar to the reduction of gatmtot in bgv1-expressing samples, there was a trend of reduction seen for krsp1tot in kkv1-expressing samples, too, although not significant. krsp1wt remained unchanged. for the purpose of comparison, the measurements in tumors without any kkv <dig> expression differed considerably . there, klk4tot and klk4wt levels were significantly reduced when compared to their matched normal tissue. taken together, this suggests that high expression of the 5′ parent might sway read-through expression and that a reduction of the 3′ parent may also contribute to read-through expression.figure  <dig> expression levels of the read-throughs’ parent genes in tissues.  expression of the bc <dig> and gatm parent genes alone  or with read-throughs  in  <dig> frozen tumor and matched normal samples. one sample had not suffient rna left for measuring wild-type and bc <dig> tot levels. the location of the taqman assays is indicated in figure 2a.  expression of the klk <dig> and krsp <dig> parent genes  in  <dig> samples expressing kkv <dig> read-through  or  <dig> samples not expressing kkv <dig> . to be consistent in showing normal tissues, we artificially calculated kkv <dig> expression for  <dig> of  <dig> normal samples using the cut-off of ct <dig>  as kkv <dig> was expressed only in  <dig> normal tissues of the kkv1-expressing cohort. the location of the taqman assays is indicated in figure 3a. significance was calculated using student’s t-test in paired samples .



having identified bg and kk as potential novel players in human rcc, we went on screening a panel of  <dig> cell lines. all cell lines expressed bgv <dig> ,  <dig> cell lines expressed bgv <dig>  and kkv <dig> expression was restricted to  <dig> cell lines .

clinical parameters of rccs expressing klk4-krsp1
we performed some association analyses of kkv <dig> expression with known clinical parameters. kkv <dig> expression correlated significantly with larger tumors, high grade tumors and the histological subtype . notably, all chromophobe  and 50% papillary type  <dig> , compared to 20% clear cell  and 13% papillary type  <dig> rccs in our cohort expressed kkv <dig>  survival analysis of the ccrcc sub-cohort  showed a significantly reduced overall survival for patients with kkv <dig> was expressing tumors .table  <dig>

bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> influence gene regulation in a converse manner compared to their respective parent transcript
having identified several cell lines expressing bg and kk, we were able to perform some functional analyses. we first searched for target genes by knocking-down the major isoforms of bg read-through  and kk read-through  in selected cell lines . subsequent genome-wide microarray analyses revealed several significantly differentially regulated genes  of which  <dig> with tumor-related functions  were selected for re-evaluation on rna and protein level . most striking was the distinctively pronounced reciprocal regulation of interleukin  <dig>  in bg knock-down  versus the knock-down of the functional parent gene gatm . sibg induced il <dig> whereas sigatmwt reduced it . il <dig> protein levels were too low to be detected by western blot. therefore, we used elisa to show that the il <dig> regulation was also apparent on protein level in the cell lines . in concordance with the cell line data, we saw a trend of increased il <dig> levels in normal tissues  and reduced il <dig> in tumor tissues .figure  <dig> functional consequences of klk4-krsp <dig> and bc039389-gatm read-throughs on gene expression.  heatmaps showing significantly dysregulated genes by bgv <dig>  or kkv <dig>  from genome-wide expression analysis of cancer  cell lines caki- <dig>  achn, a <dig>  lncap, sorted from most down-regulated to most up-regulated in read-through knock-down vs. mock treatment. pink rectangles mark the genes chosen for taqman qpcr validation of the data sets . arrows indicate the genes chosen for further experimentation.  il <dig> expression in bg and gatmwt knock-down cells compared to si negative control .  il <dig> levels measured by elisa in bg and gatmwt knock-down cells compared to si nc.  litaf expression in kkv <dig> and klk4wt knock-down cells.  litaf levels on western blot in kkv <dig> and klk4wt knock-down cells compared to si nc. significance was calculated using student’s t-test .



a similar reciprocal regulation was observed for lipopolysaccharide-induced tnf factor  in kkv <dig> knock-down  versus the knock-down of the functional parent gene klk <dig> . sikkv <dig> reduced litaf whereas siklk4wt induced its expression . litaf protein was clearly detectable by western blot; but although there was a downregulation of litaf upon kkv <dig> knock-down, an upregulation of litaf upon siklk4wt was visible only weakly in caki- <dig> and a <dig> . we concluded that western blot may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect the small increase in litaf in all cell lines reliably. to substantiate the cell line data, quantitative measurements in tumor tissues were conducted and confirmed significantly reduced litaf levels in rccs without kkv <dig> expression  compared to rccs expressing kkv <dig>  having increased litaf expression .

bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> influence migration and invasion inversely compared to their respective parent transcript
we observed such inverse effects of read-through and parent gene also on migratory and invasive properties of cell lines . achn had reduced migration/invasion, whereas caki- <dig> had increased migration/invasion upon bgv <dig> knock-down . gatmwt knock-down had an opposing effect on achn  and caki- <dig> . bg knock-down with sibgv <dig> or sibgv <dig> alone or as double knock-down in a <dig> was performed although this cell line is minimally migratory and not invasive. all three bg knock-downs caused increased migration, but sigatmwt did not reverse this effect. bgv <dig> knock-down had no gross influence on neither proliferation nor metabolic rates in cancer cell lines . a small significant reduction in proliferation was seen upon bgv <dig> knock-down in the normal kidney cell line hk- <dig> figure  <dig> functional consequences of klk4-krsp <dig> and bc039389-gatm read-throughs on migration and invasion.  invasion and migration changes in cell lines under read-through or parent gene knock-down in comparison to si negative control  . the migration/invasion of cells was measured in real-time and first plotted as delta cell index  per given time period . then the slopes of the curves of cells treated with targeting sirnas were calculated in comparison to the baseline si nc curve and plotted as bar chart, where a minus slope indicates less migration, and a positive slope more migration than si nc, respectively. these experiments were performed as technical duplicates in biological replicates as indicated.



we observed alterations of migratory and invasive capacities of cell lines under kkv <dig> knock-down. achn and a <dig> had increased migration/invasion, whereas caki- <dig> had reduced migration/invasion . the knock-down with siklk4wt could reverse the effect of sikkv <dig> in all three cell lines. none of the cancer cell lines altered proliferative or metabolic rates under kkv <dig> depletion .

bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> read-throughs likely belong to the non-coding rna class
despite all our efforts, we were unable to identify endogenous protein translated from bg or kk . although these experiments do not fully eliminate the possibility that the read-throughs still produce functional proteins, it suggests that the effects which we observed upon read-through knock-down are caused by the rna molecules themselves. we found kkv <dig> enriched in the nuclear fraction of rcc cells , possibly indicating a role in transcription regulation. bgv <dig> was more abundantly expressed in the cytosol , possibly suggesting a role in processes taking place in this cellular compartment. further experiments are mandatory to pinpoint the mechanism by which the read-throughs are exerting their function.

discussion
this is the first study that aims at elucidating the role of read-through rna chimeras in rcc. we identified read-throughs b039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> up-regulated in rcc compared to normal kidney. we show that these read-throughs are able to functionally oppose at least one of their two parent genes exemplified by altering migration and invasion properties of cell lines and by inversely regulating il <dig>  and litaf .

a direct comparison of our  <dig> read-through calls obtained from rna-seq in rcc with six in breast cancer  <cit>  and  <dig> in prostate cancer  <cit>  revealed only a marginal overlap of identical read-through calls. such discrepancies may be explained by diverging expression of rna read-throughs in different cancer types, but also by the non-uniformity of the employed data filtering strategies.

only a few reports describe a putative functional impact of read-throughs on cancer  <cit>  with the most convincing one reported for slc45a3-elk <dig> in prostate cancer, where the read-through promotes cell proliferation but wild-type elk <dig> does not  <cit> . our study is the first one in which functional consequences of read-throughs were investigated in rcc.

the function of bc <dig>  one of the parent genes of bg, is yet unknown. the second parent gene gatm catalyzes the rate limiting step of creatine synthesis and its expression is seen in various tissues, with the highest levels observed in kidney. it was shown that both the protein  and the mrna  expression of gatm is reduced in rcc compared to normal kidney. we hypothesize that after transcription of gatm, the 3′ exons  are more susceptible to degradation compared to the 5′ exons . this may explain both the reduction of gatmtot in rcc and the unchanged expression of gatmwt when compared to normal kidney, seen in our study. steady transcription of exon  <dig> is probably required to be spliced for the sake of generating bg. even under the condition of reduced gatm in tumor, there still exists a manifold excess of gatm mrna over bg read through, preventing us from detecting the increase of bg when measuring gatmtot in tumor. we suspect that bg expression is not only driven by bc <dig> increase, but that also gatm loss plays a role since such loss evokes an increase of bg expression, as reflected by the significant induction of bgv <dig> by  <dig> - to 2-fold in the experiment with sigatmwt knock-down in achn and caki- <dig> . we used microarrays to find out whether bgv <dig> influences the expression of genes. the most prominent target gene was il <dig>  a cytokine. il <dig> regulation is critical in a lung metastasis mouse model where it was shown that rcc cells with high il <dig> have less competence to metastasize because they seem to attract tumor-cytotoxic neutrophils to the metastatic niche in the lung  <cit> . preventing the recruitment of such killer neutrophils through downregulation of il <dig> may well be one of the synergistic functions of reducing gatm and increasing bg in cancer cells. hence, we suspect a rather tumor-promotive function of bg. we can observe this in form of reduced migration/invasion of achn cells upon bgv <dig> knock-down, but this effect is cell line-dependent. regarding the effects on il <dig> and migration/invasion as two independent examples of reciprocal regulation, we can corroborate the theory that the read-through transcript bg and wild-type gatm are functionally opposing each other in such a manner that ultimately the result may be beneficial for tumorigenesis.

recently, the klk4-krsp <dig> read-through has been described in a publication on pseudogenes  <cit> . the authors describe high expression of, what we named, kkv <dig> in prostate cancer. both parent genes of this read-through are part of the large family of tissue kallikreins. with the emerging role of tissue kallikreins in cancer  <cit> , klk <dig> expression has been profiled in several cancer tissues e.g. prostate  <cit> , ovary  <cit> , endometrium  <cit>  and colon  <cit> . elevated klk <dig> levels were frequently associated with higher tumor grade in endometrial and prostate cancer  <cit>  and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer  <cit> . kallikreins are secreted proteases and klk <dig> appears to be the only representative of this family with pro-proliferative function mainly localized to the nucleus  <cit> . little is known about the function of krsp <dig>  it potentially can be translated into a protein which is primarly present in the nucleus  <cit> . also for kk, we hypothesize that the 5′ parent’s expression is driving the read-through’s expression, as klk4tot and klk4wt levels are higher in tumors expressing kkv <dig> than in their matched normal kidney tissues. similar to our hypothesis of an interplay between gatm loss and bg increase, the parent genes’ expression data for kk is hinting towards a role of krsp <dig> loss in kk expression. we were unable to directly proof such a link, since we could not design a sirna targeting specifically krsp1wt  has great homology to all members of the family of tissue kallikreins) to perform a krsp1wt knock-down eventually increasing kkv <dig> expression. after microarray analysis, we found litaf as a major target gene of kkv <dig>  the literature about litaf function in cancer is inconsistent. one report mechanistically proofs litaf as p53-repressed  <cit> . putting this in the context of rcc, where loss of pvhl in 70% of ccrccs may contribute to destabilization of p <dig>  <cit> , one could expect increased litaf in these ccrccs. with kkv <dig>  we have found yet another player in litaf up-regulation expressed in 20% of ccrccs. we also report kkv <dig> expression frequently associated with prcc type  <dig> and chrrcc, histological rcc subtypes in which vhl and p <dig> are largely functional. there, litaf up-regulation could be mediated almost exclusively by kkv <dig>  since we observe worse survival for patients in the presence of kkv <dig>  we would attribute kkv <dig> rather tumor-promotive properties. however, a tumor-promotive effect of kkv <dig> on migration/invasion of rcc cells is cell line-dependent and may be one reason why kkv <dig> did not correlate with local or distant metastasis in patients.

although previous reports suggest that some read-throughs encode fusion proteins  <cit> , we and others  <cit>  suspect that most read-throughs suit the class of non-coding rna. in accordance with prakash et al.  <cit> , most of the read-throughs we are reporting here are not predicted to encode fusion proteins. any analysis of endogenous protein levels is difficult in consideration of the low levels of read-through expression. low resper scores and high ct values  demonstrate that read-throughs are mostly transcribed at rather low rate. and despite all our efforts, we have found no proof of protein expression from either bg or kkv <dig> 

in summary, we demonstrate for the first time that read-throughs act as regulators by counteracting their parent genes in suppressing or activating genes or mechanisms in renal cancer. yet, how they regulate and how they themselves are regulated is still to be determined. most of our read-throughs were similarly expressed in tumor and normal tissue. however, the fact that bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig> are two examples of read-throughs expressed at higher levels in tumor tissue hints towards a rather oncogenic function for some read-throughs. this coincides with the hypothesis that rna chimerism is more frequently observed in prostate cancer than in benign prostate tissue  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a growing body of literature on rna chimeras indicates that chimeric read-through transcripts have implications in cancer. we show that such read-through transcripts are abundantly expressed in renal cell carcinoma and, on the basis of two examples bc039389-gatm and klk4-krsp <dig>  may be tumor-promoting and impacting cellular properties in a way which inverses the effect of their wild-type parent transcripts.
