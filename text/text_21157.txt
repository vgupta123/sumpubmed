BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of q fever, a zoonosis that occurs worldwide and infects a variety of different animals, including domestic mammals like cattle and sheep. whereas animals in general show no clinical signs of infection except occasional abortions, c. burnetii can cause serious illness in humans, where infections usually occur via aerosols. acute disease often presents as a self-limiting influenza-like illness with fever and headaches, but severe cases with atypical pneumonia or hepatitis may occur. the disease can become chronic with life-threatening endocarditis as the most frequent clinical manifestation that requires long lasting antibiotic treatment  <cit> . although an obligate intracellular organsim, the bacterium is very resistant to environmental conditions due to extracellular spore-like forms, and even a single organism can produce disease. because of its widespread availability, environmental stability and low infective dose, c. burnetii is considered a potential bioterrorist agent and is classified as a group b agent by the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta, usa  <cit> .

c. burnetii is a slow growing bacterium that can be cultivated in embryonated eggs or eukaryotic cell culture, which is time consuming and must be performed in biosafety level  <dig> laboratories. antigen detection of bacteria by capture elisa or direct immunofluorescence is difficult and has relatively high detection limits. therefore, diagnosis is still mainly based on serological methods like indirect immunofluorescence, complement fixation or elisa, with the disadvantage of delayed diagnosis because specific antibodies appear only one to two weeks after infection  <cit> .

during the last years, several pcr based diagnostic assays were developed to detect c. burnetii dna in cell cultures and clinical samples. these assays used conventional pcr  <cit> , nested pcr  <cit>  or real-time pcr conditions with lightcycler  <cit> , sybr green  <cit>  or taqman chemistry  <cit> . the target sequences of the assays originated from singular chromosomal genes like com <dig> or htpb, on plasmids  or on the transposase gene of insertion element is <dig>  <cit>  that is present in  <dig> copies in the genome of the c. burnetii nine mile rsa <dig> strain  <cit> . due to the multicopy number of the is <dig> element, the corresponding pcr is very sensitive. however, quantification of cells cannot be performed based on pcr of the is element, because the numbers of is <dig> elements present in different coxiella isolates are not known.

the prerequisite for a diagnostic pcr is a target sequence that is specific for c. burnetii to exclude false positive results with other organisms and that is conserved and present in all c. burnetii isolates to prevent false negative reactions. the pcr assays mentioned before were usually evaluated with relatively small numbers of characterized isolates or with uncharacterized clinical samples, though it should be noted that most importance was attached on sensitivity of the assay, whereas the suitability of the assays for a great panel of different isolates was less relevant.

the icd gene for the isocitrate dehydrogenase was sequenced in  <dig> strains and shown to be conserved  <cit> . we used a fragment of this gene as target for real-time taqman pcr based on taqman chemistry. in addition, we performed a real-time pcr assay based on a fragment of the transposase gene of the is element is1111a. both assays were validated for specificity and sensitivity, and suitability of the icd assay for the quantification of coxiella cell numbers was shown. as the exact number of is elements is only known for the sequenced genome of the nine mile strain, we examined the number of is <dig> elements per genome, or per icd copy, respectively, in a large panel of coxiella isolates of worldwide origin.

RESULTS
evaluation of the specificity of the real-time pcr assays
to determine whether false positive reactions occurred in real-time pcr assays with the icd and is <dig> markers, pcr was performed with dna of the bacterial species listed in the methods section. based on the sequence of its 16s rrna, c. burnetii is classified into the order legionellales, with legionella spp. and francisella spp. as nearest phylogenetic neighbours  <cit> . both for these related species and for all other species tested, the pcr was negative, confirming the specificity of both targets.

determination of precision and detection limit of the assays
based on the measured dna concentration  and the length of the published sequence of the c. burnetii nine mile genome , the theoretical number of genome equivalents  was calculated to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> ge per μl. this corresponds to  <dig>  ×  <dig> is <dig> elements per μl for the nine mile strain . to determine the precision of the icd and is real-time pcr assays, ct  values for eight replicates of tenfold dilutions of purified c. burnetii nine mile genomic dna were measured . the results represent independent dilution series and different pcr runs. the mean ct values, standard deviation, and percent cv  were calculated for each dilution. the results showed low variability, with cvs ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for the icd target and  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for the is target, indicating efficient reproducibility of both assays. standard curves drawn from the copy numbers and mean ct values shown in table  <dig> had slopes of - <dig>  for the icd curve and - <dig>  for the is curve , indicating pcr efficiencies of approximately  <dig> % for both targets .

determination of the detection limit by probit analysis was performed with dna of the c. burnetii nine mile strain. for the singular icd marker, detection of  <dig> to  <dig>  ge/reaction was tested by pcr. for the is <dig> marker, where  <dig> copies are expected per genome, lower concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig>  ge/reaction, or  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the is <dig> element, respectively, were tested. each pcr was repeated three times with eight replicates for each concentration. the minimal number of genome equivalents per reaction that could be detected with a  <dig> % probability by real-time pcr was  <dig> when the icd marker was used . with the is <dig> marker,  <dig>  genome equivalents per reaction were detected with  <dig> % probability , corresponding to  <dig> copies of the target gene. detection of lower is <dig> copy numbers was possible, as mentioned below for plasmid standards, but less reproducible. pcr products of the icd and is <dig> assays were analysed on agarose gels and showed the expected single bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively.

quantification using plasmid standard curves
tenfold serial dilutions of plasmids with cloned icd and is <dig> fragments were used to establish standard curves for each pcr run. for both markers, the quantification was linear over a range of  <dig> to  <dig> starting plasmid copy numbers, and the detection limit was ten copies per reaction .

to assess whether the number of icd and is <dig> copies per genome could be sufficiently calculated by using standard curves derived from plasmid standards, pcr assays for both targets were performed with tenfold serial dilutions of c. burnetii nine mile dna and plasmid standards. the results are shown in table  <dig>  especially for lower dna concentrations, the theoretical numbers of icd and is <dig> copies  corresponded quite well to the respective copy numbers determined experimentally.

determination of coxiella cell numbers by real-time pcr
the cell numbers of purified coxiella isolates can be determined by gimenez stain. to assess whether the cell densities quanitified by real-time pcr were comparable, we performed pcr reactions of heat inactivated isolates targeting the icd marker without previous dna extraction. an exponential dilution series was made from heat inactivated particles of the nine mile isolate containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> particles per ml, and  <dig> μl of each dilution was applied per pcr reaction. cell numbers were quantified using standard curves derived from diluted plasmid standards. the results are shown in table  <dig>  given that only one copy of the chromosome is present per bacterial cell, which can be expected for a slow growing bacterium like coxiella, the number of genome equivalents based on icd quantification should be comparable to the number of bacteria. indeed, the icd quantity correlated well with the numbers of coxiellae determined microscopically. the detection limit for real-time pcr was  <dig> particles per reaction, which is in good agreement with the detection limit for purified coxiella dna and far below the particle number that can be quantified microscopically.

determination of the number of is elements in  <dig> different coxiella isolates
although the measured icd and is <dig> copy numbers shown in table  <dig> exceeded the calculated numbers in some cases, the number of is <dig> elements per genome  varied between  <dig> and  <dig> for different dna concentrations, which is close to the published number of  <dig> is <dig> elements for the nine mile isolate. therefore, with this assay, dna samples of  <dig> isolates of c. burnetii from all over the world were assessed for presence of the icd and is markers and the numbers of is <dig> elements per genome were calculated. quantification of icd and is markers was based on standard curves obtained from diluted plasmids. each dna sample was tested in duplicate in three independent pcr runs targeting both markers except for dna from the nine mile isolate, where six runs were performed.

in a recent study where q fever patients were examined  <dig> years after infection, the is <dig> element could not be amplified, whereas pcr for other targets was positive  <cit> . our results indicated that all isolates contained both the icd and the is <dig> markers. different pcr runs resulted in discrepancies of the measured quantities and accordingly, different values and standard deviations for the number of is <dig> elements per genome equivalent were obtained . for the nine mile rsa <dig> strain the number of is elements was determined to be  <dig> , which is in good agreement with the number revealed by sequencing. the mean number of is <dig> elements per genome varied between seven  and  <dig> , and between  <dig> and  <dig> for the majority of isolates. in french isolates of the related restriction groups  <dig> to  <dig> , however, the number of is <dig> elements was found to be above  <dig>  being highest in strain "raphael" . all isolates of restriction group i had numbers below  <dig> insertion elements, so that for these isolates a correlation of the number of is <dig> elements with the restriction group seems likely. in other restriction groups, however, the number of is <dig> elements was highly variable. although the standard deviations were very high for some values, our data suggest that the number of is <dig> elements can vary widely between different c. burnetii isolates and some isolates seem to contain a very high number of is <dig> elements. to further confirm our real-time pcr based quantification, southern blot analyses should be performed.

insertion sequences play a major role in determining band pattern differences between isolates produced by methods such as pfge  in many bacterial species  <cit> . c. burnetii expresses a low degree of genetic heterogeneity among strains by dna-dna hybridization. however, not i restriction of total dna followed by pfge resulted in the characterization of  <dig> restriction groups among  <dig> c. burnetii isolates collected worldwide, as indicated in table  <dig> <cit> . typing c. burnetii based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the locations of the is <dig> element, like published for the insertion sequence is <dig> of yersinia pestis  <cit> , may add to the elucidation of the phylogenetic relationship of coxiella isolates. moreover, the insertion sites of is <dig> could be examined by inverse pcr or by a recently described technique, the so called vectorette pcr  <cit> .

so far, our data are too incomplete for judgements on clinical outcome, namely, to find any correlation between the number of is <dig> elements and the virulence of an isolate. nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that an increased number of is elements in the genome of an isolate could have a deteriorating effect on its fitness, because essential genes might be interrupted by the insertion sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
we validated taqman-based real-time pcr assays targeting the singular icd gene and the transposase of the is1111a element present in multiple copies in the genome of c. burnetii. the assays were evaluated with a variety of other bacterial species and shown to be specific for c. burnetii. dilution series of c. burnetii dna and of plasmids with cloned icd and is <dig> inserts demonstrated the sensitivity of the assays. less than  <dig> genome equivalents per reaction were reproducibly detected. using the icd marker, cell numbers of c. burnetii isolates were quantified also at very low cell concentrations. as a first approximation, the combination of both assays was useful to assess the numbers of is <dig> elements in  <dig> c. burnetii isolates from all over the world. our data indicate that the numbers of this insertion element in the different isolates seem to be highly variable. the differences in the content of is <dig> elements might be of importance for further phylogentic analyses of c. burnetii isolates.
