BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases  are a family of approximately  <dig> proteolytic enzymes involved in extracellular matrix  homeostasis in normal physiology, wound-healing  <cit>  and in various pathologies. the involvement of mmps in pathology may be grouped into those involved in tissue destruction; for example in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, ulceration and periodontal disease; those promoting fibrosis in fibrotic lung disease, cirrhosis and multiple sclerosis; and those that weaken the matrix as seen in cardiomyopathies and some dermatological conditions  <cit> . mmps have been the subject of much investigation surrounding their potential as suitable pharmacological targets for various disease states. the first disease target of mmp inhibition was rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> ; however in recent years matrix metalloproteinase inhibition  has been considered for various other conditions including osteoarthritis  <cit> , cardiovascular disease  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> .

thus far, the development of many mmpis has been limited by their tendency to elicit various undesirable connective tissue pathologies in both preclinical animal models and in the clinic, at efficacious blood concentrations. in man, these side effects present as musculoskeletal syndrome , a disorder originating in the shoulder or hands, characterised by musculoskeletal pain and inflammation leading to reduced joint mobility  <cit> . in pre-clinical animal models, tissue pathologies tend to occur following  <dig> to  <dig> days administration of mmpi, appear to be dose-dependent, and are generally reversible on discontinuation of mmpi therapy  <cit> . in the rodent, clinical signs following mmpi administration include reduced movement, reluctance to rest on the hind limbs, and increased hind paw volume. histological assessment reveals several characteristic findings including growth plate thickening, synovial hyperplasia, soft tissue fibroplasias and lymphocyte infiltrates  <cit> . these features associated with mmpi administration have been collectively termed "fibrodysplasia"  <cit> . in the canine, the most sensitive site for mmpi- induced fibrodysplasia is the subcuticular connective tissue which is affected from  <dig> days post-treatment, although other musculoskeletal tissues are extensively involved, as with other species, as administration continues  <cit> .

further compounding the liability of mmpis to elicit fd is the current lack of functional biomarkers suitable for early in vivo screening. indeed, to date most studies have concentrated on the effects of mmpis at the end-of-treatment once fd is manifest, and following termination, using a variety of time-intensive histological techniques  <cit> . it is this inability to screen for early fd effects in vivo that led us to consider alternative classes of biomarkers. one class of potentially informative biomarkers is the microrna family . these short, non-protein-coding rnas modulate protein translation from specific mrnas  <cit> . they have been implicated in a variety of biological processes and are reported to regulate the majority of genes in the human genome  <cit> . similar to many messenger rnas , mirnas exhibit marked tissue specificity  <cit> , and appear to be dysregulated in response to specific pathological conditions  <cit> . perhaps most significant is the finding that mirnas are readily detectable in various biological fluids   <cit>  and remain stable during routine clinical processing  <cit> , paving the way for their use as novel biomarkers.

herein, we report a global assessment of mirna expression in the cervical subcutaneous tissue of dogs treated with the broad-spectrum mmpi azm <dig> at a dosage of 20mg/kg/day for between  <dig> and  <dig> days. this dose has been previously shown to induce subcutaneous fd following  <dig> days of administration in a pilot study involving two female beagle dogs . a detailed histopathological report of the changes associated with fd in this study was published first in  <dig>  <cit>  and described a phased onset of fd in the cervical subcutaneous tissue following  <dig> days administration of azm <dig>  more recently, an analysis of the changes in messenger rna  expression and in mmp activity following azm <dig> administration was reported  <cit> . the experimental aims of this study were to  further characterise the molecular events directly preceding the initiation and during the development of mmpi-induced fd in the same study subjects by considering mirna dysregulation, and  to identify whether any mirna have the potential to serve as informative biomarkers of fd, thus addressing a current unmet need in the safety assessment of mmpis.

RESULTS
in vivo histopathological analysis and plasma procollagen type iii aminoterminal peptide  determination
the full range of histopathological changes observed in response to mmpi administration have been discussed in detail elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, animals receiving vehicle or mmpi for  <dig> days showed no evidence of fibrodysplastic change. one animal showed evidence of fibrodysplasia following  <dig> days  administration,  <dig> following  <dig> days administration  whilst all animals showed varying severities of fd following administration of mmpi for  <dig> or  <dig> days .

plasma procollagen type iii aminoterminal peptide  has been reported previously as a prospective biomarker of various fibrotic pathologies affecting the skin  <cit> , liver  <cit>  and heart  <cit> . plasma piiinp concentration was unaffected by mmpi administration up to  <dig> days in duration when compared to vehicle treated controls. administration of mmpi for  <dig> days resulted in elevated plasma piiinp concentrations compared with vehicle treated controls . this elevation in plasma piiinp concentration was coincident with the first histological evidence of fd and was maintained until the study end point at  <dig> days. plasma piiinp concentration was found to be highly correlated with the histopathological grade of fd in the cervical subcutaneous tissue  as determined by the pearson product–moment correlation coefficient .

global mirna profiling
an average of  <dig> , <dig> ±  <dig>  total reads with an average length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bases  were obtained from each cervical subcutaneous lesion. significant changes in mirna abundance following  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days administration of mmpi are detailed in figure 2a, and a comprehensive set of mirna expression data are included within additional file  <dig>  the number of significantly regulated mirnas relative to vehicle treated controls appeared to increase over time with the exception of animals treated for  <dig> days which exhibited more changes than those treated for  <dig> or  <dig> days . the time point at which each mirna was dysregulated are presented in the form of a 5-order venn diagram . a selection of mirna changes were validated by reverse transcriptase real-time pcr, results of which are presented in figure  <dig>  in order to explore any potential relationships between the various mirnas regulated at each time point and their potential regulatory mechanisms, results of genomic clustering analyses were obtained from mirbase v <dig> . these data describe mirnas within  <dig> kilo-bases  of each other on the canine genome, and therefore identify mirnas with the potential to be transcriptionally co-regulated. clusters of mirnas are denoted in figure 2c.

initiating events - mirna modulation following  <dig> days azm <dig> administration
despite the lack of histopathological changes in the cervical subcutaneous tissue following  <dig> days administration of azm <dig>   <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed compared to vehicle treated control animals . of these,  <dig> mirnas were found to be members of the mir- <dig> family - a collection of mirnas grouped by their functional similarities and location on the genome.

in order to explore the potential role of these mirnas in the initiation of pre-histopathological changes in response to mmpi administration, they were considered in the context of changes in the mrna environment at this time using a concatenated dataset comprising  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mrnas. the concatenated dataset was prepared by combining both mrna and mirna expression data . previous reports have suggested that the early changes in response to mmpi administration were associated with the activation of transcription factors sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig>  <cit> . the changes in mrna and mirna expression were therefore presented in the context of sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig> activation by including these transcription factors within the pathway analysis. functions of the top two scoring gene networks and associated gene network diagrams are presented in figure  <dig> , and additional file  <dig> .

four days administration of azm <dig> was associated with regulation of gene networks involved in  cancer, endocrine system disorders, reproductive system disease and  post-translational modification, protein degradation, protein synthesis. analysis of the most significant gene regulatory networks  revealed a complex interplay between several messenger rnas, transcription factors, and the dysregulated mirnas. it is noteworthy that the top regulatory network  included  <dig> out of the  <dig> differentially regulated mirnas identified at day  <dig>  and that there were extensive predicted interactions with the transcription factors sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig>  the second most significant regulatory network included many factors involved in extracellular matrix remodelling including mmps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the proteases dipeptidyl peptidase iv  and cathepsin k. of interest was the finding that mirnas  <dig>  200a*,  <dig> and  <dig>  were predicted to target sp <dig> suggesting their involvement in the negative regulation of this transcriptional regulator.

disease development and progression - mirna modulation from day  <dig> to day 17
azm <dig> administration for a duration of  <dig> days saw evidence of histological changes in the cervical subcutaneous tissue consistent with fd, however this was limited to a single animal , with the remaining  <dig> animals appearing histologically normal. in confirmation of this limited change in phenotype, this time point was associated with just  <dig> dysregulated mirnas , half of which were maintained from day  <dig> suggesting that molecular modulation at day  <dig> may be key to the initiation of fibrodysplasia. novel findings at day  <dig> included the up-regulation of cfa-mir-34c*, and the down-regulation of cfa-mir-497* and cfa-mir- <dig>  combined mirna and mrna pathway analysis  revealed that eight days administration of mmpi was associated with regulation of gene networks involved in  post-translational modification, protein degradation, protein synthesis , and  hereditary disorder, skeletal and muscular disorders, cellular development and cancer . both gene networks highlighted the involvement of transcription factors sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig>  however, mirna involvement was limited to cfa-mir-200a* which had been down-regulated previously at day  <dig> 

azm <dig> administration for  <dig> to  <dig> days was associated with an increase in histological evidence of fd in the cervical subcutaneous tissue, and in the number of significantly dysregulated mirnas . day  <dig> was associated with  <dig> dysregulated mirnas of which  <dig> had not been dysregulated at the earlier time points, and marked the appearance of cfa-mir- <dig> as the most highly expressed mirna. clustering analysis revealed that two of these mirnas were located within 10kb on canine chromosome  <dig>  combined pathway analysis  revealed that eleven days administration of azm <dig> was associated with the regulation of gene networks involved in  cellular development, embryonic development, nervous system development and function, and  cardiovascular disease, cellular movement, haematological system development and function. the most significant network highlighted an interplay between mirnas cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir-200* and cfa-mir- <dig>  the transcription factors sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig>  and marked the first elevation of transforming growth factor beta transcript . it is interesting to note the up-regulation of cfa-mir- <dig> at this time point and its potential role in the regulation of tgfβ via stat <dig> repression .

fourteen days administration of azm <dig> was associated with  <dig> dysregulated mirnas compared with vehicle treated controls. however, only three of these dysregulated mirnas were novel changes. this time point was also associated with the significant up-regulation of mir-21* . pathway analysis  revealed the most significant changes to be associated with  post-translational modification, protein folding, cell cycle and  connective tissue disorders, dermatological diseases and conditions. as with previous time points, the transcription factors sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig> were shown to interact extensively with these gene networks, but mirna involvement was not evident .

seventeen days administration of azm <dig> was associated with  <dig> dysregulated mirnas compared with vehicle treated controls, of these  <dig> were novel changes. of particular interest were pro-fibrotic mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> which were significantly up-regulated , and anti-inflammatory mir- <dig> which was significantly down-regulated. pathway analysis  revealed the most significant differential gene regulation to be associated with  amino acid metabolism, cell morphology, cellular compromise and  skeletal and muscular system development, cell to cell signalling . these gene networks centred on mirnas cfa-mir- <dig> and cfa-mir-200a* respectively, highlighting a variety of interactions between these mirnas and the dysregulated mrnas identified previously. it is interesting to note that sp <dig>  rela and stat <dig> involvement was absent at this time point   suggesting that the role of these transcription factors may be related to the initiating events in fibrodysplasia rather than disease progression.

candidate tissue-based mirna biomarkers of cervical subcutaneous fibrodysplasia
in addition to revealing the interesting possibility that mirnas may be involved in the initiation and progression of fibrodysplastic changes, the potential of these small non-coding rnas to function as tissue-based biomarkers of the incidence or severity of such changes was also investigated. raw sequencing read counts for each animal were normalised as previously described and compared with both the histological score and plasma piiinp concentration . only mirnas previously identified as significantly regulated were included in this analysis . correlation with plasma piiinp concentration was used to filter the most significant associations given that this data was continuous in nature , and has been show to correlate highly with the histopathological findings .

micrornas cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir- <dig> and cfa-mir- <dig>  were most strongly positively associated with plasma piiinp concentration . it is interesting to note that cfa-mir- <dig> and cfa-mir-21* were significantly elevated as early as day  <dig> at which point the most significant pathological changes first became apparent, and increased in expression as time progressed . all other positively correlated mirnas were only significantly elevated from day  <dig>  or day  <dig>  despite appearing to be more closely associated with plasma piiinp concentration.

moderate inverse correlations with plasma piiinp concentration were found with micrornas cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir- <dig>  cfa-mir-200c*, and cfa-mir- <dig> . microrna cfa-mir- <dig> expression was significantly decreased from  <dig> days whereas the remainder of these mirnas were first significantly decreased at day  <dig> . results of the  <dig> most highly correlated mirnas are included within table  <dig> 

correlation of mirna expression in the cervical subcutaneous tissue with plasma piiinp concentration and histological evidence of fibrodysplasia. data are r values for the top  <dig> most highly correlated mirnas. this analysis was limited to those mirnas previously identified as being significantly differentially expressed by global mirna sequencing where p<  <dig>  following fdr correction .

in order to further validate the potential of the identified mirnas as novel tissue-based biomarkers of fd, reverse transcriptase real-time mirna-pcr assays were obtained for candidate biomarkers mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  these were selected on the basis of their high level of correlation with evidence of fd, and the availability of experimentally validated assays for the canine. receiver operator curve  analysis was performed and area under the curve  values computed to ascertain the ability of each prospective biomarker to correctly identify diseased and disease-free animals  <cit> . the ability of these potential biomarkers to discriminate between the various severities of fd was not examined due to the limited number of cases in each category. microrna- <dig>  expression showed the highest level of discrimination with an auc value of  <dig> , whilst micrornas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> reported auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. as a benchmark, the classical biomarker piiinp reported an auc value of  <dig> . results of the roc analysis are presented in figure  <dig>  and ranked expression values of each biomarker and histopathological grade presented in  with the suggested cut-off values denoted by a red line.

discussion
the purpose of this study was to further explore the molecular events surrounding the initiation and progression of azm551248-induced fibrodysplasia  in the canine. a detailed histopathological report of the changes associated with fd in this study was published first in  <dig>  <cit>  and described a phased onset of fd in the cervical subcutaneous tissue following  <dig> days administration of azm <dig>  more recently, an analysis of the changes in messenger rna  expression and in mmp activity following azm <dig> administration was published  <cit> . the current manuscript builds upon previous work by investigating the role of micrornas  during the initiation of fd and furthermore, considers their potential as novel tissue-based biomarkers of fd.

of the  <dig> mirnas dysregulated at study day  <dig>   <dig> were found to be members of the mir- <dig> family which has been extensively investigated and its attenuation in expression implicated in the transition of epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype  <cit>  in various mammalian systems. epithelial to mesenchymal transition  is a biological process that allows epithelial cells to undergo various biochemical changes to assume the characteristics of a mesenchymal cell  <cit> . emt is categorised into three separate processes depending on when it occurs; type i emt occurs during embryogenesis and mediates the transition from primitive epithelia to a mesenchymal phenotype, type ii is associated with organ fibrosis  <cit>  and mediates the transition from epithelial cells to fibroblasts  <cit> , whilst type iii is linked with cancer progression and metastasis  <cit> . given the histological findings reported, and the significant down-regulation of all members of the mir- <dig> family it is plausible that mmpi administration induces type ii emt; the molecular signature of which is apparent from just  <dig> days administration. attenuation of mir- <dig> family members has been reported in various fibrotic pathologies including those of the lung  products of mir-34c and mir- <dig> respectively.

eleven days administration of azm <dig> was associated with the first histological evidence of fd and also marked the first appearance of elevated tgfβ transcript, consistent with the detection of immuno-reactive tgfβ in activated fibroblasts  <cit> , and in the plasma  <cit> . day  <dig> marked the appearance of cfa-mir- <dig> as the most highly expressed mirna. prior to this time point, mir- <dig> was detected as the most abundant mirna in the cervical subcutaneous tissue . microrna- <dig>  expression in the dermal tissues is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis  <cit> . micrornas mir-133a/b have been experimentally verified as partaking in the negative regulation of tgfβ and connective tissue growth factor  signalling during fibrosis  <cit>  and are therefore reported as "anti-fibrotic" factors. conversely, mir- <dig> is reported to have the opposite effect, stimulating tgfβ signalling by both the canonical and non canonical routes  <cit> . on balance, it appears that mir-133a/b and mir- <dig> act co-operatively to regulate tgfβ signalling, with the drive for positive regulation of tgfβ signalling by mir- <dig> overcoming the negative regulation by mir-133a/b at this time. the significant elevation of mir- <dig>  and its apparent increase coincident with the progression of fd also adds further weight to the hypothesis that mmpi induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition. the expression of mir- <dig> has been reported previously as an acquired marker of emt  <cit>  and tissue mir- <dig> expression was in fact identified as a sensitive and specific biomarker of fibrodysplastic change in this study . moreover, two further transcriptional regulators indicative of emt, snail and twist  <cit> , were also elevated at the transcript level in these study animals   <cit> .

at day  <dig>  dysregulation of three novel mirnas was noted. microrna- <dig>  has been reported to partake in the regulation of the acute inflammatory response  <cit>  which is pertinent given that marked inflammatory cell infiltration was reported in the histological findings around this study time point. the down-regulation of mir- <dig> is also of interest at this time given its repression is reported in several models of emt  <cit> . finally, this time point was also associated with the significant up-regulation of mir-21* , suggesting marked transcription of the mir- <dig> pre-mirna transcript. seventeen days administration of azm <dig> was associated with the up-regulation of pro-fibrotic mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> , and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory mir- <dig>  microrna mir- <dig> is reported to induce extracellular matrix synthesis via stimulation of the calcineurin signalling pathway  <cit> , whilst mir- <dig> is reported to induce emt by decreasing protection against mitochondrial oxidative stress  <cit> . again, these mirna changes appear to support the hypothesis of azm551248-induced emt, and the histological findings of increased ecm production.

considering all of the available data, it is apparent that several pro-emt factors including growth factors, transcriptional regulators and mirnas are modulated from as early as  <dig> days administration of the broad spectrum mmpi azm <dig>  these appear to orchestrate a sequence of signalling events resulting in the progressive development of fd. the following hypothesis is presented schematically in figure  <dig>  around the same time as the transcription factors sp <dig>  stat <dig> and rela  were found to be up-regulated , significant down-regulation of the mir- <dig> family was present. transcription factor sp <dig> is predicted to be directly targeted by the mir- <dig> family, suggesting that attenuation of the mir- <dig> family may directly contribute to the up-regulation of sp <dig> and stat <dig> . these molecular changes may also offer some explanation for the increase in tgfβ noted in response to mmpi administration. it has been shown that tgfβ- <dig> is directly targeted by mir-141/mir-200a, suggesting that attenuation of the mir- <dig> family may induce tgfβ signalling  <cit>  through reduced inhibition. this loss of mirna mediated repression would be in addition to the stimulation of tgfβ by stat <dig>  as mmpi progressed, mir- <dig> expression increased dramatically, the first significant changes being present from  <dig> days administration. microrna- <dig>  has been found to stimulate both the canonical and non-canonical tgfβ signalling pathways, offering a third route of tgfβ stimulation  <cit> .

given the apparent significance of mir- <dig> family attenuation following  <dig> days administration of mmpi, we sought clarity on how this family were themselves transcriptionally regulated. the transcription factor zeb <dig> has been shown to repress mir-200c/ <dig>  and mir-200b/200a/ <dig> promoter regions in several cancers  <cit> , at which time an inverse relationship between mir- <dig> and zeb expression was noted. moreover, bmps and tgfβ  are reported to activate zeb transcription factors  <cit>  forming a tgfβ/zeb/mir- <dig> signalling network figure 6b. of particular interest is the finding that continued expression of tgfβ leads to the hypermethylation of mir- <dig> family promoter regions. this hypermethylation is found to increase with tgfβ exposure, and results in the attenuation of mir- <dig> expression  <cit> . this finding presents a further, zeb independent method by which prolonged tgfβ expression may be self perpetuated via mir- <dig> family attenuation.

moving forward, we highlight the need to further investigate the tgfβ/zeb/mir- <dig> signalling network, and the specific interactions between mirnas and the various transcription factors discussed herein . to further study the tgfβ/zeb/mir- <dig> signalling network, we propose a series of in vitro experiments conducted in an appropriate skin cell line. the proposed system would permit the over expression of tgfβ and/or various mir- <dig> family members  and would be amenable to methylation assessment. to further elucidate the interactions between mirnas and the major transcription factors, we propose an additional in vitro experiment in which individual mirnas could be over expressed and the resulting effects on both transcription factor mrna and protein determined.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that significant attenuation of the mir- <dig> family is noted in response to mmpi administration in the canine. using global mrna and mirna data, we present a working hypothesis whereby attenuation of mir- <dig> contributes to the activation of several transcription factors including sp <dig>  stat <dig> and rela. using pathway analysis, we have suggested a link between the attenuation of the mir- <dig> family, and the appearance of tgfβ at the transcript and protein levels from day  <dig>  furthermore, we have highlighted a potential route for maintaining this tgfβ up-regulation via a tgfβ/zeb/mir- <dig> signalling network, and by the de novo reversible hypermethylation of the mir- <dig> family promoter region.
