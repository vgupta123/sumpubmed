BACKGROUND
among neurotransmitters linked to appetite control, serotonin  has a particular role: this endogenous amine is tightly involved in the regulation of feeding behavior at hypothalamic level, acting within the ventromedial and lateral nuclei  <cit> . in fact, the activity of 5-htergic raphe and hypothalamic neurons is influenced by meal macronutrient composition and insulin secretion, as suggested by the findings that the tryptophan/large neutral amino acids concentration ratio  in plasma  and 5-ht synthesis are both increased after a carbohydrate-rich meal  <cit> . the same concept applies to protein-rich meals or meals containing proteins with high tryptophan content   <cit> , demonstrating the impact of diet upon tryptophan uptake, 5-ht production and synaptic release. on the other side, glucocorticoid response influences monoamine/5-ht transmission and receptor function in the central nervous system , thus affecting feeding behavior and macronutrient choice  <cit> . these observations clearly suggest a link between stress-response, 5-ht function, weight gain and obesity. several studies indicate that obesity has, in most cases, a polygenic background  <cit> . among others, genes coding for proteins involved in 5-ht system such as the 5-ht transporter   <cit> , carriers for neutral amino acids   <cit>  and 5-ht receptor subtypes  <cit>  appear to be functionally relevant in either animal or human obesity. from diet studies conducted in rodents and humans, the interest at targeting specific 5-ht sites and, in particular, sert  <cit>  is strongly increased. structurally, sert is a glycoprotein belonging to the super-family of membrane-bound nacl-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, characterized by  <dig> putative membrane spanning domains: it promotes 5-ht clearance  from the extracellular milieu and modifies the sensitization state of 5-ht receptors within the nervous system or non-neural districts   <cit> . it is a pharmacologically active site, the target of re-uptake inhibitors as tricyclic antidepressants  and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  or 5-ht releasers like fenfluramine and  <dig> -methylenedioxy-n-methamphetamine   <cit> . both sert expression and 5-ht uptake function are finely tuned by protein-kinases activities and gene transcription which control, following cell necessities, conformational changes of the membrane-bound sert protein and/or the degree of sert partition between cytoskeleton and plasma membrane  <cit> .

data on sert expression/affinity in peripheral districts of overweight/obese subjects are currently not available. platelets are a valuable peripheral model that mimics 5-ht transport, metabolism and release in the cns, since they have been characterized for many years as a surrogate of impaired 5-ht activity in subjects with psychiatric disorders, eating behavior and ageing  <cit> . therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate human platelets sert number or affinity according to different categories of body mass index  or genders.

RESULTS
subjects’ groups
as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> individuals were recruited in the study and divided into  <dig> main bmi groups:  <dig> normal weight subjects ,  <dig> overweight ,  <dig> class i obese ,  <dig> class ii obese  and  <dig> class iii obese  individuals. anova analysis showed a significant difference among bmis of the groups , without noticeable age variations .

-paroxetine binding experiments
equilibrium saturation and scatchard analysis of -paroxetine specific binding showed a single population of high-affinity recognition sites in platelet membranes from all the subjects under investigation, clearly indicating the labeling of a single protein. the specific binding was about 90% of total binding at the kd concentration. the -paroxetine bmax  values, corresponding to sert expression in platelet membranes, were:  <dig> ±  <dig>   in nws;  <dig> ±  <dig>   in ows;  <dig> ±  <dig>   in ob-is;  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ob-iis;  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ob-iiis. the -paroxetine kd values , corresponding to the sert protein affinity state for the specific ligand, were:  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in nws;  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ows;  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ob-is;  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in ob-iis;  <dig> ±  <dig>   in ob-iiis. individual results for -paroxetine bmax and kd, obtained from the  <dig> bmi groups of subjects, are reported in figure  <dig>  anova analysis showed a significant difference between the -paroxetine bmax means of the  <dig> bmi groups ; after the post-hoc bonferroni correction test, bmax mean values were significantly reduced in ob subjects class ii-iii  vs. nws  ; bmax values were also decreased in ob-iiis respect to ows  .

correlation analyses and gender impact
among-groups differences in sert expression were additionally sustained by the significant negative correlation between -paroxetine bmax and bmi both in the whole cohort  and by gender sub-analysis in women  and men . no significant gender related differences in subjects’ variables , as well as in bmax/bmi ratio  were found , . the bmax/bmi ratio was:  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in men and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in women. no significant variation was reported in sert affinity  among the bmi based groups .

discussion
serotonin , primarily produced in cns raphe nuclei and gut, plays a wide-ranging modulatory role at the level of several homeostatic responses. in particular, cns 5-ht regulates many amongst the main individual adaptive-relational abilities to react to environmental changes, such as feeding behavior, thermoregulation, motor activity, libido, cognition, impulsivity, aggressiveness, nociception and mood. besides, 5-ht also acts on peripheral tissues and organs, modulating the immune and flogistic responses, as well as blood stem cells differentiation, hemodynamic function and intestinal peristalsis  <cit> . despite 5-ht has been extensively studied in recent years, the link between the expression of 5-ht transporter , the pivotal protein regulating its extra- and intra-cell concentrations, and human obesity has been supported by few studies. by single-photon emission tomography  analysis in midbrain areas of obese women affected by binge eating disorder , a reduction in sert density has been reported  <cit> , and this reduction was rescued by ssri therapy  <cit> .

a more recent in vivo pet study, using a iodinate tracer  in midbrain areas of monozygotic twins, has shown a higher sert density in co-twins with higher bmi  <cit> . the latter study was conducted in the finnish population,  and selected twins were prevalently women.

conversely, other pet investigations on unrelated healthy volunteers using a different sert ligand , have shown a negative correlation between cerebral sert expression and bmi  <cit> . our study clearly demonstrates a reduced sert number in platelet membranes of severely obese subjects  and a negative correlation between platelet sert bmax and bmi in human obesity. instead, the lack of significant changes in the sert affinity parameter kd suggests a comparable sert protein conformation in lean and obese individuals. all these studies substantiate the link between 5-ht activity, sert expression and weight gain, but discrepancies are present. an explanation of this discrepancy can be found putting all these data in the context of sert regulatory pathways.

as introduced before, protein sert expression is a model of “fine-tuned” regulation of membrane-bound proteins. beside undergoing a short-term up and down-regulation, sert presence in cell membranes can be long-term modulated through positive and negative signals, allowing long-lasting cell adaptation to the extracellular content of 5-ht or other related stimuli. the balance between the converging short and long-term regulatory pathways of sert defines its expression and affinity states during developmental stages, under physiological and pathological conditions.

we have previously shown that sert protein expression in platelets  is regulated by megakaryoblast cell differentiation processes  <cit> . we have also reported an up-regulated translocator protein tspo expression in discrete brain regions of ob/ob mice, without appreciable changes in sert number either in the brain or in platelets  <cit> . since leptin has been found to down-regulate sert expression  <cit> , we hypothesized that ob/ob animals, during their development, can modulate sert expression through the activation of alternative regulatory pathways, without excluding modified sert reserve and 5-ht responsiveness. in the present study, a reduced platelet sert in severe obese subjects  has been shown. this finding mirrors at the peripheral levels what previously reported in the brain  <cit> . in contrast to mutant leptin-lacking ob/ob mice, a link between human obesity, often associated with high serum leptin  <cit>  and sert regulatory cascades leading to its reduction or internalization can be hypothesized. the implications of regulatory mechanisms on reduced sert expression in obesity is indirectly supported by studies conducted on double knockout sert/brain derived neurotrophic factor   mice  <cit>  revealing the regulatory role of either other monoamine protein markers or trophic factors on 5-ht physiology and activity on body weight balance. nevertheless, currently, a clear explanation for the lower sert expression found in platelets of severe obese individuals is lacking. platelet 5-ht can be part of a network involving adipokines, cytokines and inflammatory responses  <cit> . this is supported by the report of adipocytes expressing 5-ht receptor subtypes  <cit>  and, more recently, even sert  <cit> , suggesting that adipose tissue and 5-ht system interact with each other. it is possible that the reduced sert expression is due to impaired 5-ht synthesis and activity in obese subjects  <cit> , as reported for neurotic behaviors and personality traits, and that altered sert/5-ht receptors and/or sert regulation underscore obesity. in this study, none of the recruited subjects had a present or past history of a major psychiatric disorder, but some of them could present personality traits that could be possibly linked to susceptibility to obesity  <cit> . on the other side, imbalanced appetite hormones, adipokines or gut hormones could counter-regulate sert expression.

the controversy between reduced sert expression in obese subjects and increased midbrain sert in acquired obesity, as reported in monozygotic co-twins with a higher bmi  <cit> , can be explained by different sert regulatory processes during gene-environment interactions. specifically, the selection criteria applied in the finnish study could have included higher bmi co-twins under particular lifestyles and/or changes of dietary habits leading to sert up-regulation, as observed in rodent models of acquired obesity  <cit> . at the same time, considering the experimental design of the finnish study, selected twins could also bear a genotype linked to vulnerability to stress as sert-reducing obese subjects  <cit> . moreover, of note, our investigation and that by erritzoe et al.   <cit>  much differ from the finnish study  <cit>  in terms of: a) evaluated bmi ranges; b) employed technical procedures ; c) sample size of recruited subjects.

despite the well-known gender-related differences in obesity and fat distribution, we did not found appreciable differences in bmax/bmi ratios in males vs. females, suggesting a gender-independent effect of bmi on sert expression in platelets of severe obese individuals.

CONCLUSIONS
analyzing the biggest cohort of the literature so far, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that sert density is reduced in plasma membranes of circulating platelets of severe  obese subjects, without gender-related differences. nevertheless, the complexity of sert regulation needs to be investigated further. a multivariate statistical elaboration in normal, overweight and obese subjects is currently in progress in order to better define the contribution of energy metabolism/adipocyte function on the modulation of platelet sert  in obese individuals. moreover, we suggest to better evaluate the role of 5-ht in body weight balance through the measure of other parameters such as 5-ht re-uptake function, intra-platelet/bloodstream 5-ht levels, intra-platelet sert content, plasma large-neutral amino acids, bdnf, tspo as well as the binding and sensitization state of 5-ht receptor subtypes in obese subjects. microarray gene, peptide/protein analyses and metabolomics would be helpful to identify involved signals, effectors and regulatory cascades, also in other sert expressing districts such as the gut or adipose tissue. the targeting of 5-ht-related gene/proteins and other monoamine or endocrine biomarkers would help to detect different subtypes of human obesity, possibly triggered by distinct biological causes, allowing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
