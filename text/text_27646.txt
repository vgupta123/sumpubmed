BACKGROUND
intergenic regions of bacterial chromosomes carry important functional units such as transposable elements  <cit> . small regulatory rna genes are also abundantly found in regions between protein coding genes  <cit> . in e. coli, many intergenic regions and non-coding strands of known genes are transcribed, resulting in a heterogeneous collection of rna transcripts, many of which are < <dig> nt  <cit> . bacterial intergenic chromosomal regions also carry numerous small repeat sequences that can fold into rna-type secondary structures  <cit> . some represent non-autonomous miniature inverted repeat transposable elements   <cit> . many are found immediately downstream of, or overlapping terminal codons  <cit>  and may be regulatory units  <cit> . small repeat elements carry a variety of motifs at either the dna, transcribed rna or translated protein levels and they may be engines for evolutionary change  <cit> .

borrelia burgdorferi was first isolated and shown to be the etiologic agent of lyme disease in the early 1980s  <cit> . the chromosomes of borrelia burgdorferi str. b <dig> and its related species, b. afzelii pko and borrelia garinii pb, have been sequenced, as well as many of the associated plasmids  <cit> . these organisms possess multiple plasmids. for example, b.bugrdorferi strain b <dig> has  <dig> linear plasmids and  <dig> circular plasmids  <cit> . borrelia chromosomes are small relative to many bacterial genomes, e.g., the genome of borrelia burgdorferi str. b <dig> is ~ <dig>  mb and yersinia pestis str. co <dig> genome is  <dig>  mb. borrelia chromosomes represent a tight packing of protein genes where there is little intergenic space. on the other hand, plasmids contain a much larger amount of intergenic space. these regions are known to have sequences that translate to repeat units of small peptides. in addition, they contain a high percentage of fragmented genes, including those from transposase genes, and interesting fusions of protein motifs as well as  <cit> . this shows a rapid evolutionary trend in these regions and perhaps plasmid intergenic regions are where new protein and rna genes and other functional units may evolve.

a small number of borrelia non-coding rna genes have been detected  <cit> . it has been assumed that borrelia has few small rna genes, based on comparative genomic searches for similarities to known bacterial small rna sequences  <cit> . however many regulatory rna gene sequences diverge between species, e.g., micc, micf and ryhb , and analogous genes in other species can be missed, especially between distantly related species. in some cases, such as the regulatory rna dsra, nucleotide sequences from different species show few similarities  <cit> . intergenic regions have not been further analyzed for evolutionarily conserved rna secondary structure motifs. these motifs can signal the presence of functional units.

in a bioinformatics study, we show that several repeat sequences in plasmid intergenic spaces and/or sequences immediately downstream of coding regions sustained multiple mutations, yet these sequences fold into highly conserved rna-type stem loop structures. evolutionary conservation indicates an essential role for these structures in the cell. in contrast, super family protein genes associated with some conserved rna-type structures display marked amino acid and peptide chain length differences and appear to be in a process of change and/or decay. this raises interesting questions concerning how these peptide-rna linked elements will evolve with time.

RESULTS
repeat sequences of intergenic nucleotide sequences of borrelia plasmids were analyzed for secondary structure motifs using the zuker m-fold program  <cit> . in addition, the rnaz program was used to confirm thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved rna secondary structures  <cit> . intergenic sequences from plasmids lp <dig> and lp <dig> of b. afzelii pko were completely scanned manually for repeat sequences and rna motifs. in addition, selected regions that contain relatively large intergenic regions from b. burgdorferi b <dig> and borrelia garinii pb plasmids were also scanned. most regions did not yield conserved stem loop structures, however five intergenic nucleotide sequences were found to display evolutionary conserved stem loop structures .

sequence #1
a  <dig> nt intergenic sequence  was found in nine plasmids from b. afzelii pko and b. burgdorferi b <dig>  alignment of these sequences reveals a major conserved region that is approximately at the center of the polynucleotide nucleotide chain . the embl-ebi clustalw  <dig> . <dig> multiple sequence alignment program  <cit>  was used for alignment. twenty out of  <dig> nucleotide positions show base substitutions. a comparison of sequences shows a 77–100% sequence identity between the nine plasmid sequences. sequences homologous to sequence # <dig> have not been detected in b. garinii pbi plasmids or borrelia chromosomal sequences.

rna secondary structure modeling of the nine sequences shows a high conservation of secondary structure with multiple base substitutions that maintain base pairing. in addition, a bulged u at position  <dig> is found invariant in all nine sequences. figure 2a–c depicts rna secondary structure models from three of the nine plasmid sequences. base substitutions at individual positions are depicted in figure 2c. mutations at six base-paired positions in the upper portion of the stem loop show compensatory changes that conserve the stem structure . prominent are the base pair changes at positions c14-g <dig> that result in a14-u <dig> pairing in the sequence of plasmid bb pl <dig>  and u14-a <dig> pairing in two other plasmid sequences . base pair positions  <dig> and  <dig> appear to be "hot spots" for mutations, but nevertheless, watson-crick base pairing is maintained. the c14-g47→a14-u <dig> substitution is highly significant in that it shows the double mutation, pyrimidine→purine, purine→pyrimidine. this is a transversion and has a lower probability of occurring than purine→purine and pyrimidine→pyrimidine transitions. the c-g→u-g transition at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>   are between orthologous genes in bb lp28- <dig> and ba lp60- <dig>  the base pairing at the terminal end of the stem differs between several plasmid structures . although the three a-u base pairs at the base of the stem  are conserved in all plasmid sequences, in plasmids bb lp28- <dig> and bb lp <dig>  a g56→a <dig> substitution appears to partially destabilize the base stem structure . the cut off at the  <dig> nt length for sequence # <dig> was made because sequences extended from the 5' and 3' ends do not yield additional conserved secondary structure motifs. this however does not preclude that the  <dig> nt stem loop is part of a larger functional unit that may not show prominent conserved secondary structure motifs.

sequence # <dig> was also analyzed by the rnaz bioinformatics program  <cit> , which predicts rna structures that may be evolutionarily conserved. the results as depicted on the rnaz website are shown in additional file  <dig>  the secondary structure displayed at the bottom of additional file  <dig> is identical to that depicted in figure 2c. the descriptive section at the top of the figure reveals a mean z-score of - <dig>  . the prediction is that sequences # <dig> represents evolutionarily conserved rna structures. base pairing for five individual sequences is shown in the middle section of additional file  <dig>  thus the rnaz analysis confirms the predicted evolutionary conservation of sequence # <dig> secondary structures derived manually.

in terms of nearest neighbor genes, the  <dig> nt repeat element is not located upstream or downstream of plasmid annotated genes in a consistent manner, both in terms of spacing and type of gene, although it is close to two putative transposase genes. for example, the repeat element is found  <dig> bp upstream of locus bapko_ <dig> in ba lp <dig>  this locus encodes a putative  <dig> aa transposase. in bb lp28- <dig>  it is situated  <dig> base pairs downstream of locus bb_i <dig>  which encodes a putative  <dig> aa protein. bb_i <dig> is a fragmented gene and shares the 5' end of a  <dig> aa transposase encoded by bb_h <dig> in bb lp28- <dig>  in bb lp28- <dig>  the  <dig> base pair repeat sequence overlaps the 3' end of bb_g <dig> by  <dig> bp. locus bb_g <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa hypothetical protein.

sequence #2
a second set of repeat sequences displays inverted repeats and these are found in eleven loci in ten plasmids from the three borrelia species, b. burgdorferi, b. afzelii and b. garinii. alignment of nt sequences reveals there are a significant number of base substitutions as well as insertions/and or deletions . nucleotide positions 4– <dig>  comprise inverted repeats.

rna secondary structure modeling of putative rna transcripts shows that all eleven sequences display stem loop structures which contain 11– <dig> base pairs. additional file  <dig> shows representative secondary structures and depicts several base-pair compensatory changes in the stem, e.g., a8-u <dig> pairing in b. afzelii lp <dig> changes to c8-g <dig> in b. burgdorferi lp <dig> and a5-u30→u5-a <dig> in b. burgdorferi lp28- <dig>  again, these are examples of pyrimidine→purine and purine→pyrimidine mutational transversions, and these are found between orthologs. additional base substitutions in other plasmid sequences result in g-u non-canonical pairing . the presence of non-canonical pairs implies that the conserved structure may function at the rna level as opposed to the dna level. the loop structure sustained base substitutions and insertions/deletions, which resulted in major differences in loop sequences . the stem length varies, but the invariant a4-u <dig> pair is always at the terminal end of the stem and is straddled by invariant a <dig> and a <dig> .

by bioinformatics methods, random mutations were introduced in sequence # <dig> to ascertain the probability of compensatory base pair changes arising by random base changes. for example, after adding  <dig> mutations to the  <dig> nt sequence # <dig> and initiating  <dig> trials of random mutagenesis, the stem was found disrupted  in >90% of trials, and all  <dig> trials showed a resultant decrease  in delta g, and in some cases there was a decrease by a factor of  <dig> in the delta g value. the configuration of the stem was drastically altered in  <dig> of the  <dig> trials . single base compensatory changes in the stem occurred in about 10% of trials, but at the same time the accompanying mutations  caused a partial disruption of the stem. double compensatory mutations, such as u-a → c-g and the less probable transversion, u-a → g-c, did not appear. these trials show a trend towards disruption of an ordered structure by addition of random mutations. in sharp contrast, biological mutations within  <dig> homologous sequences  display numerous base-pair compensatory changes, including transversions, show no mispairing, no stem alterations , and several insertions/deletions that were closely confined to the unpaired looped region where they do not induce changes in the stem loop configuration. strong evolutionary pressures appear to maintain the secondary structure motif of sequence # <dig> 

borrelia plasmids contain the superfamily of protein genes that encode borrelia_lipoprotein_ <dig>  <cit> . significantly, the eleven stem loop sequences are found primarily between  <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of a family of lipoprotein_ <dig> genes, as well sequences that encode fragments of lipoprotein_ <dig>  the stem loop-associated lipoprotein_1/lipoprotein_ <dig> fragment amino acid sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  the stem loop sequence in ba lp <dig> is  <dig> bp downstream of locus bapko_ <dig>  a putative lipoprotein_ <dig> gene encoding a  <dig> aa protein. on the other hand, there is no lipoprotein_ <dig> gene annotated upstream of the stem loop repeat element in bb lp <dig>  this upstream region has high nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities to lipoprotein_ <dig>  but the translated lipoprotein_ <dig> amino acid sequence contains several stop codons . with plasmid bg lp <dig>  the stem loop repeat element is located  <dig> bp from the left end  of the plasmid. thus, most of the upstream sequence of the lipoprotein_ <dig> gene would have been lost upon a putative translocation of lipoprotein_ <dig>  nevertheless, a c-terminal  <dig> aa fragment is found that is highly similar to lipoprotein_ <dig> c-terminal sequences . the bg lp <dig>  <dig> nt stem loop is  <dig> bp downstream of the 3' end of the sequence encoding the  <dig> aa c-terminal fragment. on the other hand, there is an  <dig> bp overlap of the stem loop sequence with the 3' end sequence of locus bb_h <dig> encoding a lipoprotein_ <dig> gene in bb lp28- <dig>  yet the stem loop structure is conserved with multiple base-pair compensatory changes . thus in cases where the stem loop has been detected, there is phylogenetic conservation of secondary structure and conservation of its location downstream of or partially overlapping lipoprotein_ <dig> genes/lipoprotein_ <dig> gene fragments. the high conservation of repeat element secondary structure suggests there is evolutionary pressure to maintain a subset of lipoprotein_ <dig> genes/gene fragments with downstream sequences that can fold into a stem loop structure. however, not all lipoprotein_ <dig> genes have the conserved hairpin and the stem loop may be specific to the subset of lipoprotein- <dig> genes outlined above. for example, locus bapko_ <dig> in ba lp <dig> encodes a putative 261aa lipoprotein_ <dig>  which does not have the characteristic stem loop.

sequence #3
borrelia sp. encode the virulence factor termed complement regulator-acquiring surface protein  <dig>   <cit> . this protein binds factor h, resulting in inhibition of complement activation in mammals. crasp- <dig> proteins from b. afzelii lp <dig> and other borrelia species plasmids have been isolated and their properties characterized  <cit> .

multiple copies of sequences analogous to crasp- <dig> genes have been detected in borrelia plasmids. these include sequences in loci bapko_2065- bapko_ <dig> from b. afzelii lp <dig> . a comparison shows that the translated aa sequence from ba lp <dig> locus bapko_ <dig> and the aa sequence derived experimentally from the ba lp <dig> crasp- <dig> protein  are almost identical and show only  <dig> aa changes out of  <dig> aa. in addition, the factor h binding motif, 232kdldsfnp <dig> is present in locus bapko_ <dig> and the ba lp <dig> crasp- <dig> mmsa <dig> gene . bapko_ <dig> and ba lp <dig> mmsa <dig>  probably are paralogous genes and the bapko_2065- <dig> superfamily are also paralogs resulting from gene duplication. however an amino acid sequence alignment of this family of loci shows several major insertions/deletions and amino acid substitutions . the bottom figure in additional file  <dig> shows a phylogram of this gene family.

alignment of nucleotide sequences immediately downstream of open reading frame stop codons from bapko_ <dig> to bapko_ <dig> and crasp- <dig> genes from bg lp <dig> zqa <dig> and ba lp <dig> mmsa <dig>  shows that these sequences are highly conserved . secondary structure modeling of putative transcripts of downstream sequences show two stem loop structures . stem loop # <dig> is highly conserved with numerous base pair compensatory changes, but it also has a 3' terminal oligouridine. it probably represents a rho-independent transcription termination site for crasp- <dig> and related putative gene transcripts. stem loop  <dig> is present in all repeat sequences but shows variations in secondary structure . the significance of this stem loop is unknown, but it may reside within a putative 3'utr region. the high conservation of the stem loop  <dig> secondary structure contrasts with the variability in overall amino acid sequence, differences in factor h binding site sequence  and peptide chain length of associated protein genes .

sequence #4
sequence # <dig>  is  <dig> nt and has an inverted repeat segment . this sequence is not located near any protein genes. it is  <dig> bp downstream of locus bapko_ <dig>  which encodes an oligopeptide abc transporter, and  <dig> bp upstream of bapko_ <dig>  a putative lipoprotein gene. sequence # <dig> from ba lp <dig> is highly conserved in bg lp <dig>  but only a part of the sequence is conserved in bb lp <dig> . comparison of positions 52– <dig> show less than 40% similarity between sequences of bb lp <dig> and ba lp <dig>  a comparison and analysis of sequence # <dig> and flanking regions in plasmid bb lp <dig> shows that the  <dig> bp sequence has been recombined in the opposite orientation . this resulted in a major change in sequence between bb p <dig> and ba lp <dig> and bg lp <dig> downstream of position  <dig> . the approximate 5' half of the sequences are very similar due to the inverted repeat, which provides a similar sequence in the opposite orientation.

secondary structure models of the  <dig> nt sequence reveal that a structural motif is conserved between the three sequences . the three models display two stem loops and one small stem . stem loop  <dig> consists of the inverted repeat and has  <dig> contiguous watson-crick base pairs . the sequence in bb  <dig> is not a perfect inverted repeat but there are base compensatory changes that maintain the  <dig> watson-crick base pairs, i.e., there are two g-c pairs in bb lp <dig> in place of two non canonical g-u pairs in ba lp  <dig> and bg lp <dig>  the presence of stem loop  <dig> is of major significance in that it is in a region with very low nt sequence identity, yet a similar stem loop is maintained but with extensive differences in base pairing . this type of phylogenetically conserved motif is characteristic of secondary structural properties of some small non-coding rnas, where secondary structure and not necessarily sequence is conserved, e.g., see  <cit> . this conservation implies a functional importance for this  <dig> nt sequence, which may represent a non-coding rna.

sequences #5
sequence # <dig> is  <dig> nt in length and is found in plasmids of three borrelia species, ba lp <dig> from b. afzelii pko, bb lp <dig> from b. burgdorferi str. b <dig> and bg lp <dig> in b. garinii pb. this sequence is highly conserved with nt sequence identities > 95% between the three sequences. the sequence at positions 14913– <dig> from b. burgdorferi b <dig> plasmid lp <dig> represent a perfect inverted repeat. secondary structure modeling shows the presence of three stem loops in all three plasmid sequences. the structure from bb lp <dig> is shown in additional file  <dig>  it is highly stable thermodynamically with a delta g of - <dig>  kcal/mol. a comparison of different plasmid structures shows three base substitutions in stem  <dig> that maintain the base-pairing, but two other substitutions produce a-a and a-g non-canonical pairs . stem  <dig> is not destabilized, but there are small decreases in the delta g value to - <dig>  kcal/mol  and - <dig>  kcal/mol . in the context of surrounding base pairs, non-canonical pairs such as a-a and a-g are present in rna double helices  <cit>  and have been found to contribute to rna stem double helical conformations  <cit> .

an analysis of sequence # <dig> by the rnaz bioinformatics program shows a predicted evolutionarily conserved rna structure with a mean z-value of - <dig>  .

sequence # <dig> is immediately downstream of loci bapko_ <dig>  bga_ <dig> and bb_a <dig>  these loci represent highly conserved proteins that have been annotated as hypothetical proteins. however they have amino acid sequence and putative protein domain similarities to a plasmid partition protein  when analyzed by pfam  <cit> . the aa sequence identity to pf- <dig> is 55% as determined by the expasy proteomics server  <cit> . although the sequence # <dig> stem loops reveal an interesting highly stable structure that is linked to a conserved protein, additional sequences homologous to sequence # <dig> would be needed to further support a proposed phylogenetic conservation of secondary structure.

discussion
in genomes of many bacterial species, intergenic regions are found to be rich in repeat elements such as mites  <cit> , other small nucleotide sequence repeats  <cit>  and small non-coding rna genes  <cit> . here we analyzed intergenic plasmid regions from three species of borrelia and have detected intergenic sequences that can fold into conserved rna secondary structures. compelling evidence for evolutionary conservation comes from comparisons of homologous sequences, where numerous base-pair changes are found to maintain stem loop structures. these stem loops are specific to plasmid sequences, and none have been detected in borrelia chromosomes or in sequences from other bacterial species.

two rna-motifs associated with super families of protein genes  show a high conservation of secondary structure between homologs, yet these gene families show extensive amino acid substitutions and deletions/insertions. perhaps the cell maintains these rna motifs as reservoirs and as potential functional units in the formation of new variant proteins. a major focus in future work should be to determine if variant crasp- <dig> and lipoprotein- <dig> loci are translated.

sequence # <dig> contains inverted repeats and is located less than  <dig> bp downstream of putative lipoprotein_ <dig> genes, and in one case overlaps the terminal codon sequences. this is very similar to the location of several miniature inverted repeats, the mites that are present in other bacterial species. these inverted repeats are also found downstream of genes, and in some cases are found to overlap c-terminal codons  <cit> . in yersinia, genes situated upstream of mites appear to be regulated by these inverted repeat elements, which are transcribed into rna  <cit> . although sequence # <dig> differs from bacterial mites in not having a large nucleotide segment between inverted repeats, the proximity of this sequence to c-terminal coding ends of genes is similar to that of several mites.

borrelia contains transposase genes that are found in other bacterial species  <cit> . some plasmids show a high percentage of transposase-specific nucleotide sequences which may not be evident from gene annotations, e.g., the first ~ <dig> bp of the left side of b. afzelii pko plasmid lp <dig> starting at nucleotide position  <dig> consists entirely of transposase-related sequences . there may also be non-autonomous transposable elements present in borrelia that are moved and replicated by transposases. as many other bacteria contain these elements  <cit> , it would not be surprising if borrelia had its own set of non-autonomous small transposable elements, possibly with their own specific signatures. repeat sequence # <dig> described above should be further analyzed for a possible relationship to bacterial mites.

stem loops that are proximal to protein genes have been reported before. dunn et al  <cit>  described two inverted repeat sequences in tandem with perfect base paired stems in b. burgdorferi in circular plasmid cp <dig> . the hairpins are adjacent to putative - <dig> promoter sequences of an open reading frame. also, an inverted repeat sequence is found in the 5' flanking region of the bba <dig>  gene in b. burgdorferi  <cit> . however the above sequences, which are upstream of genes in promoter regions, are unrelated to those reported here.

stem loop  <dig>  from sequence # <dig> is downstream of the crasp-1-related genes and appears to have classic rho-independent termination signatures in terms of size and oligo u tail. the adjacent stem loop  <dig> may be part of a putative 3' utr of crasp- <dig> and crasp-1-related proteins. functions can not presently be assigned, but it should be noted that some small rnas in e. coli represent 3' utr transcripts which show different expression levels from associated mrnas and may have independent functions  <cit> . sequences # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> appear to have typical rna signatures with long stem loops and bulged/looped positions. without further characterization, functional roles cannot be assigned. but of particular interest is the conservation of the bulged u at position  <dig> of the sequence # <dig> stem loop. many rna secondary structures display conserved bulged positions and these have functional roles in rna/rna interactions  <cit> . sequence # <dig> does not appear to be linked to any protein genes and is present in nine different plasmids. this poses the question of how it was transferred and why the sequence is duplicated. interestingly, sequence # <dig> is found in three different species, b. burgdorferi str. b <dig>  b. afzelii pko and b. garinii pb but in only one copy number. thus this rna motif may provide an essential function in borrelia, as it is found in all three species. once complete genome sequences of other borrelia species are determined, it would be of interest to see if sequence # <dig> and/or its characteristic secondary structural model is also present in these species.

only a limited number of plasmids have been analyzed for repeat sequences that fold into rna motifs, but a more comprehensive search is necessary to assess their abundance. experimental rna analyses such as northern blots needs to be done to determine if these sequences are transcribed, but in view of the strong evidence for evolutionary conservation of secondary structure, they may function at the rna level. in e. coli, many intergenic sequences are transcribed, which results in the presence of a large number of heterogeneous small rnas  <cit> . these elements also have not been analyzed for function.

CONCLUSIONS
small repeat sequences of borrelia sp. linear plasmids show numerous changes in nucleotide sequence, nevertheless, rna-type motifs generated by these variable sequences are highly conserved evolutionarily. two of the motifs may be candidates for non-coding rnas. two others appear linked to c-terminal ends of super families of protein genes/pseudogenes, but these genes display major changes in amino acid sequence and peptide chain length. jacob monod described evolutionary change in terms of "tinkering", a trial and error process in formation of new or modified genes with random mutations and/or random fusion of motifs  <cit> . perhaps the variable super family virulence protein gene sequences show elements of "tinkering", however the interesting question is why the rna motifs, which have also sustained mutations are well conserved when at least some of the associated protein genes are in a process of change or decay. we have mentioned the possibility of these being reservoirs for formation of variant or new proteins.
