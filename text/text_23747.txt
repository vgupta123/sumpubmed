BACKGROUND
soybean  is one of the most important crops in the world. at present, one of the major diseases affecting soybean production is asian soybean rust , which results from infection with phakopsora pachyrhizi  <cit> . under conditions that are favorable for fungal propagation, infection results in yield losses ranging from  <dig> to 80%  <cit> .

three infection types have been described on soybean accessions inoculated with p. pachyrhizi:  susceptible reaction characterized by “tan” lesions with many uredinia and prolific sporulation;  resistant reaction typified by reddish brown lesions with few uredinia and little to moderate sporulation; and  resistant reaction with no visible lesions or uredinia, conferring the immune phenotype  <cit> . six single dominant genes  conditioning soybean resistance and/or immunity to p. pachyrhizi have been identified so far  <cit> . the effectiveness of these genes is limited through virulent asr isolates that are able to overcome the resistance mechanism conferred by each of them  <cit> . for this reason, the most successful method to control fungal spread is the application of fungicides, which are costly and have a negative impact on the environment, favor a selection of pathogen resistance and, in severe cases, are ineffective  <cit> . in this context, understanding the molecular basis of the soybean defense against fungal infection and growth, identifying genes involved in susceptible or resistant response and characterizing their individual roles are key steps for engineering durable and quantitative disease resistance. therefore, genetic transformation represents a powerful tool for functional studies.

many studies have implicated a role for soybean wrky transcription factors in the response to p. pachyrhizi infection  <cit> . wrky genes might regulate the expression of defense genes, modulating immediate downstream target genes or activating/repressing other transcriptional factors  <cit> .

wrky transcription factors comprise one of the largest families of regulatory proteins in plants. previous studies have identified  <dig> wrky-encoding genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , approximately  <dig> members in rice  <cit> ,  <dig> in poplar  <cit> ,  <dig> in brachypodium distachyon  <cit> ,  <dig> in grape  <cit>  and  <dig> and  <dig> genes in two different species of cotton  <cit> . a genome-wide analysis in primitive eukaryotes  <cit>  revealed the widespread occurrence of wrky proteins.

the most prominent feature of these proteins is the wrky domain, which is a highly conserved  <dig> amino acid region hallmarked by the heptapeptide wrkygqk followed by a c2h2- or c2hc zinc-finger motif. as deduced from the results of a nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of a wrky domain of atwrky <dig>  the conserved wrkygqk sequence is directly involved in dna binding  <cit> , but the zinc finger motif is also required  <cit> . most of the well-characterized wrky proteins bind to the w-box element tgac in the promoter region of the target genes  <cit> . the specificity of the binding site is partly dependent on the dna sequences adjacent to the w-box core, and the involvement of wrky factors in protein complexes might be the major criteria in determining promoter selectivity  <cit> .

the identification of  <dig> wrky genes expressed in various soybean tissues and in response to abiotic stress was previously assessed using rt-pcr  <cit> . however, due to the unavailability of the complete soybean genome sequence at that time, the number of members of this gene family was underrepresented. yin et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> wrky members in soybean genome. now a day, several databases for soybean genome analysis are publicly available. planttfdb  <cit>  soydb  <cit>  and soytfkb  <cit>  are transcription factor databases which contain valuable information, including protein sequence, protein domains, predicted tertiary structures and links to external databases. however, despite the usefulness, these databases have performed systematic annotations resulting in different numbers of soybean wrky transcription factors and some incorrect gene models. so, until now, there is no a comprehensive curate list of soybean wrky genes. besides, there is inconsistent nomenclature for soybean wrky members in the literature. the phytozome database  assigns names from arabidopsis orthologs, while zhou et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> soybean wrky genes  and randomly assigned a number to each gene. moreover, studies of the individual genes  <cit>  have assigned numbers different from those proposed by zhou et al.  <cit> . the present study reports a genome-wide annotation of the wrky family in soybean and a functional analysis of some genes involved in response to p. pachyrhizi infection.

the proteins were assigned to three major groups and subgroups in accordance with eugelm et al.  <cit> . group i, ii and iii contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> soybean wrky genes, respectively . a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were assigned to subgroups iia, iib, iic, iid and iie, respectively.

although the wrkygqk signature was highly conserved in the soybean wrkys,  <dig> proteins with amino acid substitutions in the signature of the c-terminal domain were identified. these variant proteins were distributed among all groups, except subgroup iid. wrkygkk was the most common variant and was shared by  <dig> genes. other atypical sequences, such as wrkygek, wrkyedk, wkkygqk, crkygqk and whqyglk, occurred in single proteins. nine wrky proteins contained incomplete and/or amino acid substitutions in the zinc-finger sequence . some of these proteins contained patterns of zinc-finger motifs that have not been reported in the literature. expression was detected for nine genes presenting modifications in the wrky signature and for six genes with modifications in the zinc-finger motif, indicating that these genes might be functional. moreover, another highly conserved domain, the zinc cluster, was identified upstream of the wrky domain in iid gene members.

the phylogenetic approach performed with the wrky domain sequences confirmed the division of gmwrky members in the five groups  . these groups correspond to the wrky domain classification  that has already been demonstrated in other studies. genes from group iia are closely related with those from group iib, while genes from group iid are closely related with those from group iie.figure  <dig>

some of the genes that presented differential expression profiles in response to the fungus were randomly selected from each classification group for more detailed analyses. gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig>  were differentially expressed in three of the four experiments, while gmwrky <dig> , gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig>  in the two microarrays. gmwrky <dig> , gmwrky <dig> , gmwrky <dig>  were also analyzed because they were closely related to at least one of the genes evaluated above. interestingly, none of these genes was expressed in rust infection lesions at ten days after fungus inoculation .

the differential expression of these genes was confirmed using rt-qpcr. the transcript levels during the course of fungus infection in a resistant genotype  and in a susceptible genotype  were compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants .figure  <dig>

genes in leaves of three-week-old soybean plants infected with
p. pachyrizi. the gene response in susceptible  and resistant  genotypes during p. pachyrizi infection  was evaluated using rt-qpcr. mock-inoculated plants were used as a control. the values  were calculated based on three biological replicates and four technical replicates. multifactorial analysis of three factors  was highly significant: gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> p =  <dig> ; gmwrky <dig> p =  <dig> ; gmwrky <dig> p =  <dig> . the means indicated with the same letters in the same cultivar and treatment did not differ significantly . lower case letters were used to identify differences among inoculated embrapa- <dig> plants and capital letters were used to identify differences among inoculated pi <dig> plants. f-box protein and metalloprotease reference genes were used as internal controls to normalize the amount of mrna present in each sample. transcript levels of wrky genes present in mock-inoculated plants were used to calculate transcript accumulation in the inoculated plants.



the interaction among the genotypes, time-course and pathogen presence was highly significant . in the inoculated plants, the eight genes showed early expression in pi <dig>  compared with embrapa  <dig> . in the embrapa  <dig>  the expression peaks were higher at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hai, while in pi <dig>  these peaks varied from one to  <dig> hai. furthermore, gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> presented a stronger response in the resistant genotype. interestingly, the homologous genes  did not overlap with their expression peaks in the resistant genotype. gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> showed higher expression levels at one hai followed by a decrease in expression, whereas gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> presented higher transcript levels at  <dig> hai.

gmwrky <dig> overexpression and silencing in soybean plants
gmwrky <dig> was selected for further functional characterization because it was one of the genes that showed differential expression in different experiments. furthermore, it was also shown that this gene is involved in different abiotic stresses  <cit> . to determine the functional role of the gmwrky <dig> in response to p. pachyrhizi infection, soybean somatic embryos were transformed to obtain gene overexpression and silencing. in the overexpression experiments, gfp expression was detected in hygromycin-resistant globular embryos . the histodifferentiated embryos of nine independent transgenic lines  were obtained. the presence of the t-dna in the embryo genomes was confirmed using pcr, and the gmwrky <dig> expression was significantly higher in the embryos of the four independent transgenic lines . however, the development of transgenic embryos overexpressing gmwrky <dig> was not successful. as a consequence, those embryos were not able to develop into plants.

for gene silencing, a vector carrying a 176-bp inverted-repeat fragment sequence from gmwrky <dig> was constructed. this fragment shared 83% similarity with the homologous region of gmwrky <dig> and 70% and 67% similarity with gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> respectively. these data confirm the close relationship among the genes, which was also observed in the phylogenetic analysis . this high sequence similarity suggests that the silencing construct would target the four genes.

a more detailed structural analysis of the four homologous genes showed that the wrkygqk signature, zinc-finger motif and other residues in the sequences were highly conserved among the four corresponding proteins . the sequence identity of the complete proteins varied from 66% to 94% . the four soybean genes were putative orthologs of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> arabidopsis genes, as shown in the phylogenetic tree . the gene structure of gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> was similar, with the wrky domain present in the fourth exon . interestingly, gmwrky <dig> had four alternative transcripts, and one of the transcripts lacked the wrky domain.figure  <dig>

two independent transgenic lines  carrying the silencing construct were obtained. the molecular analysis revealed that one of the repeats  was eliminated from the first line. therefore, the post-transcriptional silencing was not triggered, which was confirmed using rt-qpcr . in the second transgenic line  the complete cassette was successfully integrated . as anticipated, the results from the rt-qpcr analysis showed that the expression of the four homologous genes was significantly reduced . the transgenic line exhibited no major phenotypic alterations.figure  <dig>

discussion
soybean wrky genes
whole genome sequencing  <cit>  has facilitated the accurate annotation of soybean gene families. in this study, we present the annotation of  <dig> wrky transcription factors in soybean. the transcripts of  <dig> genes were detected, suggesting they can be expressed at the protein level; however, specific conditions might be necessary for the successful transcription of the remaining genes.

as discussed before, there is inconsistent nomenclature for soybean wrky members in the literature. to unify the terminology, we proposed a nomenclature based on the previously described wrky-encoding genes  <cit> , with some modifications. data from sequence comparisons have shown that gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> is the same gene. in addition, gmwrky <dig> does not exist in the soybean genome; indeed, this sequence represents a chimeric transcript produced through trans-splicing between n-terminal and c-terminal sequences from glyma02g <dig> and glyma14g <dig>  respectively. the remaining  <dig> genes were numbered according to the order of the chromosomes .

more wrky genes have been identified in soybean than in other species, such as rice, arabidopsis, cotton, grape and b. distachyon  <cit> . the duplication events have been greatly over-retained, specifically in the case of transcription factors  <cit> . thus, functional redundancy is a common feature in plant species. however, homologous genes might diverge in function providing a source of evolutionary novelty  <cit> .

the phylogenetic approach used in this study allowed the division of the soybean wrky genes in the five groups previously reported  <cit> .

in soybean, the members of group i contained domains with a c2h2-type zinc-finger motif. the same characteristic is observed in arabidopsis, while in rice, the wrky domains of group i members include two types of zinc-finger motifs: c2h <dig> and c2hc  <cit> .

although the wrkygqk signature was highly conserved among soybean wrky proteins, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  variation was identified in  <dig> genes. zhou et al.  <cit>  previously showed that gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig>  contain the variant wrkygkk rather than the conserved wrkygqk motif. slight variations in this region have also been reported in arabidopsis, rice, tobacco, barley, canola and sunflower  <cit> . compared with arabidopsis, which contains four wrkygkk variants, the number of genes with a modified wrkygqk motif is greater in soybean.figure  <dig> 
conservation analysis of the consensus sequence of the wrkygqk domain. analysis of the  <dig> soybean wrky genes identified was performed using the meme suite. the overall height in each stack indicates the sequence conservation at each position. the height of each residue letter is proportional to the relative frequency of the corresponding residue. amino acids are colored according to their chemical properties: green for polar, non-charged, non-aliphatic residues , magenta for the most acidic residues , blue for the most hydrophobic residues , red for positively charged residues , pink for histidine , orange for glycine , yellow for proline  and turquoise for tyrosine .



some unusual gmwrky-encoding genes  produced mrna . further analyses are necessary to determine whether these genes function as transcription factors or if they induce post-transcriptional regulation through rnai, as previously suggested  <cit> . variant proteins might have abolished or decreased capacities to bind to the w-box  <cit> . it has been suggested that wrky proteins without the canonical wrkygqk motif might have different binding sites  <cit> , target genes and possibly divergent roles  <cit> .

functional analysis
despite the fact that the identification or prediction of many wrky genes from different species has been previously achieved, only a small number of these have been functionally characterized. information concerning the role of soybean genes  during abiotic stress has been based on data obtained from heterologous expression systems  <cit> . the data from expression analyses  <cit>  or using transient gene silencing  <cit>  supports a role for the wrky genes in response to biotic stresses. studies concerning global expression profiling have demonstrated the importance of wrky-encoding genes in transcriptional reprogramming during p. pachyrhizi infection in soybean plants  <cit> .

to determine which soybean wrky genes are involved in plant defense against p. pachyrhizi infection, we performed a series of analyses to examine their expression patterns after infection. we initially compared the microarray data available in the literature  <cit>  with the results obtained from two additional experiments: supersage and rna-seq. many genes were differentially expressed in only one library, while a few of them showed differential expression in more than one library. the modulation in the transcript levels of eight genes was validated, showing the reliability of data mining. the similar expression patterns in response to p. pachyrhizi infection was observed among closely related genes , such as gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig> , gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig> , gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  and gmwrky <dig> . this similar expression pattern suggests that these genes might share similar functions in disease resistance. the redundant function of gmwrky genes might be beneficial in protecting the cell or organism under various stress conditions and eliciting multiple pathways that lead to the wide array of physiological responses that occur following pathogen infections  <cit> .

global expression data have suggested that the timing and the degree of induction of the defense pathway are determinants for the induction of soybean resistance to p. pachyrhizi  <cit> . in our study, the induced expression of gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> in response to p. pachyrhizi was earlier and/or stronger in the resistant genotype. the expression of most genes analyzed peaked at  <dig> hai in the resistant genotype; therefore, we propose that these genes might be involved in non-specific defense responses. van de mortel et al.  <cit>  and schneider et al.  <cit>  reported that p. pachyrhizi infections induce biphasic global expression. gene expression initially peaked at  <dig> hai, which corresponded with the early infection processes of appressoria formation and epidermal cell penetration. the authors suggested that this peak corresponded to a non-specific defense response similar to pathogen-triggered immunity. a second phase of gene expression, which began at  <dig> hai and continued until  <dig> hai, is coincident with haustoria formation and effector protein secretion. the authors suggested that this response is consistent with the activation of rpp <dig> and rpp3-mediated resistance. it has been shown that gene expression is rapid and increased in the incompatible interaction  <cit> .

the closely related genes gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> are putative orthologues of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> arabidopsis genes. in both species, these genes were classified into group iia. the three arabidopsis wrkys are involved in stress responses, which include resistance against the bacteria pseudomonas syringae and fungus botrytis cinerea  <cit> . atwrky <dig> is a salicylic acid-induced gene that positively regulates sar  <cit>  and modulates pr gene expression; atwrky <dig> overexpression increases resistance to p. syringae  <cit> . atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> proteins antagonize atwrky <dig> during p. syringae infection. the gain or loss of gene function in single, double or triple combination mutants resulted in increased susceptibility to b. cinerea  <cit> . some rice, barley and brassica napus wrky members from group iia are also involved in the response to fungal and bacterial pathogens, as demonstrated using expression studies. oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> are upregulated in magnaporthe grisea infected-leaves and downregulated in xanthomonas oryzae-inoculated leaves  <cit> . hvwrky <dig> and hvwrky <dig> play an important role in response to blumeria graminis infection  <cit> , and bnwrky <dig> and bnwrky <dig> play a role in the response to sclerotinia sclerotiorum and alternaria brassicae infections  <cit> .

most available information concerning soybean gene function is based on data obtained from heterologous expression systems. however, as the activity of many proteins frequently depends on specific interactions that are only found in homologous backgrounds, the present study was based on a homologous expression system. an rna interference approach was used for the silencing of four soybean homologous genes . the quadruple silencing is an advantage because a single knockout of transcription factors rarely results in altered phenotypes due to functional redundancy among closely related members  <cit> . the transgenic rnai line used in this study generated a significant reduction in the transcript levels of the four target genes. when infected with p. pachyrhizi, the transgenic line showed increased susceptibility to the fungus. taken together, the results strongly suggest that at least one of the four genes might be involved in the soybean resistance phenotype.

pandey et al.  <cit>  silenced  <dig> soybean wrkys individually using virus-induced gene silencing  to test their involvement in rpp2-mediated resistance against p. pachyrhizi infection. three of these genes  compromised the resistance phenotype when silenced. phenotypic alterations were not evidenced when gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> genes were individually silenced. however, in the present study, an increased susceptibility to p. pachyrhizi infection was observed in the quadruple-silenced  line, suggesting that this phenotype is a consequence of gmwrky <dig> and/or gmwrky <dig> silencing. moreover, the four genes analyzed in this study could also play a synergistic role in the pathogenic defense response.

a previous study showed that gmwrky <dig> is also strongly induced under conditions of drought and salt stress in the soybean  <cit> . altogether, these data suggest that this gene is probably involved in a non-specific response that occurs upstream of biotic and abiotic stress defense routes, in contrast with the specific rpp2-response of the genes identified by pandey et al.  <cit>  in response to the fungal infection.

gmwrky <dig> was selected for use in the overexpression study. histodifferentiated embryos overexpressing this gene were obtained from four independent transformation experiments. however, the plants were not recovered. the most likely explanation is that the constitutive overexpression of the gmwrky <dig> might affect the regeneration of plants. the use of constitutive promoters in investigation of genes whose constant overexpression has deleterious effects on the plant is a major limitation  <cit> . chen and chen  <cit>  reported that high levels of atwrky <dig> cause severe abnormalities in plant growth. even at moderate levels, the individual or combinatorial overexpression of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> leads to the development of smaller plants or death shortly after germination  <cit> .

the deleterious effect of the excessive production of these wrkys during plant growth suggested that the expression of this gene might require proper regulation during the activation of plant defense responses. however, in healthy plants, the expression of these genes is negatively regulated, as demonstrated by chen and chen  <cit>  for the atwrky <dig> 

to a certain extent, the lethality problems observed in this study could be partially overcome using tissue-specific, developmentally regulated or inducible promoters. although the number of tissue-specific promoters has increased in recent years, soybean leaf-specific promoters are still unavailable.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study,  <dig> wrky transcription factors were annotated in soybean. seventy-five genes were identified as involved in the soybean response to p. pachyrhizi infection based on transcriptional regulation. the participation of four genes in response to pathogen infection was demonstrated using an rnai approach. further investigations are required to provide clues regarding the functions of the individual genes. the results contribute to the elucidation of gene function and suggest the manipulation of wrkys as a strategy to increase fungal resistance in soybean plants.
