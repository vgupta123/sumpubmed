BACKGROUND
functional, non-coding, genomic sequences carry out important cellular functions. these sequences can include enhancers and silencers, regulating gene expression, and non-coding rnas . ncrnas have been implicated in a variety of biological functions including chromatin modification , transcription  <cit> , and rna splicing  <cit> , editing  <cit> , and translation  <cit> . despite the increasing evidence of their importance the tools available for the detection of functional non-coding elements in a genome, in contrast to the array of tools available to identify coding sequences, are limited. this is largely due to the wide range of non-coding elements and the lack of characteristic features to assist in their identification.

current computational methods to identify ncrnas; such as mfold  <cit> , rnafold  <cit> , and rnaz  <cit> , rely on formation of secondary structure, or combine this approach with comparative sequence analysis . the formation of secondary structures is a feature of many ncrnas including; small nucleolar rnas, trnas, and micrornas; but many ncrnas and non-coding regulatory sequences will be missed using this approach.

conservation of sequence between species is widely used as an indicator of function. conservation can be identified using a sliding window analysis applied to whole-genome alignments. this technique involves counting the number of matches/mismatches in overlapping windows of a predetermined length, to obtain a profile of conservation level across the sequence. many previous studies have used such analyses to identify conserved non-coding sequences in human and other genomes . two key findings have emerged from these studies. firstly, there is strong evidence, both computational and experimental, that conserved non-coding sequences are highly enriched in regulatory sequences, especially regulatory element binding sites . a second finding is that conserved non-coding sequence is selectively located near transcription factors and genes involved in development and the nervous system .

sliding window analyses have several limitations. a smaller window allows for more precise localisation of changes in the property of interest but also allows for noise within the sequence to more significantly affect the output. thus sliding window analysis is inherently a compromise between these two factors  <cit> . the technique also fails to precisely localise boundaries in functional elements, such as the boundaries between exons and introns, the ends of transcription factor binding sites , and the transcription start sites of expressed rnas, for which more sophisticated segmentation methods are required  <cit> . the second disadvantage is the common consideration of conservation as a dichotomy , whereas in reality the constraints on any given region will differ resulting in multiple classes of conservation within a genome. for example, analysis of genome alignments from drosopholids and mammals identified  <dig> and  <dig> evolutionary rate classes respectively  <cit> . as a result it is not possible to set threshold values for conserved elements that will consistently identify non-coding functional elements.

to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages we performed an analysis using changept, a bayesian segmentation model  <cit> . adopting a bayesian approach is beneficial as it provides quantification of the uncertainties in parameter estimates in the form of probability distributions. the changept model can be described as a segmentation-classification model, which is capable of simultaneously segmenting a genomic alignment and classifying segments into one of a predefined number of segment classes. segments are classified according to multiple sequence characteristics including level of evolutionary conservation between species, gc content and transition/transversion ratio, and precise boundaries for the segments are identified.

using changept, we carried out a genome-wide analysis using an automated alignment of the zebrafish, mouse, and human genomes. it is possible to apply changept to an alignment of a large number of species, using one of the alignment encodings introduced in  <cit> . however, these encodings focus on the conservation properties of the alignment only. alignments contain additional information indicative of function, including variations in gc content and in transition/transversion ratio. here we consider an alignment of only three species, so that we can use encodings that capture this additional information  <cit> . we chose zebrafish and mouse genomes as these are potentially useful model organisms for future investigations of functional significance.

we identified  <dig> intronic putative functional elements  distributed among  <dig> zebrafish genes and compared these to predictions from other approaches and to sequence databases. using analysis of sequence conservation we identified many elements that had previously been identified using secondary structure analysis, and some novel elements. we also identified that the pfes were highly enriched in transcription factors. to examine if there were conserved elements between different members of the same pathway and the effects of optimised local alignments, we performed a pathway-focussed analysis on  <dig> genes involved in muscle development, identifying a similar enrichment in transcription factors and that conservation rates not only vary across the genome but also within a single gene. we identified  <dig> pfes in genes in the myogenesis pathway that belong to the class of most highly conserved segments. we validated our findings experimentally, confirming the expression of these intronic elements in zebrafish embryos.

RESULTS
to identify putative functional non-coding elements conserved between human, mouse and zebrafish, we performed a genome-wide analysis using the readily available multiz 8-way alignment. for each zebrafish chromosome, a zebrafish-referenced 3-way alignment was extracted, giving  <dig> alignments in total. approximately 4–5% of each chromosome was aligned, however this captured 50% of the ensembl genes.

identification of conserved non-coding elements
to search for the most conserved elements in each gene, changept was applied to each chromosome alignment independently. alignments were segmented into classes, based on conservation rates, and with the number of classes determined set to be the minimum number that could be fitted to the data. for each class the posterior probability that each sequence position belongs to the class was determined and visualised in context using bed files uploaded to the ucsc genome browser.

we identified significant variation between genes on the same chromosome in the levels of conservation. we therefore used a gene-specific approach, identifying for each gene the class or classes containing exons and examining these, and more highly conserved classes, for intronic elements. notably, there are regions within the introns that show equally distinct boundaries and probabilities of belonging to the highly conserved classes as exons, and some intronic regions that are more conserved than coding regions .fig.  <dig> 
a most conserved segment classes of lrba gene. two bed files uploaded to ucsc genome browser correspond to class  <dig>  and class  <dig>  segments of zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  the segments in each of class  <dig> and class  <dig> overlap annotated exons  of lrba . b an intronic region more conserved than exons. the annotated exon  of dachc  coincides with the segment in class  <dig>  the  <dig> nt long segment at the right end belongs to class  <dig>  hence is more conserved than the marked exon




conserved intronic elements are widespread in the human, mouse, and zebrafish genomes
some of the intronic conservation blocks identified were very short, or their assignment to the highly conserved class had a low probability. therefore, we filtered the results for intronic segments of at least 100 nt in length, such that each position in the region had ≥ <dig>  probability of belonging to the highly conserved class/classes of each gene in question. regions that passed this filtering were referred to as putative functional elements .

we identified  <dig> pfes distributed among  <dig> zebrafish genes with a median length of 168 nt and with 33% of the pfes longer than 200 nt . where the zebrafish genome contained multiple homologues for the human gene we frequently observed the conservation of the pfe in multiple zebrafish genes with  <dig> pfes located in zebrafish paralogues corresponding to  <dig> pfes in human. all other pfes were in one-to-one correspondence between zebrafish and human. pfes were found throughout the genome , but were not evenly distributed, with  <dig> genes containing 5– <dig> pfes,  <dig> genes containing  <dig> or more, and  <dig> pfes identified in foxp <dig>  alone.fig.  <dig> number of intronic pfes identified in each zebrafish chromosome.  <dig> intronic pfes were identified in  <dig> zebrafish chromosomes in total. the highest number of pfes  was detected in zebrafish chromosome  <dig>   <dig> pfes were identified in foxp <dig>  in chromosome  <dig> and this is the highest number of pfes found in a single gene followed by  <dig> pfes in npas <dig> 




identified elements correspond to novel, predicted, and known functional sequences
to determine if pfes represent functional elements, and to compare our results to those incorporating secondary structure, we compared pfes with regions identified by evofold, rnaz, dnase i footprinting, and to entries in the functional rna database. of the  <dig> pfes,  <dig>  were also identified by other methods . note that all of these methods except dnase i footprinting are suggestive of function at the rna level. in contrast dnase i footprinting suggests the presence of regulatory element binding sites. if we exclude dnase i footprinting,  <dig>  intronic pfes have existing annotations suggestive of rna-level function. evofold shared the greatest overlap with changept,  <dig> pfes  overlapping with evofold predictions, including  <dig> pfes containing multiple evofold predictions. only  <dig> pfes  were identified by the other predictive tool examined, rnaz .fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of genome-wide intronic pfes supported by other methods. 94% of the pfes found in the genome-wide analysis overlapped with the functional elements  identified in  <dig> other databases, evofold, frnadb, rnaz and dnase i footprints. most of the pfes overlapped with entries in evofold and there were  <dig> matches with experimentally identified ncrna transcripts in frnadb




comparison to experimental data for dnasei footprints suggested  <dig> pfes  were in protein binding regions. comparing with frnadb,  <dig> pfes matched with experimentally identified ncrna transcripts in the database . of these,  <dig> mapped to ncrnas identified in an analysis of the mouse transcriptome  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> pfes were contained in human ncrna transcripts  <cit> . except for one of the human ncrna transcripts , all other transcripts were substantially longer than the pfes they matched. this suggests that regions identified as pfes represent functional domains within longer rna transcripts.

as an added check to determine if pfes correspond to ncrnas, we compared the locations of pfes with long non-coding rnas  identified in zebrafish . there were  <dig> pfes overlapping with known lncrnas . of  <dig> pfes,  <dig> were not identified by the other methods used for comparisons, and thus can be classified as new predictions.

characterizing genes containing pfes
transcription factors are known to be enriched in intronic ncrnas  <cit> . to find if transcription factors were overrepresented in the  <dig> pfe containing genes we compared the proportion in these genes to that in the genome wide alignments. results indicated that  <dig> % of genes with pfes  are transcription factors and  <dig> %  are transcription co-factors  compared to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  respectively in the genome wide alignment. therefore pfes are highly enriched in transcription factors .

as an additional analysis, we examined the distribution of gene ontology  terms  in the  <dig> genes with pfes. go terms associated with transcription factors  were significantly overrepresented in genes containing pfes .

identification of intergenic pfes
in the genome-wide analysis we also identified  <dig> intergenic regions that satisfy the pfe selection criteria. of these,  <dig> intergenic pfes  were found to overlap with regions identified by other methods . this includes  <dig> intergenic pfes that were in ncrna transcripts according to frnadb entries and  <dig> intergenic pfes that overlapped with intergenic lncrnas identified in pauli et al.  <dig>  there were  <dig> highly conserved intergenic regions only identified by program changept.

examination of non-coding sequences in a specific pathway
the second part of our study was a pathway-focussed analysis allowing optimisation of the sequence alignment for each gene, and the potential to identify common elements within a pathway. pathway-focussed analysis was performed on  <dig> genes encoding transcription factors known to play important roles in myogenesis, and  <dig> genes encoding muscle proteins. for each gene, human-referenced 3-way alignments were generated independently using lagan alignment tool  <cit> .

identification of putative functional elements 
to search for the most conserved elements in each gene we applied changept to the 3-way alignments corresponding to each of the  <dig> genes. the profiles were visualised in context using wig files uploaded to the ucsc genome browser. fig.  <dig> demonstrates the effectiveness with which the distinct boundaries of functional elements can be identified. class  <dig> is the most conserved class, and sharp changes  in the wig profile for class  <dig> coincide closely with the annotated positions of exons. intronic regions, not previously reported as functional, are confidently predicted as belonging to the same conservation class that includes all the other exons. these regions were considered for pfe analysis using the same criteria used in the genome-wide analysis .fig.  <dig> wig profile of the eya <dig>  the top three profiles show, for each sequence position in the human eya <dig> dna sequence , the probability that any base at that position belongs to class  <dig> , class  <dig> , class  <dig>  respectively. at any position, the sum of the three profiles is  <dig>  the two rows below the class  <dig> profile display the exons  and the introns  of eya <dig> recorded in the ucsc and refseq collections respectively. exon boundaries are indicated with red vertical lines. class  <dig> corresponds mainly to the mapped exons of eya <dig>  and covers regions of high conservation between human, mouse and zebrafish




we identified  <dig> pfes in total, all in introns of  <dig> of the transcription factors with the majority distributed among eya <dig>  pax3a and pax <dig> . in contrast, no pfes were identified in the other muscle genes examined. of the  <dig> pfes, only  <dig>  were identified in our genome-wide analysis suggesting the optimised alignments had a significant impact on the ability to detect pfes. the median length of pfes was 222 nt  with 15/ <dig> longer than 200 nt, suggesting the length of the elements detected may also be affected by the alignments.

comparing pfes with other supporting evidence
we analysed the pathway-focussed pfes using the same methods used in the genome-wide analysis . an example wig profile of a 169 nt long pfe identified in the 3-way alignment of eya <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  three possible translation phases  indicate a lack of open reading frame within the region. the overlap of the pfe with a sequence protected in dna footprinting assays indicates protein binding in this region. furthermore, the pfe is also predicted by evofold.fig.  <dig> wig profile of eya <dig> pfe  <dig>  this pfe is located within intron  <dig> of human eya <dig> . the third bar from the top contains single letter amino acid codes corresponding to the actual protein translation phase. at the bottom, the light grey bar indicates a dnase-seq peak track and the green bar shows that there is an evofold prediction within the pfe which also suggest that this region is functional




the venn diagram in fig.  <dig> depicts the number of pfes supported by other evidence and summarised in table  <dig> . of  <dig> pfes,  <dig> were also identified by other methods.  if dnase i footprinting is not considered.) out of those  <dig>  the majority of pfes were identified by either evofold  or dnase i footprint regions . three pfes overlapped with multiple evofold regions . in all cases where pfes overlap with evofold regions, the pfes are longer; this suggests that our analysis has identified extended functional regions.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of pathway-focussed pfes supported by other methods. 88% of the pfes found in the pathway-focussed analysis overlapped with the functional elements  identified in  <dig> other databases, evofold, frnadb, rnaz and dnase i footprints. most of the pfes overlapped with entries in either evofold or dnase i footprints and there were  <dig> matches with experimentally identified ncrna transcripts in frnadb

three pfes matched with two experimentally identified ncrna transcripts in mouse . both transcripts that mapped to the corresponding region in the mouse genome were substantially longer than the pfes that they matched. this is consistent with our earlier observation that regions identified as pfes in the genome-wide analysis, where they overlap with known ncrnas, are typically shorter than those ncrnas, and thus may represent functional domains within longer rna transcripts. the remaining  <dig> pfes  were not identified by any of the  <dig> other methods used.table  <dig> pathway-focussed results: pfes matching with experimentally identified ncrnas in frnadb

one of the reasons for performing a pathway-focussed analysis was to investigate whether genes in the same pathway contain pfes with matching sequences. however, we did not find any such matches amongst the  <dig> pfes identified in our pathway-focussed analysis.

comparing pfes with cnss
another recent list of conserved non-coding sequences  was published by babarinde and saitou  <cit> . this list is based on a comparison of mammals using blastn. of the  <dig> intronic pfes identified by our criteria, only  <dig> overlap with these cnss. however, of the  <dig> intergenic pfes we identified,  <dig> overlapped with cnss.

intronic pfe sequences are expressed in the zebrafish
to investigate whether the intronic pfes identified are transcribed, rt-pcr analysis was performed using rna extracted from  <dig> hours post-fertilisation  zebrafish embryos . reverse transcription was carried out with a polydt primer to restrict amplification to mature, polyadenylated, mrna and exclude pre-mrna. 96%  of the pfes showed a positive pcr result indicating transcription of the pfe region . the positive control in each case confirmed that the gene of interest, from which the intronic pfe is derived, is also expressed at 24hpf. intronic regions within the gene of interest that were not identified as pfes were used as controls. the expected result was that there would be no pcr product as is seen for eya <dig> and eya <dig>  contrary to expectations, six of the other intronic regions showed a positive pcr result indicating that these intronic regions are also being transcribed. this supports the suggestion that pfes may be regions within larger transcripts.fig.  <dig> rt-pcr of intronic putative functional elements  showing their presence or absence in  <dig> hpf zebrafish cdna pools. each gene has between  <dig> and  <dig> pfes. exon lane contains an exonic region, spanning an intron, of the gene of interest. intron lane represents a randomly selected intronic region that was not identified as a pfe. primers were designed to amplify products with sizes ranging 57- <dig> bp. the ladder bands shown are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp. the gels with the two bands of the ladder showing are the  <dig> and  <dig> bp bands. the panel insert is a cdna control. β-actin  and rna  lanes demonstrate there is no genomic contamination. no template lane rules out contamination of other pcr reagents




given the detection of intronic transcripts for  <dig> out of  <dig> of the pfe containing genes we wanted to determine if intronic transcripts were found more frequently in pfe containing genes. we examined the expression of  <dig> additional muscle genes via rt-pcr . fifteen of the  <dig> genes were expressed at the stage examined and for only one of these, wnt7aa, was expression of an intronic sequence detectable.fig.  <dig> rt-pcr of muscle expressed genes not containing pfes. exonic sequence amplification is evident for  <dig> of the genes but only  <dig>  has amplification of an intronic sequence. primers were designed to amplify products with sizes ranging 100- <dig> bp. lane  <dig> for each gel contains a  <dig> bp ladder. the negative lanes are no template controls to rule out genomic dna contamination




discussion
one clue to the possible functions of pfes is their prevalence in the introns of transcription factors. this was strikingly demonstrated by the pathway-focussed analysis: all pfes were found in introns of transcription factors, and none in other muscle proteins. genome-wide,  <dig> % of the genes containing pfes are transcription factors . pfes are found in genes that are not transcription factors, but given that the defining criteria for pfes are based only on conservation level and length, a mixture of functional types is expected.

pfes found in the introns of transcription factors could contribute to regulatory interactions in various ways, including: containing binding sites for other transcription factors, containing auto-regulatory binding sites, folding into ncrnas that interact or form complexes with the host gene, or folding into ncrnas that interact or form complexes with other genes in a manner that coordinates their expression levels and activity with that of the containing gene.

our rt-pcr results showed that pfes from the introns of muscle-related genes are expressed and suggest that they may play a functional role at the rna level. the identification of the expression of non-pfe sequences also suggests the pfes are elements within larger intronic transcripts rather than defining the boundary of an intronic ncrna element. this is supported by the  <dig> pfes that matched experimentally verified ncrnas in human and mouse: all but one of these were from ncrnas substantially longer than the pfe.

one surprising finding is that only  <dig> of the  <dig> pfes identified in the pathway-focussed analysis were found in the genome-wide analysis. we attribute this to the superior quality of the alignments used in the pathway-focussed analysis, due not only to the use of lagan, but also to manual interventions to improve alignment quality. this suggests that the genome-wide analysis may be finding only a fraction of the intronic elements conserved between human and zebrafish, and that improving the quality of genome wide alignments would greatly enhance available methods to detect functional non-coding sequences.

to determine if pfes correspond to ncrnas or other regulatory sequences, we compared them to other bioinformatics resources . the majority  of our pfes identified in the genome-wide study contain evofold predicted regions. evofold has identified  <dig> intronic regions longer than 100 nt in the human genome with the potential to form rna structures. however a large number of these regions were absent from the alignment we used. this could be due in part to using different alignments with different assemblies and even different species. our analysis was performed using a more recent alignment including the human  <dig> assembly, whereas evofold findings are based on an earlier 8-way alignment including the human  <dig> assembly. the alignments contain only  <dig> species in common: human, mouse, zebrafish and fugu. on the other hand, we failed to detect  <dig> evofold predictions that were present in our alignment. this could be due to:  failing to satisfy the pfe gap criteria ; or  the segments may not be as highly conserved as exons.

this situation was reversed in the pathway-focussed analysis, where we identified  <dig> pfes and evofold only found  <dig> regions ≥ 100 nt in the same human genes. this could be attributed to the success of our bayesian method applied to an improved alignment used in the pathway-focussed analysis.

ninety-seven  of the pfes identified in the genome-wide analysis do not contain evofold regions and are not within 30 nt of an evofold region. of these, 61%  overlap with either rnaz, dnase i footprints, or frnadb entries. moreover,  <dig> pfes identified in the pathway-focussed analysis do not contain evofold predictions but were all found to be expressed in our rt-pcr results. in addition to identifying putative ncrnas not identified by evofold, our method typically extends the length of the predicted functional regions, so much so that many of our pfes contain two or more evofold predictions. in particular, in the pathway-focussed results, pfes that contain an evofold prediction are substantially longer than that evofold prediction.

the intronic pfes we have identified differ substantially from the cnss of babarinde and saitou  <cit> , with approximately 70% of intronic pfes not overlapping cnss. in contrast, almost all of our intergenic pfes overlap with cnss. one reason for differences between pfes and cnss is that they are based on different species comparisons: human, mouse and zebrafish in the former case and human, mouse, dog, cattle and chicken in the latter. however, the novel intronic pfes we detected may be due at least in part to our bayesian change-point methodology, which uses information about sequence composition and mutation frequency in addition to conservation to identify segmental structure. another distinctive feature of our methodology is that the criteria for identifying pfes depends on the local characteristics of the sequence. in particular, we identify which segment classes contain the exons of the containing gene, and extract pfes from these classes and more highly conserved classes. this may explain why our method identified many novel pfes in introns, where the conservation level of the adjacent exons provides a benchmark for the local level of similarity of conserved sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a systematic process centred on a bayesian segmentation method to identify putative intronic functional elements in genomes that may contain ncrnas and other regulatory sequences. we carried out independent genome-wide and pathway-focussed analyses identifying conserved non-coding sequences that we termed putative functional elements  in human, mouse and zebrafish. comparison of pfes to other databases indicative of non-protein-coding function revealed further evidence of function for most of our pfes, with many of our pfes substantially increasing the sequence length of other predictions. pfes identified in our pathway-focussed analyses were shown to be expressed in 24hpf zebrafish embryos, with evidence that expressed elements are longer even than our pfes, suggesting that computational methods of detecting functional elements, including our own, are finding conserved domains within longer elements of currently unknown extent. pfes are significantly enriched in the introns of transcription factors, suggesting many of them play roles in the regulatory networks of the containing tf.
