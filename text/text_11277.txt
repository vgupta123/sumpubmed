BACKGROUND
glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible bilateral blindness worldwide. optineurin or the “optic neuropathy inducing” gene was discovered in  <dig>  <cit>  to be a candidate gene of primary open-angle glaucoma , the most common form of glaucoma. poag, characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells  and progressive axonal and visual field loss, is age-related and frequently associated with increased intraocular pressure   <cit> . it is genetically heterogeneous, caused by several susceptibility genes  <cit>  as well as environmental factors  <cit> . optineurin was found to be linked in particular to normal tension glaucoma   <cit> , a subtype of poag. optineurin mutations were noted to vary with ethnic background  <cit> . the glu50lys  mutation, found in caucasian and hispanic populations, seems to be associated with a more progressive and severe disease in ntg patients  <cit> .

more recently, mutations in optineurin have also been reported to associate with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   <cit> . in addition, optineurin was identified as one of the genetic risk factors for paget’s disease of bone  <cit> .

the human optineurin gene codes for a 577-amino acid protein  <cit> . the optineurin protein consists of a nf-κb essential molecule -like domain, leucine zipper motif, multiple coiled-coil motifs, an ubiquitin binding domain, a microtubule associated protein  <dig> light chain  <dig> -interacting motif, and a carboxyl -terminal zinc finger  <cit> . optineurin is a cytosolic protein that is not secreted  <cit> . it is expressed in many non-ocular tissues such as the brain and the heart as well as in ocular tissues including the retina and the trabecular meshwork  <cit> .

optineurin has been shown to be a negative regulator of the nf-κb pathway  <cit> , an autophagy receptor  <cit> , as well as a player in antiviral immune response  <cit>  and mitotic progression  <cit> . this protein is moreover demonstrated to interact and form complexes with proteins including rab <dig>  huntingtin, myosin vi, and transferrin receptor, and such interactions may be the basis why optineurin is also involved in regulation of protein trafficking  <cit> .

it has been previously reported that in cultured rgc <dig> cells, optineurin is ubiquitinated and the turnover of endogenous optineurin involves mainly the ubiquitin proteasome pathway  in normal homeostatic situation  <cit> . when optineurin is upregulated or mutated, the level of proteasome β <dig> subunit , an indicator of proteasome activity  <cit> , is reduced, signifying a compromised upp function  <cit> . the level of the lipidated form of lc <dig>  lc3-ii, is elevated, indicating that autophagosome formation/autophagy is increased  <cit> . additionally, the level of p <dig>  a maker for autophagy substrate degradation  <cit> , was concurrently found declined in e50k optineurin-transfected rgc <dig> cells , suggesting an activation of both autophagy and autophagic flux.

to validate the in vitro results and substantiate their relevance, especially in light of the recent finding that the originally thought rat retinal ganglion rgc <dig> cell line is in fact 661 w  <cit> , a mouse sv-40 t antigen transformed photoreceptor cell line, the present in vivo investigation was undertaken. adeno-associated type  <dig> viral  vectors for green fluorescence protein , gfp-tagged wild-type and e50k optineurin were intravitreally injected into rats for expression in rgcs. the purpose was to determine whether impairment of upp and/or induction of autophagy would take place in vivo as in vitro. additionally, the study examined whether the accumulated mutant optineurin could be efficiently cleared by rescuing strategies such as the use of autophagic enhancer rapamycin.

RESULTS
normal iop in raav transduced eyes
to introduce gene expression in the rgc layer in the retina, aav2-gfp-, aav2-optineurin -gfp-, and aav2-e50k-gfp-vectors were injected intravitreally into the left eyes of brown norway rats. the iop was monitored at day  <dig> , and weeks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-injection using rebound tonometer tonolab in awake rats. no significant changes were observed in any of the injected eyes compared with pbs-injected or non-injected controls . the iop during the course of experiments was in general 11–14 mmhg in all of the rat eyes as expected.figure  <dig> iop readings and retinal ganglion cell counts in aav <dig> viral vector injected rat eyes. a. iop measurements. one eye of the rats was intravitreally injected with one of the aav <dig> viral vectors , and the contralateral eye was either non-injected  or injected with pbs  as negative controls. the iop was measured before injection , or  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 weeks post-injection. results are presented as mean ± sem . no iop difference was seen between aav <dig> injection and control groups. b-d. retinal whole mounts. rat eyes were injected intravitreally with one of the aav <dig> viral vectors . five weeks post-injection, the retinal whole mounts were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. efficient transduction in cells in the retinal ganglion layer was observed. the gfp expression was robust with clearly visible retinal ganglion axons. insets show other areas at a higher magnification. scale bars, 20 μm. e. bar graphs depict total retinal ganglion cell counts per retina. results are presented as mean ± sem . *, p <  <dig>  compared with gfp controls.



transgene expression
the efficiency of transgene expression was assessed in retinal whole mounts. after enucleation of the globe, the anterior segment was removed and the posterior segment was fixed briefly. the retina was then isolated, divided into quadrants and flat mounted onto a microscopic slide with the rgc side up. the gfp-positive cells were visualized and the number of gfp positive cells in digital images of  <dig> randomly sampled 20x whole mount fields was determined. transduction of aav2-gfp , aav2-optn-gfp  and aav2-e50k-gfp  was found highly and equally efficient in cells of the rgc layer. the total number of gfp-positive cells was 105718 ±  <dig> per retina in the aav2-gfp treated control eyes. the cell count was significantly  reduced to 79838 ±  <dig> and 71874 ± 9865/retina respectively in aav2-optn-gfp- and aav2-e50k-gfp-injected eyes .

degeneration of optic nerve axons in optineurin transduced eyes
to examine the optic nerve axons, optic nerves in the enucleated eyes were fixed and processed. semi-thin sections prepared were stained with toluidine blue. subsequent analysis of the optic nerve axons using high-power light microscopy demonstrated normal axonal features in aav2-gfp-treated and pbs-injected control eyes. by contrast, densely stained degenerating axons as well as axonal swellings were observed, interspersed with normal axons, in eyes administered with optineurin and e50k viral constructs . quantification of axonal counts indicated a significantly  decreased axon count in aav2-optn-gfp-injected  eyes compared to pbs  and gfp  controls. a greater degree of axon decrease was seen in e50k-expressing  specimens .figure  <dig> optic nerve axons in aav <dig> viral vector injected rat eyes. a. high-power view of representative optic nerve axon cross sections of rats 5 weeks following injection of pbs, or one of the viral vectors . pbs injection was used as negative control. magnification, x <dig>  scale bar, 20 μm. the axons in pbs- and gfp vector-injected eyes showed normal morphology while densely stained degenerating axons as well as axonal swellings were seen in wild-type optn- and e50k-gfp-vector injected eyes. b. total axon counts. the value  in wild-type optn-gfp injected eyes was significantly  lower than that in pbs and gfp injected control eyes. a greater decrease of total axon count was found in e50k-gfp injected eyes.



proteasomal compromise and autophagy induction in optineurin transduced eyes
retinal cross sections were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin  staining to assess retinal changes in optineurin transduced rat eyes. it was noted that 5 weeks following aav2-optn-gfp or aav2-e50k-gfp injection, the retina showed a reduced number of ganglion cells and thinning of the inner nuclear layer compared to pbs - or aav2-gfp - injected as well as non-injected  controls.figure  <dig> histology and levels of optineurin, p <dig>  psmb <dig> and lc <dig> in the retina of viral vector injected rat eyes. a. representative retinal sections collected following injection of pbs, and gfp-, wild-type optn - and e50k-optn -gfp vectors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . gcl, ganglion cell layer; ipl, inner plexiform layer; inl, inner nuclear layer; opl, outer plexiform layer; and onl, outer nuclear layer. the retinal ganglion cell number was decreased and the inl thickness was reduced in optn- and e50k-injected specimens compared to pbs and gfp controls. scale bar,  <dig> μm. b. retinal sections from rat eyes were stained in parallel with polyclonal anti-optineurin, p <dig>  psmb <dig>  or lc <dig> . an enhanced optineurin  and lc <dig> staining, and a declined psmb <dig> and p <dig> staining were observed in the retinal ganglion layer of optn and e50k-injected eyes compared to controls. scale bar,  <dig> μm. c. western blotting for optineurin, psmb <dig>  lc <dig>  and gapdh in retinal extracts from gfp-, optn-gfp -, and e50k-optn-gfp -injected eyes. the lc3-i bands were very faint and only those of lc3-ii were shown. the level of optineurin overexpression was estimated by comparing the intensities of both  bands from optineurin treatment groups to those of the endogenous optineurin band from gfp groups . the optineurin/gapdh ratios  for the gfp, optn, and e50k groups were, respectively,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . for psmb5/gapdh, the corresponding values  were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; and for lc3/gapdh, they were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . all optn and e50k results were significantly  different from those of gfp controls.



the expression level of optineurin, p <dig>  psmb <dig>  and lc <dig> in the rgc layer was investigated in retinal cross sections by immunostaining. as anticipated, retinal sections from wild-type and e50k optineurin transduced eyes yielded a stronger optineurin staining than the controls . they in addition displayed a fainter staining of p <dig>  and psmb <dig> , and a stronger staining of lc <dig>  in rgcs. western blot analyses further revealed that the psmb <dig> protein level was decreased by approximately 50% while the optineurin level  was increased by 8– <dig> fold upon transduction of wild-type and e50k optineurin in rat eyes .

lc <dig> exists in two forms. lc3-i  is cytosolic and lc3-ii  is the lipidated form  that inserts into the membrane. the amount of lc3-ii is correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation and increasing levels of lc3-ii on immunoblots have been used to document induction of autophagy  <cit> . in rats, the level of lc3-ii protein in the retina was found increased by approximately  <dig> - <dig>  fold by western blotting in aav2-optineurin wild-type and e50k-treated eyes . p <dig>  an ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein  <cit> , is itself degraded by autophagy and serves as a maker for autophagy substrate degradation  <cit> . a decreased p <dig> level has been correlated with activation of autophagy and autophagic flux and an increased p <dig> level correlates with autophagic suppression  <cit> . the observed weaker p <dig> staining corroborated an induced autophagy and enhanced autophagic flux in wild-type and e50k optineurin transduced eyes.

apoptosis level was elevated in rgcs in optineurin transduced eyes
tdt-mediated dutp nick-end labeling  assay was carried out to assess apoptosis in the rgc layer. retinal tissue sections from rats 5 weeks following the aav2-optn-gfp or aav2-e50k-gfp injection were found to exhibit a much higher percentage  of apoptotic rgcs than aav2-gfp  and non-injected  controls .figure  <dig> apoptosis of cells in the retinal ganglion layer of rat eyes. a. apoptotic cells in the retinal ganglion layer in eyes non-injected , and those 5 weeks post-injected with gfp, optn-gfp , and e50k-gfp  viral vectors. a representative image from each group was shown. retinal sections were examined by an apoptag kit. images  were captured and cell counting was performed to determine the total number of retinal ganglion cells  and the number of apoptotic ones . scale bar, 25 μm. b. percentage of apoptotic rgcs was calculated. results are shown in mean ± sem . the values for normal control, and gfp, optn, and e50k groups were, respectively,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . *, p <  <dig>  compared with non-injected normal and gfp controls.



proteasomal compromise and autophagy induction in rat eyes with chronic hypertension
hypertonic saline was injected into episcleral veins of brown norway rat to obstruct the aqueous outflow to achieve chronic iop elevation  <cit> . the optic nerve damage in this rat model was graded from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . in one set of experiment, sections with optic nerve damage graded as  <dig>   <dig>  , and  <dig> were used. the sections were deparaffinized and stained in parallel for optineurin, psmb <dig>  and lc <dig>  analogous to wild-type and e50k optineurin transduced eyes, an enhanced optineurin, reduced psmb <dig> and increased lc <dig> staining was observed in the rgc layer of sections from injury grades  <dig>  and  <dig> compared to injury grade  <dig>   in the rat ocular hypertension model . quantification analyses confirmed that the optineurin and lc <dig> levels in the rgc layer were higher, and the psmb <dig> level was lower with advanced optic nerve injury. the alterations were more notable with increasing injury grades . in another set of experiment, sections with optic nerve damage graded as  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> , and  <dig> were stained. an increased optineurin and lc <dig> staining and a decreased psmb <dig> staining, were likewise discerned especially with grade  <dig> optic nerve damage . these results suggested that an inhibition of proteasomal activity and induction of autophagy might also occur in hypertensive eyes in the rat experimental model.figure  <dig> immunostaining of optineurin , psmb <dig>  and lc <dig> in the eyes of a rat chronic hypertension model. the optic nerve damage in the rats was graded from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a. retinal cross sections of grades  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> were immunostained. the grade  <dig>  and  <dig> slides showed stronger optn and lc <dig>  but weaker psmb <dig>  staining, compared with that of grading  <dig>  . higher magnification of staining was shown in insets. scale bars, 25 μm. images  were captured and the intensity of each staining in retinal ganglion cells was quantified. results  are presented in the bar graph at the right panel. the staining intensity  for optineurin was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, for grades  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  the corresponding relative intensity for psmb <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; and that for lc <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . b. bar graphs depict the staining intensity of optn, psmb <dig>  and lc <dig> in retinal ganglion cells in another set of experiments. the retinal cross sections of grades  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were used. the relative staining intensity  for optineurin was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, for grades  <dig>   <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig>  the corresponding intensity for psmb <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; and that for lc <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . **, p <  <dig> ; *, p <  <dig>  compared to grade  <dig> 



effects of rapamycin
rapamycin is an inhibitor of the ser/thr protein kinase named “mammalian target of rapamycin”   <cit> . inhibition of mtor mimics cellular starvation that induces autophagy by blocking signals required for cell growth and proliferation. rapamycin is thus also recognized as an autophagic inducer. rats injected with aav2-gfp- and aav2-e50k-gfp-vectors were treated with rapamycin to determine whether this treatment can reduce or rescue optineurin-mediated phenotypes in rats. right after intravitreal injection of viral vectors, the treatment began by intraperitoneal injection of 1% v/w solution of rapamycin, 20 mg/kg body weight, as was successfully done previously in mouse studies  <cit> . the iop, monitored at day  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 weeks after viral injection, was not affected by rapamycin injections . results also indicated that following rapamycin treatments, the rgc  and axonal  counts in e50k-gfp-expressing eyes were increased, closer to the control level, compared to the e50k-without rapamycin treatment group. the rgc counts were 105105 ±  <dig>  104323 ±  <dig>  70633 ±  <dig>  and 82596 ±  <dig>  and the total axon counts were 739059 ±  <dig>  80642 ±  <dig>  540323 ±  <dig>  and 732678 ±  <dig>  respectively, for gfp, gfp + rapamycin, e50k, and e50k + rapamycin groups. the optic nerve axons of gfp control without and with rapamycin treatment groups displayed normal morphology. e50k-gfp-injected eyes showed a reasonably normal-appearing optic nerve cross section with rapamycin treatment, compared with the extensive degeneration without the treatment . the extent of apoptosis  was significantly  decreased. the apoptotic percentage was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively for gfp, gfp + rapamycin, e50k, and e50k + rapamycin groups.figure  <dig> effects of rapamycin. a. iop values in rat eyes treated or untreated with rapamycin. two sets of rats were injected with gfp  or e50k-gfp  viral vector. one set  received intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin. the other set did not receive rapamycin treatment as controls. no change in iop was observed without or with rapamycin treatment. b. bar graphs depict total retinal ganglion cell counts per retina in retinal whole mounts from gfp or e50k-gfp viral vector injected eyes. one set of the animals received rapamycin treatment. results are presented as mean ± sem . c. representative high-power view  of optic nerve axon cross sections from eyes collected  <dig> weeks following intravitreal injection of gfp or e50k-gfp viral vector without or with treatment of rapamycin . scale bar,  <dig> μm. total axon counts in different groups are shown in the bar graph . d. percentage of apoptotic cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer  in sections from gfp or e50k-gfp viral vector injected eyes without or with rapamycin  treatment. e. immunostaining of optineurin , p <dig>  psmb <dig>  and lc <dig>  in gfp and e50k-gfp injected eyes without or with rapamycin treatment. scale bar,  <dig> μm. f. bar graph depicts the staining intensity  of optn, p <dig>  psmb <dig>  and lc <dig> in retinal ganglion cell layer in each treatment group relative to that of the gfp control group. *, p <  <dig> ; #, p <  <dig>  compared to gfp no treatment controls.



compared to gfp controls, the staining levels of optineurin and lc <dig> were significantly  higher, and those of psmb <dig> and p <dig> were lower, confirming that the proteasome function was compromised and autophagic process was activated in e50k transduced rat eyes. rapamycin treatment in those rats caused a substantial reduction in the optineurin level  while the lc <dig> level was further elevated . in gfp viral vector injected specimens, the level of optineurin was similar with or without rapamycin administration . consistent with the rapamycin autophagy-inducing action, the lc <dig> staining was enhanced and the p <dig> staining was decreased in the gfp + rapamycin group . the level of psmb <dig> was also diminished by rapamycin , which has been reported previously to inhibit proteasome activity in rapamycin-fed mice  <cit> .

discussion
optineurin is a gene linked to ntg and als. it has previously been shown in cultured rgc <dig> cells that optineurin is ubiquitinated  <cit> . in normal homeostatic situation, the endogenous optineurin is processed mainly through the upp pathway. upon overexpression and/or mutation, the upp function is inhibited and autophagy is induced for clearance of the protein  <cit> .

the present study used aav infection to extend the in vitro findings to in vivo adult rats. to date aav has been the method of choice for gene delivery to rgcs  <cit> . little or no signs of inflammation, cytotoxicity, abnormal growth, or immune reaction have been detected in the eyes following administration of aavs  <cit> . there are many different serotypes of aav, but aav <dig> displays excellent tropism for rgcs, especially when injected into the vitreous  <cit> . strong, constitutive promoters such as cmv and/or β-actin are commonly used to drive transgene expression  <cit> .

we used ptr-sb-smcba-v <dig> vector to construct aav2-optn-gfp vectors. the advantage of using this plasmid is that the size of the smcba promoter is smaller  compared to the full-length cba , while it still exhibits an expression pattern similar to that of the full-length cba in the retina  <cit> . because of the smaller size, wild-type or e50k mutant optn-gfp fusion gene  can be successfully packaged into viral particles.

in pilot experiments, moderate to strong gfp expression in rgcs was observed in rat eyes 5 weeks after a single intravitreal injection of aav2-gfp containing a total of 5 ×  <dig> vp while little inflammation, cytotoxicity, or abnormal growth was noted. these parameters were thus selected for the study. the number of gfp-expressing green cells/field, the average intensity/cell, the total number of rgcs, and the integrity of optic nerve axons were compared between the aav2-gfp injected eyes and non-injected or pbs-injected controls. as anticipated from reported observations  <cit> , no significant difference was detected. by contrast, in wild-type and e50k optineurin-injected eyes, the retina was thinner, the rgc density was lower, the apoptosis level was higher, the axons were degenerated, and the axon counts were much reduced. these findings were consistent with the previous in vitro data, which showed that upregulated and mutated optineurin induced toxic effects such as apoptosis  <cit> . also as in vitro  <cit> , the deleterious optineurin phenotypes were more dramatically seen in vivo with the e50k mutation than the wild-type , suggesting that the observed consequences were, at least in part, related to the mutant, not merely a reflection of the overexpressed protein level. of note in addition is that during the course of the experiment, the iop in rats after viral delivery of the optineurin gene to rgcs, as expected from the clinical perspective, was not increased.

the previous in vitro findings were established using mostly rgc <dig> cells, an immortalized rat rgc cell line created originally by transforming postnatal day  <dig> rat retinal cells with e1a adenovirus  <cit> . these cells, while having been used extensively in the field, are now shown to be a different retinal cell type, namely, mouse sv-40 t antigen transformed photoreceptor 661 w cells  <cit> . it is thus imperative to validate the results in in vivo animal models. we herein demonstrated that in rat eyes, viral expression of wild-type and e50k optineurin in rgc layer did result in a declined psmb <dig>  an increased lc <dig>  as well as a reduced p <dig> levels in the rgc layer, confirming that an impaired upp function and induced autophagic process previously documented in rgc <dig> cultures  also occurred in vivo.

interestingly, in a chronic ocular hypertension rat model  <cit> , a downregulation of the proteasomal activity in the rgc layer was also observed by psmb <dig> immunostaining in eyes with optic nerve injuries . in this rat model, optineurin was in addition found increased and autophagy was activated in advanced injury . optineurin expression has been shown to be upregulated with sustained pressure elevation in human perfusion organ cultures  <cit> . autophagy has also been demonstrated to be activated in rgcs in other models after optic nerve transection and ischemia and with acute or chronic iop elevation in rats  <cit> .

autophagy has emerged as a key process with implications in disease conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. it is a major degradation pathway for aggregate-prone, intracytosolic proteins causing neurodegenerative disorders such as huntington’s disease  <cit> . upregulating autophagy has been shown to be a promising therapeutic intervention for clearing these disease-causing proteins  <cit> . rapamycin, a compound already approved by the u.s. food and drug administration  <cit> , and its analogs have been used previously to reduce huntingtin levels and attenuate the mutant huntingtin toxicity in cell, fly and mouse models of disease  <cit> . while rapamycin may also affect pathways other than autophagy  <cit> , its protective effect was attributed, at least partially, to enhanced clearance of the mutant protein via autophagy. rapamycin, lithium, and trehalose have also been shown to increase clearance of autophagy substrates α-synuclein and mutant huntingtin  <cit> . we applied a similar strategy and found that rapamycin was effective to reduce the overexpressed e50k optineurin, avert the optineurin phenotype, and increase cell survival in our in vivo rat model. currently, investigators are actively searching for small and safe molecules to enhance autophagy  <cit> . reduction of the optineurin level and rescue of rgcs from cell death by various approaches in vivo, if successful, will certainly have high translational impact.

CONCLUSIONS
optineurin is a gene linked to ntg and als. it has been shown previously in cultured rgc <dig> cells that optineurin is ubiquitinated. in normal homeostatic situation, the endogenous optineurin is processed mainly through the upp pathway. upon overexpression and/or mutation, the upp function is compromised and autophagy is induced for clearance of the protein. we herein demonstrated that in rat eyes, viral expression of wild-type and e50k optineurin in rgc layer also resulted in an impaired upp function and an induced autophagic process. the level of psmb <dig> and p <dig> was declined and lc <dig> was elevated in vivo, confirming the previous rgc <dig> in vitro results. apoptosis was in addition observed. furthermore, rapamycin was found effective in reducing the overexpressed e50k optineurin, averting the optineurin phenotype, and increasing cell survival in the in vivo rat model. reduction of the optineurin level and rescue of rgcs from cell death by rapamycin and other analogs may have high translational impact.
