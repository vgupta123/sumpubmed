BACKGROUND
antibiotic-associated diarrhea  and clostridium difficile infection  are frequent complications of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. in a large prospective multicenter study, aad was observed in  <dig> % of the patients  receiving long-term antibiotic treatment with > 50% of patients showing positive testing for c. difficile toxin b  <cit> . the incidence of cdi is still increasing  <cit>  and the disease is complicated by the occurrence of virulent and pathogenic c. difficile ribotypes associated with higher morbidity and mortality, which are responsible for cdi outbreaks worldwide  <cit> . the increasing incidence and mortality associated with the cdi and the significant rate of treatment failures and recurrences with current antibiotics emphasize the role of preventative strategies.

probiotics are promising agents in the prevention of aad and cdi. originally they were used in the therapy of aad and cdi and for regeneration of intestinal microbiota after antibiotic treatment. a significant reduction of aad and cdi could be observed in randomized clinical trials when administered simultaneously with the antibiotic substances  <cit> . probiotic microbes have positive impact on microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, and could also limit pathogen by modulating gut microbiome competitive interactions and/or by producing antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . reports state positive effect of probiotics on beneficial short chain fatty acid production and negative on harmful net ammonia production  <cit> .

however, the heterogeneity of probiotic formulations and the vague definition of probiotics as otherwise not classified microorganisms that improve health of the host impede the assessment of clinical trials. several effects have been attributed to probiotics, among them direct influences on the composition of intestinal microbiota, the intestinal metabolism and the immune response  <cit> , but the exact mode of action is poorly understood. previously, we have developed a validated, dynamic in vitro model of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> , which allows for mode of action studies to be performed.

mechanistic studies are difficult to perform in vivo due to difficulties in sampling and ethical considerations. the in vitro gastrointestinal model of the colon simulates to a high degree the successive dynamic processes in the large intestine  <cit> . the model is a unique tool to study the stability, release, dissolution, absorption and bioconversion of nutrients, chemicals, bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals in the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . besides the average physiological conditions and the biological variation, also abnormal or specific conditions can be simulated in a reproducible way. the following standardized conditions are simulated: body temperature; ph in the lumen; delivery of a pre-digested substrate from the 'ileum'; mixing and transport of the intestinal contents; presence of a complex, high density, metabolically active, anaerobic microbiota of human origin; and absorption of water and metabolic products via a semipermeable membrane inside the colon model  <cit> . this model has been validated successfully with regards to the number and ratio of the various micro-organisms which are similar in composition and metabolic activity with that of the human colon. furthermore, it has been validated for the production of metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids , branched-chain fatty acids , gases, ammonia, and phenolic compounds and used for studies on bioconversion of flavonoids  <cit>  or glucosinolates by the human colon microbiota  <cit> .

the in vitro system can support scientific research, e.g. studying the role of specific micro-organisms in the fermentation of dietary fibers, the fate and function of probiotics and other foods or drugs, and the development of novel products in a shorter time.

in this study different therapeutic regimens  were investigated in the in vitro model using a standardized intestinal human microbiota originating from healthy adult volunteers. we monitored beneficial  and putrefactive/toxic  metabolites. the intestinal microbiota composition was also analyzed under the different conditions.

methods
test products
the two test products were clindamycin and vsl # <dig>  clindamycin  is a broad-spectrum lincosamide antibiotic usually used to treat anaerobic infections. it is effective against most gram-positive cocci and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria and comparable with macrolide antibiotics. vsl# <dig>  is a multi-species probiotic and contains the following  <dig> species: streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.

ethical approval
a general ethical committee vote for the collection of stool samples of healthy volunteers had been obtained from the local ethical board of the medical faculty of the christian-albrechts-university  in kiel. all volunteers have given informed consent.

test system: tno large-intestinal model 

the study was performed in the tno dynamic system of the large intestine  as schematically represented in figure  <dig> and as described in detail by venema et al.  <cit>  and minekus et al.  <cit> .

microbiota
the study was performed in tim- <dig> with an active microbiota originating from ten healthy adults. inclusion and exclusion criteria were: age between  <dig> and  <dig> years, no chronic or active disease, no medication , no pregnancy, and no stay at hospital within the last  <dig> months. the mean age was  <dig>  years, the gender ratio m:f was 5: <dig>  stool samples were collected and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196°c. the material was shipped on dry ice to tno. in order to increase the reproducibility of the inoculation a standardized microbiota was prepared from these stools according to venema et al.  <cit> .

micro-ecological studies
after inoculation of the system with the microbiota the experiments started with a  <dig> hour stabilization period in which the microbiota could adapt to the system. thereafter the test period started. in the control unit the standard ileal efflux meal  was fed to the system. siem was given at a rate of  <dig> ml/day. its composition is described in maathuis et al. . in brief, it contained the following components:  <dig>  g k2hpo <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g nacl,  <dig>  g feso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g cacl <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g cysteine.hcl,  <dig>  pectin,  <dig>  xylan,  <dig>  arabinogalactan,  <dig>  amylopectin,  <dig>  casein,  <dig>  starch,  <dig> tween  <dig>   <dig>  bactopeptone,  <dig>  bile, plus  <dig> ml of a vitamin mixture containing :  <dig> mg menadione,  <dig> mg d-biotin,  <dig>  mg vitamin b <dig>   <dig> mg pantothenate,  <dig> mg nicotinamide,  <dig> mg p-aminobenzoic acid and  <dig> mg thiamine. the ph was kept constant at  <dig> . the antibiotic was administered as a shot at the start of the experiment  and furthermore the antibiotic was administered with the siem  and it was added to the dialysate  in order to prevent dialysis of antibiotic out of the lumen. dialysis liquid contained :  <dig>  g k2hpo <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g nacl,  <dig>  g feso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g mgso <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g cacl <dig> h2o,  <dig>  g cysteine.hcl,  <dig>  bile, plus  <dig> ml of the vitamin mixture. the probiotic compound was administered at a dose of  <dig>  g per day containing at least  <dig> billion bacteria , and was administered as a single shot each  <dig> h after dissolving the powder is  <dig> ml dialysis liquid.

in the tim- <dig> experiments, the composition of the colon microbiota was followed in time after intake of the test compounds  during several days at a frequent intervals . the control experiment without any addition was performed as a single run, the variation with the first  <dig> days addition of antibioics and then  <dig> days probiotics was performed in triplicate, while the variation with the combined addition of probiotics + antibiotics was performed in duplicate. analysis of the composition of the microbiota indicated the bacterial genera which were selectively stimulated or suppressed by the test compounds. in addition, samples were analyzed for scfa, bcfa, lactate and ammonia. these values provided an indication of the balance between health-promoting and toxic products produced by the microbiota after addition of the different compounds i) separately and consecutively or ii) in combination. analysis of  these microbial metabolites provided information on the functionality of the changes that took place in the microbiota.

sampling
before, during  and at the end of the fermentation experiments, samples were taken from the lumen of the model and from the dialysis liquid for analysis on metabolites. each day  <dig> ml was taken out of the system to simulate passage of stool. additional samples were taken from the lumen of the colon model for analyzing the composition of the microbiota using the i-chip platform . these samples were taken at day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig> 

short chain fatty acids  and branched chain fatty acids  analyses
the lumen and dialysis samples were analyzed gas-chromatographically on the concentrations of scfa and bcfa as follows: samples were centrifuged  and a mixture of formic acid , methanol and 2-ethyl butyric acid  was added to the clear supernatant. according to the method described by jouany  <cit>  as described in detail by van nuenen et al.  <cit> , a  <dig> -μl sample was injected on a gc-column  in a chrompack cp <dig> gas chromatograph using an automatic sampler .

lactate
for lactate analysis the samples were centrifuged as described above. in the clear supernatant both l- and d-lactate were determined enzymatically  by a cobas mira plus autoanalyzer , as described in detail by van nuenen et al.  <cit> . the analysis is based on the conversion of nad + into nadh.

ammonia
for the analysis for the protein-fermentative metabolite ammonia samples were centrifuged as described above and analyzed as described in detail by van nuenen et al.  <cit> . the analysis is based on the conversion of free ammonia with hypochlorite/phenol reagent into blue indophenol. in the clear supernatant indophenol was measured by measuring the absorbance at  <dig> nm with a cobas mira plus autoanalyzer.

i-chip platform
the 'intestinal chip'  has been developed as a faster alternative method to determine the composition of the microbiota. sequences of approximately  <dig> microorganisms have been placed on a dna micro-array as previously described  <cit> . dna was isolated from the luminal samples of the tim- <dig> experiments. subsequently the dna was labeled and hybridized to dna-arrays printed with the probes. after washing the arrays were scanned and analyzed. analysis of the composition of the microbiota  indicated the bacterial genera which are selectively stimulated or suppressed by the antibiotic and/or probiotic. changes in the composition of the microbiota in the experiments in which clindamycin was applied for seven days, or in which clindamycin plus probiotics were applied together for seven days, were compared with the changes in the control experiment in the same time period. changes in the composition of the microbiota after application of probiotics sequentially after the application of clindamycin were compared to the composition of the microbiota after the application of clindamycin for seven days.

sam analysis
the data obtained with the i-chip were analyzed with significance analysis of microarrays  for statistical relevance  <cit> .

RESULTS
in vivo, clindamycin shows good penetration into tissues and is often used to treat skin or soft tissue infections. pseudomembranous colitis  caused by overgrowth of clostridium difficile is a potentially life-threatening complication of antibiotic therapy. the probiotic product vsl# <dig> is a dietary supplement often used for treatment of various gastrointestinal complaints directly associated with microbial dysbiosis such as chronic constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, ulcerative colitis and pouchitis  <cit> .

the in vitro model used in this study provides standardized and reliable conditions to study the effects of pro- and antibiotics on the human intestinal microbiota  <cit>  and is has an advantage over living system in continuous sampling over a defined period of time. moreover, the system is hardly biased by environmental factors, e.g. temperature, humidity or oxygen, which can be controlled to a high extent.

the tim- <dig> experiments were performed using a standardized microbiota from healthy individuals. in the control unit the standard ileal efflux meal  was fed to the system. in one experiment the antibiotic was administered together with a probiotic mixture  and in the other experiment the probiotic was administered after the antibiotic treatment.

production of beneficial microbial metabolites
short chain fatty acids  and lactate are beneficial microbial metabolites. scfa and lactate acidify the intestinal lumen, causing growth arrest or even death of . in addition, the scfa are an energy source for the host: butyrate for colonic epithelial cells, acetate and propionate, in amongst others liver and muscle cells  <cit> . figure  <dig> presents cumulative total production of the short chain fatty acids, e.g acetate, propionate and n-butyrate during the different experiments in tim- <dig>  and represents metabolites present in lumen and dialysate. the amount of scfa present at the start of the experiment has been artificially set to zero so the graphs only reflect the production of metabolites after start of addition of the test products.

the total scfa production was not affected by the use of clindamycin or clindamycin plus probiotics. when probiotics were administered after the administration of clindamycin for one week, the scfa production increased since the slope of the total scfa production increased in the second week, compared with the first week of the experiment. the production of n-butyrate and propionate was increased when probiotics were added. the acetate concentration was unaffected by the addition of clindamycin or probiotics. when clindamycin and probiotics were administered together the propionate production was decreased. these differences are likely to be caused by changes in the microbiota composition.

the total scfa production was not affected by the use of antibiotics or antibiotics plus probiotics. when probiotics were added after using antibiotics, the scfa production increased. propionate production was decreased when antibiotics and probiotics were used together. enhanced production of lactate was observed both when probiotics were administrated together with clindamycin or when they were administered after seven days of clindamycin administration.

production of putrefactive microbial metabolites
branched chain fatty acids  and ammonia are metabolites produced from protein fermentation, a process which is generally believed to be putrefactive and leading to production of toxic metabolites. these products are deleterious for host health  <cit> .

composition of the microbiota
to determine the effects of clindamycin and the probiotics on the composition of the microbiota, the i-chip platform was used. the i-chip contained roughly  <dig> probes, some for group-level detection  and some for the detection of individual species . some groups and species were covered by more than one probe. in all cases the hybridization to these multiple probes correlated very well. however, not al probes gave a signal above background noise, which was expected, as not all microorganisms are present above the level of detection of the method . due to the different nature of each probe , hybridization intensity does not necessarily reflect abundance. difference in gc-content results in different hybridization efficiencies. although the i-chip at most is semi-quantitative, comparing signals from one and the same hybridization does allow interpretation of the increase or decrease of certain probes. for the tim- <dig> experiments samples from time points  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed.

different shades of green reflect more than  <dig>  more than  <dig> and more than  <dig> times increases of microbial species, genera or groups compared to the control, while the different shades of red reflect the more than  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times decrease of microbial species, genera or groups compared to the control.

comparing the experiments receiving clindamycin to the control experiment, the experiments with administration of clindamycin showed a decrease in bifidobacerium animalis bifidobacterium longum, crenarchaeota, enterobacteriaceae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus lactis subsp. and an increase in bifidobacterium bifidum eubacterium eligens, bacteroidetes, bactetroidales, ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus bromii and fusobacterium prausnitzii.

when clindamycin and probiotics were administered together the following species increased compared to the control: bifidobacterium animalis, enterobacter cloaca/serratia marcesens/salmonella typhi, enterococcus species, haloanaerobiale, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillaceae, lactobacillus casei and paracasei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus sakei, microbacteriaceae, nitrospirae, parabasilidea peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticum, streptococcus groups and streptococcus salivarius. bifidobacterium longum  decreased less strong than when clindamycin was administered alone.

when clindamycin was administered for  <dig> days and the probiotics were administered the week thereafter the bacteria that increased compared to the situation after antibiotic treatment alone were bifidobacterium adolescentis/bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobactrium longum, collinsella aerofaciens, enterococcus hirae, eubacterium siraeum, eubacterium xylanophilum, euryachaeota, moraxellaceae and peptostreptococcus micros. the groups that decreased were bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacteriaceae, brevibacteriaceae, campylobacter coli/jejuni, clostridium coccoides/ruminococcus productus, clostridium sporogenes, enterobacter cloacae/serratia marcesens, salmonella typhi/klebsiella penumoniae, eubacterium contortum, haloanaerobiales, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and paracasei and phascolarcobacterium faecium.

administration of clindamycin together with probiotics has positive effect on lactobacilli while the administration of probiotic after antibiotic has negative effect on same bacterial group. for the bifidobacteria this seemed to be divided in two groups, increase in one group  was observed when clindamycin together with probiotics, but not when probiotic was administated after clindamycin. decrease in another group  was observed only when probiotics were administrated after clindamycin but not in other experimental setups

statistical analyses  of the data obtained with the i-chip showed that all time point  <dig> samples clustered together  and thus could be considered equal. the sam analysis did not add new information to the other analysis performed on the i-chip data.

according to the i-chip results not all strains from the probiotic mixture increased when the mix was added to the tim- <dig> system; therefore we plated the mixture to get an idea of the amount and proportions of the bacterial strains in the mixture. the amount of bifidobacteria was very low in the mixture and only bifidobacterium longum could be identified.

after administration of clindamycin, a decrease in bifidobacteria and lactococci groups was observed, whereas in the experiment in which clindamycin was administered together with the probiotic mix, an increase in bifidobacterium animalis as well as several lactobacillus strains could be observed, and decrease of bifidobacterium longum was also less strong, decreasing from  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold.

increase in the beneficial bacterial group lactobacilli was observed when clindamycin and probiotics were administered together, while if the probiotics were administered following the administration of clindamycin the level of lactobacilli was lower. in summary, in this study we could demonstrate that the simultaneous administration of anti- and probiotics had the most significant positive effects on intestinal homeostasis by stabilizing the intestinal microbial composition, increased production of short chain fatty acids and decreasing the production of toxic microbial metabolites like ammonia and other branched chain fatty acids. we could also show that probiotics are active when applied simultaneous with antibiotics. therefore the administration of probiotics could be of significant advantage in the prevention of aad and cdi by surveillance of intestinal metabolic balance.

CONCLUSIONS
administration of vsl# <dig> parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.
