BACKGROUND
the leukocyte common antigen related receptor  is a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase which has been identified as a modulator of insulin and insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  signal transduction. in addition, it has been widely studied as a key component of neural development. the lar protein contains  <dig> immunoglobulin-like  and  <dig> fibronectin type iii-like  domains extracellularly, a transmembrane domain  and  <dig> intracellular phosphatase domains . the extracellular domains mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix  interactions. modulation of signal transduction pathways occurs via its phosphatase activity which is conferred by the first phosphatase domain  <cit> . the second is important for substrate recognition.

the expression of up to  <dig> different isoforms of the lar transcript have been postulated to result from  <dig> separate splicing variations  <cit>  within the fibronectin-like domains, proximal to the transmembrane domain and at the 3' end of the transcript. different isoforms of the lar transcript have been shown to be differentially expressed across a wide range of tissues  <cit> , during different stages of neural development  <cit>  and a specific isoform containing a distinct ectodomain in the fifth fniii domain has been found to be important in the promotion of neurite outgrowth  <cit> .

the lar induced modulation of neural growth appears to be mediated by its interaction with the nerve growth factor   <cit>  and brain derived neurotrophic factor   <cit>  signalling pathways, whilst its influence on the insulin signalling pathway may play a significant role in glucose homeostasis. this variety of functions across different tissue types suggests either a commonality of structural interaction, or a tissue specific variation in isoform expression.

through modulation of the insulin signalling pathway the lar protein has been shown to promote an insulin resistant phenotype. the lar protein physically interacts with the insulin receptor   <cit>  and promotes its de-phosphorylation  <cit>  via its cytoplasmic domains  <cit> . direct interaction between the lar protein and ir was seen to be increased with insulin treatment  <cit> . antisense knockdown of lar transcript in vitro leads to a marked elevation of ir autophosphorylation and insulin dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  activity  <cit> , whilst chinese hamster ovary  cells overexpressing lar protein show a reduction of insulin receptor  and insulin receptor  <dig>  phosphorylation  <cit> .

here we identify a novel, liver specific isoform of the rat lar transcript encoded from a 5'utr located within intron  <dig> of the full-length gene and examine the expression of this isoform in a rat model of insulin resistance induced by fetal exposure to a maternal dietary protein restriction  <cit> .

RESULTS
5'race identified a novel 5'utr within the liver expressed rat transcript
we carried out a 5'race analysis of the lar transcript, priming from within exon  <dig>  this identified a unique transcript including  <dig> bp of intron  <dig> located  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of exon  <dig>  in addition to exons 12– <dig> . the identified region was also located  <dig> bp downstream of a previously described lar alternatively spliced element . blast analysis of this region against mouse and human sequences failed to show the presence of any un-annotated exons, demonstrating that we had identified either, a novel 5'utr for a truncated transcript coding from this region or an unidentified exon.

a shortened transcript is encoded from the new 5'utr
in order to confirm the presence of this putative 5'utr within the native mrna, we carried out pcr analysis of cdna derived from rat liver. primers were designed to recognise a region within the newly identified 5'utr and a region of exon  <dig> . pcr products of  <dig> bp were expected, and bands of over  <dig> kb were observed . sequencing confirmed the presence of the 5'utr and exons 12– <dig> within the novel transcript, however, we also noted the exclusive retention of intron  <dig> , thus producing a band of  <dig> bp . the observation of a retained intron within the pcr product which had not been seen in the 5'race suggests that different forms of this novel transcript may exist.

we chose to examine the expression of the newly identified isoform in liver tissue from animals exposed to a maternal dietary protein restriction during gestation  in order to determine the contribution, if any, of the lar gene product in the development of insulin resistance in this model of metabolic programming. beta-actin was used as a loading control . from gross analysis of the pcr products, we did not see any overt differences in expression levels of any of the products described above, between animals exposed to maternal undernutrition during gestation when compared with controls. we therefore chose not to examine the expression levels in any more detail in these animals.

to demonstrate that the novel 5'utr was exclusively part of a transcript encoded from this point downstream, rather than merely an additional exon of the full-length transcript, we carried out pcr analysis of rat liver cdna using primers designed against exons  <dig> and  <dig> . the expected band of  <dig> bp was observed with no other bands visible, supporting the hypothesis that the newly identified internal 5'utr was indeed exclusively part of a transcript encoded from this point.

the newly identified transcript is expressed exclusively in liver tissue
we examined expression of the lar transcript and the newly identified isoform in a number of rat tissues in order to determine its distribution. cdna was synthesised from rna extracted from adrenal, testis, lung, colon, liver, brain, kidney, small intestine, spleen, skeletal muscle and fat, from an adult male rat supplied standard laboratory chow and tested for the presence of the newly identified transcript. we found expression of the new isoform was exclusively confined to liver  whilst the transcript identified using primers against exons  <dig> and  <dig> was observed in all tissues tested . this further confirmed that the newly identified 5'utr represents the first exon of a truncated transcript encoded from this point as it did not appear in native transcripts which include the upstream exon  <dig> 

we observed strong expression of the "full-length" transcript  in all tissues except muscle and brain, which showed lower levels of this isoform. instead, at least in brain, lar mrna was significantly represented by a shortened isoform of the "full-length" transcript. this shortened isoform was also observed, albeit to a much lesser extent, in testis, colon and small intestine . beta-actin was used to demonstrate equivalent loading .

using real-time pcr we found that the full transcript was expressed at a level approximately  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher than that of the truncated hepatic isoform.

in order to determine whether a protein product of the truncated isoform might be produced, we carried out western blotting using two different antibodies, one directed upstream of the region encoded by the transcript subsequent of the 5'utr  and another targeted downstream of this site  in a panel of tissues. probing with antibody a <dig> initially in liver and brain identified a single band of approximately  <dig> kda in both tissues, representing the processed extracellular region of the full-length protein described previously as the e-subunit , in addition to two shorter bands of approximately  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in brain. probing liver and brain using antibody a <dig> revealed a different pattern of bands . in liver, we detected bands at approximately  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, whilst in brain, we observed bands at approximately  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda. the bands seen at  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda most likely represent the internal processed p-subunit, the lar c-terminal fragment lar-ctf and the lar intracellular domain licd respectively  <cit> , demonstrating the ability of this antibody to specifically identify the lar protein. with the exception of the bands at ~ <dig> kda, all of the species described were considerably diminished in intensity or disappeared altogether when blocking peptide was incubated with the primary antibody . this additionally suggests that these bands may well represent specific lar protein targets of the antibody whilst the ~ <dig> kda bands may well be non-specific targets of antibody a <dig>  it was interesting to note two additional bands in brain tissue at approximately  <dig> kda with antibody a <dig>  non-specific proteolysis is most likely to occur in brain tissue due to the rapid rate of its degradation post-mortem, however, the lack of further, shorter bands in brain tissue, in addition to the lack of any short bands using antibody a <dig>  might suggest that these two are representative of either different brain specific isoforms, or novel processed forms of the full-length protein. it should be noted, that these bands also diminished significantly after incubation with blocking peptide .

we therefore identified two apparently liver specific bands of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda using an antibody directed downstream of the novel transcription start site. antibody a <dig>  as previously mentioned, was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1250– <dig> of the human full-length lar protein . the lar protein is processed in vivo via several cleavage events. the  <dig> kd e-subunit is produced by processing at a furin cleavage site located immediately below amino acid  <dig>  with the  <dig> kd p-subunit comprising the region downstream of this site. the  <dig> kda band identified in liver by antibody a <dig> therefore cannot be the e-subunit as the furin cleavage site is upstream of the region against which the antibody was raised and thus may represent a unique isoform of the lar protein.

in order to determine whether the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda isoforms were truly liver specific, we probed a wider panel of tissues using antibody a <dig> . most tissues examined demonstrated expression of the  <dig> kda lar-ctf  and brain tissue was again shown to express the  <dig> kda p-subunit . this antibody identified numerous bands in different tissues, some of which may well be a consequence of non-specific binding. however, we found that the  <dig> kd band  is indeed liver specific, whilst the  <dig> kd protein  is present in liver, muscle and, at very low levels, small intestine. we therefore suggest, that the  <dig> kd band identified by antibody a <dig> represents the likely protein product of the liver specific transcript which we have identified within this article. it should be noted that the e-subunit was demonstrated to be present in all tissues examined  using antibody a <dig>  confirming that the  <dig> kda band identified with antibody a <dig> was not simply a consequence of a cross reaction with the e-subunit.

we have hypothesised that the methionine at position  <dig> of the lar protein may represent the start of translation of the novel isoform. a protein including all downstream amino acids is estimated  to be approximately  <dig> kd in size. it should be noted that bioedit predicts the sequence encoding the e-subunit of the full-length lar to be approximately  <dig> kd in size. this would support the contention that the  <dig> kda band, does indeed represent the protein product of the novel liver specific transcript.

the 5'utr and the upstream region show species conservation
we proposed that, if this region represents a conserved transcriptional initiation site for a shortened transcript, then it should share sequence homology with other species. the intronic region containing the 5'utr was subject to blast analysis against mouse and human sequences. the regions identified  were then examined using the clustalw sequence alignment tool and those regions of closest homology determined.

we found an  <dig> bp conserved region of intronic dna which contained the 5'utr and extended  <dig> bp upstream encompassing the previously described lasec, plus an additional  <dig> bp 5' of lasec in addition to  <dig> bp downstream of the 5'utr . this region showed sequence homology of 95% with mouse and 82% with human. comparison of the sequence between lasec and the start of the 5'utr showed sequence homology of 97% between rat  and mouse  and 88% between rat and human .

comparison of the remaining portion of the upstream intron demonstrated sequence homology of 85% between rat and mouse and 53% between rat and human. downstream of the consensus region, the intronic sequence homology between rat and mouse was 70% whilst that between rat and human was only 56%.

for the sake of completeness, we also examined the sequence homology between species of the upstream exon  and the downstream exon .

the region upstream of the 5'utr demonstrates promoter activity
the considerable degree of homology across species supported the hypothesis that this region represents a conserved promoter. furthermore, closer examination of the promoter region revealed the presence of putative transcription factor consensus binding sites which may be important in determining its liver specific expression . we identified two e-boxes, two hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> alpha  binding sites, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element  and a camp response element . the ppre and the first hnf4α consensus sites overly each other, with the ppre on the "antisense"  strand and the hnfα site on the "sense" . we also observed a putative glucocorticoid response element upstream of the lasec containing region.

we further identified a putative caat box  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site  in addition to a potential tata binding protein  binding site located  <dig> bp upstream of the tss .

we examined the activity of this putative promoter region using a luciferase assay. regions around the 5'utr  were amplified, cloned into the pgl <dig>  luciferase expression vector and transfected into mcardle rh <dig> cells.

promoter constructs containing the complete region of homology in addition to  <dig> bp upstream  demonstrated clear promoter activity in mcardle rh <dig> cells. loss of the  <dig> bp had no effect on promoter activity as values from the full-length construct were identical to those without the additional bases . the full-length construct showed an approximately  <dig> fold increase in promoter activity over baseline values from pgl <dig>   alone . removal of the region containing lasec and  <dig> bp downstream which includes the first putative e-box , halved the activity of the promoter region , but still retained considerable activity relative to the empty vector . the loss of an additional  <dig> bp  almost completely abolished promoter activity .

these data demonstrate that the  <dig> bp homologous region possesses considerable promoter activity conferred by two distinct parts. first, the region immediately upstream of the 5'utr and secondly, by the region containing lasec.

discussion
in this study we have demonstrated the existence of a novel, liver-specific transcript of the rat lar gene. we identified a shortened isoform coding from an intronic region upstream of exon  <dig> of the lar gene. this is produced under the control of an internal promoter region located within intron  <dig> and which includes a previously identified lar alternatively spliced element . we have shown that the region identified as a putative internal 5'utr is not present within pcr products produced by priming between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that this region is not contained within the full-length transcript and therefore, that it represents the first exon of a truncated form of the gene. furthermore, expression of the newly defined transcript is exclusively confined to the liver.

a role for the lar protein has been implicated in numerous biological processes ranging from neural development to modulation of insulin signalling  <cit> . many isoforms have been identified which are expressed specifically according to both tissue type and developmental stage. the lar protein has been implicated in the modulation of the signalling pathway of a number of growth factors, including nerve growth factor   <cit> , brain derived neurotrophic factor   <cit> , insulin  <cit>  and igf <dig>  <cit> .

these studies suggest a variety of roles for the lar protein in the developing and postnatal individual which may be modulated by isoform, tissue type and pathological phenotype. we have demonstrated that expression of the shortened transcript is restricted to liver, with no evidence of expression in any other adult tissue despite the apparent widespread distribution of the full-length transcript. this would suggest that the control of expression of the newly identified isoform is under the control of liver enriched transcription factors. in addition, the liver restricted expression suggests a liver specific function for this isoform. with regard to postnatal liver function, of most relevance would be the insulin and igf <dig> pathways, we therefore hypothesise that one or both of these signalling pathways may be influenced by the newly identified isoform.

overexpression of lar protein has been shown to depress ir and irs <dig> phosphorylation in cho cells  <cit>  whilst skeletal muscle specific overexpression in the mouse, decreases glucose disposal and results in insulin resistance  <cit>  apparently mediated by reduced irs <dig> phosphorylation and irs induced pi3k activity. in humans, obesity was shown to result in a significant elevation of lar expression in skeletal muscle  <cit>  in association with considerably impaired insulin induced glucose disposal and enhanced phosphatase activity. phosphatase activity was reduced to levels seen in lean individuals only by immunodepletion of lar protein.

lar transcript knockdown in mcardle rh <dig> rat hepatoma cells  <cit>  leads to a marked elevation in ir autophosphorylation, whilst a similar loss in hek <dig> cells appears to have no effect on ir or irs <dig> phosphorylation but instead, results in post-receptor insulin resistance as evidenced by impaired akt and mapk phosphorylation  <cit> . loss of lar gene product in a mouse knockout model results in reduced fasting levels of insulin, glucose  <cit>  and igf- <dig>  <cit>  alongside elevation of igf- <dig> stimulated phosphorylation of igf-1r, irs <dig>  irs <dig> associated pi3k and extracellular signal related kinase  activity in vascular smooth muscle cells. in these same animals, absence of lar gene product is associated with a greatly enhanced proliferation of the neointima in response to arterial injury. the functional role of the lar protein appears, therefore, highly tissue specific.

the transcription start site  is preceded by two structures indicative of a classical promoter, namely a caat box  and a putative tata box . the caat box is located  <dig> bp upstream of the tss whilst the sequence tgaaaa which may bind the tata box binding protein  is located in an appropriate position  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. the promoter region appears to contain consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors relevant to the isoform's liver specific expression profile. of note are two hnf4α binding sites, a ppre and two e-boxes. all of the putative binding sites share good homology  with mouse and human . the activity of the promoter was shown to be significantly reduced with the loss of the sequence containing the first e-box  and was further diminished with the removal of the first hnf4α/ppre site . the low level of activity of the shortest promoter construct suggests that either the response elements identified within this region  are inactive, or that their activity is driven by specific cellular responses.

the presence of hnf4α binding sites may imply constitutive expression of the shortened isoform in liver, however, the additional e-boxes suggests the possibility of nutritional control of expression, particularly if the steroid response element binding protein 1c  is found to transactivate the promoter at either or both of these sites. srebp1c activity is elevated in response to glucose and insulin signalling  <cit>  and thus, expression control exerted by this protein might underlie a novel feedback loop with the insulin signalling pathway.

we examined the expression of the novel isoform of the lar transcript in an established model of developmentally programmed adult insulin resistance  <cit>  in order to identify whether this specific transcript may play a role in the development of the insulin resistant phenotype. however, we failed to observe any overt differences in expression of the newly identified shortened isoform between males from either dietary group and thus chose not to pursue this further.

in the rat, the lar gene is encoded by  <dig> exons to produce a protein possessing  <dig> igg like domains,  <dig> fniii-type domains, a transmembrane domain and two intracellular phosphatase domains   <cit> . the transcription start site of the shortened isoforms described here is located towards the end of the 5th fniii type domain and therefore it is predicted that the protein product of this isoform would only possess a limited extracellular domain. the first atg encountered when examining the truncated transcript actually exists at the end of the novel 5'utr and would be in frame with the remainder of the transcript. however, closer inspection of the homologous region in the human sequence shows this site to be represented as acg  and therefore the rat atg is likely to be a consequence of a de-amination event  <cit>  in early rodent evolution . it is, therefore, likely that the initiator methionine is encoded by the first of two adjacent atg codons located within exon  <dig>  this methionine is close to the start of the fniii- <dig> domain  as predicted by pfam analysis of the protein sequence and thus, it is anticipated that the protein product of this truncated isoform should possess the majority of the fniii- <dig> domain in addition to an unknown portion or portions of the protein downstream of this site. examination of the region around the predicted initiator methionine  shows tight homology with the classical kozak sequence . the + <dig> position relative to the start of the atg is most commonly represented by a g, however the next most frequent occurrence is an a residue. this, alongside the presence of an a in the - <dig> position, supports the assertion that the transcript encoded downstream of the novel 5'utr is translated.

importantly, we identified a liver specific band with western blotting of approximately  <dig> kda which we propose may represent the translated product of this truncated transcript. if, as we have suggested, translation begins with the methionine at position  <dig>  then this would result in the production of a protein which included part of the fniii  <dig> domain in addition to domains fniii  <dig> &  <dig>  as well as the transmembrane domain and both phosphatase domains. thus, such a protein should retain the capacity to de-phosphorylate target proteins. examination of the region immediately downstream of this methionine for the presence of a signal peptide using the signalp  <dig>  server  <cit>  failed to identify a signal sequence, possibly suggesting that the protein may not be secreted and retained within the cytoplasm, but this does not preclude its capacity to be trafficked to the plasma membrane. the truncation of the extracellular domain may influence the control of activity of this novel isoform as homophilic binding to extracellular regions  with an ectodomain isoform or a peptide mimetic of this isoform directly influences lar phosphatase activity during neural development  <cit> . the modification of the extracellular domain of this isoform may therefore influence lar protein activity in a different manner to that of the full-length protein.

interestingly, the 5th fniii domain appears to be important in the mediation of lar protein function. a short ectodomain isoform of the lar protein containing a novel shortened amino terminus in addition to the fniii- <dig> domain  was shown to act as a direct ligand of the lar protein and enable neurite outgrowth  <cit>  as was a peptide mimetic complementary to this region  <cit> . it has been suggested that the activity of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases  is regulated by homophilic interactions  <cit> , with monomeric rptps being constitutively active and dimerization leading to inactivation. thus, it was proposed that the activity of the lar protein induced by binding of the larfn5c isoform or mimetic peptide, might be mediated by preventing inactivation through homophilic binding. it is noteworthy that lar protein activity induced by ecm interactions, in particular with the laminin-nidogen complex, appears similarly to be mediated via the fniii- <dig> domain  <cit> . it remains to be seen what the nature of the complete transcript and its protein product is, in addition to the protein function and whether this is exerted intra- or extracellularly.

in summary, we have identified a novel isoform of the lar transcript which is encoded from a region within intron  <dig> and is exclusively expressed in liver. this isoform is under the control of a promoter located upstream of the newly identified 5'utr. future work will aim to understand the functional significance of hepatic expression of this new truncated isoform, in particular in relation to insulin signal transduction, in addition to the control of its expression.

CONCLUSIONS
the lar gene product is expressed in a number of isoforms and this is dependent upon tissue type. it would appear that the functional role of the lar protein may be principally determined by the isoform expressed and in particular, by the structure of the region around the fniii domains 4– <dig>  thus it may be suggested that tissue specific function is conferred by the nature of the extracellular region of the lar protein. we have identified a novel truncated isoform of the lar transcript which we have further demonstrated to be liver specific and which is expressed under the control of a promoter region possessing consensus sites for a number of liver enriched transcription factors. we propose that this represents a novel mechanism for the determination of liver specific lar protein function which, by virtue of the restriction of its expression, may prove to play a significant role in the modulation of the hepatocyte response to insulin signalling.
