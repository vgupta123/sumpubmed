BACKGROUND
one of the most frequent needs a bioinformatics end-user has is to characterize a newly produced sequence. in addition, the design and implementation of specialised bio-databases is a very frequent research activity, as demonstrated simply by accessing the nar database issue compilation  <cit> , but the main problem is keeping bio-databases updated in time. both these needs â€“ new sequence characterization and bio-database updating, are not always easy to satisfy fully. indeed, characterization of "newly produced sequences" is usually performed by applying database similarity searching methods, such as blast  <cit>  and fasta  <cit> , which are based on heuristic algorithms. the results, besides being approximate, then require further semi-automatic management in order to characterize the new sequences clearly, as regards their taxonomic and functional location. a great advantage in the "new sequence" classification procedure may be achieved by comparing new sequences with a set of already classified and grouped multialigned sequences, the grouping being based on already assigned functions and species. here we define this approach as the one-sequence vs a dataset of more multi-alignments . the rationale of the os/dnma approach has been implemented in other programs such as hmmalign within pfam  <cit>  or hoseqi and multihoseqi  <cit> , but both these approaches are protein oriented. as far as the nucleotide sequences, the already available programs based on the os/dnma approach are the classifier available through the ribosomal database project portal  <cit>  and the chiseqi  <cit>  both designed to characterize 16srrnas sequences only. this paper describes an algorithm that was designed to respond to requirements for implementing a tool for characterization of newly sequenced plant parasitic nematode rrna genes. indeed, after the ppnema database had been developed  <cit> , we had not only to demonstrate the advantage of having the ppnema database available for phytoparasite nematologists, but also to implement a ppnema updating procedure as efficient and automatic as possible. ppnema, a plant-parasitic nematode bioinformatics resource, offers the scientific community a pre-processed archive of plant parasitic nematode sequences useful for nematologists: it is a tool for retrieving plant nematode multialigned sequences for phylogenetic studies or identifying a nematode by comparing its rdna sequence with the ppnema available, genus specific multialignments . classification of a new sequence by applying blast to all the sequences available through ppnema should have required an ab-initio procedure not considering already available multialigned groups. regexpblasting , the algorithm proposed here, which compares a new sequence against a dataset of patterns derived from the application of regular expression coding to multialigned sequences, successfully solves this problem. in addition, as regards ppnema database updating, starting from the new rdna cystronic phytoparasite nematode sequences extracted through the entrez retrieval system  <cit> , available at ncbi and not yet stored in ppnema, we implemented a protocol, based on reb, which allows each new sequence to be assigned to the best matching ppnema ma. regexpblasting is not implemented only for its specific application within ppnema but, as reported below, it can be more generically applied to any set of both nucleotide and amino-acidic multi-alignments with the aim to characterize a new sequence. however we have successfully tested its usage in the application to nucleotide sequences.

RESULTS
characterization of a new phytoparasite sequence
when phytoparasite nematologists produce a new sequence, they need to classify it as regards both function and species. the application of reb through the "characterize your sequence" option available in ppnema is of great help in this case. the algorithm searches for a perfect match between the query sequence and ppnema multi-alignments. an example is shown in figure  <dig>  in which the matching region is highlighted; figure  <dig> reports the regexp pattern describing the matching ma.

use of regexpblasting for the ppnema database updating
as already emphasized in the background, in bio-database management, the main problem is to keep the databases updated in the time. we present here a procedure, based on reb, which allows the ppnema database to be updated in an almost completely automatic process. figure  <dig> reports the workflow of the entire process. the protocol starts by searching, through entrez implemented at ncbi the nematode sequences whose entry date is later than the most recent ppnema updating. the sequences are extracted by grouping them according to genus. an example of a query is "anguina  and  and 2007/01/01:2008/01/ <dig> ". the resulting entries refer to the nucleotide sequences from genera anguina, coding for one or more elements of the rna cistron and annotated after january  <dig>  <dig> and before january  <dig>  <dig>  they are extracted, and a file containing their nucleotide sequences in fasta format is submitted to "normal search", which is based on regexpblasting of each of the selected sequences against the ppnema ma dataset. each new sequence is associated with a pool of matching patterns that we call "positives"; any unclassified sequences or negative results are marked as true negatives , i.e. new group-defining sequences, and false negatives . in the first application of the protocol described here, we obviously carried out many checks in the various steps, in order to verify the efficiency of the protocol as we have designed it, and to optimize it. the positives are submitted to an automatic annotator check, which establishes if the results are true positives  or false positives . tp entries, i.e. entries matching ma of the same genera and related to various elements of the same cistron, are annotated in ppnema. the fp are submitted to an operator check and distinguished into fp due to annotation errors, e.g. erroneous species attribution, or to short conserved among-genera sequences. in the latter case, the same sequence matches several genera; thus, to solve the problem, regexpblasting can modify the minimal length parameter . by increasing the minimal length, the probability of random matches decreases, although some significant but short matches may be lost. figure  <dig> shows that the minimal length  <dig> is a good compromise, yielding as many tp as possible and minimizing the number of fn. this implied exclusion from analysis of dataset patterns whose minimal length was less than  <dig>  this value is applicable to the  <dig> phytoparasite sequences extracted. the algorithm allows minimal length to be changed dynamically, depending on the dataset in question. once the minimal length is established, the protocol is tested by submitting the fn to the scan-regexpblasting procedure, in which the parameters used are window length w, scanning step s and minimal length minl. once fixed minl to  <dig>  the results which show a cut-off  value higher than  <dig>  are selected .

we tested the procedure using window values of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and tested for each window steps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

however in the end, we fixed the scanning procedure parameters as follows: minl =  <dig>  w =  <dig>  s =  <dig> and cf =  <dig> . table  <dig> lists the results of the entire updating procedure. additional file  <dig> gives the list of  <dig> fn after normal search. additional file  <dig> reports the table summarising the results of the scan-regexpblasting procedure applied to the abovementioned fn.

data refer to application of entire regexpblasting procedure, as described in figure  <dig>  with following fixed parameters: minl =  <dig>  w =  <dig>  step =  <dig> and cut-off =  <dig> .

discussion
it has been emphasized that reb is neither an exact matching method nor a heuristic one but, thanks to careful selection of minimal length and cut-off values, as well as scanning parameters , results mainly fitting true results can be obtained. what are the limitations? one of the most difficult problems that can be avoided concerns the quality of the ma: non-optimised ma can give rise to increased numbers of false results, both positive and negative. in addition, a poor-quality ma may introduce a great number of gaps, implying reduction of minimal length, elimination of the cluster to be analysed from the dataset, and hence reduction of informative data necessary to allow positives to grow. the solution is to lower the minl value but this, as shown in figure  <dig> causes an increase in false positives. thus, in phase i it is worthwhile excluding ma which may reduce the minimal length or, more generally, the growth of false results. lastly, as regards ma, a great number of gaps inside them may lead to an increase in the cpu time of the run.

CONCLUSIONS
the results here presented and the description of the algorithm clearly show that reb is a tool with a wide range of applicability. besides the example shown here, we hypothesize that it may be used to definite advantage in barcoding  <cit>  procedures in order to identify the best matching group of sequences for a new sequence. moreover we plan to introduce this code in the hmtdb resource  <cit>  to contribute in the classification of human mitochondrial  haplogroups when a partial sequence of the human mt genome is produced. finally it will be tested in the case of sequences where alternative splicing is present, using the scan option of the reb software. we have not yet verified this hypothesis, but we are confident that it would be successful.
