BACKGROUND
human bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  represent a unique but heterogeneous population of progenitor cells  with self-renewal properties and multilineage differentiation potential  <cit> . various isolation, selection, and culture conditions have been used  in order to develop more homogeneous populations of human msc such as miami cells  <cit> , mapc, masc  <cit> , ssea-4+ msc  <cit> , cd133+ selected msc  <cit> , and rs- <dig> cells  <cit> . these sub-populations of msc are characterized by increased self-renewal potential and the ability to differentiate not only into mature cells found in mesodermal-derived tissues , but also in ectodermal-and endodermal-derived tissues .

the in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo characterization of msc requires the analysis of gene expression profiles in order to understand their underlying mechanisms of self-renewal during long term expansion, differentiation into all three germinal lineages, as well as their tissue repair properties in pre-clinical models of disease. quantitative real time rt-pcr  is often used as a tool to determine the relative change of a target genes mrna expression, which is normalized against a highly expressed and stable reference gene. due to its affordability, ease of use, and reproducibility, rt-qpcr is used widely throughout the field of msc research. however, the validity of gene expression data determined by rt-qpcr is dependent on the optimal selection of at least two or more reference genes for normalization, characterized by high expression levels and low expression variability  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to validate at least two reference genes suitable for the normalization of rt-qpcr gene expression data in msc such as miami cells under various conditions including:  low and ambient oxygen tension ,  expansion and or differentiation,  ex vivo or in vivo animal disease models,  determination of consistent gene expression profiles across several msc subpopulation and preparations. due to the varied nature of gene expression, we selected  <dig> genes involved in different cellular functions and widely employed as normalization genes in the literature. these genes include: transcript translation , cell motility/cytoskeleton , immune response/binds mhc class i , metabolism/glycolysis , nucleotide salvaging/purine synthesis , signal transduction , and protein degradation  . a previous study also showed that, ubc, rpl13a, and ywhaz are  <dig> suitable reference genes for rt-qpcr analysis of whole bone marrow aspirates  <cit> .

* used more than one normalization gene 

table#1: literature searches were conducted through pubmed central http://www.pubmed.com. representative manuscripts were selected which used quantitative real time pcr  or semi-quantitative pcr analyses for the analysis of gene expression in human bone marrow derived adult stem cells or classical msc to determine commonly used normalization "housekeeping" genes.

table#2: primer pairs preceded by  are human species specific primer pairs

heterogeneous msc and primitive more homogeneous population of bone marrow derived adult stem cell  are isolated from whole bone marrow aspirates and are a sub-fraction of the total bone marrow cell population. reviewing the literature on bone marrow-derived adult stem cell research, gapdh, actb, b2m and ef1α were found to be the most commonly used genes for normalization of rt-qpcr data . we validated the stability of the known whole bone marrow rt-qpcr reference genes ubc, rpl13a, and ywhaz  <cit> , as well as the previously mentioned genes used in msc research. we analyzed the stability and expression profile of each reference gene in miami cells using low oxygen tension , growth factor induced neural precursor enrichment, under growth factor stimulated endothelial differentiation conditions, and in an ex vivo rat hippocampal organotypic model of global cerebral ischemia. in addition, we compared the results in miami cells to another population of bone marrow-derived adult stem cells, rs- <dig> cells  <cit>  as well as commercially available msc.

adult stem cells such as bone marrow derived miami cells are a promising source for cell therapy based approaches due to their immunomodulatory properties as well as their potential to differentiate into mature somatic tissues  <cit> . they are also not burdened by ethical restrictions or problems such as partial vs. full epigenetic reprogramming, tumorgenicity potential, nor due to controversial clinical functionality associated with embryonic stem cells  and induced pluripotent stem  cells  <cit> . our study identified ef1α and rpl13a as ideal reference genes for rt-qpcr analysis of msc. these results are important because they will allow for the valid, reproducible, and comparative analysis of gene expression data in an increasingly expanding area of msc research, especially for future clinical use.

RESULTS
characterization of  <dig> putative normalization gene expression levels in miami cells
in miami cells expanded at low oxygen tension , real time quantitative pcr  analysis was used to determine the expression levels and relative fold difference between  <dig> putative normalization genes; actb, b2m, ef1α, gapdh, rpl13a, ywhaz, ubc and hprt <dig>  hprt <dig> had the lowest expression level relative to the  <dig> other genes analyzed and was set to the value of  <dig> in order to compare with the other genes. ef1α  and gapdh  had the highest relative mrna expression levels or fold difference above hprt <dig>  followed by rpl13a , ywhaz , b2m , ubc  and actb  . alpha- <dig> smooth muscle aorta actin  is another gene used for rt-qpcr normalization  but was not detected in miami cells under expansion conditions.

the average cp standard deviation was next calculated to determine the stability of gene expression. the standard deviation of the crossing point  for each gene per independent experiment  was divided by the total number of experiments minus  <dig>  . ef1α  and rpl13a  had the lowest average cp standard deviations. gapdh , which had the second highest relative expression level, had the highest average cp standard deviation between experiments. therefore of the  <dig> genes tested, ef1α and rpl13a had the highest gene stability  during the expansion of miami cells under low oxygen conditions, while gapdh had the lowest gene stability  . these results validate ef1α and rpl13a as two candidate normalization genes for rt-qpcr analysis of miami cells. additionally, the high variability of gapdh in msc derived miami cells is contradictory to its common use in human msc research .

to determine the effect of gene variability on the calculation of a target genes change in expression, we used the ΔΔcp method  <cit> . the average cp standard deviation of the normalization gene was used to determine the theoretical deviation on the target gene, calculated as relative fold difference. the calculated theoretical effects of normalization-gene variability on the target genes fold difference are as follows: ef1α ±  <dig> , rpl13a ±  <dig> , ywhaz ±  <dig> , b2m ±  <dig> , actb ±  <dig> , hprt <dig> ±  <dig> , ubc ±  <dig>  and gapdh ±  <dig> . these theoretical calculations take into account only the effect of normalization gene variability, not the additional variability of any given target gene under experimental conditions. therefore, these data show that normalization gene variability alone can impact a target genes relative fold difference during rt-qpcr analysis, as shown with the high fold variability of gapdh compared with ef1α and rpl13a.

stability of ef1α and rpl13a as a function of oxygen tension in miami cells
ef1α and rpl13a were selected as two potential normalization "housekeeping" genes based on their high expression level and their stability during the expansion of miami cells. the relative oxygen tension or partial pressure of oxygen  in bone marrow ranges from 1% to 7%, while in arteries the po <dig> can reach 10-12%  <cit> . miami cells undergo long term expansion and self-renewal at 3% po <dig>  mimicking the hypothesized in vivo niche environment, and require po <dig> of 10-21% for differentiation induction  <cit> . however, heterogeneous non-selected msc isolates are typically expanded and differentiated at 21% po <dig>  <cit> .

we tested the stability of ef1α and rpl13a in  <dig>   <dig>  21% po <dig> expansion conditions. all cell cultures were expanded for at least two passages prior to rna isolation and rt-qpcr characterization. our results showed that the average standard cp deviation of ef1α remained stable irrespective of oxygen tension  . rpl13a had a decreased average standard cp deviation at 1%  and 21%  compared with 3%  po <dig> . theoretically this would produce a change in the target genes calculated relative fold differences of ±  <dig> - <dig>  for ef1α and ±  <dig> - <dig>  for rpl13a when characterizing gene expression profiles of miami cells expanded under different po <dig> expansion conditions.

stability of ef1α and rpl13a during growth factor treatment of miami cells for neural precursor enrichment
miami cells are able to differentiate into cells typical of all three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm  <cit> . in order to increase the pool of miami neural precursor cells and efficiency of neurotrophin- <dig>  induced neuronal differentiation of miami cells  <cit> , we expanded the cells for two 5-day periods in 3% po <dig> with  <dig> ng/ml each of bfgf and egf under normal expansion conditions  <cit> . ef1α and rpl13a gene stability were tested under normal expansion, treated with bfgf alone or bfgf and egf in combination. the average cp standard deviation for ef1α  and rpl13a  decreased with pretreatment . the increased stability may be due to the formation of a more homogeneous cell population under pretreatment conditions, thereby decreasing the variability of gene expression between cell cultures and experiments.

functional assessment of ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh as normalization genes during growth factor-induced endothelial differentiation
we determined the functional use of ef1α and rpl13a compared with the commonly used gapdh as normalization genes for rt-qpcr analysis using growth factor induced endothelial differentiation of miami cells. the relative fold difference of the known endothelial marker cd <dig> , was calculated using the ΔΔcp method. the data was normalized with ef1α, rpl13a, or gapdh separately , or against the combined average after normalization against ef1α and rpl13a, or ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh together .

normalizing the rt-qpcr data against ef1α, rpl13a, or gapdh individually resulted in an increase of cd <dig> mrna expression at day ten  of,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  relative fold difference, respectively, and at day  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold difference, respectively. the increase in cd <dig> at day  <dig> normalized against ef1α or rpl13a was statistically significant . due to the extremely high standard deviation, the relative fold increase of cd <dig> at day  <dig> normalized against gapdh was not statistically significant .

we next analyzed the use of more than one normalization gene for the analysis of rt-qpcr data as recommended  <cit> . using the combination of ef1α and rpl13a as normalization genes, cd <dig> had a relative fold increase at day ten of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at day  <dig> . using ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh together as normalization genes, cd <dig> had a fold increase at day ten of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at day  <dig>  which was not statistically significant. in this model of endothelial differentiation of miami cells, the increase of cd <dig> at day  <dig> normalized against both ef1α and rpl13a was statistically significant . when you add in the use of gapdh, the fold increase of cd <dig> at day  <dig> is not statistically significant . from these results we show the functionality of ef1α and rpl13a as normalization genes for the rt-qpcr analysis of miami cells in this example of endothelial differentiation.

assessment of normalization genes used for the detection of human-specific mrna in a rat hippocampal model of oxygen-glucose deprivation
in order to assess the role of miami cells in an ex vivo model of global cerebral ischemia  it is important to be able to characterize the species-specific levels of mrna expression. we created human  and rat  species-specific primer pairs to determine the change in mrna transcript levels of human miami cells injected into rat hippocampal organotypic cultures during oxygen-glucose deprivation . primer pairs were constructed  for the human target genes; stanniocalcin  <dig> , tumor necrosis factor-inducible protein  <dig> , latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein  <dig>  and rat target genes; insulin growth factor  <dig> , insulin growth factors binding proteins  <dig> and  <dig> . normalization "housekeeping" genes were also constructed for rat rpl13a , and the previously described human specific normalization genes; hrpl13a and hywhaz, were used for normalization of human or rat rt-qpcr data .

rt-qpcr analysis of human specific mrna transcripts normalized against both hrpl13a and hywhaz, detected a  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase for hstc <dig>  htsg <dig>  and hltbp <dig> respectively . there was no detected change in higf <dig>  higfbp <dig>  and higfbp <dig> . analysis of rat specific mrna transcripts normalized against rrpl13a detected; no change in rigf <dig>  rigfbp <dig> increased  after the injection of miami cells , and rigfbp <dig> was found to decrease after induction of ogd  with no change after injection of miami cells. these data show the construction and functional use of human and rat species-specific primer pairs for the analysis of mrna expression levels in an ex vivo cross-species animal model of global cerebral ischemia and tissue repair. this technique will allow for the future analysis of msc, such as miami cells, in animal models of tissue repair and disease.

comparison of  <dig> housekeeping genes in miami cells, rs- <dig> cell, and msc
to further validate the use of rpl13a, ef1α, and gapdh as suitable normalization genes for rt-qpcr analysis we compared miami cells with commercially available msc  as well as an adult stem cell population, similar to miami cells, derived from human msc known as rs- <dig> cells   <cit> . rt-qpcr was used to determine the level  of expression for the  <dig> housekeeping genes, ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh in miami cells, rs- <dig> cells, and commercially available msc. ef1α and gapdh had the highest expression levels  in miami cells expanded at 3% po <dig> as compared with miami cells, rs- <dig> cells and commercially available msc expanded at 21% po <dig> . rpl13a had a lower average expression level  in all  <dig> cell types compared to gapdh  and ef1α . there was no statistically significance difference between the cp values of ef1α, rpl13a, or gapdh between the  <dig> cells types.

the average cp standard deviation was used to compare the stability of expression of ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh between the  <dig> cell types . ef1α and rpl13a had the lowest average cp standard deviation: between miami 3% po <dig> , miami 21% po <dig> , rs- <dig> cells  and msc . the average cp standard deviation of gapdh was higher in miami 3% po <dig> , miami 21% po <dig>  and msc . in rs- <dig> cells gapdh did have a higher average cp standard deviation  compared with ef1α and rpl13a, but the increased value was not as large as seen with miami cells and msc .

in order to determine the suitability of ef1α, rpl13a, and gapdh as housekeeping genes for comparison of the different bone marrow derived stromal cell populations described above, rt-qpcr analysis was used to compare the levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase , which is essential for the maintenance and propagation of telomeres.

normalizing against rpl13a and ef1α individually, htert mrna levels were significantly higher in miami cells expanded at 3% po <dig> compared to rs- <dig> and miami cells expanded at 21% po <dig>  normalizing the rt-qpcr data against gapdh alone showed no significant change in htert levels between the  <dig> cell types . however using both ef1α and rpl13a in combination for normalization resulted in htert mrna levels significantly  higher in miami cells expanded at low 3% po <dig>  the use of all  <dig> normalization genes, ef1α, rpl13a and gapdh together resulted in significance  when comparing htert mrna fold differences between rs- <dig> cells and miami cells expanded at 3% po <dig>  in addition, the use of all  <dig> genes for normalization resulted in a lower level of htert, with no significant difference in miami cells expanded at 3% po <dig> versus 21% po <dig> . therefore, gapdh is not a suitable rt-qpcr normalization gene either alone or in combination with ef1α and or rpl13a. whereas the use of ef1α and rpl13a allowed for the reproducible detection of htert mrna levels and both produced the same relative results used alone or in combination normalization genes .

discussion
the studies represented here show that ef1α and rpl13a are two suitable and validated housekeeping genes which can be used for the normalization of rt-qpcr data. we have shown that ef1α and rpl13a both have the lowest gene variability among  <dig> widely used normalization genes and can be used reproducibly in human bone marrow derived miami cells under various expansion and differentiation conditions including; expansion under low and high oxygen tension, endothelial differentiation and neural precursor enrichment via treatment with bfgf/egf. perhaps most important is the comparison of commercially available msc with more primitive populations of msc, such as miami and rs- <dig> cells. here we have shown that ef1α and rpl13a have low gene variability in miami cells as well as in rs- <dig> cells and in commercially available msc, and are suitable for the comparison of gene expression between msc derived populations, as shown with htert analysis. in addition, species-specific primer pairs for human rpl13a and ywhaz as well as rat rpl13a were found to be suitable for rt-qpcr analysis in the cross-species scenario of human miami cells injected into a rat hippocampal organotypic model of ischemia. ef1α was not a candidate for human-rat species-specific primer pair construction due to high sequence conservation between species.

the widely used housekeeping gene, gapdh, was found to have the highest level of gene instability out of  <dig> normalization genes tested in miami cells. moreover, we observed a decrease in significant findings when including gapdh together with rpl13a and ef1α in the normalization of cd <dig> and htert mrna analysis of miami cells, rs- <dig> cells, and msc. we conclude that gapdh is not a reliable housekeeping gene for the normalization of rt-qpcr data in human msc research, contradictory to its continued usage throughout this field of research .

msc derived primarily from the bone marrow have been examined extensively for their capacity to repair damaged tissues. the potential clinical applications of msc are diverse, besides direct differentiation of the adult stem cells into the desired mature cell type; other indirect mechanisms have been identified to play important roles in the overall repair of injured tissues, treatment of autoimmune and chronic degenerative diseases. two possible mechanisms include the production of paracrine factors or modulation of the host inflammatory response  <cit> . in order to make comparisons between heterogeneous msc populations, as well as more homogeneous adult stem cell like msc which are used in different laboratories throughout the world, it is important to have a standardized, reproducible set of housekeeping genes for rt-qpcr analysis. this will allow for the comparison between the in vitro and in vivo gene mrna expression levels which would be applicable to pre-clinical and clinical analyses of the contribution of these genes to the tissue repair process and functional outcomes.

in this study we demonstrate that ef1α and rpl13a are two suitable genes for the rt-qpcr analysis and comparison of several sources of human msc. in addition, it should be noted that this study does not and could not possibly encompass all experimental conditions or msc populations used throughout the field of msc research. with this in mind, it is important to note that prior to collecting and or analyzing rt-qpcr data, the housekeeping genes used for normalization must be validated.

CONCLUSIONS
ef1α and rpl13a are suitable genes for normalization of rt-qpcr analysis of miami cells
ef1α and rpl13a have the lowest gene variability out of  <dig> genes tested for their use as normalization genes for rt-qpcr analysis. gapdh had the highest gene variability among the  <dig> genes tested. rpl13a and ywhaz were the best two genes to use for cross-species analysis of human miami cells injected into a rat animal model of tissue damage, repair, and disease. ef1α and rpl13a are two suitable genes which should be used as the minimum normalization criteria for rt-qpcr analysis of commercially available msc, rs- <dig> cells, and miami during expansion, differentiation, and cross-species analysis.
