BACKGROUND
the rapidly accumulating complete genomes in databases provide unique opportunities to study relationships among organisms. since dna sequences are conserved between closely related organisms, comparative genomic analyses are a powerful tool for understanding the complex evolutionary events in specific phylogenetic lineages.

r. solanacearum, formerly known as pseudomonas solanacearum and burkholderia solanacearum, is the causal agent of bacterial wilt  <cit> . this soil-borne vascular pathogen is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical climates and affects an unusually broad range of crops, including both monocot and dicot plants  <cit> . many affected hosts are critical for developing countries because of their strategic importance as cash crops or as subsistence foods like potato , tomato , eggplant , cooking banana  and peanut . in the 1990s, potato brown rot strains of r. solanacearum historically known as race 3/biovar  <dig>  were introduced in europe and north america  <cit> . due to their adaptation to tropical highland climates, these strains, which are more virulent at cool temperatures  than tropical strains  <cit> , may pose major threats in temperate zones. therefore, r. solanacearum was listed as a quarantine organism in europe and canada and as a bioterrorism select agent in the u.s.  <cit> .

r. solanacearum and the closely related species r. syzygii  and the banana blood disease bacterium  form a complex in the r. picketii lineage  <cit> . this species complex includes thousands of genetically distinct strains that can differ from each other by more than 30%, and thus do not belong in the same species by conventional definition  <cit> . this species complex includes strains with broad and narrow host ranges, which are ecologically different as well: potato strains are cold-tolerant and banana strains are insect-transmitted, and with different geographic origins. because r. solanacearum strains have been isolated from virgin jungle soils in both asia and the americas, the origin of the species complex is believed to predate the geological separation of the continents  <cit> . based on analyses of the 16s-23s internal transcribed spacer  region, egl and hrpb genes and on comparative genomic hybridization , the r. solanacearum species complex is hierarchically classified in four phylogenetic groups called phylotypes, which reflect their origins as follows: asia , the americas , africa  or indonesia   <cit> . each phylotype can be further subdivided into sequevars, or sequence variants, which may contain isolates with similar virulence patterns or common geographic origin  <cit> .

despite their considerable phylogenetic diversity, r. solanacearum strains are unified by their common pathology. all cause bacterial wilt disease, which is characterized by bacterial colonization of the plant xylem vessels to very high cell densities , vascular browning, stunting, wilting, and often rapid death  <cit> . the bacterium is transmitted by soil, surface water, and infected propagation materials like potato tubers or ornamental cuttings. it most commonly infects plants through the roots, but some strains are insect-transmitted  <cit> . bacterial wilt is difficult to control because the bacterium survives for years in infested soils and weed hosts. breeding for host resistance, the best management strategy is complicated by the pathogen's high genetic diversity. for example, tomatoes resistant to r. solanacearum strains in one region are often susceptible to those in another  <cit> .

genome sequences of r. solanacearum strains can answer historic questions about what traits allow this bacterium to be such an aggressive and lethal pathogen of so many different plants, and to survive in such different habitats as soil, water, non-host plant rhizospheres and host xylem vessels. the bi-partite genome of r. solanacearum strain gmi <dig>  was sequenced and analyzed  <cit>  . the genome has two replicons, called the chromosome and the megaplasmid, with a mosaic structure that implies many rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. several factors have been shown to contribute to bacterial wilt virulence, especially the type iii secretion system  and associated effectors  <cit> , and production of extracellular polysaccharides and enzymes  <cit> . the gmi <dig> genome encodes more than a hundred ttss effectors or putative effectors  <cit> . draft genomes are available for two additional r. solanacearum strains: ipo1609/uw <dig>  which cause potato brown rot disease in cool-temperate climates and molk <dig>  which causes moko disease of banana and plantain  <cit> . these respectively belong to phylotype iib sequevar  <dig>  and sequevar  <dig> .

to better understand how this highly diverse and scattered species complex has evolved and diverged without losing its fundamental pathological qualities, we sequenced the genomes of three additional broad host range strains from other phylotypes, namely: american strain cfbp <dig> , african strain cmr <dig>  and indonesian strain psi <dig> . all were originally isolated from tomato. their complete genomes were manually annotated and analyzed with the aim of investigating the conserved, variable, and specific gene repertoires of these strains and the three previously sequenced ones, with a special emphasis on genes involved in virulence and pathogenicity. in addition, the genomes of  <dig> r. solanacearum strains  were compared by cgh on a pan-genomic microarray. these comparative genomic approaches produced new insights into the evolution and taxonomy of the r. solanacearum species complex.

RESULTS
it has long been known that r. solanacearum is a highly heterogeneous group of strains and thus no one genome sequence could represent the entire species complex. initial genomic studies revealed that r. solanacearum strains have a substantial backbone of common housekeeping and virulence functions, but also carry a divergent set of genomic modules that likely confer distinct ecological phenotypes and host specificity  <cit> . comparing multiple bacterial genomes distributed around the phylogenetic tree was therefore essential to understand the evolutionary driving forces and mechanisms that have produced such a phenotypically and genotypically diverse group. four existing genome sequences represented phylotype i  and phylotype ii   <cit> . the phylotype-sequevar subclassification system provided rational criteria for choosing more strains to sequence to cover significant additional diversity in the species complex. we therefore sequenced genomes of strains that cause bacterial wilt of tomato from indonesia , cameroon , and the french west indies .

overview of genomes of cfbp <dig>  cmr <dig> and psi07
the two-replicon  genome architecture of these three tomato strains was identical to that found in the three previously sequenced strains. as in the gmi <dig> genome  <cit> , most -but not all- housekeeping genes were carried on the chromosome. however, the capture or creation of the megaplasmid by ralstonia spp. appears to be an ancient event, since all strains in the r. pickettii lineage studied to date have two replicons . moreover, cgh microarray analyses by guidot et al.  <cit>  established that both replicons have a long history of coevolution within the r. solanacearum species complex.

the sizes of the chromosomes and megaplasmids, and therefore the entire genome, are similar in all strains the average genome size for the sequenced r. solanacearum strains was approximately  <dig>  mb including the chromosome  and the megaplasmid  . additional data on genome characteristics are provided in supplemental material . r. solanacearum strains cfbp <dig>  cmr <dig> and psi <dig> had genome lengths of  <dig> , <dig> bp,  <dig> , <dig> bp and  <dig> , <dig> bp, respectively, with a common average g+c content of  <dig> % in both replicons. with an average protein coding density of  <dig> %, chromosomes contained about  <dig> predicted coding sequences , and megaplasmids contained about  <dig>  only one rrna operon was detected in each r. solanacearum genome, except in strains gmi <dig> and cmr <dig>  which had  <dig> and  <dig> rrna operons, respectively. additional ribosomal operons can permit faster adaptation to new environmental conditions by increasing protein synthesis capacity  <cit> . in cmr <dig>  two rrna operons were on the chromosome and one on the megaplasmid; gmi <dig> has three on the chromosome and one on the megaplasmid. the three cmr <dig> rrna operons were  <dig> % identical at the nucleotide level. fifty-nine,  <dig> and  <dig> trna genes were identified in strains cfbp <dig>  cmr <dig> and psi <dig>  respectively.

data for chromosomes and megaplasmids are combined. for more details, see table s <dig>  

automatic re-annotation of the r. solanacearum sequences in the public domain identified  <dig> additional coding sequences  in gmi <dig> . these newly identified genes, encoding mostly proteins of unknown function, were encoded 'ralso' to distinguish them from previously-annotated cds .

the r. solanacearum pan-genome
the new genome sequences from strains cmr <dig>  cfbp <dig> and psi <dig> were combined with existing sequences from strains gmi <dig>  ipo <dig>  and molk <dig> to identify a total of  <dig> unigenes which constitute the known pan-genome of r. solanacearum: that is, the set of all genes present in a group of organisms. the pan-genome is composed of the core-genome , the dispensable genome  and the specific genome   <cit> . as reported in figure  <dig>  among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were highly conserved ) in the six genomes and constituted the r. solanacearum core-genome, which thus makes up 28% of the pan-genome. ninety-three percent of the core genome cds were located on the chromosome. the dispensable genome contained  <dig> genes . this is in general agreement with a previous conserved genome estimate of  <dig> genes that was based on cgh analyses of  <dig> strains  <cit> . the overestimate by the cgh approach is probably due to nonspecific hybridizations and lower technical precision of hybridization compared to sequencing. the number of strain-specific genes was variable, ranging from  <dig> for molk <dig> to  <dig> for gmi <dig> . for these six r. solanacearum strains, a total of  <dig> genes were identified as strain-specific genes, which represents a third of the current pan-genome. depending on the strain, the number of proteins of unknown function  encoded by the strain-specific genes ranged from  <dig> to 84% in. these genes likely hold many clues to the traits and mechanisms underlying the biological diversity of the r. solanacearum species complex, but because so few of these cds can be functionally annotated, gene by gene mutagenesis and phenotype analysis will be needed to determine their roles.

genome plasticity and genomic islands
working from the gmi <dig> genome, we identified syntenic cds in all six r. solanacearum genomes and also in some bacterial species most closely related to the r. picketii lineage . the six r. solanacearum genomes were highly syntenic:  <dig> to 65% of the cds on the megaplasmid and  <dig> to 80% of the cds on the chromosome were in synteny. this percentage decreased to below 55% on the chromosome and 20% on the megaplasmid in other closely related species, except for r. picketii, where  <dig> and 40% of cds, on the chromosome and the megaplasmid respectively, were in synteny with gmi <dig>  r. pickettii is closely related to, but not a member of the r. solanacearum species complex; both belong to the r. pickettii lineage   <cit> . cupriavidus spp. and r. eutropha are the closest relatives to the r. pickettii lineage, but in these genomes the number of cds in synteny with gmi <dig> was dramatically lower on both replicons. further, the size of syntenic regions was greater within the r. solanacearum species complex; an average of  <dig> to  <dig> cds per synton was observed on chromosomes of these strains . the exception was the african strain, cmr <dig>  where we found an average of  <dig> cds per synton with gmi <dig>  for the other related species, the mean number of cds in one synton was fewer than  <dig>  for all comparisons, we found that the megaplasmids always contained fewer cds in synteny than the chromosomes. multiple alignments of r. solanacearum genomes revealed that many genomic rearrangements occurred in the history of these organisms, including intra- and inter-replicon rearrangements .

r. solanacearum is naturally competent for dna transformation  <cit>  which allows cells to acquire foreign genetic material directly from their environment. nakamura et al  <cit>  estimated that nearly 16% of gmi <dig> genes were horizontally transferred. genomic islands are parts of genomes that display evidence of horizontal acquisition. they have a minimal length of  <dig> kb and contain cdss with no bbh and no synteny with genomes of compared organisms. table s <dig>  provides a complete list of the numerous genomic islands detected in cfbp <dig>  cmr <dig> and psi <dig>  and a schematic representation of genomic island locations is given in figure  <dig>  the density of genomic islands was two-fold greater on megaplasmids than on chromosome. many of these genomic islands were is or phage sequences containing almost exclusively proteins of unknown function. however, some genomic islands carried type iii effectors , including, in cmr15: gala <dig>  an unknown effector, similar to other gala effectors ; popp <dig> ; as well as putative effectors . two supplementary rrna operons  and noszrdfyl, an operon involved in the anaerobic denitrification pathway  were also located on genomic islands in cmr <dig>  in psi <dig>  three putative type iii effectors were detected on chromosomal genomic islands  and one on the megaplasmid . in cfbp <dig>  only two putative effectors were detected in genomic islands . these results are still too fragmentary to determine any relationship between host ranges and the presence or absence of repertoires of specific effectors. however, acquisition of new effectors could theoretically contribute to rapid adaptability and diversification, especially in virulence and aggressiveness, as well as to saprophytic fitness.

interestingly, the megaplasmids of cfbp <dig> and psi <dig> also harbor a genomic island containing the rhi operon. this operon was composed of  <dig> genes: rhib , rhic , rhii , rhid , rhih , rhie , rhif , rhia  and rhig . the rhi genes were previously unknown in ralstonia strains, but are present in pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit>  and in burkholderia rhizoxinica where they encode a non-ribosomal peptide synthase  that synthesizes the antimitotic toxin rhizoxin  <cit> . although this operon spans more than  <dig> kb, it could have been horizontally acquired since r. solanacearum can exchange and integrate dna fragments of  <dig> to  <dig> kb by natural transformation  <cit> . the insertion of such a toxin operon in the genome of r. solanacearum could provide a competitive advantage in the soil environment.

comparison of some metabolic properties
to better understand metabolic diversity among the sequenced strains, we used principal compenents analysis , a type of factorial analysis that analyzes a data matrix by several quantitative variables  <cit> . we applied pca to a matrix describing the completion  of all known metabolic pathways present in the six r. solanacearum genomes . the first two resulting factors captured over 67% of the data's total variability. the axes were interpreted with the help of external information, such as each strain's host, phylotype, and the laboratory of annotation. the first factorial axis separated strain gmi <dig> from the five other strains. this result accounted for the metabolic functions corresponding to the red-colored vectors. the list of pathways that these vectors represent can be consulted in table s <dig> a and b , and generally have a maximum of two or three reactions. none of these pathways appear to be complete in gmi <dig>  this suggests that this factorial axis is in fact an artifact of insufficient or erroneous enzymatic function annotations. this should help guide future annotation efforts. the second factorial axis separated the strains according to their hosts: banana and potato for molk <dig> and ipo <dig>  and tomato for psi <dig>  cmr <dig> and cfbp <dig>  as would be expected, molk <dig> and ipo <dig>  which are close together in the factorial plane, actually belong to the same phylotype .

careful examination of the metabolic potential of the studied genomes has revealed some specificity capabilities for compound degradation. although r. solanacearum is a highly adapted and ancient plant pathogen, this organism can also survive well in soil and rhizospheres and, consequently, its genome encodes ability to metabolize diverse organic compounds as energy sources. pathway analyses indicate that this bacterium can utilize a wide range of substrates including amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids as well as glycerol, ethanol, methylglyoxal, and beta-ketoadipate . gmi <dig> was predicted to grow on various aromatic compounds including ferulate, vanillate, and protocatechuate  <cit> , which are released when lignin degrades in soil. however strains cmr <dig> and gmi <dig> do not harbour the benabcd and catabc genes involved in benzoate and catechol degradation to beta-ketoadipate. another contrasting example is d-galactonate degradation, which can serve as energy and sole carbon source for many enteric bacteria  <cit> . in soil, bacteria such as azotobacter vinelandii and sinorhizobium meliloti convert d-galactose to d-galactonate via the de ley-doudoroff pathway, and finally to d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. our data indicate that d-galactonate degradation is functional only in strains gmi <dig>  cmr <dig> and psi <dig> . however, this substrate must be taken up whole from the environment because no degradation enzymes upstream in the pathway were apparent in these genomes. curiously, it seems that the d-galactonate transport system is different in cmr <dig>  which harbors only one likely transport gene in the corresponding synton, and in gmi <dig> and psi <dig>  which each have  <dig> genes highly similar to the l-arabinose abc transporter .

urease, which is necessary for utilization of urea as sole nitrogen source, has three main subunits and five accessory proteins. genetic determinants for this enzymatic activity were found in all strains except molk <dig>  the only banana wilt pathogen sequenced to date. all six strains appear able to metabolize inorganic nutrients such as sulfate and nitrate, consistent with experimental data  <cit> . however, the denitrification pathway was complete only in strains gmi <dig> and cmr <dig>  because the nosz gene encoding nitrous oxide reductase was absent from the four other strains; this heterogeneity was previously noted  <cit> . genes for periplasmic nitrate reductase , nitrate reductase , nitric oxide reductase  and nitrite reductase  were present on the megaplasmids of all six sequenced r. solanacearum strains.

finally, all six genomes contain genes involved in the detoxification of noxious compounds and in metal resistance, which likely support colonization and survival in specific ecological niches. an interesting example is arsenic resistance which in bacteria is mediated in part by ars genes. among these, arsc encodes an arsenate reductase , arsa and arsb encode an arsenite efflux pump, and arsr encodes a transcriptional regulator  <cit> . as is known to induce oxidative stress, to cause dna damage, and to inhibit the dna repair system  <cit> . it is generally further oxidized by the arsenite oxidase  encoded by aoxab genes. the arsc gene is the sole gene in this pathway present in all six strains, with two tandem copies in psi <dig>  in addition, only psi <dig> can oxidize arsenite: on the psi <dig> megaplasmid is a cluster containing two arsc genes, aoxab, and arsr. the annotation of the arsc-like gene is probably erroneous in the other ralstonia species .

virulence factors
many traits contribute to virulence of r. solanacearum strains. the best known are the type iii secreted effectors, well described in this bacterium and in other plant pathogens  <cit> . however, other traits, such as production of eps and cell wall-degrading enzymes, are also important for wilt disease development. based on the literature, we created an inventory of  <dig> genes involved in virulence from the six sequenced r. solanacearum genomes . some genes are involved in swimming motility, twitching motility and chemotaxis. table s <dig> gives a representative pair of genes for each of those functions. virulence genes were subdivided into  <dig> categories: type iii effectors  and putative effectors, the exopolysaccharide  biosynthetic genes, the cell wall-degrading enzyme  genes, response to host defence genes and key virulence regulators. scrutiny of the genomes shows that all six strains have all genes needed for functional type ii and iii secretion systems. similarity distances between each sequenced strain were computed on the basis of gene presence/absence data for these  <dig> virulence genes . phylogenetic analysis constructed on the basis of: 1) all known or putative type  <dig> effector genes in the pan-genome, and 2) all known virulence factor genes of all kinds in the pan-genome, resulted in trees that were significantly different from each other, and significantly different from trees based on well-conserved genes like muts and egl sequences, or on the entire genome sequences . this result suggests that virulence factor genes have evolved or been lost or added at substantially different rates than r. solanacearum genes as a whole. a more fine-scale case-by-case analysis will likely be needed to trace the evolutionary history of individual virulence traits. analysis of strains hosted by plants phylogenetically distant from tomato  may elucidate roles of individual virulence factors in determining host range.

type iii-secreted effectors are an important potential source of host range variability in r. solanacearum strains; these have mainly been described in gmi <dig> and uw <dig> to date  <cit> . specific effectors that are important in cmr <dig>  cfbp <dig> and psi <dig> are unknown. we attempted to detect new type iii effectors with the effective software  <cit> , but this did not work well for r. solanacearum strains, giving about 50% false negative on previously annotated effectors .

plasmids in ralstonia solanacearum strains
genin and boucher  <cit>  suggested that the presence of small plasmids in r. solanacearum cells, initially described by morales and sequeira  <cit> , was more an exception than a rule. however, we found small plasmids  in the african and indonesian strains. these plasmids were named prsc <dig>  in strain cmr <dig> and prsi <dig>  in strain psi <dig>  the presence of small plasmids is therefore maybe less rare in r. solanacearum strains than previously thought. these small plasmids may have remained undetected until now because their very low copy number makes them difficult to purify .

despite their low copy numbers, the stability of these plasmids is apparently ensured by two different toxin/antitoxin  systems. on prsc <dig>  two cds had a limited homology with zeta-toxin and epsilon-antitoxin , which form a post-segregational mechanism for plasmid maintenance in bacteria  <cit> . the regulator ω was not detected in the cmr <dig> genome. this zeta/epsilon ta system is well described and a similar system confers a bactericidal effect on bacillus subtilis, and bacteriostatic effects on e. coli  <cit> .

the plasmid prsc <dig> was broadly syntenic with plasmids from many plant-associated bacteria including pxcb of xanthomonas citri pv. aurantifolii , diverse p. putida plasmids , a x. citri pv. citri plasmid  and a plasmid from x. euvesicatoria . among the  <dig> cds present on this plasmid ,  <dig> appeared to be involved in the type iv secretion system:  <dig> genes make up the virb operon  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp, and four genes form the tra operon  from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp. eight cds coded for proteins potentially involved in dna metabolism . finaly, one cds had a strong homology to a zn-metalloprotease , also carried on plasmids in several human and/or animal pathogenic bacteria or opportunistic bacteria: p. putida, yersina pestis, escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, etc. metalloproteases like those encoded on prsc <dig> are essential for the infection process of many eukaryotes  <cit> .

the unexpected type iv secretion system is unique among r. solanacearum strains studied to date and could play diverse important roles in virulence and adaptation. the cmr <dig> type iv secretion system genes, which are clustered together with the virb operon, have nearly the same organization as on pxac <dig> of xanthomonas citri pv citri  <cit> . the type iv secretion system is a bacterial conjugation apparatus  <cit>  and the dna thus efficiently imported through the cell envelope can directly increase the fitness or virulence of bacteria by mediating the acquisition of new traits like effectors or antibiotic resistance genes. type iv secretion systems can also be directly involved in virulence via direct injection of effectors or dna into plant cells  <cit> . no obvious type iv effectors were found on prsc <dig> or in the complete genome of cmr <dig>  but some proteins of unknown function could be type iv effectors. additional experiments are needed to investigate  the distribution of this plasmid in african phylotype iii strains,  the ecological and pathogenic role of this plasmid in the phenotype of phylotype iii strain cmr <dig>  and  the occurrence of such plasmids in strains belonging to other phylotypes.

a second low-copy number plasmid, prsi <dig>  was present in psi <dig>  it was syntenic with a plasmid found in nitrobacter hamburgensis x <dig> , burkholderia pseudomallei  <dig> and  <dig> , parvibaculum lavamentivorans ds- <dig> , acidovorax sp. js <dig>  and e. coli pola <dig> . prsi <dig> contained  <dig> cds,  <dig> of which encoded for proteins of unknown function and one for a putative transcriptional regulator. other prsi <dig> cds coded for proteins putatively involved in dna metabolism or conjugation . thus, the functional annotation reveals no obvious role for this plasmid in either the ecology of the bacteria  or during pathogenesis. the maintenance of this plasmid seems likely due to the ta system rather than to increased fitness.

new insight into the phylogeny of the r. solanacearum species complex
genomes were compared pairwise using the average nucleotide identity  calculation ; the dendrogram summarizes the results, which grouped together strains gmi <dig>  and cmr <dig> , with ani values above 96%. new world  strains cfbp <dig>  molk <dig> and ipo <dig>  were likewise clustered together . indonesian strain psi <dig> was closest to the phylotype ii group, but the ani values between psi <dig> and any other strain were always less than 95%. the topology of the species complex phyogenetic tree computed from ani values was fully consistent with that observed in previous trees computed with cgh microarray data  <cit>  and with muts and hrpb sequences  <cit> . thus, working with a smaller number of strains but with much more data per strain, these genome sequences confirm the phylotype classification scheme and their phylogenetic position, i.e. phylotype i is closest to phylotype iii, and phylotype iv is closest to the phylotype iia and iib. kanstantinidis and tiedje  <cit>  and goris et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ani values above 95% are equivalent to the 70% dna-dna hybridization cut-off value traditionally used to differentiate bacterial species. using this standard, our data identify three evolutionarily distinct groups within the r. solanacearum species complex: gmi1000-cmr15; cfbp2957-ipo1609-molk2; and strain psi <dig>  separate ani analysis of replicons gave the same result as whole genome analyses . as proposed by stakebrandt et al  <cit> , genomic data can be used to propose new species, provided that there is sufficient congruence with dna-dna reassociation.

we used cgh of a spotted microarray reflecting the pan-genome of gmi <dig>  ipo <dig>  and molk <dig> to further define phylogenetic relationships among a set of  <dig> strains selected to span the known diversity within the species complex, and to verify that the three new genomes selected were truly representative of their respective phylotypes. hierarchical clustering of these  <dig> strains  differentiated five clusters, which each cluster matching to a phylotype . this dendrogram is fully congruent with the validated phylogeny of the species complex  <cit>  and deepens a previous analysis performed on a smaller set of strains with a less complete cgh microarray based only on the gmi <dig> genome  <cit> . furthermore, the position of each sequenced strain within its own phylotype cluster allowed us to extend ani results to the other  <dig> strains. the taxonomy of the species complex can now be reviewed based on these consistent results from several different techniques. the analyse of genetic distance between genome sequences of much strain, especially in phylotype iv, should be decisive, but our cgh data suggest that there is a solid phylogenetic basis for dividing this group into three species, according to the phylotype scheme: one species containing phylotype ii, a second containing phylotypes i and iii, and a third containing r. solanacearum strains from phylotype iv.

CONCLUSIONS
we compared the genome organizations and gene repertoires from six phylogenetically distant and phenotypically divergent strains from the r. solanacearum species complex. these strains shared many structural and genotypic traits observed in the first sequenced strain of r. solanacearum, gmi <dig>  our results significantly expanded the known r. solanacearum pan-genome, identifying thousands of genes that more sharply define the common core, the dispensable and the specific  genomes. however, the genomes differed quite significantly. our ani and other analyses suggest that this large and heterogeneous species complex spans enough variation that it could be reclassified into at least three distinct taxonomic groups, which each have the equivalent of more than 30% divergence from the other two at the dna-dna hybridization level. post-genomic mining of this pan-genome can combine comparative tools like cgh microarrays with phenotypic experiments to determine the distribution and the biological functions of likely traits identified with in silico analyses. such combined approaches will increase our understanding of the evolutionary past, the phylogeography, and the biological specialization of r. solanacearum species complex strains. although four of the six strains sequenced to date were isolated from tomato plants, our analysis did not identify any variations in previously known virulence factors that were unique to tomato pathogens. this could be explained by either 1) an insufficiently large sample of non-tomato pathogen genomes or 2) a biological unity in the core mechanisms of bacterial wilt across all r. solanacearum species complex members, with host specificity and ecological adaptations conferred by traits that remain to be identified. sequencing of additional species complex members that infect highly divergent plant hosts such as clove trees and plantains will offer additional insights into the traits that confer host specificity on bacterial wilt pathogens.
