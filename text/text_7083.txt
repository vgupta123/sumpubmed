BACKGROUND
the hessian fly  is an important insect pest of wheat . as a member of the gall midge family  it belongs to the dipteran suborder nematocera, which also includes mosquitoes, midges, black flies and fungus gnats. widespread outbreaks of the hessian fly occur at irregular intervals in many parts of the world  <cit> . in the united states local outbreaks cause extensive losses nearly every year. the status of the hessian fly as an agricultural pest, its behavior and its evolutionary relationship to other insects make it an excellent candidate for genome sequencing.

the complexity of the hessian fly genome is manifested by the presence of two distinct classes of chromosome: e chromosomes and s chromosomes  <cit> . the e chromosomes vary from  <dig> to  <dig> in number, and are germ line limited. the composition of these chromosomes is still unknown. it has been hypothesized that they function to provide additional copies of genes required for oocyte and embryonic development  <cit> . it has also been suggested that they are largely composed of parasitic dna adapted to the hessian fly's post-zygotic mechanism of establishing x chromosome number, as described below  <cit> . the s chromosomes compose the more conventional portion of the hessian fly genome and are present in both the germ line and the soma. they consist of two autosomes  and two x chromosomes . the s chromosomes contain the genes that are necessary for the housekeeping and specialized functions associated with each somatic cell type, including the avirulence  genes and other genes that are important in the insect's interactions with wheat. a haploid complement of s chromosomes consists of approximately  <dig> mb of dna  <cit> . the x chromosomes compose approximately 46% of the s genome. a preliminary understanding of the composition and structure of the s genome would be imperative for a whole genome sequencing effort.

chromosome imprinting and chromosome elimination are both involved in the anomalous behavior of the hessian fly genome  <cit> . all hessian fly zygotes begin life with a diploid set of s chromosomes and a complement of e chromosomes. chromosome imprinting is evident as the e chromosomes and the paternally derived s chromosomes are eliminated from the primary spermatocytes during spermatogenesis. there is no genetic recombination in males. thus, every spermatoctye contains only the maternally derived set of s chromosomes. chromosome imprinting is also evident when the male and female somatic karyotypes are established. during the fifth nuclear division of the embryo, the e chromosomes are eliminated from all presumptive somatic nuclei  <cit> . a male somatic karyotype  is established if the paternally derived x <dig> and x <dig> chromosomes are eliminated from the presumptive somatic nuclei along with the e chromosomes. a female somatic karyotype  is established if the paternally derived x chromosomes are maintained in the presumptive somatic nuclei when the e chromosomes are eliminated. x-chromosome elimination is controlled by maternal genotype. thus, most female hessian flies produce families that are either all female or all male.

wheat breeders and wheat geneticists have worked for decades to discover and incorporate cultivar-specific hessian fly resistance genes into wheat in an effort to manage this pest  <cit> . unfortunately, their many successes have been limited by the evolution of hessian fly genotypes that are unaffected by those resistance genes. by investigating the genetics of this problem  <cit>  and by virtue of its similarity to the genetics of certain obligate bacterial and fungal plant pathogens  <cit> , the following working hypothesis has emerged  <cit> : hessian fly and wheat have a gene-for-gene relationship whereby loss-of-function mutations in certain hessian fly genes  enable the flies to overcome the resistance conferred by specific alleles of a corresponding set of genes  in wheat. for example, mutations in the avr gene vh <dig> permit the survival of larvae feeding on wheat genotypes carrying the r allele h <dig>  hessian fly larvae lacking those mutations die as they attempt to feed on the same wheat genotypes. at least  <dig> r genes have been discovered in wheat  <cit> . avr genes corresponding to  <dig> of these r genes have been genetically mapped in the hessian fly genome  <cit> . although neither r genes in wheat nor avr genes in the hessian fly have been cloned, genetic analysis suggests that the wheat genes for hessian fly resistance encode receptors that interact, alone or in concert with other factors, with the products of the hessian fly avr genes. this interaction elicits a biochemical cascade that results in plant resistance and the death of hessian fly larvae attempting to feed on the plant. recessive mutations in the avr genes appear to enable the insect to avoid detection by the plant. this leads to larval survival and plant damage on plants that would otherwise be resistant to hessian fly attack. the evolutionary and functional characterization of important hessian fly genes, such as avr genes, would include an understanding of their functional and evolutionary relationships to homologues in sequenced genomes.

we discovered markers sufficiently close to vh <dig> to attempt chromosome walking for the purpose of cloning, for the first time, an avr gene from an insect  <cit> . two bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries were constructed and walking began in both directions from the most tightly linked dna marker . though the libraries lacked clones containing segments of the genome between vh <dig> and 22– <dig>  we generated a contig of approximately  <dig> mb in the opposite direction. our objectives in the present study were to better understand the molecular structure and composition of this genome using the sequence information garnered. we correlate physical and genetic distance in this region of the hessian fly genome, and evaluate this segment of dna for structural and genetic similarities to the sequenced dipteran genomes of the fruit fly, d. melanogaster, and the malaria mosquito, a. gambiae. this serves as an effective platform towards a whole genome sequencing effort as well as enables an understanding of the functional and evolutionary relationships between these  <dig> dipterans.

RESULTS
chromosome walk
chromosome walking was initiated by screening the bac libraries with sts marker eac/mcac- <dig> . three clones were identified in the mde library and none in the hf library. a chromosome walk then proceeded in one direction while walking in the opposite direction was prevented by an absence of clones in both libraries . in the direction in which walking was possible,  <dig> steps were taken, identifying an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> clones per step and a total of  <dig> bac clones. fish was performed after each step to confirm that the clones were located on the short arm of chromosome x <dig> . to determine the orientation and relative lengths of overlapping bac clones in the walk, a pcr-based method was used. this method utilized oligonucleotides designed after the sequences of bac-end fragments as primers  and bac clone dna as template. fiber fish experiments were performed to determine if the walk resulted in a single contig of hessian fly genomic dna . bac clones representing each step in the walk were used as probes in these experiments. they conclusively demonstrated that a single contig was identified. they were further used to estimate the lengths of the  <dig> clones and their overlap in the contig . the fiber-fish determined bac lengths were slightly greater  than those made by chef gel electrophoresis . the entire contig had an estimated length of  <dig> kb.

the orientation of the contig with respect to the genetic map was determined using sts markers developed and positioned on the genetic map in a previous investigation  <cit> , and a new marker developed from the dna sequence at the sp <dig> end of bac clone mde47o <dig>  the bac clones containing each of these markers were identified in separate pcr experiments that used each bac clone as template and with the primers of each marker . the relative positions of the sts markers in the contig were determined with these data . this analysis clearly showed that the contig extended in the direction away from vh <dig>  and that the relative positions of the sts markers on the genetic map corresponded with their relative physical positions in the contig. the lengths of the bac clones that contained each sts marker and the overlap of those clones with adjacent clones in the contig were used to determine the limits of the sts marker positions  in the contig . these limits were then used to determine the minimal and maximal distances between each pair of sts markers in the contig . these values were then used to estimate the physical distance between each pair of markers. these values generally fell below  <dig> cm/mb, but ranged from  <dig>  to an unusually high  <dig> cm/mb.

bac clone mde8i18
to obtain sequence for a genomic analysis of the contig, a relatively small bac clone within the contig was selected for sequencing. sequences generated from the selected clone, mde8i <dig>  clone were assembled into a  <dig>  bp contig  . this contig has a minimum of 5× coverage  and > 20× sequencing coverage on average. mde8i <dig> had a g+c content of  <dig> %. the assembled sequence had  <dig> simple repeats . no transposon sequences were found in this genomic segment.

six putative coding regions  were found following exon prediction  and database searches. a similarity-based search of a hessian fly expressed sequence tag  database identified an est  that corresponded to predicted peptide mde8i18_ <dig>  there were  <dig> predicted transcripts  in this sequence . predicted transcripts were compared to nucleotide and protein databases for putative functional assignment.

putative peptides mde8i18_ <dig> and mde8i18_ <dig> were partial predictions and were at either end of the bac clone , and did not demonstrate similarity to proteins in the database. predictions mde8i18_ <dig> and mde8i18_ <dig> had no identifiable protein domains. three other predictions had significant hits to proteins in the anopheles and drosophila genomes. the anopheles and drosophila sequences with the greatest similarity to mde8i18_ <dig> and mde8i8_ <dig> were orthologs of each other  <cit> . mde8i18_ <dig>  was similar to the drosophila gcn <dig> gene  and to its anopheles ortholog – xm_ <dig>  mde8i18_ <dig> belongs to the vinculin family of proteins and its putative ortholog was the a. gambiae alpha-catenin-related gene  and the d. melanogaster cg <dig> gene. this hessian fly sequence had two hits in both the drosophila and anopheles genome with putative orthologs having a significantly better e value. the anopheles and drosophila genes were orthologs of each other while the second hits in each genome were orthologs as well. to verify the results, the phylogenetic analysis included the human orthologs of these genes as well as the anopheles white gene as an outgroup . mde8i18_ <dig> had leucine-rich repeats  and possessed significant similarity to the toll family of proteins. this sequence was almost identical to a hessian fly est, lg2d <dig> .

bac clone end sequences 
to obtain additional sequence with which to make further comparisons, the end sequences of  <dig> bac clones in the contig were determined. this effort resulted in  <dig> high quality bac end sequences   with an average length of  <dig> bp after vector removal and end-trimming. sequencing failures were attributed to low bac dna yield. some bess were found to overlap with each other and the fully sequenced mde8i <dig> sequence. these overlaps served to anchor the ends of these bacs. all other bess represent  <dig>  bp of non-overlapping unique sequence contained within the contig. this value is ~ <dig> kb when mde8i <dig> bac sequence is included representing approximately 10% of the entire contig. these sequences have an overall g+c% of 32%, approximately the same as that seen for the mde8i <dig> sequence.

hessian fly putative ortholog determination was based on similarity of protein sequence. orthologs are genes in different species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation and usually retain the same function. identification of orthologs is critical for reliable prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes. to minimize the level of false positives, putative orthologs had to meet a strict set of requirements . eleven bes had significant similarity  to proteins in the anopheles and drosophila genomes . with the exception of mde8i18_ <dig>  and mde8i18_ <dig>  all tblastn searches recovered only  <dig> significant hit in each genome. there were  <dig> sequences that had similarity to genes that belonged to single gene families in both the anopheles and drosophila genomes . these hessian fly sequences included bess mde29l21_sp <dig>  mde5j15_sp <dig>  mde1502_t <dig>  mde33n3_t <dig> and hf15a13_t <dig>  six bess belonged to multi-gene families in either or both of the other dipteran genomes. putative orthologs could not be postulated when there was more than one gene family member in both the anopheles and drosophila genomes. however, in some cases, like bes hf3a11_t <dig>  the drosophila ortholog  belonged to a single gene-family while there were  <dig> genes in the family in anopheles. a putative ortholog was postulated as only one of these anopheles genes  was already determined by ensembl to be the ortholog of the drosophila gene. in addition, the hessian fly sequence had significantly high similarity  to only this anopheles gene. putative orthologs were also determined for bess hf10f11_t <dig>  hf4f24_sp <dig>  mde29l21_t <dig> and mde36j2_sp <dig> . mde36j2_t <dig> overlapped with the lrr family protein, mde8i18_ <dig> 

discussion
an in silico comparative genomic analysis was performed utilizing hessian fly genetic mapping, genomic sequence and est sequence data along with data available from public databases. we assembled a  <dig> kb region on the short arm of chromosome x <dig> and related physical distance to genetic distance. we sequenced, assembled and analyzed a  <dig>  kb bac clone  from the hessian fly . this sequence data was supplemented with  <dig> bess, contained within the contig and encompassing the mde8i <dig> bac clone, to perform a comparative genomic study. exon prediction combined with blastx and tblastn analyses revealed significant similarities to the a. gambiae and d. melanogaster genomes . mosquito and fly putative orthologs were determined for  <dig> of  <dig> sequences that demonstrated similarity . the higher similarity of the hessian fly sequences  to the anopheles putative orthologs indicated that the hessian fly is closer related to a. gambiae than d. melanogaster.

high-resolution physical mapping of dna by in situ hybridization  is a well established method of physical genome mapping that has been used with mammals, yeast, cloned fragments, and plants  <cit> . the ratio of genetic to physical distance , indicates an unusually high recombination rate  in this region. though the recombination rate is not constant across a particular genome, it averages at about  <dig>  cm/mb in both drosophila and humans  <cit> . recombination rates that are unusually high are seen in insects like the honeybee, which demonstrate genome wide recombination rates as high as  <dig> cm/mb  <cit> . to confirm the fiber-fish determined physical distances and hence the high recombination rate,  <dig> bac clones that were measured by fiber fish were also measured by chef gel electrophoresis. the total distance of  <dig> clones in the contig as measured by chef gel electrophoresis was  <dig> kb  whereas their total distance measured by f-fish was  <dig> kb. fiber-fish measurements were slightly greater  than estimates made by chef gel electrophoresis confirming the initially measured recombination rate. this higher recombination rate may be due to its telomeric location where recombination is usually higher  <cit>  or to the specific nature of this part of this genome.

the assembly of the hessian fly mde8i <dig> bac clone was accomplished using highly stringent parameters  <cit>  as this was the first genomic sequence assembly effort in this insect. the presence of a low frequency of randomly dispersed sequence mate-pairs with inconsistencies in either size or orientation was attributed to random error during library generation or assembly. these sequences were discarded, as their omission had no effect on the assembly. the stringent measures taken ensure the accuracy of this assembly and support all ensuing predictions and conclusions.

the g+c content of 32% observed here is comparable with  <dig> % seen in a. gambiae  <cit>  as well as that seen in d. melanogaster   <cit> . the  <dig> predicted transcripts in this region represent a gene density of  <dig> gene in ~ <dig>  kb indicating the presence of a higher number of genes in this region of the mayetiola genome than that of the dipterans, a. gambiae   and d. melanogaster   <cit>  in general. the observation that the hessian fly genome has a higher gene density, lower transposon content  and a small genome size . the strict criteria used here leads us to believe that we have minimized false positives. hessian fly sequences exhibited varying levels of similarity to both genome. mde8i18_ <dig> was virtually identical to its anopheles ortholog  . the extent of similarity to the anopheles sequence points to this protein having a conserved and important role in the two insects. at the lower limits of detection were the hf4f24_sp <dig> sequence and its similarity to the odorant binding proteins of anopheles  and drosophila . the relative low similarity seen here is likely due to pheromone binding proteins being highly individual and specific for different insect species. in addition the expansion of odorant protein families in various insects leads us to conclude that an orthologous relationship is tentative at best and can only be confirmed with an entire genome annotation. differing levels of similarity between orthologs amongst genomes would be due to varying evolutionary selective pressures on individual sequences in specific genomes.

based on amino acid and phylogenetic analyses , hessian fly sequences were found to demonstrate a higher similarity to anopheles sequences than to drosophila sequences. this supports the argument that the lineage that gave rise to the nematocera  diverged after the brachycera  split off the ancestral dipteran lineage  <cit> .

bess have been used to build detailed comparative physical maps with mammals  <cit> . a preliminary look at the sequences with high similarity demonstrate that there were spread across the drosophila and anopheles genomes . though 17%  of hessian fly bess demonstrated significant amino acid similarity to the a. gambiae and d. melanogaster genomes, realistic syntenic relationships cannot be inferred in the absence of an entire hessian fly genome. previous studies have looked at synteny seen between dipterans  <cit> , anophelines  <cit>  and drosophilids  <cit> . the lack of synteny as compared to that seen in mammalian studies  <cit>  suggests that even though insect genomes may contain highly similar transcripts, evolutionary divergence may correspond to recombination resulting in break fusion events and the resulting translocation of chromosomal arm segments followed by extensive paracentric inversions within the chromosome. the only genes that would retain linear order would be those that were either tightly linked or if their proximity was essential to their function.

CONCLUSIONS
this represents the most extensive analysis of the hessian fly genome to date, illustrating the importance of comparative genomic analyses to understand evolutionary and genetic relationships. it also provides us with an understanding of the architecture of this genome thereby serving as a platform for a whole genome sequencing effort. this study focused on a ~ <dig> mb genomic region on the x <dig> chromosome of the hessian fly. the relationship between physical and genetic distance revealed an unusually high recombination rate which may be due to its location at the telomeric end of the chromosome or may be a phenomenon specific to this particular region. hessian fly transcripts identified possessed significant similarity to those in the a. gambiae and d. melanogaster genomes. putative orthology was triangulated among all three genomes, inferring evolutionary relationships. the higher similarity seen between anopheles and mayetiola transcripts supports their closer evolutionary relationship and suggests that the higher dipteran split occurred prior to the divergence of the hessian fly and mosquito. the variable amount of similarity and seen between putative orthologs comments on evolutionary pressures exerted. the low transposon content as well as a structure not unlike sequenced genomes demonstrates that a wgs effort for this small genome is feasible. such an effort would enable further evolutionary and comparative sturdies and would allow the characterization of hessian fly genes such as vh <dig> thereby having a economic and agricultural implications.
