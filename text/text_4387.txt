BACKGROUND
many mechanisms for the alternative use of promoters, exons and polyadenylation signals within genes are known to significantly contribute to the complexity of the transcriptome  <cit> . these variations increase the number of products that can be generated from the currently recognized  <dig>  –  <dig>  protein-coding genes of the human genome  <cit> . for example, alternative promoters are used to confer specificity of mrna expression in time and space  <cit>  and of mrna translation  <cit> . often the n-terminal ends of proteins are altered to generate or remove signal sequences for protein localization  <cit> . central exons may or may not be present thus changing the peptide sequence and properties  <cit> . the alternative use of polya signals also has effects, for instance, on rna stability  <cit> .

the mechanisms described above all have in common the fact that the elements involved are associated only with the gene being transcribed and not with any other gene. the mechanism of trans-splicing, in which elements from more than one gene are involved in the generation of transcripts, is an open matter of discussion, although it appears to be rare and its function is still not well understood  <cit> . overlapping genes and transcripts have been described in many species and occur in several varieties  <cit> . however, in vertebrates, few transcripts have been described which join two genes with different reading frames  <cit> . we have found evidence for sequence overlap of transcripts from two protein coding genes, nup <dig> and il4i <dig>  where the latter is expressed in a tissue and cell-type specific manner. both genes are transcribed from the same promoter and share the first two exons. a similar process has been described for caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , in which mrnas of two cholinergic proteins are transcribed from one promoter. until now, this principle did not appear to be conserved in higher eukaryotes. the nup62/il4i <dig> genes are therefore the first proof that this mechanism is present in vertebrates. however, in contrast to what has been observed in c. elegans, the functions of the two proteins encoded by the one promoter are completely unrelated.

the protein encoded by nup <dig> belongs to the class of nucleoporins  and is an essential part of the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . its n terminus is believed to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, while the c-terminal end contains a coiled-coil structure aiding in protein-protein interactions, and may function in anchorage of the protein in the pore complex . nup <dig>  like the other nups, is conserved in the eukaryote kingdom  <cit> . the nup <dig> gene consists of a single promoter with a cpg island and three transcribed exons. the protein is encoded exclusively by the terminal exon; the first two exons are non-coding. the second exon is prone to alternative splicing and is not contained in about half of the reported cdnas derived from that gene . nup <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, an observation compatible with its essential role in transporting cargo across the nuclear envelope.

il4i <dig> was initially identified to be exclusively expressed in b lymphoblasts as a gene that was induced by treatment with interleukin  <dig>   <cit> . since then, the encoded protein has been identified as a leukocyte specific l-amino acid oxidase  that specifically oxidizes aromatic amino acids. the protein contains an n-terminal signal peptide, which targets the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and presumably to the lysosomes  <cit> , where it is believed to be involved in antigen processing in b cells  <cit>  and thus act in the immune response. the gene is reported to be transcribed from a single promoter, which appears to restrict expression to cells of the immune system, mostly in b lymphocytes  <cit> . it consists of eight exons, and the translation start is located in the second exon. the gene is conserved in eutherian mammals , but has not been identified in other eukaryotes and in prokaryotes.

we have identified several expressed sequence tags  that indicate expression of il4i <dig> in tissues other than b lymphocytes, namely human and mouse testis and brain. this expression of the il4i <dig> gene was apparently driven by the same promoter as the upstream nup <dig> gene. we have verified expression of the il4i1_ <dig> variant in mouse testis and brain, and thus show that the previously reported nup <dig> promoter also drives expression of a second gene in a cell-type and tissue specific manner. the mrna consists of sequence from both genes and two joining exons which are not part of either previously reported gene locus. our findings indicate a new mechanism of gene regulation in which two genes that encode unrelated proteins share the same promoter but yet are still expressed in radically different cellular patterns. this suggests that the nature of the transcripts and proteins encoded by these two genes is controlled by tissue specific regulation of pre-mrna processing.

RESULTS
the exon structure of variant il4i1_ <dig> joins the described nup <dig> and il4i <dig> genes
based on the available sequence information we predicted the gene structure for the human variant il4i1_ <dig> transcript represented by cdna image:  <dig> in fig.  <dig>  to validate this structure we obtained several mammalian gene collection clones that cover the splice variant and sequenced them to completion. one cdna  contained two mutations leading to premature in-frame stop codons. a second cdna  contained exon  <dig>  of the previously reported il4i <dig> gene  <cit> , also disrupting the open reading frame . the remaining clones  matched the predicted gene structure and thus supported the sequence of the variant. this gene structure includes the presumed first two exons of the nup <dig> gene which are both part of the 5' untranslated region . transcription of that variant is apparently controlled by the promoter that also controls expression of the nup <dig> mrna.

the terminal and coding exon from the nup <dig> gene is not contained in the il4i1_ <dig> variant . while the initiator atg of the reported il4i <dig> orf is located in exon  <dig>  the first two exons of the known il4i <dig> gene are absent in the variant. instead, the variant contains two additional exons  that are located in the region between the previously reported nup <dig> and il4i <dig> loci. the latter of the two exons contains the assumed translation initiator atg.

the il4i1_ <dig> variant is conserved in eutherian mammals
the splice variant is conserved in other eutherian mammals where order and orientation of the nup <dig> and il4i <dig> genes are syntenic. five ests from mouse verify the transcription and splicing of the il4i1_ <dig> variant. like the human ests, the mouse ests were derived from cdnas that had been generated from either testis or pooled tissues. one est was sequenced from rat testis. all these cdnas contain the first exon of the nup <dig> gene, two intergenic exons and then exon  <dig> of the il4i <dig> gene. there is apparently no homolog of human exon  <dig> of nup <dig> in mouse and rat. mouse nup <dig> is thus the equivalent of the human splice variant represented by cdna dkfzp547l <dig>  the location and sequences of the joining exons that are specific for the il4i1_ <dig> variant are conserved between mouse, dog and human. sequence conservation of the variant joining exons is higher than that of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of previously reported il4i <dig> . the probable translation initiation codon in exon  <dig>  lies within a consensus kozak sequence context . an upstream atg, which is in frame with the atg we propose to initiate translation, does not match the kozak consensus rules. it is present in human and chimpanzee, but not in mouse, rat or dog, and thus is not convincing; we suspect it could be prone to leaky scanning  <cit> . we conclude that translation either starts at the conserved atg, or that use of the upstream atg could possibly change some property of the encoded protein. while the n terminus of il4i1_ <dig> protein is predicted  to be a signal peptide  when starting at the kozak-atg, the extended n terminus is predicted to be a signal anchor  and not a signal peptide . an extension at the n terminus might thus change localization of the protein.

all transcripts analyzed had a short six  residue upstream orf, the localization and sequence of which was conserved. it remains to be determined whether this orf is expressed in vivo as has been shown for other genes  <cit> . this orf is too small and too close to the initiator atg of the il4i1-orf to suggest an internal ribosome entry site  – type mechanism  <cit> .

the il4i <dig> gene has thus far only been found in eutherian mammals. this is supported by analysis of the genes downstream of the nup <dig> orthologous genes in non-eutherian species. in fugu rubripes, the next gene downstream of nup <dig> is a homolog of human integrin alpha  <dig>  and the two genes are oriented tail to tail. in gallus gallus, the next gene downstream is the homolog of a human x-chromosomal gene  with unknown function, and the genes are oriented head to tail. in drosophila melanogaster, nup <dig> is followed by a hypothetical wd-repeat protein , which is in the opposite orientation  to nup <dig>  the situation in the opossum  is unclear, as the sequence scaffold that covers nup <dig> terminates  <dig> kb downstream and no gene is annotated there. however, the two genes that, according to annotation, flank opossum nup <dig> do not map to the chromosomal region that harbors human nup <dig> and il4i <dig>  in addition, no ortholog of the il4i <dig> gene has yet been identified in the opossum genome. thus, the evidence so far suggests that expression of variant il4i1_ <dig>  might be restricted to eutherian mammals. the sequencing and transcript analysis of more mammalian species will help to uncover the origin of the il4i <dig> gene and its variant.

mature ll4i <dig> protein and its variant are likely identical in sequence
since the translation start in the previously reported il4i <dig> transcript differs from that in the variant described here, the two protein products differ at their n termini. fig.  <dig> shows a sequence alignment of the n-terminal ends of il4i <dig> and the new variant. the n termini of il4i <dig> and those of the variant il4i1_ <dig> are conserved in the species analyzed. the il4i <dig> protein has been reported to be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and the endosomes with help of an n-terminal signal peptide  <cit> . signalp predicts such a signal peptide to be cleaved upstream of the glutamine residue at position  <dig> of the human variant protein. the homologous position is a leucine in the mouse protein and is there predicted to be the cleavage site. the same residue is the cleavage site also in the previously reported il4i <dig>  consequently the processed proteins are probably identical in sequence, and only differ in the length of the respective signal sequences. we next analyzed whether the n terminus of the il4i1_ <dig> variant may serve as signal peptide in vitro and expressed the protein in fusion with green fluorescent protein  in mammalian cell culture  <cit> . the variant protein was indeed translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit>  when overexpressed, and had the same localization as an overexpressed il4i1-gfp fusion protein .

the il4i1_ <dig> variant is specifically expressed in testis and brain
est evidence indicated that expression of the variant transcript might be tissue specific, as cdnas exclusively from testis and brain had been sequenced. we analyzed the expression of the variant transcript in northern blots of fetal and adult mouse . a probe specific for the variant il4i1_ <dig> was employed, comprising the two joining exons downstream of the nup <dig> coding exon. these exons are indicated with red triangles in fig.  <dig>  no expression of the il4i1_ <dig> variant was observed in fetal mice and in most adult tissues. a strong and specific band at  <dig>  kb was only observed in the testis. the variant il4i1_ <dig> transcript is predicted to be  <dig>  kb in size, not counting the polya tail, when sequence of the ests  is extended with the known il4i <dig> sequence towards its 3' end. the human variant il4i1_ <dig> is of similar size. expression in the brain was expected because of cdnas and ests available from that tissue, but not observed in northern blot analysis. a smaller rna of unknown sequence at  <dig>  kb was visible in the fetal mouse, and in adult mouse liver, kidney and testis.

having identified expression of the il4i1_ <dig> variant in a tissue other than b lymphocytes, we next carried out rna in situ hybridization to identify a possible cell-type specificity of this expression, and to find other tissues and cells where the variant is expressed. expression of variant il4i1_ <dig> was found in testis to be predominantly in sertoli cells at the periphery of the ducts . in contrast to the northern analysis, where brain did not have detectable expression of the il4i1_ <dig> variant, rna in situ hybridization revealed expression of the variant transcript in the adult mouse brain . purkinje cells , cells of the hippocampus, and mitral cells in the olfactory bulb were specifically stained with the il4i1_ <dig> specific antisense probe . even though expression in some cell types within the brain was strong, overall expression of variant il4i1_ <dig> in the brain was weak, matching the results obtained with pooled brain tissue in the northern analysis. no signals were detected in adult liver and kidney or in any of the embryonic stages by rna in situ hybridization .

discussion
we here report a novel transcript variant of the il4i <dig> gene, which is a product of two exons from the previously described nup <dig> gene, two apparently joining exons mapping between the reported nup <dig> and il4i <dig> gene loci, and six exons of the known il4i <dig> gene. expression of that variant is driven by the assumed nup <dig> gene promoter with high tissue and cell type specificity. the protein encoded by the variant il4i1_ <dig> transcript is essentially the same as that of the originally described il4i <dig> protein  <cit> , since the primary structures of the encoded proteins are identical after probable cleavage of the predicted signal peptides. although a different functionality of the variant signal peptides cannot be excluded  <cit> , the expression of this otherwise b-cell specific gene in testis and brain already adds significantly to the previously known properties of that gene and the encoded enzyme. the tissue specificity of the reported il4i <dig> promoter  <cit>  appears to be essential for survival, and expression of that gene appears to be tightly controlled. given the function of the encoded protein, a laao enzyme, such restriction of protein expression makes sense. limiting il4i <dig> expression to b cells would take reference to the specific function of that cell type . in contrast, the il4i <dig> protein is likely not involved in the immune system/antigen processing when expressed in testis or the brain. while the function of that protein in these tissues thus remains to be established, a possible involvement in disease should be analyzed. the lysyl oxidase  has been found at elevated levels in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  and in superoxide dismutase  knockout mice  and is believed to be involved in the progression of als  <cit> . the laao activity of il4i <dig> makes this protein a new candidate not only for als, but also for other diseases associated with the death of purkinje cells  <cit> . for example, the chromosomal location of the il4i <dig> gene at 19q <dig>  has been described as candidate region for spinocerebellar ataxia type sca <dig>  elevated expression levels of il4i <dig> have also been reported in primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma  <cit> , thus associating this gene with cancer as well. further experimentation will be necessary to establish a possible role of the variant il4i1_ <dig> in any of these or other diseases.

the previously described il4i <dig> promoter appears to be strictly specific for b-cell expression. it does not contain a cpg island and is reported to be induced for instance by stat <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the il4i1_ <dig> variant in the human is likely to be expressed exclusively in testis and brain. the nup <dig> gene has a cpg island and is ubiquitously expressed. in consequence, pre-mrnas are spliced to produce the novel variant only in testis and brain. however purkinje and sertoli cells also require functional nuclear pore complexes to survive. correct amounts of both mrnas need to be generated within the cells. the amounts could be regulated most likely at the splicing and/or polyadenylation levels, or by specific mrna degradation. in consequence, the variant il4i1_ <dig> transcript is indicative of a so far undetected mechanism of gene regulation. while the presence of alternative promoters is a common theme in many genes, the cell-type specific expression of two genes from one promoter is novel, especially when the transcripts contain exons from both genes.

thus far, gene fusions had mostly been associated with disease  <cit> ; for example, trans-splicing is associated with viral infection  <cit> . however, the process reported here occurs in normal individuals and could be essential in the expressing cell types. apparent joining of genes as indicated by cdna sequences takes place at a rather high rate, but in many cases these cdnas are likely to have been the result of errors in the pre-mrna processing machinery  <cit> . one example is ak <dig>  which points to a fusion between il4i <dig> and the downstream gene encoding tbc <dig> domain family member  <dig>  however, these genes are oriented tail to tail, and the sequence structure of ak <dig> is not supported by any further cdna data. ak <dig> even extends into the next further downstream gene akt1s <dig>  the "splice variant" represented by this cdna therefore most likely originated from the lack of transcriptional termination and mis-splicing of cryptic "exons". this cdna could thus be regarded as biological noise  <cit> . while being probably not of functional relevance, this and many other similar cdna sequences  raise questions as to the fidelity of rna production and processing in cells, and as to the requirement of biological systems to be able to tolerate such events. since errors at the rna level are not inherited per se, the observed phenomena presumably are indicative of the flexibility and stability of the cellular system, rather than that these rnas themselves would contribute to the evolutionary principle directly. our findings now suggest that promiscuity of the pre-mrna processing machinery is a required mechanism on a higher than previously reported  <cit> , i.e., a trans-gene level, and that it is regulated at tissue and cell-type levels.

several questions remain unanswered. why and how is the pre-mrna spliced to specifically produce the variant il4i1_ <dig> mrna? is transcription of rna polymerase past the 3'-terminal exon of nup <dig>  which is required to join exons from the apparent nup <dig> and il4i <dig> genes, restricted to the cell types and tissues where the variant is detected, or is the tissue specificity of that variant mrna determined in the splicing/polyadenylation process? why is il4i <dig> expression driven by the nup <dig> promoter at all? more globally, is this a unique mechanism or are there more genes that are driven by the promoters of upstream genes? are there other cases where an apparently leaky splicing mechanism could be favourable over the risk of erroneous transcription from a more promiscuous promoter? and finally, how did this mechanism evolve? the evolution of this mechanism would have required at least three events to happen, probably in early eutherian development: 1) the installation of neighborhood and orientation of these two genes, 2) the continuation of transcription beyond the nup <dig> translated exon and its transcription termination signals, and 3) the development of tissue specificity for nup <dig> and il4i1_ <dig> pre-mrna processing. selective pressure appears to have favoured preservation of the status quo. sequence conservation of those exons that are specific for the variant is even higher than that of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the previously reported il4i <dig> transcript. this could hint to an essential function of the variant and to the possibility that it was not il4i <dig> that integrated downstream of nup <dig>  but that instead nup <dig> integrated into the il4i <dig> gene. the latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that the complete nup <dig> orf is located on one exon in mammals, while it is split into several exons in other eukaryotes. thus the so-called nup <dig> promoter might actually be an ancient il4i <dig> promoter that triggered expression of two independent orfs after integration of a nup <dig> retroposon. an immediate question would follow: what happened to the original nup <dig> gene in eutherians? the cdna flj <dig>  which maps to human chromosome xq <dig>  encodes a protein that is homologous to part of nup <dig>  namely the most conserved nucleoporin nsp1-like c-terminal domain . that domain is fundamental for interaction with nup <dig>  another protein of the nuclear pore complex. the exon/intron structure of at least three exons in the flj <dig> locus is the same as in the chicken nup <dig> gene . the conservation of flj <dig> and nup <dig> extends into the 3'utr of flj <dig>  which is however part of the coding region of nup <dig> . in human, dog, mouse and opossum, the flj <dig> gene is flanked by cxorf  <dig>  and flj <dig>  and their orthologs, respectively. the same homologous genes flank the nup <dig> gene in chicken in identical order and orientation. flj <dig> in human xq <dig>  might consequently be a remnant of the ancient nup <dig> in mammals, having lost a number of exons and much of its coding region. other examples of retrogenes have been reported  <cit> . in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of nup <dig>  est data from mouse and human suggest that expression of flj <dig> is mostly in early development. these findings indicate this probable ancient form of mammalian nup <dig> may still be expressed but is likely to have acquired a novel function. presence of the nsp1_c like region, however, could implicate this protein to be involved in the nuclear pore complex as well.

the mechanism that determines the processing of nup62/il4i1_ <dig> pre-mrnas into its final form also remains to be identified. an attractive model would be the frequently observed use of alternative polyadenylation sites that is coupled to alternative splicing  <cit> . then the terminal exon of nup <dig> could be interpreted as "merely" an alternative 3'-end of the il4i <dig> gene, or the downstream exons of il4i <dig> were alternative ends of the nup <dig> gene. a possible nup <dig> retroposon would have contained a polyadenylation signal and a polya-tail. consensus polyadenylation signals  are present in the nup <dig> gene and transcripts while the polya tail appears to have vanished since the time of integration. the downstream sequence element needed to make the polyadenylation signal functional  <cit>  and to terminate transcription must have been present within the intron of the il4i <dig> gene into which the retroposon inserted.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and verified a novel mechanism for regulation of gene expression that involves the transcription of two genes from the same promoter and the processing of two variant mrnas from probably the same pre-mrna. the encoded proteins are completely unrelated. conservation of this mechanism in eutherians suggests both transcripts and the encoded proteins are essential for survival. finally, our finding puts the current definition of the term "gene" in question, as the variants we have identified and analyzed are clearly the product of two genes. in addition to one promoter driving the expression of these genes, two of the formerly named nup <dig> exons are also part of the il4i1_ <dig> variant. should these exons be counted as belonging to the nup <dig> or to the il4i <dig> genes? one current definition of a gene is "a complete chromosomal segment responsible making a functional product"  <cit> . the chromosomal segment encoding the b-cell variant of il4i <dig> appears completely separate from that of nup <dig> and thus fulfils all criteria of the above definition. this is not true however for the newly detected il4i1_ <dig> variant. nup <dig> and il4i1_ <dig> share noncoding regulatory dna sequences, exons and introns within one chromosomal segment. the functional sequences of nup <dig> and il4i1_ <dig>  however, are unique and distinct, which is another criterion used to separate two genes. in consequence, the above definition of a "gene" should be put in question. nature may have more surprises to reveal, and with increasing amounts of data on genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes being collected and analyzed, other paradigms may require revision.
