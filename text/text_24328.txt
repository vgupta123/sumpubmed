BACKGROUND
according to a recent world health organization report, breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer. each year there are about  <dig> new cases of breast cancer in men and  <dig>  new cases in women in the u.s.  <cit> . while age and gender are two primary demographic risk factors in breast cancer, about 5–10 % of breast cancer risk is attributed to hereditary gene mutations in brca <dig>  brca <dig> and tp <dig>  <cit> . breast cancer is a complex disease. its heterogeneous nature has been classified by its molecular characteristics. the protein expression status of estrogen receptor alpha , progesterone receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor- <dig>  decide the group of breast cancers. it can be subtyped as luminal a , luminal b , her2amp  and basal-like/triple negative   <cit> . the basal-like patients are correlated with biologically aggressive disease and often have a poor prognosis  <cit> . in luminal a and luminal b subtypes, er was identified as the therapeutic target, and its targeted hormone therapies  have been well established. in her <dig> amplification group, trasuszumab is the candidate drug. however, basal-like triple negative tumors still do not have recognizable therapies. the target identification and its subtype classification is an important aspect for therapy development in breast cancer  <cit> .

cell lines, originated from human tumors, have historically acted as the primary experimental model to investigate the cancer biology and molecular pharmacology. parallel massive drug screening on these cancer cells characterize the diverse cancer cell reactions to drugs by genomic features. as a salient example, the cancer cell line encyclopedia  project conducts a detailed genetic characterization of a large panel of  <dig> human cancer cell lines in dna copy number, mrna expression and mutation  <cit> . together with the drug screening data, ccle becomes a powerful resource for the drug and target discovery researches.

breast cancer is heterogeneous in nature. cell lines study is only an interpretation from a context of artifacts introduced by selection and establishment in vitro, and there exists large differences between cancer cell lines and tissue samples especially in its molecular genome  <cit> . selecting the right cells model to mimic tumor tissues helps to evaluate proper drug reactions in tumors in vitro  <cit> . gene-expression profiling has become an important tool to characterize both the similarity and dissimilarity between cell lines and tumors. a recent work by ross dt  <cit>  demonstrated the distinctive gene expression signature in breast cancer tissue: basal, luminal epithelial cell signature, as well as mesenchymal/stromal. lacroix m  <cit>  valuated some widely used breast cancer cell lines as breast tumor models by a comparative genetic expression features. besides gene expression, cnv has gradually been recognized as important due to features in predicting cancer progression and recurrence. jessica kao et al.  <cit>  compared the gene expression profiles and cnvs of breast cancer cells and tumor tissues to define relevant cell line models. both fridlyand et al.  <cit>  and richard m. et al.  <cit>  conducted similar analyses, in which the similarity was further investigated within the breast cancer subtypes. nevertheless, these researches provide important information for understanding a molecular mechanism from only one aspect of the breast cancer genome, such as mrna or dna or protein, but not both. no one has yet attempted to investigate the correlation between cell lines and tumor tissues from all cnv, mutation, gene expression and protein expression between and within breast cancer subtypes systematically.

the cancer genome atlas   <cit>  aims to discover major cancer-causing genomic alterations. it publicly provides  <dig> breast tumor samples with mrna expression profiling, dna exome parallel sequencing, cnv, and protein expression. because of this valuable data, a number of important breast cancer genes and pathways were detected systematically during the past 3 years . however, systematic comparisons between tcga breast tumor samples and breast cell line data, such as cancer cell line encyclopedia , have not yet been conducted. the primary innovation of this comparison is that, for the first time, four layers of genomic data: cnv, mutation, mrna expression and protein expression, were investigated to seek the similarity or dissimilarity between breast cancer cells and tumors. secondly, because of better sensitivity and broader dynamic range of sequencing technology comparing to the array platforms, genomic data was better captured in tcga and ccle by the platform data comparison. in this paper, a comprehensive comparison in cnv, mutation, mrna expression and protein expression between ccle breast cancer cell lines and tcga primary breast tumors is presented separately. at the end, a total score that integrates four genomic features will be defined to investigate the overall similarity between breast cancer cell lines and its tumor tissues.

RESULTS
sixty-eight breast cancer cell lines were extracted from ccle  <cit>  and literature  <cit> . one thousand seven hundred five breast cancer tumor samples were obtained from tcga and gene expression omnibus . all of the datasets are listed in table  <dig>  different subsets of samples were assayed on four different level platforms, including affymetrix hu <dig> and agilent g4502a_07_ <dig> for mrna expression microarrays irrespectively, affymetrix  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays for copy number variation, whole-exome sequencing in tcga and hybrid capture sequencing  <dig> genes in ccle for mutation analysis. reverse-phase protein lysate microarrays  are used to test basal phosphorylation and protein abundance in tcga tumors and cell lines. please note that not all samples were characterized on each platform. different subsets of tumors and cell lines were analyzed in each platform . each one of the four platform data analyses focused on the overlapping genes between tumors and cell lines, and the overall similarity analysis by using all four platforms was conducted afterward. figure  <dig> describes the overall analysis process between cell lines and tumors in breast cancer.table  <dig> four molecular profiles datasets for tumor and cell lines comparison in breast cancer

gene expression profiles comparison between breast cancer cell lines and tumors
pam <dig>   <cit>  is one of the most common genetic tests for breast cancer subtyping. the pam <dig> was designed as a rt-qpcr 50-gene expression signature. it has been acknowledged as a prognostic gene signature assay by an authoritative organization, national comprehensive cancer network  , in year  <dig>  due to this, many breast tumor and cell line samples lacked of er, pr, and her <dig> status for breast cancer treatment classifications. as for the missing information of her <dig> status, it has  <dig> in  <dig> tcga tumors and  <dig> in  <dig> ccle cell lines. these samples are classified as subtypes of luminal a, luminal b, her2amp, and basal-like using the pam <dig> signature. on the other hand, the rt-qpcr and mrna-based pam <dig> er/pr/her <dig> classification results are compared. figure  <dig> displays the pam <dig> gene expression signature predicted subtypes of cell lines and tumors in breast cancer, and the observed er, pr, her <dig> status. eight hundred seventy five tcga samples have information of er/pr/her <dig> status in  <dig> tumors, while  <dig> cell lines in  <dig> ccle samples have those. figure 2a shows the pam <dig> subtypes of  <dig> invasive breast cancer patients in tcga using agilentg4502a_07_ <dig> array platform. comparing to the standard er, pr, and her <dig> status for classification of breast carcinoma by using immunohistochemistry staining ,  <dig> tumors with pam <dig> classification are in concordance with the standard classification in  <dig> tumors, where the normal-like patients  are excluded. the concordance rate is  <dig>  %. figure 2b shows the breast cancer subtype classification of  <dig> breast cancer cell lines in ccle using  <dig> genes pam analysis. gene expression profile in ccle was conducted in affymetrix hu <dig> plus <dig>  array platform. thirty-four cell lines with known classification are in concordance with pam <dig> classification, and the concordance rate is  <dig>  % . some cell lines without er/pr/her <dig> status, such as kpl <dig>  zr <dig>  hs742t, hs60t, hs281t, hs343t, hs <dig>  received er/pr/her <dig> imputation from the pam <dig> prediction. in the follow-up data analysis, we kept the known classification and imputed pam <dig> for both cell lines and tumor samples. additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig> list the classification results for cell lines and tumors based on pam <dig> gene expression. interestingly, we observed that the gene expression pattern of pam <dig> between cell lines and tumors are similarity, but some genes in cell lines are not as highly expressed as in tumors, such as gene foxa <dig> and esr <dig> fig.  <dig> gene expression pam50-breast cancer subtype classifications of cell lines and primary tumors for er, pr, her <dig> status. a the pam <dig> subtype classification of  <dig> invasive breast cancer samples in tcga, which uses agilentg4502a_07_ <dig> array platform. b the pam <dig> subtype classification of  <dig> breast cancer cell lines, which uses affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  array platform



in order to compare the similarity of the whole genome expression profiles between primary breast cancer tumors and breast cancer cells , the breast cancer tumors in gene expression omnibus  gse <dig>  were selected because they shared the same affymetrics gene expression platform . figure  <dig> shows the correlation distributions of whole genome expression between breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. the  <dig> box plots of the correlations illustrate the similarity between  <dig> cell lines and  <dig> tumors. the correlation coefficient is around  <dig> – <dig>  between cell lines and tumors. these results show that cell lines keep a high similarity to tumors in whole gene expression profile in breast cancer even though in different subtypes.fig.  <dig> whole genome expression correlation analysis between  <dig> breast cancer cell lines and  <dig> primary tumors. the x-axis indicates  <dig> cell lines, and y-axis is the correlation coefficient between tumors and cells. the cell line subtypes are denoted in different colors



copy number variations comparison between ccle breast cancer cell lines and tcga breast cancer tumors
cnvs are compared between ccle breast cancer cell lines and tcga breast cancer primary tumors in various breast cancer subtypes. figure  <dig> displays copy number distribution for both tumors and cell lines across  <dig> chromosomes. in fig. 4a, chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> have the highest copy number amplification frequencies while chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have the most copy number deletion regions in both cell lines and tumor tissues. figure 4b displays the significant genomic alterations in breast cancer tumors and cell lines. myc, pvt <dig>  rad <dig> and trps <dig> are top four copy number amplified genes, while map2k <dig>  ankrd <dig>  aprt, csmd <dig> and zfpm <dig> are top five genes with copy number deletions. some important cancer genes, such as pik3ca, brca <dig>  brca <dig>  and erbb <dig>  show a mixture of amplifications and deletions.fig.  <dig> the cnv comparison between  <dig> tcga breast cancer samples and  <dig> ccle breast cancer cell lines. a dna copy number profiles across the whole chromosomes  and copy number amplification and deletion in highly mutated breast cancer driver genes. the red color indicates amplification, while the blue color indicates deletion. the top panel is tcga, and the bottom panel is ccle. b is the cnv frequency comparison for highly mutated genes between tcga breast cancer samples and ccle breast cancer cell lines



the cnvs between cell lines and tumor samples of breast cancer are compared in sample segmentation mean and density calculation of copy number fraction genome altered . its calculation is presented in the method section. figure 5a demonstrates that cell lines have more copy number deletions than tumors. in particular, hcc <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  and uacc <dig> are the top  <dig> cnv deletions cell lines. in fig. 5b, it is evident that the frequency of copy number alteration are significantly higher in cell lines than in tumors. the mean cell line fga is wider than that of tumor fga. in order to evaluate the similarity between tumors and cell lines, the pearson correlations for the top 10 % cnv in  <dig> genes are calculated between  <dig> cell lines and  <dig> tumors. fig. 5c shows the cnv-based correlation coefficient distribution between cell lines and tumors in different breast cancer subtypes. we observe that cell lines hcc <dig>  mda-mb-175-vii, zr-75- <dig>  bt- <dig>  hcc <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> are more similar to tumors in cnv than the other cancer cells. their correlation coefficients are larger than  <dig>  . on the other hand, hmel, hs 578 t, hs  <dig> t, hs  <dig> t, hs  <dig> t, hs  <dig> t, cal- <dig>  hs  <dig> t and hs  <dig> t had negative correlation coefficients with tumors samples .fig.  <dig> cnv similarity analysis between cell line and tumors in breast cancer. a is the average segmentation length comparison between cell lines and tumors samples, here the segmentation length is measured according to log

mutation analysis in cell lines and tumors
ccle sequenced only  <dig> cancer genes in breast cancer, while tcga has whole exome sequencing. our comparative analysis is only based on those  <dig> overlapping genes and their somatic mutations. in ccle, in order to remove background germline mutation, mutations reported in the  <dig> genome project and dbsnp were filtered out using annovar tool, including the gene-based single nucleotide variants  and insertions/deletions  <cit> .

figure  <dig> shows the comparisons of somatic mutations between cell lines and tumors across four aspects: somatic mutation frequency, somatic mutation density, average mutation sites distribution per million bases  in four subtypes, as well as mutation correlation variation between cell lines and tumors. figure 6a illustrates the mutation frequency per mb in tcga and ccle vs cnv fraction genome alteration. a subset of cell lines with hyper-mutated genes is revealed, such as mdamb <dig>  bt <dig>  mdamb <dig> and hcc <dig>  these cells of breast cancer show moderately higher mutation frequency than the tumors. figure 6b shows the somatic mutation density. the median somatic mutational frequency for tumors in tcga is around  <dig>  while cell lines in ccle is around  <dig>  figure 6c shows the somatic mutation distribution among four subtypes of breast cancer in tcga and ccle, where y-axis is the mutation rate per million bases and x-axis is mutation gene numbers. the wider the line is, the more the gene mutation number of samples is. it suggests that the gene mutation number in luminal b subtype from tcga is the largest. at the same time, its mutation rate is also higher than the other subtypes. tumor and cell lines with luminal a subtype have the lowest mutation numbers and mutation rate. her <dig> subtype group in cell lines has a larger mutation number than the other subtypes. figure 6d shows the  <dig> somatic mutation genes-based correlation coefficient distributions between cell lines and tumors in different breast cancer subtypes. these genes were firstly denoted as  <dig> or  <dig> to illustrate non-mutation or mutation. the correlation is distributed in the range of ; additional file 2: table s <dig> shows the detail correlation coefficient between cell lines and tumors in four levels for gene expression, mutation, copy number variation and protein irrespectively. the top four cell lines that have the highest mutational correlation with tumors are: uacc <dig>  jimt <dig>  efm <dig> and hcc <dig>  the highest consistency coefficient is  <dig> .fig.  <dig> dna sequencing-based mutation comparison between ccle  <dig> cell lines and tcga  <dig> tumors. a the scatter plot of fraction genome altered and mutation per million bases for tcga samples and ccle samples; b the mutation densities in breast tumors and cell lines; c mutation-based subtypes similarity of cell line and tumors in breast cancer; d mutation correlation coefficient distributions between cell lines and tumors



thirty-one genes, reported in recent tcga nature and science papers , were selected as important driver mutation genes in the breast cancer. these genes were further investigated across  <dig> breast cancer cell lines. figure  <dig> shows a landscape of these functional driver mutations in these cell lines of breast cancer. according to the mutation per megabyte base calculation, hcc <dig>  mdamb <dig>  and bt <dig> are hyper-mutated cell lines, while hs 281 t, hs 343 t, and zr  <dig> are lowly mutated cell lines. the popular cell lines mcf <dig> and mdamb <dig> have median mutation rates. the top mutated genes in breast cancer tumors are tp <dig>  and pik3ca . tp <dig> has copy number deletion in almost all cell lines, and has mixed somatic mutation. cnv has a dominant role in pik3ca across  <dig> cell lines with mixed somatic mutations. genome integrity pathway genes, atm, bap <dig>  brca <dig>  ttn and tp <dig>  almost all have strong gene copy number amplification in cell lines mixed with somatic mutation, except for ttn. similar data has been observed in genes map2k <dig> and map3k <dig> on mapk signaling pathway. genes prkca, ptgs <dig> and znf <dig> have many copy number deletions. the important drug biomarkers braf and erbb <dig>  are relatively conservative, which do not have much somatic mutations.fig.  <dig> the landscape of functional driver mutations in cell lines of breast cancer. upper rows show the gene mutation frequency and mutation rate per million bases  in  <dig> tumors. left column shows the popularity of breast cancer cell lines denoted by the publication citation number in pubmed and mutated rate per mb in cell lines. point mutations  and copy number variation  are shaped into the horizontal bar and vertical bar with different color, respectively



a comparison of mutation spectra across four subtypes  reveals that the mutation transition rates of cell lines and tumors are similar within different subtypes. on the other hand, it can be observed that breast cancer contains larger c > t and c > g trans-versions in subtypes her2amp and luminal b. her2amp has the highest c > t trans-version rate. luminal a has the highest a > c trans-version. figure 8b shows the correlation of six mutation categories in tumors and cell lines. it suggests that c > t and c > g trans-version possess the highest concordance between tumors and cell lines. basal-like subtypes between cells and tumor tissue are consistent in a > t and c > g transition, while only a > g trans-version showed the correlation between tumors and cell lines in subtypes of luminal b.fig.  <dig> mutation spectra and contexts across  <dig> subtypes of breast cancer. a mutation spectrum of six transition  and transversion  categories for each subtypes of breast cancer . b hierarchically clustered mutation context  for six mutation categories. colour denotes degree of correlation: red , yellow , green , blue 



comparison analysis of proteins phosphorylation expression between cell lines and tumors in breast cancer
quantitative expression of  <dig> cancer-related proteins, phosphorylated-proteins by rppa, were measured on  <dig> breast tumors and  <dig> cell lines. pearson correlation analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses were conducted between cell lines and tumors . the correlations in fig. 9a suggest that all four cell line subtypes possess different correlation distributions with tumor samples. luminal b cells have the highest correlations, while basal cells have the lowest correlations and also show the largest variations. figure 9d illustrated hierarchy distance among cell lines. it suggests that the same subtype cell lines usually are closely clustered. protein expressions for er and pr have high concordance, and they are reversely correlated with coveolin. <dig> in all subtypes, especially in the basal-like subtype. a similar variation phenomena was observed in several other groups’ of proteins in different subtypes: , , , and . correlations between cell lines and tumors are further illustrated in fig. 9c. the correlation ranges from − <dig>  to  <dig> . some cell lines, t47d, bt <dig>  and au <dig>  are the top three cell lines that have closer correlations to tumors in protein level, while the most popular breast cancer cell line, mcf <dig>  is somewhere in the middle. the exact correlations between cell lines and tumors are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> based on  <dig> phosphor-proteins.fig.  <dig> protein-based comparison of cell lines and tumors in breast cancer according to  <dig> proteins in rppa testing. a rppa-based pearson correlation distribution in different subtypes of cell lines in breast cancer. b rppa-based cell lines correlation in breast cancer by pearson correlation. the dot size expresses the correlation strong or weak, and the larger means it has a strong correlation. the color bar shows the positive or negative directions. c rppa-based correlation distribution between cell lines and tumors in breast cancer by  <dig> phosphorylated proteins. a dot means a correlation coefficient between a cell and a tumor. the different colors represent the different breast cancer subtypes. the same subtype of tumors and cells are used to calculate their correlation coefficient. d rppa-based cell lines hierarchy clusters in breast cancer. rows are proteins while columns are cell line samples



figure  <dig> shows the hierarchical distance between cell lines and tumors based on the  <dig> phosphorylated-proteins. the cell lines and tumors are assembled together by these proteins. it clearly classifies these breast cancer samples into four distinctive subtypes. interestingly, the basal-like cell lines mdamb <dig>  sum139pt and hcc <dig> are similar to protein features of luminal a subtypes in tumors. another discovery is that the basal-like cell line mdamb <dig> is close to luminal b tumors. all details of the result is referred to in additional file 2: table s <dig>  protein rppa correlation coefficient between cell lines and tumors.fig.  <dig>  <dig> protein rppa-based hierarchical clustering between  <dig> tumors and  <dig> cell lines. rows are different proteins and columns are tumors and cell lines samples. two color bars represent subtypes of breast cancer and data types irrespectively



correlation analysis of gene expression verse phosphorylated protein expression between cell lines and tumors in breast cancer
the correlations of the gene mrna versus its phosphorylated protein was calculated in cell lines and tumors irrespectively. the average correlation coefficient  of  <dig> genes’ mrna with their  <dig> phosphorylated proteins concentration ranges from − <dig>  to  <dig>  both in cell lines and tumors. nearly 60% of the genes had a positive correlation between mrna and protein. esr <dig> has the highest correlation coefficient r− <dig>  in  <dig> tcga tumors, and r =  <dig>  in  <dig> ccle cell lines of breast cancer between mrna and protein. drug-target genes, such as pgr, her <dig>  egfr and ar, all have high correlation  between mrna and protein both in tcga tumors and cell lines. two important oncogenes, gata <dig> and rp56kb <dig>  both have high mrna- protein correlation. the correlation for gata <dig> is  <dig>  in cell lines and  <dig>  in tumors, while the correlation for rp56kb <dig> is  <dig>  in cell lines and  <dig>  in tumors. the small figure in fig. 11a shows the linear correlation of the gene-protein between cell lines and tumors, which the linear correlation coefficient is  <dig>  . this strong signal indicates the consistency of gene expression and protein expression in both cell line and tumor. the potential discrepancy could be due to the stability of mrna, the degradation of protein, the time dependent and site dependent nature of protein phosphorylation, and etc. the interesting result in the fig. 11b illustrates the gene expression amount are irrelevant to the correlation of mrna-protein. as a matter of fact, the highest expressed gene rp <dig> has a negative correlation with mrna-protein correlations in both cell lines and tumors.fig.  <dig> the comparison between  <dig> genes mrna expression and their phosphorylated proteins expression in tumors and cell lines. a the correlation comparison of mrna verse phosphorylated protein in cell lines and tumors. b the  <dig> gene expression average in  <dig> cell lines



what kinds of cell lines are close to tumors?
gene expression profiles and proteins phosphorylation expressions of tumors and cell lines were compared to further corroborate our observations made on the cnv and mutation data. the correlations of four different molecular profiles of all cell line and tumor pairs were calculated . these four correlations differ greatly from each other. gene expression-based correlation had the largest correlation, cnv correlation was the next highest, mutation and protein expression correlations were low. these four correlations were combined into a total score as formula . figure 12b shows the ranked cell lines by their average total correlations with the tumors. bt <dig>  t47d, mdamb <dig> are the true top  <dig> cell lines in breast cancer research.fig.  <dig> the cell lines correlation degree with tumors in  <dig> molecular levels to breast cancer. a the correlations in  <dig> different molecular datasets. . b whole score between cell lines and tumors according to  <dig> different molecular dataset’s correlation



discussion
breast cancer is a highly complex disease. the subsets of breast tumors show diverse patterns of gene expression, cnv, mutation, and protein expression. a considerable amount of knowledge on breast carcinomas have been derived from in vivo and in vitro studies performed on breast cancer cell lines. whether breast cancer cells are representative of the tumors remains debatable. in this study, the comparisons between cell lines and primary tumors from molecular profiles: gene expression, cnv, mutation, and protein expression, show that the cell lines are similar to some but not all of the primary tumors. among them, gene expressions have the highest while the mutation-based correlation was the lowest.in gene expression-based clustering analysis, cell lines possess similar clustering as with tumors using pam <dig>  at the same time, cell lines show stable genomic and expression patterns, as well as high correlation, with tumors in whole gene expression profile.

from the mutation comparison between cell lines and tumors, some common features were found: the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> regions show high frequency copy number amplification, and chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> display high frequency deletions. some significant cancer-related genomic alterations: myc, pvt <dig>  rad <dig>  trps <dig>  cdh <dig>  rb <dig>  pik3ca, map2k <dig>  and ankrd <dig>  are identified in both breast cancer tumors and cell lines. the results were verified partially in reference  <cit> .



in the single point mutation comparison, the six trans-version distribution modes of mutation spectrum demonstrates the similarity between tumors and cell lines in four breast cancer subtypes. high frequent c > t and c > g transitions are observed in both tumors and cell lines, while few a > t happens; basal-like tumors and cells show the high concordance. these results were confirmed by philip j. et al.  <cit> . they suggested that the underlying mutation mechanism is related to transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair . ner removes bulky dna adducts that distort the dna double helix and introduces a strand bias for mutation. however, little is known about the trans-version processes of mutation.

in analyzing the cancer landmark genes, gene pik3ca and tp <dig> in cell lines are the top  <dig> mutated genes that tumors have  <cit> . in addition, luminal a subtype in cell lines possess hyper mutations in three genes gata <dig>  pik3ca, and map3ki. her <dig> subtype cell lines have 72 % and 39 % mutation rates for tp <dig> and pik3ca, respectively. in the recent report  <cit> , similar results in tumors were reported, in which luminal a is dominated with a high pik3ca mutation frequency and luminal b had high pik3ca and tp <dig> mutation frequency. her <dig> cell lines have a high pik3ca and tp <dig> mutations frequency in company with her <dig> amplification  <cit> . in addition, important drug biomarkers, such as braf, erbb <dig> , kras, have very low somatic mutation. all these evidences suggest that the cancer cell lines have very similar cnvs and gene mutations patterns as tumors.

on the other hand, cell lines have more genetic aberrations than primary tumors. amplification, deletion and mutation are more frequent in the cell lines than in the tumors. this is consistent with a similar study in ovarian cancer  <cit> . one potential interpretation is that cell lines may have transformed numerous passages over the period of cell culture time or get contaminated with stromal cells  <cit> . another interpretation could be that the cell line is derived predominantly from early-stage tumors or pleural effusions  <cit> .c) in protein expression-based comparison, breast cancer subtype proteins er, pr and her <dig> have a high consistence in cell lines and in tumors. rppa can identify breast cancer subtypes clearly and accurately not only in cell lines but also in tumors according to these protein statuses. rppa is a sensitive and accurate technology to evaluate protein expression and activities. it helps the target identification, validation, and drug discovery  <cit> . some cell lines, t47d, bt <dig>  and au <dig>  have much closer protein expression than the popular mcf <dig> cell does. on the other hand, protein expression correlation between cell lines and tumors in breast cancer vary greatly ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig> , it is also true in the same subtype cell lines and the variation is particularly high investigated in the basal-like subtype. the results were supported by sorger et al.  <cit> , who investigated the immediate-early signaling that regulates the akt  and erk  pathways in different breast cancer cell types. they found that cell lines have diverse to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. in addition, they found that the basal-like cells have the largest variations in responding to growth factors while her2amp cell lines have the least variations  <cit> . basal-like breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous group without proper drug targets yet. brian d. et al. investigated the subtypes for basal-like breast cancer and preclinical models for targeted therapy selection  <cit> . according to brca <dig>  ar, pik3ca and pten mutations, drugs are selected in cell lines to predict preclinical tnbc targeted therapies.

d) there are many complicated post-transcriptional mechanisms in turning mrnas into proteins. according to correlation analyses between gene expression and phosphorylated protein expression in both cell lines and tumors, significant results are found that important drug targets in breast cancer, such as esr <dig>  pgr, her <dig>  egfr and ar show high correlated mrna and protein levels. high mrna-protein correlation. two oncogenes gata <dig> and rp56kb <dig> with high consistency correlation between mrna and protein expression become a promising potential drug targets. on the other hand, the gene expression variation at the mrna level is not necessarily consistent with its protein level, such as genes tp <dig>  kdr, decam <dig>  which has been well documented in the literature  <cit> . most interestingly, the mrna-protein correlation patterns comparing cell lines with primary tumors show a great deal of consistency among  <dig> investigated genes. however, the gene expression amount is irrelevant to the translation processing from mrna to protein directly.

e) in the whole score overall comparison, cell lines and tumors show high gene expression-based correlations, but the correlations in mutation and protein expression level are low. the possible reason is that mutation data is discrete, and mutation rate is low.



according to pubmed search builder  in year  <dig>  the number of citations for all breast cancer cell lines at ccle is sorted . the most commonly studied cell lines are mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig> and sk-br- <dig>  they each have more than  <dig> pubmed citations. however, the correlation between these cell lines and tumors lies in the middle according to a total score of four molecular profile analyses. on the other hand, less popular cell lines, such as bt <dig>  t47d, mdamb <dig>  are in the top  <dig> for representing breast tumors.f) breast cancer subtypes in tumors and cell lines. the breast cancer cell line classification provides a cell modeling system to primary tumors. our study addresses the classification results for cell lines and tumors based on pam <dig> . although some classification results are not consistent with the known classification in cell lines and tumors, the whole subtype’s concordance reaches more than 60 %. any cell line’s usage as a tumor’s model depends upon its subtype’s speculation. a hypothesis based on gene expression will lead to different cell selection versus another hypothesis based on mutation.



CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, a comprehensive comparison in cnv, mutation, mrna expression and protein expression between ccle breast cancer cell lines and tcga primary breast tumors is conducted and presented. the following are our primary conclusion.  pam <dig> gene expression differentiated four major breast cancer subtypes, such as luminal a and b, her2amp, and basal-like, in both cells and tumors. using whole genome expression arrays, strong correlations are observed between cells and tumors.  consistent cnv patterns are observed between tumors and cells across the chromosome. high c > t and c > g trans-version rates are observed in both cell lines and tumors, while cells have slightly higher somatic mutation rates than tumors.  although the er/pr/her <dig> show the consistent patterns between cells and tumors, the other proteins in the rppa platforms do not. clustering analysis on protein expression data can reasonably recover the breast cancer subtypes in both cells and tumors. however, low correlations were observed between cells and tumors in phosphorylated proteins.  nearly 50 % gene expressions are not consistent with their protein levels both in tumors and cell lines. the high and low of gene expression is irrelevant to the translation processing from mrna to protein directly. nevertheless, important drug targets in breast cancer, such as esr <dig>  pgr, her <dig>  egfr and ar possess highly correlated in mrna-protein expression both in tumors and cell lines.  a total similarity score developed from the four correlations among four molecular profiles suggests that cell lines, bt <dig>  t47d and mdamb <dig> have the highest similarity with tumors.
