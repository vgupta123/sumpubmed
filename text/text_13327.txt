BACKGROUND
cvs is a common serious complication after the spontaneous sah. it induces and aggravates cerebral ischemic injury and becomes one of the major causes of disability and mortality after aneurysm rupture. although some medications like non-selective calcium blockers can be administered, there is still lack of especially effective clinical treatment to alleviate and improve cvs  <cit> . how to prevent and improve cvs is an urgent problem facing the neurosurgeons. studies have confirmed that in addition to regulating metabolism, promoting cell growth and proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis, insulin also plays a strong vasoactive role, dilates the vessels, increases blood flow, and improves metabolism in tissues  <cit> . the vasodilatory effect of insulin is achieved through increasing the synthesis and release of no in vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . the post-sah oxidation of oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin and the release of large amount of oxygen free radicals cause serious injury in endothelial cells, which becomes one of the major mechanisms underlying the occurrence of cvs and the brain damage. although vitamin c cannot directly dilate the blood vessels, it has powerful antioxidant effect to remove and inhibit oxygen free radicals and to improve the function of endothelial cells  <cit> , thus may help insulin in regulating blood vessels. therefore, this study has investigated the therapeutic effect of combinatorial use of insulin and vitamin c in treatment of post-sah cvs in a rabbit model to provide experimental basis for future clinical treatment.

immunohistochemistry
the expressions of inrα in basilar artery endothelial cells in sah, sah + insulin, and sah + vitamin c groups are significantly lower than that in control group , whereas the inrα expression in endothelial cells in sah + insulin + vitamin c group has been significantly increased and different from those in sah + insulin and sah + vitamin c groups .

hematoxylin and eosin  staining
staining of the sections from sah group shows significant thickening of the basilar artery wall, shrinkage, detachment, and falling off of the endothelial cells, manifesting typical battlement-like changes . sah + insulin or sah + vitamin c group shows evident vessel wall thickening, battlement-like change, endothelial cell shrinkage, and detachment , whereas combinatorial treatment group exhibits mild thickening of the vessel wall and stretch of the endothelial cells with rare or no detachment .

no content
in the fifth day after sah, no levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid decrease significantly . after combinatorial treatment with insulin and vitamin c, no level increases significantly in serum and cerebrospinal fluid , whereas insulin or vitamin c alone fails to increase the no level .

glucose and insulin contents
serum glucose level in the animals shows significant transient increase at  <dig> min after the blood injection, which is significantly higher than the normal reference value , but exhibits no significant changes at other times after the injection. although serum insulin increases at  <dig> min after the blood injection and remains at a higher level, the difference is not significant when compared to the original level before the blood injection; however, the differences become significant at the third and fifth days after the injection .

discussion
in this study, combinatorial use of insulin and vitamin c has successfully alleviated the cvs after sah, though individual administration of either insulin or vitamin c fails to achieve the desired effects, which confirms the destructive effect of oxygen free radicals on vascular endothelial cells and the significant vasodilatory effect of insulin. these results are consistent with those from hirashima et al.  <cit> .

insulin resistance is the state of tissues and organs with reduced sensitivity to insulin. previous studies have confirmed that inhibition of insulin's vasoactive effect induces insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which is the major cause of atherosclerosis and coronary artery spasm  <cit> . the present study has demonstrated that one day after blood injection, the cross-sectional area of basilar artery in experimental animals decreases significantly with apparent constriction of the blood vessels, which becomes mostly significant at the third day post blood injection , relieves then gradually, and recovers at the fifth day. although the glucose level only increases within  <dig> min after the blood injection, the plasma insulin level begins to rise continuously  <dig> min after the injection and reaches its maximum  <dig> days after the second injection, implying that cvs is associated with hyperinsulinemia. experiments have confirmed that sustained high insulin level may promote the pathological changes of blood vessels, which forms an independent risk factor for vascular diseases. firstly, hyperinsulinemia itself may downregulate insulin receptor by reducing the number and expression of insulin receptor in vascular endothelial cells, resulting in insulin resistance  <cit> ; secondly, hyperinsulinemia activates protein kinase c  and abnormally increases its activity; thirdly, hyperinsulinemia promotes the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and the synthesis and secretion of endothelin- <dig>  in endothelial cells  <cit> . these delayed pathophysiological changes are also characteristic in cvs after sah  <cit> .

therefore, according to the results of this study, it is reasonable to speculate that insulin resistance also exists in the present model of cvs after sah. the number and expression of insulin receptor on the membrane of endothelial cells in the basilar artery with severe spasm have been significantly reduced, whereas the expression of insulin receptor on the endothelial cells of basilar artery without spasm is strongly positive. downregulation of the number and expression of insulin receptor causes insulin resistance and inhibition of the various physiological effects of insulin, including its vasoactive effect  <cit> . vascular endothelial cells are the target cells for insulin to exert its vascular regulatory effects. extensive studies have demonstrated that there are a large number of insulin receptors on vascular endothelial cells; upon binding with insulin, the downstream signaling pathways are activated to further stimulate the production of et- <dig> and no in endothelial cells, adjust the balance of vascular constriction, and hence exert the vasoactive effect  <cit> . however, as shown in this study, the vascular endothelial cells are damaged after sah; the number and expression of insulin receptor on these cells are reduced significantly, resulting in insufficient binding with insulin and failure in promoting the release of the vasodilatory factor no, which hampers the vasoactive effect of insulin. therefore, treatment with insulin alone fails to alleviate the cvs, whereas combinatorial use of insulin and vitamin c effectively relieve the symptom. vitamin c is an antioxidant; although itself has no direct role on the vasomotor and hemodynamics  <cit> , vitamin c can counteract the damaging effect of oxygen free radicals on the endothelial cells, improve cell function, reduce insulin resistance, increase the sensitivity to insulin in endothelial cells, promote the binding of insulin with its receptor, and thereby increase the release of vasodilatory factor no to exert its vasoactive effect. in addition, vitamin c can inhibit the activity of oxygen free radicals and inhibit their binding to no, thus facilitating the vasodilatory effect of no  <cit> . therefore, combinatorial use of insulin and vitamin c has significantly improved cvs in animals of sah + insulin + vitamin c group.

however, the most serious complication of insulin therapy is low blood glucose reaction. in this study, the blood glucose has been controlled at a level higher than  <dig>  mmol/l , and there is no occurrence of twitch, coma, and other symptoms in the animals due to low blood glucose level.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has successfully alleviated the post-sah cvs in rabbit through combinatorial treatment with insulin and vitamin c. however, since the cerebral vascular structures in human are significantly different from that in rabbit, the effect of this method in treating cvs in human needs further investigations.
