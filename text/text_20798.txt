BACKGROUND
lignans are a class of diphenolic nonsteroidal phytoestrogens with a wide variety of purported health benefits  <cit> . different types of lignans have been reported in various plant species and include secoisolariciresinol diglucoside  found mainly in flax   <cit> . flax seeds are a rich source of sdg lignans that have been associated with positive roles in the prevention of chronic metabolic diseases in human  <cit> .

in planta, lignans are usually found glycosylated in oligomeric chains  <cit> . glycosylation is a key mechanism that determines the chemical complexity and diversity of plant natural products  <cit> , ensures their chemical stability and water solubility while reducing chemical reactivity or toxicity  <cit> , and facilitates their sorting, intercellular transport, storage and accumulation in plant cells  <cit> . glycosylation is one of the key modifications in the secondary metabolite biosynthesis and is catalyzed by carbohydrate active enzymes  which include the superfamily of glycosyltransferases   <cit> . the specific glycosylation position in biologically active compounds may serve to modulate their pharmacological activity and/or to alter and optimize their potential use as drugs  <cit> . members of the gt superfamily have been classified into  <dig> families where family  <dig> refers to the uridine glycosyl transferases   <cit> . plant ugts are often characterized by a  <dig> amino acid consensus signature motif, the plant secondary product glycosyltransferase  box  <cit> . ugts transfer udp-activated sugar moieties, including udp-glucose, to specific acceptor molecules  <cit> . based on sequence homology, more than  <dig> ugts have been reported in arabidopsis and were grouped into  <dig> sub-families classified as ugt <dig> to ugt <dig>  <cit> . in the course of this study, the flax draft genome was released  <cit> . barvkar et al.  <cit>  probed this flax draft genome and reported  <dig> flax ugts but did not assign functions to any of these ugts.

pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases  are key enzymes for the catalysis of the first biosynthetic steps of lignans in many plant species, including flax. these enzymes sequentially reduce pinoresinol formed by the coupling of two molecules of coniferyl alcohol  in the presence of dirigent proteins  <cit> . recently, noguchi et al.  <cit>  reported two ugts, ugt71a <dig> and ugt94d <dig>  that sequentially glycosylated furofuran lignan -sesaminol in sesamum indicum to form -sesaminol 2–o–β-d-glucosyl -o--β-d-glucoside . stg and sdg are structurally quite different. in stg, the glucosyl moieties form a trisaccharide side chain while in sdg, the sugars are attached at two different hydroxyl groups of the secoisolariciresinol backbone . hence, the ugts that glycosylate sesamine into sesaminol are likely to differ from those glycosylating secoisolaricresinol . although cdnas encoding for plrs that specifically convert pinoresinol into  and  enantiomers of seco have been cloned and functionally characterized in flax  <cit> , much less is known about the ugts that glucosylate seco aglycones into sdg in flax.

to gain insights into sdg lignan glucosylation with potential applications in lignan metabolism engineering, we attempted to identify and characterize flax ugts responsible for seco glucosylation. using database mining, molecular cloning, heterologous expression and enzyme assays, we isolated five putative udp-glycosyltransferases from flax seeds and demonstrated that ugt74s <dig> glucosylated seco, forming sequentially seco monoglucoside  and then sdg. the findings, not only reported the first functional characterization of a seco specific ugt in flax, but also pave the way for engineered sdg lignan metabolite species in vitro and in planta.

RESULTS
library mining and ugt cloning
using  <dig> napgen est library-derived gene-specific ugt primers and one degenerate  primer, a total of  <dig> combinations produced unique pcr products of the expected sizes. the partial cdna sequences were analyzed using blastx which confirmed the identity of each sequence as belonging to the ugt family. a clustalw multiple sequence alignment showed that some of them were the same and a consensus phylogenetic tree revealed that eight were unique . subsequently, one representative sequence from each of the eight ugts was selected for the design of gene-specific primers, and full length cdnas for five different ugts were obtained . cl <dig> was  <dig>  kb while cl <dig>  cl <dig>  rp <dig>  and rp <dig> were all ~ <dig>  kb . the unique ugt sequences were classified as belonging to four families and five sub-families as per the nomenclature of the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology and the iupac-iubmb joint committee responsible for udp-glycosyltransferases  <cit>  and designated ugt74s <dig> , ugt94h <dig> , ugt89b <dig> , ugt74t <dig>  and ugt712b <dig> . their sequences were submitted to genbank under accession numbers jx <dig> to jx <dig> 

ugt structural gene organization
the structural organization of the  <dig> ugt genes was obtained using the flax wgs sequence assembly . the length of the ugt genes varied from 1597 bp to 2521 bp. of the  <dig> flax genomic dna regions corresponding to each of the full length ugt cdnas,  <dig> had one intron, and one, ugt89b <dig>  was intron free. all five were predicted to encode proteins of 379– <dig> amino acids. the intronic regions varied from  <dig> to 739 bp among the  <dig> ugts whereas the exonic regions ranged between  <dig> to 1431 bp. the size of the amplified spliced cdna for each of the  <dig> ugt genes  matched very closely with the exon size of the flax genomic dna. the length of the 5′ un-translated region  varied between 46 bp and 313 bp while the 3′ utr ranged from 172 bp to 442 bp. although showing the shortest spliced cdna, ugt94h <dig> appeared to be the largest ugt, with a size of 2521 bp .

pspg motif characterization
using the expasy prosite scan tool, the position of the pspg conserved motif at the c-terminal of the open reading frame  was determined. the orf of all five flax ugts displayed the pspg-box that is characteristic of ugts’ family  <dig> . the conserved motif of  <dig> amino acids contains the tetra amino acid sequence hcgw, the most conserved signature among all the families. the  <dig> amino acids flanking the hcgw region of flax ugt94h <dig> showed 75% identity  with that of sesame lignan glycosylation ugt94d <dig> gene , and an overall 66% identity over the  <dig> amino acids of the pspg. similarly, the pspg of the flax ugt ugt89b <dig> shared an overall 64% identity with the sesame lignan glycosylation gene ugt71a <dig>  and a 66% identity among the  <dig> amino acids flanking the hcgw region. the identity between  <dig> amino acids flanking the hcgw region of ugt74s <dig> and that of the sesame ugt71a <dig>  on one hand, and between ugt74s <dig> and ugt94d <dig>  on the other hand was  <dig> and 42%, and with an overall identity of  <dig> and 43%, respectively. among the ugts, higher variations were observed at the n-terminal region than at the c-terminal after a clustalw multiple sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences .

tissue-specific in silico est analysis of ugts
a blastn search against the flax est database that includes libraries from  <dig> different tissues revealed a higher level of expression in embryo and seed coat . ugt712b <dig> expression was exclusively detected in the globular and heart stage embryos  whereas ugt94h <dig> was expressed in the torpedo  and cotyledon stage embryos , as well as in the torpedo stage seed coat  . ugt74s <dig>  ugt74t <dig> and ugt89b <dig> were found exclusively in globular  and torpedo stage seed coat . ugt74s <dig> and ugt74t <dig> were the most abundant with  <dig> est hits each in the tc est library.

quantitative expression of ugts and plr in developing flax seed, leaf and stem tissues
gene expression of the five ugts and one plr of flax cultivar ac mcduff differed for the different genes, amongst tissues and developmental stages . in developing seeds, ugt74s <dig> expression followed a bell curve pattern with peak expression at 16 days after anthesis  . ugt94h <dig> expression peaked at  <dig> daa, declined at  <dig> daa, and maintained a relatively stable expression afterwards until maturity . ugt89b <dig> showed an exponential increase of expression from  <dig> daa to maturity . ugt74t <dig> was expressed at a low level between 0– <dig> daa followed by a sharp increase at  <dig> daa and at maturity . ugt712b <dig> was expressed at low and stable levels across all six seed developmental stages . low levels of expression were observed for ugt74s <dig> and ugt94h <dig> in the leaf and stem tissues. in contrast, ugt89b <dig> was highly expressed in both vegetative tissues as compared to  <dig> daa seeds. the expression of ugt74t <dig> was higher in stems while that of ugt712b <dig> was higher in leaves compared to other tissues . the plr expression pattern was similar to that of ugt74s <dig> with peak expression at  <dig> daa and no expression in leaf and stem tissue .

sdg lignan profiling
sdg lignan biosynthesis was assessed at six seed developmental stages of flax cultivar ac mcduff. the sdg lignan level was negligible between  <dig> and  <dig> daa where a coniferin-like compound constituted the major metabolite observed at these stages . the sdg lignan steadily increased starting at  <dig> daa until  <dig> daa when it started to plateau .

heterologous expression of flax ugts and enzyme activities
to ascertain a functional role for each of the five ugts in sdg lignan biosynthesis, their full length cdnas were expressed in yeast. all five proteins were highly expressed after eight hours of induction with 2% galactose and the molecular weight of the expressed proteins along with the histidine-tag were  <dig>  kda for ugt74s <dig>   <dig>  kda for ugt94h <dig>   <dig>  kda for ugt89b <dig>   <dig>  kda for ugt74t <dig>  and  <dig>  kda for ugt712b <dig>  in agreement with their predicted sequences . following the release of the flax draft genome, a flax ugt  was reported  <cit> . this ugt clone is 100% identical to ugt74s <dig> at the amino acid and nucleotide levels but is predicted to be  <dig> nucleotides  shorter at the 5′ end than ugt74s <dig>  reported here . for functional comparison purposes, a cdna derived from ugt accession number jn <dig>  was also cloned and expressed in yeast. as expected, a smaller peptide of only 47 kda was observed compared to  <dig>  kda for ugt74s <dig> . the gene corresponding to jn <dig>  is hereafter referred to as truncated ugt74s <dig> .

enzyme assays and reactions conditions
to identify the flax ugts potentially involved in seco glycosylation, 50 μg of crude recombinant protein for each of the  <dig> ugts expressed in yeast was assayed with different aglycones including secoisloariciresinol, sillibinin, quercetin, kaempferol, coumaric acid, caffeic acid, sinnapic acid, cinnamic acid and ferulic acid . only ugt74s <dig> exhibited an activity by producing two new peaks using only seco as a substrate .

to confirm the identity of the observed peaks, the enzyme reaction was spiked with sdg and resolved alongside various controls and standards . a negative control without enzymes , positive controls with standard sdg , positive controls with standard smg  and standard seco  were included. the detected smg peak  <dig> was higher than the detected sdg  . the identity of the small peak  <dig> was confirmed by spiking a known amount of standard sdg to the reaction products prior to uplc analysis; the resulting peak increased in size and eluted with an identical retention time as the standard sdg . thus, glucosylation of seco into smg primarily, and sdg to a smaller extent, occurred in the presence of ugt74s <dig> .

to ascertain these observations, the five enzymes were further purified using 6x his-tagged nickel chelating purification system and 50 μg of the purified proteins were reacted with seco. similar to the crude protein, only the purified ugt74s <dig> showed the same two new peaks when seco was used as a substrate . contrary to the reaction with the crude protein, the purified protein produced a higher sdg level compared to smg . thus, enzyme purification enhanced seco glycosylation into sdg by ugt74s <dig> 

liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry  analysis allowed a better characterization of the de novo synthesized smg and sdg. the two new products exhibited a molecular ion at mass-to-charge ratio  of  <dig> and  <dig>  - for smg and sdg, respectively, consistent with their known mw . 1h, 13c correlation spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr experiments of the lc purified peaks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> confirmed their identities , closely matching previous reports for these compounds  <cit> .

ugt74s <dig> biochemical parameters
different ph ranges, temperatures, cofactors and enzyme concentrations were assayed to optimize the ugt74s <dig> reaction with seco. the optimal ph was determined to be  <dig> , with a low activity below ph  <dig>  and at  <dig>  . optimal temperature for ugt74s <dig> activity was at 30°c . all the cofactors evaluated in this study activated the ugt74s <dig> enzyme at 1 mm, except for feso <dig> which activated at 10 mm . a concentration of 10 mm mgcl <dig>  mncl <dig>  cacl <dig>  or cuso <dig> inhibited ugt74s <dig> activity. of the cofactors tested, nacl was the most effective catalyst . increased concentration of ugt74s <dig> from 10–120 μg increased activity up to 80 μg, after which a saturation effect was observed . these optimal biochemical parameters  were subsequently used in the rest of the study.

because ugt94h <dig>  ugt89b <dig>  ugt74t <dig> and ugt712b <dig> did not glycosylate seco into smg, further tests were conducted to determine if they were involved in the glucosylation of smg to form sdg. since smg is not commercially available, sdg was hydrolyzed to smg  <cit> . using this smg as a substrate, the five ugts were assayed. but again, only ugt74s <dig> showed a peak corresponding to sdg retention time . therefore, ugt89b <dig>  ugt74t <dig>  ugt712b <dig>  and ugt94h <dig> appeared not to be involved in sdg lignan glycosylation and their biochemical function remains to be elucidated. thus, ugt74s <dig> was the only flax ugt cloned and identified in this study that used seco as a substrate, first producing smg and then sdg in a sequential manner. its truncated version trugt74s <dig> was also assayed using the optimal conditions set for ugt74s <dig> and was also unable to glucosylate seco .

ugt74s <dig> kinetic parameters
by reacting ugt74s <dig> with seco at ph  <dig>  and 30°c, the catalytic efficiency  for sdg production was determined to be  <dig>  sec− <dig>  the estimated apparent km values toward seco and udp-glucose for sdg production were determined to be  <dig> and 1188 μm, respectively.

discussion
ugts are a large and complex family of enzymes that catalyze glycosidic bond formation. to get a better understanding of ugts that may play a role in the glycosylation process of flax sdg lignan, we undertook the cloning and characterization of flax ugts. we identified and characterized five flax full length ugts, namely ugt74s <dig>  ugt94h <dig>  ugt89b <dig>  ugt74t <dig>  and ugt712b <dig>  we found that ugt74s <dig> and ugt94h <dig> were highly expressed in developing seed and their expression was coordinated with that of plr, the first-step lignan biosynthetic gene  <cit> , and well correlated with the sdg lignan biosynthesis patterns in seed. by expressing each of the five ugts and reacting the purified proteins with seco and udp-glucose, only ugt74s <dig> produced both smg and sdg metabolites. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration linking any flax ugt gene to sdg lignan biosynthesis.

the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology and iupac-iubmb joint committee responsible for udp-glycosyltransferase  <cit>  classified the five ugts into four families and five sub-families, representing five distinct genes. in the course of this study, barvkar et al.  <cit>  probed the recently released flax genome  and reported  <dig> flax ugts including homologs to our reported ugt74s <dig> , ugt94h <dig> , ugt89b <dig>  and ugt712b <dig> . these were not, however, characterized with regards to their functionality towards aglycones. moreover, trugt74s <dig>  was  <dig> amino acids shorter than ugt74s <dig> described herein . we provided convincing evidence that trugt74s <dig> is unable to glucosylate seco into sdg, and is thereby not functional . the  <dig> amino acids missing in trugt74s <dig> seem to be essential for glucosyltransferase activity.

the ugts described in this study differed in their structural organization, primary sequence, and in their pspg motifs. coding sequence variation among plant ugt family  <dig> members is generally high, varying from less than 35% to more than 95% overall identity  <cit> , with the c-terminal regions that contain the pspg box being more conserved  <cit> . although well conserved, diversity within the pspg motif of the five flax ugt genes was revealed. at the structural level, one of the ugts had no introns while the remaining four had one intron each, which varied in size from  <dig> to 739 bp. in arabidopsis, more than half of the ugts have no introns  <cit>  and those with introns were much smaller , a difference somewhat proportional to the genome size differences of ~370 mb for flax and 135 mb for arabidopsis. differences were also observed in the spliced coding sequence  sizes , further emphasizing the diversity within the ugt family and in agreement with its recent origin hypothesis  <cit> .

although ugt family  <dig> is a very diverse gene superfamily, its members are usually classified based on their sequence identity  <cit>  and the presence of the conserved pspg motif  <cit>  that includes key conserved residues for substrate recognition and catalysis  <cit> . the ugts described herein all possessed the conserved  <dig> amino acid pspg motif and the two peptide sequences, wapqv and hcgwns, present in 95% of all β-group gts analysed to date  <cit> . amino acid variations were nonetheless observed  in these two short peptide motifs as well as in the c-terminal of the pspg-box  <cit> . sugar donor specificity has been attributed to the pspg box  <cit> . for example, substitution of tryptophan  at position  <dig>  for arginine  sufficed to modify the sugar donor specificity from upd-glucose to udp galacturonic acid in lamiale <cit> . the domain involved in the recognition and binding of the diverse aglycone substrates is purported to be located towards the n-terminal end, whereas the c-terminal region encodes a domain involved in binding the nucleotide sugar substrate  <cit> .

transcriptome analyses revealed that the flax ugts reported here were expressed predominantly in embryo and seed specific libraries  <cit> . these results were validated and quantified by qpcr. the expression of plr, ugt74s <dig>  and ugt94h <dig> appeared to be coordinated and correlated with sdg lignan accumulation in the seed. despite the similar expression pattern of ugt74s <dig> and ugt94h <dig> and their correlations with sdg lignan accumulation in developing seed, only ugt74s <dig> was demonstrated to metabolize seco, first into smg and then into sdg lignan. because free smg has not yet been reported in planta, the occurrence of an enzyme that glucosylates only seco or smg cannot be ruled out in flax but would not be essential considering that ugt74s <dig> is capable of catalyzing the last two steps. hence, we propose the following model for the sequential glucosylation of seco by ugt74s <dig> to form sdg via a smg intermediate .

the optimal enzyme conditions  for ugt74s <dig> were established and fall within the range of the majority of udp-glycosyltransferases  <cit> . ugt74s <dig> was found to be sensitive to increased ionic strength of metal ions as reported for other udp-glycosyltransferases  <cit> . the ugt74s <dig> apparent km for udp–glucose was higher than that for seco, and fall in the km ranges previously reported  <cit> . the catalytic efficiency  of ugt74s <dig> for seco was close to that of ugt71a <dig> and ugt94d <dig> reported by noguchi et al.  <cit> . none of the flavonoid or phenolic acid aglycone substrates tested in this study served as good substrates for ugt74s <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have cloned five ugts from flax seeds and demonstrated through a comprehensive multi-approach analysis that ugt74s <dig> was a functional enzyme capable of converting seco into sdg. our results suggest that ugt74s <dig> is involved in secoisolariciresinol glucosylation in planta to form flax sdg lignan. the findings shed more clarity in flax lignan biochemistry and provide the necessary background to conduct site directed mutagenesis studies.
