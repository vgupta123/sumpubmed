BACKGROUND
hepatitis b virus  is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic dna virus that is capable of inducing acute and chronic necroinflammatory liver injury  <cit> . outcome of patients infected with hbv is closely associated with the extent of host immune response  <cit> . moderate immune responses will mediate the clearance of hbv infection, while excessive responses will induce liver injury and low level responses will allow hbv residence. unfortunately, patients with chronic hepatitis b  often exhibit impaired hbv-specific t cell responses  <cit> . the exact mechanisms of the immune system that fail in chb infections remain unclear and, thus, remain a hindrance to the development of effective therapies.

many mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the inadequate immune responses that facilitate chronic hbv infection. the most recent has focused on the dysfunction of regulatory t  cells. treg cells are characterized by their cell-specific expression of forkhead box p <dig>   <cit> , a transcription factor that contributes to autoimmune functions. studies have demonstrated that foxp3+ treg cells can inhibit activation, proliferation and effector functions of several kinds of other immune cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, natural killer  and nkt cells, b cells and dendritic cells . as such, foxp3+ treg cells are widely considered to be the principal mediator of dominant self-tolerance and immune homeostasis and to contribute to prevention of autoimmune disease, immunopathology and allergy  <cit> . in hbv patients, foxp3+ treg cells have been associated with the incidence and extent of liver damage  <cit> .

chronic inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis, is most commonly caused by infection with hbv. many other inflammation-related diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma  <cit> , have been characterized as having significant dysfunctions in the interleukin -23/il- <dig> signaling pathway. interestingly, il- <dig> has been associated with the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis b in humans  <cit> ; however, the relationship between foxp3+ tregs and the il-23/il- <dig> pathway  has not yet been investigated in hbv infected individuals.

this study was designed to elucidate the foxp3-mediated activity of the il-23/il- <dig> signaling pathway in hbv-infected patients. we found that both foxp <dig> and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines were sharply increased in patients with chb, as compared to healthy controls. we also determined that foxp <dig> gene expression was positively associated with the presence of il-23/il- <dig> pathway cytokines at sites of inflammation. these findings suggest that both foxp <dig> and the il-23/il- <dig> pathway are involved in inflammatory response to hepatitis b infection, and may interact with one another in chb patients.

methods
patients and samples
one hundred and ten hbv-infected patients including thirty-nine acute-on-chronic liver failure  and seventy-one chronic hepatitis b patients  were recruited for the study and enrolled when written, informed consent was obtained. each patient was hospitalized and clinically followed upon release in the department of infectious diseases, southwest hospital, third military medical university. the study period lasted from december  <dig> to january  <dig>  all individuals were confirmed as hbv positive, and negative for c and d types  and human immunodeficiency virus. clinical records and self-reporting indicated that no anti-hbv agents or steroids were administered six months before study sampling. twenty-four healthy blood donors  and eight healthy liver tissue samples from liver transplantation patients were also selected. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the third military medical university, chongqing, china. informed consent was obtained from all patients. the clinical characteristics of our patient cohort and healthy controls are shown in table  <dig> 

flow cytometry  analysis
the following antibodies were used: af750-conjugated anti-cd <dig> , percp-cy <dig> conjugated anti-cd <dig>  and apc-conjugated anti- foxp <dig>  peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were obtained by ficoll gradient. cells were then stained to detect relevant surface markers, fixed, permeabilized with cytofix/cytoperm solution , and stained with anti- foxp <dig>  detection was carried out on a facsaria cell sorter , and data were analyzed by flowjo v.  <dig>  .

total rna isolation and quantitative pcr
pbmc and liver tissues were dissolved in trizol  for total rna extraction. rt-pcr was carried out on the rna product by using the primescript™ rt reagents kit , following the manufacturer's directions. quantitative real-time pcr was performed using the sybr® premix ex taq™ . gene-specific primers for human il- <dig>  il- <dig>  foxp <dig>  tnf-α and il- <dig> were designed as shown in table  <dig>  fluorescence signals were measured after  <dig> pcr cycles, and all samples were normalized to gapdh housekeeping gene levels. all samples were run in duplicate.

immunohistochemistry analysis
liver tissues were embedded in paraffin using the standard protocol. immunohistochemistry for human foxp <dig> was performed as previously described, with minor modifications  <cit> . briefly, masked antigens were uncovered by microwaving for  <dig> min in citrate buffer, ph  <dig> . after cooling at room temperature, non-specific binding was blocked by exposure to 5% bovine serum albumin  in phosphate-buffered saline  for  <dig> min. incubation with primary antibodies for foxp <dig>  was carried out for  <dig> h at 4°c in a humidified chamber before the slides were incubated with secondary, biotin-conjugated antibody, followed by sequential incubation with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and the peroxidase substrate 3'-diaminobenzidine. samples were then counterstained with hematoxylin.

for the double staining of anti- foxp <dig> plus anti-cd <dig> and anti- foxp <dig> plus anti-cd <dig>  the first antibody  was applied for  <dig> h at 4°c in a humidified chamber. the second antibody, anti-human cd <dig> and cd <dig> , was then applied for overnight at 4°c. cy3-labeled anti-goat igg  and dylight488-labeled anti-mouse igg   were applied for  <dig> min at 37°c. nuclear counterstaining was performed by incubating stained samples with diaminidophenylindol  for  <dig> min. normal mouse or goat igg was used as a negative control. images were obtained by the digital confocal laser scanning system mrc- <dig> .

western blot
total protein of liver tissue was extracted using t-per® tissue protein extraction reagent  and quantified with bca™ protein assay . the proteins were separated on a 16% sds-page and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes for immunoblotting. the membranes were incubated with goat anti-human il- <dig> , mouse anti-human il-23p <dig>  and mouse anti-human foxp <dig>  for  <dig> h at room temperature, respectively. after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat igg, or rat anti-mouse igg for  <dig> h at room temperature, specific protein bands on the membranes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method , according to the manufacturer's instructions.

virological assessment
the virological assay was performed as previously described  <cit> .

statistical analysis
comparisons between various groups were performed using the mann-whitney u test. results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation , unless otherwise noted. correlations between variables were evaluated using the spearman's rank correlation. for all tests, 2-sided p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
foxp <dig> expression is significantly high in peripheral blood of chb patients
tregs with transcription factor foxp <dig> play an pivotal role in controlling immune response mediated inflammation  <cit> . several reports have shown evidence that treg cells are involved in hepatitis b pathogenesis  <cit> . to further explore the role of foxp <dig> in patients with hepatitis b, we collected the peripheral blood from  <dig> chb patients and  <dig> aclf patients, and then evaluated the expression of foxp <dig> as detected by qpcr and fcm assays. as shown in figure 1a, the expression of foxp <dig> mrna was found to be significantly increased in pbmc of chb and aclf patients, as compared with healthy controls. fcm assays indicated that the foxp3+ t cell portion of cd4+ t cells were markedly up-regulated in hbv-infected patients; the aclf patients had the most foxp3+ t cells .

foxp <dig> is significantly augmented in liver tissue of patients infected with hbv
to further value the role of foxp <dig> in patients with hepatitis b, we detected the expression level of foxp <dig> in liver tissue from patients infected by hbv by using qpcr and immunohistochemistry techniques. concordant with the data from xu et al.  <cit>  and janssen's group  <cit> , foxp <dig> was found to be mainly localized to cells near the hepatic portal tract, and foxp <dig> expression was significantly higher in hbv patients than in healthy controls . we further investigated the distribution patterns of foxp <dig> expression in hbv-infected liver tissue by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. results revealed that foxp <dig> in hbv-infected liver tissues was predominantly present in cd4+ t cells, and not in cd8+ t cells .

increased foxp <dig> expression is positively correlated with hbv persistence in host liver
in order to evaluate the relationship between foxp <dig> expression and clinical symptom of patients with chb, we analyzed the foxp <dig> expression in liver tissue and plasma hbv dna copies, hepatitis b surface antigen  concentration, and serum alanine aminotransferase  level in  <dig> chb patients. there was significant association between foxp <dig> expression and hbv dna copies or hbsag concentration, but not alt . these results suggested that foxp <dig> was involved in the persistent presence of hbv in chb patients, but not directly involved in liver injury.

expression of il-23/il- <dig> pathway proinflammatory cytokines was significantly high in hbv-infected liver tissues
inflammatory responses are significant features of hepatitis b pathogenesis. it has been reported that the il-23/il- <dig> pathway plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases  <cit> . moreover, foxp <dig> is closely related to the il-23/il- <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . in order to further elucidate the role of foxp <dig> in patients with chb, we detected the expression of il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines in chb liver samples. as shown in figure 4a, the mrna expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α, and il- <dig> was significantly higher in these patients liver tissues than in healthy controls. we then investigated whether the protein expression of the key genes, foxp <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> genes, was also enhanced in chb liver tissues by western-blot assay. results showed that the protein expression of these three genes in liver tissue of chb patients was significantly elevated in comparison with that of hc , suggesting treg cells and th <dig> cells might play important roles simultaneously in chb pathogenesis.

foxp <dig> expression is positively correlated with presence of il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines in liver tissue from chb patients
foxp <dig> is a potent mediator of dominant self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. nistala et al.  <cit>  demonstrated an inverse relationship between il-17+ t cells and foxp3+ treg cells in joint tissues of children suffering from juvenile arthritis. the fact that foxp <dig> and il-23/il- <dig> pathway cytokines were both significantly increased in patients with chb led us to examine the relationship between these molecules in liver tissues infected with hbv. we found that foxp <dig> was significantly correlated with the presence of il- <dig> and il- <dig> at sites of inflammation .

discussion
immune-mediated liver injury is the key feature of hepatitis b pathogenesis. recently, much attention has been paid to the importance of treg cells in chronic hbv infection  <cit> . in the study described herein, we investigated the expression levels of foxp <dig>  and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines in hbv-infected liver tissue. we found that foxp <dig> and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines were significantly higher at sites of inflammation. moreover, the expression of foxp <dig> was closely correlated with the presence of il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines.

the inflammatory response is necessary to clearance of pathogenic agents, but a fine balance must be maintained so that chronic inflammation does not damage healthy tissues. treg cells that express foxp <dig> play a key role in regulating this delicate equilibrium  <cit> . several studies of hbv infection have found that treg cells are functionally involved in the hepatic immunological responses  <cit> . likewise, we also observed foxp <dig> expression in cd4+ t cells, and not in cd8+ t cells. moreover, the expression of foxp <dig> was significantly increased and in liver tissue of chb patients. moreover the mrna level of foxp <dig> at sites of hepatic inflammation was closely correlated with levels of hbv dna copies and hbsag. these results indicated that foxp <dig> expression was likely to support established residence of hbv.

recently, clinical investigations have shown that the il-23/il- <dig> signaling pathway contributes to the inflammatory reaction of crohn's disease, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . il- <dig> is known as the immune-modulatory factor of th <dig> cells, while il- <dig> functions to elicit the differentiation and mediate the function of th <dig> cells  <cit> . several groups have reported that the il- <dig> pathway was involved in human liver disease  <cit> . our results evidenced that the activity of the il-23/il- <dig> pathway was significantly elevated in liver tissues of patients infected by hepatitis b virus, as compared to that in healthy controls. these results indicated that the il-23/il- <dig> pathway, rather than il- <dig> alone, is involved in the pathological process of hepatitis b infection.

th <dig> cells and treg cells both arise from the naive cd4+ t cell population and share reciprocal development pathways. but, they have opposite immunomodulatory effects, and the balance between them controls inflammation and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . many studies have identified an imbalance in th <dig> cells and treg cells that occurs in conjunction with disease  <cit> . in the present study, we found that expression of foxp <dig> and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines were increased in inflamed hepatic tissues in chb patients. we also found that foxp <dig> expression was significantly correlated with levels of il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines in the livers of these chb patients . several studies have demonstrated that the development of th <dig> cells and treg cells may be interrelated, as they are both dependent on tgf-β  <cit> . yet, they appear to be reciprocally influenced by various cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  as well as il- <dig> and the vitamin a metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid  <cit> . tgf-β is central to the development and function of th <dig> and treg cells. on one hand, tgf-β induces the expression of foxp <dig>  <cit> ; on the other hand, tgf-β has been shown to be absolutely required for th <dig> differentiation in a serum-free system using cord blood-derived cd4+ t cells  <cit> . a recent study also showed that tregs themselves may differentiate into il-17-producing cells, particularly when exposed to exogenous il-1β, il- <dig> or il- <dig>  <cit> . in psoriasis patients, zhang et al. found that th <dig> cells were positively correlated with the presence of treg cells, both in the circulation and in skin tissue lesions  <cit> . based on these data, we propose that tregs may act to promote the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  at certain time points during the course of hbv infection. considering that the inflammatory response is crucial for clearance of pathogenic microorganisms, it is reasonable that the occurrence of pro-inflammatory immune cells, such as th <dig>  will be accompanied by inhibitory tregs cells. in this way, the significant correlation between treg cells and th <dig> cells in the liver of chb patients is fitting.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that foxp <dig> and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokines were both highly expressed in inflamed liver tissues infected by hepatitis b virus. moreover, the expression of foxp <dig> was significantly correlated with that of il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related cytokine genes in the infected liver. these findings support the hypothesis that proinflammatory th <dig>  cells in hbv-infected liver is accompanied by host inflammation-inhibitory machinery, such as treg  cells, in order to maintain balance between promotion and inhibition of the immune response. our results also suggested that the activity of the proinflammatory il-23/il- <dig> signaling pathway is not been efficiently controlled by the host inhibitory machinery, in this case the treg  cells; the constitutive activation of the il-23/il- <dig> signaling pathway may partially explain the hbv persistence that occurs in the chronic hepatitis b state. future studies will address the precise in vivo mechanism of the reciprocal regulation between foxp <dig> and the il-23/il- <dig> pathway, and will contribute to development of effective therapies to clear hbv from chb patients.
