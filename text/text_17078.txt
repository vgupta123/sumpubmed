BACKGROUND
alien cytoplasm largely alters gene expression profiles, affecting growth and organogenesis. nuclear-cytoplasm incompatibility results in abnormal growth phenotypes in higher plants  <cit> . recurrent backcrossing has been commonly used for production of nuclear-cytoplasmic substitution plants called alloplasmic lines, in which the cytoplasmic genomes are replaced by ones from a related species  <cit> . cytoplasmic male sterility is a major phenomenon among the abnormal phenotypes of the alloplasmic lines  <cit> . in many cases of cytoplasmic male sterility, nuclear-cytoplasm incompatibility induces abortion of pollen. homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures is sometimes observed in alloplasmic lines of carrot, brassica napus, tobacco and wheat  <cit> , a phenomenon called pistillody.

cytoplasm of a wild wheat relative, aegilops crassa, homeotically affects floral organ development and induces pistillody in some alloplasmic common wheat lines lacking fertility restorer genes against ae. crassa cytoplasm   <cit> . the mitochondrial orf <dig> gene in the ae. crassa cytoplasm might be associated with induction of the floral homeotic change  <cit> . an alloplasmic line of the wheat cultivar norin  <dig>  with ae. crassa cytoplasm  exhibits male sterility under long-day conditions  due to pistillody , a phenomenon termed photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> . however, an alloplasmic line of the wheat cultivar chinese spring  does not because of a fertility restorer gene rfd <dig>  located on the long arm of chromosome 7b   <cit> . an alloplasmic line of cs  with ae. crassa cytoplasm  lacking both long arms of the homologous chromosome 7b shows pistillody unrelated to day length , but cs ditelosomic 7bs with the intrinsic cytoplasm  forms normal stamens   <cit> .

the ae. crassa cytoplasm alters expression patterns of wheat class b mads-box genes at the floral meristem of -csdt7bs  <cit> . primordia of the pistil-like stamens lack expression of wheat apetala <dig>  and pistillata  orthologs such as wap <dig>  wpi- <dig> and wpi- <dig>  <cit> , whereas two wheat class c mads-box genes, wheat agamous paralogs , are ectopically expressed at the pistil-like stamens  <cit> . despite initiation of ovule formation in these transformed stamens, ectopic ovules incompletely develop, and the transformed stamens are sterile. in addition, pistils are also sterile in the -csdt7bs alloplasmic line, and female sterility is due to abnormal ovule development  <cit> . both the ovules and ectopic ovules fail to form an inner epidermis and integuments in the chalaza region. this incomplete development of the ovules strongly suggests alteration of gene expression patterns essential to normal ovule formation in pistils and pistil-like stamens of the -csdt7bs alloplasmic line. however, there is little information about gene expression associated with wheat ovule development.

following determination of carpel identity via agamous , a class c mads-box gene acting to specify stamen and carpel development in arabidopsis  <cit> , ovule primordia are initiated within pistils. the initiation of ovule primordium formation is caused by expression of class d mads-box genes such as arabidopsis seedstick  and petunia floral binding protein  <dig>  and fbp <dig>  <cit> . arabidopsis bsister  and fbp <dig> from petunia are members of the bsister subfamily, and are necessary to determine the identity of the endothelial layer within the inner integument of the ovule  <cit> . our previous study using wheat alloplasmic lines with ae. crassa cytoplasm demonstrated that alteration of class b and c mads-box genes was connected with continuous transcript accumulation of class d and bsister mads-box genes, wstk and wbsis, respectively, in primordia of ectopic ovules within the pistil-like stamens  <cit> . moreover, the wbsis transcript is not restricted to the endothelium and appears at the nucellus in ectopic ovules in -csdt7bs. arabidopsis aintegumenta  plays an important role in ovule development along the proximal-distal axis  <cit> . ant mutants fail to both initiate and elongate the integument  <cit> . the aberrant ovule formation is at least partly associated with the weak expression of a wheat ant homolog want- <dig> around ovule primordia in -csdt7bs  <cit> . therefore, alteration of gene expression after initiation of ovule primordia results in abnormal ovule development in alloplasmic wheat with ae. crassa cytoplasm.

arabidopsis homeodomain protein bell <dig>  is also required for ovule morphogenesis  <cit> , suggesting that wheat bel <dig> homologs may be associated with ovule development. bel <dig> acts to specify integument identity by controlling ag activity  <cit> . bel <dig> encodes a tale homeodomain transcription factor distantly related to the pbx family  <cit> . plant bel1-like homeobox  genes form a small gene family functioning in various developmental aspects such as seed shattering in rice  <cit>  and leaf shape establishment in arabidopsis  <cit> . for many of the blh functions, molecular interaction with knotted1-type homeodomain  proteins is required. barley jubel <dig> and jubel <dig> were originally isolated as interaction partners of the knox protein bkn <dig>  <cit> . arabidopsis bellringer  functions with knox genes in early patterning of inflorescence architecture and in maintenance of the inflorescence meristem  <cit> . the bel domain of blh directly interacts with the meinox domain of knox, and the interaction is evolutionarily conserved between animals and plants  <cit> .

to elucidate molecular mechanisms of the abnormal ovule development in alloplasmic wheat with ae. crassa cytoplasm, we first isolated wheat cdna clones for the blh homologs, and then studied their differential expression patterns and interaction with wheat knox proteins. association of the blh homologs with pistillody and female sterility in -csdt7bs is discussed based on the results.

methods
plant materials
three common wheat  cultivars, chinese spring , norin <dig>  and norin <dig> , and a ditelosomic 7bs line of cs  were used in this study. euplasmic lines of each with their intrinsic cytoplasm develop normal fertile reproductive organs. alloplasmic lines with the cytoplasm of a wild relative, aegilops crassa, used in the study were respectively abbreviated as -cs, -n <dig>  -n <dig> and -csdt7bs. the -n <dig> shows pistillody when grown under long-day conditions , and exhibits partial pistillody under short-day conditions, implying that n <dig> might contain a fertility restorer  gene functioning under short-day conditions   <cit> . both -cs and -n <dig> show normal male fertility because of their possession of rf gene against the ae. crassa cytoplasm in their nuclear genome   <cit> . cs has a single dominant rf gene, rfd <dig>  on the long arm of chromosome 7b  and n <dig> has multiple rf genes. a cs monotelodisomic line of chromosome 7bs with the ae. crassa cytoplasm  is hemizygous for rfd <dig> and partially fertile . -csdt7bs, which was generated from a cross of -csmt7bs with csdt7bs, shows not only pistillody but also female sterility, independently of day length   <cit> . an fr mutant of -n <dig> obtained after ems mutagenesis of -n <dig> shows no pistillody even under long-day conditions   <cit> , and was used in the expression analysis.

three accessions of ancestral diploid species, triticum urartu , aegilops speltoides  and aegilops tauschii , and the tetraploid wheat  cultivar langdon were used in dna gel blot analysis. a nulli-tetrasomic series of cs produced by sears  <cit>  was used for chromosome assignment of the isolated wheat cdnas. each line of the nulli-tetrasomic series lacks a given pair of homoeologous a, b or d genome chromosomes  that have been replaced by the corresponding homoeologous chromosome pair .

cloning and sequencing of wheat bell <dig> homologs
degenerate primers, 5'-cgacacttcctcacccgt-3' and 5'-accgcgttgataacca-3', were designed and used for amplification of the bel domain regions in rna from pistils of cs and -csdt7bs. the reverse transcription -pcr products were cloned into the pgem-t easy vector  and nucleotide sequences were determined by an automated fluorescent dyedeoxy terminator cycle sequencing system using an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer . nucleotide sequences of the isolated cdna fragments were analyzed by dnasis software  and the sequence was searched for homology using the blast algorithm  <cit> .

the cdna fragments were used to search wheat expression sequence tag  clones, and the identified est clone talr1107f03r contained the complete open reading frame . to identify other blh cdna clones, first-strand cdna was synthesized using total rna from pistils of cs and -csdt7bs, and 5' and 3' race-pcr was performed with a smart-race pcr kit  according to the manufacturer's procedure. gene-specific primers for race-pcr were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of the degenerate primer-amplified rt-pcr products. for 5' and 3' race-pcr, the following primers were respectively used: 5'-tcctcgccgccagcatgtccttctcgt-3' and 5'-aagtccgtcgccgtgctcaaagcctgg-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-tttgagacctgattcctcgttaagcctg-3' and 5'-cagcaaggtggccgccgggaaagacag-3' for wblh <dig>  and 5'-ggccagcatttgcttgtcgccatcggta-3' and 5'-gcgcaacaccagcaagatgccggtcaa-3' for wblh <dig>  a cdna fragment containing the complete orf was amplified with the following primer sets: 5'-ccgacgacgacgatgatgac-3' and 5'-ccttagcccccccaagaata-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-cggtgctttctctctccatg-3' and 5'-ttcctagccgacgacgtctt-3' for wblh <dig>  and 5'-cctccctctctctccccctt-3' and 5'-tgatcccagcaatggagcaa-3' for wblh <dig>  the nucleotide sequences of the isolated cdna clones were analyzed as mentioned above, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by genetyx-mac version  <dig>  software  based on nei's genetic distance. the phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  method  <cit> .

southern blot and rt-pcr analyses
for genomic southern blot analysis, total dna extracted from cs, langdon and diploid wheat was digested with the restriction enzyme hindiii. total dna extracted from the nulli-tetrasomics was also digested with hindiii, drai and bamhi. the digested dna was fractionated by electrophoresis through a  <dig> % agarose gel, transferred to hybond n+ nylon membrane  and hybridized with 32p-labeled partial blh cdna fragments as a probe . probe labeling, hybridization, washing and autoradiography were performed according to takumi et al.  <cit> .

total rna was extracted by guanidine thiocyanate from various tissues at the vegetative and reproductive phases in the euplasmic and alloplasmic wheat lines. accumulation of the four blh and three knox transcripts was detected by rt-pcr amplification as previously reported  <cit> . rt-pcr was conducted with the following gene-specific primer sets: 5'-tcaaccgacagcagcagcag-3' and 5'-ccgaaccccatcaccgagtc-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-gtgcccagtcttcctcggtc-3' and 5'-tccatccacctcccgccgtc-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-cgctgtcctcgtcctcctcg-3' and 5'-ggagagcgatggaggcaaag-3' for wblh <dig>  and 5'-ccctctcctccgcctcgtcc-3' and 5'-cggggcggcgttgctgaacc-3' for wblh <dig>  primers for amplification of wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig>  transcripts are described in our previous studies  <cit> . the ubiquitin  and actin  genes were used as internal controls  <cit> . the pcr-amplified products were separated by electrophoresis through a  <dig> % agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. rt-pcr analysis was performed at the exponential range of amplification, and the entire experiment was conducted twice. two technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate.

quantitative rt-pcr was performed using a takara thermal cycler dice real time system  and gene-specific primer sets. as an endogenous control, the wheat act gene was used. the rate of amplification was monitored using thunderbird sybr ppcr mix  according to the manufacturer's protocol. results were obtained as 2-Δct values, where ct is the number of pcr cycles required to reach the log phase of amplification for the examined genes minus the same measure for act, and were represented as values relative to the transcript levels in pistils of cs, n <dig> or csdt7bs.

mrna in situ hybridization
pistils and young spikes at the stage of floral organ development in the lines csdt7bs and -csdt7bs were fixed in  <dig> % p-formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid at 4°c overnight. the fixed tissues were embedded in paraplast medium  after dehydration with ethanol and infiltration with xylene. the embedded samples were sliced into 8-μm sections and dried overnight onto slides coated with vectabond reagent . tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through an ethanol series, then dehydrated through an ethanol series after treatment with proteinase k and triethanolamine. hybridization of the four blh mrnas with digoxigenin-labeled probe produced from the coding regions was performed overnight at 52°c. the rna probes were directly synthesized with t <dig> and t <dig> rna polymerase  from the isolated cdna clone. after hybridization, the sections were washed and treated with rnase. immunological detection of the hybridized probe was according to morimoto et al. <cit> .

yeast two-hybrid assay
a hybrizap- <dig>  two-hybrid undigested vector kit  was used to study protein-protein interaction between blh and knox. the entire orf sequences of wheat blh and knox cdna fragments were amplified with the following primer sets containing either an ecori, bamhi, sali or xbai linker: 5'-ccgaattcatgggaatagcggcgccacc-3' and 5'-ccgtcgactcaacaaccattgtagtctc-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-ggggatccatgtctagcaatccatccta-3' and 5'-ggtctagattcctagccgacgacgtctt-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-ggggatccgccgccgccatgtcatcgg-3' and 5'-ggggatccgtcgacgatcacccaacgagtcat-3' for wblh <dig>  5'-ccgaattcatggaggagatcggccacca-3' and 5'-cccccgggctagccgaacctgtagagcc-3' for wknox <dig>  5'-gggaattcatggagaagttccctaat-3' and 5'-gggtcgactggagaaagggagagagg-3' for wrs <dig>  and 5'-gggaattcatggaggatctgtacagca-3' and 5'-gggtcgacagcaatcatccatccatct-3' for wlg <dig>  the pcr products were digested with ecori and sali and cloned into the ecori/sali sites of pad-gal4- <dig>  and pbd-gal <dig> cam vectors, resulting in pad-wblh <dig>  pad-wblh <dig>  pad-wblh <dig>  pbd-wknox <dig>  pbd-wrs <dig>  pbd-wlg <dig> and pbd-wblh <dig>  deletion derivatives of pad-wblh <dig>  pad-wblh <dig> and pbd-wblh <dig> were generated using internal restriction enzyme recognition sites and internal primers with the linker sequence. pad-wt and pbd-wt, containing the wild-type fragment c of lambda ci, were used as controls according to the manufacturer's protocol . these pad and pbd constructs were introduced into yeast strain yrg- <dig> . the interaction was assessed on sd medium  without leucine , tryptophan  or histidine  and containing  <dig> mm 3-amino- <dig> ,4-triazole.

RESULTS
cloning of wheat bell1-like homeobox genes
the cs line ditelosomic 7bs lacking rfd <dig> with normal cytoplasm  forms normal stamens, whereas the alloplasmic line of csdt7bs with ae. crassa cytoplasm -csdt7bs) showed pistillody in all florets . to identify wheat blh homologs associated with pistillody, we designed degenerate primers based on the nucleotide sequences of rice and barley blh homologs, and amplified the 108-bp regions encoding the conserved bell1-type homeodomains using total rna from pistils of cs and -csdt7bs. in total,  <dig> of the rt-pcr products were sequenced and classified into seven groups based on their nucleotide sequences , indicating that at least seven members of the blh gene family were identified in the wheat genome. four of the identified blh members, groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  appeared favored by either cs or -csdt7bs.

in the wheat est database of the cereal research centre, agriculture and agri-food canada, one est clone showed high homology to barley jubel <dig>  <cit> , and the cdna clone talr1107f03r contained an entire orf. the wheat jubel <dig> homolog corresponding to the group  <dig> rt-pcr products was named wblh <dig>  two additional cdna sequences for wblh <dig> were isolated from cs. the three wblh <dig> cdnas contained single orfs encoding  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, and were respectively designated wblh1- <dig>  wblh1- <dig>  and wblh1- <dig>  to isolate full-length cdna clones for the group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rt-pcr products, 5'- and 3'-race-pcr were conducted with gene-specific primers designed for the homeobox regions. based on the nucleotide sequences of the race-pcr products, three cdna-specific primer sets were designed, and the cdna clones identified were named wblh <dig>  wblh <dig> and wblh <dig>  a wblh <dig> cdna clone encoding  <dig> amino acid residues was obtained, and the cdna sequence included an 18-bp deletion in the orf compared with the race-pcr product. the wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> cdna clones contained an entire orf encoding  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the isolated cdna sequences were deposited in the ddbj database under the accession numbers ab546641-ab <dig> 

putative amino acid sequences of the four wheat blh proteins contained three conserved domains, sky, bel and homeodomains . based on the homeodomain sequences of four wblh and related proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed . the amino acid sequence of wblh1- <dig> showed the highest similarity  to that of barley jubel <dig>  and jubel <dig> was closely related  to wblh <dig>  wblh <dig> showed high similarity to rice qsh <dig>  a major quantitative trait locus controlling seed shattering through formation of an abscission layer  <cit> . the homeodomain of wblh <dig> was highly similar to that of arabidopsis light-induced ath <dig>  <cit>  and distantly divergent from other bel1-related proteins. in all three conserved domains, wblh <dig> showed the highest similarity to arabidopsis bel <dig> of the four wblh proteins. among these wblh proteins, homeodomain sequences were highly conserved, while the sky and bel domains were relatively more diverged . in particular, the sky and bel domains of wblh <dig> were distinct from those of the other three wblh proteins.

to study the copy number of wblh <dig> in the wheat genome, southern blots were analyzed using total dna isolated from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. southern blots using the shorter cdna fragment as a probe  showed low copy numbers of wblh <dig> in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genomes, and a single major and a few minor bands for wblh <dig> in the a, s and d diploid genomes . to assign the wblh <dig> homologous loci to wheat chromosomes, aneuploid analysis was performed using a series of nulli-tetrasomic lines. southern blots using the longer cdna fragment as a probe  showed that wblh1-homologous bands could be assigned to chromosomes 2b, 4a, 4d, 5a, 5b and 5d , meaning that the three isolated wblh <dig> cdnas were not necessarily homoeologous. two major bands of wblh <dig> were observed in the a, s and d diploid genomes , and the wblh2-specific bands were absent only in the nulli-tetrasomic lines of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes and chromosomes 1a, 2a and 2d . wblh <dig> and its homologous loci were assigned to the six chromosomes in common wheat. similarly, a single major band for wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> was detected in the a, s and d diploid genomes . the wblh3- and wblh4-specific bands were absent in the nulli-tetrasomic lines of homoeologous group  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes, respectively . these southern bots indicated that wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> respectively represented three homoeologous loci of group  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes in common wheat.

expression patterns of the four wblh genes revealed by rt-pcr analyses
to study expression patterns of the four wblh genes in wheat, rt-pcr analysis was conducting using total rna from various tissues of cs. single bands were clearly visualized for the four wblh genes, although the gene-specific primers did not distinguish the three a, b, and d homoeoalleles of the target genes. the four wheat blh genes showed tissue-specific expression patterns . wblh <dig> transcripts accumulated predominantly in floral organs than in vegetative organs, suggesting that these genes play important roles in wheat reproductive organ development. wblh <dig> transcripts were detected in shoot and inflorescence meristem-containing tissues, and in floral organs. wblh <dig> expression was observed in most tissues examined, and the expression pattern of wblh <dig> closely resembled that of wblh <dig> 

next, to compare expression patterns of the four wblh genes in wheat florets, semi-quantitative and quantitative rt-pcr analyses were conducted using total rna isolated from floral organs of various alloplasmic wheat lines with ae. crassa cytoplasm. wblh <dig> transcripts were more abundantly accumulated in stamens than in pistils and lodicules of cs, and were observed at a low level in leaves of cs seedlings . similarly, abundant accumulation of wblh <dig> transcripts was observed in partially transformed stamens of -csmt7bs, but no significant difference in the wblh <dig> transcript level was observed between stamens of -cs and the partially transformed stamens of -csmt7bs . in transformed stamens of -csdt7bs, the transcript level was similar to that in the pistils of both euplasmic and alloplasmic cs lines. to confirm abundant expression in stamens, wblh <dig> expression was also analyzed using the other series of euplasmic and alloplasmic wheat lines. the wblh <dig> transcripts similarly accumulated in stamens of all the lines examined . in partially transformed stamens of -n <dig>  the wblh <dig> transcript level was significantly reduced compared with euplasmic n <dig> .

abundant accumulation of wblh <dig> transcripts was observed in pistils and lodicules, with no transcript detected in leaves and roots of cs . the abundant expression of wblh <dig> in pistils was also observed in the other euplasmic and alloplasmic lines. the wblh <dig> transcript levels in transformed stamens of -csdt7bs and partially transformed stamens of -csmt7bs and -n <dig> were significantly reduced compared with those in pistils, whereas transformed stamens of -csdt7bs had an increased wblh <dig> transcript level compared with normal stamens of csdt7bs . the wblh <dig> transcripts in the partially transformed stamens of -csmt7bs and -n <dig> accumulated at lower levels than those of fully transformed stamens.

wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> transcripts more abundantly accumulated in pistils and lodicules compared with stamens of cs . wblh <dig> expression was also detected in leaves and roots. wblh <dig> transcript levels were more abundant in the lodicules than in the pistils. in pistils of the other euplasmic and alloplasmic lines, predominant expression of wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> was clearly observed. the wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> transcript levels in transformed stamens of -csdt7bs were similar to those in pistils.

wknox <dig> is an ortholog of the maize kn <dig> homeobox gene functioning mainly in shoot, inflorescence and floral meristem  <cit> . wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> are wheat orthologs of maize rough sheath <dig>  and liguleless <dig>  knox genes, respectively  <cit> . maize rs <dig> and lg <dig> belong to the class i knox gene family and play important roles in maintenance of shoot apical meristem  indeterminancy and differentiation of lateral organs  <cit> . transcripts of wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> accumulated abundantly in sam-containing embryos and young spikes and in floral organs, but not in fully developed leaf blades . accumulation of wknox <dig> transcript was observed in pistils and lodicules of cs . low levels of wknox <dig> transcripts were detected in stamens of euplasmic and alloplasmic lines of cs, whereas slight wknox <dig> transcript accumulated in partially transformed stamens of -csmt7bs. wknox <dig> transcripts accumulated abundantly in transformed stamens of -csdt7bs, and the accumulation level was similar to that in pistils. abundant expression of wknox <dig> in pistils was also observed in the other euplasmic and alloplasmic lines.

in situ localization of the four wblh transcripts in pistils
fully developed ovules in normal pistils are surrounded by the inner and outer integuments, all enveloped by an inner epidermis   <cit> . to compare the expression patterns of the four wblh genes in pistil development of common wheat in detail, in situ hybridization analysis was conducted using pistils and young spikes at the floral organ developing stage, in which stamen and pistil primordia develop. in transverse sections of pistils from cs and csdt7bs, accumulation of wblh <dig> transcript was found in the ovary, but not the ovule . in both pistils and transformed stamens of -csdt7bs, wblh <dig> transcripts were localized to the ovary but not the ovule. no significant differences in wblh <dig> localization were observed among fertile pistils, sterile pistils, and transformed stamens. wblh <dig> transcripts were also found in longitudinal sections of anthers, especially in tapetum and anther epidermis of cs .

wblh <dig> transcripts highly accumulated at the stage of floral organ development in the ovule of the cs, csdt7bs and -csdt7bs pistils . wblh <dig> mrna was present at higher levels in the inner integument than in the outer integument and nucellus of the pistils. no significant difference in wblh <dig> mrna localization was observed between fertile and sterile pistils. even in ectopic ovules of the transformed stamens, wblh <dig> transcripts highly accumulated, although the integument developed incompletely.

in longitudinal sections of young spikes at the floral organ developing stage from csdt7bs, wblh <dig> mrna was detected in the anther walls of the stamen and the basal region of the carpel but not in the ovule . wblh <dig> transcripts accumulated in the central region of the transformed stamens of -csdt7bs, where the ectopic ovule was presumed to develop. similar expression patterns were observed for wblh <dig> .

protein-protein interaction between wheat blh and knox
protein-protein interactions between blh and knox were previously reported in arabidopsis and barley  <cit> . the blh-knox heterodimers play important roles in plant development  <cit> . to confirm the interactions between wheat blh and knox proteins, a yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted. entire orf sequences of wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> were fused to the nucleotide sequence for the yeast gal <dig> dna binding domain , and the wblh <dig>  wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> orfs were fused to the sequence for the yeast gal <dig> transcriptional activation domain . the yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that wblh <dig> interacts with wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> . wblh <dig> also showed interaction with the three wheat knox proteins. wblh <dig>  however, formed a complex with wknox <dig> and wrs <dig>  but not with wlg <dig> 

to determine the knox-interacting domain of wheat blh proteins, deletion-mutant constructs of wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> were produced, and protein-protein interaction of the wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> deletion proteins with wknox <dig> and wlg <dig> was examined by yeast two-hybrid assay . nowblh <dig> deletion construct lacking the bel domain showed positive interaction with wknox <dig> and wlg <dig> . neither deletion in the sky domain nor the homeodomain of wblh <dig> had any effect on protein-protein interactions with the two knox proteins. the n-terminal region of wblh <dig> was also not required for the interactions. arabidopsis bel <dig> interacts with knox proteins through the n-terminal to homeodomain regions  <cit> . the interaction domain with knox was more restricted in wblh <dig> than in bel <dig>  similarly, deletions in the sky and bel domain region of wblh <dig> abolished the interaction with wknox <dig>  and a wblh <dig> deletion without the homeodomain had no influence on the interaction . deletion analysis of wblh <dig> indicated that the region from the sky domain to the bel domain was required for the interaction with wknox <dig>  in addition, no deletion derivatives of wblh <dig> showed positive interactions with wlg <dig>  meaning the absence of any region inhibiting the interaction with wlg <dig> in wblh <dig> 

the entire orf of wblh <dig> was fused to the nucleotide sequence for the yeast gal <dig> dna binding domain. yeast transformants carrying the bd-wblh <dig> construct survived on his- selection medium, indicating that wblh <dig> could activate transcription of the reporter gene used in yeast. to identify the activation-related domain, deletion derivatives of wblh <dig> fused to the dna binding domain were introduced, and transformants were recovered on his- selection medium. no wblh <dig> constructs lacking either the sky, bel or homeodomains lost function as a transcriptional activator . deletion of the n-terminal region failed to activate reporter gene expression. these results revealed that the n-terminal region  was essential for transcriptional activation.

discussion
wblh <dig> function is distinct from those of other three blh genes
bell1-type homeobox genes play important roles in plant development. in this study, four wheat blh genes were isolated and named wblh <dig> to wblh <dig>  wblh <dig>  a putative ortholog of barley jubel <dig>  <cit> , was highly similar to arabidopsis sawtooth <dig>  and sawtooth <dig> , which act redundantly to suppress expression of the knox gene brevipedicellus  in leaf margins  <cit> . saw <dig> and saw <dig> expression was also observed in lateral organs including the adaxial side of developing sepals but not in developing ovules, and therefore saw <dig> and saw <dig> are unlikely to be redundant with bel <dig> function in ovule development, although the two genes are the most closely related in sequence to bel <dig>  <cit> . wblh <dig> was expressed in the ovary but not the ovule , indicating that wblh <dig> function also does not correspond to that of bel <dig> 

both bel <dig> and saw <dig> are able to interact with class i knox proteins, stm, bp and knat <dig>  and with the class ii knox protein knat <dig>  but not with other class ii knox proteins, knat <dig>  knat <dig> and knat <dig>  <cit> . the class i knox genes are considered to play a role in establishment and maintenance of meristematic identity and in the initiation of lateral organ primordia, and their expression patterns were temporally and spatially regulated, whereas expression of the class ii knox genes is constitutive  <cit> . similarly, wblh <dig> could interact with three class i knox proteins, wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> . wknox <dig>  wrs <dig> and wlg <dig> are related to knat <dig>  bp and knat <dig>  respectively  <cit> . barley jubel <dig> also interacts with class i knox proteins bkn <dig> and bkn <dig>  but not with class ii knox protein bkn <dig>  <cit> . the interacting domain of wblh <dig> could be defined to the bel domain in this study , which was included in the interacting region of jubel <dig>  <cit> . these results imply evolutionary conservation of the protein-protein interaction between the class i knox proteins and wblh1-related proteins since the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. in animals, interaction between two types of tale-homeobox protein families plays important roles in development, and an n-terminal portion of the pbx subclass proteins is essential for heterodimerization with the meinox subclass proteins  <cit> . the meinox-pbx complex in animals is evolutionarily conserved as the knox-blh complex in plants  <cit> . knox-blh interaction likely alters intracellular localization of the knox transcription factor  <cit> , and the kn1-blh complex binds to the specific dna motif, tgacagt, with higher affinity compared with kn <dig> alone  <cit> . these observations surely indicate the significance of knox-blh complex formation in various plant developmental processes.

wblh <dig> also interacted with the three class i knox proteins . wblh <dig> was phylogenetically close to wblh <dig>  a putative ortholog of barley jubel <dig>  <cit> , although the chromosomal locations of wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> were different. rt-pcr and in situ mrna hybridization analyses revealed that the gene expression profile of wblh <dig> was generally identical to that of wblh <dig>  wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> were homologous to arabidopsis blh <dig> . wblh <dig> and wblh <dig> expression was observed in the basal region of the carpel but not the ovule . similarly, arabidopsis blh <dig> expression is restricted to the transmitting tract and the base of the funiculus, but is not observed in the ovule or embryo sac  <cit> . therefore, the wblh3/ <dig> expression patterns were well conserved with that of blh <dig>  misexpression of blh <dig> affects normal embryo sac development in ovules of the arabidopsis eostre mutant  <cit> . a mutation of the class ii knox gene knat <dig> suppresses the eostre mutant phenotype  <cit> , and knat <dig> is able to interact with blh <dig>  <cit> . hackbusch et al.  <cit>  and pagnussat et al.  <cit>  also reported that the function of the arabidopsis knox-blh complexes requires the ovate family proteins. no misexpression of wblh3/ <dig> was observed in ovules of the euplasmic and alloplasmic wheat lines, and therefore we have no information about functional orthology between blh <dig> and wblh3/ <dig>  wblh <dig> displays similarity to the rice qsh <dig> homeobox protein, a putative ortholog of the arabidopsis replumless  homeobox protein  <cit> . rpl and qsh <dig> are associated with seed shattering. rpl is expressed in arabidopsis stem, pedicels and replum of developing ovaries, and qsh <dig> is expressed in rice inflorescence meristem, anther and the boundary of the spikelets. wblh <dig> might function to define the boundary regions as do rpl and qsh <dig> 

wblh <dig>  closely related to the arabidopsis ath <dig> homeobox gene, was phylogenetically distinct from other wheat blh genes . ath <dig> was originally isolated as a light-induced homeobox gene  <cit> . ath <dig> is expressed in shoot, inflorescence and floral meristems, developing stamens and carpels, and basal regions of lateral organs including leaves, sepals and petals  <cit> . the mutant phenotype of ath <dig> indicates that ath <dig> controls the development of the boundary region between shoot lateral organs and the stem  <cit> . the ath1-stm complex is associated with initiation and maintenance of arabidopsis sam  <cit> . aht <dig> expression in stamens and carpels is consistent with the activation of ath <dig> by agamous  <cit> . in contrast to the ath <dig> expression pattern, wblh <dig> was abundantly expressed in ovules but not in ligule or auricle regions . the wblh <dig> expression pattern is likely to be analogous to that of bel <dig> rather than ath <dig>  especially in integuments of ovules, wblh <dig> transcripts accumulated abundantly, indicating that wblh <dig> might be associated with development of integuments in wheat. the ovule-specific expression of wblh <dig> clearly differed from the expression patterns of three other wheat blh genes. in addition, of the class i knox proteins examined, wblh <dig> was not able to interact with wlg <dig> . the interacting region of wblh <dig> with wknox <dig> was defined from the sky domain to the bel domain, which was broader than the interacting region of wblh <dig> with wknox <dig> and wlg <dig> . these observations reveal that the functional features of wblh <dig> are distinct from those of the other blh gene functions in wheat development. in particular, the role of wblh <dig> in ovule development should be elucidated in further studies.

altered expression of bel1-type homeobox genes in floral organs of alloplasmic lines
pistillody is one of the typical phenomena appearing in nuclear-cytoplasm incompatibility of higher plants. for expression of pistillody, the expression patterns of a large number of nuclear genes including class b mads-box genes are altered  <cit> . the downregulation of the class b mads-box genes in stamen primordia results in homeotic conversion at floral whorl three in the pistillody-showing alloplasmic lines as well as loss-of-function mutants of the class b mads-box genes. within their pistil-like stamens, ectopic ovules are surely formed as reported in arabidopsis, rice and alloplasmic wheat  <cit> . our previous studies revealed that wheat class b mads-box genes wpi <dig>  wpi <dig> and wap <dig> are downregulated at floral whorl three in alloplasmic wheat lines showing pistillody  <cit> , whereas two class c mads-box genes, wag- <dig> and wag- <dig>  and tadl, an ortholog of rice drooping leaf , are ectopically expressed in primordia of the pistil-like transformed stamens  <cit> . after floral organ identity is homeotically changed at whorl three, ovule formation is likely to automatically occur within the transformed stamens through expression of the class d mads-box gene taagl2/wstk  <cit> . during ectopic ovule development, expression of wbsis and want- <dig> is observed in integuments of the ovules  <cit> . wblh <dig> was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils but also of ectopic ovules in transformed stamens . wblh1/wblh3/wblh <dig> expression was observed in the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens. these observations suggest that expression of the four wblh genes is associated with development of transformed stamens in alloplasmic wheat lines with ae. crassa cytoplasm.

ectopic ovules in transformed stamens and ovules in pistils of -csdt7bs are sterile due to abnormal development of the inner epidermis and integuments  <cit> . it was thought that aberrant expression of wbsis and a reduced transcript level of want- <dig> might at least partially result in the sterility of the ovules and ectopic ovules  <cit>  . such an obvious alteration of gene expression in the ovules and ectopic ovules was not observed in wblh <dig>  the wblh <dig> expression pattern in the sterile pistils seemed to be identical to that in normal ovules of fertile pistils . therefore, we have no evidence for wblh <dig> being associated with the female sterility of the transformed stamens and pistils in -csdt7bs. the regulatory pathway of wblh <dig> expression in ovule development might be independent of those of wbsis and want- <dig>  after wag- <dig> and wag- <dig> expression in the transformed stamens and sterile pistils, wstk initiates ovule development  <cit> . wblh <dig> expression occurs continuously in the developing ovules of the transformed stamens and sterile pistils, whereas wbsis is ectopically expressed in the marginal region of ovule primordia and want- <dig> expression level is reduced around ovule primordia  <cit>  . after ovule initiation via wstk, some of the ovule development-related genes such as wbsis and want- <dig> should be abnormally expressed, which in turn might be associated with the aberrant ovule development. in further studies, signal cascades from initiation of ovule primordia to wbsis/want- <dig> or wblh <dig> expression should be elucidated to investigate how the ae. crassa cytoplasm and rfd <dig> affect female sterility in the pistillody-exhibiting alloplasmic wheat lines.

CONCLUSIONS
wheat blh genes consist of a small multigene family. four wheat bell1-like homeobox  genes, wblh <dig> to wblh <dig>  were isolated in this study. a yeast two-hybrid assay showed that knox-blh interaction was conserved in wheat similarly to in various other plant species, indicating the significance of knox-blh complex formation in wheat developments. of the class i knox proteins examined, wblh <dig> was unable to interact with wlg <dig>  the interacting region of wblh <dig> with wknox <dig> was defined from the sky domain to the bel domain, which was broader than the interacting region of wblh <dig> with wknox <dig> and wlg <dig>  in addition, the ovule-specific expression of wblh <dig> clearly differed from the expression patterns of three other wheat blh genes. therefore, the functional features of wblh <dig> are likely to be distinct from other blh gene functions in wheat development. wblh <dig> was also strongly expressed in integuments not only of normal ovules in pistils but also of ectopic ovules in transformed stamens. wblh1/wblh3/wblh <dig> expression was observed in the basal boundary region of the ovary in both normal pistils and transformed stamens. these results indicated that the four wblh genes may participate in development of pistils and transformed stamens but are not associated with female sterility in alloplasmic wheat lines with ae. crassa cytoplasm.
