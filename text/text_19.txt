BACKGROUND
akirin is a recently discovered protein with an essential function in the drosophila melanogaster immune deficiency  pathway, which responds to gram-negative bacterial infection  <cit> . akirin was strictly localised to the nucleus and acted in concert with relish  to induce the expression of a subset of downstream pathway components  <cit> . the knockdown of the fly akirin gene caused a lethal embryonic phenotype  <cit> . akirin is conserved in vertebrates as at least two genes that were named akirin <dig> and akirin <dig>  <cit> . in mice, akirin <dig> functions in the toll-like receptor , tumour necrosis factor  and interleukin -1β signalling pathways, again at the level of/downstream of nf-kb to induce the transcription of several immune-response genes including the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- <dig>   <cit> . the knockout of the individual mammalian akirin copies produced distinct phenotypes; whereas akirin1-/- mice had no obvious phenotype, ablation of the akirin <dig> gene was embryonic-lethal  <cit> . thus, seemingly, the role of invertebrate akirin in embryonic development and the innate immune response is most strongly conserved in akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> may have diverged in function  <cit> . while it is clear that vertebrate akirin  <dig> and  <dig> are closely related, it is unknown whether they form part of a larger gene family related by gene duplication. further, the exact origin and evolutionary relationships of akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> are not established.

in this paper we provide a detailed examination of the evolution of the akirin gene family in eukaryotes. using an exhaustive computational screen including non-model species, we show that a single akirin proto-orthologue is highly conserved across invertebrate metazoans in terms of genomic organisation and coding features and identify orthologues in several more basal eukaryotes. robust phylogenetic analysis revealed that akirin duplicated in a common chordate ancestor before the separation of jawed and jawless vertebrate lineages. we show that akirin genes have been characterised independently on several occasions, and suggest that a single, simple nomenclature system is employed in future studies. by bringing together the available akirin literature and examining the divergent molecular evolution of akirin <dig> and  <dig> coding sequences, we provide significant insight into the multiple functions of this small gene family. a common feature of akirins is to regulate gene transcription in several characterised signalling pathways, seemingly through interactions with intermediary factors such as 14-3- <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
akirin nomenclature
future studies of akirin genes would benefit from a common nomenclature system to aid the dissemination of results between different research groups. of the current names utilised, we suggest that the naming system employed by goto et al.  <cit>  is used in future submissions, since it is derived from the most detailed functional analysis and suitably describes the evolutionary relationships of different orthologues and paralogues. the designation 'fbi1'  <cit>   is also founded on important functional data, but is very similar to a gene named factor binding ist protein  <dig>  and as with the name 'mighty'  <cit>  , does not account for evolutionary relationships within the gene family.

the origin of akirin predates the metazoan lineage
an akirin proto-orthologue was not identified in the bacterial or archeal genomes examined, which either excludes a prokaryotic origin, or means that insufficient phylogenetic signal remains to identify these ancient orthologues. the earliest eukaryotes in which an akirin gene was retrieved were the protist taxa alveolata  and heterolobosea  . the alveolata and the euglenozoa  are thought to have arisen close to  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . this places an origin for akirin prior to the split of animal/plant/fungi lineages. however, an akirin gene was not identified in any plant or fungal genome as previously noted  <cit> , although it was represented in the amoebozoa  and the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis , which branches as the closest known outgroup to metazoans  <cit> . the presence of an akirin gene was an exception rather than a rule in non-animal eukaryotic genomes. this is consistent with the independent non-functionalization of akirin in many eukaryotic lineages, before it obtained a fundamental function in the metazoans.

genomic organisation of eukaryotic akirins
in d. discoideum and n. gruberi, akirin comprises a single exon, whereas m. brevicollis has conserved a 3-exon gene . choanoflagellates are the closest known living relatives to metazoans and its genes are comparably rich in intronic sequences  <cit> . thus, relative to these more basal eukaryotes, it might be expected that certain features of the m. brevicollis akirin proto-orthologue would be conserved with animal akirins. while the two exon-exon boundaries of the choanoflagellate gene are not conserved with any metazoans , a string of  <dig> codons   <dig> nucleotides into the second exon code the signature residues met-ala-cys-ala, conserved at the start region of all invertebrate metazoan akirins . additionally, in close downstream proximity to this motif, a nuclear localization signal   is present , which is conserved in metazoan sequences. these findings suggest that the metazoan akirin1/ <dig> coding sequence was derived from exons  <dig> and  <dig> of a single gene in a common ancestor to metazoans and choanoflagellates.

a comparison of the genomic organisation of metazoan akirins provides insight into their evolutionary heritage . in all vertebrate species examined , akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> are organized as  <dig> exons of comparable size and  <dig> more variable introns . in cephalochordates , akirin also comprises  <dig> exons, although exon  <dig> is made up solely of untranslated nucleotides . in fact, exon  <dig> of the b. floridae gene is equivalent to exon  <dig> of vertebrates  and the addition of exon  <dig> was probably a lineage specific acquisition. in placozoans , akirin comprises  <dig> exons . in cnidarians , which represent a basal metazoan lineage that branched later than placozoans  <cit> , akirin comprises  <dig> exons. the boundary of exons 1/ <dig> of placozoan akirin is conserved with the boundary of exons 1/ <dig> in all other metazoans examined . further, the boundary of exons 2/ <dig> of placozoan akirin is conserved with the boundaries of exons 2/ <dig> in sea anemone/amphioxus and exons 3/ <dig> in vertebrates . additionally, the boundary of exons 2/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> of the amphioxus/sea anemone genes are respectively conserved with the boundary of exons 3/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> in vertebrate akirin1/ <dig> . the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario to account for these distributions of conserved exon-exon boundaries is that firstly, an exon-gain event occurred in the akirin gene after the split of placozoans with a common ancestor to cnidarians and bilatarians . in support of this, exon  <dig> of the anemone/amphioxus proto-orthologue and vertebrate akirin1/ <dig> genes starts with the last three residues of the protein , which are conserved in all animals examined except placozoans. subsequent to the proposed exon gain event, an intron was seemingly inserted into exon  <dig> of akirin in a common deuterostome ancestor, after the split of cephalochordates and higher chordates, but before the event separating akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> . we conclude that strong stabilising pressures have been enforced throughout metazoan evolution to maintain the comparable genomic organisation of present-day akirin genes across diverse taxa, in support of ancient patterns of gene regulation.

metazoan akirin genes
we performed an exhaustive search for akirins in animal genomes and transcriptomes employing a broad taxonomic sampling strategy. these results are summarised in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  in virtually all diploid vertebrates examined, a single akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> gene was identified. almost without exception, both genes were strongly represented among est databases of model and non-model vertebrate species. in common with the gnathostomes , petromyzon marinus  had two sequences with marked identity to akirin . however, one was an est that could not be identified in the ensembl  <dig> x genome pre-assembly and was partial at the c-terminal. further, a single akirin orthologue was retrieved in the myxinid  lineage . in the model avian gallus gallus , no akirin <dig> orthologue was present in the current ensembl genome assembly. further, it was not represented among ~ <dig>  genbank g. gallus ests, despite the presence of multiple positive akirin <dig> hits. likewise, in other model birds including zebra finch  and turkey , no akirin <dig> orthologues were retrieved in est databases containing ~ <dig> / <dig>  respective sequences. thus the absence of akirin <dig> in the class aves reflects the genuine loss of a gene family member, rather than repeated artefacts of insufficient sequencing resolution. this is consistent with a recent finding showing that the number of gene family members common to tetrapods/teleosts is markedly reduced in the class aves  <cit> . interestingly, gene families, which, like akirins, had known roles in the immune system, were the most strongly affected  <cit> .

in many invertebrate metazoans, a single gene was retrieved that shared significant identity to fly akirin and vertebrate akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> across its entire length , but had no clear identity to other characterised or uncharacterised genes. this included several bilaterian lineages with a strong representation of deuterostome and protostome taxa, plus more ancient phyla including cnidarians and placozoans, among the most ancient known animals  <cit> . however, an orthologue was not retrieved in sponges. a notable invertebrate lineage lacking an akirin gene was the family cionidae, which has a completed high-resolution genome sequence and an abundance of est sequences. this is consistent with the observation that the compact genome of ciona intestinalis  has undergone significant gene loss compared to other deuterostomes  <cit> . however, another ascidian  has retained an akirin orthologue.

the akirin gene duplicated in a common chordate ancestor
since a single akirin sequence was invariably retrieved in invertebrate/non-metazoan eukaryotes and diploid vertebrates had no more than two akirin homologues, we hypothesised that akirin was an ancestral proto-orthologue that gave rise to two akirin paralogues in a common vertebrate ancestor. this was tested by phylogenetic analysis using vertebrate akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> amino acid sequences and the single sequence representing four invertebrate deuterostome lineages as outgroups. the sequence alignment is provided in additional file  <dig>  maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic analyses were initially performed . further, to test the robustness of the analysis to different methods of reconstruction, we also performed neighbour joining , minimum evolution  and maximum parsimony  analyses . additionally, a nj tree was constructed solely from unsaturated positions in the alignment  <cit> , to test the hypothesis that mutational saturation at certain sites might influence tree topology. very similar topologies were retrieved by all approaches  and a clear branching was apparent internal to invertebrate outgroups, separating akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> clades . in both akirin clades, vertebrate sequences branched according to established taxonomic relationships, including the expected split of the sarcopterygii and actinopterygii . the included lamprey sequence  branched as the most external node of the vertebrate akirin <dig> clade in all trees . the partial lamprey sequence that was not included in the phylogenetic analysis, shares higher sequence identity to akirin <dig> , than to akirin <dig>  and could represent a lamprey akirin <dig> orthologue. the single hagfish orthologue was not used in the final phylogenetic analysis, since in preliminary reconstructions, its position was unstable and it formed either a weakly supported branch as the most external node of the akirin <dig> clade or alternatively, branched with more basal invertebrate outgroups. taken together, these results indicate that akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> are indeed paralogues that arose by gene duplication in a common ancestor to the vertebrate lineage, prior to the separation of gnathostome and agnathan lineages.

conserved synteny between akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> containing chromosomal tracts
next, we examined the genomic neighbourhood surrounding akirin1/ <dig> in mammals, birds, amphibians and fishes . in all vertebrate genomes examined, akirin <dig> and akirin <dig>  when both present, were positioned on different chromosomes, except in mice, where they are located on different ends of chromosome  <dig>  separated by ~ <dig> mb. a comparison of genes in the neighbourhood of akirin <dig> and akirin <dig>  demonstrates a strong level of conserved synteny across vertebrate classes, with limited intra-chromosomal rearrangements and few inter-chromosomal rearrangements in tetrapod species with known karyotypes. in teleosts, two tracts were present with conserved synteny relative to single akirin1/akirin2-containing regions of tetrapods . consistent with blast homology screens , an akirin <dig> gene was absent from the g. gallus genome and gene order was disrupted around this region relative to mammalian and amphibian genomes examined . in summary, these results indicate that the chromosomal organisation of akirin-containing tracts of vertebrate genomes were conserved from a common ancestor prior to the speciation events separating the major vertebrate classes.

akirins and the teleost whole genome duplication event
a single akirin <dig> gene was identified in all teleost species examined, whereas two akirin <dig> copies were retrieved from acanthopterygian taxa i.e. pufferfishes, medaka, sticklebacks and sea bream. all methods of phylogenetic analysis separated teleost akirin <dig> sequences into two clades . the first was represented by one of the two sequences in species of the acanthopterygii and the single ostariophysi copy   the second clade was represented by the remaining akirin <dig> sequences of acanthopterygian species . thus, each tree branches prior to the split of acanthopterygian and ostariophysian samples, which indicates that this duplication event occurred in a common teleost ancestor rather than in the acanthopterygian lineage. however, statistical confidence in this branching was weak by all methods  excepting the bayesian analysis . bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was shown under certain conditions to produce an overestimate of branch confidence  <cit> . thus, we also sought evidence to either provide support or refute this branching topology, using comparisons of conserved genomic synteny. the synteny map indicates that an expansive genomic region containing akirin <dig> duplicated in a common ancestor to zebrafish and stickleback , since two orthologous chromosomal tracts exist in both species that retain common synteny to a single region in tetrapod genomes . specifically, tetrapod genes are present in teleosts as either single orthologues interspersed between the two tracts  or are present as duplicated co-orthologues on both regions  . a similar pattern of double conserved synteny is seen in teleosts relative to tetrapods on the akirin <dig> synteny map, although akirin <dig> is only retained on a single chromosome . these patterns of synteny may be the result of a genome tetraploidization event that occurred in a basal teleost ancestor after the split of the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii lineages  <cit> . however, this interpretation requires that one of the akirin <dig> paralogues from this event was non-functionalised either in a common teleost ancestor, or within individual lineages. furthermore, one of the akirin <dig> paralogues must have been non-functionalised in an ancestor to the ostariophysi lineage, since a single akirin <dig> gene is found in zebrafish and fathead minnow.

duplicated genes from teleost species are generally annotated as either gene-1/gene- <dig> or gene-a/gene-b according to the order of their discovery. however, this nomenclature system is rarely based on phylogenetic premises and generally does not accommodate paralogues from distinct duplication events in different teleost lineages. for certain genes where teleost duplicates have been retained from both the teleost wgd and more recent lineage specific events, appropriate nomenclature systems have been proposed to simplify confusing existing naming systems . due to the fact that akirins are uncharacterised in fishes, we have a rare opportunity to set out a logical nomenclature framework from the onset of their study. we recommend, as indicated in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  that teleost akirin <dig> paralogues derived from the teleost whole-genome duplication event  <cit>  are named as either akirin <dig> or akirin <dig>  paralogues of these genes from more recent duplication events in certain teleost lineages e.g. salmonids  <cit>  should be named akirin <dig> or akirin <dig>  similarly, if new teleost akirin <dig> paralogues are discovered in the future then an equivalent naming system should be employed.

phylogenetic analysis of gene families present on both akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> containing chromosomal tracts
if akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> arose from the duplication of a region of the genome in a common vertebrate ancestor , then other genes or gene families would have been duplicated at this time. several vertebrate gene families are located in syntenic chromosomal regions where different members are located proximally to both akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> or to tracts where copies of these genes have been lost . several form small gene families, with just two members in diploid vertebrates  and where one member is found on each chromosomal tract containing either akirin <dig> or akirin <dig>  for example, in several vertebrate classes, genes for rragc, nt5c1a, cnr <dig>  pnrc <dig>  hnrnp-r, and maneal are found in the akirin <dig> genomic neighbourhood and have a single putative paralogue on the akirin <dig> chromosomal tract  . comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions of these gene families were performed with amino acid alignments using nj, bayesian, ml and mp approaches . for  <dig> of these  <dig> gene families, a single putative orthologue was identified in c. intestinalis/b. floridae genomes and employed as an outgroup. for ras-related gtp-binding protein , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein , cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase  <dig>  and proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator  protein families, tree topologies were very similar by all methods of reconstruction . in each case the tree branched into two clades containing family member orthologues from different vertebrate classes, closely reflecting expected taxonomic relationships . each of these branching topologies is compatible with a duplication event at the base of the vertebrate lineage, as shown for akirins .

phylogenetic analysis of the cannabinoid receptor  family was sensitive to the reconstruction method and only the nj analysis split the tree into two clades of cnr <dig> and cnr <dig> orthologues . other methods strongly supported a single cnr <dig> clade, but did not resolve cnr <dig> sequences into a single clade, when teleost sequences were included . however, it is noteworthy that previous phylogenetic studies have suggested that cnr <dig> and cnr <dig>  duplicated from a single proto-orthologue in the vertebrate stem of the chordate lineage  <cit> .

for the glycoprotein endo-alpha- <dig> -mannosidase family, all four methods of reconstruction produced similar topologies in which the tree did not branch into separate manea and maneal clades due to the inclusion of teleost manea sequences as the external branch of a clade containing solely other vertebrate maneal sequences . we tested the hypothesis that tree topology was being influenced by mutational saturation at a proportion of sites in the alignment. when saturated positions were removed from the analysis, a nj topology was obtained splitting the tree into separate vertebrate manea and maneal clades . therefore, it is possible that mutational saturation caused an aberrant branching of teleost manea sequences and that the corrected tree again reflects a duplication event of a manea/maneal proto-orthologue in a common vertebrate ancestor.

in most vertebrate classes, two members of the potassium voltage-gated channel family  were located in the respective genomic neighbourhood of akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> . this gene family contains up to five members in diploid vertebrates and  <dig> members in the c. intestinalis genome. all methods of phylogenetic analysis produced near identical topologies with a clade including vertebrate and c. intestinalis kcnq <dig> orthologues that branched externally to remaining family members . internal to this clade, the other c. intestinalis kcnq sequence branched externally to the remaining four vertebrate kcnq sequences, which split into two well-supported clades containing kcnq2/ <dig> and kcnq4/ <dig> sequences respectively . these clades split into sub-clades containing individual kcnq <dig> and  <dig> orthologues and kcnq <dig> and  <dig> orthologues . this branching pattern can be explained by two duplication events in the vertebrate lineage, where a single proto-orthologue to kcnq2/3/4/ <dig>  duplicated to create two ancestor genes to kcnq2/ <dig> and kcnq4/ <dig> which both duplicated again to produce kcnq <dig>  kcnq <dig>  kcnq <dig> and kcnq <dig> genes as conserved in current vertebrate genomes.

the branching patterns of these gene families, are therefore generally consistent, not only with at least one duplication event in a common ancestor to mammals, birds, frogs and fishes, but in the case of the highlighted members, often reflect their respective chromosomal proximity to akirin <dig> or akirin <dig>  in other words, when orthologues from a gene family  were located in the genomic neighbourhood of either akirin <dig> or  <dig>  paralogues from that family  tended to be proximal to, or at least on the same chromosome as the other akirin copy. a parsimonious explanation for these findings is that a duplication event occurred in the vertebrate stem of the chordates that affected a chromosomal region containing both proto-orthologues to akirin and to components of neighbouring gene families. two-rounds of genome polyploidisation in vertebrates has been long been proposed  and support for this hypothesis has been obtained by comparing vertebrate genome organisation, with deuterostome relatives with unduplicated genomes, including urochordates  <cit>  and recently cephalochordates  <cit> . for example, putnam et al. showed that gnathostome genomes share quadruple conserved synteny with the branchiostoma floridae genome providing 'conclusive evidence for two rounds of duplication on the jawed vertebrate stem'  <cit> . however, this idea has been historically controversial and certain studies using phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate gene families found a lack of supporting statistical evidence e.g.  <cit> , while others found results compatible with the hypothesis e.g.  <cit> .

test for selection and functional divergence after the akirin duplication
it is widely accepted that gene duplication can create opportunities for functional divergence in paralogues. divergence is thought to occur where one duplicate retains the original protein function and the other accumulates changes,  or alternatively, through the partitioning of the functions of an unduplicated ancestor protein . whatever the mechanism, if functional divergence has occurred between duplicated genes, then it should be observable as changes within their coding regions, since functionally important and non-functionally important residues should evolve under different constraints.

it is known that akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> differ in at least one function  <cit> . the branch length leading to the akirin <dig> clade is extended relative to akirin <dig> in all phylogenies, . this suggests that after the akirin duplication, akirin <dig> evolved at a faster rate than akirin <dig>  this result was confirmed by significant relative rate test results for several vertebrate lineages . to examine whether this difference in evolutionary rate was accompanied by altered selective constraints, we examined pairwise rates of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions between akirin <dig> and  <dig> for several vertebrate lineages. two approaches were implemented: firstly, the likelihood method of goldman and yang  <cit>  and secondly, the nei-gojobori approach  <cit> . both results were comparable and low dn/ds ratios  were estimated when different vertebrate lineages were compared for akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> . specifically, dn/ds ratios averaged from both methods, were ~ <dig>  for akirin <dig> and ~ <dig>  for akirin <dig>  thus, akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> proteins, as a whole, have evolved under comparably strict purifying selection.

it is known from both a large-scale protein-protein interaction study  <cit>  and specific studies  <cit>  that the ancestor protein to akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> has many binding partners  and several of these are conserved in equivalent vertebrate pathways . thus, there are many potential residues of functional significance in akirin  that may have evolved at different rates between akirin <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, binding sites for 14-3- <dig> proteins have been biochemically confirmed in akirin <dig>  <cit> . statistical methods have been proposed to predict whether functional divergence of related members of a protein family has occurred  and identify the most likely residues involved . initially, we used a likelihood ratio test  implemented in the program diverge  <cit>  to test the hypothesis that functional divergence of akirin <dig> and  <dig> was a reflection of a shift in evolutionary rates at certain amino acid sites between paralogues . the model underlying this approach was described in  <cit> . to summarise, we tested whether the coefficient of functional divergence  between akirin <dig> and  <dig> clusters in the phylogenetic tree topology provided , was > <dig>  the lrt predicted that functional divergence had occurred between akirin <dig> and  <dig> . next, diverge was used to establish the posterior probability of type-i divergence at each site in the alignment . employing a cut-off posterior probability value of  <dig> , ~ <dig> sites were predicted as the most likely candidate sites for type-i functional divergence. for comparative purposes, the same alignment and phylogeny was submitted to a ml lrt, which, like the bayesian method provides a statistical framework where evolutionary rate shifts at particular protein positions can be established  <cit> . the statistically most likely positions predicted to underlie functional divergence were comparable by both methods, particularly for the highest-ranking candidates . high scoring positions were mapped onto an amino acid alignment of the akirin gene family, in relation to known functional motifs . a pdf output of the ml analysis, in its original format, is also provided .

the extreme n-terminus  and c-terminus  of akirin proteins are clearly under strong purifying selection based on the near absence of fast-evolving sites  and the presence of many sites that have evolved at a significantly slower rate than the average of all positions . further, in these n and c-terminal regions, very few sites  are predicted to contribute to functional divergence between akirin <dig> and  <dig> . of the last  <dig> sites in akirins, 20% are conserved from basal metazoans to vertebrates and ~55% code for isofunctional replacements . additionally, it is only the ~ <dig> most c-terminal residues that share significant identify with the basal amoebozoan and protist orthologues . therefore these conserved regions must perform essential functions common to akirins and are obvious candidates for experimental characterisation.

a known functional motif found in akirins, is a highly conserved n-terminal nls  <cit>  . as expected, sites within this motif have evolved significantly slower than the average in all akirins , in support of its necessity for nuclear localisation as demonstrated in insect and mammalian akirins  <cit> . further, another nls was predicted in psort <dig>  <cit>  to be present in akirin of invertebrate deuterostomes  and akirin <dig>  but not akirin <dig> . however, rate shifts at these sites were not predicted to contribute to functional divergence between paralogues. interestingly, akirin <dig> was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> . further experimental tests will be needed to examine whether this second nls augments the nuclear import of akirin and akirin <dig> proteins relative to akirin <dig>  which would have important implications for the sub-cellular context of the vertebrate paralogues.

almost all of the highest scoring candidate positions for functional divergence between akirin paralogues are found in the middle region of the protein , which also has numerous sites that evolved at a significantly higher rate in both akirin <dig> and  <dig> compared to the average of all positions . the highest scoring site for functional divergence in both the bayesian analysis and ml lrt  corresponds to a proline conserved in all akirin <dig> orthologues, two invertebrate akirin orthologues but not in akirin <dig> proteins . in all tetrapod and most teleost akirin <dig> orthologues, as well as hemichordate akirin, this site is the final residue of a putative 14-3-3-recognition site, biochemically validated in rodent akirin  <dig> . further, two other high scoring positions fall either on putative 14-3- <dig> binding sites  or are just upstream of a 14-3- <dig> binding site conserved in both akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> . it is feasible that these sites have contributed to altered 14-3- <dig> binding properties of akirin <dig> and  <dig>  another region that is a strong candidate for type-i divergence between akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> is found at sites 58– <dig>  in this region, 5/ <dig> positions have evolved at a significantly slower rate in akirin <dig> than akirin <dig>  and are among the highest scoring candidate residues for type-i functional divergence . this region may be a binding site that is functional in the invertebrate akirins and akirin <dig>  but not in akirin <dig> 

putative 14-3- <dig> binding sites in akirins
of the five 14-3- <dig> protein-binding sites identified in rat akirin <dig>  <cit> , four are conserved across amniote orthologues , and fewer in teleost orthologues . akirin <dig> has between one and four putative 14-3- <dig> binding sites across a broad phylogenetic range of vertebrates, generally in regions conserved with at least one akirin <dig> protein. deuterostome invertebrate akirins generally have two to four 14-3- <dig> binding sites, usually in regions aligning with vertebrate akirins, but rarely with other invertebrate akirins . the m. brevicollis, d. discoideum and n. gruberi orthologues have a single putative 14-3- <dig> binding site whereas g. theta has none . therefore, the number of potential 14-3- <dig> binding sites in akirin proteins increased rapidly at the base of metazoan evolution. however, sites are absent or greatly reduced in certain metazoan lineages, including d. melanogaster , anopheles gambiae , lumbricus rubellus  and caenorhabditis elegans  . the preferred binding motifs of 14-3- <dig> proteins are arg-ser-x-ser-x-pro and arg-x-x-x-ser-x-pro, although functional variations in these motifs are tolerated  <cit> . almost invariably, sites in akirin proteins have the consensus-binding site ser/thr-x-pro or ser-x-ser/thr-x-pro . the single exception is the sea squirt sequence, which has a perfect site  . unsurprisingly, multiple sites were needed for the formation of the akirin2–14-3- <dig> complex  <cit> . considering the variability in the number  and physical locations of 14-3- <dig> sites, it is likely that the binding affinity for 14-3- <dig> proteins will vary considerably between akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> paralogues within vertebrate species and between orthologues from different lineages.

a synthesis of information on akirin function
in this section, we combine the findings of this study with available literature on the known roles of akirin genes in order to provide novel insight into their biochemical functions. we hope that this will prompt the sharing of akirin literature between researchers from different fields and open up new avenues of investigation.

consistent with the embryonic lethal knockdown of akirin and akirin <dig> in flies and mice respectively  <cit> , the ablation of akirin in the embryos of the nematode c. elegans by rnai knockdown was also lethal . further, rnai knockdown of akirin in ticks  dramatically affected the growth and fertility phenotype, with enormous associated reductions in survival, weight and oviposition, as well as developmental abnormalities in several different tissues  <cit> . these findings support the idea that akirin is an essential developmental gene across a broad phylogenetic range of metazoans. another conserved feature of akirins in metazoans is their nuclear localisation . this is supported by significantly faster rates of evolution in multiple sites of akirin <dig> compared to its paralogue . however, there were also several sites that have evolved faster in akirin <dig> than akirin <dig>  and could represent regions where a function has been conserved in akirin <dig> but was lost in akirin <dig>  it is known that akirin <dig>  has a role in regulating vertebrate myogenesis, as it was identified in mice from a suppression subtraction hybridization cdna library produced using myostatin-null mice as the 'tester' material  <cit> . myostatin  is a potent negative regulator of mammalian myogenesis and mice lacking a functional copy have a double-muscled phenotype  <cit> . akirin <dig> was reportedly upregulated in the muscles of myostatin-/- mice  <cit> . mstn protein was also shown to inhibit the transcription of the akirin <dig> proximal promoter  <cit> . interestingly, akirin <dig> also functions in myogenesis in flies. specifically, akirin  bound the bhlh factor twist and this interaction was necessary for the normal expression of twist target proteins  <cit> , representing another example of akirins as co-regulators of transcription. fly mutants lacking akirin had considerable defects in muscle mass and morphology  <cit> . this is a strikingly opposite phenotype to that induced by the overexpression of akirin <dig> in mdx mice, where muscle mass, fibre size and structural integrity was markedly increased  <cit> . thus, the role of mammalian akirin <dig> in regulating muscle growth may be conserved from the akirin proto-orthologue. if the function of akirin <dig> in amniote muscle growth is essential, then its absence in birds, where muscle physiology is strongly conserved with mammals, particularly in terms of the functions of key genes , could only be fulfilled by akirin <dig> 

akirin <dig>  was also shown to promote carcinogenesis by interacting with the phosphoserine-threonine-binding protein 14-3-3β  <cit> . 14-3- <dig> proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and regulate many cellular activities including the cell cycle, intracellular signalling, apoptosis and malignant transformation . the 14-3-3β isoform had previously been shown to regulate tumour formation and was upregulated in several cancer cell lines  <cit>  acting through the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> . akirin <dig> was also upregulated in tumour cell lines and its mrna downregulation reduced tumour metastasis by inducing the expression of map kinase phosphotase  <dig> , which reduced the activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinases , erk <dig> and erk <dig>  <cit> . specifically, the akirin2-14-3-3β complex functioned as a transcriptional repressor of the mkp- <dig> promoter  <cit> . based solely on the presence of a comparable repertoire of 14-3- <dig> protein-binding sites, redundancy of this carcinogenic-promoting function with akirin <dig> cannot be excluded. however, distinct evolutionary rates in positions within, or adjacent to 14-3- <dig> binding sites in akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> are probably important explanatory variables underlying their functional divergence . interestingly, there also exists evidence to suggest that akirin <dig>  like akirin <dig>  indeedfunctions as part of the erk signalling pathway. it is established that the inhibitory effect of myostatin on myogenesis is mediated through activation of components of the mapk/erk signalling pathway  <cit> . akirin <dig> transcription was inhibited by treatment with myostatin protein and conversely was upregulated by chemical inhibition of mek1/erk signalling  <cit> . thus, it was suggested that myostatin signals to akirin <dig> through erk signalling  <cit> .

in vertebrate immune response signalling pathways, akirin <dig> functions at a level close to, or downstream of nf-κb to selectively regulate some of its target genes  <cit> . since a direct interaction of fly akirin and nf-κb was not demonstrated, it was suggested that akirins interact with intermediary components  <cit> . 14-3- <dig> proteins are potential candidates, since they are known to regulate the nuclear localisation of transcription factors, are found in many transcriptional complexes, can bind to histones and can regulate histone acetylation  <cit> . importantly, a 14-3-3-akirin <dig> complex bound to and regulated promoter activity  <cit> . 14-3- <dig> proteins regulate nf-κb activity by binding both iκb and the p <dig> subunit of nf-kb  <cit> . iκb is known to inhibit nf-kb by sequestering p <dig> in the cytoplasm  <cit>  and further, the iκbα isoform also facilitates its nuclear export  <cit> . tnfα treatment induced the nuclear localisation of 14-3- <dig> proteins and the disruption of 14-3-3-protein function caused the nuclear localisation of both iκb and p <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, following tnfα treatment, both iκb and 14-3-3β/γ proteins bound to the promoter regions of il- <dig> and rantes, presumably disrupting the interaction of p <dig> and chromatin  <cit> . it was suggested that 14-3- <dig> proteins formed a complex with iκb and p <dig> that was efficiently exported from the nucleus  <cit> . interestingly, these same nf-kb transcriptional targets  were strongly repressed in akirin <dig> knockout mice following tlr, il-1β and tnfα treatment  <cit> . therefore, an interesting line of investigation will be to examine whether the transcriptional repression of nf-kb targets in akirin <dig> knockout mice is accounted for by altered 14-3-3-protein activity. in addition to a predicted interaction with 14-3- <dig> proteins to regulate chromatin, fly akirin  was shown to bind bap <dig>  <cit> , a dna binding protein that forms part of the swi/snf-like chromatin remodelling complex  <cit>  which is highly conserved in eukaryotes. akirin also interacts with the gata-transcriptional activator pannier  <cit>  and with tdp <dig>  <cit> , , a highly conserved rna binding protein with roles in transcriptional repression  <cit>  and in regulating exon skipping  <cit> . it is also noteworthy, that fly akirin physically interacts with cg <dig>  <cit> , a protein with high homology to a e <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubc <dig> forms part of the ubiquitin-conjugating complex important in the activation of ikk  through traf <dig>  <cit> . cg <dig>  like akirin, also binds to the chromatin remodelling protein bap <dig>  <cit> , indicating a wider protein-interaction network.

14-3- <dig> proteins are also known to regulate insulin-like growth factor signalling, a pathway activated by akirin <dig> overexpression  <cit> . the 14-3-3ε isoform binds to phosphorylated forms of both the igf-i receptor  and the insulin receptor substrate-i   <cit>  while the 14-3-3β-isoform binds to activated irs-i reducing its ability to activate pi kinase k)  <cit> . during myogenesis, a feed-forward cascade occurs, where igf-ii secreted during early myoblast differentiation, binds to and activates the igf-ir, in turn activating irs- <dig>  and the pik-akt phosphorylation pathway, which then promotes efficient transcriptional activation of muscle differentiation genes through a myod-e-protein complex and several known co-factors  <cit> . in myoblasts overexpressing akirin <dig>  differentiation was accelerated, with a concurrent increase in myod, myogenin and igf-ii protein expression, activated akt expression and a massive increase in the transcription of igf-ii mrna  <cit> . these results suggest that akirin <dig> can stimulate igf-ii-pik-akt signalling, culminating in the transcription of muscle differentiation genes. akirin <dig> has several low affinity 14-3- <dig> binding sites  and was detected in the cytoplasm  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the positive effect of akirin <dig> on the igf-ii signalling pathway is mediated through binding 14-3- <dig> proteins in the cytoplasm, sequestering them and effectively stimulating the activation of the igf1-r and irs- <dig> and downstream components of the pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the akirin gene family is clearly essential to many physiological functions in metazoans and operates in several characterised signalling pathways. this paper provides a necessary evolutionary scaffold to guide future investigations of eukaryote akirins. our exhaustive genomic screens, coupled with the implementation of a common akirin nomenclature, should aid researchers in identifying new functions of akirins and encourage the propagation of existing research between disciplines. molecular evolution analyses indicate that vertebrate akirin <dig> and akirin <dig> proteins have diverged in function and we provide a list of potential underlying candidate residues. an interesting line of future investigation will be to further examine the role played by akirin-14-3- <dig> protein interactions in regulating gene expression and signalling cascades in innate immune, myogenic and carcinogenic pathways.
