BACKGROUND
the phytohormone auxin is central to the regulation of plant growth and development. processes controlled by auxin include apical dominance, adventitious root formation, tropic responses, vascular patterning and root hair development  <cit> . these diverse morphological events are brought about by changes in cell division, expansion and differentiation  <cit> , and many of them are mediated by the ability of auxin to control gene expression. several families of genes containing auxin response elements  in their promoters, are rapidly transcriptionally upregulated as a primary response to auxin  <cit> , including members of the aux/iaa gene family.

the aux/iaa genes form a large multi-gene family found throughout the plant kingdom  <cit> . there are  <dig> members in arabidopsis and their expression varies with respect to tissue specificity, auxin induction kinetics and sensitivity to auxin dose  <cit> . aux/iaa proteins are characterised by four highly conserved domains  <cit> . c-terminal domains iii and iv mediate homo- and hetero-dimerisation between aux/iaa proteins  <cit> . domains iii and iv are also found in the auxin response factor  family of transcription factors, a subset of which activate transcription from auxre-containing promoters  <cit> . conservation of domains iii and iv between the aux/iaas and arfs allows combinatorial dimerisation amongst these families. the n-terminal domain i of aux/iaa proteins functions as a transcriptional repression domain  <cit> . thus, dimers between aux/iaas and activator arfs block gene transcription  <cit> .

most aux/iaa proteins are extremely unstable, with half-lives ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes  <cit> . they interact via domain ii with scftir <dig>  and other auxin receptor f-box-containing e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, which target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . auxin promotes their association with such e3s, increasing their turnover  <cit> . thus transcriptional auxin responses are mediated by the auxin-induced destabilisation of aux/iaa proteins, which relieves associated activator arfs from repression and in turn, upregulates transcription from auxres  <cit> . since aux/iaa genes contain auxres in their promoters, this provides a feedback mechanism for regulating their own expression. furthermore, it allows aux/iaas to control each other's expression creating a complex network of cross regulation amongst the family.

dominant or semi-dominant mutations resulting in hyper-stabilisation of individual aux/iaas have been isolated in at least  <dig> aux/iaa genes from arabidopsis  <cit> . such stabilising mutations occur in domain ii and act by reducing the affinity of the aux/iaa for scftir <dig>  conferring pleiotropic auxin related phenotypes. for axr3/iaa <dig>  two such gain-of-function alleles have been described  <cit> . axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig> plants show increased apical dominance, increased adventitious root formation, agravitropic roots, no root hairs, and epinastic petioles. these phenotypes are generally consistent with an increase in the magnitude of auxin responses. however, similar mutations in other aux/iaa genes cause reduced auxin responses in some tissues and increased responses in other tissue types  <cit> .

although the study of the aux/iaa and arf families has elucidated many of the early events in auxin signal transduction, there is an ongoing requirement to find upstream regulators and novel targets of aux/iaa and arf regulated transcription. here we present the isolation and characterisation of an extragenic recessive mutant, pax1- <dig>  which partially suppresses the phenotypes of semi-dominant axr <dig> alleles. the pax1- <dig> single mutant shows pleiotropic phenotypes consistent with altered auxin responses. double mutant analyses suggest that pax <dig> also interacts genetically with other members of the aux/iaa family. we propose that pax <dig> acts upstream of aux/iaa genes by regulating their transcription.

RESULTS
mutant isolation
to search for new mutants altered in auxin signalling and more specifically, to find novel genetic interactors with axr <dig>  we screened x-ray-mutagenised axr3- <dig>  plants for reversion of their strict apical dominance. the mutagenised seed were also homozygous for the gl1- <dig> mutation  so that revertant lines could be distinguished from contaminating wild-type plants. one line recovered from the screen showed increased numbers of axillary branches arising from the shoot, compared with axr3- <dig> controls . the dwarf phenotype and dark green, curled leaves caused by the axr3- <dig> mutation were also partially suppressed in the revertant. in addition, the carpels were relatively longer than the sepals and petals, such that they protruded from the closed flower buds. revertant plants were outcrossed to wild-type  plants and segregation of individuals in the f <dig> generation morphologically similar to axr3- <dig> homozygotes indicated that the suppressor mutation is extragenic to axr <dig>  thus, the new mutant was named partial suppressor of axr3- <dig> . segregation analysis also suggested that the pax1- <dig> mutation is recessive to wild type and that it is linked to axr3- <dig> .

morphological phenotypes of pax1- <dig> seedlings
to gain insight into the wild-type role of pax <dig>  a detailed analysis of the pax1- <dig> mutant phenotype in a wild-type genetic background was carried out. germination is slower in pax1- <dig> mutants compared with wild-type seeds . pax1- <dig> hypocotyls are longer than wild-type when grown under a long day photoperiod, as a result of an increased growth rate . in contrast, dark grown hypocotyl elongation was not significantly different from wild-type . however, the rate of root growth is reduced in pax1- <dig> mutants , and pax1- <dig> roots are abnormally straight, indicating that they have a reduced root wave response .

pax1- <dig> plants produce root hairs at a higher density than wild-type and with altered morphology . pax1- <dig> hairs are approximately 34% shorter than wild-type root hairs , and develop in aberrant patterns. in wild-type arabidopsis, the root epidermis is arranged in longitudinal files of cells  <cit> . each file is composed entirely of either hair-forming cells  or non-hair-forming cells , and each trichoblast forms a single root hair. however, in pax1- <dig> some trichoblasts produce multiple hairs, with up to  <dig> hairs observed per cell . these hairs arise from a single initiation site. thus, the increase in root hair density can be attributed at least partially to the development of multiple hairs from some trichoblasts. also, some hairs form branches during the rapid tip growth phase of hair elongation, resulting in stalked, branched structures. therefore pax <dig> appears to affect both the orientation and the amount of root hair elongation.

auxin response of pax1- <dig> mutants
to test the auxin response of pax1- <dig> roots, seedlings were transferred to medium containing various concentrations of the natural auxin, indole-3-acetic acid  and root elongation was measured  <dig> days later. on increasing concentrations of iaa between  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm, wild-type root growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner . pax1- <dig> root elongation follows a similar dose response to iaa as wild-type.

pax <dig> and axr <dig> interact genetically
to characterise in more detail the effect of pax1- <dig> on the axr3- <dig> phenotype, we re-crossed pax1- <dig> into an axr3- <dig> background. we also constructed double mutants between pax1- <dig> and a second, weaker semi-dominant allele, axr3- <dig>  in order to assess the allele specificity of suppression. axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig> show severely reduced root growth compared with wild-type   <cit> . however, in double mutants with pax1- <dig>  root elongation is increased by  <dig> percent and  <dig> percent, respectively. this effect is particularly striking considering that the pax1- <dig> mutation causes a reduction in root length when in a wild-type background. thus, pax <dig> appears to be required for the full inhibition of root growth by axr <dig> gain-of-function alleles. other aspects of the root phenotype are also suppressed by pax1- <dig>  in contrast to the axr <dig> single mutants, where root growth apparently wanders randomly with frequent changes in direction , the axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> and axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> double mutant roots grow more towards the gravity vector, and produce more root hairs .

with respect to hypocotyl elongation, a similar interaction to that observed with root growth occurs. during the first few days of growth axr3- <dig> hypocotyls elongate at an increased rate compared with wild-type, followed by a period of slower elongation  <cit> . five days after germination, axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig> hypocotyls are slightly longer than wild-type, similar to pax1- <dig> . however, axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> hypocotyls are no longer than either of the single mutants and axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> hypocotyls are shorter than either single mutant.

all of the axr <dig> shoot phenotypes analysed were partially suppressed by pax1- <dig>  as in the original axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> line isolated from the screen, pax1- <dig> suppresses the increase in apical dominance caused by axr3- <dig> . axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> double mutants produce more secondary inflorescences from rosette and cauline nodes compared with axr3- <dig> homozygotes. conversely, pax1- <dig> single mutants have slightly fewer second order inflorescences than wild-type plants. therefore, pax1- <dig> has opposite effects on shoot branching in axr3- <dig> and wild-type backgrounds. similar results were obtained for the axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> double mutant . axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> and axr3- <dig> pax1- <dig> plants are less dwarfed than axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig>  respectively, despite the fact that pax1- <dig> causes a dwarf phenotype in plants that are wild-type for axr <dig> . also, the leaves of each double mutant are paler green, less epinastic and less curled than the axr <dig> parent .

in summary, pax1- <dig> partially suppresses almost every axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig> phenotype.

mechanism of suppression
two possible mechanisms by which pax1- <dig> may suppress the axr3- <dig> phenotype are:  by increasing the degradation rate of the over-stable axr3- <dig> protein, or  by decreasing the level of axr3- <dig> transcription. to test the first possibility, pax1- <dig> was crossed with transgenic plants expressing amino-terminal domains i and ii of axr3- <dig>  fused to the β-glucuronidase  reporter, under the control of the soybean heat shock promoter   <cit> . this construct is an established reporter for axr3- <dig> protein stability. plants were heat shocked at 37°c for  <dig> h and stained for gus activity at various intervals following heat shock, to monitor the rate of gus turnover. in wild-type plants gus activity remained constant between  <dig> min and  <dig> h following heat shock, showing that the axr3- <dig> protein is not observably degraded during this time period . similar results were observed in a pax1- <dig> background suggesting that pax1- <dig> has no effect on axr3- <dig> turnover . in another experiment, no difference was observed between wild type and pax1- <dig> on the turnover of axr3nt-gus, in which the wild-type domain ii destabilisation sequence is present   <cit> .

to assess whether pax1- <dig> controls axr <dig> transcription, pax1- <dig> was crossed to transgenic plants containing a transcriptional fusion between the axr <dig> promoter and the gus reporter gene . seedlings were stained for gus activity two days after germination. in a wild-type background, gus activity was observed in the root and hypocotyl . however, axr3::gus expression was significantly reduced in pax1- <dig> . gus staining was almost completely absent from the hypocotyl and was greatly reduced in the root.

pax <dig> interacts genetically with aux/iaa genes
to determine whether pax <dig> interacts with other aux/iaa genes, we created double mutants between pax1- <dig> and axr2- <dig>  slr- <dig> and shy2- <dig>  <cit> . these mutants carry semi-dominant mutations in domain ii of iaa <dig>  iaa <dig> and iaa <dig>  respectively  <cit> . like axr3- <dig>  the mutations result in gain-of-function phenotypes due to hyperstabilisation of the encoded proteins. analysis of the double mutant phenotypes showed effects that could be classified into two different categories .

in the first class, the two mutations produced an additive effect. for example, the root length of the axr2- <dig> pax1- <dig> double mutant is less than that of both the axr2- <dig> and pax1- <dig> single mutants, which in turn are both less than wild-type . this suggests that axr2/iaa <dig> and pax <dig> function independently in root elongation, although since the axr2- <dig> mutation is a dominant gain-of-function allele these results must be interpreted with caution. likewise, slr- <dig> and pax1- <dig> had an additive effect on both root and hypocotyl elongation, implying that the two genes act independently during these processes . the effects of shy2- <dig> and pax1- <dig> on root elongation were also additive.

in the second class of genetic interaction, one of the mutations was epistatic to the other. for example, under our growth conditions, five days after germination axr2- <dig> and axr2- <dig> pax1- <dig> hypocotyls were approximately the same length, with axr2- <dig> suppressing the long hypocotyl phenotype of pax1- <dig> . shy2- <dig> was also epistatic to pax1- <dig> with respect to hypocotyl elongation.

pax <dig> and gibberellic acid response
several aerial features of the pax1- <dig> phenotype are suggestive of defects in gibberellic acid  response. these include slow germination, short stature, dark green leaves , protruding pistils  and features indicative of slower phase change  <cit> . plants pass through several distinct phases of development, marked by morphological changes in the lateral organs produced by the shoot apical meristem. in arabidopsis, the first two rosette leaves are relatively round and each subsequent leaf becomes progressively more elongated  <cit> . pax1- <dig> produces rounder leaves than wild type, suggesting that it remains for longer in more juvenile phases of development. to test this, other markers of phase change were compared in pax1- <dig> and wild-type plants. juvenile leaves form trichomes on their adaxial  surfaces but not their abaxial  surfaces, and the transition from the juvenile to the adult phase of vegetative development is marked by the onset of trichome production on the abaxial surfaces of the leaves  <cit> . under our growth conditions, wild-type plants produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  juvenile leaves, lacking abaxial trichomes, whereas pax1- <dig> plants produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . as the rate of pax1- <dig> leaf initiation is reduced, this suggests that the transition to the adult growth phase is delayed both developmentally and temporally. furthermore, floral transition also occurs both developmentally and temporally later than wild type, although this difference is mostly due to the longer juvenile phase of pax1- <dig> .

to test more directly for defects in ga response, pax1- <dig> plants were assayed for hypocotyl elongation on medium supplemented with ga <dig>  wild-type hypocotyl elongation was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous ga <dig> . however in pax1- <dig>  ga-induced growth is reduced compared with wild type.

genetic mapping
from the f <dig> of the outcross of the original pax1- <dig> axr3- <dig> double mutant to wild type  pax <dig> was estimated to map approximately  <dig> cm proximal to axr <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  to refine the map position of the pax <dig> locus, pax1- <dig>  plants were crossed to plants of the landsberg erecta  ecotype and the f <dig> generation was scored for segregation of polymorphic molecular markers between the two ecotypes. segregation analysis revealed that pax <dig> maps to a  <dig> kb region between markers snp <dig>  and cer <dig> . the region appears to be somewhat recombinationally suppressed, with an estimated  <dig> kb per cm. attempts to identify the gene by transformation rescue were thwarted by the discovery that the mutant phenotype is unstable, reverting to wild type at a low frequency that was substantially enhanced by the transformation process .

the delimited region includes  <dig> genes, of which only arf <dig> is a clear pax <dig> candidate, given its predicted role in the regulation of aux/iaa gene expression. however, dna sequencing of the arf <dig> locus, including  <dig>  kb upstream of the predicted translation start, from pax1- <dig>  revealed no mutations. furthermore arf <dig> insertion mutants were reported to have no phenotype  <cit> , and trans-heterozygotes between an arf <dig> mutant and pax1- <dig> are phenotypically wild-type  suggesting that pax <dig> and arf <dig> are not allelic. thus, pax <dig> is likely to be a previously unknown component of the aux/iaa regulatory network.

discussion
pax suppresses axr <dig> gain-of-function alleles
in this paper we present the isolation and characterisation of a new arabidopsis mutant, pax1- <dig>  which partially suppresses the phenotype of axr <dig> gain-of-function alleles. virtually every aspect of the axr <dig> mutant phenotype analysed is suppressed at least partially by pax1- <dig>  this is particularly compelling in cases where pax1- <dig> confers a more wild-type phenotype on axr <dig> mutants, despite having the opposite effect in a wild-type background. examples of such are during root and hypocotyl elongation, and in the outgrowth of axillary inflorescences. these results suggest that pax <dig> may encode a general positive regulator of axr <dig> action. pax <dig> does not appear to act at the level of axr <dig> protein stability since axr3-1nt-gus and axr3nt-gus translational fusions were turned over at similar rates in pax1- <dig> compared to wild type. in contrast, expression of an axr3::gus reporter was down-regulated in a pax1- <dig> mutant background suggesting that in wild-type plants, pax <dig> regulates axr <dig> transcription positively. consistent with this idea, suppression of the axr <dig> phenotypes is not allele specific, as might be expected if the effect was at the protein level.

this suggests a model for the suppression of axr3- <dig> and axr3- <dig> phenotypes by pax1- <dig>  such phenotypes are caused by axr <dig> hyperstabilisation leading to the accumulation of increased protein levels. therefore, reduced axr <dig> transcription in pax1- <dig> would result in lower levels of axr <dig> protein accumulation, and thus weaker axr <dig> phenotypes. although this model is attractive, we have been unable to detect reliable differences from wild-type in the steady state levels the endogenous axr <dig> mrna in the pax1- <dig> mutant background . this might be because of the differences are tissue specific and therefore less easy to detect by rt-pcr than by histochemical gus staining. however, it is also possible that the axr3::gus reporter does not accurately reflect the expression of the endogenous gene, as is often the case with promoter-gus reporters. whilst this would argue against a model of axr3- <dig> suppression by specific transcriptional down-regulation of axr <dig>  our results none the less suggest that the pax1- <dig> phenotype may be mediated by changes in transcription of auxin-regulated genes, since the reporter construct is rapidly auxin responsive .

pax <dig> and other aux/iaas
double mutant analysis demonstrates that pax <dig> interacts genetically with other members of the aux/iaa family in addition to axr <dig>  however, unlike its interaction with axr <dig>  where virtually all phenotypes are suppressed, a more complex set of interactions is observed with the other aux/iaas tested. pax1- <dig> shows combinations of epistatic and additive phenotypes with axr2- <dig>  slr- <dig> or shy2- <dig>  furthermore, the type of interaction pax1- <dig> has with different aux/iaa mutants, varies in different organs.

one explanation for the more complex set of interactions observed is that the effects of pax <dig> on other members of the aux/iaa family are indirect. since aux/iaa genes regulate each others' transcription, alterations in the expression level of one aux/iaa gene  could have downstream and feedback effects on the transcription of other family members. therefore, the primary targets of pax <dig> may include axr <dig> transcription, whereas the effect on other aux/iaas may be secondary. thus in a pax1- <dig> background, the phenotypes may result from widespread alterations in the balance of the aux/iaa-arf network, triggered by primary changes in just a few genes.

pax1- <dig> is defective in auxin-regulated development
a prediction of our model is that pax1- <dig> should have auxin-related phenotypes in a wild-type background. indeed, many aspects of the pax1- <dig> phenotype are reminiscent of defects in auxin transport or signal transduction. for example, root, hypocotyl and stem elongation are regulated by auxin, and mutations in components of auxin signalling, such as aux/iaa and arf family members, lead to perturbations in these processes  <cit> . a mutant in arf <dig> flowers late, suggesting that auxin may also control floral transition  <cit> . another auxin-mediated process is root waving, with transport and signalling mutants displaying abnormal patterns of waving  <cit> . furthermore, exogenous auxin affects root hair elongation and morphology, whilst many auxin response mutants show altered root hair growth  <cit> .

although the data discussed above suggest that pax <dig> is involved in auxin response, pax1- <dig> roots show a wild-type growth response to exogenous iaa. this is consistent with the idea that the aux/iaa-arf network is differently configured but not globally down-regulated in the mutant, so that some phenotypes are suggestive of auxin resistance, but others are not. analysis of the loss of function phenotypes of individual aux/iaas and arfs demonstrates that the network is very robust with significant functional redundancy. if the pax <dig> gene acts to modulate the network, it is therefore likely to affect more than one network member.

pax <dig> and ga response
another aspect of the pax1- <dig> phenotype is apparent defects in ga response. ga promotes germination and phase change, and increases stem and floral organ elongation  <cit> . pax1- <dig> plants show decreased germination, delayed phase change, reduced stem length, and altered floral organ elongation. consistent with pax <dig> functioning in ga responses, mutant hypocotyls treated with ga are resistant to its growth-promoting effects.

these data implicate pax <dig> in both auxin and ga responses. auxin is required for ga signalling, by regulating the ga-induced degradation of della growth repressor proteins  <cit> . furthermore, ga mediated destabilisation of the della protein rga is reduced in the auxin resistant mutant, axr1- <dig>  axr <dig> encodes a regulator of an e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase responsible for aux/iaa turnover, and thus axr <dig> may control della protein levels through the destabilisation of aux/iaas  <cit> . in such a case, effects of pax <dig> on aux/iaa expression levels could be sufficient to alter della protein turnover. in addition, ga metabolism may be affected since axr <dig> and other aux/iaas are thought to regulate transcription of ga metabolism genes directly <cit> . alternatively, pax <dig> might control ga signalling and/or metabolism independently of its effects on aux/iaa protein levels.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic analysis of the pax-1- <dig> mutant demonstrates that pax <dig> positively regulates axr3/iaa <dig> transcription. pax <dig> also interacts genetically with other aux/iaas, although these effects may occur secondarily through its ability to regulate axr <dig>  in addition, ga responses are clearly affected by pax <dig>  thus the pax <dig> locus is important for both auxin and ga signalling. understanding the mechanisms that underlie cross talk between different plant hormones is currently of great interest to plant biologists. thus the cloning and molecular analysis of pax <dig> should have valuable implications for the hormone signalling community.
