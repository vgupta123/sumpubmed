BACKGROUND
molecular networks in cells are highly complex and dynamic. the global behaviour of these webs and their behavioral patterns are far too complicated to intuitively understand their logic. one way to address this problem is to represent them in terms of simplified interaction graphs combining both biological data and mathematical methods  <cit> .

much effort has been devoted to extract some general features of such networks, dissect them into hierarchical levels, modules and motifs to understand their functionalities, dynamics and evolution  <cit> . simple switches and oscillators have been shown to map to the core processes of biological decision-making, implemented by two- or three-gene network motifs and characterized by their behaviour around the systems' fixed points  <cit> . however, it is reasonable to think that not only the system's steady state is of interest, but also the way such equilibrium is achieved. such transient behavior might be characteristic, somehow representing the function performed by the genetic circuitry. in some circumstances, such as in stress responses, a quick change might be favorable  <cit> , whereas in other occasions, e.g. cell-cell intercommunication, it might be more adequate to filter noisy signals and respond only under absolute certainty  <cit> .

transcriptional networks regulating cell responses exhibit several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which appear at frequencies much higher than expected by chance, suggesting that they may have specific functions in the information processing performed by the network. over the last years, powerful bioinformatic tools such as fanmod  <cit>  have been developed to detect motif distributions in complex transcriptional networks. one of these motifs is the feed-forward loop , defined by a transcription factor x that regulates a second transcription factor y, such that both x and y jointly regulate a target gene z . many examples of ffls can be found in complex transcriptional networks. for example, in e. coli, ffl is present in the l-arabinose system, where protein crp is the general transcription factor  and arac is the specific transcription factor . this motif regulates  <dig> effector operons in  <dig> different systems in the network database  <cit> . a second example can be found in saccharomyces network, where the protein mcm <dig>  regulates the expression of swi <dig> . both proteins mcm <dig> and swi <dig> regulate the final expression of clb <dig>  in the yeast network,  <dig> regulators have been found that are involved in  <dig> feedforward loops potentially controlling  <dig> genes  <cit> . in general, ffls are known to be associated to multiple key regulations, exhibiting different functionalities, e.g. under conditions of glucose starvation , nitrogen limitation , and noxious drugs , these regulators act as x in a c <dig> type ffl. on the other hand, i <dig> type ffls in yeast include anaerobic metabolism  and nitrogen starvation  systems  <cit> . in this context, the question about the relation between the functional response implemented by ffls and their topology arises. the study of the response of three-gene feed-forward loops upon external input shows that they are capable of either implementing transient pulsing  or, filtering  dynamics  <cit> . however, despite it seems clear that motif topology has an impact on its functionality, is the mapping between motif topology and the possible dynamics one-to-one? some studies have demonstrated that topology does not necessarily determine function  <cit> . most analysis focused on motif's function have been carried out considering single motif networks. however, recent studies  <cit>  have provided evidence that for complex networks, the embedding of the motif with the rest of the network needs to be taken into account.

here we have developed a method to systematically study the different functions which can be implemented by each ffl motif and how the topology determines univocally the distribution of probabilities for these functions. a will be shown below, this distribution is correlated with the degree of specialization or flexibility of each motif, by taking into account the different likelihood to perform any function. in other words: topology determines the motif's level of functional specialization. recently, a similar question on the context of genetic clocks has been addressed  <cit> . the conclusions of the study suggest that for these clocks topology does not determine dynamics univocally. although our analysis focuses on single motifs, our results provide new insights to understand the different distribution of motifs in more complex networks, as we will discuss later.

in order to analyze the relation between ffl's functionalities and topology we will describe our biological systems in terms of a set of differential equations:

   

describing how concentration of different species y and z change during time. here Ẏ and Ż represent the derivatives dy/dt and dz/dt, respectively. the ffl topology is implicitly described by functions g and h. assuming that expression of x is unregulated, the dynamics of the system can be represented in a two-dimensional diagram displaying y against z, the so called phase space. in the absence of input, the system evolves towards a stable state, i.e. a specific set of values for the concentrations of y and z that remain constant over time. this stable state is determined by the crossing of the so-called nullclines of the system  <cit>  described by the curves Ẏ =  <dig> and Ż =  <dig>  i.e. g =  <dig> and h =  <dig> respectively. these curves define the points of the phase space where y and z do not change. the nullclines capture the essence of the dynamical potential of each component and the relevant chemical, physical or biological constraints. their shapes reflect saturation effects, forbidden ranges of variables or how fast each component responds to perturbations. in other words, a careful analysis of nullclines allows us to understand the dynamics of the underlying systems and its biological implications. the crossings between both nullclines define stable fixed points, where concentrations of both y and z remain constant. upon input the shape of the nullclines change, providing a new, different stable state. hence, the system will evolve toward this new state following a trajectory, i.e. a set of intermediate states  within the available phase space.

as will be shown below, we can analyse the geometrical requirements necessary in order to observe different responses to be generated and the probability for a certain ffl to implement a given function independent of the set of parameters. the main message of our work is that topological interactions encode the shape of the nullclines, which in turn determines the limits of possibilities. the functional response of the ffl depends on the parameter configuration within these limitations. in other words, motif structure does not determine its function, but encodes the probability of potential functions that can be implemented. this paper is organized as follows: we first introduce the general model of the ffl based on odes and their respective nullclines. departing from the nullcline scenarios we determine the constraints imposed onto the dynamics of the response of the ffl. finally, these constraints are formalized analytically in such a way that all feasible types of behaviour can be evaluated. this evaluation allows for the first time to draw generally valid conclusions on the relation between motif topology and function in ffls.

RESULTS
general model of the ffl
the analysis is focused on the most general ffl formed by three genes. we assume that the gene circuit acts as a functional unit responding to an external input by producing output. in figure  we show an schematic representation of the ffl, depicting three genes gx, gy and gz, with regulatory interactions among each other via their corresponding proteins x, y and z.

gene gx  has a constant production of its protein which is independent of the regulation of the other proteins. we assume that x, however, is synthesized in its inactive form and needs an external effector  for its activation. the concentration of active x without input is negligible. upon addition of effector, the activation of x proceeds very rapidly compared to synthesis and decay and hence, can be approximated by a step function

   

as in  <cit> . in the following, x will denote the active protein. transcription of gy and gz is subjected to internal regulation. production of y depends on regulator x, whereas production of z depends on both x and y. the ffl can be described by the following odes

   

   

the parameter γi represents the basal production of protein i, where i = {x, y, z}. in this parameter we subsume the concentration of all biochemical elements which remain constant in time. the degradation rate of protein i is denoted as di. the binding equilibrium of the regulators j with the gene gi are denoted by , with j = {x, y, z}. the tunable positive parameters αx and βj describe the type of regulatory interactions, i.e. activation or inhibition, for gene gy and gz, respectively, without any predefined specific assumptions. they provide the regulatory rates with respect to the basal transcription. values <  <dig> correspond to inhibitory regulation, whereas >  <dig> accounts for activation. the parameter βxy accounts for the simultaneous regulation of gz.

traditionally, studies on ffl dynamics have been performed under the assumption of boolean logic  <cit>  for the control of the output regulation. the presented model includes all theses cases as specific subsets of parameters. for example, assuming a boolean and logic for a circuit, where the output z is positively regulated by y and x, is described by the following parameter configuration: βx = βy =  <dig>  βxy >  <dig> and . the same circuit displaying or logic requires βx = βy >  <dig>  βxy =  <dig> and  =  <dig> 

finally, n and m denote the degree of multimerization of the regulators. the presented results, however, are considering the general case independent of the size of the regulatory factors.

nullclines' analysis: changes of the nullclines upon input
the system's fixed points can be determined by inspection of the crossings of its nullclines. the studied input-output system will remain stable unless an external input pushes the ffl towards another stable equilibrium. the ffls dynamical response upon this change depends on a specific configuration of circuit parameters. notwithstanding, the possible response-dynamics are restricted by the shape of the nullclines. the general expressions for the nullclines are obtained imposing Ẏ =  <dig> and Ż  <cit>  and written as follows:

   

   

for a general analysis of the nullclines' shape independent of the specific parameters and the size of the multimeric regulators, we focus on a simple set of geometrical features. within the phase space spanned by {y, z}, the nullcline  is a simple, vertical straight line. nullcline  shows an horizontal asymptote located at

   

and crosses the vertical axis at

   

furthermore, expression  shows a single inflection point, i.e. a point where curvature changes from concave to convex or viceversa, in the biological domain defined by y ≥  <dig> and z ≥  <dig>  but no extrema . in order to understand how the input triggers the dynamical response, we study the configuration of the two nullclines with x =  <dig>  i.e. no input, versus x >  <dig>  i.e. with input. in figure  we show a numerical example. in absence of input, the system is governed by a single stable fixed point, denoted by ϕx =  <dig>  located at the crossing of the nullclines  and . on addition of input, the fixed point moves, because the nullcline configuration changes. now the system shifts from ϕx =  <dig> to the new stable fixed point ϕx >  <dig>  the point ϕx >  <dig> is determined by the crossing of the new location of the nullclines for x >  <dig>  the dynamical response of the system, which is represented by the trajectory of the ffl in phase space, is generated by this change of the stable regime. a subset of four parameters, i.e. {αx, βx, βy, βxy}, describing the interactions of the proteins, classify the type of the circuits into coherent and incoherent according to  <cit> . without input, only βy is relevant for the geometry of the nullcline Ż =  <dig>  if βy >  <dig> the nullcline rises, because zha > z <dig>  whereas for βy <  <dig> the nullcline decreases as shown in figure . under the presence of an external input the other parameters become relevant ):

 <dig>  the regulation of y by x, described by αx, defines the direction of the shift of the straight nullcline  regarding its earlier position for x =  <dig> 

 <dig>  the regulation of z by x, described by βx, displaces the crossing of the nullcline  with the vertical axis to a higher  or a lower  value.

 <dig>  finally, the joint regulation βxy of z by x and y, strongly influences the location of the horizontal asymptote zha.

as we will see in the following sections the geometrical features generated by the biological interactions will form the basis for the dynamical behaviour of the ffl.

response of the ffl
to understand how the changes in the nullclines upon input confine the feasible dynamical response of the circuit, we will focus our attention on two representative cases, namely a coherent and an incoherent type . we choose circuits c <dig> and i <dig>  respectively, which differ only in one regulatory interaction in gy, i.e. αx. due to this interaction only nullcline  is affected and with it the direction of its shift as can be seen in figure . the other interactions are the same for both circuit architectures  and hence the possible nullcline's shapes associated to expression  are also the same. in figure  we show their subset of changes realized by the nullcline. based on the positive interaction of βx the crossing point z0|x >  <dig> with the vertical axis always shifts toward higher values for cases with input compared to cases without input .

two biological scenarios for the joint regulation of gz by y and x are plausible: either the complex acts as an activator βxy >  <dig> as shown in figure  or as inhibitor βxy <  <dig>  in  we show the scenario associated with the conditions βxy <  <dig> and βxy > βy. the nullcline moves down, but does not cross the original nullcline. in  conditions βxy <  <dig> and βxy <βy lead to a single crossing. the same conditions can lead to a double crossing of the nullclines, however our numerical analysis  indicates that the probability to find an adequate configuration of parameters has very low probability . for simplicity we discard these cases . by using the relatively simple configuration of the nullclines shown in  we already find different possible behaviour of the two circuits c <dig> and i <dig> due to their opposing αx.

whereas for c <dig> the nullcline's  shifts to higher values, allowing only for grader trajectories , i <dig> may show instead two different functionalities. the shift direction is to lower values and hence either grader or pulser can be implemented depending on the set of parameters . the fact that a range of feasible functional scenarios can be intuitively deduced, demands for a method of unambiguous discrimination to resolve the problem.

separatrix
sometimes, two qualitatively different dynamics are possible for a given set of nullclines ). in that case, if we consider any arbitrary initial point  in phase space  phase space can be divided into two different areas. as shown in figure  this partition of phase space is characterized by a different functional behaviour of the trajectories upon input: starting in one part  the trajectory will first join/intersect the nullcline Ż =  <dig> and then following the nullcline until it reaches the fixed point. starting from an arbitrary point in the other region  the trajectory will only reach the nullcline in the fixed point ϕx >  <dig>  this qualitative difference in the trajectories gives rise to a different functional behaviours of the circuit ).

the system without input is determined by its fixed point ϕx =  <dig>  the circuit will exhibit a given dynamic behavior depending on which part of phase space ϕx =  <dig> is located. the location of the boundary between the two dynamical areas, termed separatrix, allows classifying the functionality of the trajectory. the key elements for the discrimination of the different possible functionalities, for a given geometry of the nullclines, is the relative position of three points: the crossing of the vertical nullcline Ẏ =  <dig> without input, with: i) the nullcline Ż =  <dig> without input , ii) the separatrix  and with iii) the nullcline Ż =  <dig> with input . we illustrate this with an example  in figure  where the relative positions of the crossing points and their implication for the time course is outlined. an analytical estimation of the separatrix and all the possible combinations of these elements with its resulting dynamics are presented in supplementary materials.

our analysis can be generally applied to all three-gene ffls. we have shown that both examples show enough plasticity in the dynamics to implement different type of response. in the next section we will focus on the probability of emergence of the different feasible types of dynamics.

probability of emergence of different ffl's dynamics
in the previous section we have shown that in both examples, c <dig> and i <dig>  more than one possible dynamic behavior can be obtained depending on the specific set of parameters chosen. generally we can list six types of dynamics, namely positive or negative graders  and positive or negative pulsers . grader response corresponds to an increase  or decrease  of the concentration of z characterized by a transient from the initial to the final state where the concentration of z never is higher  or lower  than the final concentration. in general, grader responses are related with responses able to filter noise and respond only on absolute certainty  <cit> . on the other hand, a pulser response is characterized by a rapid increase  or decrease  of the concentration of z reaching higher  or lower  values of z before they reach the final state. note that for the pulsers independently of the pulse direction  the final concentration of output protein z can be higher  or lower  than the initial concentration. hence we separately analyze four different pulser dynamics, namely p+, p+, p-, p-. the time courses of the different functionalities are outlined in figure . a specific subset of dynamics can be determined for each ffl frequently containing functions, which cannot be implemented. based on this results the main question is: are all the feasible dynamics equally probable? to address this question we have performed an analytical study of the parametric requirements necessary to implement a given type of dynamical response.

backbone of requirements for the ffl response
we can deduce geometrically all possible sets of trajectories. we discriminate the necessary parametric conditions for the emergence of one specific dynamic among all the possible, due to the relative position of the initial point ϕx =  <dig> of the trajectory in relation to the separatrix s, ξ and the specific shape of the nullclines. the parametric conditions, which determine the shape of the nullcline, can be systematically formalized. the key geometrical elements of the nullclines can be described by a set of exclusive parametric combinations defined in a string, which we call the backbone of requirements. each position in this sequence contains the solution for two possible parametric states.

the example shown in figure  is meant to illustrate the procedure. the cases in  display the same geometrical shape and can be described by a single backbone of requirements shown in . note that not all the elements of the parametric sequence need to be defined explicitly. in certain occasions some of them are uniquely defined by previous conditions, denoted by *, or otherwise do not have an impact on the geometrical scenario, represented by '∅'. for example position one is denoted '∅'. if condition two  is satisfied, position one is not relevant, because both solutions , provide the same geometry. on the other hand position four, denoted as '*', is always solved as '>', because it can be deduced from the second condition given that βx >  <dig> 

quantification of the dynamical probabilities
within the framework of our model, we assume that the feasibility of given dynamical behaviour  is heavily dependent on the number of exclusive, parametric configurations necessary for the realization of this behaviour. these are subsumed in the backbone of requirements. we have generated all possible backbone sequences for the circuits c <dig> and i <dig>  for each of these sequences the separatrix discriminates among different dynamics as we have shown in figure . in circuit c <dig> we have found  <dig> different sequences implementing five different types of dynamics, where as for circuit i <dig>   <dig> sequences implement four different behaviors. the detailed list of backbone sequences are shown in supplementary materials. the total number nc of possible requirements captured within one sequence i within a circuit k = {c <dig>  i1} is constant and follows the sum:

   

here,  represents the number of requirements having no impact on the nullclines' geometry. for this kind of elements of the sequence, both possible solutions  are valid and hence discrimination is unnecessary. therefore,  different combinations of parameters are described by the same backbone sequence providing the same geometry for the nullclines. the second term , is the number of elements predefined by other conditions of the backbone. finally,  is the number of requirement actually necessary to determine univocaly the shape of the nullcline. in other words, in order to implement a determined backbone sequence it is sufficient to properly establish the conditions .

once these conditions are set, the rest of the sequence is determined. this allows to calculate the probability for a given set of parameters to implement a certain backbone sequence i as

   

for a given ffl topology it is possible to find different sets of parameters compatible with such topology but implementing different dynamics among the six possibilities. each set of parameters fits in a specific backbone sequence. for each backbone sequence there exist three different relative positions of the separatrix discriminating among the different possible dynamics. this idea is illustrated in figure . the same backbone sequence shown in 7d can implement two different dynamics, namely g+and p+ t +. the location of the separatix shown in figures  depends on the numerical values of the parameters. if these specific values locate the separatrix as depicted in figure  the ffl motif will implement a grader dynamics, whereas other locations ) will provide a pulser dynamics. the probability of circuit k to implement a given dynamic j = {g+, g-, p+, p+, p-, p-} described by the backbone sequence i can, thus, be calculated as:

   

where Ψijk is the number of equal dynamical outcomes j for a given backbone i in the k-th ffl and tjk the total number of backbone sequences implementing dynamic j. the normalization constant Ωk is defined by imposing the condition  and gives:

   

by calculating the probability of implementation of the different types of dynamics for the different ffls we obtain an interesting picture regarding our initial question, whether the topology of the ffl implements its function. as shown in figure  the coherent ffl c <dig> implements five different types of dynamics. their probability  is however very different. we find that c <dig> is significantly specialized for g+ dynamics. the degree of specialization is equally reflected in its robustness versus parametric change. on the other hand, the incoherent ffl i <dig> potentially implements four different types of dynamics, as shown in figure . the probabilities for i <dig> to implement these functionalities are within the same range, unlike in c <dig>  in figure  the distribution of probabilities of c <dig>  obtained performing the same analysis is shown. the specific topology allows for flexibility at the cost of less specialization. we see that the topology of the ffl does not implement its function, but instead the probability of a certain function to arise. if, for a given ffl, the distribution accentuates a certain function, the ffl is said to be specialized for this function. if the probabilities are located within the same range, the topology implements flexibility. both aspects are equally relevant in terms of adaptation and evolvability.

the highest level of specialization of a given motif would correspond to a distribution of probabilities displaying a single peak, whereas the maximum level of flexibility would correspond to a flat distribution of probabilities, where all the potential dynamics would be equally probable. in order to compare the level of specialization of different ffl topologies we propose to measure the peakedness of the probability distribution, i.e. the kurtosis  <cit>  . the values of kurtosis are kc <dig> =  <dig> , kc <dig> =  <dig>  and ki <dig> =  <dig> , respectively indicating that c <dig> has an intermediate level of specialization with respect to c <dig>  and i <dig> . the same qualitative distributions are obtained by numerical simulation choosing random sets of parameters and counting the frequency of each dynamics .

CONCLUSIONS
ffl motifs appear frequently in cellular regulatory networks. despite the efforts devoted to understand how ffls encode their functionalities, the question about the relation exact between function and topology remained open. in this work we have presented a new analytical formalism based on the geometric analysis of the system's nullclines to elucidate this question. we found that the dynamical response triggered by the external input can be analysed in terms of: i) the nullcline's geometry as described by a backbone sequence of parametric conditions and ii) the specific location of the initial stable state in the phase space with respect to the nullclines and the separatrix. this puts us into the position to unambiguously enumerate the probability of a given ffl to implement a certain function. our results support this view topology does not define a unique functionality, as have been previously discussed, . circuits with the same topology can implement different functions, yet not all of these possible dynamics are equally probable. however, topology defines univocally the distribution of probabilities for the emergence of the different feasible responses.

for illustrative purposes we have analyzed two interesting examples, namely circuits c <dig> and i <dig>  exhibiting the same regulatory interactions except a single regulation of the gene gy by the protein x. in these cases we found two paradigmatic scenarios: circuit c <dig> can implement g+ response with significantly higher probability than the other feasible dynamics, whereas, i <dig> exhibit more uniform distribution of probabilities. these results demonstrate that c <dig> has a specialized topology, optimal for the implementation of grader response, whereas i <dig> has a high degree of flexibility among different dynamics. under an evolutionary perspective, a trade-off between these different features, flexibility and specialization, is likely to play an important role. this problem will be investigated elsewhere.

in single motif networks a given function will be implemented with high probability by the most specialized topology. however, in evolved, complex networks other aspects need to be considered. in order to obtain reliable networks, i.e. robust and with high fault tolerance, complex topologies can emerge as a result of the evolutionary process. an evolved and fit network is not necessarily the sum of its optimal sub-modules. in order to provide redundancy and degeneracy, flexible sub-modules, able to change their functionalities with minimal cost are often a good solution to reliability  <cit> . future work will be devoted to analyze the implications of these two characteristics in the natural emergence of current biological networks.
