BACKGROUND
since its first discovery in horses in  <dig>  <cit> , methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has clearly emerged as an important pathogen in equine clinics, causing both carriage  and infections in patients and personnel  <cit> . whether mrsa is also circulating in the equine population outside clinics, as in humans and livestock  <cit> , is however much less known. such carriage in the general population could be very important since colonized horses are at an increased risk of developing infections themselves and may spread the pathogen to other horses, animal species and their human caretakers  <cit> . current literature on the presence and extent of an equine mrsa reservoir at farm level is rather limited and demonstrates regional differences in carriage rates  and strain types  <cit> , a phenomenon typical for mrsa carriage  <cit> . on the european mainland, the colonization status of healthy horses outside clinics is largely unknown, with only two studies reporting on seemingly negative populations  <cit> .

at the beginning of the 2000s, mrsa belonging to the clonal complex   <dig> was isolated from pigs and pig farmers in the netherlands  <cit> . these so called livestock-associated-mrsa  strains are highly prevalent in pigs in european countries  <cit> . although pigs act as the main reservoir, la-mrsa cc <dig> has also been shown to be present in other food producing animals, including poultry  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> , and it has occasionally been detected in companion animals  <cit> . in horses, la-mrsa cc <dig> is currently regularly being detected in european equine clinics with up to 55% of hospitalized animals testing positive  <cit> .

in a previous study,  <dig> % of the horses arriving at an equine clinic in flanders, belgium, carried la-mrsa cc <dig> in their nose  <cit> . although it has been suggested that these horses might be representatives of the general population  <cit> , it cannot be excluded that patients arriving at a clinic represent a biased subpopulation. it was therefore the aim of the present study to assess if la-mrsa cc <dig> is really endemically present in the general horse population, by screening horses on horse farms for the occurrence of mrsa.

RESULTS
the screened horses were between  <dig> and  <dig> years of age  with  <dig>  of them being male  and  <dig>  being female. the sampling population existed of  <dig>  warmbloods,  <dig>  standardbreds,  <dig>  draft horses ,  <dig>  thoroughbreds  and  <dig>  others .

in total,  <dig> samples  from horses were gathered. from one horse no nasal swab and from four other horses, no perianal swab could be taken due to signs of resistance in the animals.

from one nasal swab, a mrsa isolate was obtained with a spa type t <dig> strain carrying a sccmecv cassette. mrsa was not isolated from any of the other samples. phenotypically, the obtained mrsa isolate showed acquired resistance to oxacillin and tetracycline.

the animal from which the mrsa isolate was obtained was a warmblood, breeding mare, housed at a breeding facility with about  <dig> horses.

discussion
in the present study, only  <dig> out of  <dig> horses from  <dig> different farms carried a typical representative of the la-mrsa cc <dig> clone. the farms were all situated in a region surrounding an equine clinic where shortly before, high carriage rates had been detected in arriving patients  <cit> . the fact that such a low presence of mrsa on farms was found in this study is rather surprising, and in contrast with the earlier described high carriage rate in horses arriving at the clinic. possible factors responsible for the higher carriership in equine patients admitted to a clinic may be previous antimicrobial administration, stress due to transportation, transport in contaminated vehicles and direct contact with referring veterinarians who might carry mrsa. large animal veterinarians are indeed considered to be at high risk of carrying the strains circulating in their main contact species  <cit> .

the finding that only one horse was found to be mrsa positive was all the more unexpected since the samples were collected on rather large  horse farms, which are more likely to harbor mrsa carriers  <cit>  and the study was performed in a region where the la-mrsa cc <dig> clone is highly prevalent in pigs, with high carriage rates detected at human, individual pig and farm level  <cit> . although contact of the horses in the current study with pigs was not assessed as such, it would not have been impossible for pig to horse transmission of cc <dig> to occur, especially given the long term environmental survival, potential airborne transmission of mrsa and the possibility of large animal veterinarians circulating between pig and horse farms  <cit> . in the current study, the only positive horse was a breeding mare housed on a breeding facility with consequent regular veterinary contact and a high number of horses present in the facility.

the low mrsa presence in the general horse population found here is in accordance with recent findings in the netherlands where the detection of high cc <dig> prevalences in livestock , equine clinics and veterinarians  <cit>  also stands opposite to a study detecting no mrsa in the general horse population  <cit> . both dutch and belgian data thus seem to classify equine cc <dig> carriage as a primarily veterinary-care associated problem with high detection rates only being found in horses arriving and residing at veterinary clinics. this difference in mrsa prevalence found between horse farms and intensive food production animal facilities seems unlikely to be due to differences in host adaptation given the substantial mrsa carriage found in equine clinics  <cit> . it could, however, be due to differences in husbandry between the examined horse farms and intensive animal husbandry in the same region. for instance, the animal density on horse farms is much lower and group medication  is virtually non-existing. in fact, the conditions encountered in equine clinics concur much more with those in intensive animal production and may thus, partially, explain the high mrsa prevalence encountered in equine clinics. common factors in the housing and husbandry of high prevalence sectors in the animal industry should probably be the first to scrutinize when examining potential risk factors for animal la-mrsa carriage. in addition to the nature of equine husbandry, a second factor may counteract the spread of la-mrsa in the general horse population. indeed, horses appear to be mainly transient carriers eliminating mrsa quickly  when removed from potential contamination sources  <cit> . if contaminated at clinic, they may thus quickly eliminate the bacterium when at home.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that the prevalence of equine la-mrsa is low on horse farms. continued monitoring is, however, advisable to avoid missing the potential future emergence of mrsa in the general, healthy horse population.
