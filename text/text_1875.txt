BACKGROUND
there is a rapid increase in the number of human immunodeficiency virus  infected individuals worldwide and so far we have met with little success in slowing down or preventing the progression of this pandemic disease. in order to use broadly neutralizing antibodies as effective reagents for passive immunotherapy to slow or to halt the disease progression in hiv- <dig> infected individuals and for immunogen design for vaccination to prevent the infection, the generation of large numbers of human hiv- <dig> specific monoclonal antibodies is desirable. although a few human broadly neutralizing antibodies  to hiv- <dig> exist 
 <cit> , these antibodies have limited reactivity against non-clade b viruses, which are responsible for more than 85% of the infections worldwide 
 <cit> . few bnabs exist so far, that are effective against the clade c viruses, which include the 4e <dig>  antibodies from the caprisa cohort and the recently isolated monoclonal antibodies pg <dig>  pg <dig> and vrc <dig> 
 <cit>  . in order to evaluate their utility in combating hiv- <dig> infection, and to tackle the problems posed by the extensive diversity of hiv- <dig>  it is essential to generate a large panel of human anti-hiv- <dig> antibodies of different specificities. further, it may be necessary to evaluate several antibodies to find rare but highly effective molecules.

the methods used for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma technology, recombinant technology by phage display and the recently employed techniques such as single b cell sorting followed by amplification of heavy and light chain genes 
 <cit> . generation of antibodies by the conventional hybridoma technology is not adequate enough to meet the challenge of assessing large numbers of human monoclonal antibodies from hiv- <dig> infected individuals at various stages of their clinical course. our approach to the problem has been to combine the antigen specific pre-selection of ebv transformed b cells with the construction of a phage library.

phage display is a scalable method for antibody production against a wide variety of antigens 
 <cit> . investigators are using this technology for the production of antibodies with the desired isotype specificities and affinity for research, clinical and industrial applications. antibody gene variable regions are amplified and expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage as a fusion protein 
 <cit>  and a number of antibodies can be produced from a single library and can be expressed and produced in a prokaryotic system. the major drawback in this technology is the requirement for the construction of large sized phage libraries  with an optimum diversity because the diversity of these libraries primarily determines the successful isolation of the desired antibodies. construction of such large libraries requires a number of ligation and electroporation reactions. screening of positive clones from these libraries generally require at least three to seven rounds of biopanning to select specifically binding clones 
 <cit> . it is also difficult to maintain such large sized libraries. keeping all these factors in mind we have described here a simple and efficient method for the production of human monoclonal antibodies using a combinational approach of ebv transformation, antigen preselection and phage display technology. a similar approach was previously used by kempf et al. to isolate fabs to the gp <dig> of hiv- <dig> 
 <cit> . here, we adopted a modified strategy and isolated for the first time, human anti-v <dig> scfvs from the ebv transformed lymphocytes of a clade c hiv- <dig> infected patient. this method can be used to produce large panels of viral specific phage libraries in less time and in a cost effective manner.

a limited number of monoclonal antibodies are generated against the hiv- <dig> clade c which is the most predominant subtype worldwide and in india 
 <cit> . the v <dig> region of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> is an important target to induce neutralizing antibodies against different strains of hiv- <dig>  it exhibits a high degree of sequence variability in the most structurally conserved region of the hiv- <dig> envelope 
 <cit>  and it interacts with the co-receptors ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig> 
 <cit> . in this study, we constructed a scfv library from the ebv transformed b cells of an hiv- <dig> infected patient # <dig>  reactive to the third variable  region of gp <dig> of hiv- <dig> clade c. the plasma sample of this patient was previously tested and found to exhibit cross neutralizing activity against a standard panel of pseudoviruses of different clades  and also had cross reactive binding antibodies to clade c and b v <dig> peptides 
 <cit> . the modified strategy used here employing ebv transformation; antigen preselection followed by phage library construction enabled the successful selection of human monoclonal recombinant scfvs specific to the v <dig> antigen of hiv- <dig>  construction of human scfv phage library from these antigen preselected b cells led to an efficient and cost effective approach for the production of anti-v <dig> scfvs.

RESULTS
viral neutralization and cross reactive binding activity of the patient plasma #254
the plasma antibodies of the hiv- <dig> infected patient # <dig> displayed neutralizing activity against  <dig> out of  <dig> hiv- <dig> viruses from subtype-a, b and c . the plasma sample also showed a cross subtype-b and c binding reactivity in context of the anti-v <dig> loop directed antibodies .

ebv transformation
a total of  <dig>  million pbmcs were isolated from the hiv-infected patient  and ebv transformed in  <dig> wells of a  <dig> well culture plate . after  <dig> weeks, the cultures were screened  for the presence of anti-v <dig> antibodies and 7/ <dig> wells showed high v <dig> binding reactivity with od>  <dig>  cells from these  <dig> v <dig> positive wells were expanded to a  <dig> well plate and after a second screening, cells from  <dig> out of  <dig> wells showing v <dig> binding with od >  <dig>  were expanded in a six-well plate, pooled and finally transferred to a t-  <dig> flask. in the 3rd  screening of the cells in the flask, the cells showed high reactivity to v <dig>  . these v <dig> positive  cells were processed for recombinant anti-v <dig> scfv generation.

 <dig> pbmcs were isolated from a hiv positive drug naïve patient sample . a total of  <dig>  million pbmcs were isolated.

 <dig> number of cells plated per well was  <dig> 

 <dig> forty eight wells were subjected to ebv transformation.

 <dig> all the  <dig> wells were successfully transformed .

 <dig> 7/ <dig> wells showed positive binding  with v <dig> peptide and expanded to  <dig> well stage.

 <dig> 5/ <dig>  wells showed positive binding  with v <dig> peptide and pooled down and grown in t- <dig> flask.

 <dig> final screening for anti-v <dig> antibody binding reactivity was done at flask stage .

phage library construction
total rna from the v <dig> enriched antibody producing b cells of the patient # <dig> was isolated. a total of 200ng of rna was reverse transcribed to cdna. use of random hexamer and oligo dt in the cdna synthesis process was shown to be more effective than either of them alone or the 3′ primers 
 <cit> . it also enhanced the chances of amplification of the antibody genes even when the amount of rna is low 
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> combinations were used to amplify the heavy and light chains . among the  <dig> combinations of heavy chains,  <dig> were successfully amplified. the heavy chains vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vh <dig> and vh <dig> were preferentially more expressed while vh <dig> and vh <dig> were very less expressed . all the  <dig> kappa light chain combinations were successfully amplified and expressed almost at the same level, except for vlk <dig>  which were relatively less expressed . a heavy chain and light chain pool was made by mixing equal concentration of each combination  irrespective of their expression level, so that each combination of the heavy chain has an equal probability to combine with the light chain and vice versa and to avoid the predominant expression of one antibody subclass and finally to have new combinations of antibodies for a particular antigen that are naturally not elicited during the natural course of infection. a final pull through pcr was performed using the forward and reverse primers. these scfvs were then ligated into the pcantab-5e vector that contains the sfi <dig> and noti sites . the ligated product was transformed into tg <dig> using calcium chloride mediated transformation. the incubation time after the heat shock treatment during transformation was maintained for a maximum of  <dig> min to avoid repetition of similar types of clones in the library. we obtained 200– <dig> transformed colonies per plate. a total of  <dig> colonies were obtained with 400ng of digested scfv dna that were ligated into  <dig> μg of phagemid vector. the ligated dna was transformed into e.coli tg <dig> 

diversity of the phage antibody library
to check the diversity of antibodies in the library, we randomly selected  <dig> clones from the unselected library. amplification of these  <dig> scfvs by pcr, followed by digestion with bstn <dig> and comparing their dna fingerprint patterns showed that 9/ <dig> clones were distinct from each other. clone  <dig> and clone  <dig> showed identical dna fingerprinting patterns .

we further confirmed the diversity of the antibody fragments by dna sequence analysis of  <dig> randomly selected scfv clones from the unselected library which showed high diversity of clones i.e. 73%  in the library. the heavy chain  sequences showed a limited diversity, igvh <dig>  and igvh <dig>  were the most preferentially represented vh sequences that combined with all the representatives of ighd genes except for ighd <dig>  diversity of the vl paratope was also limited with igkv <dig>  igkv <dig> and igkv <dig> being most represented, except for one occurrence of igkv <dig> .

identical sequences of clones  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are shown in italic.

selection of scfvs against the v <dig> region of hiv-1
as the size of the library was very small, one round of biopanning was done against the v <dig> c and v <dig> b peptides. forty clones were randomly selected and checked for their binding, of which  <dig> showed positivity in phage elisa with both the peptides . four clones were randomly selected for elisa with purified phage. the binding specificity of these anti-v <dig> scfvs was checked with phage from the  <dig> well plate and peg precipitated purified phage. the  <dig> well elisa and pure phage elisa binding assays showed similar results. three clones exhibited almost similar binding in both the formats of elisa while one clone had lower binding reactivity in pure phage elisa although it was not completely lost . dna fingerprinting analysis using bstn <dig> followed by sequencing revealed that 13/ <dig> clones were distinct . all the distinct  <dig> anti -v <dig> scfvs that were finally selected, showed cross-reactivity against both the v <dig> peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides. one round of biopanning was found to be sufficient to get v <dig> positive scfv clones with diversity.

this table shows the gene usage of the ten anti-v <dig> scfvs. nine out of the ten sequences are distinct. clones 3c3c and 3e7b show similar gene usage which are shown in italic.

soluble scfv production
the antigen binding clones showing positivity/binding in the phage elisa were further processed for soluble scfv expression by induction with 1mm iptg 
 <cit> . after induction, the periplasmic lysate, inclusion bodies, culture supernatant and whole cell extract were prepared and analysed for scfv expression on a 12% reducing sds-page. the scfv fusion protein was found to be expressed in the cell lysate, culture supernatant, periplasmic extract, with highest expression in the inclusion bodies. scfv expression was also observed in the uninduced culture .

purification of e-tagged scfv and western blot analysis
the scfvs were expressed in e. coli hb <dig> cells by inducing for  <dig> to  <dig> h with  <dig> mm iptg at 24°c. the antibody fragments were purified from the periplasmic extract and the purified product was analysed by sds-page. the scfv protein of 32kda was expressed in different elute fractions e <dig> to e <dig>  and protein samples were concentrated using ultrafiltration columns  over a 10kda cut off.

expression of the scfv fusion protein  in the periplasmic extract was confirmed by western blotting. the cell lysate of hb <dig> was used as a negative control .

validation of antigen binding of the scfv clones
the functional activity of the newly generated clones 3e6b and 3e7b was assessed by their binding to the v <dig> peptides of clade c and b in elisa. both the scfvs showed specific binding to the v <dig> peptides . in addition, these scfvs did not bind to other unrelated peptides like mper and id loop of hiv, peptide pool  and bsa.

neutralization potential of anti-v <dig> scfvs
the purified scfvs were tested for the viral neutralization potential against a panel of pseudoviruses from clades a, b and c hiv- <dig> viruses . clone 3e6b was able to neutralize 1/ <dig> clade a, 2/ <dig> clade b and 1/ <dig> clade c viruses. the other clone 3e7b was only able to neutralize  <dig> clade c virus.

the cross neutralizing activities of two anti-v <dig> scfv clones against a panel of subtype-a, b, c viruses that are listed on the left. the numerical values in the table represent the concentration  of scfvs at which 50% neutralization titers  was reached. aiims  <dig> is the primary isolate generated in our lab from a hiv- <dig> clade c infected patient. scfv  is an scfv against the hepatitis b surface antigen  and  <dig> is human antibody to parvovirus . each experiment was performed at least two independent times.

discussion
we have demonstrated in this study a strategy that successfully yielded recombinant human scfvs against the v <dig> region of hiv- <dig> using a pool of antigen selected ebv transformed b lymphocytes and phage display technology. the use of preselected b cells producing anti- v <dig> antibodies for phage scfv library construction proved to be an efficient strategy for the isolation of v <dig> specific clones. moreover, this approach has prevented any loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have useful and unique binding specificities .

stringency during the initial stages helps in elimination of most of the false positive clones. beginning with the  <dig> well stage and up to the final screening of the cells in the t <dig> flask, we selected only those wells with high v <dig> binding reactivity for further expansion and finally for the phage library construction. by this approach, we obtained a phage library with an adequate number of v <dig> binding clones. amplification of the heavy chain gene showed that the vh <dig>  vh <dig>  vh <dig> and vh <dig> were preferentially more expressed than the vh <dig> and vh <dig> and corroborated with the previous reports 
 <cit>  that anti-v <dig> antibodies more preferentially exhibit the above gene usages. it is well established that in hiv- <dig> infection, vh <dig> genes are less preferentially used 
 <cit> . from the sequencing data, we observed that twenty nine randomly selected clones from the ebv transformed cells library exhibited the vh <dig> and vh <dig> gene usage suggesting that our library may be biased towards antigen specificity. in healthy individuals, vh <dig> genes are most frequently used and vh <dig> is used only by a low percentage of antibodies . the light chain did not show any preferential gene usage and all the light chains were successfully amplified.

as heavy chain amplification was biased towards the expression of a set of heavy chain genes, to avoid predominant expression of one subset of genes in the phage library, we took an equal concentration of all the heavy chain genes which in turn increased the chances of the new combinations that are not expressed in natural infection. successful isolation of positive clones with higher affinity and specificity is possible when a library is more diverse and has less number of clones with incomplete scfvs sequences 
 <cit> . if phage carrying incomplete scfvs are more in number, they overwhelm the library after multi-step panning thereby the presence of the full size insert will decrease, this being a common problem with phage libraries. interestingly, our library exhibited 90% diversity of clones and 100% clones had complete scfvs , this might be because of the optimum incubation time  maintained during the transformation process that reduced the chances of repetition of clones. in addition, the combination of the sfi1- noti site containing pcantab-5e vector that we used in the library construction may have reduced or eliminated the chances of getting incomplete scfv sequences because these restriction enzyme sites are rarely present in the scfv dna sequence 
 <cit> . furthermore, none of our clones had internal sfi1- noti sites.

stringency in the biopanning also reduces the number of false positive clones. initially, phage were allowed to bind to the plastic plate, next, to coated milk, followed by bsa and finally onto a pool of coated unrelated antigens in the plates. this stringency reduced the number of non-specific phage binders and made the screening process more convenient and specific.

kempf et al., using a similar strategy of ebv transformation, constructed a fab library of  <dig> clones from which they isolated three fabs after one round of biopanning. their scoring of positive clones however was less, probably because they selected cells positive for gp <dig> binding from the  <dig> well stage and also included wells that were low binders  
 <cit> . we therefore selected only those wells with high v <dig> binding reactivity  at all stages for the phage library construction. this reduced the number of false positive clones and enriched the v <dig> specific cells.

there are several reports on the generation of scfvs from different sources like pbmcs 
 <cit> , bone marrow 
 <cit> , tonsils 
 <cit> , hybridomas 
 <cit> , but none of them employed ebv transformed antigen specific cells to generate a scfv phage library.

generation of phage library from ebv transformed lines after preselection with antigen is very useful for laboratories with limited resources because the antibody production by traditional hybridoma technology costs ranging between $ <dig> to $ <dig> and 80% of the costs are incurred in the post ebv immortalization steps like fusions and cloning. our strategy does not require the expensive process of electroporation because the cost of cuvettes and instrument mainly limits the construction of phage libraries with such a large size and diversity; also it eliminates the large number of biopanning rounds followed by cumbersome screening processes. such small libraries are easy to maintain and can be produced by routinely used calcium chloride mediated transformations.

CONCLUSIONS
we have for the first time, generated anti-v <dig> human scfvs against clade c hiv- <dig>  by antigen pre-selection, the phage library served as an adequate source of v <dig> positive clones. the combination of ebv transformation and selection of immortalized lines that exhibit the desired antigen binding characteristics with phage display technology provides a useful strategy for specific recombinant antibody generation. our study validated the generation of recombinant libraries as a powerful tool for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies.
