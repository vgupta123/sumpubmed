BACKGROUND
arvicoline rodents  represent a muroid lineage that split from the lineage leading to mus and rattus ~ <dig> million years ago   <cit> . amongst voles, the microtus genus includes approximately  <dig> extant species that are primarily distributed across north america and eurasia  <cit> . based on fossil evidence, all members of the microtus genus are hypothesized to be derived from a common ancestor that lived just ~ <dig> mya  <cit>  and it has been noted that the rate of speciation required to generate  <dig> species in such a short time-frame are likely to have been at least 20-fold higher than expected in a typical mammalian lineage  <cit> . consistent with this rapid rate of speciation, vole genomes display signatures of elevated rates of evolution. for example, in a european vole, m. rossiaemeridionalis, the mitochondrial genome appears to be evolving at a higher rate than all other mammalian taxa examined  <cit> , and integrations of mitochondrial dna  into the european vole nuclear genome have occurred at a much higher rate than in either mice or rats  <cit> . in addition, the diploid karyotypes of microtus voles are quite variable and range from 2n = 17- <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that many chromosomal rearrangements have been fixed in a very short amount of time. indeed, maruyama and imai determined that microtus had the highest rate of karyotype alterations when compared to other rodents  <cit> . finally, this genus is highly enriched for unusual genomic and genetic properties associated with the x chromosome . together, these unusual features of the microtus genomes make them a promising model for the study of genome evolution.

in addition to possessing intriguing genomic features, a north american vole species, the prairie vole , has become an important animal model for understanding the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to variation in social behaviors  <cit> . unlike more traditional mammalian model organisms  and rat ), prairie voles are highly affiliative, socially monogamous, form enduring social bonds between mates  and display extensive biparental care of offspring  <cit> . comparative studies between the socially monogamous prairie vole and other closely related, non-monogamous, uniparental vole species within the genus microtus have led to the identification of key genes and neurocircuitry that differentiate the social repertoires of these species. for example, the neuropeptide vasopressin is known to be involved in the regulation of social behavior in a variety of mammals  <cit> . however, comparative studies of monogamous and non-monogamous vole species led to the discovery that the distribution and density of vasopressin 1a receptors  within the reward and reinforcement circuitry of the brain, but not the peptide itself, underlies differences between these species in a male's propensity to form pair bonds or to engage in parental care  <cit> . furthermore, a length polymorphism in a microsatellite upstream of the transcription start site of avpr1a, the gene encoding v1ar, is associated with the differential expression of v1ar in prairie voles  <cit> . these and other findings gleaned from prairie vole research have already yielded remarkable parallels between the genetic regulation of social cognition and behavior in voles and man  <cit> , and future studies in the prairie vole promise to further advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of human social behavior.

despite the tremendous value of the prairie vole as a candidate species to begin to understand the unique features of genome evolution within the genus microtus and as a model system for studying the relationship between the genome and the brain in generating social behaviors, a lack of genomic resources has limited the potential of this extraordinary model system. here we report the development of a pair of genomic resources for the prairie vole: a prairie vole bacterial artificial chromosome  library, and a first-generation prairie vole-mouse comparative cytogenetic map.

RESULTS
bac library construction and characterization
dna extracted from a kidney of a single male prairie vole was used to generate a bac library consisting of  <dig>  recombinant clones. estimates of the insert size from a sample of clones from the library indicated that average insert size was  <dig> kb and that the vast majority of clones contain inserts in the 100- <dig> kb size range. further information as to the insert size distribution and other library properties can be found online at http://bacpac.chori.org/library.php?id= <dig>  assuming a genome size typical for placental mammals, ~ <dig>  gb, the theoretical genome coverage of this library is ~ <dig> ×. to experimentally verify the clone-depth of the library and its utility for targeted physical mapping, we screened the library with n =  <dig> probes from  <dig> discrete locations in the genome corresponding to genes that have been established to be associated with social behavior in voles, or other species . based on probe-content and restriction-enzyme fingerprint bac contigs at the targeted loci we observed an average clone depth of  <dig> ×, which is very close to the depth of coverage predicted for the library.

generation and characterization of prairie vole bac-end sequences
to initiate a small-scale sequence survey of the prairie vole genome we attempted to generate bac-end sequences  from all clones corresponding to library plates #1- <dig>  as well as those clones identified in the above targeted mapping efforts. in total,  <dig> successful bess were generated with an average quality-trimmed read length of  <dig> bp. similar to other rodent genomes  <cit> , the gc content of the prairie vole genome estimated based on the ~ <dig>  mb of bes data was  <dig> %. the repetitive element content of the prairie vole bess as determined by repeatmasker http://www.repeatmasker.org was just  <dig> %, which is much lower than the ~42% repeat content observed other rodents  <cit> . however, the low observed repeat content in prairie voles compared to other rodents most likely reflects an inability to identify vole-specific repeats rather than a true compositional difference between the genomes. finally, we did not detect any evidence of numt elements within the bess, suggesting that while integration and duplication of these elements in the microtus genome are elevated compared to other species  <cit> , they are not a common wide-spread feature of the prairie vole genome.

comparative mapping of prairie vole bac-end sequences
to begin to develop a prairie vole-mouse comparative map, we compared the prairie vole bess to the mouse genome. overall, we were able to map 33%  of the prairie vole bess to a unique location in the mouse genome. as a result,  <dig> vole clones were anchored to the mouse genome via a single bes and an additional  <dig> vole clones via both bess . of the clones in which both bess mapped to the mouse genome the majority  were classified as concordant, and therefore could be definitively assigned to a single orthologous location in the mouse genome. another  <dig> clones that were classified as discordant because the distance between the paired bess was smaller  or greater  than expected based on the bac insert sizes, presumably due to local insertions or deletions, could also be assigned to a single orthologous location in the mouse genome. the remaining vole clones with discordant mapping results were associated with two potential large  indels or complex rearrangements, three potential inversions, and  <dig> potential translocations. however, because each potential rearrangement between the prairie vole and mouse genomes detected by this method are only supported by one or two bes mate-pairs these results should be considered provisional evidence for the location of structural differences between the prairie vole and mouse genomes. finally, after taking into account the relative size of the assembled mouse chromosomes and the fact that the library was made from a male, the observed chromosomal distribution of mapped prairie vole bess generated from library plates 1- <dig>  did not differ significantly from a random distribution expected by chance .

construction of a first generation prairie vole-mouse comparative cytogenetic map
to generate a first generation prairie vole-mouse comparative map, we selected a set of  <dig> vole clones that were optimally spaced  across the genome  and hybridized them to metaphase chromosome spreads from a male prairie vole. though there was a significant hybridization failure rate amongst the clones , prairie vole bacs orthologous to all mouse chromosomes with the exception of the y, were represented in the comparative map, and at least one clone mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> vole autosomes and the x chromosome . of the  <dig> clones for which distinct hybridization signals were observed, most  fell into groups of 2- <dig> probes that defined blocks of conserved synteny that ranged in size from ~ <dig> mb between vole and mouse chromosomes  <dig>  to ~ <dig> mb between the vole and mouse x chromosomes . the most extensive conserved synteny was observed between prairie vole chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  x and mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x, respectively, in which all the mapped probes were linked to a single chromosome in both species. among those and other instances of conserved synteny that were defined by 3- <dig> markers, the relative order of the markers was also conserved  on prairie vole chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, the relative order of markers differed between vole chromosomes and mouse chromosomes  <dig> and the x chromosomes, consistent with at least one inversion having occurred on both chromosomes since the most recent common ancestor of these rodents. in addition, the interdigitated order of markers orthologous to different mouse chromosomes on prairie vole chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were indicative of a minimum of one and two inversions, respectively being associated with those chromosomes .

inter-chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since the most-recent common ancestor of the prairie vole and mouse will have disrupted the physical linkage between markers resulting in orthology of a single prairie vole or mouse chromosome to two or more chromosomes in the other species. the most extreme examples of the evolutionary shuffling of the genome at the inter-chromosomal level were mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  each of which mapped to three vole chromosomes, and mouse chromosome  <dig>  which mapped to four vole chromosomes . conversely, vole chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mapped to three mouse chromosomes each. to estimate the number of chromosomal rearrangements that would be necessary to generate the differences we observed between the genomes at this level of comparison we applied the grimm algorithm  <cit>  to our comparative mapping data set. this method identified the five inversions described above, as well as  <dig> additional inter-chromosomal rearrangements, as the minimum number of rearrangements that would be needed to transform the marker order and chromosomal linkage in the prairie vole to that observed in the mouse genome. previously it had been reported that there were fewer chromosomal rearrangements between the rat and deer mouse genomes compared to the mouse and deer mouse genomes  <cit> . as the prairie vole and deer mouse are sister species with respect to mouse and rat, we also used the grimm algorithm to estimate the minimum number of rearrangements detected in our data set between the prairie vole and rat. for the prairie vole-rat comparison in which the orthologous positions of the mapped prairie vole bac clones in the rat genome were indirectly inferred via their orthologous location in the mouse genome using the ucsc genome browser 'convert' option  <cit> , the grimm algorithm estimated a total of  <dig> rearrangements  between the prairie vole and rat. thus, though the number of markers included in our comparative maps is relatively small, these observations suggest that the mouse genome could be a better reference for predicting the location of genes in the prairie vole genome versus the rat genome.

discussion
the prairie vole is an exceptional model of social behavior and is a member of a genus that has been associated with rapid evolution and atypical genomic features. the experimentally validated bac library reported here will be a valuable resource for dissecting the genetic basis of social behavior and more generally, evaluating patterns and rates of evolution within microtus. in particular, we have shown that the bac library can be used for targeted comparative mapping of genes and regions of interest. clones isolated from the library can be used for detailed cytogenetic mapping within and between microtus voles, as well as templates for targeted genomic sequencing. in addition, the bac-end sequencing described here is already being used to support the genome-wide identification of polymorphic genetic markers, such as snps and microsatellites, and global end-sequencing of the library would support the planned future high-quality assembly of the prairie vole genome http://www.genome.gov/ <dig>  finally, the bac library is also a resource for developing prairie vole bac transgenic mice, or in the future transgenic voles  <cit> , both of which will serve as powerful tools to experimentally validate the role of specific genes or alleles have in modifying social behavior.

previous studies indicated that microtus genomes are evolving rapidly  <cit> . due to the relatively low resolution of our prairie vole-mouse comparative map, it is not possible to rigorously quantify the rate of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred in the prairie vole versus mouse lineages. for example, even though a minimum of  <dig> chromosomal rearrangements must have occurred to explain the differences in linkage between the mapped prairie vole bac clones and their orthologous positions in the mouse genome, the most parsimonious evolutionary history for only four of those rearrangements could be reconstructed , and of those, an equal number are predicted to have occurred in the prairie vole and mouse lineages. nevertheless, it is worth noting that as has been observed in comparisons between other mammalian genomes  <cit> , conserved synteny was detected between the prairie vole and mouse genomes, although the low resolution of our current comparative map would not be able to detect changes in gene order within the regions of conserved synteny, nor the precise size of those regions. thus, the gene linkage in the mouse, or other assembled rodent genomes, can be used as a reasonable estimate for inferring gene linkage in the prairie voles. future studies comparing the genomes of the prairie vole and other rodents, including mouse, rat, and deer mouse, that utilize the bac library reported here  will facilitate the comprehensive characterization of the unique genomic features that have been of long-standing interest in the microtus genus.

CONCLUSIONS
the prairie vole has emerged as a powerful model organism to study the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of social behaviors. as genetic studies in prairie voles and related vole species within the genus microtus have been limited to a handful of candidate genes, the bac library and the prairie vole-mouse comparative cytogenetic map that we describe here are an essential first step towards the development of a comprehensive suite of genomic resources for this species. these resources will be of enormous value for identifying new genes involved in social behaviors and in developing molecular and genetic tools to study the relationships between the genome, the brain and social behaviors. in addition, these resources provide a platform to further explore the unique aspects of genome evolution within the genus microtus relative to other rodent lineages.
