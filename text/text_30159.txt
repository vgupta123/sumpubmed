BACKGROUND
environmental stresses or abiotic constraints such as salinity, drought, heavy metals and low temperature are major obstacles to plant survival and development in many places worldwide. plant responses and adaptations to abiotic stresses are complex  <cit> . many cellular and physiological processes such as signal perception and transduction  <cit> , regulation of transcription, membrane trafficking, energy metabolism  <cit> , and protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are involved in plants’ toleration of excessive salt and drought stresses. several studies on drought and salt stresses using microarrays, transcriptome sequencing, and microrna sequencing  have identified stress-inducible genes involved in water transport , ion transport  h+-atpase, na+/h+ exchanger or na+/h+ antiporter), cellular membrane integrity , scavenging of free oxygen radicals , and protecting macromolecules . other proteins, such as regulatory proteins , were found to be involved in signal transduction  <cit> . aba-dependent and aba-independent signaling pathways were induced by plants in response to stress  <cit> . the aba-dependent transcription factors include myc/myb and aba-responsive element binding/aba-binding factor . the aba-independent transcription factors include dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins , c-repeat/drought-responsive element , and crt/dre-binding factor   <cit> . other transcription factors responding to abiotic stress conditions are zinc-finger proteins  <cit> , basic-domain leucine-zipper   <cit> , wrky  <cit> , and nacs  <cit> .

the development of next-generation sequencing technology  has led to major progress in understanding plant responses to drought and salt stress . some recent efforts include tissue-selective signaling and hormone crosstalk in response to salt and osmotic stresses and, recently, the dynamics of transcriptional networks that are functional at the seedling stage in response to water stress in gossypium arboreum  <cit> . the transcriptional characteristics of genes related to the reactive oxygen species -scavenging system are important to the salt tolerance of reaumuria trigyna  <cit> . further, genome-wide gene-expression profiling was used to examine the molecular mechanism and physiological response of gossypium herbaceum to drought  <cit> . thumma et al.  <cit>  used rna sequencing  to study the effect of water stress on gene expression in eucalyptus camaldulensis seedlings derived from three natural populations. rna-seq technology and its applications have dramatically accelerated plant-genomics research, including high-throughput sequencing of non-model-plant transcriptomes and large-scale genome-wide expression analysis.

caragana korshinskii is a leguminous shrub with highly developed root systems and strong stress tolerance  <cit>  that is commonly found in arid and semi-arid lands in northwestern china and mongolia  <cit> . therefore, c. korshinskii is widely planted in china to prevent desertification and improve vegetation coverage. the effect of drought or salt stress on plant gene expression has been intensely studied in numerous species including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat   <cit> , and sorghum bicolor  <cit> . in c. korshinskii, some investigations have focused on growth properties, nutritive characteristics, evapotranspiration, and genetic diversity , and several drought- and salt-stress-response genes have already been characterized , but there have been no studies on the stress-signaling pathways. this lack of molecular studies is a significant obstacle to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying drought or salt adaptation in c. korshinskii.

in this study, we generated transcriptome datasets to explore the salt- and drought-tolerance mechanisms of c. korshinskii using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. the main objectives of this study are to identify genes showing transcriptional differences and to identify their putative functions, as well as to identify genes putatively unique to c. korshinskii compared to the model plant arabidopsis and describe the patterns in their transcript abundance under salt- and drought-treated conditions. the assembled, annotated transcriptome data and differential expression profiles will facilitate further genetic and genomics studies on the molecular mechanisms of salt and drought tolerance in c. korshinskii and most likely in other leguminous plants.

functional annotation and analysis
among the  <dig>  transcripts, the direction could be determined for  <dig> . altogether,  <dig>   contigs were successfully annotated in the nr, go, kegg, cog, swiss-prot and interproscan databases. these contigs are listed in additional file  <dig>  of these,  <dig>   of  <dig>  contigs had significant matches in the nr database,  <dig>   contigs aligned to the kegg database,  <dig>   contigs matched go annotations, and  <dig>  contigs were similar to proteins in the interproscan database . because of the lack of genome and est information for c. korshinskii,  <dig>  %  of the contigs did not match any known genes in the database .

after blast2go analysis, the contigs were classified into  <dig> terms from three ontologies involved in cellular components, biological processes, and molecular function . in each of the three main go classifications , “metabolic process”, “cell” or “cell part”, and “catalytic activity” were dominant among the returned terms. based on a comparison to the kegg database,  <dig>   of the  <dig>  annotated contigs had significant matches and were thus assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the most-represented pathways were “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “ribosome” , “purine metabolism” , and “plant hormone signal transduction” . a total of  <dig>  contigs showed a cog classification. among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for “general function prediction only”  was the largest, followed by “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” , “signal transduction mechanisms” , “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” , and “transcription” . the categories “cell motility” , and “nuclear structure”  had the fewest corresponding genes .fig.  <dig> histogram of gene ontology  classification. contigs with the best blast hits were aligned to the go database. a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   contigs of c. korshinskii were classified into  <dig> terms from three ontologies involving cellular components, biological processes, and molecular function. the right y-axis indicates number of contigs in a category. the left y-axis represents the percentage of a specific category of contigs in the main category

analysis of differential expression of assembled c. korshinskii transcripts under drought and salt treatments
compared with the control,  <dig> and  <dig> contigs were classified as differentially expressed genes  in drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii, respectively . in the drought-treated seedlings,  <dig> contigs showed increased transcript abundance and  <dig> contigs showed decreased transcript abundance. in the salt-treated seedlings,  <dig> transcripts were upregulated and  <dig> transcripts were downregulated .fig.  <dig> identification of degs between drought-  and salt-  treated c. korshinskii. degs were filtered using fdr ≤ <dig>  and the absolute value of log2ratio ≥ <dig> as the threshold. red spots represent upregulated degs, and blue spots indicate downregulated degs. black spots represent contigs that did not show obvious changes in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii


fig.  <dig> venn diagrams illustrate the degs under drought and salt treatment in c. korshinskii. the red and blue colors represent the upregulated and downregulated transcripts under drought treatment, respectively. the yellow and green colors represent the upregulated and downregulated transcripts under salt treatment, respectively



venn-diagram analysis revealed the specificity and overlap among differentially expressed genes . among  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes, numerous genes overlapped in expression in response to the salt and drought treatments. for example, in drought- and salt-treated plants,  <dig> upregulated transcripts overlapped and  <dig> downregulated transcripts overlapped. in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> contigs appeared only in salt-treated samples, while  <dig> of  <dig> contigs were expressed only in drought-treated samples.

go annotation and statistical analyses demonstrated that  <dig> tested degs  were classified into three go ontologies and  <dig> terms in drought-treated plants. of these degs,  <dig> were associated with biological processes,  <dig> with cellular components, and  <dig> with molecular function. among these go categories, “oxidoreductase activity” , “oxidation-reduction process” , and “response to stress”  were significantly enriched among degs compared to the whole transcriptome background. in the molecular-function category,  <dig> tested degs  were enriched in  <dig> terms in salt-treated samples. the overwhelming majority of the genes with differential expression between the control and salt-treated conditions were also related to “oxidoreductase activity” , “oxidation-reduction process” , and “response to stress” . approximately  <dig>  % of  <dig> go terms in drought-treated c. korshinskii were also found in salt-treated c. korshinskii, such as oxidoreductase activity, oxidation-reduction process, electron carrier activity, and monooxygenase activity .

a total of  <dig> degs that were significantly upregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii were categorized into  <dig> go terms based on sequence similarity. accordingly,  <dig> significantly downregulated degs were categorized into  <dig> go terms . in addition,  <dig> go terms were found in two samples, including extracellular region, monooxygenase activity, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, iron ion binding, electron carrier activity and heme binding. interestingly,  <dig> degs were classified into the category “iron ion binding” and  <dig> degs into the category “electron carrier activity” out of  <dig> upregulated degs in drought-treated c. korshinskii. another  <dig> degs were classified into the category “iron ion binding” and  <dig> degs into the “electron carrier activity” among  <dig> downregulated degs in drought-treated c. korshinskii . a total of  <dig> degs that were upregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii were assigned to go classes with  <dig> functional terms. accordingly,  <dig> degs that were significantly downregulated were categorized into  <dig> go terms . generally,  <dig> go terms, such as structural constituent of ribosome, extracellular region, ribosome, translation, heme binding, and oxidation-reduction process, were found in both samples. furthermore,  <dig> degs were classified into the category “oxidation-reduction process” in  <dig> upregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii, and  <dig> degs were classified into the category “oxidation-reduction process”, out of  <dig> degs in salt-treated c. korshinskii, which were are valuable for studying salt-treated c. korshinskii .fig.  <dig> go categories of the degs in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii. degs with the best blast hits were aligned to the go database. each bar represents the percentage and number of degs mapped to each go category. the color indicates degs that were upregulated or downregulated in drought-  or salt-  treated c. korshinskii: red for upregulated degs and green for downregulated degs. the right y-axis indicates number of contigs in a category. the left y-axis represents the percentage of a specific category of contigs in the main category



in our analysis,  <dig> tested degs from drought-treated samples mapped to  <dig> pathways , with most mapping to “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism” , “starch and sucrose metabolism” , and “cysteine and methionine metabolism” . in salt-treated samples,  <dig> degs were enriched in  <dig> metabolic pathways. the most-enriched metabolic pathways were “ribosome” , “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” , and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” . among these metabolic pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, metabolic pathways, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, linoleic-acid metabolism, and the ribosome were enriched in both drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii .

in drought-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> upregulated degs were aligned with the kegg database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the most enriched metabolic pathways were “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “starch and sucrose metabolism”  and “cysteine and methionine metabolism” . in addition,  <dig> downregulated degs were enriched in  <dig> metabolic pathways . most of these unigenes were sorted to “metabolic pathways” , “photosynthesis”  and “porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism”  . in salt-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> upregulated degs mapped to  <dig> categories of kegg , including “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”  and “ribosome” . interestingly,  <dig> degs were assigned to the “peroxisome” pathway. meanwhile,  <dig> downregulated degs were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the pathways with the highest number of degs were “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”  and “phenylalanine metabolism” . the candidate functional genes that were differentially expressed in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii were analyzed . many genes that were upregulated or downregulated in response to drought or salt stress in c. korshinskii were reported to be involved in multiple mechanisms that might contribute to drought or salt tolerance. among those functional genes,  <dig> contigs were upregulated and  <dig> contigs were downregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii, whereas  <dig> contigs were upregulated and  <dig> contigs were downregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii.fig.  <dig> kegg pathways analysis of the degs in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii. in drought-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> upregulated degs were enriched in kegg pathways , and  <dig> downregulated degs were enriched in metabolic pathways . in salt-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> upregulated degs were mapped to kegg categories , and  <dig> downregulated degs were assigned to kegg pathways . the left y-axis indicates the number of degs in a kegg pathway. the right y-axis represents the percentage of a specific category of degs in the pathway



functional genes related to protein kinase
we identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts predicted to encode protein kinases , of which  <dig> and  <dig> contigs encoding receptor-like protein kinase were differentially expressed in drought-treated and salt-treated libraries, respectively. among these receptor-like protein kinases,  <dig> and seven contigs predicted to encode leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like protein kinase were differentially expressed in response to drought stress and salt stress. among these contigs, cko_contig_ <dig>  cko_contig_ <dig> and cko_contig_ <dig> were upregulated more than 32-fold under drought stress.fig.  <dig> transcriptional characteristics of degs related to protein kinase. the  <dig> points  from left to right on the x-axis represent contigs encoding protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding receptor-like protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding lectin receptor-like kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding proline-rich receptor-like protein kinase under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding tyrosine-protein kinase-like under drought  or salt stress , contigs encoding protein kinase c under drought  or salt stress , and contigs encoding ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase under drought  or salt stress . blue bar represents upregulated degs; red bar indicates downregulated degs



we further identified  <dig> contigs responsible for mitogen-activated protein kinases, of which two contigs  were upregulated dramatically by drought or salt stress . in addition, eight g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases were identified. among these kinases, three  were upregulated more than 32-fold under drought stress . we also found that  <dig> cysteine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase  genes showed differential expression .

transcription factors responding to drought and salt treatments in c. korshinskii
we performed global transcription-factor classification for differentially expressed transcripts and identified  <dig> transcripts belonging to  <dig> transcription-factor families . several transcription-factor family genes, e.g., zinc-finger protein and nac, were dramatically differentially expressed in both drought and salt treatments. in addition,  <dig> wrky members were strongly upregulated under drought treatment. among ring-finger proteins or myb-family members, more were downregulated under drought treatment. among dres, the up- and downregulated members were evenly balanced.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed transcription factors under drought or salt stress in c. korshinskii. d, transcription factors under drought stress; s, transcription factors under salt stress. blue bar represents upregulated degs; red bar indicates downregulated degs



genes of unknown function and genes unique to c. korshinskii
in this study, many contigs had no homologous matches among database sequences and thus have no known function. the vast set of un-annotated contigs  could be novel genes not present in the known genomes and specific to c. korshinskii . among those unknown contigs,  <dig>  of  <dig> degs and  <dig>  of  <dig> degs were drought- or salt-responsive, respectively, in c. korshinskii .

to identify genes that might be expressed uniquely in c. korshinskii under salt and/or drought stresses, we performed a new set of blast searches to compare these contigs to genes expressed in arabidopsis under salt and/or drought stresses  <cit> .

we found that  <dig> degs upregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii were also upregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis . these degs include some genes encoding cytochrome p <dig>  glucosyltransferase, etc.; however, some genes  that were strongly upregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii did not significantly change in expression in drought-treated arabidopsis , such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase and cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase. many genes  were significantly upregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii and slightly downregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis . some of these genes encode flavin-containing monooxygenase, src <dig> protein, and similar proteins.fig.  <dig> venn diagrams illustrating the degs under drought or salt treatment in c. korshinskii and arabidopsis. the blue color represents the upregulated or downregulated transcripts under drought or salt treatment in c. korshinskii, and the red color represent the upregulated or downregulated transcripts under drought or salt treatment in arabidopsis, respectively



a total of  <dig> degs that were downregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii were also determined to be downregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis . some of these genes encode nitrate reductase, glutathione s-transferase, etc.; however, some genes  that were strongly downregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii did not significantly change in expression in drought-treated arabidopsis , such as peroxidase and thiol protease. many genes  that were significantly downregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii were upregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis , including genes encoding subtilisin-like protease, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, etc.

a total of  <dig> degs were upregulated in salt-treated arabidopsis and c. korshinskii, such as spore-specific catalase and aldehyde dehydrogenase; however, many genes  were strongly upregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii but remained nearly constant in expression in salt-treated arabidopsis , such as plasma membrane h+-atpase and 60s ribosomal protein. some genes  that were significantly upregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii were slightly downregulated in salt-treated arabidopsis , including genes encoding adp, atp-carrier protein, and mannitol dehydrogenase.

a total of  <dig> degs were downregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii and arabidopsis , including genes encoding lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase and beta-glucosidase; however, some genes  were strongly downregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii but did not significantly change in expression in salt-treated arabidopsis , such as glutathione s-transferase and isoflavone conjugate-specific beta-glucosidase. many genes  that were significantly downregulated in salt-treated c. korshinskii were instead upregulated in salt-treated arabidopsis , including genes encoding peptide/nitrate transporter and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase.

of the  <dig> degs that were upregulated in both drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> degs were also upregulated in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis and  <dig> were downregulated in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis. of the  <dig> degs upregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> degs were upregulated and  <dig> degs were downregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis. in salt-treated arabidopsis,  <dig> of these degs were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated. six degs upregulated in drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii remained relatively constant in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis .

among  <dig> degs that were downregulated in both drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> were upregulated in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis and  <dig> were downregulated in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis. of the  <dig> degs downregulated in drought-treated c. korshinskii,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated in drought-treated arabidopsis, while,  <dig> of these degs were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated in salt-treated arabidopsis. twelve degs that were downregulated in both drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii remained relatively constant in both drought- and salt-treated arabidopsis, except that cko_contig_ <dig> remained relatively constant in drought-treated arabidopsis but not in salt-treated arabidopsis .

in drought-treated c. korshinskii, however,  <dig> degs  did not match any arabidopsis sequences in this study and thus were presumably unique to c. korshinskii. the expression levels of  <dig> genes changed significantly in drought-treated c. korshinskii; for example, cko_contig_ <dig> was predicted to encode e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase and was upregulated  <dig> -fold . in addition, genes for proteins such as phosphoinositide phospholipase c , trypsin-protein inhibitor , and bzip transcription factor  were expressed uniquely in drought-treated c. korshinskii.

in addition,  <dig> degs  in salt-treated c. korshinskii had no homologous sequence in the arabidopsis datasets and were considered unique to c. korshinskii. the expression levels of  <dig> genes changed dramatically in salt-treated c. korshinskii, such as cko_contig_ <dig>  predicted to encode polyphenol oxidase, which was upregulated  <dig> -fold, and cko_contig_ <dig>  predicted to encode serine/threonine kinase, which was upregulated  <dig> -fold . other genes, such as thiol protease , udp-glucosyltransferase , and polyphenol oxidase , were found to be uniquely expressed in salt-treated c. korshinskii . although we cannot yet be certain which genes are responsible for c. korshinskii’s stress resistance, we are convinced that the majority of predicted unigenes unique to c. korshinskii represent a valuable basis on which to explore gene diversity in c. korshinskii and support drought- or salt-stress resistance in c. korshinskii.

quantitative real-time-pcr validation of differentially expressed transcripts from rna-seq
to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of the illumina rna-seq results, a small number of contigs were chosen for quantitative real-time -pcr detection. the expression of those contigs in root, stem, leaf samples of drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii were analyzed . detailed information on the primers is provided in additional file  <dig>  the qpcr results for  <dig> selected contigs showed general agreement with their transcript-abundance changes as determined by rna-seq, suggesting the reliability of the transcriptomic profiling data. for example, under drought stress, cko_contig_ <dig>  which shows strong homology to cationic peroxidase  <dig>  was upregulated  <dig> -fold in c. korshinskii:  <dig> -fold in the stem and  <dig> -fold in the leaf . cko_contig_ <dig>  a homolog of l-type lectin-domain-containing receptor kinase, was upregulated  <dig> -fold in c. korshinskii under drought stress: upregulated  <dig> -fold in the root,  <dig> -fold in the stem and  <dig> -fold in the leaf .fig.  <dig> changes in transcript levels of  <dig> selected genes, as detected by real-time rt-pcr. the black bars represent the relative intensity of qrt-pcr from three independent biological replicates , and the red bars represent the expression level  of the transcript  . a includes  <dig> qrt-pcr results, and b includes another  <dig> qrt-pcr results. the qrt-pcr primers for each contig are listed in additional file  <dig>  pm, pd and ps represent that the tested materials were the whole seedlings including leaves, stems, and roots in normal growth condition, under drought treatment, and salt treatment, respectively. rm, rd and rs represents that the tested materials were the roots of the plant in normal growth condition, under drought treatment, and salt treatment, respectively. sm, sd and ss represent that the tested materials were the stems of the plant in normal growth condition, under drought treatment, and salt treatment, respectively. lm, ld and ls represent that the tested materials were the leaves of the plant in normal growth condition, under drought treatment, and salt treatment, respectively



cko_contig_ <dig>  a homolog of glutathione s-transferase, was upregulated  <dig> -fold under drought stress and  <dig> -fold under salt stress:  <dig> -fold in the drought-treated root,  <dig> -fold in the salt-treated root,  <dig> -fold in the drought-treated stem,  <dig> -fold in the salt-treated stem,  <dig> -fold in the drought-treated leaf and  <dig> -fold in the salt-treated leaf . nonetheless, moderate discrepancies between the expression levels and rpkm values were observed for three contigs: cko_contig_ <dig>  cko_contig_ <dig>  and cko_contig_ <dig> .

discussion
in this study, we generated de novo transcriptomes of c. korshinskii under drought and salt treatment and compared the expression profiles between control and drought and salt conditions, as well as between c. korshinskii and the model plant arabidopsis. from our analysis, we found that many genes/contigs related to protein kinases, certain transcription factors, the ros-scavenging system and ion transport proteins, gibberellin biosynthesis, carbon metabolism and osmotic regulation, and brassinosteroid-biosynthesis pathways are involved in drought- and salt-stress responses in c. korshinskii, with some of these genes being expressed significantly between c. korshinskii and arabidopsis, as discussed in detail below. these results provide a molecular basis for understanding the specific drought- and salt-tolerance mechanisms of c. korshinskii.

construction of an informative transcriptome dataset for c. korshinskii
transcriptome sequencing of c. korshinskii is fundamental to the identification of functional genes and the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in drought or salt adaptation and tolerance in c. korshinskii. in a recent study in c. korshinskii  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  million raw sequencing reads were generated,  <dig>  million clean reads were obtained, and  <dig>  contigs were assembled. the percentage of annotation was  <dig>  %. in our study, a total of  <dig>  million raw reads were generated from the samples, and  <dig>  million clean reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs . notably, the percentage of annotation was  <dig>  %. the numbers of total raw reads, clean reads, assembled contigs and the percentage of annotation were all higher than those obtained previously  <cit> , likely because we used several samples under different growth conditions for sequencing analysis, whereas only a sample under normal growth conditions was used by long et al.  <cit> . our de novo assembly of rna-seq improves the genome annotation of c. korshinskii.

based on comparisons with different plant species, the top four species with blast hits to annotated unigenes were glycine max, medicago truncatula, vitis vinifera, and lotus japonicus, species whose genome annotations are comprehensive and largely accepted. the low rate of annotation compared with other plants such as safflower flowers   <cit> , aegilops variabilis   <cit> , and ma bamboo   <cit>  might be due to technological limitations, such as sequencing depth, splice junctions and read length  <cit> , which are common in de novo assembly and rna-seq analysis. we can speculate that the unannotated contigs  represent a specific genetic resource for c. korshinskii, which is worthy of further investigation. unannotated sequences were on average much shorter than the annotated contigs ; however, a considerable percentage of contigs  that were longer than 500 bp and that had rpkm values  <cit>  over three had no known homologs in known plant species.

protein kinases are important for drought and salt tolerance in c. korshinskii
protein kinases phosphorylate and activate many target proteins in major signaling events in response to osmotic stress in higher plants  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed that glycine soja g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase gssrk significantly increased in expression under alkaline  treatment, identifying it as an alkaline-responsive gene  <cit> . in this work, cko_contig_ <dig>  associated with g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, was upregulated  <dig> -fold in drought-treated c. korshinskii whole plants and  <dig> -fold in drought-treated arabidopsis datasets. we also found that three other homologous genes  were upregulated more than 32-fold in drought-treated c. korshinskii but changed little in arabidopsis datasets . these results are also consistent with the results of studies on the expression pattern of gssrk in glycine soja under nacl  and peg treatments   <cit> .

arabidopsis thaliana l-type lectin-domain-containing receptor kinase atlpk <dig> is strongly induced by stress hormones and salt treatments, and overexpression of atlpk <dig> in arabidopsis enhances salt-stress tolerance  <cit> . in this study, cko_contig_ <dig> had a highly significant blast hit to the l-type lectin-domain-containing receptor kinase and showed increased transcript abundance in salt-treated arabidopsis datasets , but was downregulated 8-fold in salt-treated c. korshinskii. another homologous gene  was upregulated 7-fold in drought-treated c. korshinskii but upregulated slightly in arabidopsis . kempa et al.  <cit>  found that a plastid-localized glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> gsk- <dig> was induced at high concentrations of nacl, kcl and sorbitol and could modulate salt-stress tolerance and regulate carbohydrate metabolism in medicago sativa cv. europa. we identified  <dig> contigs related to glycogen synthase kinase and only one differentially expressed transcript , which was uniquely expressed and upregulated  <dig> -fold under drought stress in c. korshinskii, with no homologous gene detected in the examined arabidopsis datasets.

in c. korshinskii, a large number of protein kinases may play an essential role in sensing external drought and salt signals and regulating gene expression at the cellular level in response, as seen in arabidopsis ; however, the genes encoding protein kinases in response to stresses  may differ between c. korshinskii and other plants.

many wrky, myb, nam, ataf, and cuc  transcription factors were found to confer resistance to drought or salt stress in plants, and overexpression of these transcription factors enhanced the drought or salt tolerance of transgenic plants . previous research has found that the expression levels of wheat  tawrky <dig> were upregulated  <dig> -fold under peg treatment and  <dig> -fold under salt stress  <cit> . in the c. korshinskii and arabidopsis datasets, we detected eight wrky transcription factors that showed increased expression in both drought-treated c. korshinskii and arabidopsis , especially cko_contig_ <dig> . the characteristics of wrky expression in c. korshinskii and arabidopsis were consistent with findings from research on wheat under drought stress  <cit> . the expression of the arabidopsis zinc-finger proteins zat  <dig> and zat  <dig> is stimulated by drought  and salt stresses   <cit> . in this study, we found that a zinc finger protein, cko_contig_ <dig>  was upregulated  <dig> -fold in drought-treated c. korshinskii but downregulated slightly in drought-treated arabidopsis, and cko_contig_ <dig> showed increased transcript abundance  in salt-treated c. korshinskii but was only upregulated  <dig> -fold in salt-treated arabidopsis. interestingly, we found that eight zinc-finger protein contigs were downregulated in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii. these findings support the possibility that zinc-finger proteins could play key roles as both positive and negative regulators of plant defenses  <cit> .

we also identified differences in the expression profiles of some other transcription factors in c. korshinskii and arabidopsis under the same stresses ; for example, some nac, myb, and erfs were downregulated in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii. this result indicated that some myb and erf transcription factors might function as negative regulators of drought or salt tolerance in c. korshinskii.

functional genes related to the ros-scavenging system and ion transport in c. korshinskii
ros are produced in plant cells under normal and stressful conditions  <cit>  and can be removed by the antioxidant system  <cit> . in c. korshinskii, antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , catalase , and peroxidase  protect cells and subcellular systems from drought or salt damage caused by ros . for example, cko_contig_ <dig> showed strong homology to cat and was transcribed at high levels in salt-treated c. korshinskii  and upregulated  <dig> -fold in salt-treated arabidopsis . therefore, it is most likely associated with enhanced cat activity and responsible for converting the increased h2o <dig> into h2o and o <dig>  <cit> . ascorbate peroxidase  represents the ascorbate-dependent h2o2-scavenging mechanism in plants, which reduces h2o <dig> to h2o using ascorbic acid as an electron acceptor  <cit> . eleven apx proteins were uniquely expressed in treated c. korshinskii  but were not detected in arabidopsis datasets. two of these proteins  showed increased transcript abundance under drought stress. in the glutathione peroxidase  pathway, gpx can reduce h2o <dig> to the corresponding hydroxyl compounds  <cit> . interestingly, in our datasets,  <dig> gpx proteins were expressed uniquely in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii. in particular, cko_contig_ <dig> was upregulated  <dig> -fold in drought-treated c. korshinskii and upregulated  <dig>  % under salt stress, no homologous contigs were found in published arabidopsis datasets .

it is possible that the survival of plants under salt stress depends on the accumulation of high levels of ions in the tissue for the maintenance of osmotic balance  <cit> . cko_contig_ <dig>  associated with a k+-transporter, was uniquely upregulated  <dig> -fold under salt stress in c. korshinskii but was not found in the considered arabidopsis datasets.

the transcript profile was consistent with the profile of k+-transporters in r. trigyna, most of which were upregulated under salt stress  <cit> . this result suggests that k+-transporters were enhanced and na+/k+ homeostasis reestablished in salt-treated c. korshinskii, as seen in r. trigyna under salt stress  <cit> . it is possible that plasma-membrane h+-atpases  are involved in the mitigation of physiological disturbances imposed by salt stress  <cit> . interestingly, in this study, cko_contig_ <dig>  encoding plasma membrane h+-atpases , showed significant increases in expression  in salt-treated c. korshinskii but remained relatively constant in salt-treated arabidopsis. this finding echoes the results of other studies on salt-treated plants, such as oryza sativa indica cultivars  <cit> . transcripts encoding proteins associated with functions such as diterpenoid biosynthesis mechanosensitive ion channels  accumulated in both drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii but were not detected in arabidopsis datasets. these results indicate that c. korshinskii may have the specific ability to transduce these stress stimuli into electrical signals to enhance drought or salt tolerance. in summary, a small number of contigs uniquely found in c. korshinskii but not in arabidopsis suggest that c. korshinskii may have a stress-tolerance mechanism distinct from that of the model plant arabidopsis.

contigs in response to gibberellin biosynthesis in c. korshinskii
plant growth and development are regulated by gibberellins , which are regulated by numerous genes involved in ga biosynthesis and degradation. ga biosynthesis is tightly controlled by gibberellin 20-beta-dioxygenase  and gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase . gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase  catalyzes the deactivation of bioactive gas  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the cellular concentration of bioactive gas was reduced via an increase in expression of ga2ox <dig>  resulting in an accumulation of della, an inhibitor of plant growth  <cit> . based on transcriptome-sequence analysis of c. korshinskii and arabidopsis, we identified nine drought- or salt-responsive ga2ox proteins, but these contigs were not found in arabidopsis datasets . only five ga3ox proteins and cko_contig_ <dig> were overexpressed in both-drought treated c. korshinskii and in researched arabidopsis datasets . two ga20ox proteins were detected at higher levels in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii, but no homologous gene was found in the arabidopsis datasets . in addition, three contigs associated with della protein were downregulated in both treated c. korshinskii and arabidopsis . thus, we propose that gas are upregulated under salt stress for normal growth of halophytes such as c. korshinskii, with accompanying repression of the expression of della proteins. our prediction is supported to some degree by studies of a ga-deficient mutant of arabidopsis  <cit> .

contigs associated with carbon metabolism and osmotic regulation in c. korshinskii and arabidopsis
responses of carbon metabolism or starch metabolism to drought stress have been found in many plants, such as alfalfa   <cit>  and maize   <cit> . in c. korshinskii, seven sugar-transport proteins,  <dig> carbohydrate-transport proteins, one granule-bound glycogen  synthase protein and two sucrose-udp glucosyltransferase proteins were found to be differentially expressed under drought or salt stress . in particular, cko_contig_ <dig>  encoding a sugar-transport protein, was upregulated  <dig> -fold in salt-treated samples. the expression data suggest that sugar or carbon metabolism, as well as various sugar-related signaling pathways, are influenced by drought stress in c. korshinskii.

the synthesis and transport of substances involved in osmotic regulation  promote salt tolerance in most plants and crops  <cit> . previous studies have reported that prot accumulation is increased under salt stress in several plants, such as barley and mangrove  <cit> . our experimental results showed an increase in expression of the proline transporter gene , which was uniquely upregulated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in drought- and salt-treated c. korshinskii, respectively, but not in arabidopsis. this drought- or salt-treated expression pattern in c. korshinskii was similar to the findings in barley and mangrove  <cit> . in yeast, amino-acid permeases  complement proline-uptake deficiency and mediate the efficient transport of proline, alanine, and valine, but the expression of most members of the aap-gene family was repressed under high-salt conditions  <cit> . surprisingly, the transcription of aap  was uniquely induced  in drought-treated c. korshinskii, and no homologous gene was found in published arabidopsis datasets. this finding suggests that c. korshinskii had the distinct ability to synthesize and transport various osmoprotectants, such as proline, osmotin, and amino acids, to maintain cell turgor under osmotic stress, which is not seen in the model plant arabidopsis or in other eukaryotes.

contigs associated with brassinosteroid-biosynthesis pathways in c. korshinskii
brassinolides regulate plant growth and development and have been known to improve plant tolerance to abiotic stresses  <cit> . the results of the rna-seq expression analysis showed that  <dig> contigs involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway were regulated in treated c. korshinskii . cko_contig_ <dig> , a homolog of brassinosteroid-6-oxidase family protein, was differentially regulated in treated c. korshinskii and arabidopsis transcriptome datasets . we further found four contigs, cko_contig_ <dig> , cko_contig_ <dig> , cko_contig_ <dig> , and cko_contig_ <dig> , that are involved in starch and sucrose metabolism in drought- or salt-treated c. korshinskii, but no homologous genes were detected in arabidopsis datasets . these genes are necessary to enhance the biosynthesis of soluble sugars such as glucose, sucrose, and fructose and to maintain cell osmotic adjustment and balance .

CONCLUSIONS
this work presents an original transcriptome-sequencing analysis of mixed rna from c. korshinskii whole seedlings  under drought and salt stresses. a total of  <dig>  cdna contigs from whole c. korshinskii plants were obtained, of which  <dig>  % were annotated with gene descriptions, while the remaining  <dig>  % were unknown. a large number of candidate functional genes were identified as being potentially involved in multiple mechanisms that might contribute to drought or salt tolerance, meriting further investigation. several key pathways, such as metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ribosome, purine metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction, and go terms, such as metabolic process, cell or cell part, and catalytic activity, were identified as being involved in drought and salt tolerance in c. korshinskii. in addition, hundreds of degs appeared to be expressed uniquely in c. korshinskii under drought and salt stress, respectively, compared to the published arabidopsis database. these unknown genes and uniquely expressed degs were presumably genes unique to c. korshinskii that are involved in drought or salt tolerance. this information of c. korshinskii genes will be very useful in future studies on molecular adaptations to abiotic stress in leguminous plants and will facilitate the genetic manipulation of important plants.
