BACKGROUND
nanoparticles have recently received increased attention in the life sciences. because of their small size, their cellular uptake mechanisms such as endocytosis  <cit>  and the possibility to functionalize them with biofunctional active groups, nanoparticles offer a large range of applications  <cit> . they can be tagged with cell-specific target sites  <cit>  and if they are magnetic, they can be moved and influenced by an external magnetic field  <cit> . one example of these features is cellular hyperthermia of tumours, a novel clinical protocol in which the mnps are heated up by an alternating magnetic field and tumour cells are destroyed by thermal energy  <cit> .

another interesting application of magnetic nanoparticles is magnetofection™. this technique uses them as a carrier for nucleic acids and enhances cell transfection with an external magnetic field  <cit> . mnps are already routinely used for contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, magnetic cell separation, and tissue repair studies  <cit> .

one idea for an application in neuroscience is the use of mnps to promote regeneration within the peripheral  and central nervous system . the outcome after injury repair in the nervous system is often poor, even in the pns  <cit> . here, different cell types participate in the regeneration of the injured nerve. after a peripheral nerve lesion, the axon distal from the injury site degenerates and schwann cells and later macrophages clean the neural tubes of cell debris and myelin, the so-called wallerian degeneration. additionally, schwann cells produce growth factors and form bands of büngner as guiding paths for the regrowing axons, building a regeneration-promoting environment  <cit> .

in the cns, regeneration of injured axons is even more difficult. unlike schwann cells, oligodendroglia do not show phagocytic activity. therefore, an inhibitory environment for axonal regeneration is evident and the clearance of the injury site of cell and myelin debris is much slower than in the pns. additionally, the regeneration-promoting environment produced by the schwann cells in the pns is absent  <cit> .

nanoparticles now offer the possibility to influence such processes locally. mittnacht et al.  <cit>  for example delivered rhoa-specific sirna by nanoparticles into pc <dig> cells as a neuronal cell model. thereby, they suppressed the signal transduction pathway for inhibitory proteins, resulting in enhanced neurite outgrowth of the pc <dig> cells after stimulation with nerve growth factor . in contrast, hamasaki et al.  <cit>  used magnetically labelled neural progenitor cells, which were located by an external magnetic field, to promote axon growth in organotypic co-cultures of brain cortex and spinal cord.

although there is a trend to use self-produced nanoparticles, reproducibility among different studies would be higher if not every study was based on distinct particles. thus, we used commercially available mnps and analyzed their uptake in cells of the nervous system. unfortunately, there is little literature concerning primary cell cultures and nanoparticles, especially with a neuroscientific background. mostly, previous studies used different kinds of cell lines such as pc <dig> as a neuronal model  <cit> , human umbilical vein endothelial cells   <cit>  and infinity™ telomerase-immortalised primary human fibroblasts   <cit> . however, cell lines are often tumour cells or immortalised cells, behaving differently than primary cells  <cit> .

for this reason, we compared neuronal differentiated pc <dig> cells with primary neuronal cells according to their uptake of green fluorescent mnps. primary neuronal cells were used from rat mixed neuronal/glial cerebellar cell cultures. these neuronal cells are mainly granular neurons cultured in a more in vivo like environment having cell contacts with different kinds of glial cells occurring in the cerebellum. thus, we analyzed the uptake of mnps for the different kinds of glial cells, too. together with the analysis of rat primary cell cultures of the pns, mixed schwann cell/fibroblast cultures, both culture systems give a good idea which cells will take up nanoparticles in vivo for a future therapeutic approach.

to verify our results in the dispersed cell cultures, organotypic co-cultures of spinal cord slices and peripheral nerve grafts as a more complex model were additionally analyzed. the organotypic co-cultures mimic the tissue architecture of both parts of the nervous system and allow screening of the cellular uptake of mnps in a more tissue-like environment.

methods
magnetic nanoparticles
commercial green fluorescent mnps produced by chemicell  were used. these mnps have a magnetite core covered by a lipophilic green fluorescent dye and a polysaccharide matrix of glucuronic acid, a derivate of glucose, for additional functionalization. because of the carboxyl group of the coating polymer, the particles become anionic in solution. zeta potential measurements of these mnps suspended in cell culture media revealed a negative charge on the particles; this finding was also observed in the presence of serum supplement. mnps were diluted the day before use with three different serum-supplemented media: for primary cell cultures mnps were diluted in dulbecco's modified eagle medium  medium with 10% fetal calf serum ,  <dig> g/l d-glucose and 1% penicillin/streptomycin , resulting in a hydrodynamic mnp diameter of  <dig> nm  and a zeta potential of - <dig>  mv. pc <dig> cells were cultured with mnps diluted in roswell park memorial institute  medium with 10% fcs,  <dig> ng/ml ngf ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine and 1% pen/strep, yielding a hydrodynamic mnp diameter of  <dig> nm  and a zeta potential of - <dig>  mv. for the organotypic co-cultures, mnps were diluted in 50% eagle's minimal essential medium , 25% hank's balanced salt solution , 25% fcs,  <dig>  mm d-glucose, 1% pen/strep and  <dig> ng/ml recombinant rat glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  giving a hydrodynamic diameter of  <dig> nm  and a zeta potential of - <dig>  mv.

animal care
all animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the german animal welfare act. the study was approved by the animal care and use committees of saxony-anhalt. formal approval to conduct the experiments described was obtained from the animal subjects review board of our institution and can be provided upon request. all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.

cerebellar cultures
5- <dig> day neonatal rats were decapitated and the cerebellum was separated. meninges were removed in serum-free dmem containing  <dig> g/l d-glucose and 1% pen/strep. subsequently, the cerebelli were mechanically dissociated  in serum-free dmem and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. cells were resuspended in serum-supplemented dmem with 10% fcs,  <dig> g/l d-glucose, 1% pen/strep, counted and seeded for immunocytochemistry in 12-well plates with 1* <dig> cells per well on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips . for viability assay, cerebellar cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated petri dishes  with a cell density of  <dig> * <dig> cells per dish.

cells were incubated at 37°c in a humidified 6% co <dig> atmosphere and medium was changed  <dig> h after preparation to remove cell debris.

for the uptake quantification based on immunocytochemistry, the medium was replaced with mnp medium  at different time points depending on cell type and different proliferation patterns of the various cell types. for example, the number of neurons decreases over the first week in cerebellar cultures  <cit>  and oligodendroglia differentiate from precursor cells after more than one week  <cit> . quantification of our mixed cerebellar cultures respective the culture composition revealed that they are composed of  <dig> %  astroglia,  <dig> %  microglia,  <dig> %  neurons and no oligodendroglia on day in vitro   <dig>  on div  <dig>  they contain  <dig> %  microglia,  <dig> %  astroglia,  <dig> %  neurons and  <dig> %  oligodendroglia. on div  <dig>  they are composed of  <dig> %  microglia,  <dig> %  astroglia,  <dig> %  neurons and  <dig> %  oligodendroglia.

to quantify the uptake of neurons, mnp medium was added on div  <dig>  mnp uptake in astroglia and microglia was analyzed on div  <dig> and in oligodendroglia on div  <dig>  simultaneously, mnp-free medium was added to control cells.

for viability assay  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml mnp-containing medium was added to the cultures on div  <dig>  at the same time, mnp-free medium was added to control cells. cells were incubated for  <dig> h, washed with phosphate buffered saline  and used further for immunocytochemistry or for viability assay.

schwann cell/fibroblast cultures
5- <dig> day old rats were decapitated, the spinal ganglia were taken out and collected in a solution of  <dig> ml serum-free dmem ,  <dig> μl collagenase ,  <dig> μl hyaluronidase  and  <dig> ml dispase ii . in this enzyme-supplemented medium the isolated spinal ganglia were incubated at 37°c in a 6% co <dig> humidified atmosphere for ca.  <dig>  h to dissociate the cells enzymatically. the cells were additionally dissociated mechanically using injection needles  and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. afterwards the cells were resuspended in serum-supplemented medium .

for immunocytochemistry,  <dig> or  <dig> mm coverslips in 12-well plates were coated with laminin  before seeding 5* <dig> cells per well.

for viability assay cells were seeded on laminin-coated petri dishes  with a cell density of  <dig> * <dig> cells per dish.

cells were incubated at 37°c in a humidified 6% co <dig> atmosphere and the medium was changed  <dig> h after preparation to remove cell debris. culture composition was quantified and revealed  <dig> %  schwann cells and  <dig> %  fibroblasts on div  <dig>  for immunocytochemistry and viability assay, the medium was replaced with mnp medium on div  <dig>  mnp medium contained  <dig> μg/ml mnps for immunocytochemistry and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml mnps for the viability assay. mnp-free medium was added to control cells. after  <dig> h, cells were washed with pbs and used further.

cell line
pc <dig> cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine coated culture flasks and cultured with rpmi medium supplemented with 10% fcs,  <dig> mm l-glutamine and pen/strep. after  <dig> h, cells were differentiated with  <dig> ng/ml ngf for  <dig> days. differentiated cells were seeded afterwards in 12-well plates with  <dig> * <dig> cells per well on poly-d-lysine coated coverslips and kept in differentiation medium for  <dig> days before the medium was replaced with differentiation medium supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml mnps. after  <dig> h, cells were washed with pbs and fixed for immunocytochemistry.

organotypic spinal cord co-cultures
organotypic spinal cords co-cultured with peripheral nerve grafts were prepared according to vyas et al.  <cit>  with slight modifications. for the cultures, neonatal rats of postnatal day 3- <dig> were used. rats were decapitated, the spinal cords excised and roots and meninges removed in dissection buffer , 1% pen/strep).

the lumbar part of the spinal cord was cut into  <dig> μm transverse sections with a mcilwain tissue chopper . about  <dig> usable sections could be obtained from one lumbar spinal cord part. three slices were cultured on one millicell membrane insert  placed in 6-well plates. each well contained  <dig> ml of medium composed of 50% mem, 25% hbss, 25% fcs,  <dig>  mm d-glucose, 1% pen/strep and  <dig> ng/ml gdnf to keep the motor neurons in the culture alive.

to enhance the motor neuronal survival and to guide sprouting neurites, a co-culture of the spinal cord slice with a peripheral nerve graft as a reconstructed ventral root was chosen.

as peripheral nerve graft, pieces of ulnar and median nerves were harvested from the same animals and one graft was opposed to the ventral surface of each spinal cord slice.

to check the contribution of mnps in the tissue slices,  <dig> μg/ml mnps were added to the medium for the whole culture time. co-cultures were incubated at 37°c in humidified 6% co <dig> atmosphere. the medium was changed  <dig> h after preparation and afterwards every second day.

immunocytochemistry of cell cultures
staining procedure
after  <dig> h mnp incubation, cells were washed once with pbs to remove free-floating mnps and fixed for  <dig> min with 4% paraformaldehyde . fixing was followed by three times washing with pbs. unspecific binding sides were blocked for  <dig> h with 10% fcs,  <dig> % triton-x in pbs. subsequently, cells were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°c. cell type specific primary antibodies were chosen: primary neurons were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule associated protein- <dig> , pc <dig> cells with rabbit polyclonal anti-ß-iii-tubulin , microglial cells with mouse monoclonal anti-cd11b/c  or with rabbit polyclonal anti- ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule  <dig> , astroglia with rabbit polyclonal anti- glial fibrillary acidic protein  and oligodendroglia with mouse monoclonal anti-galactocerebroside . schwann cells were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-s <dig>  and fibroblasts with mouse monoclonal anti-fibronectin  antibody. primary antibodies were diluted in pbs containing  <dig> % triton-x and 1% fcs.

after incubation overnight, cells were washed three times with pbs and incubated for  <dig> h with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse alexa fluor  <dig> dye secondary antibody  diluted 1: <dig> in pbs. cells were washed again three times with pbs and cell nuclei were counterstained with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . after washing again with pbs, coverslips were embedded with immu-mount .

quantification
to quantify the cellular uptake cell type specific antibodies were used to stain cell lines followed by counterstaining all nuclei with dapi. control coverslips  and  <dig> coverslips of the mnp-incubated cells were used and 4- <dig> random images per coverslip  were taken. images were acquired with an axioimager microscope . total cell number , the number of cell type specific stained cells  and the number of cells which were co-localized with the green fluorescent mnps were counted with the axiovision rel.  <dig>  imaging software by zeiss. values were calculated as a percentage to the total cell number providing the percentage specific cell types in the cultures. total uptake was calculated as percentage of specific cell type with mnp co-localization to the total number of this specific cell type.

in pc <dig> cells, the total cell number, the number of clearly differentiated cells  and the number of differentiated cells co-localized with mnps was quantified and calculated in a similar manner.

statistical analysis was performed with graph pad prism  <dig>  using an unpaired t-test for the comparison of control and mnp group. for each cell type n =  <dig> images from 4- <dig> coverslips were chosen. for the comparison of the mnp uptake between the different cell types in the cerebellar cultures a one-way anova followed by a bonferroni post-hoc test was performed . the comparison of the mnp uptake between primary neurons/pc <dig> cells and between schwann cells/fibroblasts was done with an unpaired t-test . in all statistical tests a p-value ≤  <dig>  was considered to be statistically significant.

immunohistochemistry of organotypic co-culture
staining procedure
cultures were fixed after one week by replacing the medium with 4% pfa overnight. for immunohistochemistry, the membranes of inserts were separated from the carrier and cultures attached on membranes were stained free-floating according to the protocol described above. as primary antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-pan-neuronal neurofilament marker , rabbit polyclonal anti-ß-iii-tubulin , mouse monoclonal anti-cd11b/c , rabbit polyclonal anti-gfap , rabbit polyclonal anti-s <dig>  and rabbit polyclonal anti-myelin basic protein  were used to visualize the main cell types.

imaging
organotypic co-cultures were imaged with a tcs spe dmi <dig> confocal microscope by leica  and edited in the leica application suite  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows a phase contrast image of a spinal cord co-culture. this picture was taken with a cell culture microscope dmi <dig> by leica and was edited with photoshop cs <dig>  to create a collage of the whole co-culture. images of motor neurons were taken at the ventral part of the spinal cord as marked in figure  <dig> by the upper white box. images of other cell types were taken in the vicinity of the intersection of the spinal cord slice and the peripheral nerve graft, marked by the other boxes in figure  <dig> 

electron microscopy
cultures were fixed for  <dig> h with 4% pfa. they were washed with  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer and incubated for  <dig> h with 1% osmium tetroxide, washed again with  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer and 50% ethanol and incubated with 2% uranyl acetate for  <dig> h. subsequently, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and embedded in durcupan™ acm fluka . after hardening at 68°c, cell culture plastic was removed and cells were cut in ultra-thin slices of  <dig> nm. images were taken with an em  <dig> transmission electronic microscope by zeiss and edited with adobe photoshop cs <dig> 

viability assay of cell cultures
to reveal changes in cell viability of primary cell cultures incubated with mnps, an mts -5--2--2h-tetrazolium) proliferation assay  was used. to avoid previously reported and discussed interferences of nanoparticles with colorimetric assays and absorbance measurement  <cit> , the experimental protocol of the mts assay was slightly changed. cells of both primary cell cultures were incubated on div  <dig> for  <dig> h with mnp medium containing different concentrations of mnps . control cells received mnp-free medium. after  <dig> h of incubation, the medium was removed and cells were washed once with sterile pbs. new mnp-free medium and mts reagent were added. cells were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c in humidified 6% co <dig> atmosphere. all values were normalized by the mean of the blank.

after incubation the absorbance was measured with a tecan m <dig> microplate reader  at  <dig> nm. two values per petri dish were determined and the mean used for statistical analysis. statistical analysis was performed with graphpad prism  <dig> using a one-way anova followed by dunnett's post-hoc test. a p-value ≤  <dig>  was considered to be statistically significant.

to check for integrity of the cell cultures, staining of cells with nuclear fast red-aluminium sulphate and prussian blue was performed. prussian blue stained iron- oxide and visualized remaining mnps . images for each group were acquired with an axioimager microscope .

RESULTS
cellular uptake
in this study we used anionic mnps for uptake analysis in cells of the nervous system. previous studies reported that the uptake of anionic nanoparticles in cells is mainly mediated by endocytosis  <cit> . because of this, we initially looked at the localization of mnps using nuclear fast red-aluminium sulphate and prussian blue staining in mixed cerebellar and schwann cell/fibroblast cultures . cultures of the control  and the mnp group  revealed no visual differences in culture integrity and composition. mnps showed mainly cellular localization in the cerebellar cultures  and in schwann cell/fibroblast cultures . to look in more detail, we used confocal and electron microscopy. confocal microscopy demonstrated green fluorescent mnps inside the cells and 3-d projections illustrated that mnps were coplanar with the cell bodies and nucleus . the amount of mnps inside cells fluctuated between the cell types; e.g. microglia  displayed a high amount of mnps whereas pc <dig> cells  and schwann cells  took them up to a lesser extent. electron microscopy revealed an accumulation of mnps in intracellular vesicular compartments in microglial cells  and schwann cells , confirming an endocytotic uptake mechanism.

cell cultures
mixed cerebellar cultures were incubated for  <dig> h with mnps on div  <dig>  at this time point, mixed cerebellar cultures contained  <dig> %  detected neurons in the control cultures and  <dig> %  detected neurons in the cultures incubated with mnps.

cultures of pc <dig> cells revealed  <dig> %  clearly differentiated cells in the control and  <dig> %  differentiated cells in the cultures incubated with the mnps. overall, incubation of primary neurons and pc <dig> cells with mnps for  <dig> h did not effect the cell number of both cell types .

the comparison of the uptake potential of neuronal differentiated pc <dig> cells with primary neuronal cells demonstrated that  <dig> %  of mnps had been uptaken in pc <dig> cells compared with only  <dig> %  in the primary neurons . representative fluorescent images of pc <dig> cells and neurons with mnp uptake are shown in figure  <dig>  control cells  illustrated no green fluorescence whereas cells incubated with mnps showed green fluorescent mnps co-localized with pc <dig> cells  and primary neurons .

besides neurons, cerebellar cultures contain different types of glial cells. for analysis of glia cells, we stained the cultures for glia cell type specific antibodies on div  <dig>  at this time, cultures contained  <dig> %  microglia in control cultures and  <dig> %  microglia in cultures incubated with mnps. mnp incubation for  <dig> h increased the number of microglia by  <dig> %  . astroglia in control cultures represented  <dig> %  and in cultures incubated with mnps  <dig> % . no changes in the amount of astroglia were induced by mnp incubation . for analysis of oligodendroglia, the cultures were stained on div  <dig> with an oligodendroglial marker.  <dig> %  oligodendroglia were found in control cultures and  <dig> %  in cultures incubated with mnps. the percentage of oligodendroglia did not change by mnp incubation . the comparison between the different cerebellar cell types revealed significant differences in the number of cells which took up mnps :  <dig> %  of microglia,  <dig> %  of astroglia,  <dig> %  of oligodendroglia and  <dig> %  of neurons showed uptake of mnps . representative images of glial cell types with mnp uptake are shown in figure  <dig>  microglia of control cultures are illustrated in figure 8a, astroglia in figure 8c and oligodendroglia in figure 8e. all lacked green fluorescent signals. the green fluorescent mnps are clearly seen in cultures incubated with mnps for  <dig> h . the images also show differences in the cellular uptake of mnps. stained microglia clearly demonstrated a higher content of mnps per cell than the other cell types .

although there is an increase in cell number of microglia in cultures incubated with mnps, the viability assay revealed no significant differences between control cells and cells incubated with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml mnps  .

mixed schwann cell/fibroblast cultures were used on div  <dig> and contained  <dig> %  schwann cells in control cultures. the incubation with mnps induced a decrease of  <dig> %  in the number of schwann cells to  <dig> %  schwann cells .  <dig> %  of fibroblast were found in the control cultures and  <dig> %  in cultures incubated with mnps indicating a trend of an increased number of fibroblasts  compared to controls . nevertheless, schwann cells seem to be more sensitive to the mnps then fibroblasts, but their uptake capacity is similar:  <dig> %  of schwann cells and  <dig> %  of fibroblasts showed uptake of mnps after  <dig> h incubation time . representative images of schwann cells and fibroblasts with mnp uptake are illustrated in figure  <dig>  schwann cells and fibroblasts of the control cultures lacked green fluorescent signals , but cells incubated with mnps showed green fluorescent mnps co-localized with the cells .

the viability assay revealed no significant differences in viability between control cells and cells incubated with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml mnps for  <dig> h  .

organotypic co-cultures
organotypic co-cultures of spinal cord and peripheral nerves were used to verify the results of the dispersed cultures of the cns and pns in a more complex model. mnps were not found inside of motor neurons and their neurites  or in schwann cells guiding sprouting neurites. microglia revealed vesicular accumulation of huge amounts of mnps inside the cells . astroglia  and oligodendroglia took up mnps and showed single accumulation. thus, uptake in organotypic culture resembles the uptake observed in dispersed cultures.

discussion
literature regarding primary cell cultures, especially of the nervous system and nanoparticles, is limited. most previous studies in nanosciences use cell lines such as pc <dig> as a neuronal model  <cit> . however, cell lines are often tumour cells or immortalised cells behaving differently than primary cells  <cit> . pc <dig> cells show a reliable uptake of nanoparticles: non-functionalized polymer-coated nanoparticles were found to be internalized in the cytoplasm in a highly non-specific manner  <cit> , without toxic effects. pisanic ii et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a qualitative proportional uptake of anionic nanoparticles, indicating non-limited uptake for the used concentrations. even biological functions of pc <dig> cells could be influenced by nanoparticles. hussain et al.  <cit>  for example, depleted dopamine and dopamine metabolites with manganese oxide particles in a dose-dependent manner. comparing differentiated pc <dig> cells and primary cerebellar neurons in our study, we found significant differences in the uptake of mnps. a high cellular uptake was observed in the pc <dig> cells compared with only about 13% in primary neurons. obviously, pc <dig> cells are a questionable choice for exploring the response of neurons to nanoparticles and do not predict neuronal uptake of primary neurons.

we used mixed cerebellar cultures to model interactions of the major cell types of the cns. they contain, apart from neurons, microglia, astroglia and oligodendroglia, which all have the potential to internalize mnps  <cit> . however, the uptake of mnps was distinct between the different cell types of these primary cultures. mnps were found to be predominantly taken up by microglia.

microglial cells are resident macrophages of the cns, sensing cell damage and pathogens  <cit> . if microglia are activated by a stimulus, they change their morphology, up-regulate immunologically relevant molecules such as chemokine receptors, major histocompatibility complex molecules and phagocytic receptors  <cit> , and phagocytose possible pathogens. lundqvist et al.  <cit>  showed that nanoparticles become surrounded by a protein corona if they are suspended in blood plasma. different particle sizes and charges resulted in different coronas which were composed for example of immunglobulins, lipoproteins and complement factors. this protein corona results in an opsonization of nanoparticles and phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia  <cit> . given that the mnps used in this study were suspended in serum containing medium, it is possible to assume an opsonization of the mnps by serum proteins which stimulate the microglia to phagocytose. we found that nearly 80% of the microglia in these cultures took up mnps. additionally, microglia proliferate in response to pathogens  <cit> . this was demonstrated in our study, too. the number of microglia increased after incubation with mnps. this indicates activation of the microglia through the mnps and suggests a problem for in vivo application. microglia would phagocytose the administered mnps before they could target other cells such as neurons. additionally, they would trigger immune responses and influence other cell types. this could counteract with the goal to use the mnps for the promotion of nerve regeneration in pathological conditions.

mnps were also internalized by astroglia and oligodendroglia, but to a lesser extent. phagocytosis is described in the literature for both glia types, too. however, the potential seems to be lower than for microglia and differs in velocity between the cell types  <cit> , which could explain the different uptake of the glial cell types found in our study. in purified cultures, astroglia as well as oligodendroglial precursor cells revealed a satisfying uptake of different kinds of nanoparticles  <cit> . purified cultures just give information about single cell types and lack the interactions between the various cell populations that can be found in tissues. also pickard and chari  <cit> , who showed robust nanoparticle uptake in purified primary microglia, pointed out the importance of studies comparing and analyzing nanoparticle uptake in the major cell populations of the cns. our study, using mixed cultures of the cns and pns, bridges this gap and take the interactions of the cell types into account. additionally, pickard and chari  <cit>  predicted in their study "... that the rapid and extensive mnp uptake by endogenous microglia could represent a significant 'extracellular' barrier to particle uptake by other neural cell subpopulations." the results of our study confirm their prediction. as mentioned above, most mnps were phagocytosed by the microglial cells in the mixed cultures which presumably reduce the amount of mnps for uptake by other cells.

the mixed schwann cell/fibroblast cultures model the pns environment. the pns environment and especially the schwann cells influence nerve regeneration in the nervous system, too. both cell types took up mnps and do not show phagocytosis under normal conditions. but both cell types are able to activate phagocytic potential with appropriate stimulation. schwann cells are able to activate phagocytic functions during injury of the nerve and clear the injury site of cell and myelin debris  <cit> . also, in vitro, schwann cells retain this function and can be stimulated to phagocytose applied myelin membranes within  <dig> h  <cit> . fibroblasts, on the other hand, reveal substantial phagocytosis in wounds as well as under in vitro conditions  <cit> . in purified cultures, both cell types revealed reliable uptake of different kinds of nanoparticles  <cit> .

besides phagocytosis, different types of endocytotic pathways or diffusion  <cit>  of the negatively charged mnps, facilitated by positively charged membrane domains  <cit> , could also be possible mechanisms for the cellular uptake of mnps in astroglia, oligodendroglia, schwann cells and fibroblasts and might explain the particular mnp uptake of the different cell types in our experiments.

dispersed cultures do not model the in vivo situation and environment in total. cells grow in a monolayer and lack certain cell-cell connections. organotypic cultures offer a more complex and tissue-like environment for the cells. due of this factor, they model the in vivo environment more adequately than dispersed cultures do. we compared our results of the dispersed primary cell cultures of the cns and pns to the organotypic co-culture of spinal cord slices  and peripheral nerve graft . the uptake of mnps was similar between both systems. mnps were internalized predominately in microglia of the spinal cord slice, but not in neurons. astroglia, oligodendroglia and schwann cells revealed uptake too, but again to a lesser extent.

cellular uptake of exogenous particles might induce toxic effects. toxicity of nanoparticles is a serious problem for biological and medical purposes. however, nanoparticles are not basically toxic. in human dermal fibroblasts, gupta and gupta  <cit>  compared non-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with polymer-coated particles and revealed a toxic effect of the non-coated particles and no toxic effect of the coated ones. on the other hand, karlsson et al.  <cit>  compared different metal oxide nanoparticles of different sizes concerning their influences on viability and mitochondrial and dna damage. they found size- and metal oxide-dependent toxic effects and reported low toxicity of iron oxide particles. the mnps used in this study showed only low toxicity towards schwann cells. this would make them useful candidates for in vivo applications in the nervous system concerning toxicity at first view.

given that dissociated and organotypic cultures show similar uptake results, it is likely that these commercial mnps, although they show low toxicity, will not be easy to use in vivo in the nervous system. they activate the immune cells of the cns and are phagocytosed by microglia in high numbers. thus, for targeting cells other than microglia, the mnps have to be tagged with a cell-type specific marker. additional functionalizing of mnps with receptor agonists for a receptor-mediated uptake mechanism  <cit>  or a more lipophilic coating to increase membrane permeability can improve cell-specific uptake  <cit> . once the mnps are taken up in a sufficient amount and frequency by specific cells of the nervous system, they can be used for locally influencing cell responses to axonal injury, for example with the delivery of sirna or transplantation of supporting cells. also, delivery of local drugs, growth factors, hormones and extracellular matrix molecules in and on the cell surface to influence cell responses  <cit>  is possible through manipulation of mnp localization with an external magnetic field.

CONCLUSIONS
nanoparticles offer a large range of applications in life and neurosciences. their functionality often depends on the fact that they are internalized by cells. thus, we analyzed the uptake of commercially available mnps in cells of the nervous system and were able to show that pc <dig> cells differ in their uptake to primary neuronal cells, and thus are not an appropriate choice for answering questions concerning the response of neurons to nanoparticles. mnps in primary cerebellar and in organotypic co-cultures were found to be predominantly taken up by microglia, suggesting a problem for in vivo application of these commercial mnps because of the immune response. future research needs to overcome this immune system activation with cell-specific targeting and additional functionalization.
