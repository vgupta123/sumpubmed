BACKGROUND
mycoplasmas are the smallest living prokaryotes known, capable of self-replication. they belong to the class mollicutes and are distinguished phenotypically from other bacteria by their minute size and lack of a cell wall. genetically they differ by having a small genome size and low g+c content {1}  <cit> . mycoplasmas have adapted to a wide variety of hosts and can colonize man, other animals and plants. the colonising organisms are host specific. in humans, mycoplasmas colonize mainly the upper respiratory tract and the genitourinary tract.

the first human mycoplasma isolated was mycoplasma hominis  <cit> . it is a heterogeneous genital mycoplasma  <cit>  found in at least two-thirds of women with bacterial vaginosis , compared to 10% of healthy women  <cit> . m. hominis has also been isolated from the endometrium and fallopian tubes of 10% women with salpingitis. however, its role as a primary pathogen is doubtful since it co-exists with many other bacteria in bv  <cit> . studies made on women undergoing in vitro fertilization showed the presence of m. hominis only in  <dig> % of the women  <cit> .

isolation from other sites than the genitourinary tract has been reported. m. hominis has been found to cause wound, joint and central nervous system infections  <cit> , it has been isolated from cavernous angioma, but was not the cause of the disease  <cit>  and cases of brain and scalp abscesses and meningoencephalitis were also reported  <cit> . those cases demonstrated the pathogenic potentials of m. hominis and indicated a need for rapid recognition. so far culture is most commonly used for detection of genital mycoplasma, but it requires special handling, complex media, and cultivation positive samples need further testing to determinate the species cultivated  <cit> . a case report of brain abscess in a  <dig> year-old female patient with postpartum infection  <cit>  showed that culture took  <dig> –  <dig> days during which the patient's symptoms continued to worsen before the antibiotic treatment was changed.

comparison between culture method and pcr has been performed and showed that a pcr assay was as sensitive as culture for detection of m. hominis from clinical samples. in addition it was very specific  <cit> . an advantage of using pcr is that the system can detect the presence of both live and dead microorganisms in the sample. when comparing the original pcr protocols with the newly developed real-time protocol, it offers interesting advantages such as rapidity, closed system, which eliminates the risk of carry-overs, real-time monitoring of pcr activity, quantification of amplification product and, if required, mutation analysis.

a recent study designed for the detection of m. hominis by real-time pcr in hiv-positive patient swab samples, suggested the use of sybr green with primers targeting another housekeeping gene, the 16s rrna gene  <cit> . the 16s rrna gene is the most conserved microbial gene, though, in m. hominis minor sequence variation was observed  <cit> . because sequences from m. hominis isolates were available  and possible to compare with other mycoplasmas sequence  <cit> , we selected the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  as target for development of a quantitative real-time pcr. comparison of the dna sequences from different m. hominis isolates showed, however, some small variations in the amplified dna sequence  <cit> . we determined sensitivity and specificity of the m. hominis lightcycler real-time pcr and tested it on clinical swab samples using specific hybridization probes for detection.

RESULTS
design of primers and probes
the principles of the system we used are based on two specific hybridization probes located internally to the amplification primers, each of them labelled with a different fluorescent dye  <cit> . the dna sequence of primers and probes is shown .

we selected m. hominis pg <dig> type strain as a template for primers and probes. the primers and probes were designed with respect to conservation of the dna sequence within the m. hominis gap gene  <cit>  and difference from the related genital mycoplasma genitalium gap gene  . the amplified dna fragment was of  <dig> bp in size.

swissprot protein database was used to determine the amino acids sequence of gapdh enzyme . by use of the motifs program the active site was predicted to consist of the amino acids: ascttncl, located at nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit> . when comparing dna sequences of the active site between m. hominis and m. genitalium, only  <dig> out of  <dig> nucleotides are mismatching , and therefore the probes and primers were placed before this region.

as seen from fig.  <dig>  the g + c content of the m. hominis gap gene is very low. it was difficult to find a suitable location for the reverse primer, and therefore two reverse primers were designed . the sequence of the reverse primer ii was partly overlapping the encoding region of the active site of gapdh enzyme. when compared it was found that use of reverse primer i gave the highest sensitivity of the lightcycler pcr assay. concentration of  <dig> copies/μl of pg <dig> dna was not always detected in pcr runs when reverse primer ii was used, whereas with use of reverse primer i,  <dig> copies/μl of pg <dig> were present in every run, and therefore this primer was chosen for the following experiments.

in order to obtain optimal detection in the annealing phase of the pcr we designed the probes to anneal to the same strand as the forward primer and placed them as far as possible from that primer . one hybridization probe was labelled with fluorescein  in the 3' end, the other with lightcycler red <dig>  in the 5' end. when the probes are hybridized less than  <dig> nucleotides apart, fluorescence resonance energy transfer  will be induced. the distance between the two probes was one nucleotide after annealing to template dna allowing fret light to be measured.

sensitivity and specificity
dilution series of the standard dna from m. hominis pg <dig> were used to examine the sensitivity of the lightcycler pcr assay. the fluorescence curves are shown . detection of pcr product was possible for the lowest dna concentration:  <dig> copy/μl, equal to  <dig> copies in the reaction mixture . to reduce the noise, the cut-off value was set to  <dig> . the standard curve had an average slope equal to - <dig> , which means that the efficiency of the pcr reaction was  <dig>   . calculations of the efficiency derived from the function for the amount of pcr product that was formed, represented by equation: n = n <dig> × 2n, where n is the number of amplified product, n <dig> is the initial number of molecules and n is the number of the pcr cycles. ideally the efficiency equals  <dig>  additionally, the sensitivity of the assay was determined for two other m. hominis isolates by making dilution series of dna from m. hominis  <dig> and  <dig>  as for pg <dig>  detection of a pcr product was possible for the lowest dna concentration of  <dig> copy/μl indicating similar sensitivity of the two other isolates. the standard curves had slopes equal to - <dig>  for isolate  <dig> and - <dig>  for isolate  <dig>  the efficiency of the pcr reaction was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

to determine the reproducibility of the assay, ten dilution series of pg <dig> dna were analyzed in different pcr runs, and the values of crossing-points  were compared by calculation of the coefficients of variation . the values of cv were between  <dig> % and  <dig> % . in all runs  <dig> out of  <dig> samples were positive except for  <dig> copy/μl where a pcr product was seen in  <dig> out of  <dig> pcr runs. the reproducibility of the assay for the two other m. hominis isolates  <dig> and  <dig> was analyzed in three different pcr runs. in both isolates dilution of  <dig> copy/μl was present in three out of three runs, similarly to pg <dig> the dilution of  <dig> copy/μl was present in two out of three lightcycler runs. our detection limit was therefore  <dig> copy/μl, equals to  <dig> copies in the reaction mixture. the reproducibility of the assay was acceptable.

as a next step twenty m. hominis isolates  were tested with the designed primers and probes in the lightcycler real-time pcr. all isolates gave a positive fluorescence signal and the concentration of dna was similar to  <dig> copies/μl of pg <dig>  measured by the lightcycler instrument .

the specificity of the lightcycler assay targeting the gap gene was evaluated by testing human dna and dna from different mycoplasma species. with the specific probes there was no cross-reactivity to other mycoplasma species or human dna . for human dna we used a concentration of  <dig> copies/μl calculated by od measurements of the purified dna and the genome size.

since dna from different mycoplasmas was extracted by proteinase k treatment of pbs washed pellets, we tested such extracted dna for presence of inhibitors. two μl of dna from five different mycoplasmas  were spiked with  <dig> μl of pg <dig> dna of  <dig> copies/μl and added to the reaction mix. as illustrated  there was no inhibition in the proteinase k treated samples.

melting curve analysis
melting curve analysis can be used to determine the presence of non-specific amplification products. the melting temperature  is defined as the temperature at which half of a duplex-dna becomes single-stranded  <cit> . as it was impossible to place probes in completely conserved regions , we analyzed the melting curves of the real-time pcr products of the different m. hominis isolates. tm of pg <dig> dna was 66°c and equal for high and low concentrations of dna.

it was shown that the melting temperature of the pcr products of m. hominis dna clustered in  <dig> major groups . the isolates v <dig> and p <dig> had the same temperature of 66°c as pg <dig>  the second group  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  sc <dig>  dc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  w <dig> had a melting temperature of 64°c, while the last group  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  m <dig>   <dig>  had the melting temperature of 62°c. these different melting points were in agreement with variation in the dna sequence of the probe regions .

coloured media and possible pcr inhibition
many mycoplasma species were cultured in sp- <dig> or bea media for specificity of lightcycler analysis. additionally, the clinical samples were transported in sp- <dig> medium, which can be used for the recovery of m. hominis  <cit> , and bea medium was used for cultivation of m. hominis. therefore, to see the effect of the coloured media on the lightcycler assay, we constructed artificial samples consisting of sp- <dig> or bea medium spiked with dna of known concentration . two μl of the samples were analyzed by the lightcycler pcr. as shown , bea medium completely inhibited the reaction, whereas sp- <dig> inhibited only partially, but markedly reduced the pcr efficiency.

analysis of clinical samples
culture
eighty-three endocervical samples from women attending fertility clinics in denmark were cultured for the presence of m. hominis. two samples were found positive. three passages were examined for colour change, at each passage the colour of the medium turned pink, and samples were thus considered as positive cultures. proteinase k treated culture materials were analyzed by mycoplasma-genus-specific pcr  <cit> , which gives pcr products from 16s rrna gene of  <dig> bp in size. the pcr products from the two positive clinical samples were sequenced and the resulting dna sequence confirmed them to be m. hominis.

quantification by culture of these two positive samples was performed by limited dilution in growth medium. there was a colour change in  <dig> wells in both samples, which corresponds to  <dig>  ccu/ml in the swab sample, calculated from titration.

lightcycler pcr on dneasy treated samples
the cervical swab samples were dneasy treated and tested in duplicates by lightcycler pcr using the m. hominis gap-assay. two samples  were positive when examined by lightcycler pcr . the copy numbers were measured to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies/μl respectively. the amount of dna copies per ml in the original sample was calculated to be  <dig>  for sample  <dig> and  <dig>  for sample  <dig>  the two quantification methods for estimating bacterial load in positive samples thus showed that the number of live mycoplasma cells was 69%  and 29%  of what was found by pcr. the positive clinical samples showed melting temperature of 64°c corresponding to the second group, in which the majority of the m. hominis isolates were found. reproducibility of the quantification of dna in the clinical specimens was analyzed in  <dig> negative patient samples. four μl of samples were spiked with  <dig> μl of pg <dig> dna of known concentration . the six μl were added to the lightcycler pcr reaction. no inhibition was observed .

in some dneasy treated clinical samples a slight fluorescence response was seen at the very late pcr cycle. to analyze whether this slight fluorescence response was unspecific, different dneasy samples were analyzed. we used different concentrations of human dna from "mycoplasma free" hep <dig> cells, which were purified with blood & cell culture dna mini kit, and these samples did not give a positive fluorescence signal when run in lightcycler pcr . in addition the results showed that there was no cross-reaction to human dna. however, when dna free water and standard dilutions of the human dna extracted by the blood & cell culture dna mini kit were treated with dneasy tissue kit, we experienced a slight fluorescence signal at the very late cycle numbers. even dna free water gave a positive signal . the calculated copy numbers were between 1– <dig> copies/μl. the melting curve analysis showed an atypical flat and broad melting curve with the melting peak below the range of mycoplasma hominis isolates .

clinical samples showing the low concentration  also had the flat melting curve with the melting peak below 61°c  and were therefore considered as negative. one additional sample  had an average concentration of  <dig> copies/μl, but when comparing the melting curve data, it had a melting curve identical to the dneasy treated water and was therefore considered negative. there was thus 100% agreement between cultivation and detection by real-time pcr.

lightcycler pcr on proteinase k treated clinical samples
to additionally confirm that samples which gave a slightly positive fluorescence signal in lightcycler pcr after dneasy treatment were not containing m. hominis dna, we analysed proteinase k treated samples from those patients by the lightcycler pcr. none of the samples gave a positive fluorescence signal. after confirming that all samples were negative, we spiked  <dig> μl of each sample with  <dig> μl of pg <dig> dna of  <dig> copies/μl, as the control for inhibition. none of the proteinase k treated samples showed inhibition. this clearly indicates that those samples were negative.

discussion
a rapid quantitative real-time pcr for detection of m. hominis from cervical swab samples was developed. to our knowledge it is the first lightcycler pcr protocol where quantification of m. hominis is combined with melting curve assay. the lightcycler pcr reproducibility was able to detect down to ten copies/reaction of the genomic pg <dig> dna. all other  <dig> m. hominis isolates were positive in the assay. additionally, isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  which based on melting temperature belong to the two other groups than pg <dig>  were used to document detection limits of m. hominis isolates. similarly to pg <dig>  the detection limits were  <dig> copies/μl, equals to  <dig> copies per reaction for both isolates.

the average efficiency was high, but small differences were seen. this can be caused by different factors such as presence of inhibitors in the sample and treatment of the sample.

the artificially constructed samples consisting of pg <dig> dna and coloured bea and sp- <dig> media showed that these media inhibited the pcr reaction indicating that it was crucial to wash the pellets of other mycoplasma species with pbs. additionally, a spiking assay where dna from other mycoplasmas was used together with dna from pg <dig> showed that there was no inhibition in the proteinase k treated samples.

since swab samples may contain pcr inhibitors we introduced the dneasy procedure to additionally purify dna from proteinase k treated clinical samples. analysis of the ten negative clinical samples spiked with dna from pg <dig>  showed no inhibition after dneasy treatment.

we experienced, however, some slight fluorescence response in the very late cycle number, which corresponds to the low concentration seen in dneasy treated water or hep <dig> cells  and flat melting curves with lower melting temperature than those of m. hominis isolates . dneasy treated patient samples that gave such a weak fluorescence signal were considered as negative. additionally, using the original proteinase k treated patient samples, for those patients that gave a weak fluorescence signal after dneasy treatment, we did not see any reaction with lightcycler pcr. this strongly indicates that such slight fluorescence response is generated only in the dneasy treated samples.

a previous study showed that women with bacterial vaginosis showed presence of m. hominis in  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % of women with normal microbial flora  <cit> . since none of our patients had bacterial vaginosis we had expected approximately 8% of our samples to be positive. we found two positive samples that were confirmed to be positive by the culture and had a high concentration of dna by lightcycler pcr . the low number of positive patients  was surprising but comparable with a previous study made on patients undergoing the in-vitro fertilization  <cit> .

comparison of the number of dna copies and ccu showed that the ccu was lower than the number of dna copies. this can be explained by the presence of dead bacteria in the samples.

even though the assay was designed for quantification, the variability in the melting peaks gave additional information of m. hominis. differences in the melting temperatures between m. hominis isolates prove heterogeneity of the housekeeping gene sequence. the tm value determines how well the sequence of probes matches the sequence of template dna, and it will decrease if mismatched dna is amplified. single mismatch can decrease the tm from 1°c up to 30°c  <cit>  depending on many factors, such as ph, duplex length and g + c content. this kind of analysis is used in detection of subtypes of herpes simplex virus, since the tm discriminates between two different subtypes  <cit> . in the present study, tm of the clinical samples can suggest to which group of isolates they belong and how different they are from the pg <dig> template dna. in this study, patient samples nos.  <dig> and  <dig> had melting peaks similar to isolates from the second and largest group.

the real-time technology where measurement of the fluorescence emitted during amplicon production is performed during each pcr cycle is considered as a breakthrough in pcr. conventional pcr is an open, contamination-susceptible system where it is necessary to transfer the amplified product to other detection systems to confirm a positive result. real-time pcr benefits by a closed system in which formation of a product is measured immediately without transfer  <cit> . interpretation of lightcycler pcr results, presented as graphs and calculation of crossing points, introduces many advantages, but such a parameter of real-time pcr should be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
lightcycler pcr appears very promising for detection of organisms that are difficult to culture or whose growth is slow. we have developed a quantitative, specific lightcycler protocol for detection of m. hominis, which offers rapid diagnosis of one hour after dna extraction. the dna extraction method used was not the best choice as unspecific fluorescence did occur in the late number of cycles. results from cultivation and lightcycler pcr were identical. the method is both sensitive and specific. all tested isolates gave a positive fluorescence response, and final amplification and quantification was performed in closed tubes, which reduces the risk of contamination. the described target gap gene sequence should be preferred to more varying parts. a small variation in this part of the gap gene among different m. hominis isolates was observed by the melting curve analysis.
