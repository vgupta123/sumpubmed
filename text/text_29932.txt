BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile  is present in almost all human environments and is a potential zoonotic pathogen that can be isolated from a variety of animal species  <cit> . it is the most commonly diagnosed cause of antimicrobial- and hospital-associated diarrhoea  <cit>  and is an emerging cause of community-associated disease  <cit> . the presence of cd in animals, including those that come in close contact with humans as pets or through the food chain  <cit> , and the significant overlap between the types of cd isolated from humans and animals  <cit> , has lead to suggestion that cd might be a zoonotic and foodborne pathogen  <cit> .

recognition of different potential sources of cd transmission remains a pressing clinical and investigative quest. migratory birds travel between continents twice each year and are responsible for the transmission of several pathogens  <cit>  and/or disease vectors  <cit> . the world’s largest bird migration system is the palaearctic–african flyway, which involves an estimated  <dig> billion passerines and near-passerines migrating between the european continent and sub-saharan africa  <cit> .

an epidemiological study on mostly migrating passerine birds in europe suggested that they are unlikely to serve as a carrier or reservoir of cd  <cit> . however, the study  <cit>  was conducted in the region where barn swallows  were not congregating during their migration south, and included only garden birds unlikely to dwell in habitats intensively cultivated by humans. on the other hand, barn swallows, come in close contact with human habitats  <cit> , as do house sparrows , which are a non-migrating passerine bird, that have been associated with cd when sampled on pig farms  <cit> .

barn swallows are among most common and widespread migratory birds in the palaearctic. in europe they most commonly nest in cattle farms inside the barns or stables, which had a significant evolutionary effect on barn swallow biology with regards to their nesting habits. any changes in their environment significantly affect their population  <cit> . its habit of nesting in buildings associated with human habitation has made this species one of the most familiar bird species in the world  <cit>  as well as a potential source for international and local cd perpetuation. the aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of cd in barn swallows, and to characterize cd isolates.

methods
sampling of barn swallows was conducted once in september  <dig> in the central part of slovenia  in an area identified as a barn swallow congregation point during their autumn migration across europe . one hundred seventy-five  barn swallows were captured with mist nets and placed individually in clean custom made hot pressed plastic containers with air holes. bird faeces, if present, were collected from containers using sterile gloves  after the birds were removed for standard general inspection, ringing and release to continue with their migration. faeces were transferred into  <dig> ml sterile tubes  and stored at -20°c until analysed for the presence of cd spores.

the study was carried out with animal ethics approval by the ministry of the environment and spatial planning .

clostridium difficile culture
entire samples were inoculated into  <dig> ml of cd moxalactam norfloxacin  enrichment broth  containing  <dig> % sodium taurocholate. anaerobic incubation at 37°c lasted for  <dig> days. an aliquot of broth was transferred to a new vial and an equal amount of anhydrous alcohol was added to each sample. this was followed by a  <dig> min incubation at room temperature, centrifugation  and inoculation of the pellets onto cdmn  agar. further incubation in an anaerobic chamber for  <dig> days at 37°c was followed by another  <dig> days if necessary. isolation and identification of cd was based on the characteristic morphology and odour of the colonies, gram stain and the presence of the l-proline aminopeptidase activity . one single colony for each isolate was subcultured and stored at -80°c and re-cultured prior to molecular analysis.

molecular analysis
extraction of dna was done on pure cultures after they were obtained from blood agar with a chelex resin-based dna extraction commercial kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions. extracted dna was used as template for further molecular analysis. ribotyping was performed as previously described by  <cit> . ribotpyes were assigned visually based on comparison with an internal library of ribotypes as well as reference strains from the cardiff ecdc reference library. testing for genes encoding toxins a  and b  was performed by pcr as previously described by  <cit> . the presence of the gene encoding the binding component of the binary toxin  was detected as described in  <cit> .

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> samples were taken from  <dig> juvenile and  <dig> adult barn swallows. seven  samples were positive for cd; 7/ <dig>  juveniles and 0/ <dig> adults. five  isolates were toxigenic. all five toxigenic isolates possessed tcda and tcdb while two also possessed cdta. clostridium difficile isolates that were toxin a, b and cdt  positive, were identified as ribotype  <dig>  single isolates of ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were also identified. the remaining three ribotypes, one of which was toxigenic, had not been previously identified in this laboratory or documented in the available cardiff ecdc collection .

discussion
this is the first study investigating barn swallow as a possible source of cd for farm animals and humans. in the past, there has been increasing concern about animals as potential cd reservoirs and sources of human exposure  <cit> . of particular note is the finding of ribotype  <dig>  this strain is common in food animals  <cit>  and has been reported as an emerging and increasing cause of community-associated clostridium difficile infection  in humans  <cit> . two of the three other toxigenic ribotypes identified in this study  can be found both in humans and animals  <cit> . three new cd ribotypes were also identified , one possessing a + b + cdt- .

it was interesting that cd was only found in juvenile birds. the sample population in this study was predominantly juvenile birds, which is in concordance with the expected ratio of juvenile birds on migration   <cit> . in most studied animal species, cd tends to predominate in younger animals  <cit> . there is no evidence that cd causes disease in barn swallows.

currently, the epidemiology of community-associated cdi is poorly understood. food animals and food have been suggested as sources of human exposure  <cit> ; however, other potential forms of exposure in the community must be considered. while the high prevalence of cd in some farm animal groups clearly indicates that they could be reservoirs of cd, the potential for other animals to act as a source of cd from farms to the broader human or animal population is intriguing. the biology of barn swallows potentially makes them a very efficient vector for cd dissemination. they are the most common and widespread migratory bird in europe and cohabit with farm animals and humans  <cit> .

passerine birds were previously not determined to be the source of cd; however, only passerines unlikely to come in close contact with humans have been investigated  <cit> . in contrary, house sparrows, a non-migrating passerine, had previously been associated with cd on pig farms in the netherlands  <cit> . european barn swallows, the species studied here, preferably nest within the cattle barns during warm months of the year, and spend the winter in sub-saharan africa. some can migrate to arabia and to the indian sub-continent  <cit> . in our study, a total of 4% of all captured and sampled barn swallows were positive for cd, which reflects the prevalence of adult cattle in some reports. given the presence of cd in the bovine population, with reported prevalence of  <dig> - <dig> % in adult cattle and  <dig> -51% in calves  <cit>  and the nesting locations of barn swallows, it is certainly plausible that these birds could acquire cd on farms. interestingly, to date, including this study, cd was isolated only from wild birds that are associated with intensively farmed habitats  <cit> . therefore, it is more likely that barn swallows have a more indicative than perpetuating role in cd epidemiology.

CONCLUSIONS
results of this study showed that barn swallows could potentially be a source of cd in humans and animals. during their congregation at migration destinations inter-individual and interspecies horizontal transmission can occur  <cit> . however, based on this and previous studies on the prevalence of cd in wild passerine birds  <cit> , and studies associated with farm animals and humans  <cit> , barn swallows may more realistically be an indicator and not the source of the contamination of cd in the environment. it seems that intensive farming and hospital environment are the sources of cd, and only humans and/or animals associated with such environment perpetuate cd.
