BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing systems have boosted genetics in the last few years. the reduction of costs, wet-lab workflow complexity and the gain of read length has led to an enormous increase in sequencing projects and sequencing data
 <cit> . roche/ <dig> life sciences is one of the major players in the ngs field as their technology of pyrosequencing allows for the longest possible reads of all 2nd generation sequencing techniques with further technological improvements proposed, moreover, two different sized platforms allow for scalability
 <cit> . this technology is based on dna templates immobilized on beads which are loaded onto a picotiterplate . subsequently, nucleotides flow over this plate in periodic cycles and get incorporated if complementary to the template strand. an enzyme cascade is activated, leading to the release of photons. these photons are detected by an ultra-sensitive ccd camera. lengths of homopolymers  are determined by the amount of emitted light
 <cit> , especially long homopolymers are a huge challenge of the  <dig> technology itself, bioinformatics and analysis respectively interpretation
 <cit> .

it is a logical consequence to follow ngs from the basic research applications to routine diagnostic assays
 <cit> . using ngs for human leukocyte antigen  typing is one of the most evolving fields of application and pushing forward for routine diagnostics
 <cit> . our lab is certified by the european federation for immunogenetics for hla typing and has years of experience in hla typing and next-generation sequencing
 <cit> . for transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells dna based, high-resolution typing of hla is an absolute necessity in order to gain a best possible histocompatibility to reduce the risk of a severe graft-versus-host-disease
 <cit> . most recently, we have demonstrated ngs hla typing as feasible for routine diagnostics
 <cit> .

for diagnostic applications it is essential to know possible errors in workflow and data analysis. there are already implemented mechanisms controlling and dealing with errors in a quality management controlled laboratory. every next-generation sequencing platform and technique has its own application dependent error profile. several groups have estimated errors for special fields of genomics, including bacterial, viral and antibody sequencing
 <cit> .

here we present a detailed error assessment for sequences of ngs hla typing on a  <dig> platform. we analyzed multiple runs and point out the level of safety for diagnostics ngs applications on the basis of error occurrences and if any of them are recurring and linked to sequence motifs.

RESULTS
performance, accuracy and errors
taking all six runs together,  <dig>  reads passed built in quality filtering
 <cit> , with a total of  <dig> , <dig> bases sequenced and average read length of  <dig> base pairs.

raw run performances  of the six runs are shown in table 
 <dig>  together with filter metrics and read statistics.

raw run performance of six runs is shown.

 <dig> % of the generated raw reads could be aligned to hla reference sequences and were used for further analysis. after trimming primers and reducing reads to exon information,  <dig> , <dig> bases  were taken into account when calling variants and determining errors.  <dig> variants in the exon regions were defined as true variants, known by sanger sequence based typing  and additional pseudogen analysis. besides,  <dig>  variants were detected and categorized as errors.

 <dig>  reads had at least one error, therefore  <dig> % of all reads contain errors in their coding region and on average one read had  <dig>  errors. after applying the error correction tool acacia, errors still remained in  <dig> % of all reads
 <cit> .

the number of reads containing one error was multiplied with the corresponding length of the error resulting in  <dig>  bases being erroneous. the total error rate of  <dig> % was defined by the percentage of wrong bases in the number of total exon bases, where insertions account for  <dig> %, deletions for  <dig> % and substitutions for  <dig> %. insertions had an average length of  <dig>  bases, deletions  <dig>  bases and substitutions one base; summarized, errors had a length of  <dig>  bases.

 <dig> % of these errors were detected in all six runs, meaning  <dig> % reproducible errors  associated with  <dig>  bases.

quality scores
average quality score , estimated by the gs junior software
 <cit> ) of all sequenced bases  is  <dig> ; counting only bases used for hla typing average quality score is  <dig> . average quality score of error positions was  <dig> , meaning an accuracy  of  <dig> %, quality score is less than or equal to  <dig> at  <dig> % of incorrect bases. the adjacent base quality scores of a neighborhood of  <dig> bases averaged was precisely higher at  <dig>  . boxplot of quality scores in figure 
 <dig> compares the six runs on error position and five base average, quality scores of runs  <dig> and  <dig> have slightly better quality scores on both parts.

homopolymers
 <dig> % of errors were outside of a homopolymer region,  <dig> % were adjacent to a n-mer of length  <dig> or longer. figure 
 <dig> displays portion of homopolymer lengths associated with errors compared to the percentages of homopolymers in analyzed sequences with given length. correlation of homopolymer’s length and quality values is - <dig>  which is highly significant , figure 
 <dig> illustrates correlation with boxplots where base quality scores decrease with the length of homopolymers.

read position
taking into account errors adjacent to homopolymeric regions, there is no significant peak in the distribution along the read distance. the distributions along the read positions regarding specific amplicons corresponding to hla exons are given in additional file
 <dig>  homopolymeric associated errors have no significant effect on these positions. figure 
 <dig> shows the distribution of errors over the read length. base quality over the read lengths respectively the progress of a run is plotted in figure 
 <dig>  a characteristic development over sequence length is apparent.

discussion
run performances
several publications analyze accuracy and errors in  <dig> sequencing data. huse et al.
 <cit>  analyzed bacterial 16s rdna with the older gs <dig> platform and affirmed their basic foundings for standard chemistry
 <cit> , prabakaran et al.
 <cit>  characterized errors in a small portion of  <dig>  antibody sequences and gilles et al.
 <cit>  used control dna fragments of the  <dig> workflow for error assessment. as stated previously
 <cit> , error characteristics is sequence motive dependant, hence every application needs its own error profile.

run performance of the gs junior platform is stated to be approximately  <dig>  reads per run for shotgun sequencing
 <cit> .  <dig>  reads are expected from amplicon experiments
 <cit> , most of our runs in this study do not reach this number of sequences, resulting in average  <dig>  reads, however, being sufficient for hla genotyping of  <dig> samples .

per base error rates
the used enzyme for amplification has an error rate of  <dig> ×10- <dig> <cit> . accordingly, approximately  <dig>  erroneous bases in our experiment are due to pcr artifacts. these bases contribute  <dig> % to our total error rate. our error rate of  <dig> % differs significantly from already published error rates:  <dig> % standard chemistry
 <cit> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for titanium chemistry
 <cit> . the high error rate of  <dig> % can be explained through the use of the  <dig> control fragments for error analysis. considering  homopolymers being the weak point of  <dig> systems, they are overrepresented in the control fragments in contrast to natural dna sequences. in lind et al. an error rate of  <dig> % for a shotgun hla sequencing approach is given, sequenced with standard chemistry
 <cit> . since gs <dig> many improvements in protocol, reagents and software have been made to the  <dig> technology. additionally, reads tend to become error prone towards their end
 <cit> , the  trimmed analysis furthermore reduces possible errors due to errors being rather located at the reads’ ends. due to this analysis strategy, 19% of the produced output is not analyzed.

insertions  are the most frequent errors followed by substitutions  and deletions , the substitution rate is even lower than for illumina’s miseq system stated in loman et al.
 <cit> . both publications mention insertions as the most frequent errors. in contrast to previously published error data substitutions account for the second frequent errors, including pcr or application specific errors. gilles et al. reported a seven times lower substitution rate than deletions originating from the overrepresented homopolymers.

 <dig> % of all reads were free from errors, consistent with huse et al.
 <cit> . hence, without denoising
 <cit>  or smoothing
 <cit>  a loss of one third of data must be taken into account. with error correction additional  <dig> % of reads  could be recovered, resulting in a quarter of sequences still exhibiting errors. we use a conservative approach without additional modifications of the data to prevent introduction of false positive mutations. the majority of reads containing errors  has less than three wrong bases. the reduced error rate in our setting is the reason for the satisfying average error per read rate of  <dig>  errors and the average length of  <dig>  bases per error.

for  <dig>  variants  there was evidence  supporting the mutation in both sequencing directions, in accordance with challis et al.
 <cit> .

read position and motifs
the occurrence of erroneous bases was highly connected to read respectively reference position,  <dig> % of them occurred at the same positions when resequencing. there is strong evidence that errors are also highly linked to special sequence positions and dna patterns. as a result the individual error rates of the six runs only slightly differ from each other respectively the given average values. vandenbroucke et al. indicated that every amplicon has its own error profile
 <cit> .

based on our examination we can state that more errors are located in the second half of the read than in the other half, indicated by a median error position of  <dig> with an average read length of  <dig> 

quality scores
quality values calculated from the averaged error rates were compared to the average quality values estimated by the gs junior at the same positions . below values of  <dig>  the empirical rate is higher than the estimated value; above  <dig> the gs junior overestimates its own performance .

the distribution of quality scores along the read distance  of all runs exhibits a very equal pattern, showing that some regions have valleys  while others have peaks . the overall pattern with a considerable decrease at around  <dig> bp is typical for all gs junior runs; positions and power of peaks are library specific and highly reproducible. the quality scores of surrounding error positions correspond to the overall run performance that was slightly better in run  <dig> and  <dig> and below expectations for run  <dig> due to variations of the complex workflow and chemistry.

comparing the quality values of the actual error position to their neighborhood  reveals that the erroneous base is represented by a quality valley. figure 
 <dig> reveals that quality values of areas of errors are below other positions, the actual error position is even lower.

homopolymers
homopolymers form a major challenge in base calling algorithms in the  <dig> sequencing systems, thus, errors turning up are highly connected to homopolymer regions
 <cit> . on a first glance  <dig> % of errors outside homopolymeric regions may seem contrary. considering the distribution of homopolymers with given lengths in the reference sequences for hla, it is significant  that homopolymers are more attractive to form errors than single bases . the length of homopolymers correlates with a decrease of accuracy drops in general, with the exception of 2-mers having the best quality scores at error positions, displayed in figure 
 <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present a detailed error characterization of  <dig> sequencing using data from a diagnostic assay. in our amplicon sequencing approach exactly  <dig> % of total bases used for hla typing are erroneous. this error rate supports and allows the benefit of typing hla with  <dig> next generation sequencing. although amplicon sequencing is considered as more sophisticated than shotgun from a bioinformatics perspective
 <cit> , the presented data are even better than previously published shotgun approaches
 <cit> .

several software products are able to correct errors, however most of them are specialized on a specific application and sequence context. moreover, if error models are already known, many tools are able to simulate sequencing data with a reference sequence but without taking neighboring sequence motifs into account
 <cit> .

additionally, knowing error rates allows for the reduction of sequence depth needed for a certain accuracy
 <cit> , furthermore allowing diagnostics to be more cost-effective. the given data outperforms previous publications using test fragments, non human samples or outdated software or reagents.
