BACKGROUND
the mammalian innate immune system, comprised of macrophages, provides a front line of defense against pathogens. infection or dysfunction of macrophages results in clinical situations like septic shock or chronic inflammatory disease such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. under normal steady-state conditions, monocytes migrate randomly from blood to various organs or body cavities and differentiate into macrophages through coordinate expression of numerous genes. during a local infection, migration of blood monocytes into the inflamed tissues is accelerated, and subsequent differentiation into macrophage occurs rapidly  <cit> . upon the entry of microorganisms, conserved structures found in a broad range of pathogens are recognized by toll-like receptors  of macrophages. phagocytic macrophages are activated to produce inflammatory cytokines  and chemokines . signaling pathways triggered by individual tlrs involve recruitment of adaptor molecules  and autocrine production of ifnbeta. two distinct cascades, myd <dig> dependent and myd <dig> independent , lead to activation of immuno-regulatory transcription factors  to modulate inflammatory gene expression  <cit> .

transcriptional regulators play important roles during developmental processes, and were described in a variety of well-studied differentiation systems. during the process of hematopoietic differentiation of monocytes, functions of transcription factors encompass up regulation of genes specific to the lineage and repression of lineage-inappropriate genes by forming distinct protein complexes  <cit> . similarly, cell-type-specific gene expression during macrophage differentiation and function is a result of complex transcriptional regulation by the interplay between endogenous transcription factors and external signals, and also by the networks of individual transcription factors. whatever other mechanisms can modulate their activity, expression of specific transcription factors during differentiation process is likely to be regulated transcriptionally. several transcription factors including mafb, egrs, nfkb, ap <dig>  irfs and bcl <dig> that control various stages of macrophage development or function have already been identified  <cit> . however, only a genome-wide expression study will be able to identify all transcriptional regulators, gene regulatory networks and help to understand molecular mechanisms underlying relevant immune disease.

furthermore, the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation of immune system has been increasingly studied. in activated macrophages stimulated by lps, the transcriptional response has been attributed to the expression and function of chromatin remodeling genes, mainly related to histone modifications  <cit> . timely coordinated relationship regarding transition of chromatin structure, nucleosome remodeling and transcription factors are known to be important  <cit> . under such a circumstance, it is of utmost importance to study genome-wide gene expression changes in model systems that make it feasible to continue investigating and dissecting underlying molecular mechanisms.

the use of a model system circumvents many problems including available cell numbers, high cost and tedious procedure, generally encountered while having to work with primary blood cells. however, the validity of any single myeloid model system has never been fully verified. among several myeloid cell lines , u <dig> cells and thp <dig> cells are the most widely used models for investigating monocytic differentiation and subsequent biological functions of differentiated cells  <cit> . in contrast to thp- <dig> cells at less mature stage due to their blood leukemic origin, u <dig> cells of histocytic lymphoma origin are arrested in a more advanced stage of differentiation . various stimuli , either alone or in combination, have been attributed to induce their terminal differentiation into monocytes or mature macrophages. upon differentiation, u <dig> cells acquire a large repertoire of macrophage function through the concerted expression of numerous genes. differentiated u <dig> cells can be further stimulated with lps  to mimic inflammatory response of activated macrophages.

in this study, we employed the u <dig> model system combined with a crna hybridization-based whole genome array to analyze genome-wide expression patterns during monocyte-macrophage differentiation and lps-responsive activation of differentiated cells. the identification of novel transcriptional regulators intensifies directions for further investigation of the molecular mechanism involving common regulatory networks and epigenetic mechanisms.

RESULTS
u <dig> cells were differentiated into monocyte and macrophage-like cells
u <dig> cells have been widely used as a model to investigate a variety of biological processes related to monocyte and macrophage function. here, we used either the hormonally active form of vitamin d <dig>  to differentiate u <dig> cells toward monocytes, or pma  to induce differentiation into a macrophage-like phenotype. both pma and vitd <dig> were known to induce cell cycle arrest prior to proceeding into differentiation stage. pma-treated cells exhibit apparent growth arrest already  <dig> hrs after the addition of pma and almost 100% adherence of cells after  <dig> hrs. cells then tend to loose adhesiveness gradually afterwards. growth arrest phenotype was much less prominent with vitd3-treated cells that continued moderate proliferation even after addition of the reagent . cells differentiated for  <dig> hrs by each inducer were used for further analysis and lps stimulation.

fluorescence activated cell-sorting  was carried out to monitor two surface proteins characteristic of differentiated u <dig> cells :  cd <dig>  serving as a marker for both monocyte and macrophage, is involved in lps recognition and facilitating lps contact with tlr <dig> receptor;  cd11b, serving as a macrophage marker, is involved in phagocytosis of bacteria. cd <dig> expression was increased after vitd <dig> differentiation, yielding the characteristics of monocyte-like cell type. this result is also in accordance with mrna expression, and is certainly indicative of enhanced sensitivity of these cells to lps stimulation  <cit> . cd11b expression was increased only after pma inducement, indicating macrophage-like differentiation, meanwhile no cd <dig> induction was observed with these cells.

according to well-known molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage activation, tnfalpha is a gene product of myd88-dependent pathway  while ifnbeta is an autocrine product destined to launch myd88-independent pathway specific for macrophages  <cit> . in the case of sepsis, persisting and systemic release of tnfalpha by activated macrophages can cause organ failure and death as a result of septic shock. inevitably, it would require tight regulation. in order to demonstrate successful differentiation leading to activated macrophages, mrna accumulation of tnfalpha and ifnbeta was analyzed by real-time pcr. the result from stimulation of pma and vitd <dig> differentiated cells with  <dig> Î¼g/ml lps is shown in figure  <dig>  immediate expression  of tnfalpha was common to all samples . with control u <dig> cells and vitd3-differentiated cells, decreasing production of tnfalpha mrna was observed across the later period of stimulation . pma differentiated cells shows a dramatically decreased tnfalpha expression after  <dig> hrs but increased again at  <dig> hrs. this distinct biphasic behavior is a manifestation that macrophage-like cells possess an intrinsic 'automatic-bridle' system to modulate production of this cytokine in a time dependent manner. stimulation at the lower concentration of lps  showed the same pattern except that the biphasic behavior was extended up to  <dig> hours. time dependent mrna accumulation of ifnbeta was also characteristic for pma differentiated cells representative of macrophages. initially, a moderate increase of mrna was observed . afterwards, further increase was prominently induced . by the time of  <dig> hrs, the mrna level was maintained at the level comparable to initial stage. on the contrary, control u <dig> cells and vitd <dig> differentiated cells manifest much less prominent accumulation of ifnbeta after both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, and are completely devoid of it by the time of  <dig> hrs. it indicates that these cells are inefficient  and finally lacking  in ifnbeta induced myd88-independent pathway.

differential gene expression of u <dig> cells manifests functional macrophage phenotype
whole transcriptome expression profiling was performed with two biological replicates and two technical replicates from each of seven different samples  while satisfying each set of replicates on separate slides. to evaluate the consistency of data across biological or technical replicates, correlation coefficients were calculated. in all cases, the correlation between biological replicates and also technical replicates were higher than  <dig>  . during pma differentiation, there was a shift of correlation coefficients from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , indicating  <dig> % to  <dig> % of gene features contained on the array were differentially regulated. there appeared only  <dig> %  of change between  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs of pma differentiation. this shows that the cells were already reached a state of full differentiation after  <dig> hrs. it is noteworthy that additional  <dig> % of features were promptly induced within  <dig> hrs of subsequent lps stimulation.

gene expression of differentiated or stimulated cells was evaluated in comparison to undifferentiated u <dig> cells. differential gene expression was considered 'significant' when the normalized intensity ratio of sample vs control was > <dig>   or <- <dig> , respectively . at  <dig> hrs of pma differentiation,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes down regulated. after  <dig> hrs,  <dig> genes were additionally up regulated while  <dig> genes were down regulated. by the time of  <dig> hrs, total  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes down regulated. after  <dig> hrs of subsequent lps stimulation,  <dig> additional genes were up regulated while  <dig> additional genes were down regulated. with vitd <dig> differentiation, only  <dig> genes were significantly up regulated while  <dig> genes down regulated. the complete list of gene expression profiling is available in additional file  <dig> 

top  <dig> most highly up regulated genes, sorted by  <dig> hrs of pma differentiation, are shown in table  <dig>  among them are several genes well known to be related with differentiation process as well as monocyte and macrophage functions. this involves proteins known to be involved in the differentiation process , cytokine transporter like a2m, chemokines like ccl <dig> and ip <dig> as well as matrix metalloproteinase protein such as mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> involved in the proteolysis of structural and adhesive matrixes.

the column designation indicates different time points of differentiation with pma , vitd <dig>  and subsequent activation of pma differentiated cells  by lps . the numbers denote fold change after normalization of illumina array data. the order of genes was sorted by pma  <dig> hrs sample in descendent manner.

temporal pattern of array gene expression can be categorized
large scale comparisons of differential gene expression profiles between different experimental conditions  have potential to identify co-regulated and/or inter-related genes. such categories reflect their functional relationships and can help to identify common transcriptional control mechanisms. transcription factors in such groups of genes may be responsible for regulation of the genes in the same group. beside genes not affected, three distinct groups could be categorized. nine examples of time dependent gene expression were illustrated in figure  <dig>  il <dig> , cxcl <dig>  and nur <dig>  represent a group of genes that are highly up regulated only after lps-responsive activation. ncf <dig>  a2m, mmp <dig>  all of which related to macrophage function, and transcription factor mef2a represent a second group of genes whose expression was constantly up regulated during differentiation period and also activation. ctsg and tnfsf13b, represent a third group of genes specifically down regulated during macrophage differentiation. both proteins are related to functions in neutrophils and b cells respectively.

validity of expression analysis was verified by real timepcr
among  <dig> selected genes validated by real time pcr , were cytokines and chemokines , inflammatory effector molecules , surface antigens , signaling molecules  and transcription factors.

 <dig> genes representative of cytokines, chemokines, signaling molecules, transcription factors and histone modifiers were selected. na  denotes data not available from array experiment. *rq = 2-ddct in which ddct = dct - dct. dct denotes ct value normalized to gapdh.

the fold change of greater than  <dig> from the array correspond to a factor of greater than  <dig> rq fold  based on real time pcr . likewise, array fold change between  <dig> and  <dig> usually fell within the range of  <dig> to  <dig> rq fold while low fold change around  <dig> or  <dig> were equal to various range from less than  <dig> up to  <dig> rq fold. taking an example of lps stimulated sample, confirmation rate of up or down regulation by real time pcr result was 100%. with pma samples, a few cases of inconsistency, as with il <dig>  il1a and ccl <dig>  were observed

identification of transcriptional regulators
transcriptional regulators already known to be involved in monocytic-lineage differentiation  are constantly up regulated during the differentiation process and subsequent activation . previously unknown factors  were also shown to be significantly and constantly up regulated. of the most interesting new identified transcription factors are proteins belonging to the mef <dig>  family. moreover, a target gene  of mef <dig> during t cell apoptosis and postsynaptic differentiation were also up regulated. this is in line with previous reports  <cit> . among the population of transacting proteins identified, several factors acting as transcriptional repressors  and histone modifying proteins  were verified. histone deacetylases  were previously implicated as key molecules to repress production of pro-inflammatory gene expression, thus prevent excessive inflammatory responses  <cit> . klf <dig> and klf <dig> have been recently described as critical regulators controlling monocyte differentiation and proinflammatory activation  <cit> . both factors are validated to be up regulated by real time pcr . this together with up regulation of klf <dig> suggests importance of kruppel-like family of transcription factors  in the differentiation and function of macrophages. upon lps stimulation, nur <dig>  fos, jun, stat <dig>  irf family, nfkb family and smad family show significant up regulation, thus confirm their classical role in macrophage function of inflammatory response. one of the main physiological roles of nfkb family is in the development and functioning of the immune system by regulating transcription of cytokines and antimicrobial effectors as well as genes that regulate cellular differentiation, survival and proliferation  <cit> . consistently, relb, crel, nfkb <dig> and nfkb <dig> are significantly induced upon lps stimulation, thus confirming the validity of u <dig> model system.

cross validation between u <dig> cells and primary blood monocytes
various macrophage populations from different tissues of the body exhibit different morphological and functional phenotypes. two cytokines, macrophage colony-stimulating factor  and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , are known to promote differentiation of monocytes into macrophages with distinct phenotypes existing in vivo. it is known that m-csf differentiated macrophages are very similar to peritoneal macrophages  <cit> . as a counterpart of pma-differentiated u <dig> cells, m-csf differentiated macrophages were generated from primary blood monocytes, and further activated with lps . real time pcr shows that both cd <dig> and cd11b were up regulated with m-csf differentiated macrophages . additionally, monocyte-derived macrophages manifest down regulation of tnfalpha in contrast to pma-differentiated u <dig> cells where up regulation was shown.

expression data of  <dig> top regulated transcriptional regulators from u <dig> cells including activators, repressors, histone modifying enzymes and histone variants were subjected to cross validation in comparison to primary human monocytes derived macrophages . two distinct groups of genes could be identified . within the first group,  <dig> %  of the genes  were differentially expressed during differentiation and/or activation in both u <dig> cells and primary m-csf/macrophages. interestingly, both cell types manifest moderate up regulation  of h2av. the expression consistency of bcl <dig>  egr <dig> and fos depended upon the stage of cells . despite the generally known concept that nur <dig> is induced only after lps stimulation, one individual donor manifest up regulation already upon macrophage differentiation. nevertheless, these factors are most likely to be true regulators in the differentiation and function of monocytic cells. a second group of genes  showed a very opposite or no differential gene expression . among these factors, tcf7l <dig> is noteworthy. it is a ubiquitous transcription factor in wnt signaling pathway, but has not been connected to any immune cell gene transcription up to date.

* primary monocytes were isolated from the blood of two healthy individuals designated as donor  <dig> and donor  <dig>  differentiated by m-csf into macrophages and stimulated by  <dig> Î¼g/ml lps. degree of individual heterogeneity between two donors was expressed as nearly equal , equal with different propensity , and opposite .

cellular localization of transcription factors
as a step toward verifying actual involvement of selected transcription factors in activating gene program, protein localization was traced and quantified in cytosolic and nucleic fraction by western blot. in order to probe  <dig> proteins among top regulated transcription factors, twenty different antibodies were tested by elisa and western blot. western blot could detect proteins in cytosolic and nuclear fraction with a clear tendency toward nucleic fraction. three antibodies were determined to meet the criteria  that allow their use for protein quantification. figure  <dig> shows the results of western blot with these three antibodies. mef <dig> antibody recognizes three members  simultaneously. one specific band of about  <dig> kda in size  was detected in cytosolic fraction while two bands of similar size and intensity  were detected in nucleic fraction . while expression of cytosolic proteins appears to be decreased, nucleic proteins show  <dig> ~ <dig> fold induction during macrophage differentiation and subsequent activation by lps. up regulation of proteins were comparable to mrna induction of  <dig> ~ <dig> rq fold . both nfkb1/p <dig> and tcf7l <dig> antibodies produced specific bands with nucleic fractions only. corresponding to mrna expression of  <dig>  rq fold  and  <dig>  rq fold , protein expression of tcf7l <dig> was clearly induced  while lps sample shows moderate induction of less than  <dig> fold. prominent induction of nfkb1/p <dig> protein after lps stimulation is also in line with its classical role during inflammatory responses. with all antibodies tested by elisa, fluorescence detection of antibody binding to protein substrate was observable only with nucleic fraction .

discussion
u <dig> cells as valid model system
the relatively small number of genes up and down regulated after vitd <dig> differentiation is a strong indication that u <dig> cells used in this study are nearly proximal to functional monocytes . despite both cd <dig> and cd11b are induced in monocyte-derived macrophages, u <dig> cells-derived macrophages manifest up regulation of cd11b alone . however, lack of cd <dig> induction should not impair the essential function representing macrophages. cd <dig> binds lps to facilitate recognition by tlr <dig>  but does not participate directly in signaling. tlr <dig> alone can function as a singular signaling receptor for lps. moreover, lps signaling in u <dig> cells can bypass the necessity of cd <dig> component of receptor complex due to high concentration of lps  used in this study. the abundance of tnfalpha mrna prior to differentiation was higher with primary monocytes  when compared to u <dig> cells as manifested by initial ct value. taken together, the lack of cd <dig> expression and the induction of tnfalpha in pma-differentiated u <dig> cells can be attributed to the effect of the artificial differentiation system. the myd88-independent pathway is responsible for sustenance of the proinflammatory program with delayed kinetics of nfkb activation, in the meantime the myd88-dependent pathway triggers response to initial challenge  <cit> . it is likely that the biphasic behavior of tnfalpha production  observed with macrophage-like cells  reflects cross talks and temporal segregation between these two pathways. up regulation of rb together with p <dig> upon pma differentiation is in line with proliferation arrest prior to differentiation process of cells. both jak <dig> and stat <dig>  are known to play a vital role in monocytic differentiation  <cit> . jak <dig>  mediates stat signaling through direct tyrosine phosphorylation of stat proteins followed by stat dimerization. down regulation of mpo, an effector gene of neutrophil function is certainly indicative of macrophage specific gene repression. the presence of nur <dig> in the category of lps inducible genes  is directly corresponding to previous reports in which the role of nr4a orphan receptors  was described as key regulators of chronic inflammatory diseases thus in the innate immune response  <cit> . taken together, u <dig> cells serve a good model system with propensity of differentiation and activation pathways intrinsic to primary monocytes and macrophages.

transcriptional regulators involved in macrophages differentiation and activation
gene expression analysis of transcriptional regulators in both u <dig> cells and primary macrophages revealed several potentially novel factors. mef <dig> family comprises  <dig> members  that are encoded by different genes. they are described as key regulators in muscle cells and related cell types as in the case of cardiac development  <cit> . beside from t cell selection and function  <cit> , they are fairly unknown in the context of the immune system. previously, mef2c was proved to be activated by p38- mediated phosphorylation to induce transcription of jun which in turn regulates cytokine gene expression during inflammatory response  <cit> . more recently, it has been suggested that the mef <dig> family is a versatile regulator in diverse cellular systems  <cit> . however, no significant enrichment of mef <dig> binding site was seen by promoter analysis of differentially expressed genes . possibly, not all mef <dig> binding sites are yet known to be available for complete analysis, thus prevent the final conclusion. on the other hand, mef <dig> might act also through differential protein modification and indirect binding to modulate gene expression. specificity of mef <dig> and co-regulator complexes is likely to confer differentiation and immune regulatory function in macrophages. interestingly, hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  histone deacetylases, known to form repression complexes with mef <dig> family members in many cellular systems are concomitantly up regulated. both histone deacetylases belong to class ii histone deacetylase known to be involved in phosphorylation dependent nucleo â cytoplasmic trafficking in response to activation signals and the formation of repression complexes  <cit> . during muscle development, expression of mef <dig> and hdac <dig> was shown to be increased during initial phase but diminished expression of hdac <dig> at late stage  <cit> . a likewise operation during macrophage activation mechanism by which mef <dig> up regulates its own repressor hdac <dig> can be suggested. among other factors up regulated in both u <dig> cells and primary macrophages are hlx <dig> and bri. hlx <dig> was described as a marker of immature hematopoietic cells and also known to be involved in the activation of t lymphocyte or nk cells  <cit> . bri was identified as a lps-inducible gene in murine macrophages in the presence of csf- <dig>  <cit> . however, there has been no report correlating expression and function of hlx <dig> and bri in macrophages. microarray demonstrated their constant up regulation across different time points of pma differentiation . additionally, rt-pcr result shows constant up regulation of bri across lps stimulation period in u <dig> cells . taken together, it can be strongly suggested they play a role as effecter molecules of transcriptional reprogramming in macrophages.

inconsistent expression pattern and heterogeneity of transcription factors
there are several factors manifesting inconsistent expression patterns between u <dig> and primary cell systems. tcf7l <dig> is one of them. on the contrary to pma/u <dig> cells with which tcf7l <dig> induction of both mrna and protein were verified , m-csf/macrophages show no induction of tcf7l <dig> mrna. keeping in mind that it is known as the hottest susceptibility gene for type  <dig> diabetes while being involved in glucose homeostasis, individual heterogeneity of tcf7l <dig> expression observed with m-csf/macrophages in this study might be informative. during the past decade, many evidences pointed out type  <dig> diabetes as a disease of innate immune system, particularly of macrophages, thus closely link the metabolic syndrome to inflammatory pathway  <cit> . such an inter-relationship promises high probability of tcf7l <dig> acting in macrophage biology. another particularly interesting example of inconsistency is up regulation of klf <dig> observed with pma/u <dig> cells on the contrary to m-csf/macrophages that shows down regulation. klf <dig> was previously reported to be down regulated upon monocyte differentiation or activation in thp- <dig> cells, and has been proved to be a negative regulator of proinflammatory activation of monocytes  <cit> . the basis for this difference between u <dig> and thp- <dig> cells may be due to the different origin and maturation stage of cells. u <dig> cells are of tissue origin  thus at more mature stage. thp <dig> cells are of blood leukemic origin at less mature stage. importantly, up regulation rather than down regulation of klf <dig> did not produce the consequences of abrogating inflammatory gene activation in u <dig> cells. based on the observation of kumar and colleagues in which p <dig> and hdacs repress mef <dig> transcriptional activation of klf <dig> promoter in endothelial cells, it might be reasonable to assume that altered activity balance of antagonistic factors contribute to different cellular activation  <cit> . the roles of klf <dig> and irf <dig> in the differentiation or function of macrophages have been also described previously  <cit> , thus down regulation rather than up regulation with primary macrophages doesn't seem to be immediately accountable. one possible explanation is that an initial amount of protein available in different cell type determine up or down regulation to adjust correct cellular dose. another explanation is that up regulation can be the effect of u <dig> cells that are not equal to primary monocytes in the first place. taken together, the result emphasizes a necessary caution to be exercised when interpreting data obtained from a transformed cell line, alluding differential transcriptional regulatory and signaling pathways between two systems. nevertheless, the heterogeneity of human individuals observed with several factors  including id <dig>  irf <dig>  irf <dig>  tcf7l <dig>  hdac7/ <dig>  oct <dig>  pcaf and mef2b raises a possibility that functional capacities of individual macrophages might determine differential susceptibility to and severity of various immune diseases. this enforce the strong argument that investigations using primary cells from different blood donors can greatly impede reliable conclusion of result, thus further emphasize the necessity of a unified model system.

potential role of chromatin architecture in macrophage activation
being surmised that increased expression of genes upon differentiation may be already indicative of their serving important roles in macrophage function afterward, prompt induction of additional  <dig> genes within  <dig> hrs of lps stimulation is intriguing . it might have an implication that promoters of these genes acquired poised status ready to be quickly remodeled upon lps signal. accordingly, increased expression of variant histone h2av, which is also known as h2az- <dig>  suggests an exciting possibility. as a dynamic regulator relying on its deposit and loss, incorporation of h2av in exchange with h2a  could serve as a stable epigenetic mark to keep quiescent promoters in a repressed state while creating more permissive chromatin architecture until appropriate activation signal is received  <cit> . both forms of protein, h2az- <dig>  and h2az- <dig> , may play new or complementary functions  <cit> . there are probably several types of chromatin remodeling in general. there may be a large scale remodeling early in development and then more regional remodeling as sections of chromatin become active or are shut down. a more localized type of remodeling takes previously prepared regions and opens them up completely upon receipt of more immediate signals for active transcription. each type may shares some protein factors and also has unique factor involvement. it is tempting to speculate that identified transcription factors are operating to repress and induce target genes by directing decondensed chromatin structure  during macrophage development which proceed rapid nucleosome remodeling  upon lps stimulation  <cit> . one possible speculation is whether it functions to activate or silence depend upon the nature of the factors recruited to h2az containing nucleosomes while turning off a set of genes and turning on a new subset during the differentiation and inflammatory process.

CONCLUSIONS
identification of novel transcriptional regulators
the focus of this study was the identification of transcriptional regulators during macrophage differentiation and activation using u <dig> cells as a model system. several novel transcription factors  were found to be up regulated in addition to those already known  to be involved during macrophage differentiation and/or inflammatory response. we report for the first time both mrna and protein induction of mef <dig> proteins, a mads-box transcription factor family, during macrophage differentiation and activation in u <dig> model system. in both u <dig> cells and primary macrophage cells, three different isoforms of mef <dig>  appear to be concomitantly induced, thus suggesting functional redundancy of different members. additionally, mef <dig> is directly linking gene activation with epigenetic gene regulation such as histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the fact that interaction partners known to modulate histone modification  and chromatin structure  are concomitantly expressed.

validity of u <dig> cells as a model system
u <dig> cells used in this study are proved to be very close to functional monocytes as indicated by the low number of differently expressed genes upon vitd <dig> differentiation, thus can be an ideal model system to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms in differentiating macrophages. array analysis of pma differentiated and lps activated cells revealed a variety of genes intrinsic to macrophages, inflammation and innate immunity. nevertheless, how faithfully do these cells resemble primary macrophages is a question to be challenged with carefulness because differentiation pathways in u <dig> cells-derived macrophages and primary macrophages may diverges to some degree considering the malignant origin of u <dig> cells. this was asserted by cross validation of  <dig> transcriptional regulators, which proved a  <dig> %  of tested factors with consistent expression pattern between pma differentiated u <dig> cells and m-csf differentiated monocytes. the observed differences are based on different macrophage maturation thus highlight the necessity of cross validation. individual heterogeneity of blood donors further emphasizes the advantage of using a unified model system. taken together, target genes under investigation should be selected carefully keeping in mind that cells are characterized by how they respond to various stimuli as defined by gene expression. this allows pma differentiated u <dig> cells to act as representative of macrophages.

future perspectives
as a next step, the role of new identified genes should be verified through functional studies such as rnai knock down. a further task would be to elucidate how newly identified transcription regulators communicate with factors that modify and remodel chromatin structure of target gene promoters.
