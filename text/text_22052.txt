BACKGROUND
the development of efficient routes to fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is an area of significant research interest. terrestrial lignocellulosic materials are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. cellulose, a crystalline homopolymer of glucose accounts for 40–50% of plant biomass, and as such is a potentially enormous source of glucose for microbial fermentation to valuable products  <cit> . hemicelluloses, on the other hand, are heterogeneous polymers of various pentose and hexose sugars, accounting for 25–35% of biomass, and these sugars are a significant potential source of carbon and energy for biorefinery processes  <cit> . currently the process to access these sugars requires a harsh chemical pre-treatment of plant biomass followed by digestion using a cocktail of secreted fungal enzymes to liberate sugars for fermentation. despite the large amount of available plant material on a renewable and sustainable basis, the economical production of fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass is currently hindered by several factors. these include the energy intensive pretreatment step, high production costs of biomass, and low catalytic efficiency of hydrolytic enzymes used for depolymerisation of cellulose. identifying and/or engineering glycoside hydrolases  with improved enzymatic properties is a necessary step in reducing these costs  <cit> .

it has been a long held desire to design efficient biocatalytic processes via amenable microbial activities. environmental genomics, also known as metagenomics, has great potential for the discovery of new enzymes and pathways for biomass conversion  <cit> . microorganisms from natural environments are a rich source of new biocatalysts and potentially conceal a massive trove of unknown encoded biocatalysts. the attempt to access these biocatalysts has been hindered by the ability to culture microbes in the laboratory. however, recent advances in dna sequencing technology has made it possible to interrogate the sequence space of an organism or community to recover large numbers of putative coding regions in a high throughput manner without the need for laboratory culturing and propagation  <cit> . this approach allows for the detection of functional genes encoding biocatalysts of interest and has recently been successfully used for gh gene discovery using samples from the cow rumen microbial community  <cit>  and in the microbial community associated with earthworm casts  <cit> .

functional metagenomics is typically performed through the analysis of orfs using a functional assay and is currently the major bottleneck for biocatalyst discovery and validation. careful consideration of the environment not only allows for discovery of appropriate biocatalysts but also increases the chances of identifying novel biocatalysts with unique structural and kinetic properties. to that end we interrogated a switchgrass-adapted compost microbial community  <cit>  to identify genes predicted to encode enzymes with diverse activities on hemicelluloses, including endoxylanase, α-arabinofuranosidase, β-xylosidase, α-fucosidase, and acetyl xylan esterase. we then expressed these genes in e. coli, followed by purification and biochemical characterization of four of the resulting enzymes, focusing on properties important for the process of biomass hydrolysis. these enzymes may serve as useful scaffolds for protein engineering towards the goal of developing a suite of enzymes suitable for efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. this study validates the approach of targeted metagenomics for identifying potentially useful biocatalysts for specific process environments.

RESULTS
cloning  <dig> putative cazy-like genes from the compost metagenome
sequence analysis of the respective compost metagenomic data identified  <dig> putative full-length hemicellulase sequences spanning various families in cazy    <cit> . the  <dig> genes were codon-optimized for recombinant expression in e. coli and synthesized commercially . each of the genes was pcr-amplified and cloned into pdonr <dig> to produce a gateway entry clone. three expression clones for each gene were generated from the entry clones using pet57-dest, pet60-dest, and pvp <dig> as destination vectors. the total set of expression clones incorporated a variety of promoters, solubility tags, and affinity tags. 

expression screening
the expression clones were transformed into appropriate expression host cell lines  for the pet-derived clones). transformants were selected and grown for protein expression in 96-deep-well plates in auto-induction medium  <cit> . cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed using lysozyme and triton x- <dig>  and clarified by centrifugation. soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed on a caliper gxii microfluidics platform with lims integration for automated qc of protein expression and solubility . we were able to achieve expression of all of the genes in each of the three expression vectors, as judged by analysis of the cell lysates. western blot analysis with anti-his tag antibodies detected varying levels of soluble protein expression for every orf in each of the three vectors . significant soluble expression was achieved for  <dig> of  <dig> genes in pet <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> in pet <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig> in pvp <dig>  

activity screening
the entire set of soluble lysates was tested for endoxylanase, β-xylosidase, and α-arabinofuranosidase activities via colorimetric assays . specific lysates were also tested for α-glucuronidase, cellulase, α-fucosidase, β-glucosidase, and acetyl esterase activities. in total, we were able to confirm seven of the predicted activities from twenty-two orfs assayed. four of the enzymes with confirmed activities were purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail.

twenty-two orfs from  <dig> cazy families were screened for expression and activity. all of the orfs could be expressed in soluble form in e. coli and seven of twenty-two orfs demonstrated the predicted activity.

purification and characterization of jmc25406
jmc <dig>  predicted to be a bi-functional β-xylosidase/α-arabinofuranosidase, was purified  by affinity chromatography making use of the encoded fusion with his and gst tags. the gst tag was readily cleaved by tev protease and a final polishing step was performed on q anion exchange resin. the purified protein had a specific activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/mg using 4-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/mg using 4-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside at ph  <dig> . these values are comparable to values from previous literature reports for enzymes from this family  <cit> . interestingly jmc <dig> showed a broad ph optimum for both activities ranging between ph  <dig> - <dig>  . the enzyme was stable to heating up to 60°c for  <dig> min, but lost activity rapidly above that temperature . we then performed additional experiments that showed that jmc <dig> maintained ~75% of its activity after  <dig> hours at 60°c . these data agree well with the results of differential scanning fluorimetry , which estimated the tm of the protein to be  <dig> °c . 

purification and characterization of jmc <dig> and jmc37744
jmc <dig> and jmc <dig>  predicted to be endoxylanases, were purified  using affinity chromatography making use of the fusion with his and mbp tags. tev cleavage of jmc <dig> was efficient, but once cleaved the free protein was prone to aggregation, while the mbp-jmc <dig> fusion protein was a poor substrate for tev protease, possibly due to inaccessibility of the cleavage recognition site in the folded fusion protein. both proteins were characterized as fusion proteins with appropriate negative controls. both enzymes showed endoxylanase activity on wheat arabinoxylan, with specific activities of  <dig>   and  <dig>   u/mg, and had ph optima around 6– <dig> . these properties were similar to those of commercially available enzymes. interestingly, jmc <dig> showed greater activity than jmc <dig> at higher ph, maintaining >50% of maximal activity at ph  <dig>  both enzymes were moderately thermostable, with jmc <dig> maintaining ~75% of its maximal activity up to 60°c, and jmc <dig> maintaining ~40% of maximal activity up to 70°c .

purification and characterization of jmc09349
jmc <dig>  predicted to be an α-fucosidase, was purified  using affinity chromatography making use of the encoded fusion with his and mbp tags and a q anion-exchange chromatography step. mbp tag cleavage by tev protease was not very efficient and the intact fusion protein was used for further characterization with appropriate negative controls. the purified fusion protein was active on the model substrate 4-nitrophenyl pyranofucoside, with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg. the ph optimum is  <dig> , and the enzyme maintains >50% of maximal activity between ph 3– <dig>  . the enzyme was stable up to 50°c for  <dig> min, but lost activity above that temperature , which agrees well with the dsf results, which estimated the tm of the protein to be  <dig> °c .

discussion
metagenomic analysis is an extremely powerful approach for investigating the microbial ecology of diverse environments, and a useful tool for accessing genetic diversity for applications in biotechnology  <cit> . this genetic diversity can serve as an important source for new biocatalysts with desired characteristics  <cit> , as well as providing targets for structure-function analysis expanding our understanding of protein structural space  <cit> . environments where biomass turnover rates are high at elevated temperatures, such as compost, are potentially an important source of targeted novel biocatalysts for lignocellulose degradation, one of the major barriers to economically viable biofuel production.

our work in cloning, expressing, and assaying  <dig> putative cazy enzymes has validated the targeted metagenomic approach for gh discovery by identifying  <dig> active hits from  <dig> screened orfs. we used a high-throughput cloning approach using the gateway system and liquid-handling robots for cloning the  <dig> orfs into multiple expression vectors, expression screening, and activity screening. this approach has allowed us to rapidly identify vector and host combinations that result in well-behaved expression of orfs.

four of the expressed enzymes were purified and characterized in detail. jmc <dig>  predicted to be a gh <dig> family bifunctional β-xylosidase/α-arabinofuranosidase, showed robust activity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/mg protein on model substrates  for both activities, comparable to literature values as well as commercially available standards. compared to a previously described gh <dig> enzyme isolated from compost  <cit> , jmc <dig> exhibited similar ph profile , but surprisingly increased thermal stability . due to its dual functions, high thermal stability, and ease of purification, jmc <dig> is an excellent starting point for further protein engineering for enzymatic cocktail development for various potential pretreatment strategies. jmc <dig>  a gh <dig> family protein, and jmc <dig>  a gh <dig> family protein, were demonstrated to possess the predicted endoxylanase activity. both enzymes had similar properties; ph optima around  <dig>  and stability to 60–70°c. jmc <dig> displays activity over a very broad ph range . jmc <dig> was demonstrated to possess the predicted α-fucosidase activity, and has a broad ph optimum around 3– <dig>  and modest thermostability up to 50°c. taken together, the characterized enzymes ph optima and thermal stability profiles are quite consistent with the culture conditions of the compost community  <cit> , further highlighting the importance of altering culture conditions in metagenomics experiments to enrich for enzymes with desired properties. these data indicate that it may be possible to isolate enzymes with robust activity in specific operating conditions  by tailoring matching cultivation conditions and a recent publication on a similar compost community grown under thermophilic conditions found that culture supernatants were enriched for thermotolerant cellulose and hemicellulase activities  <cit> .

although metagenomic analysis is a powerful tool for enzyme discovery, the limiting factor for success using this approach remains time-consuming soluble protein expression and purification and biochemical characterization. the development of generalized methods for enzyme purification and assay with increased throughput will be necessary to fully harness the immense genetic diversity present in natural environments.

CONCLUSIONS
twenty-two putative cazy orfs were cloned into expression vectors and screened for soluble expression and activity using various glycoside hydrolase assays. six orfs were demonstrated to have the predicted activity when expressed in e. coli. four of these active enzymes showing diverse hemicellulase activities were purified to near homogeneity, characterized biochemically, and shown to have broad ph optima and moderate thermostability.
