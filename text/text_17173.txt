BACKGROUND
swainsonine, one of the indolizidine alkaloid isolated from locoweeds   <cit> , is the main toxin-resulting in animal locoism which clinical syndrome showed dispirited behavior, insensitivity, abortion, fertility problems, amniotic membrane swelling and even serious vacuolar degeneration of the nerves and the internal organs  <cit> . swainsonine, whose structure is similar to mannose but has higher affinity with mannosidase than mannose, is a well-known inhibitor of lysosomal α-mannosidase and golgi mannosidase ii. different cells, especially neurons and corpus luteum showed vacuolation, because swainsonine disturb mannose metabolism and the production of a mixture of mannose and asparagine polysaccharide  <cit> . swainsonine can inhibit essential enzymes in glycoprotein metabolism, resulting in long-term integration of hybrid sugars which disrupt the cellular metabolism, and can also cause disorders of hormone and enzyme synthesis and receptor binding  <cit> . ingestion of swainsonine-containing plants can decrease serum progesterone concentration which is essential to early embryo development, implantation and maintenance of pregnancy . vacuolation of corpus luteum cells could be observed in pregnant and just aborted animals after long time ingestion of swainsonine-containing plants  <cit> , but it is not clearly if vacuolation is the major cause of the abortions observed following locoweed ingestion, or the disorder of reproductive hormone  <cit> .

t-helper  cells, as a part of pregnancy immunology, play an important role in modulating immune responses to ensure a successful pregnancy and fetus development . fetus is a source of alloantigens to maternal immunity during pregnancy, avoiding th1-type immunity attack  <cit> . however, a lot of recurrent spontaneous abortion and preeclampsia may happen if predominant th1-type immunity occur . the decrease of th <dig> and increase of th <dig> are necessary to protect the fetus without compromising the mother, as th <dig> produces an array of inflammatory cytokines  and th <dig> produces anti-inflammatory cytokines  and il- <dig>  <cit> .

swainsonine as an immunomodulator agent, can enhance phagocytosis activity and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages and lead to elevated secretion of certain glycoproteins and inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, and also have efficient function to induce progenitor cell proliferation, release into the circulation in rodents and have been considered to boost immune cell function in cancer patients . these suggest that swainsonine may disrupt the pregnancy immunology by promoting autoimmunity or increasing th <dig> immunity and suppressing th <dig> immunity and even leading to abortion. to explore this possibility, pregnant mice were exposed to swainsonine orally, then the key cytokines of pregnancy immunology in serum and their gene expression were examined.

RESULTS
pregnancy status
all mice in the experiment were pregnant initially and had a normal state of appetite, drinking and faeces. we did euthanasia and separated the uterus and ovary for more analysis. the body weight of the mice treat with  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> dropped more than 15 % suddenly in 16th ~ 18th day of the pregnancy, and the aborted fetuses were found in the cages. we considered the mice were abortion, and did not do any other analysis on them.

effects of different concentrations of swainsonine on lutein cell
in experiments to assess whether it is feasible to expose the experimental animals to swainsonine by orally route or not, histopathology of corpus luteum were analyzed. microscopically, corpus luteum tissue exposed to different concentrations of swainsonine showed different degrees of degenerative changes when compared to the control group. on an average, degenerative changes noted with the treatment with swainsonine were almost the same but differed in intensity of lesions and cellular degeneration and death. however, vacuolation of the luteum cell  was seen at the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> and higher regularly or at the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> occasionally. high dose groups  showed serious cellular vacuolation .fig.  <dig> histopathological slide of the corpus luteum. from the histopathological studies, vacuolation were observed after swainsonine treatment  but not for control group , as indicated by the arrows. the dose of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> induced relatively vacuolation , but the group that received the dose of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> showed serious cellular damage evidenced by vacuolation



th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine concentration between five groups at baseline
to further examine the effect of different concentration of swainsonine in the inhibition of cytokine production, we examined the expression of cytokine in the peripheral blood by elisa. the distribution of various cytokines among cases and control has been summarized in fig.  <dig>  proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α and il-1β, and the th <dig> signature cytokine ifn-γ were significantly increased  in mice exposed to mice exposed to swainsonine, compared with control group in a dose-related manner . il-1β and tnf-α was significantly increased  in peripheral blood leukocytes when swainsonine exposed at the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> or higher dose . moreover, for ifn-γ, a significant  increasing was observed with the treatment of a dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  and significantly  decreasing il- <dig> and il- <dig> were lower in experiment groups than in control . only in the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  or higher dose  for il- <dig> and in the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  or higher dose  for il- <dig> showed inhibitory effect. the results suggested that swainsonine administered orally for  <dig> d promoted th <dig> cytokines and inhibited th <dig> cytokines in serum of pregnant mice.fig.  <dig> th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines concentration among the four groups and control  at baseline. proinflammatory cytokines like tnf-α and il-1β, and th <dig> cytokine ifn-γ were significantly increased  in cases of mice exposed to swainsonine, compared with the control group in a dose-related manner. a, d, e il-1β and tnf-αincreased very significantly  in peripheral blood leukocytes when exposed to swainsonine at the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> or higher dose . but for ifn-γ, a significant  increase was observed with the treatment at a dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  il- <dig>  as the th <dig> cytokines and il- <dig> were lower in experimental groups than in control group , also in a dose-related manner. only the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> for il- <dig> and the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d- <dig>  or higher dose  for il- <dig> showed inhibitory effect



swainsonine stimulates il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf-α and suppresses il- <dig>  il-10
to investigate the effects of swainsonine on il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the expression level of mrna was measured. the transcriptional responses of several cytokine’ genes are shown in fig.  <dig>  the expression of il-1β, ifn-γ and tnf-α gene was significantly up-regulated  after swainsonine exposure comparable control group, but the expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> was significantly down-regulated .fig.  <dig> the expression of genes related to the th1/th <dig> cytokines. the relative expression level was measured by qrt-pcr. β-actin was used as an internal control. each reaction was repeated three times. and the data was expressed as the mean ± sd, relative to the control. *means p <  <dig>  and **means p <  <dig>  as the indication of the different groups exposed to swainsonine compared with the control group. n =  <dig> for each replicate; three replicates were conducted



swainsonine promotes activity of th <dig> cells and suppresses th2
imbalance among the th <dig> and th <dig> cell immune responses plays an important role in unexplained habitual abortion   <cit> . we investigated the th1/th <dig> subpopulations after t helper cell activation. the data showed that compared to control group, the proportion of th <dig>  cell increased, while the proportions of th <dig>  cell decreased markedly at the experiment groups , resulting in the increased ratios of th1/th <dig> cells, which is not benefic to pregnancy.fig.  <dig> flow cytometry of th1/th <dig> cytokines between four groups and control group  at baseline. as showed in the fig. 3a and b, the th1/th <dig> balance of pregnant mice was imbalanced, respectively. a were the intracellular cytokine expression of th <dig> and th <dig>  the x-axis were the expression of il- <dig> and the y-axis were the expression of ifn-γ. b were the th1/th <dig> of each group. different dose of swainsonine can significantly effect th1/th <dig> balance. in the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> or higher dose, th <dig> cell were promoted and th <dig> were inhibited, especially in the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  swainsonine-treaded mice showed th <dig> dominant that is detrimental to pregnancy



discussion
in the past decades, swainsonine was a focus of research of the main toxic ingredient in locoweed and in the development of antineoplastic drugs. they showed that swainsonine can lead to animal’s miscarriage and stillbirth, probably involving corpus luteum and hormone excretion, and possibly a direct action to the fetus; nevertheless, there are no reports about immunotoxicity for reproduction  <cit> . we demonstrate that dietary treatment of pregnant mice with different concentration of swainsonine for 13 days results in significant alterations in a number of parameters associated with the immunity of reproduction. we observed that different dose treatments lead to different levels of promotion of th <dig> immune and inhibition of th <dig> immune, as immunoenhancement was previously established using this regimen. since it is well established that this regimen of exposure induces a measure of immunoenhancement . we expected these studies would provide experimental data that could subsequently be used for related locoism analyses.

previous studies have provided sufficient evidence that swainsonine can perform its cellular immune function by increasing organ index and the cell proliferation rate. the dose in our research was determined as 0 ~  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> in accordance with previous studies and preliminary experiments that showed an immunoregulation effect but no abortion. the highest dose group of  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> was not done due to the occurrence of abortion or eutocia, despite a significant regulation of th1/th <dig> and other relevant cytokines  <cit> . so the dose was determined to avoid abortion in the experiment. an easy way to determine whether a pregnant mouse has an abortion is by checking weight, because they normally increased 30 % during pregnancy.

in our research we found that il- <dig> increased significantly in dose of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> of swainsonine, but no difference were found in dose of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig>  these findings are consistent with those of hueza et al.  <cit> , who reported that low dosages of ipomoea carnea, a kind of swainsonine-containing plants, induced enhanced phagocytosis activity and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages, as il- <dig> is intensely produced by macrophages. on the other hand, zhang et al. found that following exposure of adult km mice to the dose of  <dig> - <dig>  mg•kg− <dig> by gavage over a period of 24 days, organ index and cellular counts in blood were increased and the proliferative activity of spleen lymphocytes were stimulated by swainsonine alone or combined with cona and pha-p, but cellular immune function would be depressed at the dose of  <dig>  mg•kg− <dig>  <cit> . in addition, there are differences in sensitivity by species to swainsonine accumulation. tnf-α is one of the proinflammatory cytokines and can be classified as th1-type cytokines in reproductive immunology. tnf-α and ifn-γ are the major effectors of phagocyte-mediated host defense, protective against intracellular pathogens. they induce miscarriage in mice, which can be reversed by inhibitors of the th <dig> cytokines or by administering the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> and th <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  previous studies have shown that tnf-α and il-1β, proinflammatory cytokines ultimately result in the production of prostaglandins and mmps, via nf-κb. this triggers a cascade of prolabour events including uterine contractility and fetal membrane rupture, and if this cascade is activated early in pregnancy, preterm labour can ensue. moreover, term placentas exhibit comparatively higher levels of the il- <dig> and th <dig> cytokines, il- <dig>  compared with the preterm placentas.

at the same time, it is possible that swainsonine stimulates the th <dig> arm of the cellular immune response and suppresses the th <dig> arm of the humoral immune response  <cit> . dennis, who disclosed a stable crystalline chloride or bromide salt of swainsonine and applied for a patent, insists that swainsonine have valuable pharmacological and immunomodulatory properties. indeed, we consider that swainsonine is associated with a profound imbalance in th1/th2-type cytokines with excess type  <dig> and deficient type  <dig> responses. this imbalance was manifest in both inducing  and effector  cytokines. ifn-γ and il- <dig> are the most substantiated example of a pair of mutually counter-regulatory cytokines and represent the archetypal cytokines of the th1/th2-type paradigm. il- <dig> is a product of various cell types including t-cells and monocytes and possesses a wide range of activities including suppression of th1-type cytokine secretion. the significantly decreased quantity of il-4+ to ifn-γ+ secreting cells ratio also demonstrates the development of an excessive type  <dig> and deficient type  <dig> immune response in the pregnant mice with the high dose exposure of swainsonine.

th <dig> cells, which produce proinflammatory cytokines , are involved in acute allograft rejection of transplanted tissues, and as the main immunotoxicity factor to fetus  <cit> . th <dig> cells, which produce cytokines, such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  are associated with allograft tolerance,and protected fetus from maternal th1-cell attack  <cit> . during pregnancy, the balance of the th1/th <dig> paradigm skews to th <dig> to protect the fetus from maternal th1-cell attack  <cit> . indeed, a predominant th1-type immune response has been observed in pregnancy complications, such as recurrent spontaneous abortion  and eclampsia  <cit> . therefore, adequate balance for th1/th <dig> immunity, slightly shifted to th2-type immunity, may be suitable for the maintenance of pregnancy. predominant th1-type immunity may suppress the tolerance system by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokine or stimulating nk cell, neutrophilic cell , resulting in abortion  <cit> .

the mechanism via which exposure of mice to swainsonine enhances th <dig> cell activity and inhibit th <dig> cell activity remains to be elucidated. however, one possibility is that this phenomenon may be a result of inhibition of golgi α-mannosidase. blocking the pathway at golgi α-mannosidase ii causes an accumulation of “hybrid-type” carbohydrate structures, which have terminal mannose residues. the exposed mannose residues are important features directly related to immune stimulation  <cit> . at the molecular level, it has been shown that certain cytokines, including ifn-γ, il- <dig> and tnf-α, bind to carbohydrate structures terminating in mannose structures such as those which accumulate when golgi mannosidase ii is blocked  <cit> . as a result, blocking the pathway will indirectly affect the th1/th <dig> balance.

swainsonine has valuable pharmacological properties and they provide antimicrobial, cancer suppressing effects, hemorestorative, chemoprotective, radioprotective, and immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . it is confirmed that swainsonine-containing plant is effective against ptroteus vulgaris, salmonella typhimurium bacteria and aspergillus niger, penicillium digitatum, botrytis cinerea, rhizopus arrhizus, aspergillus flavus, chaetomium brasiliense and rhizoctonia solani  <cit> . swainsonine induced macrophage tumoricidal activity and acted as an important immune effector involved in the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in vital organs such as the lung, oesophagus  <cit> , liver and spleen  <cit> . we found that the intake of swainsonine or some swainsonine-containing plants as traditional medicine may pose a threat to the pregnancy. therefore, the application of swainsonine as either drug or supplementary food should be reconsidered.

one standard procedure for assessing the reproduction immunological status is to determine the th1/th <dig> immunization  <cit> . we observed significant changes in this parameter in the pregnant balb/c mice with the regimen of exposure. however, recent developments in studies of the implantation process and in the emergence of the uterine vascular bed and its control by natural killer cells and cytokines suggest that one must go beyond this hitherto useful scheme  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings demonstrate for the first time that at least certain swainsonine can exert adverse effect on the reproduction immunity, an important factor of pregnancy for all animals. together, these findings provide strong support on our conclusion that at the dose of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mg•kg−1•d− <dig> swainsonine in the diet over a period of 13 days effect the th1/th <dig> paradigm of pregnant female balb/c mice and is harmful to pregnancy. determination of th1/th <dig> ratio, cytokine expression and mrna level of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α genes in pregnant mice exposed by swainsonine and reproduction immunology. the study may provide new aspects of that reproductive immunology that could be effected by swainsonine and its negative effect to animals in the pregnant period.
