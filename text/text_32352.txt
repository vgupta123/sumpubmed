BACKGROUND
with a world production of  <dig> million bags of beans in  <dig> http://www.ico.org, coffee is the most important agricultural commodity worldwide and a source of income for many developing tropical countries  <cit> . in the genus coffea, two species are responsible for almost all coffee bean production: coffea canephora and coffea arabica, which contribute approximately  <dig> and 70% of worldwide production, respectively  <cit> . c. canephora is a diploid  and allogamous coffea species. on the other hand, c. arabica is an amphidiploid , which comes from a natural hybridisation estimated to have taken place more than  <dig>  years ago between the ancestors of present-day c. canephora and c. eugenioides  <cit> . in this context, the transcriptome of c. arabica is a mixture of homeologous genes expressed from these two sub-genomes  <cit> . aside from the pure "arabica" varieties, c. arabica cultivars recently introgressed with c. canephora genome have been selected in order to take advantage of available c. canephora's disease-resistant genes. natural and recent interspecific  timor hybrids as well as controlled interspecific crosses provided the progenitors for these introgressed c. arabica varieties  <cit> .

coffee production is subjected to regular oscillations explained mainly by the natural biennial cycle but also by the adverse effects of climatic conditions. among them, drought and high temperature are key factors affecting coffee plant development and production  <cit> . if severe drought periods can lead to plant death, moderate drought periods are also very damaging to coffee growers by affecting flowering, bean development and, consequently, coffee production. in addition, large variations in rainfall and temperature also increase bean defects, modify bean biochemical composition and the final quality of the beverage  <cit> . as a result of global climate change, periods of drought may become more pronounced, and the sustainability of total production, productivity and coffee quality may become more difficult to maintain  <cit> .

the primary effects of water stress  on physiological and biochemical processes in plants have been extensively discussed  <cit> . they are attributable to various processes, including diffusional , photochemical  and/or biochemical processes . stomatal closure is one of the earliest responses to short-term soil drying, therefore limiting water loss and net carbon assimilation  by photosynthesis. the decrease of photosynthesis under ws can come from co <dig> limitation mediated by stomatal closure or by a direct effect on the photosynthetic capacity of chloroplasts. independently of the nature of this reduction, the intensity of the intercepted irradiance can greatly exceed the irradiance necessary to saturate photosynthesis. as co <dig> assimilation precedes inactivation of electron transfer reactions, an excess of reducing power is frequently generated in water-stressed plants  <cit> . thus, this excess can be used to reduce the molecular oxygen leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species  and causing photooxidative damage  <cit> . under prolonged drought stress, reduced growth, reduced leaf area and altered assimilate partitioning among tree organs seems to be responsible for decreased crop yield  <cit> . in c <dig> plants, the key photosynthetic enzyme is the rubisco , which is responsible for co <dig> fixation and photorespiration  <cit> . this enzyme is localised in the chloroplast stroma and accounts for approximately 30-60% of the total soluble protein in plants. rubisco also constitutes a large pool of stored leaf nitrogen that can be quickly remobilised under stress and senescence  <cit> . in higher plants, the rubisco holoenzyme is composed of large  and small  subunits encoded respectively by the unique chloroplastic rbcl gene and the small rbcs multigene family located in the nucleus  <cit> . in fact, potential rubisco activity is determined by the amount of rubisco protein, which in turn is determined by the relative rate of biosynthesis and degradation. these processes are regulated by gene expression, mrna stability, polypeptide synthesis, post-translational modification, assembly of subunits into an active holoenzyme, and various factors that impact upon protein degradation  <cit> .

numerous studies have shown that rbcs transcripts accumulate differentially in response to light intensity or tissue development . this raises the possibility that rbcs subunits may regulate the structure or function of rubisco  <cit> . at the molecular level, drought stress suppresses the expression of many photosynthetic genes including the rbcs genes  <cit> . in contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes of the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathway  were induced during drought, suggesting that these pathways are used for the production of reducing power in the absence of photosynthesis during stress  <cit> . even if rubisco inactivation contributes to the non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis under drought stress  <cit> , data demonstrated a rubisco reduction in stressed plants  <cit> . this is in agreement with the observation that part of the biochemical limitation of the photosynthetic rate  during drought comes from rubisco regeneration rather than from a decrease in rubisco activity  <cit> . in that sense, the ws-induced decrease in rubisco content may characterise a general stimulation of senescence and/or the specific degradation of this protein by oxidative processes  <cit> . however, other work has reported that the amount of rubisco protein is poorly affected by moderate and even prolonged severe drought  <cit> . the mechanism by which rubisco may be down-regulated due to tight binding inhibitors could be pivotal for the tolerance and recovery from stress  <cit> . rubisco binding proteins that are able to stabilise rubisco could also be related to drought tolerance  <cit> , but their roles in the structure, function and regulation of rbcs subunits are poorly understood  <cit> .

during the last decade, coffee breeding programs identified clones of c. canephora var. conilon that presented differential responses to ws  <cit> . physiological characteristics of these clones revealed differences in root depth, stomatal control of water use and long-term water use efficiencies , which were estimated through carbon isotope discrimination . even if some coffee cultivars perform osmotic adjustment under water deficit stress  <cit> , little is known about the mechanisms of drought stress tolerance in coffee trees  <cit> . when studying container-grown c. arabica l. plants for  <dig> days under three soil moisture regimes, meinzer et al.  <cit>  observed that the total leaf area of plants irrigated twice a week was one-half that of plants irrigated twice a day although their assimilation rates on a unit-leaf-area basis were nearly equal throughout the experiment. this suggests that the maintenance of nearly constant photosynthetic characteristics on a unit-leaf-area basis through the maintenance of a smaller total leaf area may constitute a major mode of adjustment to reduced soil moisture availability in coffee. similar results were also reported for field-grown c. canephora  <cit> .

the periodicity of coffee vegetative growth is also heavily dependent on several environmental factors, such as temperature, photoperiod, irradiance and water supply. seasonal changes in vegetative growth and photosynthesis were previously reported for field-grown plants of c. arabica l. cv. catua√≠ vermelho  <cit> . in that case, the reduced growth period during the winter season was characterised by a decline in air temperature leading to a decrease in the net carbon assimilation rate  and leaf starch accumulation. this decrease in photosynthesis during the winter season is not likely to be due to stomatal limitation because gs  remains relatively high at the same time. kanechi et al.  <cit>  showed that low rates of photosynthesis were accompanied by a decreased content of rubisco in coffee leaves exposed to prolonged ws. in another study, kanechi et al.  <cit>  also demonstrated that leaf photosynthesis in coffee plants exposed to rapid dehydration decreased as a consequence of non-stomatal limitation that was associated with the inhibition of rubisco activity.

regarding the importance of photosynthesis in controlling plant development and the lack of information concerning expression of genes coding for rubisco subunits in coffee, here, we decided to first focus on the expression of rbcs <dig> genes encoding the small subunit of rubisco. using the recent advances in coffee genomics  <cit>  and the carbcs <dig> cdna available from c. arabica  <cit> , our study aims to  identify the different coffee rbcs <dig> gene homeologs corresponding to the c. canephora and c. eugenioides ancestor sub-genomes of the amphidiploid c. arabica species,  evaluate the expression of these alleles in different coffee genotypes and species with an emphasis on c. arabica cultivars with and without recent introgression from c. canephora and  study the effects of different  ws on rbcs <dig> expression in juvenile and adult c. canephora and c. arabica plants. finally, rbcs <dig> expression was also studied at different times of the day and discussed in relation to the rbcs <dig> protein profiles observed under ws.

RESULTS
identification of coffee cdna sequences coding for rbcs <dig> 
the use of the carbcs <dig>  cdna from c. arabica as a query sequence identified several similar sequences in the coffee databases, and they were aligned for comparison . the c. arabica unigene sgn-u <dig> preferentially aligned with the carbcs <dig> cdna and gene sequences already reported for this species, and it matched perfectly with the coding sequences of partial rbcs <dig> genes cloned from different genotypes of c. arabica . on the other hand, the c. arabica unigene  was more identical to the c. canephora sgn-u <dig> unigene than other c. arabica sgn-u <dig> unigene. a single and short rbcs <dig> est of c. eugenioides  <cit>  was also aligned with these sequences. notably, it was strictly identical with the carbcs <dig> and sgn-u <dig> sequences from c. arabica but diverged by few bases with the unigenes sgn-u <dig> and sgn-u <dig> of c. canephora.

within the rbcs <dig> protein-coding sequence, five bases differed between sgn-u <dig> and sgn-u <dig>  but only three diverged between the sequences of c. arabica. the main difference between all of these sequences was found in their 3' untranslated  region by the presence of a 12-bp sequence  localised  <dig> bp after the stop codon of the unigenes sgn-u <dig> and sgn-u <dig> of c. canephora, which was not observed in the carbcs <dig> gene and cdna sequences. in addition, the c. arabica unigene sgn-u <dig> was more related to the c. canephora unigene sgn-u <dig> than to the previously-cloned carbcs <dig> cdna.

rbcs <dig> cdnas were sequenced from the rubi  cultivar of c. arabica that did not recently introgress with c. canephora genomic dna and clone  <dig> of c. canephora var. conilon using primer pair  <dig>  which was designed to conserved rbcs <dig> cdna regions of the two species. for the rubi cultivar, the cdna was strictly identical to the rbcs <dig> coding region of the carbcs <dig> gene  and without detection of any single nucleotide polymorphisms . on the other hand, the rbcs <dig> cdna from c. canephora was strictly identical to the unigene sgn-u <dig> . altogether, these results confirmed those retrieved from the est analysis, which demonstrated the existence of two homeologous genes of rbcs <dig> in c. arabica, one from the c. canephora sub-genome and another from the c. eugenioides sub-genome.

cloning of the ccrbcs <dig> gene
the rbcs <dig> gene from c. canephora  was also cloned and sequenced . it shared 90% nucleotide identity with the carbcs <dig> gene from c. arabica that corresponds to the rbcs <dig> gene  of the c. eugenioides sub-genome. the two genes exhibited a similar structure and consisted of three exons and two introns. the sizes of the first and second introns were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for the cace allelic form and  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for the cacc allelic form, which therefore demonstrates inter-specific sequence polymorphisms. the nucleotide sequences differed by numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms  and several insertion and deletion  events in the introns and the 3' utr region. regarding the introns, it is worth noting that those of the rbcs1-cc gene were always slightly longer than those of the rbcs1-ce gene.

the characteristics of the rbcs <dig> proteins
an in silico analysis of these sequences was performed to define the characteristics of the corresponding rbcs <dig> proteins. all of them contained a 543-bp open reading frame coding for a protein of  <dig> amino acids . the rbcs1-ce  protein was deduced from the unigene sgn-u <dig> from c. arabica and was identical to that deduced from the carbcs <dig> cdna and gene sequences. the protein has a theoretical molecular mass of  <dig> da and an estimated isoelectric point  of  <dig>  . by homology with other chloroplastic proteins encoded in the nucleus  <cit> , the first  <dig> amino acids corresponded to a putative chloroplast transit peptide. consequently, the theoretical molecular mass of the mature rbcs1-ce should be  <dig> da with a pi of  <dig> . on the other hand, two isoforms of the rbcs1-cc protein could be deduced from the nucleic sequences of c. canephora: rbcs1a-cc coded by the rbcs1-cc cdna  and rbcs1b-cc deduced from the sgn-u <dig> unigene. in their mature forms, the rbcs1a-cc and rbcs1b-cc proteins should have a molecular mass of  <dig> and  <dig> da and estimated pis of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this analysis suggests that different rbcs <dig> isoforms exist and are characterised by similar molecular weights but differing theoretical pis.

rbcs <dig> gene expression in different genotypes and species of coffea
according to the sequence alignments, primer pairs specific for each of the rbcs <dig> homeologous genes  were designed  and quantitative pcr assays were performed to analyse rbcs <dig> expression in leaves of coffee plants from different species and genotypes by measuring the cacc and cace expression levels . from a technical point of view, cross-hybridisation of primers against the two different rbcs <dig> genes was excluded because the melting curves clearly separated the cacc and cace amplicons produced using the c <dig> and e <dig> specific primer pairs, respectively . using the c <dig> primer pair, high expression of the cacc homeologous gene was observed in leaves of conilon clones of c. canephora. on the other hand, cacc was weakly expressed in leaves of c. arabica genotypes, particularly for those that did not undergo recent introgression with c. canephora genomic dna, such as typica, bourbon, caturra, catua√≠ and rubi, for example. the opposite situation was observed with the primer pair e <dig>  specific for the rbcs1-ce  haplotype from the c. eugenioides sub-genome of c. arabica. for c. eugenioides, the cacc/cace expression was extremely low, which validates that there is almost an exclusive expression of the cace isoform in this species. altogether, these results showed that cace and cacc expression could be considered as negligible in c. canephora  and c. eugenioides , respectively. the results also demonstrated a large variability of cacc expression in leaves of the two studied timor hybrids. both cacc and cace homeologous genes were expressed to similar levels  in the ht832/ <dig> genotype, whereas cacc expression was undetected  in ht832/ <dig> . in introgressed c. arabica genotypes coming from breeding programs that used either ht832/ <dig> or controlled crosses with c. canephora, a great variability in cacc/cace ratios was also observed. for example, high cacc expression was detected in leaves of the ht832/2-derived obat√£, tupi, iapar <dig> , ipr <dig> and ipr <dig> cultivars as well as in those of the interspecific controlled cross icat√∫. however, cacc gene expression was low in the ht832/2-derived ipr <dig> and icat√∫-derived ipr <dig> and ipr <dig> genotypes. for all coffee genotypes analysed, levels of the total rbcs <dig> gene expression evaluated by the t <dig> primer pair appeared quite similar .

primers were designed using primer express software . the source gene indicates the accession numbers of coffee cdna and gene sequences found in the genbank and sol genomics network  libraries and used to design the primer pairs. the size of the amplicon is indicated in base pairs . e: c. eugenioides corresponding to the cace . c: c. canephora corresponding to the cacc . the rbcs1-t primer pair was used to amplify total-rbcs <dig>  transcripts. the rbcs1-dna primer pair was used to amplify the cacc cdna and gene sequences. primer sequences of reference genes previously reported by barsalobres-cavallari et al.  <cit>  are also given .

expression was measured by the ratio cacc/cace where cacc  and cace  values were obtained using the c <dig> and e <dig> primer pairs , respectively. relative quantifications  were normalised using the expression of the ccubq <dig>  or gapdh  reference genes. the cacc/cace ratio corresponded to -Œîct, where Œîct = ctmeancacc - ctmeancace with e as the efficiency of the gene amplification. leaves were collected from plants grown in the field at the embrapa cerrados , iapar station  and ufv greenhouse . when known, the reaction to drought is indicated . all sarchimors are derived from ht832/ <dig> 

rbcs <dig> gene expression in leaves of c. canephora subjected to water stress
the rate of decrease in the predawn leaf water potential   is one of the physiological parameters that distinguished the drought-susceptible clone  <dig> of c. canephora var. conilon from the drought-tolerant clones  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . to reach the imposed Œ®pd of - <dig>  mpa for the stressed  condition in the greenhouse, the rdpwp decreased faster for the clone  <dig> than for drought-tolerant clones . in this condition, the clones  <dig> reached the Œ®pd of - <dig>  mpa within six days, while clones  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reached the same within  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively . as a control and for all the clones, the Œ®pd values of plants under irrigation were close to zero, which confirms the unstressed condition.

the effects of ws on rbcs <dig> gene expression were analysed in leaves of these clones grown under i and ni conditions by a northern blot experiment with an internal rbcs <dig> cdna fragment as a probe . for all the clones, rbcs transcripts of the expected size  were highly detected under the irrigated condition and poorly accumulated under ws. as an internal control, the expression of the ccubq <dig>  reference gene appeared equal for all samples. the expression of rbcs <dig> alleles was also studied by quantitative pcr  for the same clones using the expression of the ccubq <dig> gene as an internal reference . for all clones, the cace expression was negligible, and relative quantification of cacc  was chosen to reflect total rbcs <dig> expression . this analysis also confirmed reduction of cacc gene expression  with ws. in addition, some differences in rbcs <dig> expression were observed between the clones but they were not correlated with phenotypic sensitivity to drought. identical qpcr results were also obtained using gapdh as a reference gene .

rbcs <dig> gene expression in leaves of young plants of c. arabica subjected to water stress
the effects of ws on rbcs <dig> gene expression were further analysed in leaves of young plants of rubi and introgressed i <dig> cultivars grown in field conditions with  or without  irrigation during two consecutive years . two points of analysis were performed every year. the unstressed condition  corresponded to the rainy periods and the water stress  condition to the dry season . in this case, drought was not imposed but determined by the natural rainfall pattern during the dry-wet season cycle. for both cultivars, Œ®pd values of irrigated plants, during the dry season, ranged from - <dig>  to - <dig>  mpa, demonstrating the absence of drought stress. for the ni treatment, lower  values of Œ®pd were observed in  <dig> than in  <dig>  demonstrating that the dry season was more severe during the former than in the latter. in addition, Œ®pd values measured during the dry season of  <dig> and  <dig> were almost less negative for the cultivar i <dig> than for rubi, indicating a better access to soil water for i <dig> than for the rubi cultivar.

young  and adult  plants were grown under irrigated  or non-irrigated  conditions. Œ®pd values are expressed in mega-pascal  and standard deviations  are also indicated. for young plants, Œ®pd was measured during the rainy season  and the dry season . for adult plants, Œ®pd were measured only during the dry season  under irrigated  or with the irrigation suspended for  <dig> days  conditions. the points u <dig>  ws and u <dig> corresponded to measurements before, during and after the return of irrigation, respectively. nd: Œ®pd potentials were not determined but ranged from - <dig>  to - <dig>  mpa under irrigation. the year of analysis  is also indicated.

q-pcr reactions used the primer pairs e <dig>  c <dig> and t <dig> to detect cace , cacc  and total-rbcs <dig>  expression, respectively . independent of water conditions, expression of both the cacc and cace homeologs was always detected in the i <dig> cultivar, whereas cacc expression was not detected in rubi. it is also worth noting that total rbcs <dig> was mostly higher in i <dig> than in rubi. for both cultivars, levels of rqrbcs1-twere quite similar during the unstressed  condition of the year  <dig>  in comparison to the irrigated  condition, rqrbcs1-twas reduced by 30% and 90% in ni plants of the i <dig> cultivar in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in both cases, this reduction affected mainly cacc expression. for the rubi cultivar, the absence of irrigation  also reduced total rbcs <dig> expression by more than 80% in  <dig> and  <dig> 

nine-month-old plants  grown in field conditions were studied during two consecutive years . twenty-month-old plants  were analysed only during the dry season of  <dig>  for each cultivar, the season  and the year  of analysis are indicated: u  corresponding to the rainy season and ws  to the dry season. corresponding predawn leaf water potentials  are given in table  <dig>  rbcs <dig> gene expression was expressed in relative quantification  for the i <dig> , rubi, icat√∫ and obat√£ cultivars grown in the field with  or without  irrigation. rbcs <dig> targets correspond to cace , cacc  and total rbcs <dig>  transcripts amplified by the e <dig>  c <dig> and t <dig> primer pairs , respectively. cc/ce values corresponded to rqcc/rqceratios. for the u- <dig> point of harvest , qpcr analyses were not performed for non-irrigated  plants that were considered identical to irrigated  ones. for the rubi cultivar, cacc gene expression was not detected . in that case, cace expression  and total rbcs <dig> gene expression  was deduced from qpcr experiments that used the e <dig> and t <dig> primer pairs. for obat√£ and i <dig> cultivars analysed in  <dig>  cace - and cacc -specific expression was not determined , and rqrbcs1-twas deduced from qpcr experiments that used the t <dig> primer pair. results were normalised using the expression of the gapdh reference gene.

rbcs <dig> expression was also studied in the young plants of the icat√∫, rubi, obat√£ and i <dig> cultivars subjected  or not subjected  to the severe ws that occurred during the dry season of  <dig>  as shown in the table  <dig>  in the irrigated condition, the i <dig> cultivar showed highest values of total rbcs <dig> expression, while rbcs <dig> expression in the rubi, icat√∫ and obat√£ cultivars was lower and more similar . under ni condition, rqrbcs1-tdecreased for all cultivars, highly  for rubi and to a lower extent  for icat√∫ and obat√£. finally, the i <dig> cultivar was the genotype with the lowest decrease in rbcs <dig> gene expression; the value of rqrbcs1-t during the ni treatment was 65% of that observed under irrigation.

rbcs <dig> gene expression in leaves of adult c. arabica plants subjected to water stress: the effects of time of day
the effects of harvest hour on rbcs <dig> leaf expression were also studied using adult  plants of the rubi and i <dig> cultivars grown in the field under continuous irrigation condition  or subjected to  <dig> days of ws during the dry season of  <dig> . the points of analysis were before , during  and after  the dry season. as in young plants, the Œ®pd values measured for the non-irrigated  treatment during the ws period were less negative for i <dig> than for rubi . on the other hand, the Œ®pd values ranged from - <dig>  to - <dig>  mpa for the irrigated  treatment, demonstrating the absence of ws.

cacc expression  decreased during the transition from u <dig> to ws under i and ni conditions in the i <dig> leaves harvested in the daytime . however, cace gene expression was stable in plants irrigated continuously but decreased with ws in the ni condition. for the rubi cultivar, cace expression  was relatively stable under irrigated conditions for all points of the analysis. however, total rbcs <dig> expression  decreased with ws under ni treatment. the comparison of total rbcs <dig> expression levels between the two cultivars revealed higher  expression in i <dig> than in rubi, with a predominant expression of the cacc over the cace homeolog in the former. for both cultivars, total rbcs <dig> expression values were similar before  and after  the ws period, demonstrating gene expression recovery with the return of irrigation.

leaves of the cultivars i <dig> and rubi were harvested in daytime  or night time . the points of analysis were before , during  and after  the dry season of  <dig>  corresponding predawn leaf water potentials  are given in the table  <dig>  the results of the relative quantification  are given for the cultivars iapar <dig>  and rubi grown in the field with  or without  irrigation during the dry season . rbcs <dig> targets corresponded to cace  and cacc  amplified by the e <dig> and c <dig> primer pairs , respectively. total rbcs <dig> expression  corresponded to rqcc+ rqce, while cc/ce ratios corresponded to the rqcc /rqceratios. for the rubi cultivar, cacc gene expression was not detected . results were normalised using the expression of the gapdh reference gene.

rbcs <dig> expression was also analysed when measuring Œ®pd in leaves harvested at night . as observed for daytime, total rbcs <dig> expression was higher in i <dig> than in rubi. for the i <dig> cultivar, it is worth noting that total nocturnal rbcs <dig> expression during ws was higher than expression measured at daytime in the same plants. for rubi, values of night-time rbcs <dig> expression were quite similar to those determined at daytime.

accumulation of rbcs protein in leaves of c. canephora subjected to water stress
soluble proteins were extracted from leaves harvested at night for clones  <dig>  and  <dig>  of c. canephora var. conilon grown with  or without  irrigation, and they were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis . when looking at the gel portion containing the rbcs proteins, quantitative and qualitative changes of protein profiles were observed during ws . for both cultivars, spots  <dig> and  <dig> were detected under the i and ni conditions. however, spots  <dig> and  <dig> were only detected under water stress. all were characterised by a similar molecular weight but differed in their pis . a detailed analysis of rbsc isoforms was performed for clone  <dig> under ni condition. spot  <dig>  was sequenced and resulted in six peptides  that perfectly matched with the mature isoform of rbcs <dig> protein . peptides  <dig>  and  <dig>  overlapped but differed in their n-terminal amino acid sequence by two residues. peptides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corresponded to the common regions of the cace and cacc rbcs <dig> isoforms, while peptides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> matched only with the cacc isoforms. for clone 14ni, the spectra of tryptic masses of spots  <dig> to  <dig> were very similar . identical results were also obtained for spots  <dig> to  <dig> of clone 22ni . in addition, peptide  <dig> corresponded to the ion m+h  <dig>  that was also observed in the spectra of all rbcs <dig> spots, which confirmed the similarity between these isoforms . for all of these isoforms, peptide mass fingerprinting of the tryptic digestion did not reveal post-translational modifications. this is justified by the fact that some tryptic peptides may not generally be represented in the mass spectrum, notably n-terminal peptides. comparison of tryptic masses revealed that the ions with an m/z of  <dig>  and  <dig> , corresponding to peptide  <dig> , differed by  <dig> da and characterised the loss of an ammonium group from the n-terminal sequence. they were present in rbcs <dig> spots  <dig> and  <dig> but absent in spots  <dig> and  <dig> . however, this peptide  <dig> was conserved in the cace and cacc rbcs <dig> isoforms . the normalised relative abundance, as evaluated by the percentage volume of the spots, clearly indicates an increase in all rbcs <dig> isoforms with drought stress . for example, the amount of rbcs spot  <dig>  increased significantly under ws in the leaves of clones  <dig> and  <dig> . however, quantitative differences between the two genotypes of c. canephora were not observed.

this spot was identified in the leaves of clone  <dig> of c. canephora under the ws condition. six peptides from maldi-tof/tof tryptic mass spectra  were sequenced by ms/ms ion search and de novo sequencing. they are also reported in figure  <dig>  the peptides position refers to the full-length rbcs <dig> protein. peptide masses are shown as the monoisotopic mass .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the mechanisms regulating rubisco activity and its abundance during water stress  are not well characterised. some works have reported that the loss of rubisco activity constitutes an early response to ws  <cit> . in contrast, there is also evidence that more severe stress or stress applied for a longer period also decreases the amount of rubisco  <cit> . numerous studies have investigated the expression of the rbcs genes in response to light or in different tissue types and have shown that transcripts from individual genes accumulate differently . in higher plants, the rbcs genes are very similar to each other, which results in only a few amino acid differences in the rbcs proteins. considering that rbcs complements the structure of rbcl and that evolution is likely to have resulted in specialisation of the different rbcs proteins, it is possible that different rbcs genes may have different impacts on rubisco activity and regulation  <cit> . in this context, the main aims of this work were to identify the alleles of coffee rbcs <dig> gene, to determine the expression of these genes in different species with an emphasis on the polyploid species c. arabica and to study the effects of ws on rbcs <dig> expression in different genotypes and environmental conditions.

the existence of homeologous coffee rbcs <dig> genes was revealed through a search of public databases of coffee ests homologous to the carbcs <dig> cdna sequence previously cloned from c. arabica  <cit> . here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the rbcs <dig> cdna and its corresponding gene from c. canephora . nucleic acid alignments demonstrated that the rbcs1-cc cdna matched with rbcs <dig> ests expressed in both the c. canephora and c. arabica cdna libraries  <cit> . in the latter species, rbcs <dig> ests identical to the previously-cloned carbcs <dig> cdna and gene sequences also corresponded to a rbcs <dig> read in c. eugenioides. rbcs <dig> sequence alignments also revealed the existence of some nucleic differences that could correspond to sequencing errors or real snps that characterise the different alleles of rbcs <dig>  access to coffee whole genome sequences could help to resolve these points  <cit> . it is also worth noting that all the rbcs genomic sequences amplified from the  <dig> different genotypes of c. arabica  were identical to carbcs <dig> rather than rbcs1-cc. this should be explained by the fact that these genes were probably amplified by specific primers that recognise the carbcs <dig> allele carried by the c. eugenioides sub-genome. altogether, these results clearly showed that two homeologous rbcs <dig> genes were expressed in c. arabica, one from the ccrbcs <dig> gene , which was carried by the c. canephora sub-genome of c. arabica, and the other from the carbcs <dig> gene , which was carried by the c. eugenioides sub-genome of c. arabica. thus, our results once again confirmed that the ancient c. canephora and c. eugenioides genomes constitute the two different sub-genomes of c. arabica  <cit> . comparison of the rbcs1-cc and rbcs1-ce  gene sequences also revealed interspecific sequence polymorphisms characterised by several indels mainly in the introns and in the 3' utr region. intraspecific sequence polymorphisms were also observed in c. canephora, and they permitted the recent mapping of the ccrbcs <dig> gene to the g linkage group of the c. canephora genetic map  <cit> .

the expression variability of rbcs <dig> alleles was further tested in different coffee species and genotypes of c. arabica using specific primer pairs designed to the 3' utr region of the rbcs <dig> cdnas. our results clearly demonstrated high cacc  expression in c. canephora and high cace  expression in c. eugenioides. after this validation, expression of the homeologous rbcs <dig> genes was analysed in the different genotypes of c. arabica. these highlighted the predominant expression of the homeologous cace over the cacc genes in the leaves of non-introgressed  c. arabica cultivars such as typica, bourbon and catua√≠; the former two cultivars correspond to the base populations that generated the latter cultivar  <cit> . in a previous study, petitot et al.  <cit>  also reported that the cawrky1a and cawrky1b genes of c. arabica, which encode for transcription factors of the wrky family, originated from the two parental sub-genomes of this coffee species. in that case, cawrky1a and cawrky1b were concomitantly expressed, and both homeologous genes contributed to the transcriptional expression of coffee defence responses to pathogens. the result presented here are quite different, because they clearly highlighted the predominant expression of the cace over the cacc homeologous gene for the non-introgressed genotypes of c. arabica and suggested that specific suppression of cacc expression occurred during the evolutionary processes that led to the creation of the c. arabica species. this observation is in agreement with the recent results of vidal et al.  <cit> , who reported that within c. arabica, the c. eugenioides sub-genome may express genes coding for proteins that assume basal biological processes , while the c. canephora sub-genome contributes to adjust arabica gene expression by expressing genes coding for regulatory proteins.

another noteworthy result concerned the differential expression of the rbcs <dig> homeolog genes in timor hybrids ht832/ <dig> and ht832/ <dig> as well as in the icat√∫- or ht832/2-derived  varieties. the qpcr experiments presented here clearly showed that the cace and cacc homeologs were co-expressed with the same order of magnitude in ht832/ <dig>  while cacc expression was undetectable in ht832/ <dig>  most of the ht832/2-derived cultivars showed preferential expression of cacc over the cace homeolog. however, icat√∫-derived ipr <dig> and ipr <dig>  as well as ht832/2-derived ipr <dig>  presented the inverse situation of low expression of cacc. the simplest hypothesis would be the existence of one or several genetic factors activating the expression of sub-genome cacc genes in the c. canephora  species when introgressed with c. arabica. the rbcs1-cc gene itself might be this genetic factor, but it might also be one or several other introgressed genes involving epistatic regulation. epistasis is now proven to have a crucial role in gene regulation  <cit>  and even in the heterosis phenomena  <cit> . under this hypothesis, pure c. arabica does not express rbcs1-cc in the absence of the cc genetic factor. introgressed c. arabica does or does not include the cc genetic factor depending on the actual cc genome introgressed. during selection from introgressed material, the percentage of the cc genome tends to decrease because i) backcrosses are often directed toward a pure c. arabica parent and ii) phenotypic selection is directed towards c. arabica characteristics. indeed, only disease-resistant genes from c. canephora are desired, while other genes that are part of the genetic drag lead to a decrease in cup quality  <cit> . the recently introgressed c. canephora genome has been estimated to represent  <dig> to  <dig> percent of the whole genome of introgressed varieties of c. arabica  <cit> . however, bertrand et al  <cit>  showed that differences in the cup quality of various introgressed varieties was not explained by the quantity of the introgressed c. canephora genome, thus suggesting that the types of introgressed genes are more important than the quantity of introgressed genome. in our study, it could be hypothesised that the cc genetic factor is absent in ht832/ <dig> and present in ht832/ <dig> accessions of timor hybrids. ht832/2-derived introgressed lines express rbcs1-cc if the cc factor has been maintained in the selection process. this would be the case for all ht832/2-derived varieties except in ipr <dig>  which might have lost the cc genetic factor during selection. under this hypothesis, both icat√∫-derived genotypes ipr <dig> and ipr <dig> would have lost the cc genetic factor. no ht832/1-derived varieties were part of our study. however, such varieties should not express rbcs1-cc, as the cc factor would be absent in ht832/ <dig>  checking the expression of rbcs1-cc in ht832/1-derived varieties would thus reinforce or discard the hypothesis of a cc genetic factor that epistatically regulates the expression of this gene. however, rbcs <dig> represents a potentially useful model to explore the differential expression of both the cacc and cace sub-genome of c. arabica. such experiments would advance our understanding of how epistasis regulates the gene expression of different sub-genomes in an amphidiploid species. differential gene expression from both whole sub-genomes of c. arabica has been recently studied through a coffee-specific microarray  <cit> . this work allowed a more specific study that showed a preferential general expression of cacc and cace genes at higher and lower temperatures, respectively  <cit> . well-designed rbcs <dig> expression studies might provide a powerful single gene model for drought resistance and epistatic regulation in an amphidiploid and may contribute to a better understanding of epigenetic regulation in plant polyploids and its relationship to polyploidy advantages  <cit> . recent genomic resources from c. canephora, including a dense genetic map  <cit> , will help precise tracking of the introgressed c. canephora genome and possibly aid in understanding the functioning of the cc genetic factor responsible for cacc expression in introgressed varieties.

another aim of this work was to study the effects of ws on rbcs expression in different coffee species. in higher plants, several works reported the rapid decrease in abundance of rbcs transcripts with ws and, consequentially, a reduction in rbcs protein accumulation in leaves  <cit> . in our conditions, it is worth noting that the decreases of Œ®pd were much slower for field-grown plants of c. arabica than those for c. canephora grown in a greenhouse. in addition, and except in  <dig>  the Œ®pd values observed for c. arabica during the period of maximum ws, were much less negative than those of c. canephora. this clearly demonstrated that the ws conditions were not equivalent between the two studies and that the stress suffered by the clones of c. canephora was more severe than the stress applied to the rubi and i <dig> cultivars of c. arabica. for the latter and in young and adult plants, Œ®pd values under ws always appeared less negative for i <dig> than rubi indicating better access to soil water for the former than the latter  <cit> . regarding rbcs <dig> gene expression, the results presented here clearly showed a drastic decrease in total rbcs <dig> transcripts with severe ws for c. canephora. irrespective of the clone analysed, total rbcs <dig>  gene expression was reduced by 75% in ws-plants with a leaf predawn water potential  of - <dig>  mpa. independently of plant age, a drought-induced decrease of total  rbcs <dig> transcripts was also observed for the two field-grown cultivars  of c. arabica subjected to ws. for i <dig>  ws reduced the daytime expression of both the cacc and cace homeologous genes, whereas only cacc expression declined at night. q-pcr experiments showed higher rbcs <dig> gene expression in i <dig> but also showed a lower extent of gene expression for the icat√∫ and obat√£ cultivars than for the rubi cultivar. for the latter, total rbcs <dig> gene expression was lower at night time than at daytime suggesting reduced transcription or an increase in transcript turnover under nocturnal conditions. however, the opposite seems to occur for the i <dig> cultivar, which shows a nocturnal increase in total rbcs <dig> gene expression, mainly mediated by enhanced cacc expression. together with the Œ®pd measurements, these results demonstrate the different behaviours of c. arabica cultivars during drought stress and suggest that those introgressed with a c. canephora genome could better tolerate ws conditions than cultivars of "pure" c. arabica.

it is well known that expression of the rbcs genes is positively regulated by light . in addition, several works also reported that increased sugar  levels can trigger repression of photosynthetic gene transcription including rbcs  <cit> . however, diurnal rbcs expression and light/dark oscillation of rbcs mrna in an inverse timeframe to the normal daytime accumulation and night mobilisation of leaf carbohydrates previously reported  <cit> . praxedes et al.  <cit>  showed increased concentration of sucrose and hexoses, probably coming from enhanced starch degradation, in ws leaves of clone  <dig> of c. canephora that could also be explained by the daytime decrease of rbcs <dig> transcripts reported here.

in order to see if this reduction in rbcs <dig> gene expression also affected the amount of the corresponding protein, 2-de experiments were performed to study rbcs <dig> proteins in the leaves of clones  <dig>  and  <dig>  of c. canephora var. conilon grown with  or without  ws. for both clones, drought stress increased the amount of the main rbcs <dig> isoform corresponding to spot  <dig> and also led to the accumulation of at least three other rbcs isoforms of identical molecular weight but different pis. comparison of the tryptic mass profile by peptide mass fingerprinting revealed the absence of some peptides in the different rbsc <dig> isoforms, such as for spots  <dig> and  <dig>  that did not contain peptide  <dig>  in addition, other ions that could correspond to this peptide were not found. it is possible that peptide  <dig> was not detected due to posttranslational modifications that modify its mass. another possibility is that spots  <dig> and  <dig> really corresponded to rbcs alleles that differed from rbcs <dig> proteins as in c. arabica, where differential expression of rbsc alleles under drought stress was observed . in the literature, few examples showed up-regulation of rbcs gene expression with drought stress accompanied by the rubisco increase  <cit> . altogether, the results presented here suggest a decoupling between rbcs <dig> gene expression and the accumulation of rbcs <dig> protein during ws.

several hypotheses could be proposed to explain why the decline of photosynthetic co <dig> fixation  with drought stress previously reported for clones  <dig> and  <dig> of c. canephora var. conilon  <cit>  is not accompanied by a decrease in amount of rbcs <dig> protein. the first hypothesis could involve the participation of rubisco binding proteins  that stabilise, protect and activate the rubisco holoenzyme under adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . proteins such as chaperones, rubisco activase, clp atp-dependent calpain protease and detoxifying enzymes have been shown to play such roles that favour rubisco accumulation and stabilisation by preventing its damage under drought stress  <cit> . it is worth noting that ws increased expression of genes coding for small hsp proteins, as observed in the leaves of clones  <dig> and  <dig> of c. canephora  <cit> . in addition, high activities of detoxifying enzymes  were also reported in the leaves of water-stressed clones  <dig> and  <dig> of c. canephora  <cit> . the second possibility is that accumulation of rbcs <dig> protein could come from the expression of other rbcs alleles up-regulated during ws to compensate for the down-regulation of rbcs <dig>  however, because the decrease of rbcs <dig> gene expression was confirmed by qpcr experiments using different primer sets, including one pair designed to the rbcs-coding sequence that should be extremely conserved within the coffee rbcs gene family, this hypothesis seems unlikely. a third possibility is that rbcs <dig> protein accumulated under ws came from the translation of rbcs <dig> mrna transcribed overnight. this hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out because nocturnal rbcs <dig> expression was effectively observed in leaves of the i <dig> and rubi cultivars of c. arabica. in that case, nocturnal accumulation of rbcs <dig> mrnas could participate in maintaining the high daytime amount of rbcs <dig> protein even under a sharp reduction in rbcs <dig> gene expression. this should also favour a quick recovery of photosynthetic capacity under favourable environmental conditions and help coffee plants to cope with ws  <cit> .

water stress can directly affect photosynthesis by causing changes in plant metabolism or by limiting the amount of co <dig> available for fixation  <cit> . although stomatal closure generally occurs when plants are exposed to drought, in some cases photosynthesis may be more controlled by the capacity to fix co <dig> than by increased diffusive resistance  <cit> . if rubisco is not a limiting enzyme for carbon fixation under drought, the impaired activity of enzymes involved in the regeneration of rubisco or in the calvin cycle  could be responsible for the drought-induced decrease in photosynthetic capacity  <cit> . in addition to the carboxylase activity, rubisco has also oxygenase activity. this process, called photorespiration, can protect the photosynthetic apparatus against photoinhibition by keeping the electron transport chain active, thus limiting electron accumulation and ros formation. this could explain why photoinhibitory damages were not observed in water-stressed coffee plants  <cit> . in that case, rubisco could confer acclimatisation to oxidative stress under water deficit. the true mechanism of rubisco contribution to water and oxidative stress responses in coffee plants still remains obscure and highlights the necessity for additional detailed studies to precisely determine its contribution.

the work presented here is the first to  investigate the effects of drought stress on gene expression with coffee plants grown in the field,  compare these results with those obtained for coffee plants grown under ws intensities and  analyse the transcriptome response of the two main coffee species, while taking into account the complex regulation of homeolog genes in c. arabica and opening the way to further sharpen understanding of epistatic regulation of sub-genome expression in an amphidiploid species. these results constitute only one part of a broader project that aims to study the effects of drought stress on biomass, architecture, anatomy and eco-physiological parameters of rubi and i <dig> cultivars  <cit> . the integration of these data with ongoing studies of candidate genes should help us to understand the genetic determinants of drought tolerance in coffee, which constitutes an essential step in the improvement of coffee-breeding programs.
