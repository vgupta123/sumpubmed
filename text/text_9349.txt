BACKGROUND
experimental and computational results estimate that 5–10% of the human genome has recently duplicated  <cit> . these estimates represent the total proportion of low-copy repeats , which are defined as homologous blocks of sequence from two distinct genomic locations  > <dig> base pairs in length. lcrs, which are also referred to in the literature as recent segmental duplications, may contain all of the various sequence elements, such as genes, pseudogenes, and high-copy repeats. a set of homologous lcrs make up an lcr family. non-allelic homologous recombination between members of an lcr family can cause chromosomal rearrangements with health-related consequences  <cit> . while data are not yet available to understand the mechanistic basis of lcr duplication, mechanisms will emerge through the study of individual cases  <cit> .

at the same time, the appearance of lcr duplicates may be an artifact arising from one of a number of problems in the assembly of a genome of interest. especially when classical repetitive sequences are involved, it is conceivable that mistaken assembly of sequencing contigs might create in a draft sequence of a genome a repeat where none exists. in the post-genomic world, rules have not yet become accepted in the community to decide when the burden of proof favors one interpretation  over another . again, these rules will emerge over time through the study of individual cases.

through the assembly of many case studies, more general features of duplication and evolutionary processes that retain duplicates should emerge. although each lcr family originates from one progenitor locus, no universal features explain why the particular current progenitor loci have been duplicated instead of other genomic regions. from an evolutionary perspective, duplicated material is central to creating new function, and to speciation. one intriguing hypothesis is that genes whose duplication and recruitment have been useful to meet current darwinian challenges find themselves in regions of the chromosome that favor the generation of lcrs.

browsing a naturally organized database of biological sequences, we identified human cytosolic sulfotransferase  1a as a recently expanded gene family with biomedically related functions. sult1a enzymes conjugate sulfuryl groups to hydroxyl or amino groups on exogenous substrates , which typically facilitates elimination of the xenobiotic by the excretory system  <cit> . sulfonation, however, also bioactivates certain pro-mutagenic and pro-carcinogenic molecules encountered in the diet and air, making it of interest to cancer epidemiologists  <cit> . these enzymes also function physiologically by sulfonating a range of endogenous molecules, such as steroid and thyroid hormones, neurotransmitters, bile salts, and cholesterol  <cit> .

three human sult1a genes have been reported  <cit> . the human sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> enzymes are ~98% identical and recognize many different phenolic compounds such as p-nitrophenol and α-naphthol  <cit> . the human sult1a <dig> enzyme is ~93% identical to sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig>  but preferentially recognizes dopamine and other catecholamines over other phenolic compounds  <cit> . high resolution crystal structures of sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> enzymes have been solved  <cit> . amino acid differences that contribute to the phenolic and dopamine substrate preferences of the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> enzymes, respectively, have been localized to the active site  <cit> .

polymorphic alleles of sult1a <dig>  1a <dig>  and 1a <dig> exist in the human population  <cit> . an allele known as sult1a1* <dig> contains a non-synonymous polymorphism, displays only ~15% of wild type sulfonation activity in platelets, and is found in ~30% of individuals in some populations  <cit> . numerous studies comparing sult1a <dig> genotypes in cancer versus control cohorts demonstrate that the low-activity sult1a1* <dig> allele is a cancer risk factor  <cit> , although other studies have failed to find an association  <cit> . ironically, the protection from carcinogens conferred by the high activity sult1a1* <dig> allele is counterbalanced by risks associated with its activation of pro-carcinogens. for example, sult1a enzymes bioactivate the pro-carcinogen 2-amino-α-carboline found in cooked food, cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust  <cit> . the sulfate conjugates of aromatic parent compounds convert to reactive electrophiles by losing electron-withdrawing sulfate groups. the resulting electrophilic cations form mutagenic dna adducts leading to cancer.

recently, it has become widely understood that placing a complex biomolecular system within an evolutionary model helps generate hypotheses concerning function. this process has been termed "phylogenomics"  <cit> . through our bioinformatic and phylogenomic efforts on the sulfotransferase 1a system, we detected a previously unidentified human gene that is very similar to sult1a <dig>  transcriptionally active, and not found in the chimpanzee. in addition, we report that all four human sult1a genes are located on lcrs in a region of chromosome  <dig> replete with other lcrs. a model of sult1a gene family expansion in the hominoid lineage  is presented, complete with date estimates of three preserved duplication events and identification of the progenitor locus. positively selected protein sites were identified that might have been central in adapting the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> enzymes to their role in sulfonating catecholamines such as dopamine and other structurally related drugs.

RESULTS
four human sult1a genes on chromosome  <dig> lcrs
the human sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> genes are tandemly arranged  <dig> kilobase pairs  apart in the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig>  while the sult1a <dig> gene is located ~ <dig>  million base pairs  away . in addition to the three known sult1a genes, we found a fourth gene, sult1a <dig>  by searching the human genome with the blast-like alignment tool  <cit> . sult1a <dig> was located midway between the sult1a1/1a <dig> gene cluster and the sult1a <dig> gene .

the sult1a <dig> gene resided on  <dig> kbp of sequence that was highly identical to  <dig> kbp of sequence surrounding the sult1a <dig> gene . the high sequence identity between the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> genomic regions suggested that they were part of a low copy repeat  family. this suspicion was confirmed by mining the recent segmental duplication database of human lcr families  <cit> . in addition to the four-member sult1a lcr family, the  <dig> kbp sult1a <dig> lcr was related to  <dig> other lcrs . many of the sult1a3-related lcrs are members of the previously identified lcr16a family  <cit> . the sult1a3-related lcrs mapping to chromosome  <dig> collectively amounted to  <dig>  mbp of sequence – or  <dig> % of chromosome  <dig> 

*lcr names are as in figure  <dig>  †percent identity is relative to the 1a <dig> lcr.

to determine if other genes in the sult super family were also recently duplicated during lcr expansions, we searched the segmental duplication database  <cit>  for human reference genes located on lcrs. no other complete cytosolic sult genes were located on lcrs, but 25% of the sult2a <dig> open reading frame  was located on an lcr .

the steroid sulfatase gene, which encodes an enzyme that removes sulfate groups from the same biomolecules recognized and sulfonated by sult enzymes, is frequently deleted in patients with scaly skin  due to nonallelic homologous recombination between lcrs on chromosome x  <cit> . as demonstrated by the x-linked icthyosis example, sult1a copy number or activity in the human population could be modified – with health-related consequences – by nonallelic homologous recombination between lcrs on chromosome  <dig> 

sult1a4: genomic and transcriptional evidence
the sequence of the sult1a <dig> gene region from the human reference genome was so similar to that of the sult1a <dig> region  that the differences were near those that might arise from sequencing error or allelic variation. it was conceivable, therefore, that some combination of sequence error, allelic variation, and/or faulty genome construction generated the appearance of a sult1a <dig> gene that does not actually exist. we therefore searched for additional evidence that the sult1a <dig> gene was material.

we asked whether any evidence was consistent with the hypothesis of an artificial sult1a <dig> lcr from erroneous genome assembly, as opposed to the existence of a true duplicate region. here, the quality of the genomic sequencing is important. the junction regions at the ends of the sult1a <dig> lcr were sufficiently covered; at least nine sequencing contigs overlapped either junction boundary . this amount of evidence has been used in other studies to judge the genomic placement of lcrs  <cit> .

as another line of evidence, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> genomic regions . among the  <dig> coding positions the only difference was at position  <dig>  where sult1a <dig> possessed adenine  and sult1a <dig> possessed guanine . thus, if two genes do exist, they differ by one silent transition at the third position of codon  <dig>  the untranslated regions, however, contained thirteen nucleotide differences while the introns contained seven additional differences . these  <dig> differences between the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> genomic regions disfavor the hypothesis that sequencing errors played a role in the correct/incorrect placement of these lcrs.

*  <dig> alignment positions are shown where the nucleotide/gapping  of the sult1a <dig> region differed from that of the sult1a <dig> region. exon and intron names of the sult1a <dig> gene are according to  <cit> . all nucleotides are numbered relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon, which has a value of + <dig>  there was no position 'zero'. the last nucleotide of the coding sequence occurs at position + <dig> . approximately  <dig> kb of upstream  and downstream  nucleotides were included in the comparison.

the sult1a <dig> gene was located near the junction of two lcrs . for this reason, it was not clear whether sult1a <dig> had a functional promoter. we took a bioinformatic approach to address this question. expressed sequences ascribed to sult1a <dig> were downloaded from the ncbi unigene website  <cit> . each sequence was aligned to sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> genomic regions. based on the a/g polymorphism at the third position of codon  <dig>  five expressed sequences were assigned to sult1a <dig> and nine to sult1a <dig> . other expressed sequences were unclassified because they did not overlap codon  <dig>  if the sult1a <dig> does exist, there is ample evidence from expressed sequences to make conclusions about its transcriptional activity.

*gene classifications made according to the nucleotide at position  <dig> as described in the text. †tissue descriptions were taken from genbank accessions.

the codon  <dig> a/g polymorphism was reported as allelic variation in sult1a <dig> by thomae et al.  <cit> . it is conceivable that thomae et al. sequenced both sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> because of the identical sequences surrounding them. in their study, 89% of caa  and 11% of cag  codon  <dig> alleles were detected in one population. why were the frequencies not more equal, as would be expected if sult1a <dig> is always caa and sult1a <dig> is cag? one hypothesis is that sult1a <dig> is indeed cag/caa polymorphic as reported, while sult1a <dig> is always caa. interestingly, in both the chimpanzee and gorilla, codon  <dig> of sult1a <dig> is caa. this implies that the ancestral sult1a <dig> gene  likely had a caa codon. an a to g transition might have been fixed in a fraction of sult1a <dig> genes after the divergence of humans and great apes. if this scenario is true, some transcripts assigned to sult1a <dig> on the basis of codon  <dig> may actually be from individuals expressing the ancestral caa version of sult1a <dig> 

sult1a progenitor locus
we aligned the coding sequences of all available sult1a genes and used various nucleotide distance metrics and tree-building algorithms to infer the gene tree without constraints. the unconstrained topology placed platypus as the out group, with the placental mammals ordered ),))). this differed from the topology inferred while constraining for the most likely relationships among mammalian orders ), ), primates)))  <cit> . we considered both trees, and found that the conclusions drawn throughout the paper were robust with regard to these different topologies. therefore, only the tree inferred while constraining for most likely relationships among mammalian orders is discussed .

using the transition redundant exchange  molecular dating tool  <cit> , we placed upper-limit date estimates at the sult1a duplication nodes . the sult1a gene family appears to have expanded ~ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> million years ago . therefore, the sult1a duplications likely occurred after the divergence of hominoids and old world monkeys, with the most recent duplication occurring even after the divergence of humans and great apes.

mouse, rat, and dog genomes each contained a single sult1a gene. the simplest evolutionary model, therefore, predicted that one of the four hominoid sult1a loci was orthologous to the rodent sult1a <dig> gene. syntenic regions have conserved order of genetic elements along a chromosomal segment and evidence of synteny between homologous regions is useful for establishing relationships of orthology and paralogy. human sult1a <dig> is most like rodent sult1a <dig> in sequence and function and before the advent of whole genome sequencing it was assumed that they were syntenic and therefore orthologous  <cit> . complete genome sequences have since emerged and alignments between them are available in the visualization tool for alignments  database of human-rodent genome alignments  <cit> . the vista database contains mouse-human pairwise alignments and mouse-rat-human multiple alignments. the multiple alignments were found to be more sensitive for predicting true orthologous regions between rodent and human genomes  <cit> . we searched the vista database for evidence of any human-rodent syntenic regions involving the four sult1a loci. the more sensitive multiple alignments failed to record any human-rodent syntenic regions involving the sult1a <dig>  sult1a <dig>  or sult1a <dig> loci but detected synteny involving the sult1a <dig> loci and both rodent genomes . these results are indicative of a hominoid specific sult1a family expansion from a progenitor locus corresponding to the genomic region that now contains sult1a <dig>  the results from the vista database were not as clear when the less sensitive alignment method was employed .

sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> lcrs were  <dig> % identical overall . more careful inspection revealed that the sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig> lcrs were  <dig> % identical over the first  <dig> kbp, but only  <dig> % identical over the last  <dig> kbp . this 10-fold difference in percent identities  suggested that the sult1a4-containing lcr was produced by two independent duplications. the chimpanzee draft genome assembly aligned with the human genome  <cit>  provides evidence in support of this hypothesis. there is conserved synteny between human and chimp genomes over the last  <dig> kbp of the 1a4-containing lcr, but no synteny over the first  <dig> kbp where the sult1a <dig> gene is located . this finding and the trex date estimate for the sult1a3/1a <dig> duplication event at ~ <dig> ma indicate that sult1a <dig> is a human invention not shared by chimpanzees – our closest living relatives.

it should be noted that the chimpanzee genome assembly is less reliable than the assembly of the human genome. the coverage is significantly lower, and the methods used for assembly are viewed by many as being less reliable, in part because they relied on the human assembly. other possibilities, less supported the available evidence, should be considered, including deletion of the chimpanzee sult1a <dig> gene since the human-chimp divergence, or failure of the draft chimpanzee genome assembly to detect the  <dig> kbp segment on which the sult1a <dig> gene resides.

adaptive evolution in hominoids
from an analysis of gene sequence change over time, molecular evolutionary theory can generate hypotheses about whether duplication has led to functional redundancy, or whether the duplicates have adopted separate functional roles. if the latter, molecular evolutionary theory can suggest how different the functional roles might be by seeking evidence for positive  selection for mutant forms of the native proteins better able to contribute to fitness.

positive selection of protein function can best be hypothesized when the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  changes normalized to the number of non-synonymous and synonymous sites throughout the entire gene sequence  is greater than unity. various models of evolutionary sequence change can be used to calculate these ratios. the simplest assumes a single ka/ks ratio over the entire tree . more complex models assume an independent ratio for each lineage , variable ratios for specific classes of sequence sites , or variable ratios for specific classes of sequence sites along specified branches   <cit> .

estimating the free parameters in each of these models by the maximum likelihood method  <cit>  enables testing two nested evolutionary models as competing hypotheses, where one model is a special case of another model. the likelihood ratio test  statistic, which is twice the log likelihood difference between the nested models, is comparable to a χ <dig> distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in free parameters between the models  <cit> . evidence for adaptive evolution typically requires a ka/ks ratio > <dig> and a statistically significant lrt  <cit> .

we estimated ka/ks ratios for each branch in the 1a gene tree by maximum likelihood with the paml program  <cit> . a typical branch in the sult1a gene tree had a ratio of  <dig> , and the ratio was  <dig>  on the branch separating extant sult1a3/1a <dig> genes from the single sult1a gene in the last common ancestor of hominoids . thus, the ka/ks ratio estimated as an average over all sites did not suggest adaptive evolution along the 1a3/1a <dig> branch.

we then implemented three site-specific and two branch-site evolutionary models that allow ka/ks ratios to vary among sites. four of the five models estimated that a proportion of sites  had ka/ks > <dig> . each model was statistically better at the  <dig> or 95% confidence level than the appropriate null model as determined using the lrt statistic . table  <dig> lists the specific sites that various analyses identified as being potentially involved in positive selection and a subset of these sites that are changing along the sult1a3/1a <dig> branch.

*f.p. is the number of free parameters in each model. †evidence for positive selection is shown in boldface. proportions of sites in each ka/ks class, p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  were not free parameters when in parentheses. neutral site-specific model assumes two site classes having fixed ka/ks ratios of  <dig> and  <dig>  with the proportion of sites in each class estimated as free parameters. selection site-specific model assumes a third proportion of sites with ka/ks estimated from the data. discrete model assumes  <dig> or  <dig> site classes  with the proportion of sites, and ka/ks ratios for each proportion, estimated as free parameters. beta model assumes a beta distribution of sites, where the distribution is shaped by the parameters p and q. beta+selection model assumes an additional class of sites having a ka/ks ratio estimated from the data. model a, an extension of the neutral model, assumes a third site class on the 1a3/1a <dig> branch with ka/ks estimated from the data. model b, an extension of the discrete model with two site classes , also assumes a third site class on the 1a3/1a <dig> branch with ka/ks estimated from the data.

*in parentheses for each positively selected site is the posterior probability that the site belongs to the class with ka/ks > <dig>  posterior probabilities >90% are bold-face. positively selected sites also experiencing non-synonymous change on the 1a3/1a <dig> branch are underlined.

a hypothesis of adaptive change that is based on the use of ka/ksvalues can be strengthened by joining the molecular evolutionary analysis to an analysis based on structural biology  <cit> . here, we ask whether the sites possibly involved in an episode of sequence evolution are, or are not, randomly distributed in the three dimensional structure. to ask this question, we mapped the sites to the sult1a structure . sites holding amino acids whose codons had suffered synonymous replacements were evenly distributed throughout the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, as expected for silent changes that have no impact on the protein structure and therefore cannot be selected for or against at the protein level . in contrast, sites experiencing non-synonymous replacements during the episode following the duplication that created the new hominoid gene are clustered on the side of the protein near the substrate binding site and the channel through which the substrate gains access to the active site . this strengthens the hypothesis that replacements at the sites are indeed adaptive. the approach employed here based on structural biology does not lend itself easily to evaluation using statistical metrics. rather, the results are valuable based on the visual impression that they give, and the hypotheses that they generate.

* sites underlined were identified as being positively selected using the branch-site specific models. †posterior probabilities that the ancestral residues are correct, conditional on the model of sequence evolution used.

we then examined literature where amino acids had been exchanged between sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig>  one of the sites, at position  <dig>  identified as being involved in adaptive change, is known to control substrate specificity in sult1a <dig> and 1a <dig>  <cit> . the remaining sites identified are nearby.

CONCLUSIONS
an interesting question in post-genomic science asks how to create biological hypotheses from various drafts of whole genome sequences. in generating these hypotheses, it is important to remember that a genomic sequence is itself a hypothesis, about the chemical structure of a small number of dna molecules. in many cases, biologists wish to move from the genomic sequence, as a hypothesis, to create hypotheses about biological function, without first "proving" the genome sequence hypothesis.

this type of process, building hypotheses upon unproven hypotheses, is actually common in science. in fact, very little of what we believe as fact is actually "proven"; formal proof is virtually unknown in science that involves observation, theory, and experiment. rather, scientists generally accumulate data until a burden of proof is met, with the standards for that burden being determined by experience within a culture. in general, scientists have an idea in an area as to what level of validation is sufficient to avoid making mistakes an unacceptable fraction of the time, and proceed to that level in their ongoing work, until they encounter a situation where they make a mistake , or encounter enough examples where a lower standard works, and therefore come to accept a lower standard routinely  <cit> .

genomics has not yet accumulated enough examples for the culture to define the standards for a burden of proof. in the example discussed here, several lines of reasoning would be applied to analyze the sulfotransferase gene family. first, the fact that the draft genome for chimpanzee contains three paralogs, while the draft genome for human contains four, would normally be interpreted  as evidence that an additional duplication occurred in the time since chimpanzee and humans diverged. it would also, however, be consistent with the loss of one of four hypothetical genes present in the common ancestor of chimpanzee and humans in the lineage leading to chimpanzee. another possibility is that the finishing stages of the chimpanzee genome project will uncover a sult1a <dig> gene.

normally, one would resolve this question using an out group taxon, a species that diverged from the lineage leading to chimpanzee and human before chimpanzee and human themselves diverged. the nearest taxa that might serve as an out group today are, however, rat and mouse. as noted above, they diverged so long ago  that the comparison provides no information. and no closer out group taxon  has had its genome completely sequenced.

here, the two hypotheses  are distinguished  based on an analysis of the silent nucleotide substitutions using the trex metric. the very small number of nucleotide differences separating the sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> coding regions favors the generation of the two paralogs after chimpanzee and human diverged.

this comparison, however, potentially suffers from the statistics of small numbers. the number of differences in the coding region  is small. by considering ~ <dig> kbp of non-coding sequence, however, additional differences were found. it is possible that in the assembly of the human genome, a mistake was made that led to the generation of a sult1a <dig> region that does not actually exist. in this hypothesis, the ~ <dig> nucleotide differences between the sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> paralogs must be the consequence of allelic polymorphism in the only gene that exists. this is indeed how some of the data were initially interpreted.

does the preponderance of evidence favor the hypothesis of a very recent duplication to generate a pair of paralogs ? or does the evidence favor the hypothesis that the sult1a <dig> gene is an illusion arising from gene assembly error coupled to sequencing errors and/or allelic variation at ca.  <dig> sites? the culture does not yet have a standard of assigning the burden of proof here, although a choice of hypothesis based simply on the count of the number of mistakes that would need to have been made to generate each hypothesis  would favor the former over the latter. thus, perhaps naively, the burden of proof now favors the former, and we may proceed to generate the biological hypothesis on top of the genomic hypothesis.

here, the hypothesis has immediate pharmacogenomic and genomic disease implications due to the specific functional behaviors of sult1a enzymes. lcr-mediated genomic rearrangements could disrupt or amplify human sult1a gene copy number. given our current environmental exposure to many forms of carcinogens and pro-carcinogens that are either eliminated or activated by sult enzymes, respectively, it is plain to see how sult1a copy number variability in the human population could underlie cancer susceptibilities and drug or food allergies.

the majority of evidence indicates that a new transcriptionally active human gene, which we refer to as sult1a <dig>  was created when  <dig> kbp of chromosome  <dig> duplicated after humans diverged from great apes. thus, sult1a <dig>  or possibly another gene in this region, is likely to contribute to distinguishing humans from their closest living relatives. it is also conceivable that an advantage in gene regulation, as opposed to an advantage from gene duplication, was the driving force behind the duplication of this  <dig> kbp segment. while cause and effect are difficult to separate, the examples presented here support the hypothesis that genes whose duplication and recruitment are useful to meet current darwinian challenges find themselves located on lcrs.

the sult1a <dig> gene is currently the most obvious feature of the duplicated region and has been preserved for ~ <dig> my without significant divergence of its coding sequence. one suggestion for the usefulness of sult1a <dig> is that it expanded sulfonating enzymes to new tissues. the sult1a <dig> gene is located only  <dig> kbp upstream from the junction boundary of its lcr and  <dig> kbp away from the sult1a <dig> locus. it is possible, therefore, that promoter elements from the new genomic context of the sult1a <dig> gene would drive its expression in tissues where sult1a <dig> is not expressed – a hypothesis testable by more careful transcriptional profiling.

multiple sult1a genes were apparently useful inventions by our stem hominoid ancestor. following the duplication of an ancestral primate sult1a gene ~ <dig> ma, positive selection acted on a small proportion of sites in one of the duplicates to create the dopamine sulfonating sult1a <dig> enzyme. in the example presented here, the evidence of adaptive change at certain sites is corroborated by the ad hoc observation that the sites cluster near the active site of the protein. the well known substrate binding differences at the active sites of sult1a1/1a <dig> and sult1a <dig>  substantiate these findings.

when studying well-characterized proteins as we have done here, episodes of functional change can be identified by piecing together several lines of evidence. it is not immediately possible, unfortunately, to assemble as much evidence for the majority of proteins in the biosphere. thus, an important goal in bioinformatics is to recognize the signal of functional change from a restricted amount of evidence. of the three lines of evidence employed here , structural biology, with its obvious connections to protein function and impending growth from structural genomics initiatives, will probably be the most serviceable source of information for most protein families. this should be especially true for protein families not amenable to experimental manipulation, or with deep evolutionary branches where codon-based metrics are unhelpful. if we are to exploit the incontrovertible link between structure and function, however, new structural bioinformatic tools and databases relating protein structure to sequence changes occurring on individual branches are much needed.

this bioinformatic study makes several clear predictions. first, a pcr experiment targeted against the variation between the hypothetical sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> human genes should establish the existence of the two separate genes. second, a reverse transcription-pcr experiment would be expected to uncover transcriptional activity for the sult1a <dig> and sult1a <dig> human genes. since this paper was submitted, these experiments have been done, and indeed confirm our predictions made without the experimental information  <cit> . further, after this manuscript and its computationally-based predictions were submitted for publication, a largely finished sequence for chromosome  <dig> has emerged  <cit>  that confirms our analysis here in every respect.
