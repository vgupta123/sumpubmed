BACKGROUND
antisense oligonucleotides are designed for sequence specific binding of complementary regions on their target mrna. the binding either results in mrna cleavage, caused by the activation of endonucleases rnase h or l
 <cit> , or in the inhibition of translation
 <cit> . different modifications of the nucleic bases or the backbone were introduced to improve their activity and biological stability. in morpholino antisense molecules, the ribose is replaced by morpholino rings and non-ionic phosphorodiamidate is used instead of phosphodiester linkages
 <cit> . their binding strength closely resembles that of rna or dna molecules, therefore, molecules with a length of  <dig> nucleotides are used for efficient transcriptional blockage. for translational blocking the 5’ untranslated region or the region around the start codon of the target mrna are selected
 <cit> . morpholino oligomers can also be used for efficient blocking of the splice machinery
 <cit> . the highly specific effect of morpholino oligomers on gene silencing could be demonstrated in sea urchins
 <cit> , xenopus
 <cit> , zebrafish
 <cit>  and medaka
 <cit> . today morpholino oligos represent the gold standard for gene specific knock down in many species.

in  <dig> nielsen and colleagues created peptide nucleic acids  which instead of the phosphate ribose ring of dna contain a polyamide backbone of n--glycine  units
 <cit> . aegpnas bind to complementary rna or dna in a sequence-specific manner
 <cit> . the chemical structure is responsible for a high stability against proteases, nucleases as well as thermal and ph fluctuations
 <cit> . the entire neutral charge of the molecule decreases the electrostatic repulsion, which results in high hybridization affinity with rna and dna. consequently short probe lengths  are sufficient for selective binding, thereby reducing the probability for forming secondary structures
 <cit> . in addition, the introduction of mismatches has a stronger effect on the stability of pna/dna interactions in comparison to dna/dna duplexes, demonstrating the high specificity of pnas
 <cit> . several in vitro techniques make use of the extraordinary affinity of pnas
 <cit> . in vivo techniques also strongly benefit from the highly specific binding to mrnas, however, so far unmodified aegpnas have not been successful in injection experiments for gene specific knock down in animal models
 <cit> . one problem for the application of pnas is the low solubility due to the absence of charges. introduction of negative charges by forming hetero-oligomers of alternating trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline/phosphonate polyamides with dna bases  allowed specific down regulation of target genes in zebrafish embryos
 <cit> . in addition, various end-modifications of pnas have been developed, which mainly address the improvement of their cell delivery
 <cit> .

here we tested the modification of the pna backbone in order to keep the conformation most similar to the well established original aegpnas. the resulting pepnas contain phosphonic ester side chains in an otherwise non-modified polyamide backbone. the neutral pepnas are highly soluble, but keep the high affinity and specificity of aegpnas. in particular mixed versions of pe- and aegpna components show favourable properties. we demonstrate the efficiency of these new antisense molecules by blocking gfp expression and in vivo down regulation of six <dig> gene function in medaka embryos.

RESULTS
synthesis of novel peptide nucleic acids
aegpnas bind corresponding rna sequences with high affinity and specificity, however, unfavourable properties like their low solubility hamper their application in vivo. by employing the building blocks shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  we introduced phosphonic ester side chains into the otherwise non-modified backbone of aegpnas. as a result novel phosphonic ester pna variants  were obtained .

first we investigated the properties of a 15mer pepna. the oligomer exhibited good solubility in water and we were able to prepare highly concentrated stock solutions . however, it turned out that pepnas capped with acetyl at the c-terminus tend to form stable foam after sonification at this concentration. a possible explanation might be the large number of phosphonic esters residues, which introduce a highly polar but not ionic character into the oligomer. the tendency to form foams was not observed when the pepnas were permanently charged with trimethyl-lysine  at the c-terminus prior to capping with acetyl .

pepnas efficiently block translation of gfp mrna
in order to establish conditions for the application of pepna molecules for antisense approaches we established an assay for translation blocking. cell culture based assays include the problem of the transport of pnas  into the cells
 <cit> . to use an unbiased strategy we therefore used injection into fish embryos. the pepnas were co-injected together with gfp mrna into medaka embryos at the one-cell stage. as target sequence within the gfp mrna we selected a region directly after the aug , which previously had been used for knock down strategies with morpholino oligos
 <cit> . the embryos continued development and  <dig> hours later the gfp signal was observed under the fluorescence microscope. according to the gfp expression level, the embryos were categorized into  <dig> groups with strong, moderate, weak and no gfp signal, respectively . to consider the small variations of the injection procedure, we calculated an overall number of gfp signal intensity for all embryos, which is based on different weights for the individual groups of embryos. for this calculation, strong embryos were weighted with 100%, embryos of the moderate group with 30%, those of the weak group with 10% and those showing no gfp signal were counted with 0%. from this an average number for all embryos was derived and then corrected by those for the injection of mrna alone. the resulting value represents the average gfp intensity in % .
 <dig>  the embryos were injected with a mixture of  <dig> ng/μl gfp mrna and  <dig> μm pnas preincubated for  <dig> minutes on ice. after  <dig> hours the embryos were divided into groups according to their gfp signal intensity. above the columns the calculated average gfp intensity in percent is indicated . similarly the results for mixed pnas are shown in . injections and evaluations were performed as in , except that  <dig> ng/μl mrna were used. note that the increased amount of mrna results in higher numbers of average gfp intensity for comparable antisense function.

we first compared the efficiency of different lengths of the oligomers . the pepnas  were co-injected with  <dig> ng/μl gfp mrna. although all pna lengths were able to reduce the gfp signal in the embryos , the strongest effect was observed for the 16mer pna .

to investigate the influence of the steric hindrance of the phosphonic ester residues, we synthesized a second set of  <dig> and 16mers. in this set an additional methylene group was introduced into the side chain  to elongate the alkyl spacer between the phosphonic esters and the oligomer backbone. furthermore, the number of side chains was reduced, forming a hybrid oligomer of pe- and aegpna components. we hypothesised an increased binding efficiency of these mixed pnas and indeed found a high melting point  for gfp16mix with complementary dna. on the contrary a corresponding pure pepna  showed a considerably lower melting point of  <dig> °c . the presence of the aegpna monomers in the molecules thus increased the binding affinity and this consequently resulted in a stronger reduction of the gfp signal compared to c2-pepnas . we therefore increased the amount of gfp mrna for the co-injection assay to  <dig> ng/μl. this resulted in stronger gfp intensity, which allowed us to better evaluate the improved antisense effect of the mixed pnas. at a concentration of  <dig> μm, a 15mer pna with a mixed backbone  showed a reduction to 59% of the gfp fluorescence intensity. this result could be improved when a 16mer mixed pna  was injected , demonstrating a superior effect of 16mer pnas also for mixed backbones. similar effects were observed for a mixed pna containing  <dig> tml residues . at higher concentrations of  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm the average gfp intensity was reduced to minimum levels of 12%. as a control for the specificity of the pnas, we used a reference pna with a completely unrelated sequence . the gfp level in this control experiment was similar to the group of injected embryos without adding pnas . furthermore, we did not observe any toxicity of the pnas in the fish embryos at higher concentrations .

uniform distribution of pna molecules in medaka embryos
to get more information about the fate of the pnas in the embryos, we injected a sulforhodamine labeled mixed pna variant . after injection at the one-cell stage the pna distributed equally into the dividing blastomeres . a uniform distribution of the pna in the embryo could also be observed at later stages, no signals were detected in the yolk. using this labeled pna we were able to exactly quantify the injection volume and the final concentration of the pnas in the embryo. as a reference we used small beads , which were soaked for several days with a defined concentration of the pna. a comparison of the fluorescence signals of these beads with the injected embryos allowed us to determine the injection volume to  <dig>  nl on average. injection of antisense molecules at  <dig> μm consequently resulted in a concentration of  <dig> μm in the embryonic cells . here uniform distribution within the cells was assumed.

knock down of the six <dig> gene in medaka embryos by mixed pnas
the gfp-pna molecules were tested in an in vivo setting, but the mixing of gfp-antisense pnas with the gfp mrna in the injection solution could lead to pna/rna hybridization prior to injection into the embryos. to avoid this possibility, we decided to test the targeting specificity of the pnas in a complex in vivo environment, with a large excess of non-target mrna. we therefore selected the endogenous six <dig> gene as a target for pna knock down experiments.

six <dig> is part of the six family of proteins, whose members are characterized by the presence of an n-terminal six domain and a homeodomain
 <cit> . six genes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom. in drosophila the six <dig> homologue optix fulfills important functions in the development of the visual system
 <cit> . in vertebrates, six <dig> and six <dig> are expressed in developing areas of the lens, neural retina, retinal-pigmented epithelium, nasal placodes, optic chiasm and forebrain. they take over important tasks in forming the rostral brain and the eye, especially the retina and the lens
 <cit> . the critical function in eye development could also be demonstrated in medaka where inactivation of six <dig> by morpholino knock-down resulted in lack of forebrain and eye structures
 <cit> .

based on the results of the gfp experiments we synthesized a 16mer mixed c3-pna for the knock down experiments . the chosen sequence is a subset of a published morpholino 25mer directed against the six <dig> 5’-region, directly upstream of the start codon
 <cit> . after injection of the six3mix-pna a variety of eye and forebrain phenotypes were observed, in good agreement with previous results obtained for morpholino oligos in medaka embryos
 <cit> . based on the eye and forebrain phenotypes and in agreement with the literature
 <cit>  we divided these embryos into three groups. embryos with a weak phenotype showed a size reduction of the eyes, which at the anterior part pointed towards the midline . embryos with a cyclopic eye phenotype or strongly reduced eye size were characterized as moderate phenotype and embryos with almost no eye and forebrain formation were determined as strong phenotype . the eye and forebrain phenotypes in six3mix-pna injected embryos were then confirmed by analyzing the expression of the winged-helix transcription factor bf <dig>  it has been shown that bf <dig> is essential for forebrain and eye development
 <cit>  and is regulated by six3
 <cit> . as expected the bf <dig> expression was strongly reduced in six3mix-pna injected embryos, especially in those with strong eye and forebrain phenotypes .

the frequency of the obtained phenotypes was dependent on the six3mix-pna concentration. whereas at lower concentrations  only 10% of the surviving embryos showed a weak phenotype, at higher concentrations  up to 95% of the surviving embryos exhibited eye and forebrain phenotypes . a further increase of the pna concentration to  <dig> μm only slightly improved the proportion of strong phenotypes, however, the frequency of mortality increased dramatically  indicating toxic effects of mixed pnas at higher concentrations.

a critical question was how the introduced side chain modifications of the pepna components affected the in vivo knock down efficiency compared to unmodified aegpnas. contrary to negative results reported for unmodified aegpnas in fish embryos
 <cit> , we observed gene specific phenotypes in the injected embryos. however, mixed pnas were more efficient than aegpnas when compared directly . at  <dig> μm, where six3mix-pnas showed six <dig> specific phenotypes in 95% of the surviving embryos, injection of six3-aegpnas resulted in only 54% affected embryos . furthermore, the fraction of strong phenotypes was largely reduced compared to six3mix-pnas . finally, also the toxicity of aegpnas was higher compared to mixed pnas . at higher concentrations  the results for the two pna types was similar, however here the high death rate  indicates already considerable toxicity for both pnas.

to examine the selectivity and the toxicity of the modified pnas, we compared the frequency of the mortality and the obtained eye phenotypes in six3mix-pna injected embryos with two other control groups. first we injected a mixed pna of the same length, but with a completely unrelated sequence . although the frequency of dead embryos slightly increased up to  <dig> μm pna concentration, the surviving embryos did not show any malformations . as a second control experiment to evaluate the selectivity of the antisense function we synthesized a 16mer mixed pna with a single mismatch . although the mutant pna also resulted in six <dig> specific phenotypes, the frequency of embryos with eye and forebrain phenotype was strongly reduced , suggesting that a single point mutation strongly affects the target selection of the mixed pnas. this property offers the possibility to design highly specific antisense molecules that are able to select between individual allelic sequences, differing by single point mutations.

we next compared the six3mix-pnas directly with morpholino oligos, which represent the standard antisense molecules used for gene specific knock down in fish embryos
 <cit> . we used a published target sequence for the medaka six <dig> gene
 <cit> , which overlaps with our pna sequences . we carefully compared the phenotypes at different embryonic stages. morphologically, six3mix-pna injected embryos were not distinguishable from those injected with the morpholino oligo , but they already appeared at lower concentrations compared to the pnas . the appearance of unspecific phenotypes is well established for high concentrations of morpholino oligos
 <cit> . we observed such phenotypes at concentrations of  <dig> μm, which already result in a high mortality rate of 90% . again these unspecific phenotypes were highly similar to those observed for high doses of pnas , suggesting similar unspecific effects of both antisense molecules in the central nervous system and the eyes. for both morpholino oligos and pnas the unspecific phenotypes only appeared at concentrations which already cause high mortality rates . in addition they were clearly distinguishable from the six3-specific phenotypes and also appeared in embryos injected with high amounts of the control pna ref16mix, these embryos however lacked any six <dig> specific phenotypes. to further extend the comparison, we performed a series of in situ hybridisation experiments. no differences were detectable between morpholino and mix-pna injected embryos . therefore, both types of antisense molecules generate the same range of six3-specific phenotypes in medaka embryos and also lead to highly similar unspecific effects at high doses. similar to previous observations
 <cit> , we saw a higher efficiency of morpholino oligos at low concentrations. morpholino oligos show a lower affinity for rna compared to pnas of the same length
 <cit> . our modification of aegpnas into mixed pnas resulted in enhanced knock down efficiency and interestingly, also in reduced affinity . therefore properties different from the affinity must account for the high efficiency of morpholino oligos, however, also the toxicity of these molecules peaks at substantially lower concentrations compared to the mixed pnas .

to further demonstrate the specificity of the six <dig> knock down, we injected a completely unrelated 16mer mix-pna, directed against a sequence downstream of the six <dig> aug . the efficiency of this pna was weak, since no phenotypes were observed at lower concentrations, however at  <dig> μm the expected typical six3-phenotypes appeared . therefore, two independent mixed pnas directed against the six <dig> mrna resulted in the same gene-specific phenotypes, which are indistinguishable from those caused by morpholino oligos. finally we performed a rescue experiment. for this purpose we generated mrna of the human six <dig> gene, which does not contain the targeted sequences of the medaka six <dig>  at higher concentrations , injection of this mrna causes specific phenotypes , we therefore switched to lower concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> ng/μl. in a control experiment co-injection of gfp-mrna with  <dig> μm six3mix-pna resulted in the expected phenotypes . however co-injection of hsix3-mrna strongly reduced the overall number of six3-phenotypes . furthermore, no strong and moderate phenotypes appeared in these embryos any more. therefore, the rescue experiments further demonstrate the specificity of the six <dig> knock down by the mixed pnas.

CONCLUSIONS
pnas are highly efficient antisense molecules, which bind their mrna target sequences with high affinity. however, some properties make their application in vivo difficult. contrary to previous observations
 <cit>  we show here that unmodified aegpnas can be used for the specific knock down of genes in living animals. however, the introduction of phosphonic ester side chains to the backbone improves the properties of the pnas considerably. the increased hydrophilicity resulted in high solubility and the modified pepnas worked efficiently in translational blocking of mrna. the combination with aegpnas in mixed molecules combined the favourable hydrophilic properties of the pepnas with the superior binding affinity of aegpnas. as a result, we could demonstrate an efficient and highly specific knock down of a single medaka gene in vivo.
