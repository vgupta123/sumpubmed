BACKGROUND
early researchers established that functional context is often associated with genome organization when they observed that genes for complex traits are often clustered within a genome  <cit> . by capitalizing upon genomic sequence information and clustering, numerous computational studies have expanded and provided detailed analyses of the association between genomic organization and function . the types of genomic associations with functions include conservation of gene order, gene fusion, shared regulatory elements and co-occurrence of genes   <cit> . of these genomic associations, gene order has been described as the most powerful  <cit> . indeed proximity-based computational methods have been used effectively to associate gene cluster profiles with functionality  <cit> , especially when combined with co-occurrence from phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . such methods are effective because functionally related genes tend to be physically clustered together on the genome and these arrangements tend to be conserved due to selection pressures  <cit> . one of the more powerful characteristics of bacterial genomic organization is the frequent collocation of an operon with the gene for its transcriptional regulator  .

we sought to capitalize upon the physical clustering of genes of related function and the frequent collocation of the tr with its operon to help guide our experimental investigation of tr function. trs allow or repress transcription in response to the presence of an effector molecule that influences their association or dis-association with their target dna operator sequence   <cit> . bacterial transcriptional regulators often respond to small metabolite effector molecules although the identification of effector metabolites to which a given transcriptional regulator responds has been experimentally challenging  <cit> . efforts to identify these metabolite effectors have been most successful by testing metabolites generated by the actions of enzyme  within a specific operon or metabolic pathway . such efforts have tended to ignore similar metabolites or metabolites in related areas of metabolism, however, because of a lack of a suitable method for screening metabolites that can bind transcriptional regulators. these studies have for the most part found only single metabolite effectors  <cit> . homology-based examinations of trs often identify the tr class to which it belongs, but they provide little or no information regarding their specific function. in-vivo experiments that provide candidate effector metabolites can suffer from limitations of solubility, uptake or efflux of the candidate effector metabolite. mutations either knocking out or over expressing the tr can be lethal or generate a global response, making interpretation extremely complex. additional approaches are needed to overcome these limitations and facilitate tr function discovery and characterization.

in our quest to discover the biological activity of tr with unknown function we stumbled onto the right question: how can we systematically predict the metabolic network associated with trs? then we developed a new method for finding and visualizing gene clusters that have the targeted tr as a member and co-occur in a significant number of organisms. in addition to describing the general applicability of our method here, we investigated a burkholderia xenovorans tr, bxe_b <dig>  of unknown function to test the method. bxe_b <dig> is widely conserved among the burkholderia and pseudomonas genus but absent in most other bacteria. sequence homology analysis suggests that it is a member of the tetr-family of trs. the dos for bxe_b <dig> and its orthologs among the burkholderia genus has the general sequence of c agaa gatc ttct c; this sequence is also present in its own promoter region and the promoter regions of an unknown function gene, bxe_b <dig> in b. xenovorans <cit> . we identified the metabolite effector  of this tr and examined the influence of the effector  on the tr binding of its dos. based on gene neighborhoods, we used the functional annotation of the genes in clusters to identify the general metabolic network represented by these clusters to guide the construction of a metabolite library of potential effectors of this tr. in-vitro screening of this library found three metabolites that bound bxe_b <dig>  we examined the interaction of bxe_b <dig> with its dos and the influence of these tr-binding metabolites on the formation and/or collapse of the tr/dos complex. also we investigated the in-vivo effects of these metabolites on the expression of the genes within the operon  .figure  <dig>

RESULTS
approach to the prediction of metabolic function associated with a tr
the goal of our prediction effort was not to find the specific operon or effector molecule associated with a given tr but rather to identify the metabolic area associated with the tr. this metabolic area could be comprised of one or more metabolic pathways. we used the information in the kegg database  <cit>  to analyze and compare gene clustering and genomic organization among a chosen number of organisms containing close homologs of our tr of interest and that were represented in the kegg database to discover functional patterns conserved within the tr’s genomic neighborhood. our experiments suggest that these neighborhoods are usually defined as  <dig> to  <dig> genes upstream and downstream of the tr. this method draws strength from examining all sequenced genomes containing homologs of the desired tr for the clustering of metabolically related genes and their conservation in a cluster . it avoids the typical limitations of methods that require strict conservation of gene order or the definition of non-coding sequence lengths.

function discovery v <dig> , a gene neighborhood analysis tool
function discovery v <dig>  is a java™ based computational tool created to automate the approach to the prediction of metabolic function associated with a tr described above. the additional file  <dig> contains all files required to run the java™ application. function discovery v <dig>  requires as input the three-letter kegg organism code followed by the locus tag of the desired protein, the number of organisms containing close homologs to the protein of interest , the number of genes upstream and downstream genes from the tr will define the size of the genomic neighborhood  and the desired percent of amino acid identity cutoff . our experience has suggested that utilizing between  <dig> and  <dig> genes to define the neighborhood gives the best results. the aa-idc will also limit the number of homologs, for example if  <dig> similar genes and an aa-idc of 40% were selected, there will be cases where only a few genes will satisfy the aa-idc of 40% and the list of homologs will be <  <dig>  we have found that setting the aa-idc < 40% can include trs from the same protein family that are not functional homologs; while setting aa-idc > 40% can filter functional homologs and limit the cross organism correlations. because function discovery v <dig>  performs a series of online database searches and re-arranges the information for easier analysis, the input of a large genomic neighborhood, a large number of homologs or a low aa-idc, significantly lengthens the run time. the results are shown in a report that contains the gene information from the kegg database and several tables summarizing the results of the search . the first table, homolog id, shows the number of entries in the kegg database that satisfy both the organisms containing close homologs to the query tr and aa-idc. the second set of tables, called neighborhood representations, presents the genomic neighborhoods for each of the genes in the homolog id table. next, the over-represented enzyme summary table gathers information on all known function proteins in the genomic neighborhoods determined by the neighborhood representation tables and ranks them by the frequency of occurrence. this is followed by the over-represented metabolite summary table, which recollects the metabolites identified as substrates or products of the proteins included in the over-represented enzyme summary and ranks them by frequency of occurrence. finally, the over-represented pathway summary merges the information in the previous tables to identify kegg metabolic pathways containing the proteins and metabolites and ranks them by the highest number of hits per pathway. the higher the ranking of a metabolic pathway in the over-represented pathway summary, the more likely it is that the tr acts as a regulator for part or the entire metabolic pathway. the report file created by function discovery v <dig>  is a htlm file. all the tables have hyperlinks that allow the user to access the information in the kegg database.

function discovery v <dig>  validation
to validate the approach to the prediction of metabolic function associated with a tr, we analyzed ten transcriptional regulators with known functions and effectors utilizing our software named function discovery v <dig> . in regard to these ten known trs, our software was able to identify the metabolic pathway or genes regulated by each tr . figure  <dig> presents the graphic user interface  for function discovery v <dig>  showing the parameters used for the validation test runs. for nine trs, including beti   <cit> , catr   <cit> , cynr   <cit> , cysb   <cit> , glpr   <cit> , hpar   <cit> , kynr   <cit> , hutc   <cit>  and rcom   <cit> , the pathways known to be regulated by the trs were identified in the first hit in the over-represented pathway summary ; in each case the tr effector molecules are metabolic intermediates in the pathway they regulate. the exception was mode which required a closer analysis of the function discovery v <dig>  report . mode   <cit>  is involved in the regulation of the molybdate transport pump system which is encoded by the operon modabcde. by observing the known genes and conservation patterns in the genomic neighborhoods , we could easily identify most of the genes in the operon encoding for the molybdate transport system . however, only one of the proteins involved in this system has been assigned an ec number, modc , which was identified in the genome neighborhood with the highest frequency , unfortunately none of the other components of the transport system have been assign ec numbers. in addition, modc is not associated with any pathway in the kegg database, which makes it impossible for the function discovery v <dig>  software to make a pathway prediction in the over-represented pathway summary. this problem is expected to be greater for operons encoding for efflux and transport systems because the genes associated with them rarely have assigned ec numbers and when they do, they may not be associated with any pathway in the kegg database. in these cases a more detailed analysis of the function discovery v <dig>  results file is necessary. despite this limitation, the function discovery v <dig>  software has shown a remarkable ability to gather the information necessary to associate trs with their metabolic pathway.table  <dig>

prediction of metabolic function associated with trs: the case of bxe_b3018
the gene encoding for our target tr of unknown function, bxe_b <dig> is present in the genome of b. xenovorans. amino acid sequence comparisons using a blast search of bxe_b <dig> with the entire set of completely and partially sequenced microbial genomes  identified the existence of  <dig> homologs . these homologs were found only in burkholderia or pseudomonas genomes.

utilizing function discovery v <dig> , we performed a careful examination of the genomic neighborhood of bxe_b <dig>  and its homologs . the examination revealed that, in nearly every instance, these genes were found in close proximity to a cluster of genes involved in the degradation of glycine, threonine and serine; these degradation products provide substrates for the pyruvate metabolism pathway. specifically, the genes for glycine c-acetyltransferase , l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase  and homoserine kinase  are in close proximity to either bxe_b <dig> or its homologs. the physical locations of other genes  involved in the degradation of glycine, threonine and serine metabolism were less well conserved but were present in relatively close proximity to bxe_b <dig> and its homologs. our function discovery  <dig>  analysis tool identified the glycine, threonine and serine degradation pathway as the top candidate  and provided hyperlinks that allow the visualization of the identified proteins  and metabolites  in a pathway map .figure  <dig>

high-throughput screening of possible effectors of bxe_b3018: fac-ms experiments
the predicted association of the degradation of glycine, threonine and serine and subsequent pyruvate metabolism with bxe_b <dig> allowed us to assemble a library of candidate effector metabolites from these metabolic pathways . these metabolites were screened for binding to immobilized bxe_b <dig> using frontal affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry  detection of metabolites eluting from the column . this method allowed for direct identification and ranking of metabolites based on their relative binding strengths because the order of elution of these compounds suggests their relative strengths of binding to the effector binding site on gst-bxe_b <dig>  the ranking obtained from screening the library of compounds identified aminopropan-2-ol, n,n-dimethylaminoacetone and aminoacetone as potential effectors for bxe_b <dig>  in addition to these compounds, the assembled library also contained methylglyoxal, a compound not readily detectable by our mass spectrometry method. for this reason, its potential interaction with bxe_b <dig> was examined using another method as described below.figure  <dig>

impact of potential effector metabolites on the formation and/or collapse of the tr/dos complex: anisotropy experiments
gst-bxe-b <dig> binds its dos to form a tr/dos complex in the absence of an effector molecule with a kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm as estimated by fluorescence polarization  experiments. we also used this method to examine the effects of the potential effector molecules  on the affinity of gst-bxe_b <dig> to its dos. we found that the presence of aminoacetone, n,n-dimethylaminoacetone and methylglyoxal caused the collapse of the tr/dos complex. the kd values for aminoacetone, n,n-dimethylaminoacetone and methylglyoxal were  mm,  mm and  mm, respectively. the anisotropy experiments were not able to detect any significant disruption of the tr/dos complex when aminopropan-2-ol was used as an effector molecule. other structurally related molecules, such as acetamide, propionamide and the most weakly bound glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  did not affect the tr/dos complex. we could therefore surmise that these compounds were not acting as effectors in these experiments. dissociation constants in the presence of candidate effectors were calculated at a saturation concentration of gst-bxe_b <dig>  where all dos  was bound. because aminopropan-2-ol was among the most strongly bound compounds when assayed by fac-ms, we wondered if it would impact the decrease in bxe_b <dig> binding to its dos in the presence of aminoacetone, n,n-dimethylaminoacetone or methylglyoxal. aminopropan-2-ol did not significantly affect the affinity of gst-bxe_b <dig> to its dos when aminoacetone , n,n-dimethylaminoacetone  or methylglyoxal  were added to the reaction mixture without previous pre-incubation; we therefore concluded that aminopropan-2-ol was not interfering with the binding of these other compounds in our assay.

impact of compounds bound by tr on its dos association: emsa assays
results from electrophoresis mobility shift assays were consistent with the observations obtained from the anisotropy experiments for aminoacetone , methylglyoxal  and aminopropna-2-ol  . the third compound that disrupted tr/dos complex formation, dimethylaminoacetone, was not examined here because it is not a metabolite and therefore not a naturally occurring effector. as shown in figure  <dig>  lane  <dig> contained unbound dos as a control and lane  <dig> contained the dos/tr complex control. when the potential effector molecules  were mixed with bxe_b <dig> and the dos, the formation of the dos/tr complex was disrupted . as the concentration of aa and mgx effectors increased, there was an increase dos/tr disruption, leading to an increase in unbound dos. when aminopropan-2-ol was used as the effector, there was no disruption of the dos/tr complex .figure  <dig>

effects of potential effectors on gene expression: real-time pcr
real-time pcr experiments were utilized to determine whether the in-vitro-identified effector molecules  as well as the non-effector  were capable of affecting the expression of the genes in the operon . bxe_b <dig> binds its dos in the absence of an effector molecule; incubation of b. xenovorans with the effector molecules should cause bxe_b <dig> to release its dos increasing the rate of translation of the genes encoding bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig> and bxe_b <dig>  aminoacetone and aminopropan-2-ol showed no effect on the expression of the regulated genes with concentrations up to 10 mm of each effector. addition of 10 mm of methylglyoxal and incubation for an hour led to a 40-fold increase in the expression of the regulated genes  and a 100-fold increase in the expression of the tr , of as measured by real-time pcr .these in-vivo results suggest that methylglyoxal was the only effector molecule able to increase translation of the genes in the operon.

discussion
as early as the 1930’s, geneticists observed that genes encoding for proteins responsible for complex traits are often clustered within the genome  <cit> . computational approaches have estimated that an average of 58% of bacterial genes are found in operons  <cit> . proximity-based computational methods have been used effectively to associate gene cluster profiles with functionality  <cit> , although this approach is confounded by insertions, deletions or changes in gene order  <cit> . to overcome these complications, we developed an automated gene/genomic region analysis tool that rapidly identifies, compares and presents conserved genomic neighborhoods encoding for metabolic pathways across many organisms. our gene neighborhood examination tool, function discovery v <dig> , allows us to find collocations in genomic neighborhoods across many organisms, associating metabolic pathways with the target tr. it does not restrict our investigation to a single organism in which gene clustering around the target tr might not have existed because of rearrangements, insertions or deletions of genetic material or other events. recently, we reported the characterization of three trs of unknown function in which we used a manual version of our approach to predict functionality and identify potential effector metabolites  <cit> . our automated approach, function discovery v <dig>  has also been effective in finding conserved genes clustered near our target genes and for ten randomly chosen trs that have known effectors and functions . of course, the ability to gain functional insights using our method is limited by the extent to which the genes clustered near a target gene have been functionally annotated.

in this work, we investigated a b. xenovorans tr of unknown function, bxe_b <dig>  it is widely conserved among the burkholderia and pseudomonas genus but absent in most other bacteria. there are more than  <dig> trs common among the members of the burkholderia genus that have not been fully functionally annotated. characterization of these trs is vital to the understanding of the metabolism of this genus, which is characterized by having members with excellent environmental adaptability and/or high pathogenicity. function discovery v <dig>  analysis suggested that bxe_b <dig> may be involved in the glycine, serine and threonine degradation pathway. the operon regulated by bxe_b <dig> is found upstream from several genes involved in this metabolism. our software analysis coupled with our in-vitro and in-vivo experiments suggests that it responds to a metabolite from the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathway, methylglyoxal. fluorescence anisotropy experiments suggest that bxe_b <dig> binds methylglyoxal with a dissociation constant of ~2 mm. millimolar concentrations of methylglyoxal in bacterial cells have been previously reported  <cit> . the bxe_b3018-regulated operon includes the genes bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig> and bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig> is a hypothetical protein that shows some sequence similarity to sn-glycerol-3-phosphate transporters . glpt is a transporter involved in antibiotic resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . bxe_b <dig> encodes a protein of unknown function belonging to the 50s ribosomal protein l <dig> family. 50s is the larger subunit of the 70s ribosome of prokaryotes and the site of inhibition of macrolides  <cit>  and the pleuromutilins  <cit>  antibiotics. bxe_b <dig> is a member of the ycei family of transport proteins, a widely conserved protein commonly involved in antimicrobial resistance mechanisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on its response to methylglyoxal, we propose the bxe_b <dig> be given functional name mgxr. the potential relationship between the functions encoded by the mgxr-regulated operon genes and serine, glycine and threonine degradation may be revealed by consideration of the effector methylglyoxal. it is a side product of both glycine degradation and glycolysis and is the major electrophile produced intracellularly by bacterial cells  <cit> . methylglyoxal is a highly reactive  <dig> -dicarbonylic compound that reacts readily with amino groups, causing structural changes in proteins and dna and generating free radicals in the process  <cit> . as is to be expected for such a deleterious compound, there are several paths known for detoxification of methylglyoxal. the sulphydryl group of glutathione can react spontaneously with methylglyoxal, followed by the actions of the glyoxalase i and glyoxalase ii enzymes, thus producing d-lactate, which can be either excreted or recycled to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase  <cit> . alternatively, bacteria can utilize the kefb/kefc potassium pump system to acidify the cytoplasm and inactivate the methylglyoxal  <cit> . our findings suggest that b. xenovorans may have another detoxification mechanism, a methylglyoxal efflux system encoded by the mgxr regulated operon. further characterization of this putative efflux system encoded by the bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig>  bxe_b <dig> and bxe_b <dig> operon is required.
