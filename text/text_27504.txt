BACKGROUND
hand <dig> is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed in the developing heart, neural crest derivates and autonomic nervous system including sympathetic neurons, adrenal chromaffin cells and enteric neurons  <cit> . hand <dig> plays a key role in the development and differentiation of the sympathetic nervous system by promoting differentiation of neural crest derived precursors into catecholaminergic neurons and maintaining the neural precursor pool of cells  <cit> . functional analyses showed that hand <dig> belongs to the group of bmp induced transcription factors that acts downstream of phox2b and upstream of gata <dig>  gata <dig>  phox2a and the noradrenergic marker genes tyrosine hydroxylase  and dopamine beta hydroxylase   <cit> . in addition, hand <dig> is highly expressed in neuroblastoma , a pediatric tumor arising from undifferentiated migrating sympathetic precursor cells that shows conspicuously divergent biological phenotypes ranging from spontaneous regression to rapid progression and metastasis  <cit> .

recently, we have reported on the identification of dein, a novel gene with high expression in nb of children < <dig> year of age and stage 4s nb, both of which are associated with a good prognosis and spontaneous regression  <cit> . given the lack of a putative coding region, dein was predicted to represent a noncoding rna whose function in nb and sympathetic nervous system development is yet unclear. dein is located on chromosome 4q33– <dig> in a head-to-head orientation with hand <dig> with both genes being separated by a nucleotide sequence of  <dig> bp. the close vicinity and divergent configuration of both genes together with their concurrent tissue specific expression pattern suggests a common transcriptional regulation that is mediated by the intergenic sequence. bidirectional gene organisation was shown to represent a common feature in the human genome with approximately 10% of all genes showing this configuration. many of these gene pairs were shown to be co-regulated and/or functionally related  <cit> .

this study aimed to examine the potential of the intergenic region to direct transcription in hand <dig> and dein orientation, thereby acting as a bidirectional promoter. in addition, conservation and structural features such as putative transcription factor binding sites  of the genomic region were analyzed. to test whether the expression of both genes is co-regulated in nb in vivo and associated with prognostic factors, expression levels of dein and hand <dig> were examined in a cohort of  <dig> primary nbs of different stages by microarray analysis.

RESULTS
determination of transcriptional start sites and the nucleotide structures of hand <dig> and dein transcripts in nb
the human hand <dig> gene was initially cloned from a human fetal cardiac cdna library by russel et al.  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb long consensus sequence derived from cdna clones af <dig> and af <dig> was shorter than the  <dig>  kb transcript detected in northern blot, and the authors expected the unaccounted sequence to be located in the 3'-utr of the gene. however, numerous transcribed sequences containing the coding region of hand <dig> and extending several  <dig> bp in 5'-direction have been submitted to genbank in recent years suggesting that the unaccounted sequence is most probably located upstream of the coding region. in order to determine the transcriptional start site and the full length sequence of the main hand <dig> transcript in nb, we performed a combined race- and rt-pcr approach. the resulting transcript is  <dig> bp long and comprises two exons of  <dig> and  <dig> bp . the 5'-sequence of the first exon extends into a cpg island with an average gc-content of 70% which might have impeded the full-length cloning of the human transcript in previous attempts. our results are well in line with the reported length of  <dig>  kb by northern blot hybridization from heart tissue  <cit>  and our northern blot analyses. the genomic structure of hand <dig> with a long first and a shorter second exon with the coding region being interrupted by an intron is highly conserved in other species such as mouse, rat, chicken and zebrafish . furthermore, the transcriptional start site of hand <dig> is highly conserved in all of these species. the 5'-end of fj <dig> is identical with the start sites of mrna ak <dig> and est da <dig>  both of which were derived from nb cell line imr- <dig>  in contrast, the hand <dig> reference sequence nm_ <dig>  which has not been experimentally confirmed, lacks two nucleotides at its 5'-end as compared to our transcript. the cloning procedures and the nucleotide structures of the dein transcript variants have been described in detail previously  <cit> .

quantitative expression of hand <dig> and dein in primary nb
to determine whether expression of hand <dig> and dein is co-regulated in neuroblastoma, we performed northern blot analysis of  <dig> primary nb with hand2- and dein-specific cdna probes. we detected strong expression of both genes in all stage 4s tumors, moderate to low expression in localized tumors, and little or no expression in stage  <dig> tumors . in nb cell lines, expression of dein and hand <dig> was detected in cell lines sh-sy5y and kelly, but it was absent in cell line sh-ep. the concurrent transcript levels of hand <dig> and dein in primary nb and nb cell lines indicated a co-regulated expression of both genes in nb.

to validate these results, expression of dein and hand <dig> was analyzed in a set of  <dig> primary nb samples by microarray analysis . patients diagnosed before the age of one year had significantly higher dein and hand <dig> expression values as compared to patients diagnosed later . expression of both genes was also significantly higher in children diagnosed before the age of  <dig> months as compared to older patients . as expected, dein expression was significantly higher in tumors of stage 4s than in those of stage  <dig> . these results are in line with our previous study that reported on a strong association between dein expression and stage 4s as well as age <  <dig> year in a cohort of  <dig> primary nbs by real-time rt-pcr  <cit> . however, in contrast to the results of our previous study  <cit> , dein expression was neither significantly different between stage  <dig> and localized stages, nor between stage 4s and localized stages in the micoarray analyses . this discrepancy might be explained by the high percentage of patients < <dig> months of age among localized tumors in the microarray cohort . hand <dig> mrna levels were not associated with either stage, which is in agreement with a study of gestbloom et al., who reported that hand <dig> is expressed independently of tumor stage or differentiation in nb  <cit> . nevertheless, hand <dig> and dein expression values were well correlated in our study . together, these findings support the hypothesis that expression of hand <dig> and dein is co-regulated in primary nb.

characterization of the putative bidirectional promoter sequence between hand <dig> and dein
the putative promoter between hand <dig> and dein is located within a cpg island  that extends into the first exon of hand <dig> . the intergenic region shows high evolutionary conservation with  <dig>   <dig> and 53% nucleotide identity of the human sequence in comparison to mouse, chicken and zebrafish, respectively. the high degree of homology is comparable to that of the coding region of hand <dig> which shows  <dig>   <dig> and 68% identity of the human sequence in comparison to mouse, chicken and zebrafish, respectively.

no tata-box, but various other highly conserved potential transcription regulatory elements were found in the bidirectional promoter . these include two gc-boxes with sp- <dig> sites and one ap- <dig> site in dein-orientation as well as one ap- <dig> site in hand2-orientation. four binding sites for zinc finger transcription factors gata- <dig> or - <dig>  were detected. we also found four binding sites for homeobox transcription factors including three binding sites for cdxa , and one binding site each for abd-b and prx <dig> in hand <dig> orientation. finally, a highly conserved site for camp response element-binding protein  in both orientations and a highly conserved centrally located ccaat box in hand <dig> orientation were detected. evolutionary conservation was found for the cdxa, creb and the ccaat binding sites in all vertebrate species investigated, while sp <dig>  ap <dig> and  <dig>  abd-b and gata binding sites were only conserved in mouse and/or chicken.

asymmetrical activity of the bidirectional promoter between dein and hand2
to test the ability of the putative bidirectional promoter to activate transcription in dein and hand <dig> orientation, it was cloned separately or together with two other highly conserved putative regulatory elements in both orientations into a luciferase reporter vector. a total of six reporter gene constructs were transfected into four neuroblastoma cell lines . it was demonstrated that the bidirectional promoter is able to drive expression in both hand <dig> and dein direction in all cell lines with ~ <dig> fold higher activity in hand <dig> orientation than in dein orientation. in dein orientation the promoter caused a  <dig>  –  <dig> fold activation  as compared to the promoterless vector . a  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold increase in activity  was detected for the promoter in hand <dig> orientation in all cell lines as compared to the promoterless vector .

to test whether promoter activity is influenced by either of two other highly conserved sequence fragments that are located within the genomic sequence covered by dein, we cloned these elements either upstream or downstream of the luciferase gene in the respective orientations relative to the bidirectional promoter according to their actual genomic position . the presence of a  <dig> bp long regulatory element that was shown to act as enhancer for hand <dig> expression in branchial arches  <cit>  decreased luciferase activity in both dein and hand <dig> orientations. for construct c, an average  <dig>  fold reduction in activity was detected as compared to construct a . for construct f, an average  <dig>  fold reduction in activity was detected as compared to construct d .

another highly conserved sequence element of  <dig> bp located in exon  <dig> of dein, which has been suggested to represent a cis-regulatory element for dein and/or hand <dig> expression  <cit> , also exerted weak repressor activity on both promoters. for construct b, we detected an average  <dig>  fold reduction in activity as compared to construct a . for construct e, we detected an average  <dig>  fold reduction as compared to construct d .

discussion
in this study, we report on the molecular characterization of a highly conserved intergenic nucleotide sequence between hand <dig> and dein which functions as a bidirectional promoter. bidirectional gene configuration, defined as two divergently transcribed genes that are separated by less than  <dig> kb, is a common architectural feature in the human genome and was shown to account for co-regulated and/or tissue specific expression of functionally related genes  <cit> . most of these genes have been reported to belong to the group of housekeeping genes many of which are involved in dna repair and replication  <cit> . in recent years, other non-homologous bidirectional gene pairs were identified with functions in senescence  <cit> , antigen presentation  <cit> , brain disease  <cit> , oncogenesis or tumor supression  <cit> .

structure and conservation of the bidirectional promoter
the majority of bidirectional promoters are less than  <dig> bp in length, have a median gc-content of 66% and associate with cpg-islands in 75%  <cit> . all these features are present in the common promoter region of hand <dig> and dein, which is  <dig> bp long, contains  <dig> cpg sites and has a gc-content of 70%. interestingly, the distance between hand <dig> and dein remained stable throughout evolution with only  <dig> and  <dig> additional nucleotides in the human sequence as compared to chicken and mouse, respectively. although there is no systematic evaluation on the alteration of the genomic distance between bidirectional gene pairs throughout evolution, we found examples reporting a far more dramatic increase of several hundreds of bp  <cit> . the constancy of the intergenic distance between hand <dig> and dein might thus be indicative of the selective pressure that was acting to maintain the close distance of the genes over a long evolutionary period.

the nucleotide sequence, exon number and transcript structure including intron-exon boundaries of hand <dig> are highly conserved among different species including chicken and zebrafish. in contrast, dein is only conserved in mouse and chicken but not zebrafish, and shows an overall lower conservation that decreases in 3'-direction with the highest conservation in exons  <dig> and  <dig> and a region in exon  <dig>  <cit> . numerous transcribed sequences matching nearly all exons of dein were found in mouse and chicken, but not in zebrafish. tissue sources for these sequences included typical hand <dig> expressing tissues such as heart, and embryonic or fetal tissues such as trophoblast and developing sympathetic ganglia, respectively  <cit> . we conclude from these findings that  dein has probably first evolved after zebrafish in higher vertebrates, and that  bidirectional transcription of hand <dig> and dein is probably evolutionary conserved in higher vertebrates such as rodents and birds. the latter conclusion is further supported by large-scale comparative analyses of bidirectional promoters in vertebrates using orthology assignments, according to which many bidirectional promoters have emerged after the divergence of birds and fish  <cit> .

asymmetrical activity of the bidirectional promoter in nb cell lines
the activity of the bidirectional promoter in four nb cell lines was shown to be asymmetric with strong activity in hand <dig> and moderate activity in dein orientation. asymmetric activity has been reported previously for other divergently transcribed gene pairs  <cit> .

the comparatively low activity of the promoter in dein orientation is surprising regarding the strong expression of dein in primary nb as indicated by sage, northern blot and rt-pcr analysis . dein expression might possibly require additional cis-regulatory elements that were not included in our constructs. alternatively, activation of the promoter in dein orientation could also depend on transcriptional activators absent in nb cell lines, which are derived from rapidly progressing tumors characterized by rather low dein mrna levels  <cit> . transcript levels of both genes might also be further modified by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mrna modification or degradation.

two other highly conserved sequence elements, one of which was shown to function as an enhancer for hand <dig> transcription in branchial arches  <cit> , appear to act as weak repressors for both dein and hand <dig> transcription in nb. however, the in vitro repressive activity could also be a result of steric inhibition of transcription factors, since the genetic distance between the two regulatory elements and the promoter in the genome is about  <dig> –  <dig> kb, whereas it is only  <dig> bp –  <dig>  kb in the luciferase reporter constructs.

transcriptional regulation and putative functional link of hand <dig> and dein in nb
tissue specific regulation of hand <dig> expression by cis-regulatory elements located in its upstream genomic region has been extensively studied in heart and branchial arches, but to date, genomic elements that are critical for hand <dig> expression in the developing sympathetic nervous system have not been identified. in heart, hand <dig> transcription depends on an enhancer element consisting of two conserved gata sites that are dispersed over a genomic region of  <dig>  kb between exon  <dig> and  <dig> of dein with an overall low conservation  <cit> . in branchial arches, hand <dig> expression depends on endothelin-signaling via dlx <dig> which binds to a highly conserved  <dig> bp long enhancer element located between exon  <dig> and  <dig> of dein  <cit> . according to mcfadden et al. who studied regulatory elements for hand <dig> expression in mouse, the genomic region  <dig> kb upstream of hand <dig> did not direct expression in sympathetic ganglia  <cit> . this result seems to be in contrast with our finding of a strong transcriptional activation of a reporter gene by the  <dig> bp upstream region of hand <dig> in human nb cells that are suggested to derive from sympathicoadrenal precursors.

our data indicate that the bidirectional promoter is an important element for hand <dig> expression in sympathicoadrenal tissues, although the exact transcriptional activators have not been specified yet. it has been demonstrated earlier that phox2b knockout mice lack hand <dig> expression  <cit> . these data strongly suggest that phox2b, a master gene required for the development and differentiation of autonomic neurons  <cit> , is an upstream activator of hand <dig> in the developing sympathetic nervous system  <cit> . expression analyses of phox2b, hand <dig> and dein in nb cells lines sh-sy5y and sh-ep, two well-studied subclones of sk-n-sh with a neuronal-like and epithelial-like phenotype, respectively  <cit> , further suggest that not only hand <dig>  but also dein is a target gene of phox2b: in cell line sh-ep, phox2b expression was shown to be absent  <cit> , and likewise, neither hand <dig> nor dein was expressed in sh-ep cells according to our northern blot analysis ; in contrast, all three genes are expressed in cell line sh-sy5y . in order to investigate whether dein and hand <dig> are possible downstream targets of phox2b in primary nb, we simultaneously examined dein and hand <dig> mrna levels in sixty selected tumors with high and low phox2b expression values using microarrays . tumors of both subgroups showed largely concordant expression levels of dein and hand <dig>  however, whereas low expression levels of phox2b were consistently associated with low mrna levels of dein and hand <dig> in the vast majority of cases, the degree of correlation appeared to be lower for tumors with high phox2b expression levels. these observations provide further evidence that phox2b may act as an upstream activator of both dein and hand <dig>  although additional factors may be necessary to induce expression of these genes in nb. taking the presence of multiple conserved binding sites for homeobox transcription factors within the bidirectional promoter and the concurrent expression of hand <dig> and dein in nb into account, it is tempting to speculate that phox2b could actually represent a direct transcriptional activator for hand <dig> and dein via the common promoter sequence.

the known phox2b downstream targets hand <dig> and phox2a were shown to promote differentiation of sympathicoadrenal cells and expression of noradrenergic marker genes. in nb cell lines, forced over-expression of wild-type phox2b was shown to suppress cell proliferation and promote differentiation  <cit> . as another hypothetical phox2b target gene, dein might be involved in these cellular processes. this is particularly interesting in the light of the strong dein expression in tumors of stage 4s and those of children diagnosed < <dig> year of age. since these tumors are associated with a good prognosis and often follow spontaneous regression, they have been speculated to represent embryonal remnants rather than malignant tumors  <cit> .

bidirectional gene pairs have been shown to be functionally related, e.g. in dna repair  <cit> , senescence  <cit>  or brain disease  <cit> . the concurrent quantitative and tissue specific expression of both genes  suggests that hand <dig> and dein are regulated by common transcriptional mechanisms in a restricted range of tissues during early developmental stages. the bidirectional promoter probably plays an important role in coordinating hand <dig> and dein expression in a similar spatial and temporal fashion. however, the functional relevance of the linkage between dein and hand <dig> expression by the bidirectional promoter requires further investigation, e.g. functional studies on dein and experiments elucidating the transcription factors that bind to the promoter region.

CONCLUSIONS
hand <dig> and dein represent a gene pair that is tightly linked by a bidirectional promoter in an evolutionary highly conserved manner. the activity of the promoter in nb cell lines is asymmetric with strong activity in hand <dig> and moderate activity in dein orientation. expression studies strongly suggest co-regulation of both genes, and their high expression in tissues corresponding to the developing sympathetic nervous system suggests a functional link between hand <dig> and dein. co-regulated and tissue specific expression are likely both mediated by the bidirectional promoter, which appears to be evolutionary highly conserved in rodents and birds. concordant expression levels of hand <dig>  dein and phox2b in many primary nb and nb cell lines suggest that phox2b acts as an upstream transcriptional activator for both genes. regarding the key role of hand <dig> in the differentiation of neural crest derived precursors into sympathetic neurons and the high expression of dein in spontaneously regressing nb, dein could be instrumental in biological phenomena like regression and differentiation, which are characteristic for favourable nb and the developing sympathetic nervous system.
