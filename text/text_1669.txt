BACKGROUND
baculoviruses  are rod-shaped, enveloped, insect-specific viruses with double-stranded, circular dna genomes ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb  <cit> . the family baculoviridae is subdivided into four genera: alphabaculovirus , betabaculovirus , gammabaculovirus  and deltabaculovirus   <cit> . gvs have been isolated only from insects belonging to the order lepidoptera and are classified in three groups according to the pathology caused in their insect hosts. type  <dig> pathology is characterized by an infection limited to the host’s midgut and fat body resulting in a relatively slow speed of kill. type  <dig> pathology is characterized by infection of most of the host’s tissues and a rapid speed of kill. there is a third pathology with a single representative, the harrisina brillians granulovirus, that causes an infection constrained to the midgut epithelium that results in the rapid death of the host  <cit> .

a highly pathogenic granulovirus was isolated from a larva of the “bean shoot borer” epinotia aporema , one of the major soybean pests in argentina, and characterized at biological and molecular levels  <cit> . further characterization of its pathology demonstrated that this virus belongs to the type  <dig> gvs meaning that the infection caused by epapgv in its host is polyorganotropic  <cit> . all this information has been instrumental to formally propose its use as a microbial control agent with great potential. in order to contribute to a more thorough characterization of epapgv we set out to determine and analyze its complete genome sequence.

to date, close to  <dig> baculovirus genomes have been fully sequenced,  <dig> of them belong to the betabaculovirus genus. completely sequenced gvs are listed in table  <dig> and their pathology types are indicated. in this report, we present the complete sequence and organization of the epapgv genome and compare them to other baculoviruses using genomic and phylogenetic analyses.

when information is available, gv type pathology is indicated. nr: not reported.  the genome of clostera anachoreta gv was published  <cit>  after the present work was completed; it was not included in this analysis.

RESULTS
general characteristics of the epapgv genome
the complete epapgv genome  was covered  <dig> times by  <dig> sequencing. it consists of  <dig>  bp in good agreement with the previous estimate of  <dig>  kbp based on restriction mapping  <cit> . betabaculoviruses have at-rich genomes ranging between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . the at content of epapgv genome is  <dig> %. however, no correlation between these data and biological properties has been found thus far. analysis of the epapgv genome sequence led to the identification of  <dig> putative protein coding genes. the search was restricted to open reading frames starting with a methionine codon, coding for polypeptides of at least  <dig> amino acid residues  and minimal overlapping of adjacent orfs. this information comprises  <dig> % of the nucleotide sequence . the adenine of the granulin start codon was designated nucleotide  <dig> and the sequence was numbered in the direction of granulin gene transcription, which defined the clockwise orientation of the circular genome map  <cit> . the putative orfs were numbered sequentially in this orientation. seventy-two orfs were in the same orientation as the granulin orf, and sixty-one, in the opposite. epapgv dna sequence was searched for promoter motifs  <dig> bp upstream of the starting codon of each orf. early promoter motifs including tata box  in conjunction with cakt initiator sequence   <cit>  were found in the upstream regions of  <dig> orfs;  <dig> orfs had a late inr motif dtaag  <cit>  and  <dig> orfs had both early and late elements.

gene content
the epapgv genome contains the  <dig> core genes present in all baculoviruses. the genes were also classified according to their presence in different genera  <cit>  .

a distinct feature of the epapgv genome is that the core gene alkaline nuclease  is fused in frame with the helicase- <dig> orf . this fusion gene codes for an  <dig> aa polypeptide with the first  <dig> residues homologous to alk-exo and the last  <dig> to helicase- <dig>  a  <dig> aa-long intervening polypeptide of unknown origin and without significant sequence similarity to any protein in genbank was found between the alk-exo and the helicase- <dig> regions. the intervening polypeptide may act as a low-structure linker between alk-exo and helicase- <dig> such that both enzyme domains could fold as if they were independent polypeptides retaining their respective functions . although this region was confirmed by resequencing, it will be important to study this genomic region in alternative isolates of epapgv and determine the transcription and translation products in infected larvae. all gvs contain these two genes in the same order, but there are no reports of a fusion. fusion genes seem to be extremely rare in baculovirus genomes, but there is one report of fused genes encoded by spodoptera litura npv: the ubiquitin orf is fused in frame with gp <dig> and the fusion protein is proteolytically processed  <cit> .

for two epapgv orfs  the blastp search found homologues in only one member of the baculoviridae. epap <dig> is preceded by early and late promoter motifs and codes for a  <dig> aa protein that shares 34% amino acid identity with a  <dig> aa protein encoded by eppo <dig> of epiphyas postvittana npv. this orf was reported to be unique to epponpv and has an early promoter motif  <cit> . epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa protein that matched a  <dig> aa protein of spodoptera litura gv  with 38% sequence identity according to clustalw alignment.

orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to have homologues in alphabaculovirus genomes but not in other betabaculoviruses. epap <dig> is a  <dig> aa long protein that seemed to be homologous to spodopera exigua mnpv orf  <dig> by blastp search  although they have very low amino acid identity . epap <dig>  and epap <dig>  are both similar to orf  <dig> of adoxophyes honmai npv  and orf  <dig> of adoxophyes orana npv . epap <dig> shares 32% identity with the n-terminal portion of adornpv orf  <dig> and epap <dig> is homologous to the c-terminal region of orf  <dig> of adornpv  and adhonpv . gv homologues of epap <dig> and epap <dig> were found only in agsegv . epap <dig> is similar to ac <dig> of autographa californica mnpv ; their predicted proteins are 28% identical. its homologue in bombyx mori npv , bm <dig>  was reported to be a structural gene associated with the budded virus  envelope  <cit> , but its deletion resulted in a virus with a phenotype similar to the wild type indicating that it might be a nonessential gene  <cit> .

epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa long protein that is highly similar to orf  <dig> of cryptophlebia leucotreta gv  according to blastp search . crle <dig> is a  <dig> aa predicted protein reported to be similar to se <dig>  <cit> . these proteins share a protein motif of the duf <dig> superfamily. they have homologues in all alphabaculoviruses  <cit>  and studies conducted with a deletion mutant of the homologue in acmnpv  indicated that it is not essential for viral replication both in vitro and in vivo, but it may play a role in efficient virus infection in trichoplusia ni larvae  <cit> . homologues of epap24/crle <dig> were not found in the rest of the granuloviruses.

transcription genes
epapgv dna codes for the rna polymerase subunits lef- <dig> , lef- <dig> , lef- <dig>  and p <dig> , lef- <dig>  and vlf- <dig> , present in all baculoviruses. additional genes related to the transcription process found in all lepidopteran baculovirus were also detected in the epapgv genome:  <dig> k/pp <dig> , lef- <dig> , lef- <dig>   and pk- <dig> . lef- <dig>  involved in late transcription and present in most alpha- and betabaculoviruses, was also found in epapgv genome . of the baculoviral early transcription genes ie- <dig>  ie- <dig>  ie- <dig> and pe <dig>  only ie- <dig>  is present in all gvs and pe <dig> was found in cpgv, crlegv, phopgv and prgv.

replication genes
genes involved in dna replication that belong to the core group were found in epapgv genome: dnapol , lef- <dig> , lef- <dig>  and helicase- <dig> .

in addition, other genes that belong to this category and were found in epapgv and in other lepidopteran baculoviruses are dbp  , lef- <dig> , ie- <dig> , me <dig>  and ac <dig> . a lef- <dig> homologue was found in a blastp search restricted to baculoviruses: the protein encoded by epap <dig> has a match with psungv lef- <dig> . this protein was demonstrated to be a baculoviral replication enhancer in acmnpv  <cit>  and bmnpv  <cit> . homologues of this gene are present in group i npvs,  <dig> group ii npvs and  <dig> gvs .

epapgv encodes a dna ligase  as do other members of the betabaculovirus genus and three npvs of group ii . this gene seems to be linked to the presence of a second helicase, helicase- <dig>   <cit> , which is fused with alk-exo in epapgv, but not in the rest of the baculovirus genomes sequenced to date.

structural genes
epapgv genome contains all the structural genes corresponding to the core group as well as the lepidopteran baculovirus genes. the structural core group genes are: p <dig>  , vp <dig> , vp <dig> , vp <dig> , gp <dig> , odv-ec <dig> , odv-e <dig> , p <dig> , pif- <dig> , pif- <dig> , pif- <dig> ; pif- <dig> ; pif-5/odv-e <dig>  and the recently discovered pif- <dig> <cit>  . lepidopteran-specific baculovirus structural genes include granulin ;  <dig> k-fp ; odv-e <dig> ; bv/odv-c <dig> , the last two are also present in gammabaculoviruses. f-protein  is the only gene shared by alpha-, beta- and deltabaculoviruses. epapgv contains  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins found in the occlusion derived virus  of piragv  <cit> . five of these orfs were only found in betabaculoviruses: epap <dig>  epap <dig>  epap <dig>  epap <dig> and epap <dig> 

auxiliary genes
in addition to core gene alk-exo , some other auxiliary genes were found in epapgv genome. viral ubiquitin  is present in gvs and all group i alphabaculoviruses. cathepsin  and chitinase  were found in some gvs and in most alphabaculoviruses. these genes are responsible for the liquefaction of the host in the final stage of infection  <cit> . their activity is readily apparent in e. aporema larvae infected with epapgv. there is also a gp <dig>  homologue, which is present in some gvs and most npvs. gp <dig> is homologous to the entomopoxvirus  fusolin which was shown to form spindle-like structures. these spindles enhance the peroral epv infection by contributing to disruption of the peritrophic membrane  <cit> . epapgv gp <dig> gene has been characterized and demonstrated to be glycosylated  <cit> . the epapgv genome includes three fibroblast growth factor homologues: fgf- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> .

the three fgf genes are present in all sequenced gvs but fgf- <dig> is also present in all alphabaculoviruses. it is thought to be implicated in the virus dissemination in the insect host  <cit> . epap <dig> encodes a superoxide dismutase homologue  which is widely distributed in baculovirus. its potential role is still unknown and controversial  <cit> .

epapgv also possesses two iap genes , iap- <dig>  and iap- <dig> . iap- <dig> is only present in betabaculovirus whereas iap- <dig> is also present in some npvs. no p <dig> homologue was found.

granulovirus-specific genes
the number of genes considered to be gv-specific has changed in the literature and will be more accurate when more complete genome sequences become available. these genes could be the basis to the differences between granuloviruses and nucleopolyhedroviruses. taking into account the analyses presented by lange et al.  <cit> , wormleaton et al. <cit> , escasa et al.  <cit> , van oers & vlak  <cit> , miele et al.  <cit>  and the present report, a set of  <dig> genes has been identified in betabaculovirus genomes which were never found in alpha-, gamma- or deltabaculoviruses . these are epapgv orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> .

other genes formerly considered as part of the gv-specific set, were dismissed from the list in the present report: cpgv orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all, except cp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  have homologues in epapgv but they are absent in some other gv .

unique genes
seventeen orfs appear to be unique to epapgv compared to the rest of the members of baculoviridae . epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa long protein with a conserved motif  in its n-terminal region. this motif is an uncharacterized conserved domain that contains ring and ccch-type zn-fingers  <cit> . an early promoter motif was found  <dig> nt upstream epap <dig> orf. epap <dig> encodes an  <dig> aa long polypeptide and has no significant blastp matches. the upstream region contains a gata motif  and two tatawaw early promoter elements, but no cakt inr. epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa protein which shares 23% identity and 43% similarity with a small portion of a  <dig> aa protein of drosophila ananassae ; however, no speculation on function can be made. epap <dig> gives no significant blastp hit, and has early promoter elements upstream of the first atg . something similar happens with epap <dig> which codes for a hypothetical  <dig> aa protein and a tataw element upstream. epap <dig>  has no significant blastp hits and has elements of an early promoter. epap <dig>  has no significant blastp hits and shows elements of a late promoter. epap <dig> codes for a hypothetical protein of  <dig> aa with no significant similarity with any protein of the genbank under the control of a putative late promoter and a gata motif .

epap <dig> codes for the longest hypothetical protein of epapgv genome . as it lacks characteristic promoter elements and exhibits no similarity with other baculovirus genes it is difficult to predict if it is actually transcribed. epap <dig> is located between the conserved genes pif- <dig>  and epap <dig> . it is worth mentioning that at least in two gvs  a similar situation emerged in the same locus. although a  <dig> aa orf with  <dig> leucine zippers was initially found in chocgv, it was not considered a coding sequence but a non-hr ori-like region instead; the speculation was based upon its very high at content , the lack of homology with baculovirus orfs, and the possibility of sequencing errors . in contrast, the  <dig> aa orf in heargv  was considered a coding sequence resulting from a fusion of the homologues xc <dig> and xc <dig> of xestia c-nigrum gv  <cit> .

epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa peptide under the control of an early promoter and showed no significant matches in blastp search. two gata motifs  were also found in the region upstream its atg. epap <dig>  shows no significant hits with any protein in the genbank. tatataa and tataa motifs were found upstream the atg, but without the initiator sequence cakt, characteristic of early promoters. epap <dig> codes for a thymidylate kinase . epap <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa peptide with no significant matches in the genbank under the control of a putative late promoter which is overlapped with a gata motif . epap <dig> predicted protein  did not have significant blastp hits either and lacks known promoter motifs except for a tataaaa sequence  <dig> nt upstream its atg overlapped with a gata motif. similarly, orfs  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contain tata box-like motifs upstream the initial atg and show no significant blastp hits. epap <dig> also presents a ataag sequence, and epap <dig> a gata motif .

nucleotide metabolism genes
genes coding for enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism have been reported in baculovirus genomes. ribonucleotide reductase  catalyses the reduction of ribose in ribonucleotide diphosphates to yield deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of dna  <cit> . in most eukaryotes the active rnr is a tetrameric complex made up of homodimers of two subunits coded by genes rr <dig> and rr <dig>  which have been also found in some npvs and  <dig> gvs: cpgv, agsegv, phopgv and epapgv . on the other hand, dutpase catalyses the dephosphorylation of dutp to yield dump. as dutp can be mutagenic if incorporated in dna, this enzyme helps to keep levels of dutp low and prevents its incorporation in dna, in lieu of dttp. this gene is present in some npvs and in the betabaculoviruses agsegv, spltgv and epapgv . the presence of rr <dig>  rr <dig> and dutpase appears to be linked in the genomes of opmnpv, spltnpv, semnpv and ldmnpv  <cit> . this linkage appears in the betabaculoviruses agsegv and epapgv but not in spltgv. both enzymes participate in the pathway of de novo dttp biosynthesis .

epapgv codes for a novel enzyme in the family baculoviridae, which also takes part in this pathway: epap <dig> codes for a predicted  <dig> aa protein homologous to thymidylate kinase, also known as thymidine monophosphate kinase , that catalyses the phosphorylation of dtmp to produce dtdp. blastp hits included different eukaryotic organisms and several viruses representing the families poxviridae , iridoviridae , herpesviridae , nimaviridae  and asfaviridae  that were used in the clustalw alignment with epapgv tmpk . epapgv tmpk showed the highest identity  with tmpk from the insect drosophila ananassae and the least  with tmpk from asfv. the degree of identity with the other viruses was 35% ; 32% ; and 33% . besides baculoviridae, other viral families that encode nucleotide metabolism genes include herpesviridae, poxviridae and asfaviridae. the alphaherpesvirus pyrimidine deoxynucleoside kinase, popularly known as thymidine kinase  phosphorylates a wide range of nucleoside substrates, as well as tmp , and is responsible for the rise in the ttp pool characteristic of hsv-infected cells  <cit> . in poxviruses these tk and tmpk activities are present in separate enzymes as happens in cellular organisms. vaccinia virus tmpk was found to be nonessential for virus replication in cultured cells and able to complement a tmpk- saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant  <cit> .

the white spot syndrome virus  genome contains a mosaic gene that encodes a tk-tmpk fusion of both homologues, i.e. cellular-type thymidine kinase tk <dig> and cellular-type tmpk  <cit> . however, only tk activity, but not tmpk, could be demonstrated for wssv tk-tmk  <cit> . tmpk substrate specificity was studied in vaccinia virus and it was found to phosphorylate dtmp, dump and, unlike human tmpk, dgmp as well  <cit> . epapgv tmpk expression and substrate specificity, as well as its role in infection, remain to be elucidated.

repeated sequences
a common feature in baculovirus genomes is the presence of nucleotide sequence repeats known as homologous regions . these regions function as enhancers of early gene transcription and are thought to play a role as origins of replication. they are characterized by tandem copies of sequence motifs that include an imperfect palindromic core. although they present significant sequence similarity within a genome they are highly variable when compared between any two different species .

in a first screening of the epapgv genome for repeated sequences with blast2seq we found two palindromic regions, of  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp , respectively. both sequences are very likely to exist in equilibrium between double stranded dna and opposite hairpin-loops constituted by each complementary strand  forming a cruciform-like structure . whether this feature is biologically relevant remains to be elucidated. using these two sequences as profiles we searched the rest of the genome for similar sequences. twenty-four at-rich sequences of similar size were detected dispersed throughout the genome. the alignment of these sequences revealed the presence of conserved palindromes of about  <dig> bp that correspond with the central part of the two initially identified largest palindromes, with a mean of 70% at content. the alignment of these shorter palindromes  shows that they have an at rich core flanked by  <dig> bp conserved inverted repeats . this structure is similar to that of hrs found in all gvs  that infect other insects of the tortricidae family : palindromic sequences of about 63– <dig> bp characterized by conserved blocks of  <dig> bp located at both ends. these ends were found to be similar in sequence not only among the palindromes of a single genome but among the different genomes, as well  <cit> . epapgv palindromic ends are similar to the consensus  <dig> bp sequence for these gvs, including phopgv . phopgv, that infects a member of the gelechiidae family but appears in the same clade as these gvs, was also found to have this kind of palindromic repeats, although their length was different   <cit> . palindromes sharing these features were analyzed in infection-dependent replication assays in cells susceptible to cpgv infection. all  <dig> cpgv palindromes were found to act as origins of replication of plasmids in infection-dependent assays in cydia pommonela cells  <cit> , whereas the hrs from other gvs tested in the same way did not show this ability, with the only exception of  <dig> palindromes of the most closely related cpgv virus, crlegv  <cit> .

these palindromic sequences are found with a much greater frequency in epapgv dna compared to the other tortricid-specific gvs. epapgv contains  <dig> palindromes , whereas the others have up to  <dig> palindromes as is the case of crlegv  <cit> . in contrast, only four hrs  were reported in the most recently published betabaculovirus genome sequence .

there seem to be some conserved locations for the hrs in gv genomes. for example, the region between sod and p <dig> and downstream of the cpgv orf  <dig>  <cit> .

it has been reported for acmnpv that vlf- <dig>  binds with high affinity to cruciform dna structures and it was suggested that this may play an important role in the replication/packaging process  <cit> . these cruciform structures, formed by the two largest palindromes or by the smaller ones interspersed in the epapgv genome, may as well interact with vlf- <dig> and play a role in the replication or packaging.

in addition to the  <dig> palindromes mentioned above, there is a large structure consisting of  <dig> bp flanked by the  <dig> bp conserved ends predicted to form the secondary structures shown in figure  <dig>  this structure is located in the hr <dig> region , an at-rich sequence between orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  the sequence organization is depicted in figure  <dig> showing orf  <dig> within hr4b, which also contains two  <dig> bp direct repeats , and an intergenic region with a second pair of imperfect direct repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> bp , respectively. interestingly, this region is located in the same relative position where a putative non-hr ori was described in cpgv spanning orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>  and in crlegv  <cit> .

relationships with other baculoviruses
strong colinearity is observed in granulovirus genomes sequenced to date  <cit> . baculovirus gene colinearity has been analysed mainly by gene parity plot  <cit> . in this study we used the artemis comparison tool to analyse the gene synteny of epapgv compared to all other sequenced gvs and the type species of the alphabaculovirus genus, acmnpv. this tool enables to construct synteny maps through a tblastx comparison between genomes, where inversions are easily detected as well as the different percentages of identities that correlate with different colour intensity. figure  <dig> shows the conserved gene colinearity of all  <dig> sequenced gv genomes and the poorly conserved synteny between gvs and acmnpv. notably epapgv differs from the rest of the gvs by a ca.  <dig> kb gene block inversion, as we noted previously in a physical map  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis based on  <dig> concatenated core genes of  <dig> baculovirus genomes was performed . the obtained cladogram reproduced the grouping of four genera recognized in the current classification of the family  <cit> . division in two main groups of the alphabaculovirus genus agrees with the group i and ii. two clades  previously described in group i by using concatenated amino acid sequences of the partial polh/gran, lef- <dig> and lef- <dig> genes  <cit>  were also confirmed in our analysis.

as expected, epapgv grouped in the betabaculovirus genus. in previous reports it was observed that totricidae and noctuidae specific gvs tend to be in separated groups  <cit> . the cladogram obtained in this work confirms previous observations, and the additional complete genomes considered here allowed the division of betabaculoviruses in two well separated monophyletic clades as reported previously  <cit> . clade “a” includes six species: pxgv, agsegv, spligv, psungv and xcgv, which were isolated mainly from noctuidae hosts. pxgv is the exception; its host belongs to the plutellidae family. clade “b” includes seven species: epapgv, adorgv, phopgv, cpgv, crlegv, piragv and chocgv; five of them were isolated from tortricidae, whereas piragv was isolated from pieridae and phopgv, from gelechiidae. epapgv seems to be the gv isolate closest to the common ancestor of clade “b”. both clades includes slow killing  and fast killing , reinforcing the concept of that this biological feature is not phylogenetically informative  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study the complete genome of epapgv was characterized. it includes genes that are common to all baculovirus, and others that have been found only in some of the isolates; in addition, it contains  <dig> genes that are not shared with the rest of the family:  <dig> with unknown functions, and one encoding a tmpk homologue which may have been captured from of a host genome or a different coinfecting pathogen. also a set of  <dig> betabaculovirus-specific genes, was determined. the information collected and analyzed in this study provides ground for further investigations to improve the understanding of the molecular steps involved in epapgv infection.

the analyses of gene order and identity suggest that evolution of baculoviruses occurred via acquisition of both individual genes  and larger blocks of host dna sequences followed by events of inversions, deletions, and re-acquisitions of previously lost sequences. interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis suggested that epapgv is situated closest to the common ancestor of clade b betabaculovirus.
