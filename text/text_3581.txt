BACKGROUND
homeodomain  containing transcription factors are key regulators implicated in the determination of cell fate and cell differentiation in both plants and animals. in angiosperms, a gene called wuschel  has been isolated from many different species. wus was the first identified member of the wuschel-related homeobox  subfamily  <cit>  that is only found in plants.

the specific expression of the wox genes in different plant organs and cell types  <cit>  suggested an important role for them during organogenesis. the wus gene is expressed in a restricted region of the meristem called the organizing centre located below the stem cells of the shoot apical meristem  and functions non-cell autonomously to control the stem cell fate  <cit> . interestingly gallois et al  <cit>  showed recently that ectopic expression of wus in the root establishes shoot stem cells and leaf development. other members of the wox family might also prevent premature cell differentiation in developing organs or tissues. recently, wox <dig> was shown to be involved in stem cell maintenance signaling in the root  <cit> . wu et al  <cit>  have shown that wox <dig>  prevents premature cell differentiation during organ growth, in addition to contributing positively to wus expression. this work also revealed that stip mutants can be rescued by sucrose, a modulator of cell proliferation trough cyclin d induction  <cit> . two other wox genes, named narrow sheath  <dig> and  <dig>  that are maize orthologues of arabidopsis thaliana atwox <dig> were shown to be involved in the recruitment of the lateral founder cells within the sam prior to the primordia development  <cit> . last, haecker et al  <cit>  analyzed the expression dynamics of the wox genes during a. thaliana embryo development and showed that members of the wox family mark cell fate decisions during embryonic patterning. taken together, these results suggest that not only wus but several other wox genes play a role in regulating cell division and preventing cell differentiation.

characterized genomes of angiosperms contain more than  <dig> different woxs and phylogenetic studies suggest that the wox family existed in the last common ancestor of monocots and core eudicots  <cit> . a recent wox phylogeny based on wox hds from different angiosperms, the moss physcomitrella patens and the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii showed that all of the p. patens and eight of the s. moellendorffii wox genes clustered in the same clade  <cit> . indeed, the phylogenetic analyses of a transcription factor family like wox suffer from some limitations due to the relatively short length of the hd, which is the only conserved sequence between the wox protein family members, and the relatively few land plant species with a completely characterized proteome. as a consequence, the patterns of phylogenic trees of large families of plant transcription factors are often weakly supported by statistics and may be affected by long branch attraction  <cit> . nevertheless, clade specific gene features and protein domains were observed in transcription factors  <cit> . thus, in this study, we used clade specific signatures beyond the hd and clade specific conservation of intron insertion sites, to provide additional data in support of the orthology links predicted by the wox phylogeny. in order to carry out the latter analyses, complete genome sequences with accurate structural annotations are essential. our results strongly support the existence of a wox <dig> orthologous group  that, contrary to the two other wox ogs, contains genes from many different members of the plant kingdom, including basal species, and a branch apparently specific to brassicaceae. to obtain information on the function of the genes belonging to the wox <dig> clade, the cell specificity of at wox <dig> and at wox <dig> expression was established experimentally and phenotypes resulting from mutations within these two genes were characterized in the plant model a. thaliana.

RESULTS
a wox distance tree from model genomes
we carefully screened several completely sequenced eukaryote genomes for wox genes, i.e., two angiosperms, a. thaliana and o. sativa, three algae, o. tauri, o. lucimarinus and chlamydomonas reinhardtii and two yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. no wox genes were identified outside of the plant kingdom and ostreococcus revealed only one wox gene per genome. moreover, using the hmmsearch tool  <cit> , we found only one hd gene in c. reinhardtii,  <dig> in s. pombe,  <dig> in o. tauri and  <dig> in s. cerevisiae compared to the  <dig> hd genes in a. thaliana.

distance and phylogenic trees were computed from the hd sequences of the wox proteins from the five plant model genomes, o. tauri, p. patens, s. moellendorffii, a. thaliana and o. sativa . the clustering of the wox proteins in  <dig> different ogs were consistent using either the neighbor-joining  or the maximum likelihood  methods and different outgroups. the topology of the trees clearly showed three different ogs namely the wox <dig>  wox <dig> and wox <dig> mogs . each og contained rice and arabidopsis proteins, but the single wox protein of o. tauri, the three p. patens and the three s. moellendorffii wox proteins were all found in the same group, the wox <dig> mog. the wox <dig> mog contained atwox1- <dig> and atwus, the wox <dig> og associated atwox <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the wox <dig> og included atwox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  thus, the previous observation of the presence of the p. patens proteins only in the wox <dig> og group was extended to o. tauri and s. moellendorffii. however, the introduction of otwox and the smwoxs did not change the main branching of the trees nor significantly modified the bootstrap values at the internal node of the tree. the  <dig> available wox sequences from different gymnosperms were distributed between the three ogs . furthermore, the trees we obtained were not consistent with the phylogenetic tree of plant species as it is now known  <cit> . thus the wox trees we produced suggest probably several rounds of gene deletions in o. tauri and p. patens in order to explain the branching of the wox <dig> og. the finding that all the wox sequences of o. tauri and p. patens, as well as those of s. moellendorffii were clustered in the wox <dig> og suggested to us that atwox <dig>   <dig>   <dig> might represent the most interesting genes to study the functional diversification of the wox genes although they are the wox genes for which we have the least functional information . this prompted us to look at the specificity of the wox <dig> og with regards to gene structure and conserved amino acid signatures other than the hd. conservation in gene structure is an indication of a common ancestor while conserved amino acid signatures are linked to functions such as protein-protein interactions or regulatory sites.

wox gene structures
the intron-exon organization of wox genes from the model genomes showed different gene structures . alignments supporting the conservation of intron insertion sites are given in additional file 2: figure  <dig>  the organization of the gene structures along the phylogeny tree did not reveal any contradiction between gene structures and tree pattern. intron site conservations were exclusively observed within each of the three ogs and never between them. in this context, it was interesting to observe that the insertion site of the first intron in atwox <dig> is conserved in almost all the genes  belonging to the wox <dig> og. the only exception was ppawox <dig>  a possible pseudogene . this observation cannot be extended to o. tauri as its genes do not have introns. s. moellendorffii genes have introns and the three full-length smwoxs have one conserved intron insertion site downstream from the wox <dig> motif. the latter intron of smwoxs is in a similar position  to the first highly conserved intron of wox <dig> og genes in moss and angiosperms. nevertheless, there is no trace of amino acid sequence conservation in the corresponding protein region between s. moellendorffii and the other genes in the wox <dig> og . when taken together, our analyses of intron insertion sites support the boundaries of the wox <dig> og as defined by phylogeny. in addition to the highly conserved intron upstream of the hd coding sequence found in the wox <dig> og, atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> share another conserved intron insertion site downstream of the hd while os01g <dig> and atwox <dig> share a different intron insertion site in the 3' region of the gene. the tree pattern implies first a loss of the orthologues of atwox <dig> and  <dig> in o. sativa and in p. patens and secondly that atwox <dig> and os01g <dig> are orthologous. interestingly, the two latter genes share a specific intron insertion site.

specific motifs in the wox proteins
a search for specific motifs other than the hd used to build the distance and phylogeny trees led us to identify hmms that were specific to each clade and located either within the n or the c terminal regions of the different proteins. these hmms are illustrated by sequence logos  and by alignments . only proteins of the wox <dig> clade have a small motif of  <dig> amino acids  in the c-terminal region, but at relatively variable distances from the hd. tlxlfp has previously been described as a characteristic motif of wus proteins  <cit> , but we show here that it is common to the entire wox <dig> clade, i.e., it is observed not only in wus, but also in the atwox1- <dig> proteins. however, the wus proteins of a. thaliana  and o. sativa  share specific features not observed in any of the other proteins of the wox <dig> mog. indeed, they display 1) the lelxl wus motif  <cit>  known as ear-like or erf-like motifs that are located in the outmost c-terminal region, similar to a motif found in potent transcriptional repressors in plants i.e., superman  <cit>  and aux/iaa  <cit> ; 2) the same intron exon structure in the coding regions of each gene; and 3) an additional amino acid at a conserved position in the homeodomain.

nearly all proteins of the wox <dig> mog contain two contiguous motifs of  <dig> amino acids situated near to their c-terminus . the latter motifs are surrounded by two conserved introns. remarkably, these introns are also found in os05g <dig> in which the vfin-wox <dig> mog motif is replaced by a non-conserved sequence of a similar length.

all the proteins of the wox <dig> mog, except for ppawox <dig>  share a  <dig> amino acid motif that is found upstream from the hd and named the wox <dig> mog motif. this observation provides further support for the validity of the wox <dig> og as defined by phylogeny and to the hypothesis of a specific function of the genes clustered within. for all of these reasons, it was decided to investigate further the wox <dig> clade.

wox <dig> og distance tree
thirty three full length wox proteins were used to reconstruct the distance tree of the wox <dig> clade , using otwox as the outgroup. the neighbor-joining tree showed two main branches. the first branch contained all of the gymnosperm and the moss woxs. the second branch contained atwox <dig> together with many angiosperm sequences. this branch was further separated into two branches, one contained atwox <dig> and many proteins from different angiosperms while the second contained atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> and a brassica rapa sequence.

the preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supported the separation of the different gene groups within the trees. obviously, all proteins of the wox <dig> clade displayed the wox hd and the wox <dig> motif. moreover, we also identified specific motifs for the atwox <dig>   <dig> and for the atwox <dig> branches . all angiosperm proteins located inside the wox <dig> og shared two motifs, the yxdpl-wox <dig> motif located between the wox <dig> mog motif and the hd, and the esexe-wox <dig> motif just downstream from the hd. the monocots of the atwox <dig> branch also share a specific motif called the monocot-wox <dig> motif that was detected also in two other partial proteins of two monocotyledon species.

proteins of the atwox <dig>   <dig> branch shared two specific motifs, the yfdpm-wox <dig> and qaddaavtt-wox <dig> motifs. they were located to the same region of the protein as the yxdpl-wox <dig> and esexe-wox <dig> motifs, respectively. hence, the similarity between the yfdpm-wox <dig> og and yxdpl-wox <dig> motifs suggested a common origin. partial protein sequences from brassica oleracea and raphanus raphanistrum subsp. raphanistrum  confirmed the specificity of the motifs to brassicaceae. thus, the atwox <dig> containing branch appears to be brassicaceae specific since: 1) all the sequences containing the two atwox <dig>   <dig> motifs are from brassicaceae and 2) no species other than those belonging to the brassicaceae displayed any of these two motifs.

the gymnosperm and moss branch contained proteins that shared the esexe-wox <dig> og motif with the angiosperm wox <dig> proteins, located at the same position relative to the hd. they also shared two other motifs specific to this branch: 1) the lxxgq-gymnosperm/moss-wox og motif that was at the same position as the yxdpl-wox <dig> og or yfdpm-wox <dig> og motifs and 2) a supplementary motif in the c-terminal region of the proteins.

functional wox <dig> og genes in the three model plants
we investigated the expression profiles of the wox <dig> og genes within  <dig> plant model species namely o. tauri, p. patens and a. thaliana because of their position within the green lineage. o. tauri is a highly proliferating unicellular alga that has no known differentiated form. in addition to the wox gene, we also identified a single copy of a knox-like gene  within the o. tauri genome. in angiosperms, members of the class- <dig> knox subfamily act to prevent cell differentiation within the sam  <cit> . interestingly, the otknox protein showed the characteristics of both the class- <dig> and class- <dig> knox conserved domains, suggesting that o. tauri had diverged from a common ancestor before the diversification of the knox gene into  <dig> classes.

in order to monitor the expression of wox and knox genes during the progression of the cell cycle, we partially light-synchronized a cell suspension of o. tauri as described before in  <cit> . rt-pcr and quantitative pcr analyses of cyclin b and histone  <dig> genes showed a peak of expression at  <dig> h, confirming the overlapping of the g2/m and s subpopulations . the otrh <dig> , and otrh <dig>  genes, respectively the orthologues of the arabidopsis dead-box rna-helicase  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  were used as controls of constitutively expressed genes. they did not show any significant variation, and they were not cell cycle regulated . more importantly, the wox and the knox genes were found to be constitutively expressed and not cell cycle regulated , with a higher expression level for wox compared to knox .

in p. patens, the initial gametophytic phase consists of an array of filamentous tubes that are formed after cell initials are produced from the main filament. further development proceeds by the formation of buds which form the initial meristem from which originates the leafy adult gametophyte  <cit> . these processes rely on a tight control of cellular differentiation throughout the gametophyte development. an analysis of wox expression in p. patens was carried out on 4-, 10- and 14-day-old plants corresponding respectively to the protonema, the bud and the gametophore stages under our growth conditions . rt-pcr analyses showed that ppawox <dig> and ppawox <dig> were expressed throughout gametophyte development whereas ppawox <dig> transcripts were not detected , thus supporting the hypothesis that ppawox <dig> could be a pseudogene.

an exhaustive data mining analysis of a. thaliana expression databases  <cit>  indicated that, both atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> transcripts are present at different developmental stages i. e., embryo development, plantlet stage, root formation, bolting stage, in flowers and in response to stress . however, no atwox <dig> transcripts were present in any of the databases analyzed. in addition, rt-pcr analyses of seedlings, even with a high pcr cycle number, did not allow us to detect the atwox <dig> mrna . these results suggested that the recently duplicated atwox <dig> gene, found only in the a. thaliana genome, might be a pseudogene. based on these observations, this gene was not further characterized. we conclude that in the three plant model genomes studied at least one copy of the wox13og genes is expressed during development.

atwox <dig> shows a dynamic expression profile during a. thaliana development
compared to other wox proteins, the function of the atwox <dig> and  <dig> proteins have received little attention to date . in order to carry out a more detailed analysis of the wox <dig> og genes in a. thaliana, we cloned the gene coding for the gus reporter under the control of the atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> upstream regulatory sequences. based on our data mining analyses , we first analyzed the gus expression during root development. atwox <dig> promoter activity was detected during lateral root formation . to validate the specificity of these data, in situ hybridization experiments were performed using respectively atwox <dig> , gus  and cuc <dig> as probes . the signal obtained using the atwox <dig> and gus probes matched perfectly with the above gus staining, whereas the cuc <dig> probe, as expected, did not give any specific signal. hence, the gus staining obtained reflects stable tissue specific mrna expression and revealed that the atwox <dig> promoter sequence, used to drive the reporter gene gus expression was sufficient to mimic the tissue specific localization of the endogenous atwox <dig> mrna.

atwox <dig> expression was detected at the early stage of the lateral root  formation of 10-days-old seedlings and it persisted during lr emergence . the gus staining was progressively restrained to the distal meristem  and it strongly accumulated in both the columella and the adjacent lateral root cap cells at a later developmental stage . in mature lr or primary roots of 10-day-old seedlings no staining was detected within the root tip.

the atwox <dig> expression pattern was also investigated using the atwox13::gus lines, during plant development. in 5-day-old seedlings, the promoter activity was strong in both cotyledon and root vasculatures, the pericycle and in the stem cells of the primary root meristem . no gus staining was detected in the division zone of the root. in the vegetative apex of  <dig> day-old seedlings, a strong staining was observed in the leaf primordia . in the flower, the atwox <dig> promoter was active in the vasculature, the stigma  and in the gynoecium at the flower stage 13/ <dig> . at this developmental stage, when fertilization was ongoing and pollen grains were germinating at the tip of the gynoecium, ovules stained blue . later on, the young embryos remained stained , but no staining was observed in mature siliques indicating that the atwox <dig> promoter was no longer active , as observed before in all the other mature organs. during germination, soon after seed imbibition, gus staining was also seen within the vasculature and the root tip, as observed in young seedlings . hence, atwox <dig> expression was restricted to differentiating organs and therefore probably regulated by developmental signals.

atwox <dig> promoter specificity differs from that of atwox13
compared to the atwox <dig> expression patterns, the activity of atwox <dig> was more restrictive during lateral root formation. as for atwox <dig>  the atwox <dig> promoter activity, revealed by gus staining, was detected in the lr primordia, but decreased progressively as the lr emerged becoming restricted in fine to the vasculature up to the lr junction . the atwox13::gus gene continued to be expressed for a longer time . in 5-day-old seedlings, atwox <dig> driven gus activity was only found in the vascular system and in the pericycle of the primary root . in the lr of 14-day-old seedlings , gus staining was again observed in the vasculature and the pericycle with atwox <dig> expression being progressively induced in the pericycle and in the vasculature as the lr developed. compared to the activity of the atwox <dig> promoter, atwox14::gus expression stopped at a longer distance further up from the root tip , exactly at the position where the youngest lr primordia were initiated .

during flower development, atwox14::gus expression was detected in the stamen at floral stage 11/ <dig> , when mitotic divisions of microspores are known to occur  <cit> . the staining decreased as the stamen matured, showing that the function of wox <dig> is linked to the early stages of organ and tissue development. hence, as for atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> promoter activity also seems to be regulated by developmental signals. the gene expression profile reported in the gene atlas  <cit>  and the tissues and organs affected by the mutation of atwox <dig>  agree with the expression profile described above.

an atwox <dig> gene truncated downstream of the homeodomain neither alters root nor flower development
the only available wox <dig> mutant line, identified in gabi-kat  <cit>  and numbered 193g <dig>  showed a t-dna insertion upstream of the sequence coding for the characteristic wfqn motif located at the end of the wox homeodomain . rt-pcr experiments carried out using polya+-rna, prepared from the wox <dig> 193g <dig> line, and primers matching each side of the insertion site, did not yield any pcr product . because of the position of the insertion at the end of the wox homeodomain, we also carried out an expression analysis using another couple of primers matching the 5'utr of the atwox <dig> mrna and the left border of the t-dna. the latter experiment led to the amplification of a  <dig> bp pcr product, the sequence of which coded for a putative chimeric protein of  <dig> residues composed of the  <dig> amino acids of the atwox <dig> n-terminal region plus an additional  <dig> amino acids specified by the t-dna sequence.

based on the expression profiles obtained using the gus reporter gene constructs, an analysis of the primary root growth of the mutant lines was carried out after seed germination. surprisingly, the above wox <dig> mutation neither affected primary root growth , nor vegetative and flower development. the only phenotype appeared to be a much earlier floral transition .

a wox <dig> knock-out mutant modifies lateral root and stamen development of a. thaliana
conversely to the wox <dig> mutant, a wox <dig> insertion mutant line  with the entire wox homeodomain deleted  displayed developmental defects in all the organs where gus staining was observed. the primary root growth was retarded  and after flowering, the pst <dig> insertion line showed partial sterility , with aborted and shorter siliques compared to the wild type . the floral transition was also altered, however the phenotype observed was that of a late flowering mutant .

the wox <dig> mutant was further characterized during plant development. whereas in the wild type nossen a fully developed network of lr was observed , the lr formation in wox <dig> was strongly inhibited . the pst <dig> line displayed extra adventitious roots  whereas the wild type plants developed only one or two. at the reproductive stage, observations after tissue clearing showed that the shorter siliques of wox <dig> contained many ovules that did not develop into seeds , compared to the wild type . since the atwox <dig> promoter was only active in the developing stamen, pollen grain viability was checked using alexander staining. as shown in figure 6q and 6r, the anthers of both the wild type and the wox <dig> mutant contained viable pollen grains when compared to the sterile dmc <dig> rnai line  <cit> . however, stamen development was severely affected in the wox <dig> mutant. in open flowers of the wild type plants, the stamens were longer than the gynoecium allowing complete fertilization of the ovule . in contrast, in the mutant line, the stamen did not fully develop and remained shorter than the gynoecium thereby preventing efficient fertilization and causing ovule abortion. in some wox <dig> flowers, the phenotype was even more severe, with aborted stamens that developed to only half the size of the gynoecium . these data suggested that atwox <dig> prevents premature organ and tissue differentiation at the floral stage.

discussion
to improve previously described and not completely congruent wox phylogenies  <cit>  we performed multi alignments on protein sequences  longer than the usually defined hd . furthermore, we used gene or protein features other than the hd sequence to support the three ogs exhibited by our phylogenic trees. even if the wox gene phylogeny remains difficult to reconcile with species phylogeny, we are confident about the gene distribution between the three main ogs. only one wox gene was detected in the basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism o. tauri and three wox genes were identified in moss p. patens, including at least two functional paralogues. the wox <dig> og is the clade containing the most conserved wox genes as it is the only clade that contains the o. tauri, the p. patens and probably the eight s. moellendorffii genes. it also showed a recent and specific expansion in brassicaceae. these observations point out the interest in the study of the wox <dig> og with respect to its biological specificity and gene family evolution.

wox <dig> orthologues are only observed in brassicaceae species
we detected atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> mrnas at different stages of plant development, in plantlets, roots, flowers and developing embryos. these expression profiles were in accordance with those described in a compendium of a. thaliana expression databases for the wox <dig> og genes  <cit> . for instance, in the gene expression map of the arabidopsis root  <cit> , the atwox <dig> mrna profile shows a localized expression domain  specific to the stele in the elongation zone of the mature primary root as observed in our study. these databases also revealed that the expression levels of both atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> were low compared to other wox genes, suggesting either a tight control of their expression or a cell specific expression pattern. this has been confirmed by the expression data described in this paper.

the atwox <dig> branch within the wox <dig> og, has previously been suggested to be unique to a. thaliana  <cit> . our study based on more species indicates that this branch also contains sequences from other brassicaceae. interestingly, differences in the expression profiles between atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> indicate that their 5' regulatory elements have diverged since gene duplication. in line with this conclusion, our data mining analyses showed that atwox <dig> expression, but not that of atwox <dig>  was modulated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. hence, the atwox <dig> promoter appears to have diverged to presumably support specific developmental mechanisms found so far only in brassicaceae. analysis of the expression profile of a non brassicaceae wox <dig> gene should give us a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to this particular branch.

wox <dig> og genes affect organogenesis and floral transition
the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during organ development are essential processes that require genes implicated in cell signaling, cell identity and cell cycle transitions. in higher plants, both the sam and the root pericycle cells serve as initiation sites of organogenesis  <cit> . in this paper, we show that atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> are active in organ primordia and during early tissue differentiation. in the transcriptomic database catdb  <cit> , in which only the atwox <dig> probe is available,  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments associate atwox <dig> gene expression with cell proliferation and growth. interestingly, the transcriptome profiling experiments, using protoplast cultures  <cit> , showed that the atwox <dig> mrna level followed an expression profile similar to that of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen  <dig> gene , a key regulator of dna metabolism and cell cycle progression  <cit> . conversely, the homeobox gene athb <dig>  a marker of cell differentiation and elongation  <cit> , strongly decreased in the same protoplast culture. compared to the cell cycle gene , atwox <dig> expression levels were maximal when the cells entered cell division. atwox <dig> expression was also up-regulated in the tor mutant or after a treatment with the ip3k inhibitor, wortmannin. the tor protein and ip3k are regulators of cell division and growth. tor has only been found in non-differentiated and rapidly dividing meristematic cells  <cit> . however, the dynamic expression of atwox <dig> during lr development described in this paper does not entirely overlap with the cell division zone, as atwox <dig> promoter activity became more restricted to the vasculature of the root.

our data also showed that mutations of the atwox <dig> and  <dig> genes affected the floral transition. an increase of cell division in all the vegetative sam was proposed to be a prerequisite for morphological changes at the floral transition in plants  <cit> . furthermore, in a. thaliana stem axis growth is the result of cell elongation that occurs only in the rib zone and not in the upper part of the sam  <cit> . hence, the late flowering phenotype observed in the wox <dig> mutant might reflect a default in the coordination of cell division and elongation in the transitional sam. in contrast, the wox <dig> mutant line showed a surprising early floral transition. however, a chimeric wox <dig> mrna coding for a putative protein containing the conserved domains was expressed in the wox <dig> 193g <dig> line. we suggest that this line might act as a dominant negative mutant that induces early floral transition by activating precocious cell proliferation in the sam. alternatively, we cannot exclude that other wox family members could fulfill the function of the atwox <dig> protein, leading to a weak phenotype in the arabidopsis mutant background. to date, the mechanism underlying gene regulation by the homeobox gene family is complex and remains largely unclear  <cit> . a monitoring of the promoter activity during the floral transition and an analysis of a mutant line with an insertion upstream of the hd or an rnai strategy should give us better insights into the function of the wox <dig> protein.

finally, we found that the wox <dig> null mutant showed root growth delay and early anther maturation. interestingly, a similar phenotype was also observed in anthers when cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were ectopically expressed in plants  <cit> . hence, it is tempting to speculate that the atwox <dig> protein is involved in the negative control of cell differentiation to allow for correct development.

in a similar way, the expression profile observed during the gametophytic development of p. patens is consistent with a putative function in cell differentiation control during the filamentous growth and the bud formation although in situ hybridization experiment are needed to validate this hypothesis. last, the constitutive expression of the only wox gene in o. tauri may account for its maintenance in an undifferentiated state. future use of o. tauri and p. patens as biological models and ongoing complementation experiments of mutants using either full length or truncated proteins should allow us to obtain a better understanding of the functional importance of the wox <dig> og genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide evidence in favor of the wox <dig> og as the clade containing the most conserved wox genes. the preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supports the separation of the different gene groups in the phylogenetic trees. however, the latter is not consistent with the green plant phylogeny  <cit> . in this study, we linked the function of the wox13og arabidopsis members to organ initiation and development, most likely by preventing premature differentiation as shown for other wox proteins. the data also suggest that the wox family has diverged both at the transcriptional and protein level to generate new features that control cell identity in specific domains of land plants. in line with such evolutionary events, the expression profile and mutant phenotype of the atwox <dig> gene suggest that the brassicaceae might have developed specific mechanisms to control floral transition and pollen formation when compared to other plants.
