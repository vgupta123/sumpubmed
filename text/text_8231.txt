BACKGROUND
as the largest internal organ, the liver is responsible for about  <dig> vital bodily functions, and plays important roles in digestion and metabolism by regulating the production, storage, and release of sugar, fats, and cholesterol. the liver produces a variety of important proteins, including enzymes, hormones, blood proteins, clotting factors, and immune factors. as the main site of detoxification and the primary defense barrier, the liver is liable to be injured by weaning stress
 <cit> . weaning stress in piglets is often associated with reduced food consumption as well as temporary reductions in weight gain, which can result in postweaning lag, a period of decreased feed intake and increased diarrhea, disease, intestinal dysfunction and atrophy, and mortality in piglets
 <cit> . a healthy liver can produce approximately  <dig> percent of the body’s required amino acids, among which l-arginine  is essential; when arg turnover increases, as in growth, inflammation, or tissue repair, the dietary supply can become rate-limiting for arg-metabolizing pathways
 <cit> . arg deficiency can result in hyperammonemia, and intestinal and immunological dysfunction
 <cit> . the administration of arg reduces damage to liver tissue after ischaemia injury
 <cit> . urea synthesis from primary hepatocytes seems to be a valid viability indicator, since mitochondrial transmembrane transport of the urea cycle intermediates ornithine and citrulline is involved in the urea cycle
 <cit> .

heat shock protein  <dig>  is a member of a highly conserved family that possess a variety of functions, but are best known for chaperoning and re-folding partially denatured protein
 <cit> . the hepatic response to stress may involve the synthesis and accumulation of hsp70s
 <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that some amino acids such as glutamine and arginine regulate hsp expression, which is essential for preventing organ dysfunction
 <cit> . the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of arg on photomicrographs and hsp <dig> expression in the liver under weaning stress in piglets.

methods
animals, housing and treatments
twelve healthy landrace × yorkshire piglets weaned at  <dig> d  were randomly divided into a control group and an arg group . the diet in the control group was made iso-nitrogenous with the addition of appropriate amounts of alanine  at the expense of lactose and glucose, as described by kim et al.
 <cit> . the nutrients in the basal diet were adequate for piglets to meet the nrc-recommended requirements within the weight range used in the present study
 <cit> . the main ingredients in the basal diet were corn , soybean meal , fishmeal , whey powder , and cream  . the diets were balanced with respect to the standardized content of de , cp , true ileal digestible limiting amino acids , ca and p, according to our previous study
 <cit> . the diets were administered three times daily at 08: <dig>  12: <dig>  and 18: <dig>  respectively. all of the animals had free access to drinking water.

 <dig> providing the following per kg diet: cuso4 · 5h2o, <dig>  mg; ki,  <dig>  mg;feso4 · 7h2o, 400 mg; naseo <dig>   <dig>  mg; znso4 · 7h2o, 359 mg; mnso4 · h2o,  <dig>  mg; vitamin k , 5 mg; vitamin b <dig>  2 mg; vitamin b <dig>  15 mg; vitamin b <dig>  30 μg; vitamin a, 5400 iu; vitamin d <dig>  110 iu; vitamin e, 18 iu; choline chloride, 80 mg; antioxidants, 20 mg; fungicide 100 mg.

 <dig> chemical composition was calcualted and not analyzed.

arg was obtained from ajinomoto .

the experiment was carried out in accordance with the chinese guidelines for animal welfare and approved by the animal welfare committee of the institute of subtropical agriculture, the chinese academy of sciences.

sampling
at age  <dig> d, blood samples were obtained for the analysis of serum indices. all of the experimental piglets were anaesthetised with an i.v injection of sodium pentobarbital  and bled by exsanguination. liver samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − <dig> for real-time pcr and western blotting analysis. additional liver samples from the same location were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for two hours at  <dig>  transferred to pbs overnight and 30% sucrose for 2 hours at  <dig>  and then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic studies. the histological activity index  were evaluated according to ishak and colleagues
 <cit> .

serum biochemical indices
an automated biochemistry analyzer  was used to determine the concentrations of serum glucose, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase , glutamic-pyruvic transaminase , lactic acid , lactate dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphatase  activities, according to commercial kits and the manufacturer’s instructions. all kits were purchased from beijing chemlin biotech co., ltd .

serum cortisol  was determined by radioimmunoassay according to the instructions of the manufacturer of the corresponding reagent kit .

immunohistochemistry for hsp70
paraffin-embedded liver tissue samples were processed using an immunohistochemical technique with specific anti-hsp <dig>  diluted 1: <dig> using pbs buffer. samples were subjected to antigen retrieval and the reduction of non-specific binding. the tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody in a humidified chamber at 4°c. after the tissue sections were rinsed with tris buffered saline , ph  <dig> , they were incubated at room temperature for 30 min for the detection of hsp <dig>  the bcip-nbt substrate system  was used to detect alkaline phosphatase conjugate activity. the sections were then counterstained with haematoxylin for 5 s, and then rinsed, dried and mounted with coverslips. the sections were examined by light microscopy and images were captured with a digital camera.

real-time pcr for hsp70
total rna was extracted from liver tissue by a guanidinium isothiocyanate method using trizoltm reagent  and treated with dnase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the mrna of hsp <dig> was determined by a standard real-time polymerase chain reaction  method as previously described
 <cit> . the following primer pairs were used: gapdh:  and hsp <dig>  based on the following conditions: 30 s of denaturation at  <dig>  30 s of annealing at  <dig>  and 30 s of extension at  <dig> for 30 cycles.

western blot for hsp70
to confirm the results of immunohistochemistry, the expression of hsp <dig> in the liver was detected by western blot assay. western blot analysis was performed as described previously
 <cit> , with gapdh as a loading control. one hundred-microgram samples were homogenized in  <dig> volumes of buffer a  and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min at  <dig>  the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes. the protein content was quantified using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit , and aliquots of 10 μg were taken individually from each sample, mixed with a one-fifth volume of the sample buffer , and then heat-denatured by boiling for 5 min. separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes  overnight at  <dig>  and then incubated with a blocking solution  for 1 h. membranes were then incubated in a 1: <dig> dilution of monoclonal antibody raised against hsp <dig> diluted 1: <dig> for two hours at room temperature. similar treatment of the same blot sheet was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-gapdh antibody diluted 1: <dig>  after the first antibody treatment had been stripped off. the membrane was incubated with appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody prepared in pbs-tween  <dig>  membranes were then washed and incubated in the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody  at a 1: <dig> dilution at room temperature for 2 h. primary antibody binding was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit  and hyperfilm-mp .

immunohistochemical staining was performed on an alpha innotech   <dig> image station with fluorchem software using enhanced chemiluminescence  as the chromagen. the relative intensities of the western blot membranes were compared using alpha ease software.

statistical analysis
the data were analyzed by student’s t-test, with the significance level set at  <dig> . a p-value of p >  <dig>  but p <  <dig>  was taken to indicate a trend. data are presented as the mean ± standard error.

RESULTS
effect of arg on liver weight and serum biochemical indices
the liver tended to be heavy in the arg group  . compared to the control piglets, arg increased serum alp , and decreased got , lactic acid  and cor . arg did not affect glu or amylase .

effects of arg on pathological findings
histopathological changes such as sinusoidal dilatation, hepatocellular vacuolization and hepatocellular necrosis were present. moderate cell infiltration was seen in the periportal areas. histopathologic examination showed increases in lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the central and portal areas in the livers of the control group. in some areas, microvesicular steatosis and hepatocyte degeneration were also observed. hepatic ischaemia was seen in the control groups. in the arg group, inflammatory reactions were decreased and other changes were almost absent in liver sections . hai was lower in the arg group  .

immunohistochemistry, real-time pcr, and western blot for hsp <dig> in liver
immunohistochemistry studies showed different behaviors of hsp <dig> expression. the immunohistochemical localization of hsp <dig> in the liver revealed stronger expression in the arg group .

real-time pcr showed that the level of hsp <dig> mrna in the liver was higher in the arg group  . to confirm the results of immunohistochemistry, liver tissues were subjected to western blot assay. representative results are shown in figure 
 <dig>  the expression of hsp <dig> in the control group was lower than that in the arg group .

discussion
in rodents and humans, arg is essential when arg turnover increases, as in growth, inflammation, or tissue repair, and the dietary supply can become rate-limiting for arg-metabolizing pathways
 <cit> . indeed, low arg levels have been documented in weaning-age piglets
 <cit> . it has been reported that, compared to that in newborn pigs, the intestinal synthesis of citrulline and arg from glutamine and glutamate decreases by 70-73% in 7-d-old suckling pigs, and declines further in 14- to 21-d-old pigs
 <cit> .

in the present study, the significant increase in serum cor and the marked decrease in alp in the control group indicated that weaning caused stress in piglets, and the elevation of ast in serum may indicate that the liver was damaged. accordingly, the present results indicated that arg decreased damage to liver tissue after weaning, in comparison to the control group. this is consistent with the results of other studies. for example, the administration of arg reduces damage to liver tissue after ischaemia injury
 <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that arg could protect rats with liver cirrhosis from acute ammonia intoxication
 <cit> .

hsps are intracellular chaperones that play a key role in the recovery from stress and are involved in nearly all intracellular compartments. stress-induced hsp70s function to promote refolding and prevent the aggregation of partially-denatured proteins, as well as tag irreversibly-damaged proteins for proteolysis
 <cit> . arg deprivation decreases hsp expression, and enhances the cellular susceptibility to apoptosis
 <cit> . hsp <dig> could be used as a marker for assessing the biological behavior under stress in vivo
 <cit> . it has been reported that the overexpression of liver hsp <dig>  particularly during the summer, may confer differential effects on cell survival by protecting against changes induced by oxidative stress
 <cit> . our results suggest that arg increased hsp <dig> mrna and protein in the liver. accordingly, immunohistochemistry studies showed differences in hsp <dig> expression. our study demonstrated that the expression of hsp <dig> in the liver was negatively correlated with an increase in the aggressiveness of the histological type. it has also been reported that hsp <dig> levels in the liver were significantly increased in heat-stressed mice that had been administered arg compared with a heat-stress-only group
 <cit> . if we consider the role of hsp <dig> in rna-dna proliferation, these increases may be explained by an increase in cell proliferation and protein synthesis promoted by supplementation with arg
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present results indicated that pretreatment with arg could increase the expression of hsp <dig> in the liver, which might be able to reduce liver injury and enhance liver health in piglets during weaning.
