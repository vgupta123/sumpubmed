BACKGROUND
plasminogen activator inhibitor type- <dig>  is a clade b serine protease inhibitor  that is found as both a  <dig> kda glycoprotein and a non-glycosylated  <dig> kda form  <cit> . both forms efficiently inhibit soluble or receptor-bound urokinase plasminogen activator   <cit>  by the classical serpin inhibitory mechanism resulting in irreversible inhibition of the enzyme  <cit> . the majority of expressed pai- <dig> is not secreted and this may be linked to an inefficient, mildly hydrophobic internal signal peptide  <cit> . thus, whilst pai- <dig> levels in plasma are normally too low to be detected, in conditions such as pregnancy, some myelomonocytic leukemias and in inflammatory tissue, pai- <dig> is consistently detected in plasma and other body fluids as both a glycoprotein and in the  <dig> kda form  <cit> . this suggests a role for pai- <dig> in extracellular protease inhibition in vivo.

we have previously shown that exogenous pai- <dig> efficiently inhibits cell surface upa receptor -bound upa leading to the rapid clearance of the inhibited complex from the cell surface via receptor mediated endocytosis  <cit> . this involves interactions with endocytosis receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor  family leading to delivery of upar/upa/pai- <dig> to endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . tumour overexpression of upa/upar and the related upa inhibitor pai- <dig>  strongly correlates to metastatic potential  <cit>  and poor patient prognosis  <cit> , but the presence of pai- <dig> is associated with benign tumours and increased, relapse-free survival  <cit> . as such, we proposed that the ability of pai- <dig> to remove cell surface upa and hence proteolytic activity, without activation of the pro-mitogenic/motogenic signalling pathways associated with pai- <dig>  <cit> , accounts for the differential prognosis seen for pai- <dig> versus pai- <dig>  <cit> .

therefore, the ability of pai- <dig> to specifically target upa and hence tumour cells without interacting with components of the ecm or modifying other cellular behaviours that may promote tumour cell behaviour   <cit> , supports the use of exogenous pai- <dig> as the basis of upa targeted cancer treatments. promising results using bismuth- <dig> labelled pai- <dig> have been obtained in a number of in vitro, in vivo and preclinical evaluations which show clear cell targeting specificity and tumour efficacy with minimal side effects in relevant animal models  <cit> . these studies used full length wild-type pai- <dig>  but it may be possible to utilise smaller, more easily producible pai- <dig> constructs. this would require validation in terms of its extracellular upa inhibitory and clearance functions.

previous studies have reported the purification of pai- <dig> from placenta  <cit> , cultured human monocytes  <cit> , transfected cho cells  <cit> , baculovirus infected insect larvae  <cit> , yeast  <cit>  and escherichia coli  <cit> . methods of pai- <dig> expression in e. coli have generally utilised a one or two step purification procedure, usually involving metal affinity chromatography and/or ion exchange chromatography. the shift in the literature towards affinity tag based systems for the production of recombinant pai- <dig> constructs  <cit>  allows for the purification of pai- <dig> under milder, native conditions and avoidance of denaturation/renaturation  <cit>  or extreme ph treatment  <cit>  as used previously. the presence of an n-terminal  <dig> × his-tag has previously been shown to have no significant impact on the upa inhibitory activity of pai- <dig>  <cit> . generally, his-tags are believed to have no effect on overall protein structure  <cit> .

an issue associated with the purification of recombinant wild-type pai- <dig> is that pai- <dig> contains a  <dig> amino acid intrahelical loop between alpha helices c and d  which is accessible for cleavage in both e. coli or mammalian expression systems  <cit> . this results in two fractions of recombinant pai- <dig> which retain inhibitory activity but require additional purification steps such as ion-exchange chromatography  <cit> . di giusto et al.  <cit>  showed that  <dig> × his-tagged pai- <dig> lacking the cd-loop  can be purified with a one-step procedure and exhibited identical soluble phase upa inhibitory activity.

the functionality of the cd-loop has been described primarily in an intracellular context and remains somewhat controversial  <cit> . the cd-loop is involved in transglutaminase mediated cross-linking to cellular and ecm proteins  <cit> , although the functional significance of this cross-linking is unknown. interestingly, cross-linked pai- <dig> maintains upa inhibitory activity. the cd-loop is believed to be highly mobile  <cit>  and as such the crystal structure of pai- <dig> has only been resolved for a cd-loop deletion mutant  <cit> .

altogether, this suggests that pai- <dig> Δcd-loop, being easy to produce and purify in addition to retaining upa inhibitory activity, could be used as an exogenous upa targeting substitute for wild-type pai- <dig> in a therapeutic setting. to this end, we compared the expression and purification of  <dig> × his-tagged wild type pai- <dig> and pai- <dig> Δcd-loop and show for the first time that the cell bound upa inhibitory activity and rapid clearance of upar/upa by pai- <dig> is not compromised by the  <dig> × his-tagged form lacking the cd-loop.

RESULTS
expression and purification of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop
expression and purification of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop from both the pet15b and pqe <dig> vector systems yielded a product migrating as a major band at  <dig> kda . this corresponds to the expected molecular weight of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop and was confirmed via western blotting with a monoclonal antibody to pai- <dig> . the pai- <dig> Δcd-loop from the pqe <dig> system contained fewer impurities  compared to pai- <dig> Δcd-loop from pet15b expressed and purified under similar conditions . the abundance of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop expressed and purified from the pqe <dig> versus the pet15b system was found to be ~95% pure compared to ~74%, respectively, as measured by densitometry. the purity of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop was confirmed via hplc, with integration of the elution profile giving pai- <dig> Δcd-loop an abundance of ~95% . the expression and purification of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop using the pqe <dig> system regularly achieved yields between  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l of culture. wild-type pai- <dig> expressed and purified using the pqe <dig> system was less pure  and of lower yield  compared to pai- <dig> Δcd-loop. when visualised by sds-page under reducing conditions, wild-type pai- <dig> yielded two bands that were identified as pai- <dig> via western blotting . this confirms our previous observation that a portion of wild-type pai- <dig> is cleaved in the cd-loop  <cit> , which would require further purification steps to obtain a homogenous protein population.

electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry 
the mass spectrometry data presented here is the first spectrum of any pai- <dig> construct to be published. the esi-ms spectrum of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop  shows a pattern of multiply charged ions  in the m/z range of 2700– <dig> consistent for the  <dig> kda monomeric species. the calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  da is in agreement with the theoretical monoisotopic molecular weight of  <dig>  da. in addition, five higher charge states  from m/z  <dig>  –  <dig>  representing an  <dig> kda dimeric species were also observed. lobov et al.  <cit>  showed that whilst less polymergenic than wild-type pai- <dig>  pai- <dig> Δcd-loop was still able to form dimers and higher order aggregates.

the absence of the cd-loop does not affect the solution phase or cell surface upa activity inhibitory function of pai-2
to ensure that the pai- <dig> Δcd-loop construct generated in this study retained upa inhibitory activity, excess pai- <dig> Δcd-loop was incubated with upa and analysed by sds-page under reducing conditions . a band at ~ <dig> kda was observed corresponding to covalently complexed upa:pai- <dig> Δcd-loop. additionally, western blotting of this complex formation using a monoclonal antibody to upa showed no free upa remained after incubation . pai- <dig> Δcd-loop and wild-type pai- <dig> gave super-imposable kinetic inhibition curves for hmw-upa in solution , confirming that the absence of the cd-loop does not affect upa inhibitory activity of pai- <dig>  di giusto et al.  <cit>  showed that his-tagged pai- <dig> Δcd-loop had the same second order rate constant  as the published wild-type non-recombinant form. moreover, we show that the inhibitory activity of both variants was also identical towards cell surface receptor bound upa as there were no significant differences seen between the two pai- <dig> forms . this indicates that the absence of the cd-loop is also redundant in the more physiological setting of the cell surface. this is to be expected as the majority of serpin sequence deviation occurs in the loops joining secondary structures  <cit> . moreover, the intrahelical cd-loop is a unique feature of clade b serpins  <cit>  which is absent  in inhibitory serpins of all other clades.

removal of the cd-loop does not affect the clearance of upa from the cell surface
preliminary dot-blot analysis suggested that removal of the cd-loop of pai- <dig> has no impact on the interaction between upa complexed pai- <dig> and members of the ldlr family  <cit> . surface plasmon resonance was used to measure the affinity of upa complexed with pai- <dig> Δcd-loop or wild-type pai- <dig> for the endocytosis receptor vldlr. the kd of both upa:pai- <dig> Δcd-loop and upa:wild-type pai- <dig> for vldlr was found to be ~ <dig> nm  and these interaction best fit a 1: <dig> binding model. additionally, no interaction was observed between vldlr and either pai- <dig> Δcd-loop or wild-type pai- <dig> alone . these findings are in agreement with those of croucher et al.  <cit> , which was determined using non-tagged, wild-type pai- <dig>  additionally, when complexed with upa, both wild-type pai- <dig> and pai- <dig> Δcd-loop lead to an almost two-fold increase in the amount of upa endocytosed by mcf- <dig> cells relative those treated with upa alone . importantly, there was no significant difference between cells treated with upa:wild-type pai- <dig> and upa:pai- <dig> Δcd-loop. pre-treatment of cells with the ldlr antagonist rap significantly reduced the amount of upa internalised in all treatments . this also confirms the role of vldlr in endocytosis, as it is the only ldlr family member of relevance on mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> .

values were determined using surface plasmon resonance. binding data was fitted using the biaevaluation  <dig>  software. the binding model chosen represents that with the lowest χ <dig> value. .

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that the cd-loop of pai- <dig> plays no role in the inhibition and clearance of cell surface upa in vitro. additionally, we confirm previous findings indicating that the use of pai- <dig> Δcd-loop is advantageous compared to wild-type pai- <dig> due to superior purity and yield of the recombinant protein under identical conditions. as such, pai- <dig> Δcd-loop appears to present a desirable basis for the development of pai- <dig> based upa targeted cancer therapies. furthermore, tumour uptake increases as protein size is decreased  <cit> , suggesting that this shortened but fully active form of pai- <dig> may not only be simpler to express and purify than wild-type pai- <dig>  but also exhibit a favourable pharmacokinetic profile.
