BACKGROUND
present-day protein sequences can be used to reconstruct ancestral sequences based on a model of sequence evolution. such knowledge about ancestral sequences is helpful for understanding the evolutionary processes as well as the functional aspects of a protein family. existing methods of ancestral sequence reconstruction can be divided into two main categories: maximum parsimony  methods  <cit>  and maximum likelihood  methods  <cit> . mp methods do not take into account biased substitution patterns between amino acids or different tree branch lengths, and cannot distinguish those equally parsimonious reconstructions  <cit> . ml methods do not have these limitations and generally give more reliable results than the mp methods  <cit> . yang et al.  <cit>  first developed a ml method for ancestral sequence reconstruction. yang  <cit>  also made a distinction between "joint" reconstruction and "marginal" reconstruction. joint reconstruction methods intend to find the most likely set of amino acids for all internal nodes at a site, which yields the maximum joint likelihood of the tree  <cit> . marginal reconstruction compares the probabilities of different amino acids at an internal node at a site and selects the amino acid that yields the maximum likelihood for the tree at that site. marginal reconstruction can also compute probabilities of all other amino acids for that node  <cit> . koshi and goldstein  <cit>  developed a fast dynamic programming algorithm for marginal reconstruction in the framework of bayesian statistics, while pupko et al.  <cit>  proposed a fast algorithm for joint reconstruction. the computational complexities for both algorithms scale linearly with the number of sequences. both marginal and joint reconstruction algorithms are implemented in our program.

all reconstruction methods require a phylogenetic tree inferred from a given alignment. the quality of the tree is crucial for the reliability of reconstruction. a number of methods exist for phylogenetic inference, such as maximum likelihood  <cit> , distance-based  <cit>  and parsimony  <cit> . distance-based methods have the advantage of being simple and are able to handle a large set of sequences. they require evolutionary distances estimated for all the sequence pairs. the most common method to infer phylogeny from distances is based on the neighbor-joining algorithm  <cit> . bruno et al.  <cit>  introduced a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction method called "weighbor", i.e. "weighted neighbor joining", which takes into account the fact that errors in distance estimates are larger for longer distances. giving similar results, weighbor is much faster than ml phylogeny reconstruction. it is also better than other methods such as bionj  <cit>  and parsimony  <cit> , in aspects of "long branches attract" and "long branch distracts" problems  <cit> . weighbor is used in our program for phylogenetic inference.

overwhelming evidence exists for substitution rate variation across sites  <cit> . for a protein family, rate heterogeneity reflects the selective pressure imposed by folding, stability and function. gamma distribution is widely used to model the rate variation among sites  <cit>  because of its simplicity. nielsen  <cit>  suggested a method for site-by-site estimation of rate factors by a maximum likelihood approach. rate variation among sites has not been taken into account in the early work of ml reconstruction of ancestral sequences  <cit> . recently, pupko et al.  <cit>  introduced rate variation into joint reconstruction by a branch-and-bound algorithm, assuming a gamma distribution of rates among sites. in our package, two methods are proposed to estimate a rate factor for each site. the first one is based on our observation that the substitution rate at a site is correlated with the conservation of the site. the more conserved the site is in a multiple sequence alignment, the smaller its substitution rate is. this empirical method, the result of which we call alignment-based rate factors or αab, relies only on a multiple sequence alignment and a general model of amino acid exchange. the other one is a maximum likelihood method , which requires a tree. in our implementation, we incorporate αab or αml in the joint and marginal reconstruction algorithms  <cit> . αab is also used in the maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary distances  <cit>  for tree inference.

we implement a method of evolutionary simulation that introduces site-specific rate variations in a natural way by imposing structural and functional constraints  <cit> . we show by simulations that the reconstruction methods can give reasonable results and that the problem of evolutionary distance underestimation  <cit>  is alleviated by considering rate variation across sites.

background  amino acid frequencies  are usually estimated from the target set of sequences or from large databases of protein families. background amino acid frequencies estimated from a small dataset tend to have bias, while amino acid frequencies from large databases may not be suitable for the specific protein family under analysis. here, we propose a ml method to optimize the amino acid frequency vector π. the optimized π vector can give significant improvement over the likelihood of a alignment.

information obtained from ancestral sequence reconstruction is used for two applications: homology detection and prediction of functional sites. for homology detection, ancestral sequences represent an enlargement of the sequence space around native sequences. we demonstrate that adding reconstructed ancestral sequences to a native alignment improves the detection of homologs in database searches.

a number of methods have been developed to predict functional sites from amino acid sequences  <cit> . one simple way to infer functional sites is by positional conservation of a multiple sequence alignment  <cit> . lichtarge et al.  <cit>  proposed a method called evolutionary trace to predict functional sites by analyzing the conservation of sequence subgroups. functional divergence during the evolutionary process can be reflected in the variation of amino acid usage across different functional subgroups. we propose a new approach that uses information from ancestral sequence reconstruction to identify sites that are well conserved within individual sub-trees but exhibit variability among different sub-trees. by several examples, we show that these sites frequently contribute to the functional specificity of a protein family.

RESULTS
we developed a package  to reconstruct ancestral protein sequences considering rate variation among sites. rate factors can be estimated either by an empirical method or by a maximum likelihood method. consideration of rate variation among sites not only improves evolutionary distance estimation, but also gives more accurate ancestral sequence reconstruction. ancestral sequences are used to improve profile-based sequence similarity searches. we also propose a new approach to predict positions with functional specificity based on the reconstruction of ancestral sequences.

observed α, alignment based rate factor α  and rate factor α estimated by maximum likelihood 
evolutionary simulations based on a z-score model introduce rate variation across sites in a natural way by incorporating structural and functional constraints specific for a protein family  <cit> . the simulation procedure is a monte carlo simulation of the amino acid substitution process. the fixation of substitutions is dictated by a simple scoring function, which is derived from the template structure and an alignment of its homologs. the number of substitutions occurring at each site can be recorded during the simulation process and the observed α at a site equals the number of recorded substitutions at that site divided by the average substitution number for all sites. to reduce sampling variance, an average observed α vector is calculated from  <dig> simulations.

for the alignment consisting of all the leaf node sequences generated by the simulation process, an αab vector was calculated according to equation  . an average αab vector was derived from  <dig> simulations. correlation coefficient between the average αab vector and the average observed α vector was high . however, we found that for large observed α values, the corresponding αab values were smaller. a constant β was introduced to correct this underestimation in equation .



here, αi is alignment-based rate factor at site i. k is the number of sites in a given alignment. ci is the value assigned to site i .

we optimized the β value by fitting the average αab vector and average observed α vector to y = x line. alignments for three different protein families  gave a good empirical estimation for β of about  <dig> . the relation between this corrected average αab vector and average observed α vector is shown in figure 1a for a typical example, the pdz domain .

we also estimated an αml vector for each alignment generated from the simulation . the average αml vector shows good correlation with the average observed α vector  . αab or αml can be incorporated in likelihood calculation in marginal or joint reconstruction. table  <dig> shows that improvement of logarithm likelihood of the alignment is significant when αab or αml is used.

the alignment tested here is a subset of sh <dig> family. it includes  <dig> sequences and each sequence contains  <dig> amino acids .

* the likelihood ratio test   <cit>  is used to test whether αab and αml are significantly different from α =  <dig> . the difference in number of free parameters between αab, αml and α =  <dig>  model is  <dig> 

+ cpu times were computed on a dell poweredge  <dig> server .

rate variation across sites can be modeled by assuming that the rate factors follow a certain type of statistical distribution. gamma distribution  <cit>  and its discrete approximations  <cit>  are frequently used for dna or protein sequences. rate variation for a protein family reflects different selective pressure at different sites to maintain structure and function. fewer substitutions are expected to occur in more conserved sites. this hypothesis has prompted us to estimate rate factors  based on sequence conservation in an empirical way. the αab is compared and calibrated using the observed α as standards. our method of estimating αml is similar to the one proposed by nielson  <cit> . one problem with site-by-site rate factor estimation is the small sample size at each site, especially with a small alignment. we have used αab to eliminate outliers with very large αml estimates .

site-specific rate factors improve distance estimation
evolutionary distances tend to be underestimated when rate homogeneity among sites is assumed  <cit> . this was tested using the simulation with structural and functional constraints. for the arbitrarily selected tree shown in figure  <dig>  we obtained leaf node sequences in the simulation and estimated an evolutionary distance for each sequence pair by maximum likelihood, either incorporating αab or setting α equal to  <dig>  ). evolutionary distances were severely underestimated  without considering rate variation among sites . introducing αab in the maximum likelihood method gave more accurate distance estimation , although the distances were still underestimated, especially for small distances . we believe that more accurate distances will give more accurate phylogeny reconstruction using "weighbor"  <cit> . since a tree is required to estimate αml, αml is not incorporated in estimating evolutionary distance.

optimization of equilibrium frequencies
a continuous minimization method by simulated annealing was used to optimize the equilibrium frequency vector π, with the objective function being the logarithm likelihood of the alignment. our π vector optimization program was tested on four alignments, which were taken from the sh <dig> and sh <dig> superfamilies in pfam database   <cit> . two alignments from the sh <dig> superfamily have  <dig> and  <dig> sequences respectively and both alignment lengths are  <dig> amino acids . the other two alignments from sh <dig> superfamily have  <dig> and  <dig> sequences respectively and both alignment lengths are  <dig> amino acids . for each alignment, we ran optimization  <dig> times starting from different random initial points. the optimized π vectors did not converge to exactly the same point, but they had a high correlation with each other  and the difference of logarithm likelihood function values was small . the logarithm likelihood of the alignment, using optimized π vector, increased slightly, but significantly , compared with the logarithm likelihood using the π vector calculated from the alignment.

the alignment tested here is the same alignment used in table  <dig>  calculated π means frequency vector calculated from the alignment.

* the likelihood ratio test   <cit>  is used to test whether optimized π is significantly different from calculated π. the difference in number of free parameters between these two models is  <dig> 

+cpu times were computed on a dell poweredge  <dig> server .

optimization of the π vector is time consuming. the running time for reconstruction with or without optimizing π vector is  <dig>  seconds and  <dig> seconds for sh <dig> alignment , respectively, on a dell poweredge  <dig> server  . in our program, the default π vector is calculated from the alignment while the user has the option to optimize the π vector for ancestral sequence reconstruction.

testing reconstruction
two different methods for simulations of the evolutionary process were used, as described in methods, to test the reliability of the reconstruction results. in the first simulation method, starting from a randomly generated root sequence, we simulated the evolutionary process to obtain leaf node sequences based on a tree and a rate matrix. this process was repeated  <dig> times for a given root sequence r to produce  <dig> alignments consisting of all leaf node sequences. for each of the  <dig> alignments, we used the marginal reconstruction method to obtain an amino acid probability vector for each site at the root. to reduce sampling variance, the amino acid probability vector was averaged over the  <dig> simulation trials. at each site, the amino acid with the highest average probability was chosen as our result of the "reconstructed amino acid" at that site. all "reconstructed amino acids" formed the reconstructed sequences r'. there is no difference between r and r', that is, the accuracy of reconstruction is 100% for the tree shown in figure  <dig>  for each individual simulation and its reconstruction, we checked the amino acid with the highest probability in the reconstructed probability vector of the root. if it is indeed the "reconstructed amino acid", the prediction for that simulation is correct according to the average reconstructed results. the fraction of individual predictions that are correct according to the average reconstructed results is almost always higher than the average probability of the "reconstructed amino acid", suggesting that the average probability of the "reconstructed amino acid" gives a lower estimation of the reconstruction reliability .

for the second simulation method, we introduced rate heterogeneity across sites with structural and functional constraints  <cit> . for the same tree, the accuracy of reconstruction was about 90%. sites with larger substitution rates are expected to have less reliable reconstructions. figure 4b shows the relationship between the average αab and the fraction of individual predictions that are correct according to the "reconstructed amino acid". sites with incorrect "reconstructed amino acids" all have large αab values. these values reflect the difficulty of reconstructing sites with large numbers of substitutions. the probabilities of the "reconstructed amino acids" are all small for sites with incorrect reconstructions , suggesting that the information content of the reconstruction is low.

the second simulation method was also used to test ancescon along with the reconstruction programs from paml  <cit> , phylip  <cit>  and paup*  <cit> . all tree topologies used in reconstruction tests were inferred from real alignments. all original root sequences were taken from pdb database  <cit> . we had three different types of alignment testing sets. the first testing set used the same tree topology but different root sequences to generate  <dig> alignments . the second testing set used the same root sequence but different tree topologies. the third testing set randomly selected a root sequence and a tree topology to generate  <dig> alignments. after  <dig> alignments were generated, we reconstructed the root sequence for each alignment and found the consensus root sequence for the  <dig> reconstructed root sequences. finally, the consensus root sequence was compared with the original root sequence to calculate the reconstruction accuracy, i.e. the fraction of correctly reconstructed sites for the root sequence. in addition, for the third test, the paired t-test was used to calculate the one-tail probability between ancescon and other three methods. in order to make different tree topologies comparable, those trees were scaled to make the average distance from root to all leaf nodes  the same for all trees and equal to the tree of pii <dig>  . if da was too small , the reconstruction accuracy was always close to  <dig> for all reconstruction methods used. the value da =  <dig>  was large enough to generate diverse sequences to differentiate  <dig> different ancestral sequence reconstruction methods.

for ancescon we had  <dig> different parameter settings, which included site-specific rate factors estimated by maximum likelihood method , alignment-based rate factors  and no rate factors . different parameters were also used for the reconstruction programs from paml and phylip to find their best reconstructions. for paml, reconstruction was tested with parameter α  estimated from alignment and without α. for phylip,  <dig> different parameter settings were tried, which were combinations of with/without α estimated from alignment by paml and with/without branch length dwelling in input tree topology. for paup*, default settings were used.

all root sequences are taken from pdb database and the names listed in the table are pdb ids.

ancestral sequences used in homology detection
thirty-eight ob -fold  <cit>  proteins and ten other alignments  from the pfam database   <cit>  were chosen to perform homology detection tests.

given an alignment with n sequences, we had four different methods, "best", "second best", "shuffle" and "random", to generate another n- <dig> sequences . for each combined alignment , psi-blast  <cit>  searches were performed starting from each sequence and seeded with the combined alignment , and all found hits were pooled together.

the benchmark experiment was psi-blast seeded with the native alignment . for each type of the four combined alignments, we checked hits not found by the native alignments. new hits were verified to be true positives or false positives by running psi-blast or hmmer  <cit> , followed by manual inspections.

using the  <dig> native alignments, a total of  <dig> hits were found by the benchmark. compared to the benchmark, the "best" method detected  <dig> new homologs and the other three methods found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> new homologs, respectively . among those new homologs, "best", "second best", "shuffle" and "random" methods had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> false positives, respectively . also, "best", "second best", "shuffle" and "random" methods missed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> homologs as compared to the benchmark.

adding non-native sequences to the native alignment results in a change of sequence profile for psi-blast searches. random sequences can dilute the position-specific amino acid exchange characteristics of native alignments. this effect should not improve the profile. indeed, few new homologs are found by the "random" method. however, sequences generated by shuffling each position of the native alignment have the same conservation properties as the native alignment, and the "shuffle" method detects a total of  <dig> new homologs. two effects may account for this finding. first, addition of shuffled sequences to the native alignment can slightly change the estimates of pseudocount frequencies of amino acids and thus the position specific scoring matrix  <cit> . second, the new version of psi-blast program uses composition-based statistics with e-value estimation related to the composition of the query sequence  <cit> . each shuffled sequence has its own amino acid composition that is different from the native sequences. this difference can affect the e-values of hits. the "best" method detects the most number of new homologs, suggesting that the reconstructed ancestral sequences resemble the native sequences. ancestral sequences may therefore be more similar to some remote homologs than to the native sequences. the "second best" method detects less new homologs than the "best" method but more than the "random" method, suggesting that the second most probable amino acids in reconstruction can still reflect some properties of native sequences. table  <dig> shows homology detection results of ob-fold structures using reconstructed ancestral sequences.

prediction of functional sites
ten well-studied protein families  from the pfam database   <cit>  were selected to test the prediction of functional sites. to define functional sites, we considered residues falling within 5Å of any ligand to be functionally important . as a simple quantification of prediction accuracy, we counted the number of predictions that lie within 5Å from the ligands and consider these sites to be true positives.

our method intends to identify those sites with high similarity within individual sub-trees and high variation among sub-trees. these sites are likely to contribute to functional specificity. based on a tree partition and the reconstructions at the cutting nodes , we have developed a measure called specificity score ). we expect that both highly variable sites and highly conserved sites tend to score low in our method. ten top-ranking sites were selected as our predicted functional sites for each family. for comparison, we also implemented a simple conservation  method  <cit> , the evolutionary trace  method  <cit>  and the conservation difference  method  <cit>  on the  <dig> protein families. the results are shown in table  <dig>  here, the results from these three methods tend to include invariant or highly conserved sites while the result from our method scores those sites low. still, the number of true positives of our method is comparable to other methods for several families. for some protein families, such as gef, pdz and subtilase, our method predicts no fewer functional residues than the other three methods.

another example is the family of adenylyl kinases. our method identified  <dig> residues within  <dig> Å to the ligand while the other  <dig> methods identified more such residues, most of which are in highly conserved positions such as the catalytic residues. highly conserved residues, however, are not selected by our method since our measure is designed to emphasize on sites contributing to specificity. figure  <dig> shows the n-terminal part of the alignment of adenylyl kinases, with our predictions highlighted in red and orange colors. the evolutionary tree for the alignment is shown in figure  <dig>  the first cutting layer  results in two well-separated sub-trees. functional annotations suggest that they contain enzymes with different substrate preferences: adenylyl kinases and uridylate kinases, respectively. three residues  from our predictions  contribute to substrate-binding specificity, as have been noted before in the structural studies of the ump kinases  <cit> . figure  <dig> highlights our predicted functional residues on the adenylyl kinase protein structure. most of our predictions fall within the specificity pocket.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a package  to reconstruct ancestral protein sequences that takes into account the variation of substitution rates among sites. two methods were proposed to estimate site-specific evolutionary rates , namely alignment-based rate factor  and rate factor α estimated by maximum likelihood . consideration of rate variation among sites can alleviate the underestimation of evolutionary distances. accuracy of ancestral sequence reconstruction by our method is higher than that of paml, phylip and paup* when the given alignment contains more diverse sequences. we show that reconstructed ancestral sequences help to improve detection of distant homologs and prediction of functional sites with specificity.
