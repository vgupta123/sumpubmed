BACKGROUND
genetical genomics as a new approach which combines gene-expression data and marker genotypes in a segregating population, offers great perspectives to make a major contribution to the dissection of complex traits  <cit> . genetical genomics aims at detecting genomic loci that control variation in gene expression, so-called expression qtl ). the detected eqtl can represent a locus that lies close to the gene that is being controlled  or one or more loci that are unlinked to the gene that is being controlled   <cit> . expression-qtl for genes showing high correlation with the phenotype may provide the necessary information required for identifying genes that control quantitative phenotypes. those cis-eqtls resulting from the correlation of expression profiles with phenotypic measurements represent candidate genes for the genetic regulation underlying the variation of the physiological traits  <cit> .

we have previously reported on the identification of eqtl of genes showing expression levels correlated with waterholding capacity of meat measured as drip loss  <cit> . here in this study, we expand and up-dated the analysis towards global eqtl mapping of transcripts showing variable abundance in porcine muscle and using annotation and localisation data of affymetrix microarray probe-sets based on the current porcine sequence information  <cit> . we focus on eqtl of genes whose expression at slaughter is significantly correlated to technological meat quality traits addressed in commercial pig breeding schemes. taking into account own observations on the reliability of eqtl mapping we highlight eqtl located on the same chromosome as the corresponding genes themselves  <cit> .

RESULTS
summary analysis of eqtl detection
expression data were obtained from m. longissimus dorsi samples of  <dig> f <dig> animals of a resource population using affymetrix porcine genome arrays containing in total  <dig>  probe-sets of which  <dig>  probe-sets were assigned to a known gene  <cit> . mas <dig> analysis revealed consistent 'present calls' for  <dig>  probe-sets. this pre-selected set was further analyzed with the more sophisticated hybrid algorithm plier  <cit>  and the expression levels were subjected to linkage analysis. out of  <dig>  probe-sets  <dig>  showed at least one eqtl at the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold  corresponding approximately to the suggestive linkage threshold proposed by lander & kruglyak  <cit>  . in total, the  <dig>  probe-sets revealed  <dig>  eqtl at lod score >  <dig> ,  <dig>  eqtl at lod score >  <dig>  and  <dig> eqtl at lod score >  <dig>  only  <dig> had eqtl with lod score >  <dig>  this yielded an average of  <dig>  eqtl per transcript . the eqtl were distributed over all autosomes with some regions harboring particularly many eqtl with high significance . out of the  <dig>  eqtl  <dig>  eqtl could be assigned to the porcine genome sequence . in total  <dig> eqtl were mapped on the same chromosome as the corresponding gene itself. these eqtl are putative cis-eqtl.

integration of trait, expression, and mapping data to identify genes related to the meat quality
in order to link the eqtl to the genetic background of a classical phenotypic trait of interest, it is necessary to establish a relationship between the variation of that classical phenotypic trait, the expression levels of various transcripts, and the mapping position of the eqtl and the corresponding transcripts. therefore, we selected transcripts whose expression level showed significant correlation with individual meat quality traits and with the composite traits, pc <dig> and pc <dig>   and we focussed on those transcripts with eqtl on their own chromosome as the structurally fixed linkage group . out of  <dig> eqtl that were mapped on the chromosome of their corresponding genes  <dig> transcripts showed correlation with at least one meat quality trait. these are displayed in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the linkage map showed accurate match of microsatellites marker order with the marker arrangement in the current porcine genome sequence assembly . a total of  <dig> out  <dig> microsatellites marker were found to align on the porcine genome sequence assembly map position by blast analysis. reflecting this alignment, the position of  <dig> transcripts in the porcine physical map was assigned to the corresponding eqtl position in the genetic linkage maps. most of the eqtl of transcripts whose expression level correlated with meat quality traits were found on ssc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig> summarizes the number of eqtl related to various meat quality traits.

most of these meat quality parameters were correlated or dependent on each other. such correlations were reported by many studies  <cit> . in a previous study we used principle components  to reduce the multi dimensional data sets into lower dimensions  <cit> . the principal component  is a meat quality vector and has high loadings for ph24ld, ph24st and meat color which are inversely correlated with drip loss. the principal component  is also a meat quality vector with large positive contribution of conductivity  and negative contribution of ph1ld. in order to scale down the list of  <dig> putative cis-eqtl for meat quality, transcript levels of genes correlated with the two pcs with high loadings of meat quality traits were considered. the level of expression of  <dig> and  <dig> probe-sets, respectively, were correlated with the new composite traits that were generated by principal component analysis pc <dig> and pc <dig> . in order to unravel the composite traits, the correlation of these  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts with each single meat quality trait contributing to the pc was screened and traits with significant correlations with the respective genes are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  thus the probe-sets represent a subset of probe-sets correlated with individual meat quality traits. as previously shown, analyses of enrichment of functional annotation groups as defined in the gene ontology , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases, or in the ingenuity pathways analysis library, highlight ubiquitination, phosphorylation, mitochondrion dysfunction, actin-, integrin-, pdgf-, egf-, vegf-, and ca-signalling pathways  <cit> . most of the eqtl related to pc <dig> were found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and 6; for pc <dig> on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

discussion
complex traits are genetically controlled by many loci. the identification of candidate genes for these traits is widely based on the principle of 'collecting evidences' in order to prioritize genes for further analysis from the huge lists of functional and positional candidate genes. the detection of eqtl provides information about the positional aspects of gene expression regulation. together with the growing knowledge of genome sequences and gene annotation, this gives insight into the architecture of regulatory networks. in order to relate eqtl analysis to the genetic background of any complex trait, either a positional link to qtl for the complex trait of interest  and/or a functional link to the trait expression is required. here we report on the detection of eqtl for some  <dig>  transcripts found in porcine skeletal muscle by microarray analysis. we demonstrate that the global microarray eqtl analysis can serve for narrowing down the candidate genes for quantitative traits related to meat quality when it is integrated with the analysis of the correlation of expression levels with the traits of interest.

the genetic architecture of transcript level variation in the porcine f <dig> resource population was highly variable and complex. eqtl were detected for 53% of the  <dig>  probe-sets, with many of them exhibiting more than one eqtl summing up to more than  <dig> eqtl in total . the expression levels of the majority of the transcripts showed quantitative variation. so the transcript levels are probably quantitatively controlled. the link between the linkage maps and porcine assembly sequence enable discriminating cis or trans-eqtl. all  <dig>  probe-sets sequence represented on the porcine microarray and the microsatellites sequences were blasted against the ensembl porcine bac sequence . our microsatellite order showed high accuracy compared to the ensembl porcine bac sequence.

correlations between transcript abundance and meat quality, combined with genetic positional information of eqtl allowed us to prioritize a small number of candidate genes. we considered transcripts, which exhibited expression levels correlated with meat quality traits, and which had eqtl on the same chromosome as the transcripts itself.

our previous studies showed that cis regulation is a stable characteristic of individual transcripts. consequently, a global microarray eqtl analysis of a limited number of samples can be used for exploring functional and regulatory gene networks and scanning for cis-eqtl. in particular, the assignment of eqtl to chromosomes is reliable; though some cis-eqtl change their position, they were consistently assigned to the same chromosome when comparing analyses based on  <dig> microarrays or  <dig> real time rt-pcrs  <cit> . based on this observation, we decided to highlight only eqtl which were located on the gene itself or the same chromosome. moreover, this relaxed measure was chosen in order to avoid the exclusion of any true cis-acting eqtl that are not precisely mapped, because of the limited resolution of the genetic map. the observation that cis-eqtl were more consistently detected than trans-eqtl was also made by comparing the results from different studies of eqtl with different numbers of animals and different tissue types  <cit> .

expression qtl mapping, with its potential to categorize cis and trans-effects, provides the mean to discriminate between "effect" and "cause" with respect to trait-associated differential expression. though a relaxed window of cis-eqtls was used, a low proportion of 10% of putative cis-eqtl was found in this study, compared to other previous studies  <cit> . cis-regulated genes are of interest, because the underlying genes are expected to harbour genetic variants that influence their own expression level, which may also influence the physiological traits of interest, if transcript abundance is correlated with the target phenotype  <cit> . this provides a function-related evidence of the candidacy of a particular gene.

the usefulness of eqtl for identification of quantitative trait genes was demonstrated  <cit> . the causal link between sequence variation, gene expression, and phenotype arises because the polymorphism might be responsible for both a cis-eqtl and the qtl contributing to a quantitative phenotype, so called pqtl. qtl for traits related to meat quality were previously mapped in the population used here  <cit> . the matching of pqtl, eqtl and the localization of the corresponding genes with trait-correlated expression provides positional and functional evidence for the potential role of the respective genes and strongly promote them as candidate genes. mapping of eqtl enables displaying regulatory networks and localizing genomic variation affecting the mrna expression of a gene either within the genes itself  or distant from the gene . the key advantage of eqtl mapping is that it connects variation at the level of rna expression to variation at the level of dna. only the latter provides versatile tools for breeding whereas the first reveals information on the biology of a trait and directs to new candidate genes. moreover, integration of  information on qtl for a trait of interest in breeding  with analysis of  trait correlated expression and with  mapping of expression qtl  for the corresponding trait-dependent-regulated genes facilitates the identification of genes and pathways with cumulative evidence of their involvement in the biology of the traits of interest and enable to built priority lists of candidate genes  <cit> . however, there are also some issues that limit of the use of the genetical genomics approach, in particular the resolution of the genetic maps that is depending on the number of markers and animals used and the structure of the population used and artifacts caused by the limited sensitivity and specificity of microarray experiments  <cit> .

in a previous study we used the principle components with high loadings of meat quality traits to identify functional networks of genes and to gain knowledge of biological and physiological processes taking place during the conversion of muscle to meat  <cit> . here in this study, we combined principle component analysis of traits related to meat quality with eqtl to scale down the list of candidate genes for the traits.

CONCLUSIONS
holistic expression profiling was integrated with qtl analyses for meat quality traits. this is, to our knowledge, the first report of a comprehensive scan for cis-eqtl associated with meat quality traits in the pig. correlations between transcript abundance and meat quality traits, combined with genetic positional information of eqtl allowed us to prioritise candidate genes for further study. accordingly, a list of candidate genes for meat quality was set up. the further identification of the causative polymorphisms and the determination of their functional role are even more challenging, since there are several different molecular mechanisms through which mrna levels in cells can be regulated.
