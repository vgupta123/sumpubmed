BACKGROUND
venezuelan equine encephalitis virus  is an alphavirus in the family togaviridae. it causes a highly virulent central nervous system  disease in horses and other equines and is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. outbreaks of veev have been reported at intervals of  <dig> to  <dig> years in south and central america and in the texas region of north america, which has resulted in veev being included on the list of emerging pathogens  <cit> . veev has also been developed as a bio-warfare agent, making its use more likely than other non-weaponized agents in the event that a bio-weapon or bio-terrorism agent is used  <cit> . there is no specific treatment available for veev. a vaccine for prophylaxis against veev is under investigational new drug status and is given to personnel at risk of occupational exposure to veev. this vaccine has several limitations and has not been licensed by the fda. veev infection in mice induces the bi-phasic disease observed in equines and lethal human infections  thus making it a good model to study veev pathogenesis  <cit> . veev spreads from the site of inoculation through the locally draining lymph nodes, causes viremia, and disseminates to other lymphoid organs  <cit> . viremia is followed by a cns phase of disease  <cit> . veev enters into the cns primarily through the olfactory neuroepithelium, via brain capillary endothelial cells and the trigeminal nerve  <cit> . in the cns, veev infects neurons and glial cells and causes subsequent cellular degeneration. infection with veev results in neuronal cell death, active gliosis and an intense inflammatory response characterized by perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration  <cit> . however, in another subset of dying neurons associated with astrogliosis, no veev antigen can be found, indicating an alternate, indirect mechanism of neuronal degeneration  <cit> .

as the mechanism underlying the inflammatory and immune response to veev infection in brain and subsequent neurodegenration are poorly understood, it is important to characterize the underlying cellular and molecular pathways. to fulfill this objective we used the virulent neuroinvasive strain, v <dig>  of veev. gene expression changes in veev-infected mouse brain were studied using microarrays containing  <dig>  oligonucleotides, representing  <dig>  genes. we demonstrate that with the progression of disease both the total number of genes and fold expression of numerous genes increased. many of the changes were associated with important immune pathways such as antigen presentation, inflammation, apoptosis and viral response. gene expression changes were validated by rt-pcr. pathologic changes in the brain were documented by h&e  and immunohistochemistry .

RESULTS
survival of animals post veev infection
mice began showing roughening of fur and hunched back at day  <dig> post infection. by day  <dig>  animals were lethargic and at least one mouse had hind limb paralysis. one animal died on day  <dig> post infection and all other animals showed little or no movement. all the mice died by day  <dig> post infection. mortality was 100% with mean survival time of  <dig>  days. animal mortality is documented in table  <dig> 

mice were infected with  <dig> pfu of v <dig> in left rear foot pad at day  <dig> and were monitored for the clinical symptoms of disease thereafter. all the animals exhibited hind limb paralysis, a hallmark of veev infection and succumbed to disease by day  <dig> post infection. mortality was 100% with a mean survival time of  <dig>  days.

histopathology and immunohistochemistry for veev antigen
veev antigen-specific staining showed the presence of viral antigen within neurons and glial cells in the olfactory and prefrontal areas of the brain at  <dig> hr post infection. many more veev infected neurons and glial cells were present throughout the brain at  <dig> hr post infection. veev antigen was present throughout the brain at  <dig> hr post infection and the degree of inflammation corresponded to the density of virus infected cells. inflammation started with perivascular cuffing and localizaton to the meninges at  <dig> hr post infection. at  <dig> hr post infection, inflammation was observed in the olfactory and frontal area of the brain. by  <dig> hr post-infection inflammation was extensive and had spread throughout the brain .

gene expression analysis
microarrays were performed using rna extracted from veev-infected mouse brain at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post infection and gene expression profile were compared with rna extracted from saline infected control mice at similar time points. all the biological replicates  shared significant homology in gene expression . mean fold-expression of biological replicates ≥  <dig>  fold over control was determined to be significant. as shown in table  <dig>  the number of genes upregulated in brain increased as disease progressed . at  <dig> hr post infection the maximum numbers of total genes were upregulated at ≥  <dig>  fold levels in mouse brain.

total rna extracted from veev infected brain was analyzed by microarray as described in methods. gene's upregulated ≥ <dig>  folds were considered. number of genes over expressed increased as the disease progressed with maximum genes over expressed at  <dig> hr post infection.

to analyze similarities and difference in gene expression between brains at different time points, hierarchical clustering analysis was done for all genes at the four time points. genes which showed a distinct pattern of over-expression with the time of veev infection are shown in fig  <dig>  all genes were grouped in two clusters. the first cluster contained genes upregulated at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr, whereas the second cluster contained genes upregulated at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post infection. this analysis clearly distinguished the changes in the gene expression profile with the progression of veev infection. some genes related to the inflammatory response, such as cxcl <dig>  clu and antigen presentation, such as b2m, fcer1g showed over-expression only at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection .

functional analysis of over-expressed genes was performed using the goffa  library of the arraytrack software. genes belonging to various biological processes were grouped together. based on these analyses, a majority of genes  were identified to play a role in different biological processes at  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr,  <dig> hr, and  <dig> hr post infection, respectively. these genes were further categorized by the various functions that may play an important role in veev pathogenesis  as follows:

i) virus response genes
it has been shown that interferon and interferon-inducible genes play an important role in the immune response towards viral pathogens. consistent with this information, several interferon-inducible genes were upregulated  in present study. these include ifi <dig>  ifih <dig>  irf <dig> and oas1b which were upregulated at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post infection except becn <dig> that was over-expressed only at  <dig> hr post infection, and spn which was over-expressed at all time points.

genes that are involved in the virus response and immune response were upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection concomitant with the virus appearance in the brain. several inflammatory response and antigen presentation genes were upregulated and their expression increased with the progression of the disease. values are fold changes in the gene expression in test samples over saline controls. values are expressed as mean ± sem. ne indicates not expressed or expression was lower than  <dig> fold  ne indicates not expressed and '-' indicates not expressed in biological replicates.

ii) inflammatory response genes
inflammation constitutes an important part of the immune response towards the invading pathogen. in veev infection, inflammation in brain is implicated in the secondary neuronal damage leading to morbidity and mortality. several genes related to the inflammatory response were upregulated in the brain following veev infection, mostly at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection . most importantly, chemokine genes e.g., cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> that exert a chemotactic signal for the immune cell migration to the site of the injury were upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection. these gene expression correlates with the increased neutrophil infiltration in brain and blood brain barrier  compromise . in addition inflammatory genes e.g., fcer1g, and mif were also over-expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection. 

iii) genes involved in antigen presentation 
resident glial cells of the brain are known to act as antigen presenting cells and constitute an important part of the immune response against a virus pathogen. several major histocompatibility complex  class ii genes e.g., h2-d <dig>  h2-d <dig> h2-q <dig> and h2-t <dig> were upregulated at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post infection, concomitant with veev antigen appearance in the brain. mhc class i receptors such as cd1d <dig>  b2m and ap3d <dig> were also upregulated at  <dig> hr post infection. 

iv) apoptotic gene expression
apoptotic neurons were seen in the veev-infected mouse brain in regions associated with veev antigen and the regions of gliosis that are free of veev antigen. several apoptotic genes such as caspase recruitment domain  <dig>  fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule  <dig>  apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase , eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig>  and myeloid cell leukemia sequence  <dig>  were upregulated at  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post infection . few genes, like amyloid beta  precursor protein , bcl2/adenovirus e1b interacting protein 3-like , baculoviral iap repeat-containing  <dig>  and spn were upregulated throughout the study and few others such as amyloid beta  precursor-like protein  <dig> , clusterin , integral membrane protein 2b , and valosin containing protein , were upregulated as early as  <dig> hr post infection .

genes that are modulated in the apoptotic response were upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection concomitant with the virus appearance in the brain. values are fold changes in the gene expression in test samples over saline controls. values are expressed as mean ± sem. ne indicates not expressed or expression was lower than  <dig> fold  and  indicates not expressed in biological replicates.

apart from over-expressed genes, few genes were down-regulated  at all time points. those genes are listed in supplementary table  <dig>  as expected, the functional analysis showed genes related to several cellular physiological processes such as cell transport  cell cycle/division , cellular metabolism  and other cellular processes  were down-regulated in veev infection.

confirmation of gene expression
randomly selected genes identified in the microarrays were analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis in 3– <dig> biological replicates. specific amplification was confirmed by sequencing pcr products as described in materials and methods . as shown in fig  <dig>  the expression of genes oas1b, fcre1g and clu was up-regulated in mouse brain infected with veev. although rt-pcr analysis was not quantitative, consistent with microarray analysis, gene expression of fcer1g, oas1b and clu was higher at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection as compared to saline control and  <dig> hr post infection 

discussion
the proximal cause of death following veev infection is attributed to the host immune response to replicating virus resulting in lethal encephalitis  <cit> . therefore, it is important to study the kinetics of changes in gene expression in the brain of the veev infected host to understand the resulting immune response and to identify potential therapeutic targets and markers for treatment of veev infection. in the present study, total rna isolated from mouse brain was used. this consisted of rna from all the cell types present in the veev infected mouse brain. the goal of the study was to characterize the overall molecular frame work of gene expression in the brain. in this way, the changes in gene expression could be directly correlated with the tissue pathology. since different cell types, individually, may respond differently to veev infection it is imperative to study the overall gene expression patterns during disease progression in tissue containing all the relevant cells.

consistent with the histopathological changes, microarray analysis showed over-expression of the genes involved in the various immune responses towards the pathogen. for example oas1b, ifi <dig>  ifih <dig> and irf <dig> genes were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hr post infection. elevated level of oas1b has been shown to inhibit west nile virus  replication by reducing the positive strand viral rna level in cells  <cit> . since veev is a positive single strand rna virus, increased oas1b levels may also potentially inhibit veev replication. the anti-veev activity of interferon  and interferon regulatory factor  is also well established  <cit> . ifn α/β knockout mice showed increased and early spread of veev into brain, and irf <dig> knockout mice showed increased susceptibility to otherwise avirulent strains of veev  <cit> .

the ability of microglia, the brain's resident macrophage, to present antigen associated with mhc class ii to t cells, allows these normally quiescent cells to play a critical role in shaping the outcome of many neurological diseases  <cit> . activated glial cells are observed in the brains of veev-infected mice  <cit> . consistent with these reported observations, upregulated mhc class ii loci genes such as h2-d <dig>  h2-d <dig> h2-q <dig> and h2-t <dig> in the present study may reflect the activated state of glial cells in the brain of veev infected mice. several molecules associated with mhc-i-mediated presentation such as b2m, fcerg <dig> and cd1d <dig> were also upregulated in our study. beta  <dig> microglobulin  was also upregulated in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome encephalitis and jc virus infection of the cns  <cit> . fc-receptors are important in antigen processing/presentation of myelin proteins during the autoimmune response in the cns  <cit>  and contribute to inflammatory damage in the cns. cd1d <dig> plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine production after an acute virus infection  <cit> . thus, in the current study, veev infection in mice induces a similar host immune response as observed with other viruses.

veev infection of the cns has been shown to result in neurodegeneration, perivascular cuffing with infiltrating lymphocytes, gliosis, cerebral edema and apoptotic neurons associated with astrogliosis in the regions of the brain which is free of veev antigen  <cit> . therefore, it is not clear whether veev is directly or indirectly involved with these changes. to understand this phenomenon we investigated whether the expression of chemokines, cytokines and other inflammatory genes is altered in veev infected brain. interestingly, chemokines such as cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  fc-receptor such as fcer1g, and mif genes were upregulated. these chemokines may contribute to the influx of neutrophils and lymphocytes as observed in the brain  and the severity of the encephalitis during veev infection. fc-receptor,fcerg <dig> may contribute in veev antigen presentation to t cells and induction of inflammatory cytokines. the cytokine expression at the site of inflammation is suggested to be the outcome of interaction of glucocorticoids and macrophage migration inhibitory factor   <cit> . though over-expressed in the microarray, only a marginal increase in expression of mif was observed at  <dig> hr post infection by pcr, where increases in inflammation and neutrophil migration were also observed.

several apoptosis related genes were also upregulated.clusterin , an anti-apoptotic factor, activates microglia to secrete neurotoxic agents  <cit> . clu-activated microglia showed increased mhc class ii expression, secreted reactive nitrogen intermediates and tnf-α  <cit> . veev infection of the brain also results in the activation of microglia  <cit>  and thus clu may contribute to the gliosis observed in veev pathogenesis. the caspase recruitment domain  is a protein-binding module that mediates the assembly of card-containing proteins into apoptosis and nfκb signaling complexes  <cit> . card <dig>  a membrane-associated guanylate kinase  family member containing card has been implicated in the antigen-specific signaling by the tcr complex via bcl10-mediated nfκb activation  <cit> . in our study, card <dig> upregulation was concomitant with the increased inflammation and enhancement in apoptotic neurons. card <dig> may be involved in the veev antigen-initiated signaling in lymphocytes or glial cells and/or in the apoptotic pathways in neurons. faim <dig> inhibits fas-mediated apoptosis and helps in protecting foreign antigen-specific b cells during potentially hazardous interactions with fasl-bearing t cells  <cit> . faim <dig> was upregulated following veev infection and may be involved in the activation and survival of immune cells in the brain. the paradoxical findings on the over-expression of pro-apoptotic card  <dig> and anti-apoptotic faim <dig> may be due to their expression by different cell population in the brain.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show a complex immune response to veev infection. several pathways seem to interact for the final outcome of the disease. thus, suppression of the inflammatory response and enhancement of the antiviral pathways may help in reducing the severity of the disease. we have identified several genes e.g., chemokines, oas1b, fcerg <dig>  mif and clu which may provide potential targets for therapy against veev infection in the future.
