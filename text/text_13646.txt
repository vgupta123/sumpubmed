BACKGROUND
the renin-angiotensin system  is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and extracellular volume in the body. the ras sequentially processes angiotensinogen to angiotensin ii , a peptide hormone that is a potent vasoconstrictor. inhibition of ras components has been used successfully in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and end organ damage. renin catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the ras cascade and renin is specific for angiotensinogen. blockade of ang ii production by direct inhibition of renin has long been a therapeutic goal. early renin inhibitors, such as enalkiren and remikiren, were effective in blood pressure lowering. however, due to poor oral bioavailability, duration of action, and high costs of synthesis, these early peptidomimetic inhibitors never progressed to pivotal clinical studies  <cit> . continued clinical interest in renin has led to the recent approval of the first renin inhibitor, aliskiren , a non-peptidic inhibitor of renin, which has generated an interest in finding newer renin inhibitors with improved profiles.

renin is a member of the aspartic acid protease family. the human renin gene encodes for a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids. it is proteolytically processed and secreted as a  <dig> residue zymogen, prorenin, which contains a  <dig> amino acid propeptide. the propeptide serves as an autoinhibitory domain that controls the enzyme activity. the pro segment must be removed to generate mature, fully active renin. prorenin is synthesized principally by juxtaglomerular cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole of the kidney and is released into the bloodstream.

renin was first purified from animal tissues, including submaxillary glands and kidneys. yields were generally very low. for instance, yokosawa et al  <cit>  obtained only  <dig> μg of pure renin from  <dig> kg of non-cancerous autopsied human kidneys. using recombinant techniques, renin has been expressed and purified from eukaryotic cell lines including cho cells <cit> , mouse l- <dig> cells, sf <dig> insect cells  <cit>  and damp cells  <cit> . active renin had also been over-expressed in escherichia coli and successfully refolded  <cit> . in order to supply enzyme to support our structure-based design efforts, we developed an efficient system for renin production and purification in amounts sufficient to support routine x-ray crystallography. herein, we report a simple procedure for renin expression and purification that exploits the affinity of glycosylated renin for con a. generally, multi-milligram quantities of material can be prepared from the conditioned medium of hek cell culture. the active renin protein prepared has been used successfully to support activity assays and to generate high resolution crystal complexes with bound inhibitors.

RESULTS
the recombinant human renin gene was transfected into the human kidney cell line, hek- <dig>  a clonal cell line expressing significant levels of prorenin was prepared by limiting dilution. analysis of the conditioned media of multiple clones identified a single clone that was scaled and transferred to growth in a hollow fiber bioreactor. this line was subsequently adapted to growth in serum free media. the recombinant human prorenin was constitutively secreted into the medium with concomitant removal of the  <dig> aminoacid long n-terminal signal peptide . although serum-free medium was used to grow the cells, the small amounts of other proteins  were found as contaminants.

prorenin has two n-linked glycosylation sites  and . the glycosylated prorenin has reasonable affinity for con a and this interaction was used to purify the protein to high purity in a single step. to our surprise, the major contaminating protein, bsa, did not bind to the con a resin. the bovine serum had been used in the culture medium initially when the cell line was adapted to the serum-free medium and bsa was a major component. therefore, the con a chromatography is more like a step of prorenin enrichment and any major contaminants were removed subsequently with cation exchange chromatography.

after the hollow fiber bioreactor system was set up for the prorenin expression, the conditioned medium was collected, about  <dig> ml a day, which was pooled and loaded onto the con a column. for one typical manageable purification experiment, 250– <dig> ml containing approximately  <dig> mg proteins was used. the column was washed until the baseline was stabilized. in order to improve the yields, the column was "soaked and then eluted" with the buffer containing d-methyl-mannopyranoside at the low flow rate. usually, two or three cycles of the soaking/eluting were applied in order to maximize the recovery. the volume of the pooled materials containing mainly prorenin  was reduced to approximately  <dig> ml by the millipore ultrafiltration device, followed by activation and further purification . no other detectable endogenous con a binding proteins were observed by coomasie stained sds-page gels.

the con a material was converted to active renin by digestion with trypsin. trypsin cleaves after residue arg <dig>  conditions were optimized using different temperature, time and amounts of trypsin. the final conditions were described in the experimental section and provide mild proteolysis for quantitative conversion of prorenin to active renin . prolonged trypsin treatment did not appear to result in any internal cleavage of the protein, and generally one hour incubation at 4°c with trypsin afforded a complete conversion from prorenin to renin indicating that the propeptide trypsin-cleavage site was accessible.

after digestion, trypsin was removed with trypsin-inhibitor agarose beads. any other contaminants or misfolded renin proteins were removed with cation exchange chromatography . approximately 60–70% of the total proteins were removed at this step. the final step of purification involved with a size exclusion column, resulting in a purified activated renin of >98% purity, as estimated by the reducing sds-page analysis. the conversion of prorenin to renin by trypsin results in removal of  <dig> amino acids, approximately  <dig>  kda. because of heterogeneous nature of glycosylation  <cit> , prorenin and renin migrated on the sds-page gel as broad bands of around  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, respectively . the proteins were analyzed by the n-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry for further characterization of the proteolytic activation. the n-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the first residues of the mature renin were ltlgxt and verified the complete removal of the propeptide . the x represents the asparagine residue  which is a glycosylation site. mass spectrometry analysis indicated that glycosylation of renin added from  <dig> to  <dig> kda to the molecular weight, based on the calculated dna-deduced amino acid sequence. the discrepancy of molecular weights might be related to variations in growth conditions and reagents from batch to batch because of the heterogeneous nature of glycosylation . the sugar moieties were removable by endoglycosidase h treatment only in partially denatured proteins under conditions of 1% sds at 37°c overnight . in our crystallization studies and biological assays, the sugar moieties were not removed. typically, 1– <dig> mg of protein could be obtained from one batch of purification using approximately  <dig> –  <dig> ml starting conditioned medium , depending on cell well-being, growth conditions and other procedural irregularities.

the activated renin was characterized in a functional assay . the catalytic activity was measured using the commercially available substrate, dabcyl-γabu-ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu-val-ile-his-thr-edans, which is based on the angiotensinogen sequence  <cit> . velocity of reaction was initially followed by hplc and exhibited hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration consistent with michaelis-menten kinetics with an apparent km of  <dig>  μm . this value is similar to the km of  <dig>  μm reported in the literature based on the fret assay  <cit> . the catalytic efficiency of recombinant rennin was determined using the dabcyl-edans substrate. the enzyme had a second order rate constant  of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  this value is close to the published catalytic efficiency of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  <cit>  for the cleavage of angiotensinogen tetradecapeptide by purified human renin  <cit> .

enzymatic activity of the recombinant human renin was measured in a ph-rate profile. activity was measured between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  ph units . the maximum activity was observed at ph  <dig> , similar to purified human renin  <cit> . the peak and the shoulder of the ph profile were similar to those observed for purified human renin cleaving partially purified human angiotensinogen with the maxima at ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> .

several well characterized inhibitors of human renin were tested with the recombinant enzyme. these inhibitors included commercially available statines and the small molecule inhibitor aliskiren. pepstatin a  is a potent inhibitor of several aspartic proteases including cathepsin e , cathepsin d  and hiv protease . human renin is poorly inhibited by pepstatin a , while porcine renin exhibits sub-micromolar inhibition constants with this compound . the recombinant human renin was inhibited by pepstatin a with an ic <dig> of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm, similar to literature values .

sr  <dig>  is a pepstatin analog that inhibits human plasma renin activity  with the ic <dig> of  <dig> nm  <cit> . the compound is potent against purified recombinant human renin with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm 

the recombinant renin was also inhibited by aliskiren, a potent human renin inhibitor currently marketed for hypertension as tekturna  <cit> . aliskiren is selective for human renin with a reported ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm  <cit> . in our hands, ic <dig> value for recombinant human renin was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm .

the recombinant renin is indistinguishable from renin purified from human sources and stable after long term  storage at -80°c. the material is suitable for functional assays and x-ray crystallography. the material had been used to generate > <dig> renin inhibitor complexes ranging from  <dig> Å– <dig> Å resolution . a typical experiment is shown with vtp <dig> . vtp <dig> is a weak inhibitor of ic <dig>  <dig> nm. co-crystals of this compound were obtained by the hanging drop method. these crystals diffracted at  <dig> Å. this complex can be used for soaking studies with potent inhibitors, which readily displace vtp <dig> generating high quality crystals. details on the structural solutions of vtp <dig> and additional structures will be reported separately.

CONCLUSIONS
this present work describes a simple, efficient method for the production and purification of active human renin. recombinant renin can be generated in milligram quantities via a simple activation/purification sequence. biochemical properties of the recombinant human renin are indistinguishable from those reported in the literature for purified enzyme. renin inhibitors were active against the recombinant enzyme with potencies very similar to the inhibition constants measured for purified human renin. the material is highly pure and is suitable for supporting activity assays and structural biology efforts.
