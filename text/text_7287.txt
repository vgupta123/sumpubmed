BACKGROUND
since transposable elements  were first discovered in maize by mcclintock  <cit> , tes have been a hotspot subject in genetics. as the advent of genomics era, it is now known that tes constitute a significant component of eukaryotic genomes and that there are two major classes of tes  <cit> . class i elements  transpose by the mechanism of 'copy-and-paste' through a rna intermediate, while class ii elements  by the mechanism of 'cut-and-paste' through a dna intermediate.

in addition to transposition through a dna intermediate rather than a rna intermediate, dna transposable element is distinguished by terminal inverted repeats . with the action of transposase, dna transposons usually excise from one site and reinsert elsewhere in the genome. furthermore, dna transposons can be also further classified into autonomous and non-autonomous. of non-autonomous dna transposons, a group of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  first discovered in maize were found to be widespread in various higher organisms  <cit> . mites have some common characteristics: short, terminal inverted repeats , target site duplication , high at content, potential to form stable secondary structure, high number of copies in a genome  <cit> . importantly, recent genome-wide analyses revealed that mites insert preferentially into or near genes  <cit>  and that several families of mirnas in humans, arabidopsis, rice and solanaceae were derived from mites  <cit> . these results suggest that mites play important roles not only in genome evolution but also in transcriptional regulation of genes.

mites were originally discovered in plants and have two major superfamilies. they are tourist-like and stowaway-like on the basis of their similarity to two elements previously identified in maize and sorghum  <cit> . it is now clear that these two mites originated by internal deletion of the corresponding autonomous elements  <cit>  and could transpose by other autonomous dna elements  <cit> . virtually, all mites have been identified through computer-assisted database searches  <cit> . as more and more genome sequences become available, therefore, several programs have been developed for mite identification  <cit> . strikingly, a recently developed program, known as must, has been verified to be very powerful and efficient for identification of mites  <cit> . this facilitates discovery of more novel mites.

silkworm, bombyx mori, is a model insect for the order lepidoptera and has importantly economic value for silk production and bioreactor. the draft genome sequences of silkworm were released by mita et al.  <cit>  and xia et al.  <cit> , respectively. recently, a new assembly has been completed  <cit> . analyses of the silkworm genome sequence suggested that ~40% of the genome is composed of the known tes  <cit> . this number is only smaller than the te proportion  in aedes aegypti genome that has the largest proportion of tes in the insect genomes sequenced to date  <cit> . dna transposons  are only ~3% of the genome while most of the silkworm tes are retrotransposons  <cit> . although two mites, hoshidandy and organdy, were previously discovered in silkworm  <cit>  , the genome-wide information about the silkworm mites remains unclear.

in this study, we scanned the new assembly of the silkworm genome sequence to identify mites by using a recently developed program, must and a strict filtering approach  <cit> . the results indicated that the silkworm genome harbors  <dig> mite families. estimates of insertion date and diversity for each mite family showed that the silkworm mite families might have experienced burst expansions at different time points of evolution and exhibited various patterns of diversification. that mites preferentially insert into or near genes has been also confirmed in silkworm. in addition, we found evidence that a srna derived from a mite might silence its host and neighbor genes.

RESULTS
mining and characterization of mites
must  <cit> , a program designed to detect mite elements, was first used to search the silkworm genome sequence. the program identifies candidates based on common features of mites  and sequence alignment. with must, we mined  <dig> mite candidates in the silkworm genome, which were grouped into  <dig> families. then, we filtered out pseudo-mites from predicted ones by a strict approach: those containing undetermined fragments  as well as those solely composed of simple repeats and nested in repeats were considered as pseudo-mites . by this way, the number of the mite families reduced to  <dig> . these  <dig> families include  <dig> intact mites and were designated as bmmite- <dig> to bmmite- <dig>  respectively. tsd lengths of all mites range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, tir lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and full lengths of complete mites from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. three families are flanked by ta, three families flanked by twa, four families flanked by nnnnnnnn  and seven families flanked by ww, tda, att, atat, atatat, ttcattt, ttactgtat , respectively. based on the nucleotide composition of tsd,  <dig> mite families  belong to tourist-like family  <cit> ,  <dig> families  belong to stowaway-like family  <cit> ; based on the nucleotide composition of tsd and tir,  <dig> families  belong to pegasus-like family  <cit> , and the remaining  <dig> families  were novel.

 <dig> n = a/t/c/g; w = a/t; d = a/t/g.  <dig> no. fc means the number of fragmentary copies. 3no.flc indicates the number of full length copies, the number of the bracket is the ratios of full length copies in total of each mite family. 4-Δg means the average negative Δg value of each mite family. 5hoshidandy was referred to the accession no. ab <dig> in ncbi. 6organdy was first discovered in silkworm by komoto et al.  <cit> . mite families were classified based on tir, tsd and internal sequences.

three families flanked respectively by ta and by twa have no any similarities in tir and intra-sequence; they may have independent origins but may be transposed by the same transposase. four families flanked by nnnnnnnn have no any similarities in intra-sequence but have high similarities in tir regions; they may derive from a common ancestor and may be transposed by the same transposase  <cit> . seven families with different tsd, tir and intra-sequences may have different origins and may be transposed by different transposases.

next, a homology search was used to estimate number of copies for each mite family in the silkworm genome. that is, a blastn  search  <cit>  was used against the silkworm genome sequence. with this approach, we identified  <dig> mites in total, which constitute ~ <dig>  mb  of the silkworm genome. then, each mite was classified as intact  or fragmentary: individual with both complete tirs was regarded as intact and otherwise as fragmentary. as a result,  <dig> mites are intact whereas  <dig> mites are fragmentary. as mentioned above,  <dig> mites belong to  <dig> families. however, family size varies greatly among mites, which ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> . the information about insertion sites of the mites into scaffold was shown in additional file  <dig>  the largest family is bmmite- <dig> with  <dig> copies. the copies of both bmmite- <dig> and bmmite- <dig> occupy approximately 74% of all mites. the ratio of full length to all copies of each family ranges from 10% to 100%. four mite families  have the ratios less than 50% and all others more than 50%. especially, bmmitt- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  and bmmite- <dig> have 85%, 94%, 86% and 100% of high ratios, respectively, suggesting that they may be very young and active recently. it should be noted that bmmite- <dig> has the largest number  of full length mites whereas bmmite- <dig> has the largest number  of fragmentary mites among the families, suggesting that the former might experience a recent burst expansion whereas the latter might undergo an old burst expansion.

the average at content for each mite family ranges from 44% to 73%. only bmmite- <dig> has less than 50% at content and all others more than 50%, suggesting that the silkworm mites are at rich. the average at content of the silkworm genome is approximately 62%  <cit> . eight families bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig>  bmmite- <dig> and bmmite- <dig> have at content more than the average of the silkworm genome.

the secondary structure and negative Δg value of gibbs energy were predicted by unafold  <cit> . the results suggested that all the silkworm mites have the predicted secondary structures . furthermore, almost all mite families have high negative Δg values except for bmmite- <dig>  and bmmite- <dig> , indicating that most silkworm mites have potential to form stable secondary structures. these results imply that they may play important roles in transcriptional regulation of genes.

the identified silkworm mite families were annotated based on blast search. using a representative member of each mite family as query, we searched isfinder, repbase and ncbi nr databases, respectively. these three databases almost include all known mites and transposable elements. we found that bmmite- <dig> perfectly matched to one silkworm mite named hoshidandy  in ncbi nr database and bmmite- <dig> perfectly matched to organdy identified previously in silkworm  <cit>  . another  <dig> mite families have no match to any known mites or transposable elements. this suggested that the program must used in this study is feasible and efficient for identification of mites because  <dig> known families of the silkworm mites were all recovered and  <dig> novel families were discovered by must  <cit> .

verification of the predicted mites
four predicted insertion sites of bmmite- <dig> were selected for verification by pcr in  <dig> silkworm accessions representing four main geographic strains . primers were designed based on flanking regions of each insertion site . the pcr results for the four insertion sites were summarized in additional file  <dig>  furthermore, sequencing of the corresponding pcr products confirmed the presence or absence of bmmite- <dig> . the polymorphic distribution of indel for all four tested insertion sites suggested that they are not fixed residents of the silkworm genome and validated the prediction by the program must  <cit> .

estimates of insertion date and diversity
we estimated age of each full length mite by the method used for maize mite families  <cit> . briefly, we first determined divergence between each mite and the family consensus sequence, and then estimated insertion time based on the divergence. figure  <dig> showed that insertion date varies greatly among members of each family as well as among families, which ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago . strikingly, bmmite- <dig> might be dramatically expanded during a period from  <dig> mya to  <dig> mya  and accumulated up to  <dig> copies during this short period while the rest  <dig> families might experience major expansion events within  <dig> mya .

to examine intrafamily diversity pattern for each family, we performed network analyses on the basis of the alignment of full length sequences. topology of a network reflects corresponding demographic events that each mite family experienced  <cit> . for instance, a network topology showing numerous nodes distributed around its centre and separated by long branches implies that this family might experience an old population expansion. in contrast, a network topology characterized by a central node surrounded by many, almost identical, and short branches, indicates a very recent expansion from an ancestral element  <cit> .  <dig>  of  <dig> mite families presented the topologies that these mite families might experience old population expansions. the topologies of the rest  <dig> families indicated that these families might undergo recent expansions . these observations are basically consistent with the insertion time estimates.

pattern of regional variation for each family provides details of divergence between copies. we performed diversity  sliding window analysis for the alignment of full length sequence of each mite family. window size is  <dig> nucleotides and step size is  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . the regions with diversity equal or higher than average sequence diversity  +2sd was defined as variable whereas those with diversity less than average sequence diversity -2sd were considered as conserved regions . it was found that regional variation pattern varies greatly among these  <dig> silkworm mite families. almost all families have highly conserved tirs, however,  <dig> families  have only one conserved tir. because tirs must be first recognized by corresponding transposase for transposition, it is not surprising to see more conserved in tir than intra-sequence.

distributions of mites on chromosomes and estimation of mite richness in genes
we recorded information about position of each mite on a chromosome to look at distribution of mites in the genome. the results suggested that all mite families are widely distributed on all  <dig> silkworm chromosomes. then, we examined whether mites were randomly distributed among  <dig> silkworm chromosomes using χ <dig> test. the null hypothesis was rejected , suggesting that the distribution of mites is nonrandom in the silkworm genome .

next, we examined whether insertion site of each mite preferentially is in or close to genes. if a mite inserts into within the  <dig> kb flanking regions of a genes, this mite is regarded as close to a gene  <cit> . the results indicated that a larger number of mites inserted into gene regions  and flanking regions of genes.  <dig>  of the  <dig> predicted mites inserted into gene regions . of  <dig> mites inserted into gene regions,  <dig>  were located in 5` flanking regions of the closest genes,  <dig>  in exons,  <dig>  in introns and  <dig>  in 3`flanking regions of the closest genes, respectively. it appears that the silkworm mites preferentially inserted into introns and 3'-flanking regions rather than 5'-flanking regions and exons. to determine whether insertions of mites into gene regions are due to chance, we performed a computer simulation as a negative control . it was found that the silkworm mites have significantly higher insertion frequencies into gene regions than those in control , implying that the silkworm mites preferentially do insert into gene regions. when a mite insertion into within respective  <dig>  500- <dig>  and 3000- <dig> bp flanking regions of a gene was assumed to be close to a gene, the patterns of mite insertion in the genome are also similar to that a mite within  <dig> kb flanking regions of a genes .

1the distance of the insertion site from predicted gene. number in each bracket is the percentage of insertion sites. control indicates a negative experiment similar to that in  <cit> 

to investigate whether silkworm mites preferentially insert in a special gene family, we annotated all the closest genes using wego, an online gene ontology website, and compared the closest genes with all silkworm genes . the results indicated that functionalities of the closest genes were randomly selected.

a mite containing small rna and expressions of its closest genes
we scanned nr database at ncbi using a representative member of each silkworm mite family as query and found a small rna known as rna- <dig>  perfectly matched to bmmite- <dig> . this small rna is  <dig> bp long and was first discovered in silkworm ovary by kawaoka et al.  <cit> . previous studies showed that this small rna  belonged to a new class of germline-restricted small rnas  called pirnas, which is thought to defend the host genome against transposons  <cit> .

to determine whether bmmite- <dig> can regulate expressions of the closest genes through the small rna, we examined expression profiles of the closest genes using the available microarray data  <cit> . first, we found the six closest genes of bmmite-11: bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  bgibmga <dig>  and bgibmga <dig> in silkdb http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/. with information of these six genes, corresponding expression profiles were extracted from the microarray data. because bgibmga <dig> has no information in microarray data, so it was not included in the study. figure 5b showed that the five closest genes have different expression patterns. however, they have a common feature that all the five genes were not expressed in the ovary and testis. there are  <dig> active genes in the silkworm microarray data.  <dig> of  <dig> genes were expressed in ovary or testis  <cit> . thus, the probability of  <dig> random selected genes that were not expressed in ovary or testis is  <dig>   <dig> =  <dig> ). chance cannot explain the observed expression pattern. therefore, bmmite- <dig> might self-silence germline-specifically by small rna. as a result, bmmite- <dig> might silence these five closest genes in silkworm ovary through small rna pathway.

discussion
discovery and characterization of the silkworm mites
in this study, we carried out a systematic and genome-wide analysis to search for mites in silkworm using a novel computational approach, must  <cit> . first,  <dig> mites were predicted and were grouped into  <dig> families. having further examined these predicted mites, however, we found that a large number of mites were pseudo-mites. after removing pseudo-mites by a strict filtering process, we identified only  <dig> silkworm mite families. of  <dig> families, hoshidandy and organdy have been reported previously  <cit> . however,  <dig> of  <dig> families are novel according to the classification of nucleotide composition of tsd. this suggests that the procedure for mite identification used in this study is reliable.

previous studies identified various mites in other insects. for example, eight mite families were found in mosquito  <cit> . our results indicated that silkworm harbors  <dig> mite families and  <dig> of which are completely novel. furthermore, the silkworm mites show huge diversification in both tsd composition and full length sequence . however, all families have mite-specific features: high number of copies, high at content and potential to form a stable secondary structure. this also suggested validity of must in predicting the silkworm mite. in addition, the verification of predicted mites by pcr and sequencing of the pcr products showed existence of mites.

it should be pointed out that a large number of candidate mites were predicted by must at first. however, it was found that most of these candidates were false positive after filtering out by a strict process. probably, a high rate of false positive in mite identification by must is due to incompleteness of the silkworm genome sequence, that is, there are many gaps to be sequenced in the genome. again, that silkworm has a large proportion of repetitive sequences may affect correct identification of mites. in addition, a high sensitivity of must in identifying mites may be a reason. it can be known from considerations above that  <dig> mite families contained in silkworm should be a conserved number. more silkworm mites are to be identified in future.

expansion and diversity pattern
the ages of  <dig> mite families vary greatly , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mya ago. strikingly, bmmite- <dig> might be dramatically amplified during a period from  <dig> mya to  <dig> mya . a similar result has been reported that mping underwent a dramatic amplification during rice domestication  <cit> . it is interesting to determine whether silkworm mites experienced recent expansions is due to bottleneck of silkworm domestication in future.

it should also be noted that the method used to estimate time of insertion of mite copies in this study has an implicit assumption that all full sequences evolve neutrally and rate-equally  <cit> . however, this may not be true: not all sequences are under neutral evolution; there may be differential rate of substitution among nucleotides as some regions may be important for transposition and there may be different rate of change in different genomic regions. all these will affect the accuracy of estimate time of mite insertion. to solve these problems, a sophisticated estimation method needs to be established in future. nevertheless, the results of mite insertion time presented in this study should provide some useful information about the evolutionary dynamics of the silkworm mites.

our diversity analyses suggested that members of each mite family have a high level of similarity and similar sequence lengths. this shows that they can be considered as a population that experienced several successive steps of amplifications from a handful of master copies  <cit> . right after amplification, copies are almost identical but will diverge in sequence and length over time due to random mutation. therefore, a large number of identical or very similar copies within a mite family imply a recent burst. our network analyses revealed that  <dig> mite families  might experience several successive recent expansions . if these recent expansions were associated with the demographic events that silkworm experienced such as domestication bottleneck, then network topologies of above  <dig> mite families can be explained by the genome-shock theory proposed by mcclintock  <cit> . thus, it is interesting to investigate dynamics of these silkworm mite families during domestication in future.

distribution of mites in the genome and their contribution to gene regulation
our observations suggested that the silkworm mites are widely distributed in the genome. however, they are not randomly distributed on chromosomes . since the silkworm mites preferentially insert into gene regions like mites in other higher organisms, a nonrandom distribution of the silkworm mites may be due to different gene densities on chromosomes. however, we did not find the significant correlation between the densities of genes and mites among the silkworm chromosomes . thus, the causes of nonrandom distribution of the silkworm mites on chromosomes are to be explored.

we observed that the silkworm mites in introns, 3'flank and 5'flank are in total much more than in exons . it should be noted that the silkworm mites inserted into introns and 3' flanking regions significantly more than 5' flanking regions . these observations could be explained by two reasons: mite insertions in exons were rapidly purged out from a population because they are deleterious  <cit> ; because many mites have been found to contain poly  signal  <cit> , these mites are likely to be maintained in 3' flanking regions to act in regulation. since introns have been suggested to harbor regulatory elements  <cit> , much more silkworm mite insertions into introns imply that the mites may play important roles in gene expression by changing regulatory motifs. in addition, that mites preferentially insert into gene regions provides a material basis for establishment of a te-derived genetic regulatory network  <cit>  and this is also an interesting topic to be studied in future.

a recent study tried to relate mites to biogenesis of their sirnas in solanaceae  <cit> . however, evidence for functional implications of mites in gene regulation through small rna pathways is still lacking. most importantly, we found a bmmite- <dig> from which a silkworm ovarian small rna  derived . the expression data further suggested that the closest genes of bmmite- <dig> were germline-specifically silenced . because this small rna  belongs to a new class of germline-restricted small rnas  called pirnas  <cit> , our result may be the first evidence for effects of a mite on its neighbor genes in transcriptional regulation through the srna pathway. the validation of this mechanism is underway. given the high copy number of mites, many small rnas and mirnas derived from mites  <cit>  and their preferential insertion into gene regions, it will be important to systematically account for the different mechanisms of mites and their potential functional roles in transcriptional regulation of genes.

CONCLUSIONS
although mites in various higher organisms including mosquito and drosophila as well as beetle have been extensively investigated, little is known about the genome-wide information of mites in the silkworm genome. we identified the  <dig> silkworm mite families by using a recently developed algorism to scan the genome sequence. silkworm has  <dig> mite families, and furthermore,  <dig> of  <dig> families are completely novel based on the nucleotide composition of tsd. these results added new knowledge for understanding the evolution of mites. importantly, we not only corroborated the preference of mites inserted into or near genes seen in the other genomes but also found that bmmite- <dig> might silence its closest genes through srna pathway. these results emphasize the exceptional role of mites in the transcriptional regulation of genes and have general implications to understand the interaction between mites and their host genome.
