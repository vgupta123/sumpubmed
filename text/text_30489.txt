BACKGROUND
in general, inflammation plays a role in most bladder pathologies, including bladder cancer  <cit> , and represents a defensive reaction to injury caused by physical damage, chemical substances, micro-organisms, or other agents  <cit> . in particular, neurogenic bladder inflammation involves the participation of mast cells and sensory nerves. we previously presented evidence indicating a key role for mast cells and their products in bladder inflammation  <cit> . as a consequence of inflammation, products of mast cell degranulation such as tryptase can be found in the urine of both bladder cancer and cystitis patients  <cit> . in addition to tryptase, other serine proteases such as thrombin and trypsin are produced during tissue damage and make important contributions to tissue responses to injury, repair, cell survival, inflammation  <cit> , and pain  <cit> . tissue responses to these enzymes are modulated by protease-activated receptors , a unique class of g protein-coupled receptors that use a fascinating mechanism to convert an extracellular proteolytic cleavage event into a trans-membrane signal. these receptors carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by receptor cleavage .

in order to better understand the role of pars in cystitis, we used a well established mouse model  <cit>  to determine the relative effect of par-specific peptide agonists. comparison of inflammatory responses in wild type, par1- and par2-deficient mice, revealed a mandatory role of par <dig> and, to a lesser extent, par <dig> in mediating bladder responses to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli  <cit> .

four pars have been cloned to date, and all four pars are co-expressed in the mouse bladder urothelium  <cit> , with par <dig> and par <dig> being the most abundant in the bladder epithelial layer. in addition to the urothelium, par <dig> and par <dig> are also expressed in mouse detrusor muscle, and par <dig> is expressed in mouse peripheral nerves and plexus cell bodies  <cit> . similarly, in rats par <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in urothelium, detrusor muscle, and bladder nerve fibers, and bladder afferent cells in dorsal root ganglia express par <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . confocal microscopy has revealed the co-localization of par <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with protein gene products  <dig>  and vanilloid receptor  <dig>  suggesting that pars are distributed in c-fiber bladder nerves  <cit> .

in addition, pars are differentially modulated during mouse bladder inflammation. urothelial par <dig> and, to a lesser extent, par <dig> are down-regulated in acute inflammation, whereas par <dig> and par <dig> are up-regulated  <cit> . bladder fibroblasts were found to present a clear demarcation in par expression in response to acute and chronic inflammation  <cit> . additional evidence for the participation of pars in the bladder inflammatory response was the finding that known pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lps, substance p, and antigen challenge induce an increase in par <dig> rna within four hours  <cit> . upregulation of par protein levels has been shown to be part of rat bladder responses to cyclophosphamide  <cit> . since par <dig> is well represented in the urinary bladder  <cit>  and its expression is altered in bladder inflammation  <cit> , we set forth to determine the molecular pathways downstream of par <dig> activation. for this purpose, we used a combination of gene-array technology, data mining using ingenuity pathways analysis , and gene ontology  annotation.

the signal transduction pathway downstream of par activation and coupling with various g proteins is known and leads to the rapid transcription of genes involved in inflammation  <cit> . however, the exact composition of the transcriptome downstream of par activation remains to be determined. our approach revealed a cascade of par1-dependent transcripts involved in apoptosis, cell death, cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, cell motility, cell-cell interaction, gene expression, immune response, inflammation, renal and urologic development and disease, hematological disease, and cancer.

the combination of cdna arrays and in silico genomics network analysis reveals an overriding participation of par <dig> receptors in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of downstream transcripts, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding the transcriptome downstream of par <dig> activation.

RESULTS
genes downstream of par <dig> activation
seventy five genes fulfilled both the criteria of being expressed 3-fold higher after stimulation with sp or lps and of not changing expression in response to the same stimuli of par1-/- mice, and were considered to be par1-dependent . to further annotate this set of genes, we used a web-based entry tool developed by ingenuity pathways analysis   <cit> to query their knowledge database  <cit> . the resulting networks contain: a- sub-cellular layout indicating the predominant location for the expression of encoded proteins ; b-analysis of canonical pathways significantly associated with this group of genes , and c-d- biological functions across the entire dataset most significantly associated with this set of genes .

sub cellular location 
genes  were associated with function  and localized to each compartment according to ipa and gene ontology. dotted lines further group the genes by activity or function such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton re-organization and cell motility, carbohydrate metabolism, proteins and enzymes, transcription, and rna editing. of note, a particular set of genes such as dctn <dig> and arf <dig> are involved in par trafficking, and their function is associated with other par1-dependent transcripts with function in the cytoskeleton reorganization.

participation of par1-dependent genes in canonical pathways 
overall, par1-dependent transcripts belong to several canonical pathways . this type of ipa also revealed key genes that are significantly associated with more than one canonical pathway. this is the case of elk <dig>  nfkbia, hspb <dig>  dusp <dig>  and akt <dig>  in addition, this analysis indicates pathways such as vegf and integrins which share common genes, as is the case of those encoding cytoskeleton proteins actg <dig> and actb.

primary functions associated with par1-dependent genes 
figures  <dig> and  <dig> represent biological functions significantly  associated with par1-specific genes. those included: apoptosis ; cell death ; cell survival ; cancer ; cellular growth and proliferation ; cell-to-cell signaling ; hematological disease ; cellular movement ; gene expression ; immune and lymphatic system development and function ; immune response/disease ; and inflammation and inflammatory disease . this type of analysis also revealed par- <dig> dependent genes  encoding proteins associated with renal and urological diseases. figure 1d also indicates common pathways of par1-dependent transcripts shared by inflammation  and cancer  and revealed possible targets uniquely associated with some of the biological functions.

target validation by q-pcr of chromatin immunoprecipitation -based assays
of the  <dig> genes tested by q-pcr analysis of chip isolated from wild type mice challenged with control peptide, par1- and par2-ap,  <dig> genes  had their control levels  <dig>  times below background  and, therefore, their results are not being presented. results are presented in figure  <dig> as averaged transcription events detected per  <dig> cells for each gene tested and their standard deviations. with the exception of pla2g1b, these results indicate that treatment of wild type mice with par1- and par2-ap induced up-regulation of the following par1-dependent genes: actb, akt <dig>  arf <dig>  ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  dusp <dig>  fkbp1a, nfkbia, phlda <dig>  plaur, s100a <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  ube2h, and upk <dig> 

par-activation of calcium independent pla <dig> 
our cdna array results indicate that pla2g1b encoding a calcium-dependent pla <dig> was a par1-dependent transcript. however, this particular transcript was not validated by q-pcr of actively-transcribed dna . because of the prominent role of the calcium-independent phospholipase a <dig>  in mediating tryptase-activated par in bladder microvascular endothelial cells  <cit> , bladder urothelial cells  <cit> , and par2-ap in bladder contractions  <cit> , we decided to determine whether bladder instillation with par-aps also induced up-regulation of ipla <dig> in the mouse bladder mucosa. the rationale for using only the mucosa was to decrease the complexity of the bladder system, getting closer to the urothelial cell in culture used by the other authors  <cit> . for this purpose, cytoplasmic extracts from the bladder mucosa of wt mice instilled with par-aps- or control peptide- were subjected to western blot analysis to measure relative concentration of ipla <dig>  results are representative of  <dig> separate experiments . the bar graph shows the average densitometric values . when data was normalized with beta-actin used as loading control, the same relationship was observed . these data indicate that in the mouse urinary bladder, all par-aps induced up-regulation of ipla <dig> 

discussion
serine proteases that originate from the circulation , inflammatory cells , and epithelial and neuronal tissues  can specifically regulate cells by cleaving pars  <cit> . proteases cleave pars to reveal tethered ligand domains that bind to and activate the cleaved receptors. the proteases that activate pars are often generated and secreted during injury and inflammation, and pars orchestrate tissue responses to these insults, including hemostasis, inflammation, nociception, and repair mechanisms  <cit> .

the present results indicated fundamental alterations elicited by pro-inflammatory substances  in bladder gene-regulation that are mediated by activation of par <dig>  the possible mechanisms by which lps and sp induce par activation include degranulation of mast cells with a concomitant release of tryptase and plasma extravasation leading to accumulation of products of the coagulation cascade that activate pars. however, the activation of par in the physiological state is more complex. although thrombin is a recognized physiological activator of par <dig> and par <dig>  the endogenous enzymes responsible for activating par <dig> in urinary bladder are not known. recently, it was demonstrated that tissue kallikrein family of proteinases are able to regulate par signaling and may represent important endogenous regulators par <dig>  par <dig>  and par <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the kallikrein family plays a fundamental role in bladder physiology  <cit> .

transcriptional alteration downstream par activation
in terms of mechanism of action, it is well established that after stimulation, pars couple to various g proteins and activate signal transduction pathways resulting in the rapid transcription of genes that are involved in inflammation  <cit> . however, the response of the transcriptome downstream of par activation is not known. here, we used an approach involving the combination of cdna arrays, chip assay, and in silico querying of knowledge databases in order to identify functions dependent of par <dig> activation that are modified during bladder inflammation. although we clearly defined the criterion for a gene to be named par1-dependent , the expression of some/many of these genes may only be indirectly dependent on par- <dig>  due to the nature of the downstream cascades and interacting pathways.

the use of cdna arrays has contributed immensely to the understanding of inflammation, in general, and the bladder inflammatory transcriptome, in particular  <cit> . in addition, the use of curated networks such as the ingenuity pathways analysis leads to a comprehensive integration of how par1-dependent transcripts correlate with canonical pathways and known biological functions. because our results were obtained with whole bladders, it is not clear whether any single network may be operative in a particular cell type. however, this approach can potentially identify previously unrecognized connections among pathways and, therefore, suggests new hypotheses for the mechanisms of bladder inflammation. therefore, the value of our approach is to raise testable hypotheses that can be tested in isolated cells or in individual bladder layers. aberrant expression of protease-activated receptors  has been associated not only with inflammation but with increased angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis of various cancers  <cit> . therefore, our approach outlined a global visualization of par-dependent transcripts  as well as their interaction with several pathways .

our results indicated that several genes known to be part of the inflammatory response were found downstream of par <dig> activation . the present work adds to this list pro-inflammatory genes such as wnt <dig>  wisp <dig>  and dvl <dig> that belong to the wnt family known to be altered in human interstitial cystitis  <cit> . in contrast, some of the proteins encoded by par1-dependent transcripts play a role in shutting down the inflammatory cascade. this is the case with type- <dig> membrane glycoprotein encoded by cd <dig>  which delivers an inhibitory signal cancelling the inflammation-induced macrophage activation  <cit> . within this group, we also highlight nfkbia, which encodes ikappab-alpha, an inhibitor of the nf-kappab cascade  <cit> .

in addition to genes involved in inflammation, we found upregulation of members of the tetraspanin family  and upk <dig> that dimerises with the tetraspanin uroplakin 1a. cd <dig> encodes a protein localized in the membrane of mast cells  <cit> , and anti-cd <dig> antibodies inhibit mast cell adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin  <cit> . adam- <dig> may have a role in inflammation by regulating the expression of allograft inflammatory factor- <dig> and inos  <cit> . uroplakin  <dig> is a major component of the surface plaques of the urothelium  <cit> , is found exclusively in differentiated mammalian urothelium  <cit> , and is a product of terminally-differentiated apical cell layer  <cit> . in addition to differentiation, uroplakins play a fundamental role in the bladder permeability barrier  <cit> , wound healing  <cit> , bacterial adherence and infection  <cit> , and possibility bladder inflammation  <cit> . the present results are the first direct evidence indicating that inflammation per se alters the message for uroplakin  <dig> 

among the secreted enzymes regulated by par1-dependent transcripts is the calcium-dependent phospholipase a <dig>  group ib that was up-regulated by lps- and sp-induced bladder inflammation in wild type mice. our q-pcr results did not confirm an up-regulation of transcription in response to par1-ap and par2-ap. there are several explanations for this discrepancy. one possibility is that the differential expression of rna was not due to active transcription and therefore, reflects rna processing. as others have shown that the calcium independent phospholipase a <dig>  mediates bladder urothelial  <cit> , microvascular  <cit> , and smooth muscle  <cit>  responses to par activation, and has a role in promoting mmp-2-induced cell migration via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase – akt pathway  <cit> , we went further to test whether this calcium-independent pla is also up-regulated in response to par-aps. our results confirmed upregulation of ipla <dig> protein in the bladder mucosa of mice instilled with par-aps, supporting the upregulation of message levels.

another group of genes encodes proteins with roles in signal transduction pathways. those include: plaur, actr-iib, dusp <dig>  and akt <dig>  plaur encodes the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator  and promotes plasmin formation  <cit> . plaur is most closely associated with cancer invasion  <cit> . a strong correlation exists between par mediating the response of thrombin and u-par-mediated cancer cell migration/invasion  <cit> . dusp <dig> encodes a dual specificity phosphatase  <dig> or mitogen-activated protein kinase  phosphatase  <dig>  which dephosphorylates and inactivates mapks  <cit> .dusp <dig> regulates a subset of lps-induced genes  <cit>  and modulates the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone in macrophages  <cit> . akt <dig> is a putative oncogene encoding a protein belonging to a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases containing sh2-like  domains. others have shown that thrombin and par- aps induce akt <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . akt <dig> is a general protein kinase capable of phosphorylating several known proteins and, therefore, occupies a central position in several signal transduction pathways . moreover, par activation in platelets leads to akt <dig> phosphorylation by a mechanism involving either g  <cit>  or gi  <cit>  and src kinase activation  <cit> .

the process of desensitization and re-sensitization of pa receptors is being elucidated  <cit> . agonists of pars induce an irreversible activation by proteolytic cleavage of the tethered ligand peptides and rapid receptor endocytosis that are targeted to lysosomes  <cit> . interestingly, among the par1-dependent transcripts, the following encode proteins of the ubiquitin pathway: mid <dig>  ubr <dig>  pxmp <dig>  ube2h, cul <dig>  and skp1a. little is known regarding the alteration of expression of this set of genes during inflammation. however, it has been reported that tnfα stimulates ube2h expression by a mechanism involving nf-kappab  <cit> . together these results raised the intriguing hypothesis that inflammation can induce an increase in the ubiquitin pathway that also modulates the fate of pars  <cit> .

the rab family of proteins play a fundamental role in par re-sensitization  <cit> . here, we show that dcnt <dig> and arf <dig> also involved in par trafficking and are increased during inflammation. dcnt <dig> is a subunit of the dynein/dynactin complex and an effector for rab <dig>  <cit> . this protein is required for the retrograde movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules  <cit> . arf <dig> is a member of the human adp-ribosylation factor  family of proteins belonging to the ras superfamily of small gtpase implicated in vesicle trafficking  <cit> . arf <dig> participates in the endosomal pathway that regulates endocytosis of several receptors  <cit> . post-internalization, arf <dig> and other membrane components are recycled back to the cell surface  <cit> . in addition to membrane trafficking, arf <dig> cellular functions include: actin remodeling, cell adhesion, redistribution of β <dig> integrins, phagocytosis, cell division, and tumor-cell invasion .

as alterations in par density itself  <cit>  or in the mechanisms involved in re-sensitization of these receptors can have strong consequences in the shift between homeostasis and inflammation, our results raise the intriguing hypothesis that, in contrast to par endocytosis and cessation of the stimulus that occurs during normal physiological responses, inflammation may lead to increased re-cycling of pars back to the plasma membrane and, therefore, perpetuation of the signal transduction downstream of par activation.

although the classification by biological function permits a visual association of genes and cellular processes , it has the disadvantage of over simplification because several genes may belong to more than one group. this is the case of mmp <dig>  that is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes such as inflammation and cancer. therefore, we constructed figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in order to illustrate common pathways involving par1-dependent transcripts. this type of association analyses permits the identification of new pathways such as the interaction of par1-dependent transcripts with the vegf-family of growth factors, and suggests explanations of an active role of par in angiogenesis  <cit> . together, the pathway analysis revealed relevant target for therapeutic interventions to control or to prevent disease progression and bladder inflammation.

other cdna array analysis
we are aware of a single publication investigating genes downstream of par <dig> activation. this work was performed in a human endothelial cell line challenged with thrombin with the aim of identifying early genes and comparing to those up-regulated in response to leukotriene d <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, the referred work did not provide genbank accession numbers for the par <dig> activated transcripts, which makes comparisons of the results to the current study difficult. nevertheless, some similarities could be found between their work and the present one. this is the case of dusp <dig> that was found upregulated in both manuscripts. in addition we found adam <dig>  whereas uzonyi, et al. found another disintegrin-like metalloprotease   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work indicates an overriding participation of par <dig> receptors in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of a network of transcripts downstream of par <dig> activation, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding the regulation of par. in this context, the activation of genes such as dusp <dig> and nfkbia seems to counter balance the inflammatory response to par activation by avoiding prolonged activation of p <dig> mapk and increased cytokine production  <cit> . in contrast, transcripts such as arf <dig> and dcnt <dig> that are involved in the mechanism of receptor re-sensitization would tend to perpetuate the inflammatory reaction. it remains to be determined whether par <dig> receptor blockade or selective gene silencing transcripts downstream of par activation will ameliorate the clinical manifestation of cystitis. inhibiting of par up-regulation using small interfering rna technology, as confirmed by immunoblotting, should substantially reduced bladder inflammatory response as it has been shown in other systems  <cit> .
