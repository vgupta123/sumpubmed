BACKGROUND
several factors have been proposed to act on the pathogenesis of eating disorders  <cit> , as individual vulnerability, stress exposure and caloric restriction  <cit> . thus, animal studies have shown that chronic stress increases the consumption of "comfortable food", that is, palatable food  <cit> , and precipitates binge eating  <cit> ; similarly, human studies indicate that most individuals increase food intake during stress and that eating disorders usually emerge after a period of caloric restriction  <cit> .

compulsive food seeking characterizes some pathological overeating, as compulsive drug seeking characterizes drug-addiction  <cit> . note that drugs of abuse and pathological food intake show behavioral similarities, and several brain areas, as well as neurotransmitters systems, have been involved in the reinforcement of both food and drugs, thus suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate some common neural systems  <cit> . moreover, acute or chronic stress influences both food intake and the propensity to take drugs  <cit> .

recent evidence suggests the possibility of producing animal models of eating disorders  <cit> . to our knowledge, however, no evidence has been reported of continued food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences, an index of compulsive behavior  <cit> .

in this study we assessed if chronic stress is able to render palatable food seeking impervious to signals of punishment, leading to food compulsion in sated mice. appetitive behavior for natural and drug rewards is normally suppressed by aversive stimuli or outcomes, a phenomenon called conditioned suppression  <cit> . using a new conditioned suppression paradigm, we investigated whether the ability of a foot-shock-paired conditioned stimulus  to suppress chocolate-seeking behavior was reversed by exposure to chronic stress, thus modeling food seeking in spite of harmful consequences in mice. milk chocolate was chosen based on previous studies showing its rewarding properties in animals  <cit> . in addition, chocolate is the most commonly craved food and chocolate craving and addiction have been proposed in humans  <cit> .

recent evidence points to a critical role of prefrontal cortex in motivated behavior related to food or drugs, in both animals and humans  <cit> . norepinephrine  transmission in medial prefrontal cortex  has been shown to be involved in the behavioral and central effects of drugs of abuse  <cit> , and to be critical for food-related motivated behavior  <cit> .

based on these evidences, we hypothesize that norepinephrine in the mpfc has a major role also in maladaptive seeking/intake for palatable foods. thus, we assessed if selective prefrontal ne depletion eliminates food seeking in spite of harmful consequences shown by sated mice exposed to chronic stress.

here using a new conditioned suppression paradigm, we investigated whether the ability of a foot-shock-paired conditioned stimulus to suppress chocolate-seeking behavior was antagonized by previous exposure to a chronic stressful experience, thus modeling aberrant chocolate seeking in sated mice. our findings demonstrate that while control  animals showed a profound conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking during presentation of conditioned stimulus, previously food deprived  animals revealed a clear-cut preference for the chamber containing chocolate, thus indicating that previous exposure to a food restriction experience induces food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences, which is an index of compulsive behavior. moreover, we found that maladaptive chocolate seeking is prevented by selective norepinephrine inactivation, thus showing that prefrontal cortical norepinephrine is critical also for aberrant food-related behavior.

RESULTS
experiment 1: conditioned suppression test in control and food deprived groups
control  and food deprived mice showed no significant difference in total time spent in chocolate-chamber  in comparison with empty-safe chamber  during the training phase and on the choice check test day. comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups indicated that both groups showed a significant preference for the chocolate-chamber in comparison with empty-safe chamber during the training phase   =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), and on the choice check test day   =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) aimed at assessing whether the preference for chocolate was still present the day after the conditioned stimulus -shock pairing session and before the testing session.

* p <  <dig>  in comparison with empty-safe chamber ; & p <  <dig>   <dig> in comparison with empty-safe chamber.

for the conditioned suppression test, statistical analysis performed on total time, revealed significant chamber × pretreatment interaction  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups showed a different behavioral pattern in the two groups. control animalsrevealed a significant aversion for the chamber containing chocolate, in which cs was present , as shown by the time spent  in this chamber in comparison with the empty but "safe" chamber   =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). thus, control animals showed a profound conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking during presentation of cs, indicating that chocolate seeking was sensitive to an adverse stimulus . by contrast, food deprived animals revealed a clear-cut preference for the chamber containing chocolate, as shown by the time they spent in the chamber containing chocolate compared with that in the empty but "safe" chamber  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) . this conclusion was confirmed by statistical analysis carried out on time spent in chocolate-chamber in comparison with empty-safe chamber during presentation of the cs only  in the conditioned suppression test  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). while control animals revealed a significant aversion to the chamber containing chocolate, in which cs was present  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), food deprived animals revealed a clear-cut preference for the chamber containing chocolate  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) during presentation of the cs only.

moreover it's worth noting that, as expected from studies with inbred mice, the individual scores of food deprived animals were, for all individuals, higher than those of each mice included in control group  =  <dig> ); p <  <dig> . control =  <dig> ± 50; food deprived =  <dig> ±  <dig>  empty-safe chamber  =  <dig> ) p <  <dig> . control =  <dig> ± 75; food deprived =  <dig> ± 22).

experiment 2: effects of selective prefrontal ne depletion on conditioned suppression test
sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice showed no significant difference in total time spent in chocolate-chamber in comparison to empty-safe chamber during the training phase and on the choice check test day. comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups indicated that both groups showed a significant preference for the chocolate-chamber in comparison with the empty-safe chamber during the training phase  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> )), and on the choice check test day  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ).

for the conditioned suppression test, statistical analysis performed on total time, revealed significant chamber × pretreatment interaction  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups showed a different behavioral pattern in two groups.

sham food deprived animals showed no conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking; in fact, they dramatically preferred the chamber containing food even though there was a signaled  incoming aversive event  ; thus, they paralleled naïve animals  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). on the contrary, ne depleted food deprived animals showed no significant preference for the chamber containing chocolate ,  =  <dig> ; n.s.), thus strongly indicating that prefrontal ne depletion was responsible for maladaptive eating behavior observed in sham food deprived animals.

this conclusion was confirmed by results from statistic carried out on time spent in chocolate-chamber in comparison with empty-safe chamber during presentation of the cs only  in the conditioned suppression test  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). while sham food deprived animalsrevealed a significant preference for the chamber containing chocolate, in which cs was present  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), ne depleted food deprived animals revealed no significant preference for the chamber containing chocolate  =  <dig> ; n.s.) during presentation of the cs only.

sham and ne depleted control mice showed no significant difference in total time spent in chocolate-chamber in comparison with empty-safe chamber during the training phase and on the choice check test day. comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups showed in both groups a significant preference for the chocolate-chamber in comparison with the empty-safe chamber during the training phase  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted control:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> )), and on the choice check test day  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted control:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ).

for the conditioned suppression test, statistical analysis performed on total time, revealed significant chamber × pretreatment interaction  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). comparison of time spent in chocolate-chamber and empty-safe chamber within each groups showed in both groups a significant aversion for the chamber containing chocolate  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted control:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). , thus indicating that prefrontal ne depletion had no effect in control, non-food deprived, animals.

chocolate intake and body weight
regarding experiment  <dig>  statistical analysis carried out on chocolate intake data during the training phase of the conditioned suppression test in control and food deprived animals revealed a significant pretreatment  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) and day effect  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) effect. simple effect analyses revealed a significant effect of day for both groups  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; food deprived: f  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) and a significant difference between control and food deprived at all time points, thus indicating that both groups showed a daily increase of chocolate intake through the training phase and that food deprived animals ate more chocolate than control animals.

regarding chocolate intake on the choice check and conditioned suppression test days, statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in chocolate consumption between control and food deprived animals  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; suppression test day:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), indicating a compulsive chocolate intake in food deprived animals.

results from chocolate intake during conditioned suppression test day show thatprevious exposure to a stressful food restriction experience induces food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences , which is an index of compulsive behavior.

moreover, it should be noted that the behavior shown by the food deprived mice cannot be ascribed to a homeostatic response to dietary deficiencies because they returned to ad libitum feeding and to initial body weight  =  <dig> ; n.s.) before conditioned suppression test day and no significant difference in body weight  =  <dig> ; n.s.)  was evident between control and food deprived groups on the conditioned suppression test day. thus, these data indicate that food seeking in spite of harmful consequences observed in food deprived mice was not determined by general motivation to eat, akin to hunger, but rather by a more specific motivational state, akin to craving.

regarding experiment  <dig>  statistical analysis carried out on chocolate intake data in both sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived animals during the training phase of the conditioned suppression test revealed a significant day effect only  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). simple effect analyses revealed a significant effect of day for both groups  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), thus indicating that all groups showed daily increased chocolate intake through the training phase.

concerning chocolate intake on the choice check and conditioned suppression test days in food deprived animals, statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in chocolate consumption between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups  =  <dig>  n.s.; suppression test: f  =  <dig> ; n.s.) , thus ruling out that the effects of prefrontal ne depletion on the conditioned suppression test can be ascribed to the different consumption pattern shown by ne depleted food deprived and sham food deprived animals. finally, statistical analysis for chocolate intake on the choice check and conditioned suppression test days in control, non-food deprived animals revealed no significant differences in chocolate consumption between sham control and ne depleted control groups  =  <dig>  n.s.; suppression test: f  =  <dig> ; n.s.) .

regarding weight results from conditioned suppression experiments, a statistical analysis revealed no significant difference on the day the experiment started  between control and food deprived animals  =  <dig> ; n.s.) or between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice  =  <dig> ; n.s.) and no significant difference on the conditioned suppression test day between control and food deprived animals  =  <dig> ); n.s.) or between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice  =  <dig> ; n.s.) . finally, although a significant difference was observed between control and food deprived groups  =  <dig> ): p <  <dig> ), there was no significant difference between sham food deprived and ne depleted mice food deprived  =  <dig> ; n.s.) on the choice check test day. a comparison between initial weight and weight on the conditioned suppression test day, carried out for food restricted groups , revealed no significant effect for food deprived  =  <dig> ; n.s.), sham food deprived  =  <dig> ; n.s.) or ne depleted food deprived  =  <dig> ; n.s.) groups.

thus, the different behavioral outcomes observed in sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups cannot be ascribed to a difference in consumption patterns during the training phase of the conditioned suppression test or to unspecific effects of prefrontal ne depletion on recovery of body weight when animals returned to ad libitum feeding. in fact, no significant difference in chocolate consumption was found between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups on the training days  =  <dig> ; n.s.), the choice check  =  <dig> ; n.s.) or the test  =  <dig> ; n.s.)  days, and no significant difference in body weight was observed between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups on the choice check  =  <dig> ; n.s.) or the conditioned suppression test  =  <dig> ; n.s.) days .

conditioned aversion test
data from the conditioned aversion test in food deprived animals  revealed a significant chamber effect  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). food deprived animals showed a significant aversion for the conditioned stimulus-paired chamber  in comparison with the empty-safe chamber   =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) . thus, the effects shown by food deprived mice in the conditioned suppression test cannot be ascribed to unspecific impairment of the foot-shock-cs association induced by food restriction, because food deprived animals was able to associate the shock with the light.

data from the conditioned aversion test in sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups revealed a significant chamber effect  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) and no significant difference between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups. sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups showed a clear aversion to the conditioned stimulus-paired chamber in comparison with empty-safe chamber  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; ne depleted fd:  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) . thus, the effects of prefrontal ne depletion in the conditioned suppression test cannot be ascribed to unspecific impairment of the foot-shock-cs association because there were no significant differences between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice in the conditioned avoidance test, in agreement with previous results showing that prefrontal ne depletion did not interfere with either associative or mnemonic processes.

shock sensitivity
statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups . performances of the two groups cannot be ascribed to differences in shock sensitivity, because similar mean shock thresholds  were observed in sham fd and ne depleted fd mice  .

selective ne depletion in medial prefrontal cortex
statistical analysis for the effects of prefrontal ne depletion on dopamine and ne tissue levels in the mpfc showed a significant effect only for ne  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ). selective depletion of ne prefrontal cortical afferents produced an approximately 90% decrease in ne tissue levels , whereas it spared da tissue levels . no significant effect was evident for either ne or dopamine in the nucleus accumbens .

note that ne depletion method used here does not affect either other brain areas such as cingulated cortex as previously reported  <cit> .

discussion
here, using a new conditioned suppression paradigm, we report evidence of food seeking/intake in the face of adverse consequences. we modeled this maladaptive eating behavior in sated micepreviously exposed to a food restriction experience.

in fact, in the conditioned suppression test control  animals revealed a significant aversion for the chamber containing chocolate, in which cs was present , as shown by the time spent) in this chamber in comparison with the empty but "safe" chamber , thus, indicating that chocolate seeking was sensitive to an adverse stimulus. by contrast, food deprived animals revealed a clear-cut preference for the chamber containing chocolate, thus indicating that previous exposure to a food restriction experience induces food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences, which is an index of compulsive behavior  <cit> .

moreover food deprived animals, although sated, ate more chocolate than control animals on the conditioned suppression test day thus indicating an excessive chocolate intake. note that the behavior shown by the food deprived mice cannot be ascribed to a homeostatic response to dietary deficiencies because they returned to ad libitum feeding and to initial body weight before the conditioned suppression test day and no significant difference in body weight was evident between control and food deprived groups on the conditioned suppression test day. thus, these data indicate that excessive chocolate seeking observed in food deprived mice was not determined by general motivation to eat, akin to hunger, but rather by a more specific motivational state, akin to craving.

however, since food deprived mice were exposed to chocolate in the test apparatus while being food deprived , chocolate might be more rewarding in the food deprived than in the control mice, thus making the food deprived mice more motivated to consume chocolate during the final test. further experiments will be carried out in order to assess this point.

moreover, conditioned suppression in previously food-restricted animals may involve an incentive learning process  <cit>  that allows the animals to assign an appropriate value to a reward that is modulated by its motivational states. this learning process is engaged when animals contact and experience the reward in the relevant state. thus, exposure to chocolate during training, that is when animals are still in food-restriction, may have increased the perceived salience of chocolate due to the motivational state induced by feeding regimen that would lead to an increased value of the reinforce at the moment of test, that is when animals are yet in free-feeding for two days. this is consistent with results of balleine and dickinson   <cit>  showing that the deprived state able to increase incentive value is critical if animals are exposed far from testing but not at the test.

note that we aimed at increasing the salience and the motivational value of chocolate before testing, by modulating the motivational state by food-restriction, an experience that makes animals deprived and that is, at the same time, able to sensitize the brain reward system  <cit> .

the effects shown by food deprived mice in the conditioned suppression test cannot be ascribed to unspecific impairment of the foot-shock-cs association induced by food restriction, because food deprived animals were able to associate the shock with the light , as shown by an additional conditioned avoidance experiment.

food restriction in rodents is commonly considered a stressful conditions leading to, among other effects, altered sensitization of brain reward systems  <cit> . accordingly, a number of reports in the last two decades have shown that stress hormones as glucocorticoids, acth or crf are affected by food restriction also depending on the circadian rhythm  <cit> . although we have not assessed hormones in our experimental groups, it is very likely that the food-restriction paradigm we used affects hormones consistently with what observed in the literature.

because the behavioral outcome shown in conditioned suppression test is reminiscent of aberrant eating behaviors observed in humans, the animal model proposed here could be a good tool for understanding how maladaptive environmental influences, such as exposure to chronic stress, previous caloric restriction and access to highly palatable food, contribute to aberrant eating behaviors, as obesity. obesity is a multifactorial disease caused by environmental and genetic factors and by the complex interactions among them  <cit> . of the environmental factors that influence obesity, the availability of seductive foods is the most obvious. moreover, stress has a potential role in obesity  <cit> . as previously underlined, food restriction in rodents is commonly considered a stressful condition leading to altered sensitization of brain reward systems  <cit>  and greater sensitization of the reward system can lead to excessive intake of highly palatable food  <cit> . in fact, repeated stimulation of reward pathways through highly palatable food may lead to neurobiological adaptations that make the ingestive behavior more compulsive  <cit> .

besides environmental also genetic factors play a large role in obesity  <cit> . genetic studies have revealed point mutations that are of importance for obesity and genetic predisposition can be important in determining the degree of obesity in response to high-fat diet  <cit> . finally, studies in mice show that certain strains of mice, as c57bl/ <dig>  have increased susceptibility to weight gain on a high-fat diet, showing genetic predisposition to obesity  <cit> .

based on evidence pointing to the involvement of prefrontal cortical ne transmission in the behavioral and central effects of drugs of abuse  <cit> , and in food-related motivated behavior , we tested the hypothesis that ne in mpfc has a major role also in aberrant motivation related to seeking of palatable foods, assessing the effects of selective prefrontal ne depletion on conditioned suppression test.

while sham food deprived animals showed no conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking thus paralleling naïve animals, ne depleted food deprived animals showed no significant preference for the chamber containing chocolate, thus strongly indicating that prefrontal ne transmission was responsible for maladaptive eating behavior observed in sham food deprived animals.

these results extend previous findings on the role of prefrontal ne transmission in food-related motivated behavior  <cit>  and show for the first time that prefrontal cortical ne has a major role also in aberrant behaviors related to seeking/intake of palatable foods. moreover, they are consistent with a critical role of prefrontal cortical ne in the attribution of motivational salience  <cit>  and suggest strongly that food seeking in spite of harmful consequences is the expression of aberrant motivation controlled by noradrenergic transmission in the mpfc.

it must be taken into account, however, that prefrontal ne depletion did not reinstate conditioned avoidance in food deprived mice, since depleted mice showed neither preference nor aversion of the chocolate-chamber. therefore, although prefrontal ne plays an important role in the insensitivity to presentation of an aversive cs in food-deprived animals, it is unlikely the sole responsible mediator of this effect.

recent evidence points to a critical role of prefrontal ne transmission in food-related motivated behavior through modulation of dopamine in nucleus accumbens  <cit> . as dopaminergic transmission in nucleus accumbens is the most clearly established mechanism reinforcing the effects of rewarding food  <cit> , the influence of prefrontal ne depletion in conditioned suppression test, observed in the present experiments, could depend on the impaired response of prefrontal-accumbal catecholamine system  <cit>  to highly motivating stimuli  <cit> .

in fact, ne transmission is necessary for motivational salience attribution to reward related stimuli through dopaminergic transmission within nucleus accumbens that is considered to mediate the hedonic impact of reward or some aspects of reward learning  <cit> . moreover, prefrontal ne is crucial for motivational salience related to stimuli perceived as provided of intense salience by the individual organism depending on either their intrinsic properties  or the motivational state of the organism, in the latter case affecting "perceived" salience. food deprived mice are likely to be characterized by sensitized reward system that leads to perceive palatable food as highly salient due not only to its intrinsic properties but also to the motivational state of the organism. this makes chocolate being provided of intense motivational salience that produces disruption of conditioned suppression observed in our experiments. noradrenergic prefrontal transmission, probably through modulation of dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens, is a necessary condition for motivational processing of reward related stimuli. this is the starting point to possible feeding behavior driven by aberrant motivation and leading to excessive palatable food intake.

further experiments will be carried out in order to assess this point.

finally, a role of corticotropin releasing factor  may be also envisaged due to its role in the possible stressful effects of food-restriction on nucleus accumbens either, directly or through prefrontal cortical ne. crf has been shown to amplify positive motivation to rewards due to its action in nucleus accumbens shell  <cit> . moreover, crf is known to control locus coeruleus mediated activation of ne in the prefrontal cortex  <cit>  that, as we have shown, controls accumbal dopamine response to natural  or pharmacological rewards  <cit> . such an action of prefrontal cortical ne on dopamine transmission in the accumbens is likely to involve alpha- <dig> receptors as a pioneering study on prefrontal ne regulation of the accumbal dopamine response to amphetamine has shown  <cit> .

note that the effects of prefrontal ne depletion in the conditioned suppression test cannot be ascribed to unspecific impairment of the foot-shock-cs association because there were no significant differences between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice in the conditioned avoidance test, in agreement with previous results showing that prefrontal ne depletion did not interfere with either associative or mnemonic processes  <cit> . moreover, the shock sensitivity of sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived mice was not significantly different. in addition, data from sham control and ne depleted control groups clearly indicate that prefrontal ne depletion has no significant effect in non-food restricted animals. in fact, prefrontal ne depletion did not abolish the aversion for the chocolate-chamber showed by sham control animals.

finally, the different behavioral outcomes observed in sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups cannot be ascribed to a difference in consumption patterns during the training phase of the conditioned suppression test or to unspecific effects of prefrontal ne depletion on recovery of body weight when animals returned to ad libitum feeding. in fact, no significant difference in chocolate consumption was found between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups on the training days, the choice check or the test days, and no significant difference in body weight was observed between sham food deprived and ne depleted food deprived groups on the choice check or the conditioned suppression test.

drug abuse and palatable food intake show behavioral similarities, and several brain areas, as well as neurotransmitter systems, have been involved in the reinforcement of both food and drugs, thus suggesting that natural and pharmacological stimuli activate some common neural systems  <cit> . because a hallmark feature of addiction is compulsive drug use in the face of adverse consequences  <cit> , our results might not only be helpful in the search for neurobiological substrates of aberrant eating behaviors, but might also provide insight into the neural mechanisms of drug addiction. finally, the model proposed can be helpful to envisage new therapeutic targets and develop suitable strategies for aberrant eating behaviors.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report evidence of palatable food seeking/intake in the face of adverse consequences. we modeled this behavior in sated mice exposed to a food restriction experience and demonstrate that food seeking in spite of harmful consequences is prevented by selective ne inactivation in medial prefrontal cortex.

using a conditioned suppression paradigm, we investigated whether the ability of a foot-shock-paired conditioned stimulus to suppress chocolate-seeking behavior was antagonized by previous exposure to a food restriction experience, thus modeling aberrant chocolate seeking in mice. control animals showed a profound conditioned suppression of chocolate seeking during presentation of conditioned stimulus, indicating that chocolate seeking was sensitive to an adverse stimulus. by contrast, food deprived animals showed a maladaptive chocolate seeking/intake, thus indicating that previous exposure to a food restriction experience induces food seeking/intake despite its possible harmful consequences, which is an index of compulsive behavior.

the behavioral outcome shown in conditioned suppression test is reminiscent of aberrant eating behaviors in humans, such as obesity and binge-eating, that can be driven by environmental factors apart from metabolic control. our results show, for the first time, the possibility of modeling in sated mice aberrant palatable food seeking/intake in the face of adverse consequences, a major characteristic of addiction.

the animal model proposed here could be a good tool for understanding how maladaptive environmental influences, such as exposure to chronic stress and access to highly palatable food, contribute to aberrant eating behaviors.

moreover, we found that food seeking in spite of harmful consequences is prevented by selective ne inactivation in mpfc, thus demonstrating that ne transmission in mpfc is critical for food-related motivated behavior. these results also extend previous findings on the role of prefrontal ne transmission in food-related motivated behavior by showing that prefrontal cortical ne has a major role also in maladaptive eating behaviors related to seeking/intake of palatable foods, thus pointing to "top-down" influence on eating disturbances and to new targets for therapy of aberrant eating behaviors.
