BACKGROUND
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  has been isolated from a variety of samples and cells from healthy cattle and from cattle that have experienced abortion or affected by metritis, pneumonia, diarrhoea, respiratory infection, and mammary pustular dermatitis  <cit> . the virus was first isolated in europe from cattle with respiratory and ocular diseases by bartha et al.  <cit>  and later in the united states by mohanty et al.  <cit> . subsequently, distinct bohv- <dig> isolates were obtained both in europe and in the united states  <cit> . however, the pathogenic role of bohv- <dig> remains unclear and despite its tropism for bovine endometrial cells  <cit> , experimental disease has been reproduced by only a limited number of investigators  <cit> . bohv- <dig> is classified as a gammaherpesvirus based on genome sequence and differs from other gammaherpesviridae members in important biological properties  <cit> . unlike most other gammaherpesviruses, bohv- <dig> causes a cytopathiceffect  and replicates in a variety of primary cultures and cell lines of bovine and various other animal species  <cit> . in addition, there is no evidence for oncogenicity or growthtransformation by bohv- <dig> 

in contrast to bohv- <dig>  bovine viral diarrhoea virus  is a pestivirus considered to be one of the major viral pathogens of cattle and causes significant economic losses worldwide  <cit> . pestiviruses are classified as a separate genus within the family flaviviridae, which also includes flaviviruses and the hepatitis c virus group  <cit> . currently three pestivirus species are recognized, namely, bvdv, classical swine fever virus, and border disease virus of sheep. the pestivirus genomes are positive-stranded rnas, usually of approximately  <dig>  nucleotides, which encode polyproteins of around  <dig>  amino acids  <cit> . entire or partial genomic sequences of numerous bvdv, classical swine fever virus, and border disease virus isolates have been determined  <cit> , and their comparison has demonstrated a high degree of sequence conservation among pestiviruses. the virions of pestiviruses consist, together with the rna, of four structural proteins, the nucleocapsid c protein and the envelope glycoproteins erns, e <dig>  and e <dig>  <cit> . currently,  <dig> pestiviral proteins have been identified as products of polyprotein processing, which occurs co- and post-translationally, due to the activity of viral and host cell proteases. in the hypothetical polyprotein, the proteins are arranged in the order npro/c/erns/e1/e2/ns2/ns3/ns4a/ns4b/ns5a/ns5b  <cit> . the ge <dig> protein of the bvdv nadl strain consists of about  <dig> amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the n terminus of bvdv ge <dig> is formed by arg- <dig>  and the c terminusis located around amino acid  <dig>  the c terminus of ge <dig> includesapproximately  <dig> amino acids, which could function as a transmembraneanchor for ge <dig>  and has a translocation signal for the downstreamprotein. full-length ge <dig> remains cell associated in virus-infectedcells  <cit> . due to the immunodominant characteristics of bvdv e <dig> glycoprotein  <cit> , in the present work we explored the feasibility of employing a bohv- <dig> – based vector to deliver the bvdv glycoprotein e <dig> as a secreted form and generated a model for bvdv and other pestiviruses vaccination by bohv- <dig> expressing bvdv ge <dig> 

RESULTS
rational design and construction of a plasmid vector expressing bvdv ge2
we first optimized a suitable expression cassette to achieve a robust expression of ge <dig> by eukaryotic cells before attempting to express bvdv ge <dig> in a bohv- <dig> based vector. it has been reported that mice and cattle immunized with plasmid encoding a secreted form of ge <dig> developed significantly higher igg and virus neutralizing antibody titres compared to animals vaccinated with plasmid encoding a membrane linked ge <dig>  <cit> . two expression cassettes were therefore constructed, pcmv-igke2- <dig> and pcmv-igke2- <dig>  expressing the secreted form of ge <dig>  pcmv-igke2- <dig> , contained the cytomegalovirus  promoter, an immunoglobulin k light chain  leader sequence specifying secretion of heterologous proteins, the ge <dig> orf lacking the putative transmembrane domain and a polar hydrophilic ) non structured 14-amino-acid peptide , that we hypothesized would increase the secretion of the protein. to test this hypothesis, a second expression cassette, pcmv-igke2- <dig>  was constructed as a control. the polar hydrophilic 14-amino-acid peptide of pcmv-igke2- <dig> was substituted with a less hydrophilic 23-amino-acid peptide . next, the translation and secretion of e <dig> in the culture medium, compared with the fraction retained in the cells, was assessed in transiently transfected hek 293t cells, by western blotting. as shown in fig. 1e, ge2- <dig> was better secreted into the culture supernatant, compared to ge2- <dig> that was abundantly retained in the cell fraction. the densitometric quantification of the bands revealed ~ <dig> fold better secretion of e2- <dig> compared to e2- <dig>  cmv-igke2- <dig> was then employed to generate a recombinant bohv- <dig> 

site specific targeted integration of igke2- <dig> expression cassette into the bohv- <dig> based vector genome by galk system
the thymidine kinase  gene has been disrupted in several herpesviruses, including bohv- <dig>  by the insertion of foreign sequences without interfering with viral replication in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, this genomic region is highly conserved among bohv- <dig> isolates  <cit> , ensuring the stability of the genomic locus for the insertion of foreign expression cassettes. therefore, the bohv- <dig> tk gene was chosen as a target site for the insertion of cmv-igke2- <dig> expression cassette to integrate the igke2- <dig> expression cassette into the bohv- <dig> genome, cloned as bac  <cit> . the bacrecombineering system approach  <cit> , modified by the introduction of a kanamycin selection step, was used for this purpose. accordingly, the galactokinase cassette  along with a kanamycin resistance cassette, both under the control of constitutively active prokaryotic promoters, were subcloned in pint <dig>  <cit>  to be flanked by the bohv- <dig> tk gene and adjacent sequences. the generated targeting vector   was excised out from the plasmid backbone and used for heat-inducible homologous recombination in sw <dig> e. coli containing the bac bohv- <dig> genome. following a positive selection in minimal medium containing galactose  and a second positive selection with medium containing kanamycin , all the clones analyzed displayed the correct targeting . thus, the second selection with kanamycin reduced the background to zero. a second targeting vector was generated sub-cloning in pint <dig> the cmv-igke2- <dig>  and re-targeting was performed to replace the kanagalk cassette with the cmv-igke2- <dig> cassette . negative selection on dog minimal plates, following a negative selection with medium containing kanamycin and keeping clones surviving in medium containing chloramphenicol but dieing in medium containing kanamycin, allowed the isolation of clones all positive for the right targeting, without background . next, the bac bohv- <dig> genome transporting the cmv-igke2- <dig> cassette into the tk locus was transfected in bek cells expressing the cre recombinase to remove the bac cassette flanked by the lox sequences and to reconstitute the infectious virus .

bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk allows robust expression and secretion of ge2- <dig> in the supernatant of infected cells
to evaluate ge2- <dig> expression by the bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk infection, several bovine cell lines, including bek, stromal, bend, peb, mdbk and bomac cells were acutely infected with  <dig> m.o.i. of bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk; at  <dig> h post-infection, the medium was removed, cells were gently washed with serum-free medium to eliminate any trace of serum protein and incubatedfor  <dig> h with new serum-free medium. thus, the only proteins present in the medium were cell-secreted proteins. the medium was analyzed by western immunoblotting. as shown in fig. 3a, of ge2- <dig> expression well detected for all cell lines tested, although high variability was observed among the lines. the highest expression was observed for the stromal cell line, while the mdbk cell line gave the lowest.

the outcome of bohv- <dig> infection depended on the cell type: ì) persistent infection, as is the case for bomac cells where, following permissive infection with an extensive cpe, surviving and replicating cells were found to be persistently infected, maintaining the viral genome over many passages and producing low levels of infectious virus. ìì) permissive infection, characterized by strong cpe and an abundant viral replication and high level of infectious virus production, as observed in bek cells. ììì) un-permissive infection, observed in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line , where bohv- <dig> infected cells produced low levels of early and late viral rnas, but caused no cytopathic effect.

ge2- <dig> expression and secretion was assessed for these three types of infection and a time course was performed, sampling the medium at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection. the best expression was observed for persistently infected bomac cells .

ge2- <dig> retains native antigenic properties
the e <dig> protein plays a major role in virus attachment and entry of bvdv  <cit> . furthermore, bvdv e <dig> is important for the inductionof neutralizing antibodies  <cit>  and protection against bvdv challenge in cattle  <cit> . therefore, we explored the antigenic properties of ge2- <dig> expressed and secreted by bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk infected cells, by performing a serum neutralization inhibition test, based on the capability of ge2- <dig> to reduce or block the activity of neutralizing antibodies against bvdv . four heat-inactivated bovine sera that were positive for virus-neutralizingantibodies against bvdv were selected and incubated with conditioned medium containing ge2- <dig>  positive and negative controls, as well as virus controls, were included . virus suspension containing bvdv nadl was added to each well. after incubation, mdbk cell suspension was added. viral infectivity and serum-neutralizing activitythrough the cytopathic effect were detected by microscopy and/or crystal violet staining of the cell monolayer. the neutralization antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the final dilution of serum that completely inhibited viral infectivity. a strong reduction of the neutralizing activity of the sera was obtained by the conditioned medium containing ge2- <dig> . no neutralizing inhibition was observed in the control assay performed with conditioned medium in the absence of ge2- <dig>  these findings allowed us to show that ge2- <dig> maintains the native antigenic properties of bvdv e <dig> 

bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk expressing ge2- <dig> is immunogenic and elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies against bvdv
after collection of preimmune serum, a group of  <dig> bvdv serum negative rabbits and a group of  <dig> bvdv serum negative sheep were intravenouslyinoculated with bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk. an identical inoculation was performed  <dig> weeks later. blood samples were collected weekly from all animals for the assessment of neutralizing antibodies. furthermore, body temperature and development of clinical signs were monitored daily. none of the animals developed fever or other clinical signs during the time of observation . both groups of animals developed an antibody response against bvdv, detectable the second week after the first viral inoculation and reaching the plateau phase at the fourth week post-viral inoculation . antibodies were observable  <dig> weeks following the first viral inoculation and the blood samples were collected before the second viral inoculation. it is therefore possible to conclude that a single inoculation of bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk was able to elicit a humoral immune response against bvdv, in both groups of animals as demonstrated by serum neutralization test .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the establishment and employment of a recombinant bohv- <dig>  expressing a secreted form of bvdv ge <dig>  has been described. the ge <dig> protein plays a major role in virus attachment and entry of bvdv  <cit> . furthermore, bvdv ge <dig> is important for the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against bvdv challenge in cattle  <cit> . in vitro analysis demonstrated that deletion of the transmembrane anchor and addition of a heterologous signal sequence resulted in efficient secretion of ge <dig> into the culture medium. in contrast, full-length ge <dig>  as well as truncated ge <dig> without signal sequence, remained entirely cell-associated. animals immunized with plasmid encoding a secreted form of ge <dig> developed significantly higher igg and virus neutralizing antibody titres compared to animals vaccinated with plasmid encoding a membrane linked ge <dig>  <cit> . starting with this data, we successfully engineerized a eukaryotic expression cassette secreting high levels of ge <dig> into the medium of transfected cells, where the addition of a  <dig> aa non-structured, highly hydrophilic peptide to the c-terminus, significantly increased ge <dig> secretion compared to a less hydrophilic  <dig> aa control peptide. although this  <dig> aa peptide was added to increase ge <dig> secretion, it could be also exploited as a marker to distinguish naturally-infected from vaccinated animals the next step was to vectorialized the expression cassette into a bohv-4-based vector clone as bac. for this purpose, we applied a recombineering system   <cit> , using three λred-encoded genes: exo, bet and gam. exo encodes a 5'-3' exonuclease that produces 3' overhangs from introduced double-stranded dna targeting cassettes . bet encodes a pairing protein that binds to the 3' overhangs and mediates its annealing and homologous recombination with complementary dna present on the bac. at the same time, gam encodes an inhibitor of the e. coli recbcd exonuclease and thereby protects the linear dna-targeting cassette from degradation by recbcd. λred  can be expressed from a multicopy plasmid using an inducible promoter  <cit> . alternatively, these genes can be expressed from a stably integrated defective prophage, where exo, bet and gam are controlled by the strong phage promoter pl, under stringent control of the temperature-sensitive repressor, ci <dig> <cit> . in the prophage system, exo, bet and gam are not expressed when the bacteria are kept at 32°c. by shifting the bacteria to 42°c for as little as  <dig> min, the genes are rapidly induced to very high levels and homologous recombination is very efficient. based on galk selection  <cit> , which we modified by the introduction of a kanamycin resistance expression cassette that drastically improved the background in the first targeting step, we successfully introduced the cmv-igke2- <dig> expression cassette into the bohv- <dig> genome. for homologous recombination, we chose the tk gene as a target site because in other herpesviruses, the tk gene inactivation results in drastic attenuation in vivo  <cit> . viral vector-associated risk is a major concern in viral vector development, and attenuation is regarded as a desirable feature of a viral vector and efforts are directed toward the development of highly attenuated strains  <cit> . however, in the case of bohv- <dig>  the virus naturally exhibits limited or no pathogenicity in both natural and experimental hosts  <cit> . therefore, further attenuation by disruption of genes in addition to tk is neither necessary nor desirable. the resulting recombinant, bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk, has a  <dig> bp tk gene deletion, and the remaining tk gene is interrupted by an cmv-igke2- <dig> expression cassette. reconstitution of the recombinant virus generated here resulted in a recombinant vector in which robust expression of the bvdv transgene was observed in all infected cell lines tested and immunization of rabbits and sheep with bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk resulted in the induction of neutralizing antibodies against bvdv in the absence of an adjuvant and after a single injection dose.

the use of viruses as vectors for the delivery of heterologous antigens needs careful consideration because the immune system has evolved a sophisticated array of mechanisms to both detect and eliminate invading viruses. a viral vector also delivers the antigen directly into the host cell, which allows for high-level intracellular expression. hence, the viral vector acts as an adjuvant and as a delivery system. an effective viral vector should present the expressed antigen as an immune target and should remain in the host long enough to stimulate an effective response. one of the major concerns about vaccine vector development is preexisting antivector immunity in the host organism. in the case of bohv- <dig>  this should not be a problem, because bohv-4does not naturally elicit the production of serum neutralizingantibodies  <cit> .

dna vaccines, like viral vectored vaccines, are capable of raising both humoral and cellular responses, but, unlike live virus vaccines, they are extremely stable and versatile for manufacture and storage. themain limitation of dna-based vaccines remains their low relativeefficacy, requiring multiple boosts with high doses  to generate responses comparable to those achieved from an attenuated virus vaccination  <cit> . bohv- <dig> is an attractive potential vaccine vector in that it establishes persistent infections in its natural bovine host and in an experimental host like the rabbit  <cit> , suggesting that a bohv- <dig> vaccine vector would be particularly useful for long-lasting expression of the heterologous antigen. although bohv- <dig> has been demonstrated in many tissues during persistent infection by pcr, in situ hybridization, or recovery of virus after culture explants, the accumulated evidence suggests that one site of persistence in both natural and experimental hosts is cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage  <cit> . this is probably the most attractive feature of bohv- <dig> in terms of vaccine vector development. since macrophages are both professional antigen-presenting cells and natural targets of bohv- <dig>  the delivered heterologous antigen should be directly processed and presented to the immune system, ultimately leading to an amplification of the immune response after the homing of macrophages persistently infected with bohv- <dig> to lymphoid organs like the spleen and lymph nodes. another feature of bohv- <dig> that makes it a potential gene delivery vector is the lack of evidence for oncogenicity. other gammaherpesviruses like epstein-barr virus , herpesvirus saimiri , human herpesvirus  <dig> , and murine gammaherpesvirus- <dig>  have been associated with the growth-transforming ability  <cit> . in contrast, no evidence for growth-transformation by bohv- <dig> has been obtained  <cit> . each of the genes associated with transformation by other gammaherpesviruses is unique to each individual virus, and homologs are not found in other transforming gammaherpesviruses or bohv- <dig>  <cit> . considerable effort has been directed toward the development of the alphaherpesvirus hsv- <dig> as a vector for gene therapy, especially for the nervous system, because hsv- <dig> is a human neurotropic virus  <cit> . a major disadvantage of hsv- <dig> is its cytotoxicity for many cell types, including neurons, although genetic alterations have been made to reduce its cytotoxicity  <cit> . in contrast, we have previously shown that bohv- <dig> is able to infect a wide variety of cell types, including neural cells and liver cells, without cytotoxicity  <cit> . these observations suggest that bohv- <dig> might have the potential for use as a gene delivery vector for the nervous system and liver. due to the dispensability of many genes, herpesvirus genomes should be able to accommodate at least  <dig> kb of foreign sequence  <cit> . this would enable the use of complex regulatory regions, which, in contrast to the simple cmv enhancer-promoter system which was used, should confer high-level, tissue-specific and developmentally stable gene expression. bohv- <dig> has a similar size genome to those of other gammaherpesviruses, and it is likely that bohv- <dig> could carry significant amounts of heterologous genetic information. like other gammaherpesvirus genomes, the bohv- <dig> genome is established in an episomal state in persistently infected cells  <cit> . integration of the bohv- <dig> genome into the host cell genome is therefore not necessary for maintenance. recombinant bohv- <dig> could theoretically combine the efficiency of a viral delivery system with that of an artificial chromosome, thus alleviating the influence on gene expression of the position of integration into the host genome.

in the present study bohv-4cmv-igke2-14Δtk has been shown to be effective in eliciting the humoral immune response in rabbits and sheep, without any clinical signs, suggesting the possibility to use bohv- <dig> based vector for vaccination of animal species different from the natural bovine host. although the efficacy of a bohv-4-vectored vaccine for bvdv needs to be corroborated by an in vivo challenge study with a pathogenic bvdv in their natural host, the results we obtained in the rabbit and sheep are extremely encouraging.
