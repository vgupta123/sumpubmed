BACKGROUND
whereas the use of recombinant soluble peptide-mhc  molecules for identification of specific t cells has increased dramatically over the last years  <cit> , the reciprocal approach of using recombinant soluble tcrs  for specific detection of peptide presentation and targeting to specific pmhc on cells has proven far more difficult.

a few pmhc specific antibodies have been described, but are often cross-reactive  <cit> . the limitation may be overcome by the use of combinatorial antibody technology as demonstrated for pmhc class i  <cit> . however, neither antibody libraries, nor the full range of specific, recombinant pmhcs required for panning in the selection step, are readily available.

tcrs have evolved to recognize pmhc. they are detection molecules with exquisite specificity, and exhibit, like antibodies, an enormous diversity. soluble tcrs also offer unique opportunities for novel, highly specific therapeutic molecules. different approaches have therefore been taken for production and testing of soluble tcrs, most of which have been derived from established t cell clones of known specificity  <cit> .

soluble tcrs have been produced as heterodimers of α/β chains  <cit> , or as two variable  domains joined in single chain tcrs  of various formats  <cit> . in general however, the development of such molecules is hampered by difficulties associated with low stability causing low expression yields, aggregation of purified proteins and misfolding  <cit> .

in order to increase stability, the tcr v regions have been optimized by amino acid replacements. such replacements have been described that increase the surface hydrophilicity of a sctcr derived from the human rfl  <dig>  tcr  <cit> , or yeast surface display  <cit>  as well as resistance to thermal denaturation  <cit>  of a sctcr derived from the murine 2c tcr.

in some cases, heterodimeric α/β tcrs have been stabilized by a non-native disulfide bridge between the constant  domains  <cit> .

the intrinsic affinity of a tcr for its pmhc is in the lower micromolar range  <cit> . while all tcrs on the surface of a t cell are identical, only a few copies of a particular pmhc are displayed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell. multimerization to increase avidity has therefore been obtained by either indirect capture on beads  <cit> , direct biotinylation and binding to streptavidin  <cit>  or by expressing tcrs on larger particles such as phage  <cit> , viral capsids  <cit> , or cells  <cit> .

tcrs have been fused to other soluble polypeptides, amongst igs, which have a number of advantages as fusion partner since they are naturally secreted, stable molecules. tcr-ig molecules should be secreted and acquire increased stability and binding avidity upon dimerization, and detection of binding to target cells should be facilitated utilizing the vast repertoire of available methods developed for detection of ig. in that way, one might tap into the successful strategies developed for monoclonal antibodies, including widely used purification methodology. in addition, the fc region of tcr-ig fusion proteins may well provide the targeting tcrs with effector functions in vivo, such as prolonged half life and other fcrn mediated effects, as well as the ability to kill target cells by complement activation and binding to fc receptors.

however, early attempts to fuse tcrs to ig domains failed to produce secreted tcrs  <cit> . later, soluble tcr fusion proteins in which both tcr α- and β-chains were fused to simple cκ domains  <cit>  were found to be secreted and recognized by anti-tcr abs. more recently, a sctcr consisting of vα-linker-vβ-cβ was fused to the human igg <dig> constant region  <cit> .

two tcrs have previously been fused to complete igg <dig> and used to stain pmhc on cell surfaces as well as intracellularly after exogenous specific peptide loading  <cit> . we found that such molecules were secreted at very low levels, and therefore explored how select mutations might increase expression. we focused on stabilizing mutations, as no reports exist as to how stabilizing mutations in the tcr v or c domains may affect tcr-ig fusion molecule production and specificity. here, we describe the generation of a panel of tcr-ig fusion proteins based on two different tcrs  that are specific for an ig light chain cdr <dig> id peptide presented on an mhc class ii molecule in a mouse model for autoimmunity and tumour immunology  <cit> . three different fusion formats were investigated.

RESULTS
design of tcr-ig fusion proteins
two different tcrs were fused to ig, namely 4b2a <dig> and 7a10b <dig>  both recognize amino acid 91- <dig> from the λ <dig> light chain of myeloma protein m <dig> presented on i-ed mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . the tcr-ig proteins were made in three different fusion formats . in a first format, the tcr v regions were fused to igg c regions . in two other formats, both v and c tcr domains were included. either, the extracellular domains of the tcrs were fused to a complete igg  or to the igg hinge and fc region . thus, the term "ctcr" refers to the complete extracellular part of the tcr, including v and c regions, whereas "cig" refers to complete ig.

the fusion proteins are secreted from hek 293e cells
genes encoding either tcrv-igc or ctcr-cig were assembled on vectors designed for ig production in mammalian cells as described in materials and methods. for each tcr, both α and β chains were tested for fusion to both heavy and light ig chains, a total of eight constructs. to investigate fusion protein secretion, hek 293e cells were transiently transfected with the genes, and cell supernatants examined in elisa specific for the ig portion of the fusions after two days. low secretion levels were observed in all cases . fusion proteins based on the 4b2a <dig> receptor were secreted at higher levels than those based on 7a10b <dig>  the fusion protein secreted at highest levels  was the 4b2a1-based tcrv-igc construct with the tcr vα domain fused to the heavy chain c region and the tcr vβ domain fused to the light chain c region .

stability engineering of v regions improves secretion
to stabilize the tcr v domains and thus increase secretion levels, amino acids were replaced by site directed in vitro mutagenesis. a large number of mutants were generated and those that increased secretion levels in the actual tcrv-igc format selected. targeted positions have been described  <cit> , and the substitutions tested were: s82r in 4b2a <dig> vα; g17e, h47y, and l80s in 4b2a <dig> vβ; l43p and w82r in 7a10b <dig> vα; as well as q17e in 7a10b <dig> vβ.

the mutations chosen have been identified in the context of the 2c tcr, which contains the vβ <dig>  and vα <dig>  segments. while 4b2a <dig> shares the vβ <dig>  segment, 7a10b <dig> shares vα <dig>  with 2c. thus, when the vj encoded complete v domain sequences are considered, 7b2a <dig> exhibits high homology to 2c vα , while 4b2a <dig> exhibits high homology to 2c vβ .

the mutagenesis reactions were performed such that each gene acquired one or several alterations. all vαh variants were tested in combination with all vβl variants, and the best pair regarding secretion levels from transiently transfected cells identified for each receptor as described in materials and methods. analyses were done on the constructs that were secreted at the highest level in the previous section, namely tcrv-igc with vαh+vβl.

for 4b2a <dig>  the highest protein production was obtained when the wt α-chain was co-expressed with a β-chain that had acquired three mutations, namely g17e, h47y, and l80s. as shown in figure 3a, the mutant fusion protein, denoted  <dig> vmut, was secreted thirteen times better than the wt. for 7a10b <dig>  the selected combination was l43p and w82r in vα together with wt vβ. the protein is denoted  <dig> vmut, and production was increased seventeen fold . thus, amino acid replacements selected to improve the thermodynamic properties of 2c, also improved secretion of 4b2a <dig> as well as 7a10b <dig> 

folding was assessed in elisa with a panel of anti-tcr mabs as coat . gb <dig>  which is specific for 4b2a <dig>  <cit> , and f <dig>   <cit> , for which binding is conformation dependent and specific for the vβ <dig>  segment, were used for 4b2a <dig>  <cit> . 44-22- <dig>  <cit>  and rr4- <dig>  <cit> , both of which recognize the vβ <dig> segment, were used for 7a10b <dig>  the two 4b2a <dig> specific reagents do not recognize 7a10b <dig> and vice versa. in addition, both receptors were tested for binding to an anti-cβ antibody, h <dig>  which does not recognize this format which lacks cβ . importantly, none of the tcrv-igc molecules were recognized by the anti-tcr abs . thus, even though the introduced mutations increased secretion, correct folding was not achieved. we therefore turned to other tcr fusion formats.

stability engineering of c regions improves folding and secretion
comparing the ctcr-cig molecules  for secretion from hek293e cells , both 4b2a <dig> derived molecule were secreted at medium levels. molecules with complete α chain fused to the light chain and complete β chain fused to the heavy chain  showed the best secretion.

the selected v region mutations were then introduced in molecules of the ctcr-cig format derived from both 4b2a <dig> and 7a10b <dig> , the molecules produced in hek293e cells and secretion levels measured by elisa as above. for  <dig> mut , secretion doubled, whereas no change was observed for  <dig> mut . subsequently, the tcr c regions were modified by the introduction of a disulfide bridge between the two c domains  and by replacing an unpaired cysteine in the β-chain with alanine, as previously described  <cit> .

this was done in wt as well as in v region mutated molecules denoted 4wtss, 4mutss a.s.o. for 4wtss, the introduced disulfide bridge did not alter the secretion level. however, when c region mutations were combined with stabilizing v region mutations , protein production was improved five-fold . for 7wtss, secretion increased two fold. there was no additive effect of v and c region mutations for the 7a10b <dig> derived molecule.

folding was assessed in elisa using anti-tcr abs. both  <dig> mut and  <dig> mutss were well recognized by all relevant antibodies . for the corresponding 7a10b <dig> derived receptor , the v region mutations alone did not improve recognition. introduction of the disulfide bridge, however, did. the tcr cβ region specific mab, h <dig>  bound both 4b2a <dig> and 7a10b <dig> derived molecules with the same efficiency as the v region specific mabs.

two fusion molecules that were well recognized by tcr-specific antibodies, namely  <dig> mutss and  <dig> wtss, were secreted at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively . using the ns <dig> myeloma cell line, the production rate was lower, and the supernatants of stably transfected cells regularly contained approximately 1/ <dig> the amount of fusion protein as that of the hek 293e supernatants . in comparison, iggs can be obtained from hek293e cells at  <dig> μg/ml  <dig> days after transient transfection. this prompted us to investigate whether production of tcr-igs could be increased in insect cells.

the fusion proteins are secreted from insect cells
initially, we compared mammalian and insect cell production of the tcrv-igc format. the complete fusion genes were transferred from plnoh <dig> and plnoκ to pac-κ-fc, which is designed for ig production using baculovira and insect cell infection. the fc encoding gene originally in the vector was deleted. both 4b2a <dig> and 7a10b <dig> receptors were tested. we found that the secretion levels doubled in sf <dig> insect cells compared to hek 293e cells . the effect of v region mutations was less prominent, however, and again, the molecules were not recognized by anti-tcr abs .

we then introduced the ctcr encoding genes upstream of the fc region encoded in the pac-κ-fc vector. the 4b2a <dig> receptor, with or without v region mutations as well as with or without c region mutations, was tested, and a total of four different molecules were included in the experiment. in all, the 4b2a <dig> α-chain was fused to the fc region, whereas the β-chain was not part of a fusion. in general, the secretion levels were decreased relative to those obtained in mammalian cells . as for the corresponding proteins produced in hek 293e cells, both v and c region mutations increased anti-tcr ab recognition, and the effects were additive . in conclusion, correctly folded fusion molecules were obtained in insect cells after introduction of v and c region mutations, and the production levels were the same as that obtained in mammalian cells  <dig> days after transient transfection.

the stability engineered fusion proteins bind specifically to pmhc on cells
the molecules  <dig> vmut and  <dig> vwt  as well as  <dig> mutss and  <dig> wtss  were tested for binding to a <dig> cells in flow cytometry. a <dig> is a b cell lymphoma line that expresses the i-ed molecule. we loaded the cells with synthetic λ <dig> peptide and found that  <dig> mutss and  <dig> wtss bound , whereas  <dig> vmut and  <dig> vmut, neither of which bound anti-tcr abs, did not . for both  <dig> mutss and  <dig> wtss, binding was clearly peptide-specific, as pmhc was detected only after addition of peptide. the concentration of fusion protein used, was  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> mutss and  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> wtss, respectively. when reducing the concentration of  <dig> mutss to  <dig> μg/ml, the staining intensity was comparable to that of 7a10b <dig> . binding was also compared to that of a recombinant isotype-matched mab with i-e-specificity  <cit> . for both tcr fusion proteins, staining intensities were comparable to those of the mab . f <dig> cells are a <dig> transfected with λ <dig>  we have previously demonstrated that f <dig> presents the λ <dig> peptide on i-ed and induces proliferation of specific t cells  <cit> .

we tested whether the four molecules could distinguish between a <dig> and f <dig>  binding was not observed to either without addition of exogenous peptide. this shows that the reagent requires further affinity maturation to detect physiological concentrations of agonist peptide.

discussion
fusion to ig might facilitate expression, purification, as well as recognition of soluble tcrs bound to target pmhc. furthermore, fusion of one tcr onto each "arm" of the ig molecule ensures tcr dimer formation in the final tcr-ig molecule, and consequently increased pmhc binding strength due to avidity effects.

recent advances in tcr engineering include the identification of stabilizing mutations in both v- and c regions. we therefore investigated how such engineering affected production and ligand binding properties of two well characterized tcrs fused to ig.

the best domain pairing when the tcr v regions substitute the ab v regions in the tcrv-igc format, vβch/vαcl or vαch/vβcl, may not easily be predicted, since the tcr cα domain deviates from the ig fold and has no clear homology with any of the ig c domains  <cit> . we found vαch/vβcl to be secreted at the highest level when the tcrv-igc format was investigated for production yield.

the tcr v regions were then optimized by amino acid replacements introduced into this tcrv-igc fusion format, as shown in figure 7a for vα and 7b for vβ. tcr 2c and 7a10b <dig> share vα segment, and the two vα replacements that were beneficiary for 7a10b <dig> were first characterized in the context of a sctcr version of the 2c tcr. for 4b2a1vα, the wt sequence was selected, which already contains one of these.

4b2a <dig> and 2c share vβ segment, and all three vβ replacements previously selected in the context of 2c were also selected for 4b2a <dig>  7a10b <dig> utilizes another vβ gene segment, and again, this already contains the beneficiary amino acids.

the effect of the v domain mutations may be studied at the atomic level in the crystal structure of a mutated sctcr version of the 2c tcr   <cit>  and was recently thoroughly analyzed by richman et al.  <cit> . figure 7c shows a ribbon representation of 2c tcr with the five mutated positions highlighted. the vβ segment was clearly well stabilized by the mutations, while the vα segment was not. this emphasizes the need for further stability engineering. such engineering by yeast surface display has been reported for several tcrs of both mouse and human origin  <cit> . the widely versatile phage display technology could develop the engineering beyond its present state by selecting for features such as resistance to aggregation after acid or heat exposure as described for antibodies  <cit> . following initial selection, pools of v domains may be transferred from the displayed sctcr format into a tcr-ig format by the method described here.

folding was analyzed employing a panel of anti-tcr abs with v region specificity, and the results strongly suggested that all detected tcrs were correctly folded. in addition, the c region specific ab h <dig> bound exactly the same molecules as the abs with v region specificity. thus, correct folding of the c domain could be used as an indicator of correct v domain folding, while erroneous v domain folding, when detected, was never a local event, but also affected the c domain. secretion levels from producing cells were not a good indicator of correct folding, however. the tcrv-igc format with tcr v regions and antibody c regions were well secreted, but not properly folded and this was true for both 4b2a <dig> and 7a10b <dig>  the finding is not dependent on the nature of the eukaryotic production system, as the same observations were made whether the molecules were secreted from mammalian cells or from insect cells.

native-like fold was readily reached upon reconstitution of the tcr v-c interphase for 4b2a <dig>  this underscores the importance of this interphase whenever c domains are present in tcrs produced in eukaryotic cells. this also presented the opportunity for introduction of a disulfide bridge linking cα and cβ. the corresponding bridge was first introduced with a positive effect on stability of human tcrs produced in e. coli  <cit> . here we demonstrate that the bridge improved secretion of correctly folded ctcr-cig molecules two  and five  fold, respectively, for murine tcrs. the v-c domain interphase analysis by richman et al.  <cit>  points to important differences in solvent exposure of the v domains in abs and tcrs. in the native 2c tcr, vαw <dig> is burried in the v-c interphase, but is exchanged with a hydrophilic residue in the exposed sctcr version . this hydrophilic substitution also appeared beneficial in 7amut selected in the tcrv-igc format which has the v-c interphase of an ab. in the ctcr-cig format, however, the selected w82r mutation appeared counterproductive.

the fusion proteins were produced in different eukaryotic cells that secrete large proteins in a functional form, with disulfide bridges and glycosylation. hek 293e cells were then chosen for large scale production and functional testing. the vectors used contain the orip sequence that supports increased protein production in hek 293e which express ebv nuclear antigen  <dig>  given frequent changes of growth medium, hek 293e cells will continue to produce protein for  <dig> weeks  <cit> . during this time, the functional tcr-ig fusion molecules could be obtained at  <dig> μg from an initial culture volume of  <dig> ml.

specific binding to pmhc on cells was verified by flow cytometry after addition of the specific λ <dig> peptide. this underscores that the reagents produced are correctly folded and retained specificity, which was the major goal in this study. the reagents, like soluble tcr tetramers, will be very useful for the detection of kinetic stability of complexes of peptide and mhc  <cit> . importantly, a difference in peptide:mhc stability was recently found to be related to autoimmune disease susceptibility  <cit> .

b lymphoma cells that had been transfected with the λ <dig> gene were not detected. we have previously found that this particular transfectant stimulates cloned  <cit>  or tcr-transgenic versions  <cit>  of λ2315-specific t cells. a likely explanation is that the t cell based read-out, with aggregation of pmhcii/tcr in immunological synapses, is rather more sensitive than binding of soluble tcrs as detected in flow cytometry. in addition, coreceptors and costimulatory molecules on t cells do indeed contribute to the former - but not the latter - assay. in previous in vitro experiments, we found that soluble 4b2a <dig> tcrs displayed polyvalently on phage at 3- <dig> copies per particle bound a <dig> loaded with the same specific λ <dig> derived peptide as that used here, but not f <dig>  <cit> . thus, increasing avidity beyond the dimeric ig was not sufficient to detect physiological concentrations of pmhc. it is well known that the intrinsic affinity of a tcr for its cognate pmhc is most often in the lower micromolar range. the affinities of fabs are also low in the primary humoral response. ab binding to antigen occurs due to polymerization to pentamers  in igm in the primary response or affinity maturation in the secondary response. in the case of antigen presentation, the specific pmhc levels are so low that avidity is not going to operate. thus, affinity maturation will be necessary to increase the sensitivity of the soluble tcr-ig fusions to make them useful probes for physiological presentation of pmhc in vitro and in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
manufacturing of stable recombinant ig molecules is well established in a number of systems, and a large panel of reagents for detection of ig exists. the extracellular parts of tcrs on the other hand, are difficult to produce and handle as recombinant soluble molecules, due to low intrinsic stability. recent advances in tcr engineering include the identification of stabilizing mutations in both v- and c regions. we therefore investigated how such engineering affected production and ligand binding properties of two well characterized tcrs fused to ig. without engineering, the molecules were secreted at very low levels from different eukaryotic cells. however, improving the thermodynamic properties by tcr v region mutagenesis and the introduction of a disulfide bridge between the tcr c domains greatly improved yields. most significantly, the engineered molecules bound specifically to pmhc on cells. the reagents will be very useful for the detection of kinetic stability of complexes of peptide and mhc.
