BACKGROUND
aldehydes vary in length and in characteristics of their alkyl chains but all are usually deleterious to biological systems due to their chemical reactivity. aldehyde dehydrogenases  oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids, using nad+ or nadp+ as a co-factor. as such aldhs play an important role in detoxifying aldehydes that are generated endogenously or introduced from the environment. aldhs are very diverse in that some only use either nad+ or nadp+ as the co-factor, while others can use both, some oxidize only a limited number of aldehydes, while others have broader substrate spectra, and aldhs exist in various subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, plastids and microsomes.

over  <dig> aldh genes have been identified across virtually all species, and those from eukaryotes have been classified into more than  <dig> families  <cit> . family  <dig> aldhs are mitochondrial or cytosolic homotetrameric enzymes. the well studied human mitochondrial family  <dig> aldh, aldh <dig>  detoxifies acetaldehyde generated via alcohol intake  <cit> . family  <dig> aldhs in plants have gained attention since the cloning of rf2a gene, a nuclear restorer gene for cytoplasm male sterility in maize, which encodes a mitochondrial family  <dig> aldh, rf2a  <cit> . although the molecular mechanisms associated with the restorer function of the rf2a gene remain to be resolved, several studies in maize and other species have provided clues as to the physiological functions of family  <dig> aldhs in plants.

consistent with the physiological function of human family  <dig> aldh in detoxifying acetaldehyde, liu and schnable  <cit>  demonstrated that acetaldehyde is one of the best substrates in vitro for rf2a, based on the ratio of kcat to km. in addition, one of the mitochondrial family  <dig> aldhs in rice may be responsible for efficient detoxification of acetaldehyde during re-aeration after submergence of rice plants  <cit> . these studies all suggest a role of family  <dig> aldhs during ethanolic fermentation, which is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase  and generates acetaldehyde and ethanol. the detoxification of acetaldehyde by aldh produces acetate. in yeast and mammals, it has been established that acetyl-coa synthetase  can utilize acetate to synthesize acetyl-coa, both in the mitochondria  <cit>  and in the cytosol  <cit> .

the arabidopsis thaliana acs is targeted to the plastid and is encoded by a single gene  <cit> . in plastids acetyl-coa is utilized for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. although the acetyl-coa pool generated by acs from acetate seems redundant for fatty acid biosynthesis, acs is hypothesized to play a specialized role in certain cells and tissues  <cit> . besides, the redundancy of acetyl-coa pool from acs observed above might be due to the low concentration of acetate, probably  <dig>  mm   <cit> . indeed, the feeding of radio-labeled acetate indicates that isolated plastids can use exogenous acetate for fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . to understand how and when acs contributes to the acetyl-coa pool of plastids, the study of acetate biosynthesis would be the key, which is readily diffusible across membranes. one potential pathway would be through aldh utilizing acetaldehyde generated via ethanolic fermentation by pdc from pyruvate or by adh from ethanol.

in yeast, the pdc-aldh-acs pathway  is termed the pyruvate dehydrogenase  bypass and is used to generate acetyl-coa involving both cytosolic and mitochondrial aldhs  <cit> , predominantly when pdh is mutated.  <cit> . in plants, studies conducted in the kuhlemeier lab have demonstrated that high expression of pdc  <cit>  and aldh  <cit>  coincides with high rates of ethanolic fermentation in tobacco pollen.  <cit> . they supplied growing pollen tubes with 14c-ethanol and found label incorporated into fatty acids, indicating that ethanol can be used for fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , presumably via the adh-aldh-acs pathway. to provide direct evidence for the presence of the pdh bypass in plants, this study utilized a reverse genetics approach in arabidopsis to test which  aldhs are involved in the flux from ethanol into fatty acids.

there are three family  <dig> aldhs in arabidopsis  <cit> , one of which, aldh2c <dig> , is localized to the cytosol. one physiological function of aldh2c <dig> is the production of ferulic acid and sinapic acid during lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . the other two aldhs, aldh2b <dig>   <cit>  and aldh2b <dig>   <cit> , are targeted to mitochondria. their physiological functions have not yet been described.

RESULTS
identification of null mutants of the three family  <dig> aldh genes
aldh2b4- <dig> and aldh2b7- <dig> t-dna knockout alleles were identified from the arabidopsis knockout facility at the university of wisconsin. aldh2c4- <dig>  aldh2c4- <dig>  and aldh2b4- <dig> t-dna knockout alleles were identified from the salk institute t-dna insertion library database. t-dna insertion site of each line was confirmed via pcr using a t-dna left border primer coupled with a gene specific primer, either upstream or downstream of the insertion .

the t-dna insertion sites of mutant alleles were determined by sequencing. however as a consequence of the imprecision of t-dna integration, it is not possible to establish the exact insertion positions. only exon/intron positions of the insertions are determined. a jl <dig> was used for lines from the university of wisconsin and lba <dig> for those from the salk institute. b "f" and "r" indicate amplification of insertion alleles using forward and reverse primers, respectively, in combination with t-dna left border primer. "f/r" indicate amplification with both primer combinations.

all of the above alleles are null in that homozygous mutants do not accumulate transcripts detectable by reverse-transcription pcr using template rna isolated from whole plants, while similar template from wild type control plants yielded detectable transcript .

direct evidence for the presence of pdh bypass for acetyl-coa biosynthesis
an ideal experiment to directly test for the presence of the pdh bypass  in plants would be to compare the differences between wild type and mutants of involved genes in the incorporation of 14c-pyruvate or 14c-acetaldehyde into acetyl-coa in plants in which the pdh pathway has been blocked. this is not possible for two reasons. first, blocking the arabidopsis pdh pathway by mutating the e <dig> subunit of the pdh complex results in lethality  <cit> . second, pyruvate is unstable and acetaldehyde is toxic. hence, instead 14c-ethanol was fed to plants that were wild type for the pdh pathway and either wild type or mutant for the aldh genes. the substitution of ethanol for pyruvate or acetaldehyde is appropriate because ethanol should be predominantly, if not exclusively, oxidized to acetaldehyde via adh . because well established means to detect acetyl-coa do not exist, flux through the pdh bypass was measured by determining the incorporation of 14c-ethanol into extracted saponifiable lipids, which should consist primarily of fatty acids  <cit> .

14c-ethanol was fed to whole seedlings, seedling leaves, and inflorescences. the incorporation rates were compared between single or double aldh mutants and their wild type siblings. no differences were detected in whole seedlings or seedling leaves between the aldh2c <dig> homozygous mutants from either allele  and their wild type siblings . we, therefore, conclude that the cytosolic family  <dig> aldh is either not involved in the adh-aldh-acs pathway, or can be compensated for by the mitochondrial paralog.

comparisons were also made using all three tissue sources from the aldh2b <dig> single mutant , the aldh2b <dig> single mutant , the aldh2b4;aldh2b <dig> double mutant and their wild type siblings , all of which were in a uniform ws genetic background . no statistically significant differences in rates of incorporation were observed in seedling leaves among any of the examined genotypes . in contrast, statistically significant differences were observed in whole seedlings and inflorescences . generally, the comparative results among the four genotypes obtained from whole seedlings and inflorescences are similar. in both whole seedlings and inflorescences, the double mutant of the two mitochondrial aldhs  exhibits statistically significant differences relative to the wild type. this demonstrates the role of the mitochondrial aldhs in the incorporation of ethanol and provides direct evidence for the presence of the pdh bypass in sporophytic tissue .

aldh2b <dig> appears to play a more substantial role in this pathway than does aldh2b <dig>  this conclusion is based in part on the observation that in both tissues the aldh2b <dig> single mutant exhibits less incorporation than the wild type. in addition, in both tissues, the rate of incorporation is not statistically different in the double mutant than in the aldh2b <dig> single mutant. hence, there is no evidence to indicate that aldh2b <dig> contributes substantially to this pathway. surprisingly, in both tissues, the aldh2b <dig> single mutant  exhibits more incorporation than the wild type, but only in the inflorescence is this difference statistically significant. this may indicate that in the aldh2b <dig> mutant, the plant responds by increasing the expression of aldh2b <dig>  but this hypothesis remains to be tested.

expression analyses of family  <dig> aldh genes
to understand the expression patterns of the three family  <dig> aldh genes, quantitative real-time pcr  was conducted on rna extracted from different tissues from adult wild-type ws plants. these analyses indicate that aldh2b <dig> and aldh2c <dig> have similar expression patterns, i.e. they are both constitutively expressed in roots, rosette leaves, stems, cauline leaves, flowers and green siliques, with varying levels across tissues; aldh2b <dig> has a different expression pattern, i.e., it is predominantly expressed in flower buds compared to other tissues . qrt-pcr from whole wild-type plants with three to four primer pairs for each gene  showed that in both columbia and ws ecotypes, aldh2b <dig> has a much higher expression level than aldh2c <dig> and aldh2b <dig>  with aldh2b <dig> the lowest , which is also true for most tissue types.

aldh mutants do not exhibit obvious visible phenotypes
no obvious visible phenotypes, including total seed production, plant size, or flowering time, were observed to be associated with any of the single, double or triple aldh mutants when grown in soil or on ms media. these genotypes were also subjected to several stress conditions, but again no obvious phenotypic differences were observed between mutant and wild type plants. tested conditions included oxidative stress , aba treatment , acetaldehyde  or ethanol , cold treatment , heat treatment , hypoxia treatments .

discussion
the pdc-aldh-acs pathway is termed the pdh bypass in yeast  <cit> . studies conducted in the kuhlemeier lab  <cit>  demonstrated that ethanol fed to tobacco pollen can be incorporated into fatty acids, which suggested the presence of the pdc-aldh-acs pathway for generating acetyl-coa for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. analysis of a pdc mutant of petunia provided further support for the expression of the pdh bypass in pollen  <cit> . this study left open, however, the question of whether the pdh bypass functions in sporophytic tissue. we used a reverse genetics approach to compare the incorporation rates of 14c-ethanol into fatty acids in sporophytic tissue  of arabidopsis aldh mutants versus their wild type controls. this study and that of lin and oliver  <cit> , which demonstrated lower incorporation rates in an acs knockout mutant than wild type, provide direct evidence for the presence of the pdh bypass in sporophytic tissue of plants. specifically, lower rates of incorporation were observed in the aldh2b4;aldh2b <dig> double mutant as compared to wild type controls, in both whole seedlings and inflorescences.

the aldh2c <dig> single mutant did not exhibit differences in incorporation relative to wild type. because aldh2c <dig> can oxidize acetaldehyde, at least in vitro  <cit> , this result suggests either that aldh2c <dig> is not required for the pdh bypass or that it is involved in the pdh bypass but its absence can be compensated for by the presence of one or both of the mitochondrial aldhs. of the two mitochondrial aldhs, aldh2b <dig> appears to play a more important role in the pdh bypass pathway in both whole seedlings and inflorescences.

this study establishes the presence of the pdh bypass in whole seedlings, thereby demonstrating that the pdh bypass is not exclusive to pollen  <cit> . this conclusion is consistent with our qrt-pcr results, which show constitutive expression of aldh2b <dig>  on the other hand, the findings that a knockout of aldh2b <dig> has no discernable phenotype and that an acs knockout mutant has only modest effects on plant growth  <cit>  suggests that the pdh bypass is not essential under tested conditions. it is not clear whether the pdh bypass is involved in the biosynthesis of acetyl-coa or the removal of fermentation intermediates. lin and oliver  <cit>  provided evidence for the latter in that their acs knockout mutant is more sensitive to ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate than are controls. surprisingly, there are no obvious visible phenotypes associated with any of the single, double or triple family  <dig> aldh mutants, even though a family  <dig> aldh has an essential role in the development of maize anthers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the pdh bypass, which has previously been shown to be expressed in pollen, can produce acetyl-coa in the absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase . we provide evidence of the existence of the pdh bypass in sporophytic tissue. surprisingly, no obvious visible phenotypes are associated with the triple aldh mutants, which should block this pathway.
