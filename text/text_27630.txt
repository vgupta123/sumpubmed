BACKGROUND
the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  resulting from infection by human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  is arguably the greatest medical and scientific challenge to face humankind in the past decade. more than  <dig> million people worldwide live with the virus, and  <dig> million were infected in  <dig> alone. two thirds of all hiv- <dig> infections occur in sub-saharan africa and the epidemic is still spreading at unprecedented rates  <cit> .

it has been proposed that the only means of halting this epidemic will be the introduction of a large-scale immunisation programme, preferably using cheaply-produced vaccines. there are numerous vaccine initiatives currently in progress globally  <cit> , but the number of different subtypes of hiv- <dig> prevalent in different geographic areas has complicated the prospects for a universal hiv- <dig> vaccine. hiv- <dig> subtype c is the predominant hiv in southern africa; therefore, south african isolates of this subtype have been used in the development of candidate dna and other virally- and bacterially-vectored and subunit vaccines for south africa under the auspices of the south african aids vaccine initiative   <cit> . because of the extent of hiv- <dig> infection in southern africa, any immunisation programme will require enormous quantities of vaccine. dna vaccines are expensive to manufacture, as are recombinant viral and subunit vaccines produced via cell culture. this makes the proposition costly and possibly unfeasible, particularly for the poorer developing countries where hiv infection is prevalent. there is therefore a strong need to develop vaccine expression systems which have the potential to produce vaccines at low cost for these countries.

one of the cheapest possible means of producing subunit vaccines is via plants  <cit> . expression hosts include crop plants such as nicotiana tabacum  and other nicotiana spp., alfalfa, rice, wheat, potato and soybeans, amongst a number of others. different expression systems include transient viral vector expression  <cit> , agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression  <cit> , and the generation of stable transgenic plants  <cit>  or cultured plant cells  <cit>  expressing the protein of interest. the majority of plant-produced recombinant proteins have been produced by transgenic plants, and in many cases, transplastomic plants  <cit> . however, transient expression is a viable alternative: the short production cycle coupled with codon optimisation, suitable promoters and the help of silencing suppressors such as plant virus-derived p <dig> and nss  <cit>  means that it can be scaled up to produce high protein yields in a very short time  <cit> .

there are several advantages to using plant-produced vaccine antigens: there is proper protein folding equivalent to other eukaryotic systems, the raw material cost is lower, the process is highly scalable, large amounts can be produced at relatively low cost, multiple vaccines may be produced together and they may be expressed in edible plant organs, which would make oral delivery convenient  <cit> . however, poor expression levels in transgenic plants and the complex regulatory problems surrounding plant-produced vaccines are the major challenges  <cit> . moreover, reports of inadvertent mixing into the food chain of pharmaceutical proteins from transgenic plants in the usa  <cit>  have put transient plant expression into the spotlight as a bona fide production strategy in its own right.

the hiv- <dig> gag precursor protein pr <dig> gag as well as proteins p <dig>  and p <dig>  resulting from cleavage of pr55gag by the viral protease, are potentially good candidates for the development of hiv subunit vaccines . pr55gag expressed in a variety of cell systems can assemble and bud through the plasma membrane to form highly immunogenic virus-like particles   <cit> . these vlps are non-infectious and morphologically similar to immature hiv particles, stimulate potent cellular and humoral responses, and are safe to administer to animals and humans  <cit> . gag vlps are a promising vaccine candidate because gag contains the highest density of cytotoxic t-lymphocyte  epitopes of any hiv protein  <cit> , and cellular immune responses to gag in infected people are correlated with control of infections; they are highly immunogenic and elicit th1-biased responses in experimental animals at low dosage levels  <cit> ; they are relatively stable, and they can easily be used as carriers for other peptides  <cit> . the native p <dig> facilitates the intra-membrane associations necessary for viral assembly and release  <cit>  as well as being involved in the transport of the viral pre-integration complex into the nucleus  <cit> . it is well-documented that the risk of aids is greatly increased in individuals with falling titres of p <dig> antibodies  <cit> , suggesting that high anti-p <dig> antibody titres might be necessary to maintain a disease-free state. it is also significant that p <dig> and p <dig> together contain the highest density of cytotoxic t-lymphocyte  epitopes of the hiv- <dig> proteome  <cit> . there are also indications that p17/ <dig> fusion proteins may form vlps or tubular structures  <cit> , which could make them a good carrier for immunogenic presentation of foreign epitopes.

studies done on plant-expressed hiv- <dig> vaccines have largely focused on hiv- <dig> env epitopes fused to virus particles or other proteins, to produce chimaeric virus particles which have been tested for their ability to produce an appropriate antibody response  <cit> . a few studies have also been carried out using the tat protein  <cit> . zhang et al.  <cit>  showed that hiv- <dig> p <dig> could be expressed as a fusion protein with tomato bushy stunt virus  capsid protein in tomatoes. however, the inserted p <dig> open reading frame  was not stably maintained. the same researchers subsequently generated stable transgenic n. tabacum expressing the same hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein at levels of  <dig> % of total soluble protein   <cit> . more recently, pérez-filgueira  <cit>  et al. showed that a recombinant tobacco mosaic virus -derived vector expressing subtype c hiv- <dig> p <dig> in n. benthamiana yielded levels of  <dig> mg per kg fresh leaf weight. furthermore, immunisation of rabbits using purified recombinant p <dig> induced a humoral response in inoculated rabbits that was strong and specific to p <dig>  however, there are no studies reported to date on the expression of hiv- <dig> pr55gag or p <dig> in plants, and hiv- <dig> p <dig> is not seen by many as a good vaccine candidate. while its expression in plants has not been investigated, recombinant hiv- <dig> p17/ <dig> fusion protein has successfully been produced in insect cells via recombinant baculovirus  <cit>  for mapping domains involved in vlp formation.

we have previously expressed hiv- <dig> subtype c isolate du <dig> pr55gag via recombinant baculovirus in insect cells, and shown that it assembled and budded to form vlps, and that these were highly immunogenic in mice  <cit> . in this study we explored and compared the use of transient and transgenic plant expression systems for the production of recombinant hiv- <dig> subunit proteins p <dig> and p24/p <dig> as well as of pr55gag and possibly vlps. we investigated the usefulness of codon optimisation and of targeting recombinant proteins to the er and chloroplasts as a means of improving yields, and investigated whether transient expression via recombinant tobamoviruses or agrobacterium tumefaciens produced better yields than the agrobacterium-engineered transgenic system. finally, we assessed both the cellular and humoral immune responses to hiv- <dig> p17/p <dig>  in mice inoculated with this protein, in order to assess the viability of a plant-produced hiv- <dig> vaccine.

RESULTS
tmv vector expression
expressed protein levels measured as μg p24/kg fresh leaf weight using the tmv vector expression system are shown in table  <dig>  expression of full length pr55gag from the wtgag gene was almost undetectable  compared with nicotiana spp. codon-optimised ngag-expressed pr55gag levels, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg p24/kg fresh leaf wt. expressed protein levels from all three versions of the p <dig> gene  were significantly higher  than the p <dig> levels obtained with gag, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg p24/kg fresh leaf wt. although plant-optimised np <dig> expression levels were the highest, with wtp <dig> expressed protein levels being about  <dig>  times and hp <dig> expressed protein levels being at least  <dig> times less, p <dig> levels varied considerably within the specific version tested. despite the low levels of recombinant protein expression, samples of crude plant sap from n. benthamiana infected with the pbsgngag recombinant tmv rna that were immunotrapped with hiv- <dig> p <dig> antiserum and viewed under the electron microscope, showed the presence of vlps approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nm in diameter . these were very similar in shape and size to baculovirus-produced pr55gag vlps  <cit> . plants infected with rtmv expressing p <dig> did not produce any particles . given the very low yield of the pr55gag protein, however, these preliminary results were not followed up.

a. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression
to investigate the possibility of expressing hiv- <dig> p <dig>  p17/ <dig> and pr55gag in plants for vaccine purposes, three sets of constructs encoding cytosol-retained, er-targeted or chloroplast-targeted proteins , were generated and agroinfiltrated into n. benthamiana plants. in addition, the effects of myristylation of p17/ <dig> were investigated, as this is known to affect the accumulation of pr55gag in cells.

all genes were nicotiana spp. codon-optimised

m = myristylated; nm = non-myristylated

the expression of the recombinant proteins pr55gag, p <dig> and myristylated p17/p <dig> was measured using a p <dig> antigen elisa. a comparison of the three transient recombinant protein expression levels in n. benthamiama leaves is shown in column a . in leaf tissue that was syringe-infiltrated with constructs expressing the cytosol-retained proteins, p17/p <dig> was expressed at the highest level compared with expression of both p <dig> and pr55gag which were  <dig> times lower. in leaf tissue infiltrated with er-targeted constructs, p <dig> was expressed at the highest level  when compared with expression of p17/p <dig>  and pr55gag . in leaf tissue infiltrated with chloroplast-targeted constructs, both p <dig> and myristylated p17/p <dig> were expressed at similar levels  when compared with expression of pr55gag . overall, er-targeted p <dig> and chloroplast-targeted p <dig> and p17/p <dig> yielded p <dig> levels which were greater than  <dig> mg/kg fresh weight. the expression of pr55gag was low in all of the targeted intracellular sites. no p <dig> antigen was detectable in plants infiltrated with buffer only as the control.

levels of protein are expressed as μg p <dig> per kg of fresh leaf weight. all genes were nicotiana spp. codon-optimised.

c, er and cpt in construct names indicate whether the protein remained in the cytosol, or was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum or the chloroplast, respectively.

d: regenerants died during transplantation

-: no transgenic plants generated

we separately investigated the effect of removing the myristylation signal on p17/p <dig> expression by comparing g2a-mutated p17/ <dig>  and myristylated p17/ <dig>  protein expression . removal of the signal reduced cytosolic protein accumulation by 9-fold and er accumulation by only ~ <dig> fold, but resulted in  <dig> to 70-fold yield reduction for the chloroplast localised protein when compared to the myristylated version, at  <dig> mg/kg. protein expression for the three non-myristylated p17/ <dig> constructs  was highest in the er , and about the same in cytoplasm and chloroplasts .

the western blot detection of transiently-expressed p17/p <dig> protein in unfractionated leaf extracts is shown in figure 3: the product is clearly visible, as a strong single band of appropriate size, in extracts of plants where protein was targeted to the chloroplasts. in contrast, er-targeted protein is barely visible as a band in adjacent lanes.

hiv antigen expression in transgenic n. tabacum
expressed p <dig> protein levels from transgenic plants are shown in column b . no hiv- <dig> p <dig> protein was detected in non-transgenic control samples. eight transgenic plants expressing chloroplast-targeted p <dig>  were regenerated. the highest p <dig> level measured was about half of that reported for the corresponding transiently-expressed protein. three transgenic plants expressing er-targeted and one expressing cytoplasm-targeted p <dig> were regenerated. expressed p <dig> levels ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/kg fresh leaf wt for np24er and  <dig>  μg/kg fresh leaf wt for np24c.

five putative transgenic plants were generated for ptra-erp17/p24-m and extracts from leaves of these plants shown to have less than  <dig> μg/kg of p <dig> expressed in a preliminary p <dig> elisa screen . eight transgenic lines were generated from ptra-cptp17/p24-m-producing transgenic plants. preliminary screening showed the expression of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> μg p24/kg fw. no transgenic plants were generated from ptra-cp17/p24-m. no product was amplified from control plant genomic dna.

twenty-six transgenic plants expressing chloroplast-targeted pr55gag were regenerated on kanamycin selection medium. recombinant protein levels  were similar to those obtained with the corresponding vectors in the transient expression studies which were generally low: these ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg p24/kg fresh leaf wt. twenty-eight transgenic plants expressing er-targeted pr55gag were regenerated with expressed protein levels ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg p24/kg fresh leaf wt. although there were  <dig> cytoplasm-targeted pr55gag regenerants, these did not survive transplantation and hardening off and we were not able to measure the p <dig> expression levels. overall, pr55gag expression was negligible compared with that of p <dig> and p17/p <dig> 

cellular and humoral response of mice to the p17/p <dig> 
although transiently-expressed er-targeted p <dig>  on its own yielded the highest levels of p <dig> per kg fw , it was decided to carry out immunological studies in mice using the chloroplast-targeted p17/p <dig> protein . from the point of view of developing a candidate vaccine it provides a greater number of epitopes for the induction of a broad immune response. the possibility that this protein may form vlps or tubular structures also supports its use in immunogenicity studies  <cit> . particulate p17/p <dig> protein is proposed to be more effective in stimulating a cellular immune response  <cit> . partially-purified protein extract fractionated by sds-page contained predominantly a single polypeptide of the appropriate size .

the cellular immune response to p17/p <dig> partially-purified leaf protein was investigated in balb/c mice, either alone, or in a prime boost inoculation regimen where the dna vaccine pthgagc was used to prime the immune response and p17/p <dig> protein to boost this response. cellular responses were assayed by ifn-γ elispot and antibody responses by elisa and the specificity of the antibodies confirmed using the new lav blot  <dig> western blot kit.

for all groups of mice the average background responses in the absence of peptide and to an irrelevant peptide was not greater than  <dig> ±  <dig> sfu/ <dig> splenocytes . the strong response to a gag cd8+ t cell peptide of  <dig> sfu/ <dig> splenocytes that was achieved with a single inoculation of pthgagc was increased  <dig>  fold  by a booster inoculation with  <dig> ng of p17/p <dig> protein . no improvement in this response was achieved when the dose was increased to  <dig> ng p17/p <dig> protein. pthgagc induced a weak response just above background to a gag cd4+ t cell peptide, which was significantly boosted  by  <dig> ng p17/p <dig> protein to  <dig> sfu/ <dig> splenocytes . as seen with the response to the cd8+ t cell peptide, a higher dose of p17/p <dig> protein did not increase the magnitude of the immune response to the gag cd4+ t cell peptide. these increases in cellular immune responses to gag induced by p17/p <dig> protein were specific, as there was no significant change in the response to pthgagc when control leaf protein was used as the boost . interestingly, the level of response to the gag cd8+ and cd4+ t cell peptides after a prime with pthgagc and boost with p17/p <dig> protein was similar to that of two doses of pthgagc . the mice in groups  <dig> and  <dig> that were inoculated with the p17/p <dig> protein alone showed no cellular immune response to gag above background,  <dig> days after inoculation .

the humoral arm of the specific immune response to gag for the  <dig> groups of immunized mice was evaluated by looking at serum anti-gag total igg and igg subtypes . significant levels  of gag-specific total igg antibodies and igg subtypes above those in the pre-bleed serum were obtained for groups  <dig> –  <dig> inoculated with either pthgagc or primed with pthgagc then boosted with p17/p <dig> protein .

the high levels of gag-specific total igg in response to pthgagc of  <dig> fold above background  increased  <dig> fold  and  <dig> fold  above background when the mice were boosted with either  <dig> ng or  <dig> ng p17/p <dig> protein respectively . these differences in the level of gag-specific total igg elicited by booster doses of  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng of p17/p <dig> protein were significant  . determination of gag-specific serum igg subtypes indicated the presence of significant  levels of igg <dig>  igg2a, igg2b and igg <dig> above background pre-bleed values . boosting pthgagc primed mice with pthgagc or  <dig> ng leaf protein containing p17/p <dig> protein induced higher igg2a than igg <dig> levels whereas boosting with  <dig> ng p17/p <dig> protein reversed this ratio . no gag-specific antibodies above that in the pre-bleed serum were obtained for groups  <dig> –  <dig> inoculated with either dose of p17/p <dig> protein or control leaf protein .

a commercial western blot system for determining hiv- <dig> antibodies confirmed the presence of antibodies to gag in the serum of inoculated mice . in addition, judged from the intensity of the bands on the strips, the ability of p17/p <dig> to boost the antibody response induced by pthgagc is clearly visible.

discussion
our group has previously investigated the suitability of a baculovirus-expressed hiv- <dig> pr <dig> gag virus-like particle  preparation as a candidate hiv vaccine, in combination with a dna gag vaccine  <cit> . part of our objective in this study was to investigate the feasibility of expressing the same gene in plants via recombinant tmv as a cheaper means of making vlps. while a plant codon-optimised version of the gene produced a pr55gag protein which apparently formed recognisable vlps , the yield of protein was extremely low. we investigated whether yield could be improved by truncation or differential localisation of the protein, and showed that sequences downstream of the p <dig> orf negatively affected expression, given that either p <dig> or p17/ <dig> proteins were expressed relatively well, both in transient and transgenic expression systems. interestingly, while expression of the gag-derived genes used here did benefit from plant codon optimisation, unlike our group's earlier experience with human papillomavirus type  <dig>  l <dig> protein expression  <cit> , as in that work we found that determination of best intracellular locale for transient protein accumulation was strictly empirical. thus, while pr55gag accumulated similarly poorly in all locations, and p <dig> accumulated negligibly in cytoplasm and significantly better in both the er and chloroplasts, p17/p <dig> yield was similar in cytoplasm and er and 20-fold better in chloroplasts. transgenic expression presented a different picture: cytoplasmic targeting of pr55gag resulted in regeneration failure, indicating toxicity; er-targeted p <dig> did not accumulate well, although chloroplast targeting was equivalent to transient expression, and p17/p <dig> again accumulated best in chloroplasts, but to 20-fold lower levels than in transient studies.

we then investigated the feasibility of expressing hiv- <dig> p17/ <dig> – a truncated gag, but a more appropriate vaccine candidate than p <dig> – in nicotiana spp. at levels suitable for processing for vaccine manufacture. we showed that transiently expressing the transgene under the camv 35s promoter produced the highest protein yields, up to  <dig> mg/kg . the protein seemed to be relatively stable in these studies; however, results from transgenic plants showed higher recombinant protein yields in the young leaves than in the older, suggesting active turnover in the leaves rather than passive accumulation – in contrast to results for production of hpv- <dig> l <dig> protein  <cit> . the result clearly demonstrated that transient expression, and in particular, targeting the protein of a nuclear gene to the chloroplast, results in the best yield of recombinant p17/p <dig> 

the protein yields reported in this study were below the expected economic threshold . however, our laboratory has shown that up to  <dig> mg of hpv- <dig> l <dig> protein per kg fresh weight  can accumulate in the chloroplasts of tobacco plants  <cit> , meaning there is potential for much higher level accumulation.

although results from electron microscopy were inconclusive it could be speculated that the hiv- <dig> p17/ <dig> protein might form stable structures and possibly virus-like particles , or tubules as reported by  <cit> . the myristylation site on the native pr55gag protein is essential for targeting the hiv- <dig> pr55gag protein to the plasma membrane: it is possible that myristylated p17/ <dig> associates with the chloroplast membranes to make higher-order structures, and that non-membrane associated protein is toxic, which could account very well for the drastic difference in yield of the native and non-myristylated versions of p17/p <dig> . it is also possible that the membrane-associated form could be useful as a carrier for epitope presentation through c-terminal fusions, as is the full pr55gag protein made in insect cells  <cit> . in any case, further investigations are needed to characterise the nature of the structure formed from the protein described here, and also its immunogenicity, if it is to be used as a candidate hiv- <dig> vaccine.

this study focussed on the immune response of mice to the leaf protein containing p17/p <dig> protein and was set up as proof of concept that plant-produced hiv proteins could possibly be further developed for candidate vaccines. as several studies have indicated enhanced immune responses can be achieved by heterologous prime-boost inoculation regimens, we chose to investigate the immune response of p17/p <dig> alone and its ability to boost an immune response to a dna vaccine pthgagc that is known to prime an immune response of mice, which can be effectively boosted by pr55gag vlps  <cit> . indeed, the substantial boost by leaf protein containing p17/p <dig> protein of gag-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by the dna vaccine pthgagc suggests that hiv proteins produced in plants may be very valuable for expanding immune responses after the immune system has been primed. while both cd8+ and cd4+ vaccine-specific t cells have a protective role, cd4+ t cells are potentially important for the induction and maintenance of cd <dig> memory cells and stimulation of b cells for antibody production  <cit> . we found the increase in gag-specific cd4+ t cells induced by the boost with p17/p <dig> protein is associated with a substantial increase in the gag-specific humoral responses and a progression in an igg <dig> to igg2a isotype switch. even though we did not measure gag-specific th1–th <dig> responses, the igg isotypes suggest our prime-boost inoculation regimen induces a mixed th1–th <dig> response with low doses of p17/p <dig> inducing more of a th <dig> response, which changes to a greater th <dig> type response when higher doses of p17/p <dig> are used. although the inoculation with p17/p <dig> protein alone was not immunogenic in mice, we may find if we use a higher dose with homologous boosts or adjuvant, that a gag-specific immune response is induced. results obtained using a classic western blot strip assay for hiv antibodies also showed a clear boosting of the dna-induced response, apparently to a greater degree than obtained by dna prime-dna boost .

our results highlight the potential of transient expression in plants for the production of hiv-l vaccine-relevant proteins. until recently, transient expression through agrobacterium-mediated infiltration was generally used only to verify gene expression, and to validate small amounts of recombinant proteins. however, it is now considered a genuine protein expression strategy in its own right that can potentially yield large amounts of protein  <cit> . additionally, the short production cycle can reduce costs considerably compared to the equivalent transgenic case. the use of post-transcriptional silencing suppressors such as p <dig> and nss  <cit> , as well as increased protein stability after targeting proteins to cellular organelles, can further enhance the expression level. furthermore, technologies have been developed to extract and purify antigens produced in plants for use in multi-component vaccines or immunogenic presentation of epitopes on vlps or virions  <cit> .

while many studies have been done to establish the potential of transplastomics for recombinant protein production, information on the use of plastid targeting tags such as rbsc1-ctp in pharmaceutical protein production is limited. however, a possible advantage lies in the fact that translation of the targeted proteins occurs in the cytoplasm, and then the proteins are imported into chloroplasts: when they are inside the chloroplast, the targeted proteins are then folded correctly,, making them more appropriately immunogenic. using transit peptide tags might therefore overcome the limitations of using transplastomics, which include product insolubility, a lack of post-translational modifications, less established chloroplast transformation protocols and biosafety concerns of the horizontal transfer of transgenes from chloroplasts of transplastomics to bacteria under lab conditions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we determined that it was feasible to produce vaccine-relevant hiv- <dig> subtype c gag-derived proteins in plants of nicotiana spp. by means of transient expression via recombinant a tumefaciens, rather than via rtmv or transgenic expression. we demonstrated the positive effects on protein yield of plant codon optimisation, specific intracellular targeting, and protein composition. in particular, a p17/p <dig> fusion protein accumulated to relatively high levels in chloroplasts, was relatively easily partially purified from plants, and could be used to significantly boost both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice previously injected with an hiv dna vaccine. this is the most vaccine-relevant hiv protein so far expressed in plants, and could have considerable potential.
