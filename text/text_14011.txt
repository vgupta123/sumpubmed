BACKGROUND
most quantitative phenotypes or disease susceptibility factors are complex traits that are the result of interplay between genetic variation and environmental exposure. in animal genetics, many quantitative trait loci  have been described as components of genetic variation in muscle physiology, disease resistance, and reproduction traits  <cit> . but positional cloning of polymorphisms underlying those qtls is a long process, as is understanding the molecular cascades that lead to the phenotypes observed. the identification of expression qtls  should help to characterize the primary effects of genetic variation and provide opportunities to understand the molecular processes that are affected by this variation. genes whose transcripts are affected by these eqtls do not necessarily embed causative polymorphisms, but the distribution of eqtl localizations joined to transcript correlation structure enables functional groups of genes to be defined  <cit> . variation in gene expression is thought to be responsible for a large part of the phenotypic variation observed in natural populations. changes in gene regulation have been found to underlie adaptative phenotypes in different species  <cit> . for all these reasons, eqtl mapping studies is a new powerful tool to identify genetic variants that regulate gene expression  <cit> . transcriptome analysis using microarrays measures the expression level, the phenotype in eqtl analysis, of many genes, and segregation of genetic markers within families allows mapping of the loci affecting those phenotypes to specific genomic regions. global eqtl analyses have enabled detection of cis genetic variation controlling individual genes and significant clustered trans eqtls that regulate group of genes  <cit> .

muscle is a highly organized and complex tissue whose properties are likely to be determined at different levels. in farm animals, muscle fiber characteristics play a key role in meat quality. myofibril type ontogenesis occurs during the embryonic period and continues until the early postnatal period in the largest species  and the total number of fibers is fixed. contractile and metabolic differentiations occur soon after birth in pig  <cit> . in mammals, post-natal muscle tissue constitutes about 50% of the body mass and enables high potential of plasticity in response to metabolic variation   <cit> . this plasticity corresponds to the possibility of changes in gene expression in response to rapid environmental events, or with remodeling, the renewal of muscle cells as satellite cells  <cit> . consequently, muscle is one of the best examples of a tissue with an inherent adaptation capacity to sustain not only locomotion but also a number of life-sustaining processes  <cit> .

other authors have explored eqtl mapping in pig  <cit> . cardoso et al.  presented a simulated data to describe a way to design pig eqtl experiment and to select animals for eqtl mapping. ponsuksili et al.  explored eqtls associated with water holding capacity, an important meat quality trait  <cit>  and recently reported on a global comparative analysis between eqtls and several meat quality traits  <cit> . in a qtl project for expression profiling, steibel et al.  analyzed eqtls obtained with  <dig> f <dig> animals chosen for their extreme phenotypes for either loin muscle area or backfat depth. these authors compared the eqtl and the qtl results to identify candidate genes  <cit> .

the aim of our study was to analyze muscle eqtls in one f <dig> family without preselecting trait-associated gene expression levels. using muscle samples from  <dig> half sibs, we identified  <dig> eqtls that characterize genetic variation in the expression levels of  <dig> genes. moreover, the overlapping genomic localization of eqtls and some transcribed genes suggests candidate genes for embedding cis-acting causative polymorphisms. alternatively, clustered trans-eqtls genomic regions can define sets of genes potentially affected by the same genetic polymorphisms through shared cellular functions.

RESULTS
the expression levels of  <dig> genes are genetically regulated by one to four eqtls
using a cdna microarray, we measured the expression levels for  <dig>  transcripts in  <dig> longissimus lumborum samples collected on pig carcasses  <dig> minutes after stuning and exsanguination. heritability of expression levels was estimated to select transcripts for which the expression level is driven by inherited factors  and to enable a qtl segregation to be tested against a polygenic additive only model . heritability of at least 5% was estimated for  <dig>  of these transcripts which were then analyzed for qtl detection. the large proportion of transcripts for which the estimate additive variance was not significant  reflects  rna species with little or no variance, and  the limited power of our design, where, in contrast to paternal haplotype segregation, the estimation of additive variance is only possible for the dam side. the average heritability across the  <dig>  transcripts deemed heritable  was of  <dig>  .

analysing qtls that affected expression of  <dig>  transcripts deemed heritable, we detected  <dig> eqtls, significant at a chromosome-wide threshold of 1%, that regulate the expression of  <dig> genes. details of eqtl detection including maximum lrt, most likely position on the genetic map and estimated heritability are given for each of the  <dig> transcripts with identified eqtls in additional file  <dig>  accounting for the large number of tests performed  using a canonical transformation of traits suggests an overall false discovery rate of 15% . the 1% chromosome-wise thresholds for lrt are listed in additional file  <dig>  the average heritability was of  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  for the  <dig> transcripts with at least one significant eqtl.

additional file  <dig> presents all the  <dig> lrt values and additional file  <dig> summarizes the loci identified as affecting the expression level for the  <dig> transcripts. lrt values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  also list the number of genes whose expression was shown to be genetically regulated by loci localized on each chromosome; e.g. the expression of  <dig> genes was genetically regulated by at least one gene on ssc <dig> 

the number of eqtls is given for each chromosome. this number is in bold when the chromosome level is significantly high . the position of the clusters is given in cm .

the  <dig> genes were affected by one to four significant eqtls each: one gene was associated with four significant eqtls,  <dig> genes with three significant eqtls,  <dig> with two eqtls, and  <dig> with only one eqtl.

gene mapping and annotation revealed mainly trans-eqtl and few cis-eqtl
knowing the chromosomal localization of genes is essential in an eqtl study. mapping and annotations are described in methods and results are summarized in additional files  <dig>  and  <dig> . most of the transcripts  were directly localized on the pig genomic sequence . for 88% of the transcripts, we obtained an alignment with a bac sequence, which, excepted for five transcripts, was localized on pig chromosomes allowing  <dig> more transcripts to be localized on chromosomes. this enabled a total of  <dig> transcripts to be localized on pig chromosomes .

as a result of gene annotation, 71% of the transcripts were annotated . annotation results are given in additional file  <dig> and details in additional file  <dig>  we observed a low redundancy with  <dig> unique genes out of the  <dig> genes annotated .

the final important information provided by gene and eqtl mapping was the identification of eqtls colocalized with gene transcription units, i.e. cis-eqtl. identifying of cis-eqtl is not easy, owing to the very large confidence intervals associated with each eqtl. to compare respective eqtl and gene localizations, we had to assign both locations to common reference coordinates. practically speaking, we used genome assembly as a common reference, having localized the position on the genome assembly  of the sts genetic markers used to build the genetic maps . we considered as putative cis-eqtls those where genetic markers flanking the most likely eqtl position on the genetic map also bracketed the gene position on chromosome. this condition applied to a total of  <dig> eqtls and affected the trancription of the following genes: eef1a <dig>  coq <dig> and cr <dig> on ssc1; ik and pdlim <dig> on ssc2; mdh <dig> on ssc3; pcbp <dig>  hnrnpa <dig>  mgp and emg <dig> on ssc5; tmem <dig> on ssc6; eapp on ssc7; thyn <dig> on ssc9; aldh <dig> and actn <dig> on ssc14; bx <dig> and ocln on ssc16; and loc <dig> on ssc <dig>  the average distance between a gene and the eqtl closest bracketing marker was  <dig>  mb . some of these cis-eqtls were isolated, such as loc <dig>  and some others  are co-localized with clusters of trans-eqtls.

ontological and functional description of the eqtls
a functional annotation of the genes identified as being genetically regulated in muscle tissue should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that determine the muscle phenotypes. in this study, we did not preselect genes, e.g. genes differentially expressed for one trait. all  <dig> genes analyzed for function were identified solely on the basis of their expression being affected by one of the eqtls identified in muscle tissue.

as a consequence of partial gene annotation, only  <dig> genes were practically used for the functional analysis. two approaches were used to explore the biological functions regulated by the genes involved in these eqtls. first, we used a systematic ontologic analysis with the ease software. ontologic  annotations were obtained for  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes had a kegg pathway annotation. the systematic results of the gene ontology and the kegg pathways are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> genes regulated by at least one eqtl were analyzed using the ipa software . ipa took into account  <dig> genes for the enrichment analysis of biological functions . twenty-eight biological functions were identified . the pie chart in figure  <dig>  shows the functions organized by category from cell death to biochemistry. the most significant functions concern lipoprotein lipase deficiency just before cell death, cell morphology, stress response, transcription and translation, and other more muscle specific functions.

among the  <dig> genes, ipa identified  <dig> as "network elligible" to propose biological networks based on bibliographic data . ipa constructed three highly significant networks. the first network had a score of  <dig> , the second network had a score of  <dig> , and the last had a score of  <dig> . the three networks are presented in additional file  <dig> . the top biolological functions associated with the three networks were the muscle development and physiology , cell metabolism , cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction , and protein synthesis and post-translational modification . these three networks included 80% of the genes identified as network elligible  by the ipa software, then suggesting that these genes, which where not selected according to a specific trait or physiological function, nevertheless reflected shared biological functions. this might be understood as if the largest components of the genetic regulation of gene expression in this tissue and sampling condition do not necessarly reflect muscle ontology or physiology associated functions but instead are depicting the most regulated cell functions at sampling point, where gene expression regulation appears as a coordinated cell response to environmental challenges. moreover, a combined large network  was constructed with the three networks with some genes/eqtls shared by two networks: acox <dig>  csde <dig>  ocln, pabpn <dig>  pik3ap <dig> joined networks  <dig> and  <dig>  csde <dig> joined networks  <dig> and  <dig>  while csde <dig>  neb, smarcc <dig> joined networks  <dig> and  <dig> 

the low proportion of genes with functional annotation found in clusters prevented us from performing a significant functional annotation within each cluster. for example, one of the largest clusters containing  <dig> eqtls on chromosome  <dig>  included only  <dig> genes with functional annotation. an alternative indirect way to infer a putative common regulation of genes included in the same cluster of trans-eqtl would be to assess the relationships between the estimated eqtls effects for the different levels of expression involved. this might not include all cases of shared genetic determinism  but nonetheless might highlight the easiest case of a parallel response to the same polymorphism. accordingly, we visualized the correlation structure among the individual eqtl effects predicted for these  <dig> transcript levels  at a median position  and observed that  <dig> of these transcripts were affected by highly correlated eqtl effects . the mean of pearson correlation coefficients among the eqtl effects affecting these  <dig> transcripts levels was  <dig> . the corresponding residuals from the same analyses  showed substantial but lower correlations between the transcripts involved . moreover, the combination of concentration ellipses and loess smoothing  summarizes the linear and possibly nonlinear association underlying the complexity of molecular regulation we were searching for  <cit> .

within the 129- <dig> cm interval on chromosome  <dig> where four putative cis-eqtls co-localized with a smaller group of trans-eqtls, the correlogram of predicted eqtl effects at the  <dig> cm mid-cluster position revealed two functional groups of transcripts, where correlated eqtl effects are affected the expression of pcbp <dig>  hnrnpa <dig>  kctd <dig>  and emg <dig>  while mgp, mgst <dig>  and tacc <dig> are affected by a distantly related set of correlated eqtl effects . the mean of absolute values of pearson correlation coefficients among pcbp <dig>  hnrnpa <dig>  kctd <dig>  and emg <dig> eqtl effects was  <dig>  . the mean of absolute value of pearson correlation coefficients among mgp, mgst <dig>  and tacc <dig> eqtl effects was  <dig>  .

discussion
a total of  <dig> genes are genetically regulated in muscle tissue with an average heritability of  <dig>  in a f <dig> pig half-sib family
the specific interest of this work was first focusing on global gene expression regulation without prior selection of transcripts for association with a particular trait, and second using a family structured population that enabled genetic analysis. we observed differences in heritability estimates between the group of  <dig>  transcripts subjected to qtl analysis  and trancripts affected by the eqtls identified . this is consistent with the expectation that significant qtl contribute to polygenic additive variation estimates even when this is not the best possible model. the size of our dataset limited the power of detection and it is likely that we were not able to detect all the loci involved in the regulation of gene expression. in a review of genetical genomics studies done with snp and genome wide associations, cookson et al.  observed that the qtl underlying genetic variability of expression is often detected for only less than 20% of the estimated trait heritability  <cit> . cookson et al. explained that some genetic or other factors like family clustering, sample stratification and genetic markers informativity are limiting the power to detect other loci. nevertheless, the starting point is that variation of expression is not only a result of transcriptional regulation but also of genetic regulation in order to explain part of the phenotypic variability in a constant environment.

another original choice was using tissue rna sampled in individuals from an outbred population  to analyze genetic regulation of gene expression. most published eqtl studies used inbred lines of model organisms and gilad et al.   <cit>  suggested that it would be more informative to evaluate regulation of expression in populations carrying natural sources of genetic variation. example of such representative genetic variability could be found in human populations, outbred mice  <cit>  or, to a lesser extent, pig lines . in our work, it is worth noting that this f <dig> family was constructed from two synthetic lines  intercrossed for two generations in order to increase the segregation of genetic variability in f <dig> animals. all animals analyzed were raised in the same conditions, allowing us to control the effect of the environment, while exploring a physiological context  which is very specific of meat harvesting in livestock animals raised for meat but which could be also considered as an animal model of ischemia in skeletal muscle. in human, the first eqtl studies orginally focused on transformed lymphocyte cell lines . new studies have been undertaken on clinical samples of liver, adipose tissue, postmortem brain  <cit> , although sample access and standardization remains limiting. animal studies in outbred populations offer an attractive combination of standardized environment, large family sizes allowing linkage studies and more easily accessible tissues.

the  <dig> eqtls are mainly trans-eqtls revealing genes with shared biological functions
in our study, we based the precise localization of the transcribed genes on highly reliable sequence homologies of cdna used as probes on the genome sequence . it is also worth noting that the method we used to quantify gene expression, which is based on cdna microarray hybridization, is relatively immune to artefactual cis-eqtl identification  <cit>  where dna polymorphisms such as snps can modify the hybrization efficiency of oligo probes and lead to an apparent change in gene expression, in fact contributed by these loci. in these conditions, we identified a small proportion of putative cis-eqtl  like in a recent comparable study on pig muscle reported by ponsuksili et al.  where  <dig> putative cis-eqtls were identified  <cit> . an observation common to our and other eqtl studies is that the significance of detection is generally higher for cis-eqtl than for other eqtls. in our study, the highest lrt value was found for a putative cis-eqtl loc <dig> on ssc <dig>  this was expected as cis-eqtls are supposed to transfer the contribution of a given genomic polymorphism directly to local gene expression, and not indirectly via actions that occur along pathways or via gene interactions, all of which can create background noise thus hindering the detection of qtl. this was also the case in eqtl studies in mouse, rat and human  <cit>  using very large oligo arrays for gene expression measurements and large sets of snps genetic markers in which multitesting to avoid false discovery mainly highlighted highly significant cis-eqtls and few trans-eqtls. this is a powerful way to directly identify snp polymorphisms as putative regulators of local gene expression but it does not provide information on the architecture of gene and molecular pathway regulation.

in genetic analysis of physiology and pig meat quality traits, many qtls have been reported but few led to the identification of genes and causal polymorphisms mainly because of the complexity of trait determinism and epistatic regulations  <cit> . this is why we hoped that eqtl studies would help to decipher how this complexity is established. in this context, it was interesting to identify eqtl for genes without prior selection and to identify only six clusters of trans-eqtls suggesting a shared genetic regulation , but also that the expression levels of some genes are regulated by more than one eqtl.

constructing bibliographic gene networks , we obtained three highly significant networks for  <dig> genes  suggesting that the genes identified for their genetic regulation mostly work together . moreover the three networks can be merged into a single network underlying the shared biological functions regulated by these eqtls/genes . networks  <dig> and  <dig> mainly underlie the development and organization of muscle tissue whereas network  <dig> is involved in cell metabolism. we were not able to allocate a specific cluster of trans-eqtls to one network or vice versa to be able to say that one network is specifically regulated by one or more clusters of eqtls. likewise, as discussed below in the case of the cluster of eqtls on chromosome  <dig> , the low number of annotated genes per cluster did not allow us to really perform functional analysis of each cluster.

however, we performed enrichment analysis of the biological functions regulated by ipa . among the top biological functions identified, the cell cycle and death  were the major functions identified. forty-seven genes  are involved in cell death . this may be related to the way muscle tissues were sampled  and may be correlated with the effect of stress, which was the second top function identified. these functions were previously considered as related to meat quality traits  <cit>  and stress is well known to be responsible for meat defects  <cit> . some biological functions are related to the organization of muscle cells and tissue including connective tissue, focal adhesion, filaments, and vascularization. others are more related to muscle signal transduction pathways like the quantity of heavy metals, phosphatidic acid and calcium flux. fundamental molecular processes such as degradation of dna, mrna processing, protein biosynthesis and modification are also involved.

the genetic regulation of muscle gene expression by the 133- <dig> cm locus on chromosome  <dig> is involved in stress response
to explain the genetic regulation of a cluster of eqtls, we use the example of one of the largest cluster in our study. it concerns chromosome  <dig> at locus 133- <dig> cm which regulates the expression of  <dig> genes . the bibliographic network of this cluster involved nine genes that shared the biological function cell death , obtained with ingenuity software, including coq <dig> a putative cis-eqtl co-localized with the cluster. we explored the correlation structure of gene expression of members of this eqtl cluster to identify possible coregulations and to distinguish between groups of genes affected  by the same genetic variation . this observation suggests a shared genetic determinant affecting  <dig> transcripts levels out of the  <dig>  while above and beyond eqtl effects, the overall phenotypic correlation would be consistent with co-regulation of these transcripts in the same pathway or transcriptional network. this would imply parallel responses not only to an eqtl allele, but also to all alternative genetic and environmental effectors that affect this expression network. this analysis also highlighted functional heterogenity within a group of co-localized eqtls, where colocalization can result not only from multiple transcripts affected by the same locus, but also from independent genetic effets localized on the same chromosome segment.

nevertheless, we observed that expression of most of the genes in the cluster was highly correlated among genes and particulary with coq <dig>  in this context, the putative cis-eqtl coq <dig>  can be proposed as a candidate primary effector of an identified eqtl locus, affecting the whole group of transcripts downstream. this was not originally expected firstly because of the co-localization of eqtls within a cluster could be random, and secondly because if gene expression is influenced by shared genetic regulation, this is far from implying a tight coregulation owing to alternative sources of regulations from the environment or from other loci for each gene. gene coq <dig> is located in the same genetic interval  and has recently been identified in human  <cit>  as coding for one of the coenzyme q  proteins, which are small lipophilic molecules that transport electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and function as a cofactor for mitochondrial enzymes  <cit> . human coq <dig> is an interesting candidate gene for patients with coq <dig> deficiency or with developing isolated myopathy with progressive muscle weakness  <cit> . in pig, several qtls were detected for fatness and growth at the position of the cluster  <cit> . the results of these different studies suggest that the cluster of eqtls on chromosome  <dig> probably regulate cell death via mitochondrial respiratory function and subsequently muscle physiology. coq <dig> could be an interesting candidate gene for further experiments to characterize alleles and how this allelic variation is affecting coq <dig> gene expression and possibly muscle functions.

two putative cis-eqtls are regulated by ssc <dig> and are tightly flanking the hoxc cluster
rna levels of two genes, pcbp <dig> and hnrnpa <dig>  were found to be genetically determined by two co-localized eqtls, along with their own transcription unit , on the same segment of the distal arm of chromosome  <dig> . these two eqtls are part of a larger group of eqtls at the same location  where the two transcripts form a distinct transcription module as evidenced by the eqtl effects on these rna levels . it is striking that among the small number of cis-eqtls found in our experiment, two were located in at neighboring positions and were co-regulated. this suggests shared dependence of the same cis-localized polymorphism through a transcription control mechanism acting locally. this is in contrast with the mechanism which is generally expected in clusters of trans-eqtls, where a causative polymorphism may affect the downstream expression of a target gene and this gene, e.g. transcription factor, affect the expression of the other genes involved in the cluster.

the two genes tightly flank the hoxc cluster . it has been reported that the hoxa and hoxc clusters are involved in the control of adult skeletal muscle differentiation  <cit>  and although hoxc genes were not identified as eqtl co-segregating at this particular position, hox genes are prototypes of multigenic cis-regulatory modules  <cit> . the cis-regulon observed in our study brackets the hoxc cluster, whereas evolutionary analysis  <cit>  points to the consolidation of hox clusters in vertebrates through selection of cis-regulons as better co-regulation systems. it is tempting to speculate that the flanking genes identified here were co-opted by a local cis-regulon including the hoxc cluster to drive an adult skeletal muscle differentiation program. all the more, as reviewed by williams et al. , pcbp <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> are plausible sites of action for genetic determinants of mrna levels  <cit> . these two genes are known to be heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins . hnrnpa <dig> is involved in pre-mrna processing, polya+ mrna transport from nucleus to cytoplasm and alternative splicing control  <cit> . pcbp <dig> is a poly binding protein known to control translation of specific mrna through competitive binding of c-rich tracts in target genes 5'utr and mir- <dig>  <cit> . pcbp <dig> has been shown to provide for selective expression of cell survival factors  <cit> . these functions may support control of a cell differentiation program linked to a stress response.

CONCLUSIONS
identifying the genetic regulation of gene expression is a new powerful way to decipher complex traits such as mammalian disease or livestock production traits. we can now describe phenotypic variations not only through genetic analysis, not only with differentially expressed genes but also with genetic analysis of gene expression of thousands of intermediate phenotypes. integrated analyses across all these data types may help to more efficiently and more accurately identify causative polymorphisms or understand the molecular events involved in phenotype construction even when these are affected by several qtls  <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> eqtls of which half co-localized at six loci, suggesting co-regulation by the same polymorphims and subsequently, co-functions. the other half of the eqtls provide information about the genetic control of the expression of specific genes. in addition, all the affected genes participate in a consistent set of biological functions, since when functionnal annotation is possible, functionnal networks can be contructed.

beside the analysis of genetic variability in gene expression presented here, this systematic dataset will also offer opportunities in a priori analysis of expression levels correlations structure as for example inferring co-expression networks  <cit> . in future experiments, we expect to be able to combine trait-related gene expression and qtl analysis to propose positional candidate genes as underlying trait qtl and contribute to the identification of the causative polymorphisms.
