BACKGROUND
the genome projects have increased our knowledge of genomic sequences for several organisms. taking advantage of this knowledge, the microarrays technologies allow the characterization of a whole-genome expression by showing the relative transcript levels of thousand of genes in one experiment  <cit> . numerous applications were developed apart gene expression analysis like single nucleotide polymorphism  and genotyping  <cit> , diagnosis  <cit>  and comparative genomics  <cit>  analysis. particularly, the transcriptome analysis provides insight into gene regulations and functions. to help the characterization of relevant information in microarray data, specific computational tools are needed. the identification of co-expressed genes is commonly performed with unsupervised approaches, such as clustering methods with the hierarchical clustering   <cit> , the k-means  <cit>  and the self-organizing map   <cit> , or with projection methods such as the principal component analysis   <cit>  and independent component analysis   <cit> .

among these techniques, the hc approach is a widely held method to group genes sharing similar expression levels under different experimental conditions  <cit> . the hc is performed from the distance matrix between genes computed from the microarray data, i.e. the gene expression levels for various experimental conditions. different aggregation methods can be used for the construction of the dendogram generally leading to different tree topologies and a fortiori to various cluster definitions  <cit> . for instance, the single-linkage algorithm is based to the concept of joining the two closest objects  of two clusters to create a new cluster. thus the single-linkage clusters contain numerous members and are branched in high-dimensional space. the resulting clusters are affected by the chaining phenomenon . in the complete-linkage algorithm, the distance between clusters is defined as the distance between the most distant pair of objects . this method gives compact clusters. the average-linkage algorithm is based on the mean similarity of the observations to all the members of the cluster. yeung and co-workers  <cit>  showed that single-linkage hierarchical clustering is inappropriate to analyze microarray data. gibbons and roth  <cit>  showed by using gene ontology that single-and average-linkage algorithms produce worse results than random. in addition these authors conclude that the complete-linkage method is the only appropriate hc method to analyze microarrays experiments.

the microarrays experiments frequently contain some missing values. the missing values are part of the experimental errors due to the spotting conditions  and hybridization   <cit> . the users commonly discard suspicious dots during the images analysis step. thus, the resulting data matrix contains missing values  which may disturb the gene clustering obtained by the classical clustering methods, e.g. hc, som, or projection methods, e.g. pca. to limit the effects of mvs in the clustering analyses, different strategies have been proposed:  the genes containing mvs are removed,  the mvs are replaced by a constant , or  the mvs are re-estimated on the basis of the whole gene expression data. few estimation techniques have been applied to such data. the k-nearest neighbors approach  computes the estimated value from the k closest expression profiles among the dataset. troyanskaya and co-workers showed that the weighted knn approach, with k =  <dig>  is the most accurate method to estimate mvs in microarray data compared to replacement by zero, row average, or singular value decomposition  <cit> . a recent work proposes bayesian principal component analysis to deal with mvs  <cit> . in the same way, zhou and co-workers  <cit>  have used a bayesian gene selection to estimate the mvs with linear and non-linear regression. however, the knn approach is the most popular approach for estimating the mvs.

to explore the incidence of mvs in gene clustering, we first assessed the proportion of mvs in different sets of public data from saccharomyces cerevisiae and human. observing that mvs are widely present in the expression data, we then analyzed the effects of mvs on the results of a hierarchical clustering  according to the chosen clustering algorithm. in the same way, we evaluated the impact of mvs replacement and estimation in the gene cluster definition by using a hierarchical clustering method.

RESULTS
missing values overview
main steps of the analysis
moreover, two other experiments were  designed and  evaluated: clustering with mvs estimated by the knn approach, and clustering with mvs replaced by zero.

experimental sets
as we work on the impact of mvs in gene clustering, we need at first biological datasets without mvs. these sets have been extracted from ogawa set  <cit>   and gasch set  <cit>  . os and gs have been chosen because they contain few mvs and, after filtering the number of genes remains important, . the original ogawa set contained  <dig> genes with  <dig> genes having mvs. the elimination of the genes with mvs  leads to a set with  <dig> genes. for the gs, the number of mvs is more important and some experimental conditions have more than 50% of mvs. so we have limited the final number of selected experimental conditions from  <dig> to  <dig> , it allows to conserve  <dig> genes, i.e. only  <dig> genes are not analyzed, representing  <dig> % of all the genes.

moreover, we have defined two smaller sets, gsh2o <dig> and gsheat, from gs corresponding respectively to h2o <dig> and heat shock experimental conditions.

to assess the influence of size of the datasets and the number of observations , we have generated smaller sets corresponding to a ratio 1/n  of the initial os, gs, gsh2o <dig> and gsheat gene content .

example of clustering disturbance caused by missing values introduction
number of clusters
to perform the comparison of the gene clustering by hc, the numbers of clusters according to every type of hierarchical clustering algorithms have to be defined. hence we defined the number of clusters,kalgo, for each clustering algorithm . the rule consists in determining kalgo clusters as the  <dig> most important clusters correspond to 80% of the genes of the dataset . the results for os are shown in table  <dig>  for each clustering methods. as expected, we observe a correlation with the type of algorithm used. the number of clusters is lower for the well-balanced tree generally obtained by the ward and complete-linkage methods, e.g.  <dig> and  <dig> clusters respectively, compared to those providing by the other methods. for instance, the single-and centroid-linkage methods lead to the definition of  <dig> clusters.

index "conserved pairs proportion "
the clusters defined from the reference data and the data with mvs are compared using conserved pairs proportion  index which corresponds to the percentage of genes found associated in the reference clusters and found again associated in the clusters generated from the data with mvs. figure  <dig> summarizes the results about the influence of mvs on the hierarchical clustering. the given results were computed on the  subset from os using the seven aggregative algorithms. the metric used is the euclidean distance. we observe that  the single-and the centroid-linkage methods show a low cpp decrease, the cpp values are always greater than 95%,  the average-and median-linkage methods are within the range  and  the mcquitty, ward and complete-linkage methods show the most striking loss. we observe a drastic loss of the clustering stability since τ = 1% of mvs. for instance, with 5% of genes with mvs, i.e.  <dig> missing data, the mcquitty, ward and complete-linkage methods have a cpp of 62%, 57% and 52%, respectively. beyond a rate of τ equal to 10%, the decrease becomes lower.

similar results are observed for all the sets os, gs, gsh2o <dig> and gsheat and all the generated sets from 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig>  these last results show that the quality of the gene clustering is not disturbed by the reduction of the number of genes.

it must be clearly noted that to limit the effect of the topology of each algorithm, we have fixed that the  <dig> most populated clusters must represent 80% of the genes. the number of the most populated clusters is fixed at  <dig> due to the ward linkage method that gives a very limited number of clusters. then, the percentage of genes belonging to the  <dig> most populated clusters have been tested ranging from 70% to 90% . for example with a percentage equal to 90%, the cpp values of single-and the centroid-linkage methods remain too stable to observe a clear decrease as seen in figure  <dig>  the choice of 80% allows to analyze the precise decrease of the different cpp values and to compare the different aggregation methods.

k-nearest neighbor 
the knn method has been described by troyanskaya and co-workers  <cit>  for the mvs in microarray data. the knn approach goal is to compute the expected value of a missing value from the k nearest vectors without a missing value. as no theoretical approach exists to define the optimal k values , we have assessed every value of k within the range  <dig> to  <dig> and, selected the kopt value as the k value which has the minimal error rate. table  <dig> shows the kopt values obtained for the four sets used in this study and their corresponding error rates. the kopt values are lower in os subsets showing a low number of genes. the kopt values of gsh2o <dig> are within the range  <dig> to  <dig>  the gs and gsheat sets exhibit more important variations within the range  <dig> to  <dig>  the error rate decreases slightly according to the number of genes, but these variations are not significant. nevertheless, this poor correlation may be due to the subsets composition. indeed, they keep an equivalent number of clusters with a smaller number of genes per cluster. in the same way, it may simply be due to the kopt variation.

improvements of cpp with knn approach and zero-value replacements
the cpp was computed for the seven agglomeration methods. we have compared the hc results obtained with the reference sets and the generated sets without replacement of mvs, with knn replacement or with zero-value replacement methods. table 2a shows that the knn and zero-value replacements both improved the mean cpp whatever the clustering method used, except for the ward method with the zero value replacement. the knn approach is the most relevant method to replace mvs. in  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the simulations, knn is better and globally gives a mean increase of the cpp within the range . the centroid-and single-linkage methods have better increase in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the simulations respectively due to their particular topologies. the zero value replacement is clearly less efficient.

nevertheless, as a slight variation can displace one gene into a close cluster, we have characterized another index named cppf to consider the f closest clusters of the selected cluster. this index is similar to the previous one and takes into account that the genes may be relocated in close clusters . it allows the evaluation of the topology conservation. we used f =  <dig>  we observed that the co-associated genes in the reference sets are often displaced to close clusters in the simulated sets. as observed for the cpp, the knn approach improves the cppf for all the clustering methods in  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the simulations within the range . due to their high initial cpp values , single-and centroid-linkage methods do not have a gain as previously observed for the cpp.

similar results are obtained with the other sets with slight variations. for example, gsh2o <dig> have cpp and cppf close to the one of os. conversely, the cpp and cppf of gsheat are better than the ones of os and gsh2o <dig> for the complete-linkage and ward methods, but lower for the others. the gs set has higher cpp and cppf for single-likage to mcquitty method due to a lower influence of the mvs in a vector with a higher number of experimental conditions. nevertheless, the complete-linkage and ward linkage still remain at a very low cpp .

moreover, we have tested the influence of the number of mvs per gene by introducing more than one missing value per gene. we obtained similar results showing less than  <dig> % of variations of the cpp values. in addition we have tested the consequences of using k values different of kopt values in the range  and we observed a decrease of cpp within the range  .

extreme values
we have followed the same methodology to analyze the extreme values, i.e. values superior to  <dig>  and lower than - <dig> . table 2b summarizes the results of the os . the cpp values are superior to the cpp values obtained previously, because only the genes with important variations have mvs and are members of small clusters. we observe that mvs replacement has little effect. indeed, the knn and zero – value replacement cannot restore a correct distribution . however, the cppf shows that the knn is better than the replacement by zero, allowing a better topology preservation. same results are observed for the other sets .

CONCLUSIONS
mvs are a common trait of microarrays experiments. few works had been reported about mvs replacements  <cit>  and none analyse their influence in the clustering of microarrays data. in our study, we showed that mvs significantly biased the hierarchical clustering. in addition, we observed that the effects of mvs are correlated to the chosen clustering method. the single linkage-method is the most stable due to the building of cluster of large size and numerous small clusters and singletons. at the opposite, the ward and complete-linkage methods create well distributed population of clusters inducing a higher sensitivity to mvs. the topology of the dendogram is highly disturbed by transferring genes in distant clusters.

we showed that the knn replacement method was the most efficient approach to compensate the mvs effects compared to the classical replacement by zero. the kopt depends on the sample size. it is important to keep in mind that the mvs corresponding to extreme values are difficult to estimate with the knn method. the impact of their approximation upon the clustering is significant. hence, new approaches like the bayesian principal component analysis  may overcome this problem. in a recent work liu and co-workers suggest to potentially eliminate the incomplete series of data by using robust singular values decomposition  <cit> . in addition, our work showed clearly the need of evaluation of the data quality and statistical measurements as noted by tilstone  <cit> .

contrary to yeung and co-workers  <cit>  and gibbons and roth  <cit> , we have defined for each type of hierarchical clustering algorithm  a specific number of clusters . this point is one of the main difficulties noted by yeung and co-workers  <cit>  to evaluate the clustering methods as the topology generated are different. the comparison of the different aggregative clustering algorithms remains constrained by the topology . all these results are in accordance with the results of nikkilä and co-workers  <cit>  which show a hieratic problem of topology preservation in hierarchical clustering. recent methods like sota  <cit>  or growing som   <cit>  have combined a hierarchical clustering visualization with the preservation of the topology allowed by the som. our future works will address the definition of a most robust clustering method.
