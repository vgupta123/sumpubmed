BACKGROUND
the pig  is one of the most widespread livestock species and one of the most economically important worldwide. the porcine genome has a total of  <dig> autosomes plus the x/y sex chromosome pair; it is similar in size, complexity and chromosomal organization to the human genome. in contrast to snps and microsatellites, structural variations have received considerably less attention in pigs. copy number variants  are dna segments ranging in length from kilobases to several megabases with a variable number of repeats among individuals  <cit> . segmental duplications and cnvs have been extensively studied in other organisms  <cit> . previous studies at genome scale suggest that cnvs comprise 5-12% of the human and ~4% of the dog genome  <cit> . cnvs can influence gene expression, affect several metabolic traits and have been associated with mendelian and complex genetic disorders  <cit> .

recent studies in pigs have detected cnvs using the comparative genomic hybridization  technique in arrays designed to cover specific porcine chromosomes  <cit> . an alternative, cheaper method for cnv detection is based on whole genome snp genotyping chips  <cit> , but it has not been tested yet, to our knowledge, in the swine species. a high-density porcine snp beadchip has recently been released by illumina, which contains probes to genotype  <dig>  snps covering the whole genome. this platform has an average distance between snps of  <dig>  kb in autosomes and  <dig>  kb in chromosome x  and is a very valuable resource to study pig genetic variability and the molecular dissection of complex traits of economic importance  <cit> .

the goal of this study was to detect cnv regions  from the porcine snp <dig> beadchip data on autosomal chromosomes using a pedigree from an iberian x landrace  cross and to validate them in a collection of unrelated pigs from different origins.

RESULTS
detection of structural variants
the porcine snp <dig> beadchip data from  <dig> ibmap animals were analyzed by multiple predictions from three different programs: cnvpartition , penncnv  <cit>  and gada  <cit> . the initial number of cnvs called by each software was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> summarizes the cnvs identified and compares the results obtained from the three programs.

for further analyses, we retained only cnvs applying a more stringent criterion, namely cnv regions  containing overlapping cnvs recalled by at least two programs, spanning three or more consecutive snps and detected in a minimum of two animals. a total of  <dig> cnvrs located in  <dig> of the  <dig> analyzed autosomal chromosomes were identified . all of these cnvrs showed mendelian inheritance in animals across several generations of the ibmap cross and therefore are unlikely to be artefacts or false positives, suggesting that our empirical criterion to retain cnvrs is reasonable.

the percentage of cnvrs confirmed by at least two programs was  <dig> % for penncnv, 21% for gada and  <dig> % for cnvpartition. a total of  <dig> cnvrs  were detected by the three algorithms . similar results were reported by winchester et al.  comparing different algorithms for cnv detection, suggesting that penncnv is the most accurate program in the prediction of cnvs for the illumina's platform  <cit> . in a recent study  <cit> , the relative performance of seven methods for cnv identification was evaluated showing that the penncnv algorithm has a moderate power and the lowest false positive rate. this is likely explained by the unique ability of this algorithm to integrate family relationships and signal intensities from parent-offspring trios data. the low percentage of cnvs called by the gada software might be explained by the relative low coverage of the porcine snp <dig> beadchip.

the size of the cnvrs detected ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb, with a median size of  <dig>  kb . the porcine snp <dig> beadchip was originally developed for high-throughput snp genotyping in association studies. although cnv detection is feasible with this technology, it is impaired by low marker density, non-uniform distribution of snps along pig chromosomes and lack of non-polymorphic probes specifically designed for cnv identification  <cit> . hence, only the largest cnvrs are expected to be assessed with the porcine snp <dig> beadchip. this explains the difference in minimum cnv length between our study  and the work of fadista et al.,  <dig>  using the cgh technique.

the genomic coordinates are expressed in bp and are relative to the sus scrofa april  <dig> genome sequence assembly 

among the first  <dig> animals analyzed, a single cnvr  was called in two animals whereas the remaining  <dig> cnvrs were called in three or more animals. a segregation analysis was performed in  <dig> additional animals from the ibmap cross and the distribution of the cnvrs was additionally studied in  <dig> unrelated pig samples from different geographical origins . all initially detected  <dig> cnvrs were segregating in the ibmap cross and  <dig> were also detected in american pig populations . the number of animals with alternative alleles for the cnvrs ranged from five  to  <dig> . the predicted status for the cnvrs was  <dig>  for gain, eight  for loss and  <dig>  for regions with gain or loss status in different animals . this proportion may be related to natural selection, as it is assumed that the genome is more tolerant to duplications than to deletions  <cit> . the high percentage of cnvrs with gain or loss status may be the result of including in the analysis pig breeds with different genetic origins and from different countries. however, to establish the real status of cnvrs, validation by other techniques such as quantitative pcr  will be necessary.

genes located within cnvrs
the biomart software in the ensembl sscrofa <dig> database was used to retrieve genes annotated within the genomic regions of cnvrs. a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes, four mirna, six miscrna, three pseudogenes, two rrna, two snorna and nine snrna were annotated within the  <dig> cnvrs . two or more annotated genes were found in  <dig> cnvrs, whereas one gene only was located in  <dig> cnvrs. no annotated genes were identified in  <dig> cnvrs, but this can be due to the incomplete annotation of the sscrofa <dig> genome sequence assembly. in contrast to the high number of genes found in this study, it has been suggested that cnvs are located preferably in gene-poor regions  <cit> , probably because cnvs present in gene-rich regions may be deleterious and therefore removed by purifying selection  <cit> .

validation by quantitative pcr
real time quantitative assays were designed for cnvr validation on seven genomic regions simultaneously detected with the three programs . five of these cnvrs  were confirmed by qpcr, nevertheless fewer animals were validated for cnvrs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . thus, the false discovery rate  for the seven analyzed cnvrs was 29%; it should be noted that the percentage of cnvrs validated in this study  is higher than previously reported in pigs   <cit> . this result might be explained by the stringent criteria used in our analysis, which was proposed in order to increase confidence and minimize the false positives. nevertheless, we were not able to confirm two of the cnvrs..several factors may account for the discrepancy in cnvr prediction between the in silico analysis of porcine snp <dig> beadchip data and the qpcr method. first, the incomplete status of the 4Ã— sequence depth sscrofa <dig> assembly and the low probe density of the porcine snp <dig> beadchip makes it difficult to establish the true boundaries of cnvrs and may result in an over estimation of their real size. therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the primers used to validate the cnvrs by qpcr may have been designed outside the structural polymorphic region. second, polymorphisms such as snps and indels may influence the hybridization of the qpcr primers, changing the relative quantification  values for some animals. finally, the true cnvr boundaries may be also polymorphic between the analyzed animals.

for the qpcr validation of cnvr <dig>  a pcr protocol for the cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> fragment gene  was designed. a total of  <dig> animals were analyzed:  <dig> with statistical evidence for cnvr and  <dig> without the cnvr . one of the animals from the control group was selected as reference. six false positive animals were observed, indicating a fdr of 29% for cnvr <dig> .

a qpcr assay with primers located in the slc16a <dig> gene  was used for cnvr <dig> validation. a total of  <dig> animals were analyzed:  <dig> with statistical evidence for cnvr  and  <dig> without the cnvr . one of the animals from the control group was selected as reference. nine of the ibmap cross animals were validated by qpcr . conversely, only three animals from the american populations were validated by qpcr, suggesting a higher fdr  . these differences in fdr may be explained by the higher accuracy of the penncnv algorithm when family information is available and stress the usefulness of including family information in cnv detection. however, this conclusion should be taken with caution due to the limited number of animals analyzed.

for cnvrs  <dig> and  <dig>  copy number changes were also identified by qpcr in animals where cnvs were not detected initially in the statistical analysis . this represents a false negative rate of 10%  for cnvr <dig> and 50%  for cnvr <dig>  the three false negative animals for cnvr <dig> were classified as deletions by qpcr protocol. a similar situation, but with a different copy number status, was observed for cnvr <dig>  where the eight false negative animals showed a duplication pattern by qpcr. false negative identification is common in cnv detection, and has been reported previously using the cgh technique in pigs and other mammalian species  <cit> .

three of the validated cnvrs  showed differential patterns of copy number variants between breeds. for instance, cnvr <dig> showed a loss  in landrace and in animals from other breeds . assuming that iberian pigs have two copies of cnvr <dig> , five animals showing an rq =  <dig> by qpcr are predicted to be homozygous for a deletion on this genomic region. in cnvr <dig>  a loss was found in iberian pigs relative to landrace animals . in agreement with the mendelian segregation of this cnvr, hybrid animals show intermediate rq values. the rq mean values were  <dig>  for iberian,  <dig>  for landrace and  <dig>  for hybrid animals.

cnvr <dig> contains a mirna gene  and the cytochrome p <dig> c <dig> fragment gene , which is a member of the cytochrome p <dig> gene family . proteins coded by this gene family constitute the major catalytic component of the liver mixed-function oxidase system and play a pivotal role in the metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous compounds  <cit> . interestingly, cnvs comprising genes of the cytp45o family have been described in humans and dogs  <cit> , but had not been previously reported in pigs. in humans, copy number variations of cytp45o genes have been associated with variation in drug metabolism phenotypes  <cit> . differential expression of genes of the cytp <dig> family has been correlated with androsterone levels in pigs from duroc and landrace breeds  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that the total cytp <dig> activity was slightly higher in minipigs compared to conventional pigs  <cit> . cnvr <dig> lays close to the peak position of a qtl for androsterone leves described in a cross between large white and chinese meishan  <cit> . this suggests a possible role of this structural variation in determining androsterone levels; however, more studies will be necessary to validate this hypothesis.

cnvr <dig>  also validated by qpcr, comprises the slc16a <dig> gene. this gene belongs to the solute carrier family  <dig> gene family, which encodes  <dig> proteins that are largely known as monocarboxylate transporters . the human slc16a <dig> gene encodes the mct <dig> protein  <cit>  and it is expressed in several normal human tissues. in pigs, mct <dig> may function as a housekeeping lactate transporter, regulating the acidification of glycolytic muscles  <cit> . remarkably, cnvr <dig> is located in the middle of the confidence interval of a qtl for meat ph described in four pig populations  <cit> .

duplication events have also been validated by qpcr for sox <dig>   and insc  . copy number changes have not been previously reported in either of them in pigs. sox <dig> is a member of the sox gene family  <cit>  of transcription factors involved in the regulation of embryo development and cell fate determination. sox <dig> may have a major role in the regulation of nervous system development and it is a mediator of the neuronal death process  <cit> . sox <dig> is an intronless gene that may has arisen by duplication from an ancestral sox b gene, which likely was the product of a retrotransposition event  <cit> . inscuteable  was first described in drosophila and it plays a central role in the molecular machinery for mitotic spindle orientation and regulates cell polarity for asymmetric division  <cit> . inscuteable homologs have been found in several species, including vertebrates and insects  <cit> . in mammals, insc is functionally conserved and it is required for correct orientation of the mitotic spindle in retina  <cit>  and skin  <cit>  precursor cells.

the qpcr assay for cnvr <dig> validation was designed over the sequence of one expressed sequence tag . from four cuban creole pigs tested, three animals showed a deletion and one animal a duplication event .

other relevant cnvrs
although other cnvrs have not been analyzed by qpcr, there is evidence of structural polymorphism in the literature. for instance, cnvr <dig> contains the kit gene, a well-characterized and functionally important cnv in pigs. the dominant white coat phenotype in pigs is caused by kit gene duplication or triplication and a splice mutation in one of the kit gene copies  <cit> . in addition, studies in other mammals  <cit>  have described cnvrs overlapping other gene families including: olfactory receptor family, glutamate receptor family, solute carrier family, cytochrome p <dig> family, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases family and fucosyltransferase family. twelve of the cnvrs detected in our study include or overlap porcine orthologues of these genes. furthermore,  <dig> of the detected cnvrs include  <dig> genes previously reported in the human database of genomic variants http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/?source=hg <dig> <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the first cnvrs in swine based on whole genome snp genotyping chips. a total of  <dig> cnvrs were identified in  <dig> autosomal chromosomes. these cnvrs showed mendelian inheritance across  <dig> individuals belonging to several generations of an iberian x landrace cross, and were also confirmed in different pig breeds. five out of seven selected cnvrs were validated by qpcr; among the remaining cnvrs we found well known examples of cnvs conserved across mammalian species. although these results illustrate the usefulness of porcine snp <dig> beadchip to detect cnvrs, the number detected here is probably a gross underestimate given the wide interval between snps in the porcine  <dig> k beadchip.
