BACKGROUND
meningiomas are the most frequently occurring intracranial tumors. clinically treated meningiomas comprise approximately 13–26% of all primary brain tumors  <cit> . epidemiological studies indicate that ~90% of all meningiomas are asymptomatic  <cit> . the majority are benign, slowly growing, solitary and sporadic tumors, but atypical or malignant meningioma constitutes approximately 10% of all cases. meningiomas are thought to be derived from the arachnoid cap cells of the leptomeninges, which is the covering of the brain and the spinal cord  <cit> . they usually occur in the cranial meninges, but approximately 10% of tumors develop in the meninges covering the spine. from histopathological and clinical points of view, meningiomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors, which are classified into  <dig> histopathological types with who malignancy grades i–iii  <cit> .

meningiomas was the first solid tumor to be characterized as containing a specific genetic aberration, which is monosomy  <dig>  <cit> . since then, loss of genetic material from chromosome  <dig> has been the most consistent aberration, observed in up to 70% of tumors  <cit> . meningiomas are closely associated with the genetic syndrome neurofibromatosis type- <dig> . approximately 50% of nf <dig> patients suffer from meningiomas, making them the second most frequent neoplasm associated with this tumor syndrome  <cit> . in  <dig>  the neurofibromatosis type  <dig>  tumor suppressor gene was characterized from chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . sporadic meningiomas were therefore screened for mutations in the nf <dig> gene, which was found to be frequently inactivated. there is, however, a wide discrepancy in the reported mutation frequency   <cit> . in fact, it has been shown that meningiomas may be grouped into tumors with and without mutations in the nf <dig> gene. these groups can also be correlated with histopathological subtypes  <cit> . tumors with mutations in the nf <dig> gene are often of the transitional or fibrous subtype, commonly with allelic losses on chromosome  <dig>  tumors without nf <dig> gene mutations are predominantly of the meningothelial subtype, and allelic losses on chromosome  <dig> are less commonly observed in this subtype. furthermore, the meningothelial meningiomas are more often located in the anterior parts of the skull base  <cit> . transcriptional silencing of the nf <dig> tumor suppressor by cpg methylation in meningiomas was recently tested by two research groups, but the results were conflicting. van tilborg et al. reported methylation in  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors, whereas lomas and colleagues reported a higher methylation frequency   <cit> .

despite almost  <dig> years of cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, the nf <dig> tumor suppressor is still the only specific gene which has been shown to be frequently involved early in the development of meningiomas. there is, however, a general consensus that other not yet characterized loci are important for the development and/or progression of these tumors  <cit> . considering the clinical and histopathological heterogeneity of meningiomas, it is possible that alternative genetic mechanisms underlay its tumorigenesis. there are reports of the loss of chromosome  <dig> as the primary consistent aberration in meningiomas, in the absence of mutations in the nf <dig> gene. moreover, young patients with constitutional ring chromosomes and multifocal meningiomas have been characterized. this highlights the possibility of an alternative genetic etiology related to other genes located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, other sites in the genome have been implicated in meningioma development or progression  <cit> . among these, aberrations of chromosome  <dig> have been established as the second major genetic factor for the initiation/progression of meningiomas and correlate with increased morbidity  <cit> . furthermore, the nf <dig> gene has also been excluded by linkage analysis in one family with multiple meningothelial meningiomas and ependymomas  <cit> . these various reports suggest that there exist additional loci contributing to the formation of meningiomas.

the rationale of this study was to perform a multilevel analysis of mutations that include gene dosage aberrations on chromosome  <dig>  analysis of point mutations in the nf <dig> locus, and profiling of the methylation status within the nf <dig> gene promoter. we also intended to relate our findings from chromosome  <dig> to the high resolution dna copy number variation in meningiomas of chromosome  <dig>  which was recently reported  <cit> .

RESULTS
we analyzed a comprehensive series of sporadic meningiomas on multiple levels, i.e. for presence of "macro-mutations" involving large scale aberrations of 22q using an array-based approach and for "micro-mutations" within the nf <dig> tumor suppressor gene. the latter involved analysis of point mutations within the mrna encoding part of this gene and within the conserved non-genic  sequences, which we have previously defined  <cit> . we also comprehensively studied the promoter region of the nf <dig> gene for cpg methylation.

chromosome  <dig> dna copy number profiling using array-cgh
we studied  <dig> sporadic meningioma samples, composing a representative series of tumors operated on at a single hospital in sweden. all tumor samples studied were analyzed previously using a lower resolution approach  <cit> . the main rationale in this part of the project was to identify tumors possessing gene dosage aberrations of 22q which did not involve the nf <dig> locus. we carried out dna copy number profiling using array-cgh on a genomic microarray covering chromosome  <dig>  this array, containing  <dig> measurement points across the sequenced part of this autosome, was developed and validated previously  <cit> . among the samples used for validation of this array was meningioma t <dig> dna, which is a well characterized tumor containing a large terminal deletion of 22q and an additional approximately  <dig> kb biallelic deletion involving ewsr <dig>  gar <dig>  rrp <dig>  ap1b <dig>  rfpl <dig> and nefh genes  <cit> . on average, each array-cgh experiment generated ~ <dig> positively scored data points from 22q.

all samples displaying aberrations other than monosomy  <dig> are graphically summarized in fig 1a. this analysis enables the discrimination of several minimal overlapping deleted regions which should be studied further. two of these regions, named as r <dig>  and r <dig>  are small enough to allow for detailed analysis of a limited number of candidate genes . the breakpoint cluster region  gene is one interesting candidate located in r <dig>  this gene is located at the site of the chromosome  <dig> breakpoint generating the philadelphia chromosome  translocation that creates the bcr/abl fusion gene found in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. the normal bcr gene was reported to have a serine/threonine kinase activity  <cit> . another candidate gene located within r <dig> is the rgr oncogene. this gene was originally identified as a fusion protein which can promote tumor development in nude mice, but has also displayed oncogenic properties when not in the fusion form  <cit> . the rgr gene has frequently been found to be altered in human t-cell malignancies  <cit> . the zinc finger protein encoding gene zcwcc <dig>  located within r <dig>  may also be a candidate for further investigation. the relative weakness of the r <dig> and r <dig> regions is that they are defined by rare cases with small deletions. there is therefore a possibility that the latter chromosome  <dig> aberrations are neutral "passenger mutations", with little consequence to tumorigenesis. yet another apparent, large candidate region is located towards the telomere of 22q, starting from clone id  <dig>  this segment is affected by hemizygous deletion in all but one  of the studied tumors which disclosed gene copy number imbalances of chromosome  <dig> 

the third major category of tumors  was composed of samples that did not display detectable changes in gene dosage on 22q  despite the high average resolution . there may be several possible explanations for these results. one possibility is that additional genes on 22q  are important for meningioma development and these are mutated by alternative mechanisms, such as point mutation or epigenetic silencing. another explanation might be that this subset of samples involves an alternative tumorigenic pthway which does not involve chromosome 22-located genes.

the current version of the chromosome  <dig> array has been supplemented with additional non- 22q-derived genomic clones from other chromosomes, which encompass genes  of potential interest in the fields of meningiomas and brain tumors in general. the complete list of these additional clones is provided in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the samples in which loss of dna copy number was detected for some of these loci. the highest rate of loss detected was at the ptch2a locus on 1p <dig> , which displayed a rate of loss of 18%. the other loci, namely dal- <dig>  ptch1b, sufu1a and sufu1b, displayed a level of dna copy number loss of 6%, 5%, 6% and 6%, respectively. we also detected dna copy number losses in a number of non-chromosome 22-derived control clones. the most frequently deleted control clones were those derived from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting the likely importance of other regions of the genome in meningioma development/progression.

mutation analysis of nf <dig> exons and evolutionarily conserved non-genic sequences 
inactivating micro-mutations in the nf <dig> tumor suppressor gene are found in meningiomas of all histopathological subtypes and malignancy grades and are thought to be an early event in tumorigenesis  <cit> . however, large differences  of mutation frequency in sporadic meningiomas were previously reported  <cit> . our rationale was to reassess the mutation frequency of nf <dig>  especially when combined with very high resolution array-cgh analysis of these tumors. the rationale was also to test the hypothesis that mutations might be located in evolutionarily well conserved non-genic sequences within introns or in the 5' promoter region of the nf <dig> gene, in addition to mutations in the exons. comparisons of the orthologous genomic sequence from the nf <dig> locus derived from five species  were previously performed in order to identify cngs that might be of functional importance for the nf <dig> gene  <cit> . the exonic sequence of the nf <dig> gene constitutes ~ <dig> % of this locus. when applying a threshold of 70% sequence identity over > <dig> bp of gap-free alignment in comparisons between human and mouse, the resulting level of extra-exonic conservation was  <dig> %. we selected cngs for mutational analysis that displayed a similar level of evolutionarily conservation as the protein coding sequence. in total,  <dig>  kb was sequenced in  <dig> tumors, which included all  <dig> exons, the highly conserved exon flanking sequences and seven cngs not contiguous with exons . four of the cngs were positioned upstream of exon  <dig> and the remaining three cngs were located in introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

thirty-nine alterations were identified in  <dig> analyzed samples . fifteen mutations caused frame-shifts, twelve altered the acceptor- or donor-splice sites, nine were nonsense, two were missense and one mutation occurred in the inter <dig> cng. none of the identified mutations were present in the corresponding peripheral blood dna. thirty-five of these mutations were accompanied by a macro-mutation on the other allele, either through monosomy or terminal/interstitial deletions. overall, we could detect mutations consistent with biallelic inactivation of the nf <dig> tumor suppressor gene in 36% of meningiomas . however, in three cases  no second inactivating mutation could be identified. considering what is known to date about the nf <dig> gene mutational spectrum in different tumors, it can be assumed that at least two of the latter three mutations  are pathogenic. these types of mutations are, however, usually combined with the second inactivating hit on the remaining normal allele of the gene  <cit> . the third aberration is a missense mutation , which is possibly introducing a dysfunction to the n-terminal ferm domain  of the protein. merlin/schwannomin provides a link between the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through binding sites in its ferm domain  <cit> . thus, there exists a possibility of this missense mutation exerting a sufficiently strong dominant negative effect on the protein function, which does not necessitate the presence of the second hit nf <dig> gene inactivating event in this tumor. the three tumors discussed above  allow us to estimate our false negative detection rate of mutations in the nf <dig> gene. we can speculate that, in at least two and a maximum of three of the studied tumors, we could expect the second hit nf <dig> gene mutation to be present, but we were unable to detect it. assuming the above reasoning to be correct, our false negative rate of micro-mutation detection is between  <dig>  –  <dig> %.

in case m <dig> we identified two tumor-specific micro-mutations, one mutation causing a frame shift in exon  <dig> introducing a premature stop codon and the second being a mutation in the inter <dig> cng element. inter <dig> is situated approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the nf <dig> gene . it displays sequence conservation between human and pufferfish, which are evolutionarily very distant species  <cit> , suggesting that inter <dig> may possess functional properties. details on the exact position of the inter <dig> mutation on chromosome the  <dig> sequence are shown in table  <dig>  the tumor-specific mutation in inter <dig> cng is one of three changes present in m <dig>  as this tumor also contains monosomy  <dig>  thus, we may speculate that three hits are affecting the nf <dig> gene. an alternative explanation is that one of these mutations has little consequence to the normal function of the nf <dig> gene.

methylation profiling of the nf <dig> promoter region by bisulfite modification followed by pyrosequencing
methylation of promoter associated cpg-islands is known as a possible mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in a variety of human cancers. it has also been suggested as a mechanism of repressing transcription of the nf <dig> gene in schwannomas  <cit>  and in meningiomas  <cit> . methylation of other cancer related genes  has also been reported to be associated with malignant progression of meningiomas  <cit> . we used an established method of bisulfite treatment of tumor dna followed by pyrosequencing  which allows detection and semi-quantitative estimation of the degree of methylation at the selected cpgs  <cit> . two overlapping pcr products of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp covered ~ <dig> bp of the upstream promoter region, the first exon and approximately  <dig> bp of intron  <dig>  immediately downstream of the first exon . these two products were pyrosequenced with  <dig> sequencing primers. in total,  <dig> cpg sites were sequenced, between positions - <dig> and + <dig> bp . this analysis allowed interrogation of up to  <dig> cpg sites per assay, distributed over  <dig> bp and with a maximum of  <dig> dispensations of nucleotides . methylation was identified in only one tumor sample , at a single cpg site at position + <dig>  in ~40% of dna molecules in this tumor . kino et al. reported a  <dig> bp region  essential for nf <dig> expression in schwannomas  <cit> . three cpg sites within this region  appeared to be of particular importance for silencing of the nf <dig> gene upon methylation in schwannomas. we paid particular attention to these cpg sites but no methylation was detected. in summary, upon comprehensive analysis of  <dig> cpg sites, we conclude that methylation does not play a major role in the silencing of the nf <dig> gene in meningiomas. these results are in accordance with a report by van tilborg et al  <cit>  although contradicting the results from lomas et al.  <cit> .

summary of macro- and micro-mutations on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in meningiomas
we observed pronounced differences of the nf <dig> gene mutation frequency between different histopathological subtypes of meningiomas . there was a clear trend towards an increased frequency of the biallelic nf <dig> gene inactivation in meningothelial, transitional and fibroblastic subtypes which were  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors ,  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors  and  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors , respectively. based on these results, we may speculate that the biallelic inactivation of the nf <dig> gene is not as important for the development of the meningothelial subtype of meningioma, when compared to the transitional and fibroblastic tumors. a related trend was even more pronounced, when the frequencies of large chromosome  <dig> deletions were correlated to the three above mentioned histopathological subtypes of meningioma. the presence of large hemizygous deletions showed marked differences between the meningothelial, transitional and fibroblastic subtypes, comprising  <dig> out of  <dig> cases ,  <dig> out of  <dig> cases  and  <dig> out of  <dig> cases , respectively. it should be stressed here that  <dig> out of  <dig> fibroblastic meningiomas, which displayed gene dosage imbalances on 22q, were monosomy  <dig> cases. the three remaining tumors  all showed a minimum loss of  <dig> mb of 22q. it may thus be hypothesized that one copy loss of genes located within the  <dig> mb on 22q is important for generation of the fibroblastic phenotype of cells.

more than half  of the meningothelial cases were among the category of tumors with both chromosome  <dig> copies retained. one possible explanation for this finding is that meningothelial tumors more frequently harbor mutations in additional genes that are located outside chromosome  <dig>  our results correlate well with previous studies by wellenreuther et al.  <cit>  as well as with evans and colleagues  <cit>  that identified nf <dig> gene mutations in 4/ <dig>  and 1/ <dig>  of meningothelial tumors. the above results from dna level analysis are supported by analysis of merlin/schwannomin protein expression, which show normal expression in the greater part of meningothelial tumors, but severely reduced expression levels in the majority of fibrous and transitional meningiomas  <cit> . furthermore, correlation between tumor localization and histological subtype was previously reported. the majority of meningiomas with no chromosome  <dig> aberrations were localized in the anterior skull base and were predominantly meningothelial  <cit> . taken together, these results might suggest that cellular origin plays a role in the genetic pathways which are operative during tumor formation of meningiomas. in the context of our results from chromosome  <dig>  it is interesting to correlate this to the data obtained from chromosome  <dig>  as genetic aberrations affecting these two autosomes are the most frequent genetic abnormalities in meningiomas  <cit> . furthermore, aberrations of chromosome  <dig> are also related to recurrence-free survival from the disease  <cit> . we have recently completed a high resolution analysis of chromosome  <dig> using the same tumor series  <cit>  and  <dig> of the samples were studied with similar resolution on both chromosomes . there is a strong relationship between changes on both chromosomes, with 67% of samples showing concurrent aberrations. these results clearly indicate the need for a genome-wide and high-resolution array-based characterization of chromosomal aberrations in meningiomas.

CONCLUSIONS
one objective of this study was to identify the maximum number of tumors displaying copy number aberrations of 22q not encompassing the nf <dig> locus. from the category of tumors displaying terminal- and interstitial-deletions we identified at least two minimal overlapping candidate regions outside the nf <dig> locus. these regions allow analysis of a limited number of candidate genes. interesting candidates in these regions include the bcr gene, implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia; the rgr oncogene involved in ras-signaling  <cit>  and found to be altered in human t-cell malignancies  <cit> ; and the zinc finger protein encoding gene zcwcc <dig>  one additional candidate region starts at clone id  <dig> and extends toward the telomere . this segment is hemizygously deleted in all but one  of the studied tumors with 22q gene copy number imbalances.

we assessed the point mutation frequency of nf <dig> in combination with array-cgh of 22q. the rationale was to test the hypothesis that mutations also may be located in evolutionarily well conserved non-genic sequences within introns or in the 5' promoter region, in addition to mutations in the exons. we identified  <dig> point mutations in  <dig> tumors. in one single case , there were three tumor-specific mutations detected; a point mutation in the cng inter <dig>  a nonsense mutation in exon  <dig> and monosomy  <dig>  inter <dig> displays sequence conservation between human and pufferfish, suggesting that it may possess functional properties. however, the fact that the inter <dig> mutation represented one out of three genetic alterations in this tumor, and that we only identified a single mutation in one cng, suggests that this is not a major mechanism for inactivation of the nf <dig> gene. we also analyzed the methylation status of nf <dig> promoter associated cpgs in order to examine if this mechanism is associated with repressing nf <dig> transcription in sporadic meningiomas. we identified methylation in only one tumor sample , at a single cpg site . thus, we conclude that methylation is unlikely to play a major role in silencing of the nf <dig> gene in meningioma.

profound differences in mutation frequency were observed between various histopathological subtypes of tumors. there was a considerably higher frequency of biallelic nf <dig> inactivation in fibroblastic  compared to meningothelial  tumors. the presence of 22q copy number imbalances were also more common in the fibroblastic  compared to the meningothelial  subtype. thus, inactivation of nf <dig> combined with the presence of macro-mutation on 22q, might not be as important for the development of the meningothelial subtype, as opposed to the fibroblastic form.

chromosome  <dig> genetic abnormalities are frequently observed in meningiomas  <cit> . forty-nine of the samples studied here were also previously analyzed for gene dosage aberrations on chromosome  <dig> by array-cgh  <cit> . we observed a strong correlation between changes on both chromosomes, with 67% of samples showing concurrent aberrations. a genome-wide and high-resolution copy number analysis could contribute to identify additional genetic alterations involved in tumor development, especially for the meningothelial subtype, which does not commonly display nf <dig> and 22q alterations.
