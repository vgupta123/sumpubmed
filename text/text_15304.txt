BACKGROUND
there are five canonical tastes that are sensed in the taste buds of the tongue, which include salty, sour, sweet, umami and bitter. while salty and sour are detected by ion channels, the other three are sensed by a group of g-protein coupled receptors called taste receptors . sweet and umami are appetizing tastes that characterize energy-rich food sources, namely sugar and amino acid molecules, respectively, and are sensed by the tas1r sub-type tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, the – unpleasant - bitter taste indicating the presence of toxic molecules, is sensed by tas2rs, also known as bitter taste receptors  <cit> , which include a variable list of highly polymorphic genes with many species-specific orthologs. the annotation of the pig genome contains ten tas2rs according to the ensembl database . in the recent years, it has become obvious that tasrs are expressed in many other tissues and have additional chemo-sensing functions. for example, they are present in the respiratory system where they regulate innate immunity and infection  <cit> , and in sperm they have been linked to motility and acrosomal reaction  <cit> . in the gastro-intestinal tract, tasrs detect the molecules that are on transit and stimulate the appetite and reward  circuitries to promote the appropriate feeding behaviour, thus keeping energy balance and body homeostasis  <cit> . the ar mechanisms are highly interconnected and involve complex networks containing nutrients, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, hormones and their related receptors and enzymes. these pathways engage the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, muscle, adipose tissue and brain. appetite-related genes such as leptin , leptin receptor , cholecystokinin , ghrelin , agouti-related protein , neuropeptide y , proopiomelanocortin  and melanocortin  <dig> receptor  encode for products that inhibit or excite the dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and glutamate receptor pathways  <cit>  and modulate food intake and energy balance. in a nutshell, ghrelin and lep are two hormones with opposite excitatory and inhibitory effects on the same neurons secreting appetite inducing npy and agrp or the feeding inhibitor pomc. these neuropeptides in turn, inactivate or excite mc4r, which is a hunger repressor. ghrelin is secreted by the stomach when it is empty and lep is released by adipocytes as a response to high energy stores  <cit> . cck is a hormone secreted in the duodenum as a response to luminal fat and protein and is a strong inhibitor of food intake probably by decreasing gastric emptying and stimulating the vagus nerve  <cit> . lep and ghrelin also inhibit and excite dopamine secretion, respectively  <cit> . dopamine signalling in certain parts of the brain promotes appetite. ghrelin secretion during fasting also promotes glutamate release. this neurotransmitter, via a large catalogue of receptors, will also excite npy, agrp and inhibit pomc neurons and boost appetite. the catabolic product of glutamate, gamma aminobutyric acid  also boosts appetite but using different neuronal mechanisms  <cit> . moreover, glutamate is also able to excite dopamine-secreting neurons in appetite-relevant areas of the brain thereby indirectly promoting the feeling of hunger  <cit> . in contrast, gaba can inhibit the same neurons and indirectly promote satiety  <cit> . serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is mostly present in the gastrointestinal tract but also at much lower levels in the central nervous system, modulates gastrointestinal motility, mood and appetite  <cit> . serotonin inhibits appetite by stimulating its receptors htr2c and htr1b, which in turn, activate the well-known appetite-inhibitors pomc and mc4r and inhibit the appetite-promoter genes npy and agrp. epinephrine/norepinephrine are two additional neurotransmitters that seem to be key in food intake and in keeping energy balance and have been shown to respond to starvation and low glucose levels in blood by activating the secretion of ghrelin  <cit> .

in humans, the recent advent of whole genome  <cit>  and exome  <cit>  sequencing has shown that mutations severely impacting on protein sequence are more abundant than previously thought, although due to purifying selection, they tend to have very low allele frequencies. thus, protein-damaging polymorphisms in tasrs and ar genes are likely to have an important impact on a broad range of traits including feed intake, immune function, behaviour or fertility both in livestock and humans. consequently, understanding how these variants affect phenotypes in farm animals may both help improving the sustainability of the animal breeding sector as well as benefit bio-medical research. scientific interest in this gene family in the pig is now emerging and it has recently been shown that tasrs are expressed in multiple porcine systems . the recent publication of the swine genome sequence and annotation  <cit>  and the development of genome capture assays open unprecedented possibilities to identify deleterious genetic variation. for instance,  <dig> coding variants in swine tasrs have recently been identified after analyzing the low coverage whole genome sequences of  <dig> domestic and wild pigs from europe and asia  <cit> .

motivated by their functional relevance in the pig, we have sequenced ten porcine canonical tasrs and  <dig> ar genes in  <dig> pigs from multiple breeds in  <dig> dna pools with the aim to identify coding polymorphisms and to provide a catalogue of potentially deleterious mutations likely to affect the function of these genes. moreover, we have also detected indications that some of these variants might be associated with growth and fatness giving new insights in regard to the potential phenotypic relevance of polymorphisms within these genes.

RESULTS
sequencing statistics
we initially selected 459 kb of target genomic dna  covering the exons from the  <dig> tasrs and  <dig> ar genes. after genome capturing, sequencing and read mapping, we successfully covered 372 kb of target sequence with a read depth at each nucleotide position  above  <dig>  in the  <dig> libraries as a whole. this corresponds to 81 % of the initial target size and  <dig> genes fully or partially sequenced to a dp >  <dig> . the poorly sequenced genes include tas2r <dig>  enssscg <dig> , and  <dig> ar genes. the list of successfully sequenced genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  after genome capture, sequencing and read mapping,  <dig> , <dig> reads mapped to the target gdna regions.

variant identification in tasr and ar genes
we successfully sequenced   <dig>  bp  of tasr exons and identified  <dig> coding variants in tasr exons,  <dig> of which  do not have a dbsnp identifier and are thus considered novel . two tasr variants had the alternative allele fixed in the  <dig> pools and are thus likely to be either errors or private variants in the duroc animal used to generate the reference sequence. we excluded them from our list of putative polymorphisms. ten of the  <dig> remaining variants were classified by snpeff to have a high impact  on the coding sequence and consequently, on the function of the gene according to the gene annotation in the swine genome . these include four single nucleotide variants  and six short indels, which cause three stop-codon gains, one stop-codon loss, five frame-shift, and one novel splice-site donor. these variants affect four tasrs with a clear over-representation in tas1r <dig> . three of these variants affecting tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig> had a predicted minor allele frequency  ≤  <dig>  . in addition, we identified  <dig> non-synonymous-coding variants and one codon-deletion, which are classified by snpeff as having a moderate  impact. thirty-four of the non-synonymous changes were predicted to be deleterious  by sift  <cit>  . the remaining m variants were either sift predicted as tolerated  or did not yield any prediction. hence, we have identified  <dig> variants  that are likely to have an important effect on swine tasr function. remarkably, all tasrs showed h or mdel variants . finally,  <dig> variants were predicted to be synonymous changes with no apparent impact  on the subjacent proteins . on average, the variants with strong impact on protein sequence  were predicted to be rarer in the species than those having a mild impact   according to pmaf.table  <dig> number of variants across the tasr and ar gene groups per each impact class

the percentages are for the total number of variants within the groups: tasr strong impact, tasr mild impact, ar strong impact and ar mild impact

likewise, we sequenced  <dig>   bp of exonic sequence from ar genes at a dp >  <dig> , and identified  <dig>  variant positions in ar exons, most of which were bi-allelic snvs.  <dig>   variants were not annotated in dbsnp . four of these positions were multi-allelic with each allele predicted to have a different effect on protein sequence. of the  <dig>  assigned variant effects,  <dig> had the alternative allele fixed in the  <dig> pools. from the remaining  <dig>  variants,  <dig> were classified as deleterious  and affected  <dig> genes . as for tasrs, h and mdel as a whole tended to have lower pmaf than mtol and l . we identified 74 h variants in ar genes,  <dig> of which had pmafs ≤  <dig>  and are thus considered rare. these h rare variants affected  <dig> genes .

we also plotted the distribution of the ar gene variants predicted to have a strong impact on protein  and those with a mild impact  along the protein sequence divided in  <dig> consecutive position bins of equal amino acid length. we noted that the strong impact variants tended to be more abundant at the end of the protein , and that these also tended to have, on average, larger pmaf. this trend was not observed in the set of mild impact variants .fig.  <dig> distribution and pmaf of strong  and mild  impact variants along the protein body of ar genes. the bar plots for  the strong impact effect variants were made with  <dig> premature stop, frame-shift and mdel. the barplot for the mild impact effect variants  were made with  <dig>  mtol, in-frame indels and synonymous variants. the dots indicate the average pmaf in each of the  <dig> position percentile bins. percentile bins divide the protein body of each gene in ten portions of equal size



per breed variant distribution
we compared the ten purebred pools and observed that, as expected, larger pools contained more variants . nonetheless, the two duroc pools together, with  <dig> samples, displayed less genetic diversity , than the large white, landrace and the pietrain, which had a similar number of animals and were above  <dig>  variants each . the asian pool harboured the largest number of variants  while the iberian pool was ranked as the most homogenous . overall, we observed that the most ancient breeds, mangalitza, iberian, majorcan black were less variable in our set of genes . given that a higher number of samples seem to be correlated to a higher number of variants, we also compared the genetic variability using the watterson estimate  <cit>  at the neutrally evolving synonymous sites , which corrects the number of mutated sites by the number of animals included in the analysis. this value  showed that all the populations had similar variability with the exception of the asian pool, which genetic variability doubled that of the other breeds.table  <dig> number of variants and number of unique variants within each breed and per impact class

this table was done using the  <dig>  variants in tasr and ar genes including the multi-allelic with different effects and these with the alternative allele fixed in all the populations


apercentage of variants that are breed-specific



we also compared the percentage of variants that were h or mdel per breed. no obvious differences were observed  and the duroc and landrace were at the top  and bottom  ends, respectively .

altogether,  <dig> tasr variants were present in a single breed at paaf ≥  <dig>  and might thus be breed-specific. not surprisingly, the asian pool, which involved  <dig> chinese meishan and  <dig> vietnamese pigs, showed the highest proportion of pool-specific variants, with  <dig> being present only in this group . the wild boar also displayed several allelic particularities, with nine unique variants. noteworthy, seven of these wild boar variants, all with similar paaf, mapped to tas2r <dig> . overall, five  breed-specific variants were predicted to have a strong impact on protein sequence . the h variant is a stop gain in tas1r <dig> that is present in 17 % of the mangalitza genomes, respectively. we also identified two variants, a synonymous  and a non-synonymous tolerated  snvs that affect tas2r <dig>  that whilst being present at very high frequencies or even fixed in all breeds , were absent in the asian pool .

we detected  <dig> ar coding variants that were uniquely present or absent in one breed . of these,  <dig> variants involving  <dig> genes were predicted to be of functional importance . as in tasrs, the breed specific h and mdel variants in the ar genes were more abundant in the asian and the wild boar with  <dig> and five unique features, respectively. it was noteworthy that two of these h and mdel variants, both in the asian pools, were close to fixation . these variants map to the serotonin receptor, htr3c, and to the cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp2a <dig> .

we performed hierarchical clustering using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  based on the  <dig>   variants that were present in at least one of the ten breeds and with paaf information available in all these populations. one-hundred variants were excluded from the purebred comparison since they were unique to the f <dig> animals. the resulting phylogenetic dendrogram is in line with what has been shown in other studies . briefly, the western  breeds cluster together and the asian pool form a separate branch. within the western cluster, the duroc is the only member of a distant branch whilst the european commercial breeds  belong to another sub-group and the more ancient breeds iberian, majorcan black, and mangalitza cluster together with the wild boar.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic dendrogram with the  <dig> breeds. the numbers indicate the support for each node according to  <dig>  bootstrap iterations



paaf and phenotype relationships in the f <dig> groups
we also wanted to see whether we were able to detect an indication of an effect of the variants on production traits. this was investigated by comparing the paafs of two f <dig> pools from the same experimental population, each belonging to one of the tails of the phenotypic distribution, for average daily gain and retroperitoneal fat content. out of the  <dig> tasr coding variants,  <dig> segregated in the f <dig> resource, and within these, eight displayed significantly different paafs in five tasrs . remarkably, four tas2r <dig> variants showed significant differences between the pools. likewise, we could compare  <dig>  variants in ar genes segregating in this population and identified  <dig> significant differences  involving  <dig> genes . after correcting for multiple testing  =  <dig> ), one m variant in tas2r <dig> and three variants in cd <dig> remained significant .table  <dig> genes with variants showing significantly different paaf between f2_f and f2_l

selection and genotype-based validation of a set of protein-damaging variants
with the double aim to validate the subset of variants with more likely damaging impact and, to evaluate by genetic association, their impact in pig breeding, we designed a taqman genotyping assay targeting  <dig> putative polymorphisms. we originally aimed at including all the h variants found in the study and to fill the remaining of the assay with several m variants to cover all tasrs and several ar genes. however, the assay had design requirements that not all the variants fulfilled. hence, we could only include nine h variants in tasr, 69 h variants in ar genes, 33 m variants in tasrs and 17 m variants in ar genes. to validate the selected variants, we genotyped  <dig>  of the  <dig> sequenced pigs. we could not genotype the remaining  <dig> pigs as all their dna was used for the sequencing step. 9 % of the assays failed to either amplify or clearly differentiate the genotype clusters, and 46 % did not show the alternative allele in any sample.  <dig> variants identified in our variant calling pipeline were validated by the taqman assay. the  <dig> polymorphisms  affect eight tasrs and  <dig> ar genes . all genotyped variants showed to be in hardy-weinberg equilibrium across breeds . although none of the four genotyped rare polymorphisms  showed a homozygote state for the minor allele, one h snv , unique to the vietnamese pigs and with a maf slightly above the rare variant threshold , was found in the homozygous state in two animals. this variant was predicted to cause a stop codon gain in the very last amino acid of the canonical htr1a protein. another introduction of a stop codon  was found in the middle of the gamma aminobutyric acid receptor gabrg <dig>  and was present only in meishan pigs showing a maf =  <dig> . we next compared the predicted and the matched genotype-observed frequency of the minor allele and detected a strong correlation  between the two .fig.  <dig> linear regression and correlation between pmaf and the genotype observed maf in the  <dig> genotyped polymorphisms



we also carried a genetic association analysis with the genotypes and phenotypic values for retroperitoneal fat and daily gain in the f <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> variants segregated in the f <dig> animals. the array contains two of the variants  that showed significant paaf differences between the f <dig> groups with the fisher test. for daily gain, only the marker chr2_3566521_a_c was nominally significant   but it did not reach significance after bonferroni correction for multiple testing . for retroperitoneal fat, two markers, chr9_46397500_a_g and chr18_7019387_a_t, were nominally significant  but again, none reached statistical significance after bonferroni correction . chr18_7019623_g_a, which was significant at the paaf comparison between both f <dig> groups, did not reach significance for any of the two traits .

discussion
tasrs and the components of the ar circuitry are key genes in keeping body homeostasis as they recognize chemical molecules that could be both sources of energy or threatening toxins and promote an adequate response. with the aim to characterize the coding genetic variation affecting swine tasrs and the ar circuitry genes, we sequenced  <dig> gdna pools corresponding to  <dig> pigs from ten breeds and european wild boar and from two pools of an experimental f <dig> population with records on growth and retroperitoneal fat content. we have mapped thousands of coding region genetic variants, hundreds of which are expected to have a strong impact on protein sequence, some of which are breed specific. by comparing the paafs of these variants in two f <dig> pools divergent for growth and fat deposition, we also identified many genotype - phenotype relationships. our data provides detailed information of the genetic variation present in tasrs and ar genes. we also developed an assay to genotype  <dig> of the most functionally relevant variants which is available to perform association studies with relevant traits in pig populations.

technical considerations
differences in dna extraction methods and inaccuracies with respect to quantification might have a negative impact on the even distribution of sequencing reads among the genomes within a pool thereby reducing the accuracy of the paaf/pmafs as a proxy of the real allelic frequency. nonetheless, the comparison of predicted versus observed allele frequencies in the  <dig> genotyped variants showed that paaf/pmafs were very good predictors and supply additional confidence of the quality of our results .

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study from a targeted genome enrichment experiment in swine. as this approach reduces the sequencing throughput requirements, we were able to sequence the target sub-genome  in the largest number of pigs  reported to date, in a single experiment. by mapping nearly  <dig> million reads on the target exons, we reached an average depth of sequencing of 72× for each of the haploid genomes. this read depth allowed us to detect all variants present in the pools regardless of their frequency. given that we sequenced  <dig> animals harbouring in total  <dig> chromosome sets , we were able to detect rare variants with maf ≥  <dig> . no previous high throughput sequencing study in pigs reached this sensitivity to detect rare variants. we identified a large number of variant events, most mapping to exon flanking regions including promoters, introns, and upstream and downstream segments. although some of these non-coding variants could be functional, their regulatory relevance is difficult to predict and was not the subject of our study, which focused mainly, on the detection of protein-damaging coding variation.

variant identification
overall, we have identified  <dig>  coding variants but  <dig> of these are fixed in our sample set and are thus likely to be either errors in or private to the reference sequence. we annotated  <dig> variants segregating in the  <dig> canonical swine tasrs in our samples. da silva et al.  <cit>  described  <dig> coding variants in their list of  <dig> taste and nutrient receptor genes after sequencing  <dig> pigs. however, da silva and co-authors included  <dig> genes that we did not study. these are  <dig> likely-paralogs of canonical tasrs and  <dig> genes that are not canonical tasrs but that are related to tasting fat  and amino acids . on the contrary, we included  <dig> canonical tasrs  not studied by da silva et al. moreover,  <dig> we classified as ar genes  that are shared in both studies as they are not canonical tasrs or are receptors belonging to the glutamate pathway.  <dig> of the  <dig> variants,  <dig> in canonical tasr and  <dig> in the other shared genes, are common to both studies. the difference in the catalogue of identified variants is likely to be mostly due to the fact that da silva et al. studied a different set of animals, some belonging to breeds we did not target .  <dig> of the  <dig>  “segregating” variants are predicted to have a high impact  on the protein sequence of  <dig> genes and are thus very likely to disrupt or strongly alter their function . some of these variants showed allelic frequency relationship with daily gain and retro-peritoneal fat deposition in the f <dig> resource with phenotypic records . in keeping with previous findings in human  <cit> , we also detected that h and m variants tend to be more abundant and have higher paafs in tasrs than in non-sensory genes  which indicates that tasrs are subject to balancing selection. tasrs are comparable to the major histocompatibility complex genes  as both are expressed at the surface of cells to detect particular molecules that could be hazardous for the body. whilst hla and sla detect antigens to promote an immune reaction, tasrs sense chemical compounds to stimulate appropriate responses  depending on the cell type that is involved. thus, a healthy animal population needs to be highly polymorphic in these genes in order to maximize its adaptability and survival to variable environments facing multiple threads. as expected, h and mdel variants had on average, lower pmafs than mtol or l variants , as the former are more likely to be deleterious and consequently, subject to purifying selection. this is well exemplified by the recent exome sequencing experiments that have successfully identified rare deleterious variants causing rare and severe mendelian disorders in humans  <cit> . indeed, h and mdel variants are more abundant and frequent at the 3′-end of the protein, where they are less likely to have an impact of the function of the protein .

h rare variants
remarkably, we found  <dig> rare h variants which mapped to tas1r <dig>  tas1r <dig> and  <dig> ar genes . these mutations are predicted to fully disrupt the function of the affected gene and might thus have an impact on taste and ar perceptions. eight of the  <dig> ar genes carrying rare h variants, have been directly associated to taste, food intake, body size, diabetes or triglyceride levels. two of them, grm <dig> and gabrr <dig>  are glutamate receptors that have been associated to body size  <cit>  and feeding behaviour  <cit> , respectively. natural knock-out pigs,  in these genes may have severe consequences in taste perception and feeding attitude. reverse genetics experiments to study the phenotypic changes that occur in such natural knock-outs would be very informative to understand the importance of these mutations on feeding behaviour and on a broad range of other traits of relevance in animal breeding and bio-medical sciences. however, the identification of such homozygotes may require the screening of thousands of pigs. a convenient alternative would be to identify heterozygous animals and cross them to generate these natural knock-outs.

breed particularities
we found several variants with breed particularities that could both explain in part the population history of these breeds and be the result of genetic adaptation to the particular environment or artificial selection. overall, the pools of commercial breeds  contained more variants than the pools of the ancient/traditional breeds . the sequencing of the commercial breeds involved a larger number of samples and consequently, more genetic variation could be captured. this difference is possibly due also to first, population bottlenecks and a low effective population size within ancient breeds and second, to the introgression of asian germplasm in the european commercial breeds  <cit>  . the duroc pool is somehow in between european commercial and traditional breeds, with a relative low number of variants . however, this was expected as the pig reference genome sequence was obtained from a duroc animal and is therefore expected to share more similarities with our duroc pool. on the other hand, the asian breeds showed the largest number of variants  which was also expected as our pool was made of two different swine populations  and also, these animals diverged from the european counterparts around one million years ago  <cit> . it is worth pointing out that as we merged the meishan and the vietnamese pigs, we cannot have specific information for these populations. although the comparison of both asian breeds would have been interesting, our aim was not to study the genetic variation within these breeds but to identify a large catalogue of variants by sequencing a set of divergent populations. for this reason, and to optimise the high throughput sequencing resources, we merged all asian animals.

although we tried to minimise co-ancestry between samples, we do not have pedigree data and hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that the trend on the reduction in the genetic diversity observed in some breeds is due to close familiar relationships. this is particularly true for our mangalitza samples, which come from a highly inbred population from romania and might thus not represent the genetic diversity existing within the mangalitza breed as a whole. to better determine genetic diversity within each breed, we compared the genetic variability in the synonymous sites, which are considered to be neutral in evolutionary terms, in our tasr and ar genes using the method described by watterson. this method corrects the number of variants by the number of individuals that were analysed  <cit> . we further corrected these values by the expected number of silent sites in the sequenced cds. genetic variability among western breeds is highly similar  being lowest in duroc and highest in pietrain. the genetic variability seems to be higher in the asian pool .

we also compared the relative abundance of h + mdel variants in each breed. in contrast to the recent results by bianco and co-authors  <cit>  who detected a higher ratio of deleterious variants in western than in asian breeds, we did not identify large differences across pools. this inconsistency could be explained by the fact that we interrogated a particular set of genes whilst bianco et al. assessed all annotated genes in the pig genome. also, both studies screened different animals from distinct breeds. furthermore, the two studies used different sequencing strategies. whilst we deep-sequenced  <dig> pigs in a pool-based strategy, bianco et al. performed low depth whole-genome shotgun sequencing of  <dig> pigs. our approach is better suited for the identification of rare variants and this difference could have altered the catalogue of variants identified in both studies. therefore, the comparison of the two datasets needs to be taken with caution. of note, we observed that 25 % of the  <dig> variants identified in tas2r <dig> were wild boar specific . this could indicate a particular haplotype that might have been lost in the european domestic breeds by artificial selection. alternatively, as our wild boar gdna pool was made with samples from three different european locations , these variants, which have a relatively low paaf , could well belong to one of these populations with no germplasm contributed to the analyzed domestic breeds. noteworthy, some of these tas2r <dig> variants are predicted to have a strong effect on the protein and could thus indicate adaptive selection to particular foods or environments . especially relevant are the breed-specific h variants with relatively high frequency in the affected breed  . the stop codon that prematurely truncates tas1r <dig> right in the middle of the protein in 17 % of the mangalitza genomes might impair the ability to sense umami and might thus affect food preferences in a similar way as described in giant pandas, which lack a functional tas1r <dig> potentially disrupting preferences for protein-rich sources  <cit> . furthermore, two h variants in htr3c, and cyp2a <dig> are unique and almost fixed in the asian breeds . as the paaf between asian and european pools are so dramatically different, we hypothesize that this might reflect an ar adaptation to very different environments.

variant and phenotype relationships
in our study, we aimed not only at identifying damaging variants but also at checking whether we were able to detect potential relationships with production traits. this comparison was done with only  <dig> pigs, which would typically be a very small number of animals and as such, the power to detect genetic associations is low. thus, it does not aim at finding statistically significant genetic associations but at detecting a trend that could indicate this association. indeed, we identified several allele - phenotype relationships that could indicate real genetic associations . we believe that comparing the paafs of the two f <dig> pools was a good strategy for the identification of allele - phenotype relationships, as these animals share a common genetic background and the only criteria used to make the pools, was their extreme and opposed phenotypic characteristics. four of the  <dig>  tas2r <dig> variants segregating in our f <dig> resource showed significant differences at the nominal level in paaf between the obese and fast growing f2_f pool and the lean slow growing f2_l pool . as this is a large percentage, we believe that this could be a real association and that a polymorphism, perhaps a regulatory variant not assessed here, is in part responsible of the phenotypic differences between the divergent groups of pigs. five of the six genes with significant allelic differences at the nominal level  between the f <dig> pools have been directly linked to both taste and growth   and could thus indicate a difference in the eating behaviour. this would explain the difference in growth and fat deposition between the f <dig> groups. remarkably, three variants in cd <dig>  a gene associated to fat taste, had significant paaf differences between the high and the low fat deposition pigs after correction for multiple testing .

two of the markers, chr2_3566521_a_c and chr18_7019623_g_a, in the aldh3b <dig> ortholog enssscg <dig> and in tas2r <dig>  respectively, were also genotyped in the f <dig> animals with taqman probes using the openarray technology. only chr2_3566521_a_c was nominally significant for daily gain , but did not reach the significance threshold after multiple testing . chr18_7019623_g_a was not significant, but a marker 236 bp upstream from this snp, chr18_7019387_a_t, was nominally significant  for retroperitoneal fat content . we seek to screen larger populations with phenotypic data to determine whether these associations could become significant.

selection and genotype-based validation of snps
we also developed a genotyping array to validate the variants with highest damaging potential regardless of their frequency. we believe that a proportion of the  <dig> non-polymorphic positions might be real low-frequency polymorphisms that were present only in animals that we did not genotype due to the lack of available gdna. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these variants could simply be false positives caused by the erroneous mapping of some reads to highly similar regions. for example, none of the  <dig> frame-shift variants we included could be confirmed as a polymorphism but the high false positive rate among indels in high throughput sequencing experiments is well documented. most of the h variants failed to proof polymorphic but they had very low pmafs whilst most of the m variants, which on average showed higher pmafs, were confirmed . none of the rare h polymorphisms displayed the homozygous state for the minor allele in the genotyped samples. however, we identified two h variants that approached the rare maf threshold, which showed the three genotypic classes in our animals . the vietnamese rare variant in htr1a is a stop codon that was homozygous in two vietnamese pigs. nonetheless, we cannot consider these two animals as natural knockouts as this mutation is located at the very last amino acid of the canonical htr1a protein, and it is not expected to have an impact on htr1a function. therefore, the low frequency of the minor allele might not reflect the existence of purifying selection forces. the meishan h variant in gabrg <dig> is also an introduction of a stop codon, but this is located in the middle of the gene and is thus likely to disrupt its function. this gene increases neuronal activity and is associated to eating disorders and anxiety  <cit>  and even with alcohol dependence in humans. thus, natural gabrg <dig> knock-out pigs carrying this stop codon may show both signs of anxiety and a particular eating behaviour.

we have developed the first assay for massive genotyping of variants with high functional potential in swine tasr and ar genes, and we now seek to perform association analysis on pig populations with phenotypic records for eating attitude, feed intake, growth, obesity, but also on semen quality and fertility, infection and immunity and behaviour abnormalities such as stress-related stereotypies and tail biting. this approach will help us understanding the impact of genetic variation in tasr and ar genes on traits of interest for the pig breeding industry. this genotyping assay will also allow us to identify natural knock-outs that could then be used in reverse genetics studies. nonetheless, we acknowledge that this array tags a very small proportion  of the genes involved in taste, appetite and reward. ideally, the list of variants and genes should be extended to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the impact of these gene pathways in pig breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
we detected  <dig>  variants predicted to have a potential  impact in the protein sequence of  <dig> tasr and ar genes. of these,  <dig> were predicted to strongly impact on the protein sequence of the  <dig> tasrs and  <dig> ar genes and consequently, in their function. the importance of these genes in many traits contributing to body homeostasis has been well documented in human and animal models but remains unexplored in livestock. we have found significant relationships between the paaf of some variants and growth and fat deposition. this, albeit not more than a mere indication, strongly encourages further studying the effect of these genes on traits of interest in body homeostasis and animal breeding. for this reason, we have developed a genotyping array with a subset of these variants and have validated  <dig> by genotyping the initially sequenced animals. this array is now ready to be used in genetic association studies for relevant traits including taste preferences, food intake, fertility or behaviour. although this array is not comprehensive and does not contain all the variants that we identified, it contains a careful selection of the most likely deleterious variants and involves eight tasrs and  <dig> ar genes.
